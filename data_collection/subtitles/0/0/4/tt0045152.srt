1
00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,298
Singin' in the rain

2
00:00:22,372 --> 00:00:24,397
Just singin' in the rain

3
00:00:24,474 --> 00:00:26,533
What a glorious feelin'

4
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,577
We're happy again

5
00:00:28,645 --> 00:00:30,806
We'll walk down the lane

6
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,871
With a happy refrain

7
00:00:32,949 --> 00:00:35,417
And singin'
Just singin' in the rain

8
00:01:37,647 --> 00:01:39,979
This is Dora Bailey...

9
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,645
talking to you from the front of
the Chinese Theater in Hollywood.

10
00:01:44,721 --> 00:01:47,815
What a night, ladies and gentlemen!

11
00:01:47,891 --> 00:01:50,325
Every star in
Hollywood's heaven is here...

12
00:01:50,393 --> 00:01:54,056
to make Monumental Pictures'
premiere of 'The Royal Rascal'...

13
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:57,361
the outstanding event of 1927.

14
00:01:57,433 --> 00:01:59,492
Everyone is breathlessly awaiting...

15
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:03,505
the arrival of Lina Lamont
and Don Lockwood.

16
00:02:03,573 --> 00:02:05,734
Look who's arriving now!

17
00:02:05,809 --> 00:02:08,437
It's that famous
Zip Girl of the screen...

18
00:02:08,511 --> 00:02:12,811
the darling of the flapper set,
Zelda Zanders.

19
00:02:14,217 --> 00:02:16,617
Zelda! Oh, Zelda!

20
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:21,248
With her new red-hot pash,
J. Cumberland Spendrill III...

21
00:02:21,324 --> 00:02:23,792
that well-known eligible bachelor.

22
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:26,795
Zelda's had so much unhappiness.

23
00:02:26,863 --> 00:02:30,492
I hope this time it's really love.

24
00:02:30,567 --> 00:02:34,867
And here comes that exotic star,
Olga Mara...

25
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,975
and her new husband,
the Baron de la Bonnet de la Toulon.

26
00:02:42,045 --> 00:02:44,536
They've been married
two months already...

27
00:02:44,614 --> 00:02:47,105
but still as happy as newlyweds.

28
00:02:48,551 --> 00:02:50,280
Well, well, well.

29
00:02:50,353 --> 00:02:52,719
It's Cosmo Brown!

30
00:02:58,795 --> 00:03:01,059
Cosmo is Don Lockwood's best friend.

31
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:05,931
He plays the piano for Don and Lina
to get them into those romantic moods.

32
00:03:06,002 --> 00:03:09,301
Oh, folks, this is it!

33
00:03:16,346 --> 00:03:20,749
The stars of tonight's picture,
those romantic lovers of the screen...

34
00:03:20,817 --> 00:03:23,684
Don Lockwood and Lina Lamont!

35
00:03:29,492 --> 00:03:33,019
Ladies and gentlemen,
when you look at this gorgeous couple...

36
00:03:33,096 --> 00:03:36,793
it's no wonder they're
a household name all over the world...

37
00:03:36,866 --> 00:03:39,027
like bacon and eggs.

38
00:03:39,836 --> 00:03:42,270
Lockwood and Lamont.

39
00:03:44,874 --> 00:03:47,536
Don, you can tell me confidentially...

40
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:51,239
are these rumors true that wedding bells
are soon to ring for you and Lina?

41
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:56,047
Lina and I have no statement to make
right now. We're just good friends.

42
00:03:56,119 --> 00:04:00,317
You've come a long way together, Don.
Won't you tell us how it all happened?

43
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:03,655
Well, Lina and I have made
a number of pictures together...

44
00:04:03,726 --> 00:04:07,389
No, no, Don.
I want your story from the beginning.

45
00:04:07,463 --> 00:04:10,330
Dora, not in front
of all these people.

46
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,028
Yes!

47
00:04:13,102 --> 00:04:16,731
But, Don, the story of your success
is an inspiration...

48
00:04:16,806 --> 00:04:19,366
to young people all over the world.

49
00:04:19,442 --> 00:04:22,570
- Please.
- Yes!

50
00:04:24,247 --> 00:04:27,148
Well, to begin with,
any story of my career...

51
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:31,016
would have to include
my lifelong friend, Cosmo Brown!

52
00:04:31,087 --> 00:04:34,056
We were kids together,
grew up together, worked together.

53
00:04:34,123 --> 00:04:35,920
Yes?

54
00:04:35,992 --> 00:04:40,452
Well, Dora, I've had one motto
which I've always lived by:

55
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,797
Dignity.

56
00:04:42,865 --> 00:04:44,924
Always dignity.

57
00:04:45,001 --> 00:04:49,529
This was instilled in me by Mom and Dad
from the very beginning.

58
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:52,836
They sent me to the finest schools,
including dancing school.

59
00:04:52,909 --> 00:04:55,207
That's where I first met Cosmo.

60
00:04:55,278 --> 00:04:59,339
And with him, I used to perform for
all of Mom and Dad's society friends.

61
00:05:07,156 --> 00:05:09,954
They used to make such a fuss over me.

62
00:05:10,026 --> 00:05:14,963
If I was good, I was allowed to
accompany Mom and Dad to the theater.

63
00:05:15,198 --> 00:05:18,565
They brought me up on Shaw, Moliere...

64
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:21,660
the finest of the classics.

65
00:05:21,738 --> 00:05:26,141
To this was added musical training
at the Conservatory of Fine Arts.

66
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,182
We rounded out our apprenticeship...

67
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:36,684
at the most exclusive
dramatics academy.

68
00:05:37,954 --> 00:05:39,945
And at all times...

69
00:05:40,023 --> 00:05:43,254
the motto remained: Dignity.

70
00:05:43,326 --> 00:05:45,260
Always dignity.

71
00:05:47,497 --> 00:05:51,433
In a few years, Cosmo and I embarked
on a dance concert tour.

72
00:05:52,368 --> 00:05:55,428
We played the finest
symphonic halls in the country.

73
00:05:56,606 --> 00:05:58,733
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

74
00:05:58,808 --> 00:06:01,140
I can jump over the moon up above

75
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:03,644
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

76
00:06:05,314 --> 00:06:07,407
Haven't a worry, haven't a care

77
00:06:07,483 --> 00:06:09,781
Feel like a feather
that's floatin' on air

78
00:06:09,852 --> 00:06:12,150
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

79
00:06:13,823 --> 00:06:15,916
Soon the church bells
will be ringin'

80
00:06:15,992 --> 00:06:18,153
And a march with Ma and Pa

81
00:06:18,227 --> 00:06:20,354
All the church bells will be ringin'

82
00:06:20,430 --> 00:06:22,990
With a hey-nonny-nonny
and a hot-cha-cha

83
00:06:23,066 --> 00:06:25,159
Hi-diddle-diddle, my baby's okay

84
00:06:25,234 --> 00:06:27,600
Ask me a riddle, I'm happy to say

85
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:30,161
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love

86
00:07:28,898 --> 00:07:31,389
Audiences everywhere adored us.

87
00:07:33,803 --> 00:07:36,795
Finally, we decided
to come to sunny California.

88
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,039
We were stranded...

89
00:07:39,108 --> 00:07:43,977
We were staying here when the offers
from movie studios started pouring in.

90
00:07:44,046 --> 00:07:48,710
We sorted them out and decided
to favor Monumental Pictures.

91
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:52,447
Okay, Lina, you hate him.
Keep that mood music going.

92
00:07:52,522 --> 00:07:56,151
Phil, you come in. Keep on grinding.
Now you see her.

93
00:07:56,225 --> 00:07:59,160
Now here's the bit, Bert,
where you get it on the jaw.

94
00:08:00,596 --> 00:08:03,793
Cut! No, no!
That wasn't right, Bert!

95
00:08:03,866 --> 00:08:07,324
You were supposed to go over the bar
and crash into the glasses!

96
00:08:07,403 --> 00:08:10,236
Try it again, okay, Bert? Bert!

97
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,638
Oh, that's just swell!

98
00:08:12,708 --> 00:08:16,200
Take him away, fellas.
You'll be all right, Bert.

99
00:08:16,279 --> 00:08:18,941
We've lost more darn stuntmen
on this picture!

100
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:21,950
It'll take hours to get
a new one over from central casting!

101
00:08:22,018 --> 00:08:24,179
Mr. Dexter, I can do that.

102
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,051
- You're a musician!
- That's a moot point.

103
00:08:27,123 --> 00:08:29,148
No kidding!
What's your name?

104
00:08:29,225 --> 00:08:31,955
Don Lockwood, sir,
but the fellas call me Donald.

105
00:08:32,028 --> 00:08:34,826
Wise guy, huh?
Okay, I'll try you.

106
00:08:34,897 --> 00:08:36,990
Get this guy into Bert's suit!

107
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:41,196
And remember, Lockwood, you might be
trading that fiddle in for a harp!

108
00:08:43,472 --> 00:08:44,905
Camera!

109
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:48,801
Phil, come in!
Now you see him!

110
00:08:48,878 --> 00:08:51,312
Here's where you get it
right on the jaw!

111
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,108
Cut! That was wonderful!

112
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:00,188
You got any more little chores
you want done?

113
00:09:00,256 --> 00:09:01,689
Plenty.

114
00:09:27,583 --> 00:09:31,075
My roles in these films were urbane...

115
00:09:31,153 --> 00:09:33,383
sophisticated, suave.

116
00:09:36,559 --> 00:09:39,528
And of course,
all through those pictures...

117
00:09:39,595 --> 00:09:43,087
Lina was, as always,
an inspiration to me.

118
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:46,965
Warm and helpful. A real lady.

119
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:54,137
Hello, Miss Lamont.
I'm Don Lockwood, the stuntman.

120
00:09:56,345 --> 00:09:59,314
It was sure a thrill
working with you, Miss Lamont.

121
00:09:59,382 --> 00:10:03,842
Don, I want you to meet the producer
of the picture, Mr. R.F. Simpson.

122
00:10:03,919 --> 00:10:07,946
I just saw some rushes for the picture
and asked Dexter who the stuntmen were.

123
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:10,492
He told me they were all you.

124
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:13,460
I'm putting you and Lina together
in a picture. Come to my office.

125
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:16,930
- We'll discuss a contract.
- Thanks, Mr. Simpson!

126
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:23,705
Are you doing anything tonight,
Miss Lamont?

127
00:10:25,408 --> 00:10:28,377
Well, that's funny.
I'm busy.

128
00:10:33,516 --> 00:10:37,782
Lina and I have had the same
wonderful relationship ever since.

129
00:10:37,853 --> 00:10:42,256
But most important of all,
I continue living up to my motto:

130
00:10:42,325 --> 00:10:43,917
Dignity.

131
00:10:43,993 --> 00:10:45,790
Always dignity.

132
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:48,863
Thank you, Don.

133
00:10:48,931 --> 00:10:53,527
And I'm sure you and Lina will continue
making movie history tonight...

134
00:10:53,602 --> 00:10:57,800
in your greatest picture,
'The Royal Rascal.'

135
00:11:02,144 --> 00:11:04,078
Get enough, boys?

136
00:11:40,816 --> 00:11:42,784
She's so refined.

137
00:11:42,852 --> 00:11:45,218
I think I'll kill myself.

138
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:27,818
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

139
00:12:30,466 --> 00:12:33,799
We're pretty darn thrilled at your
response to 'The Royal Rascal.'

140
00:12:33,869 --> 00:12:37,600
We had fun making it, and we hope
you had fun seeing it tonight.

141
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:44,044
We screen actors aren't much good
at speaking in public...

142
00:12:44,113 --> 00:12:47,082
so we'll just act out our thanks.

143
00:12:58,327 --> 00:12:58,360
It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson?

144
00:12:58,395 --> 00:13:00,328
It's a smash, eh, Mr. Simpson?

145
00:13:00,396 --> 00:13:03,229
- Don. Lina, you were gorgeous.
- You look pretty good for a girl.

146
00:13:03,299 --> 00:13:05,824
For heaven's sake, what's the big idea?

147
00:13:05,901 --> 00:13:09,928
Can't a girl get a word in edgewise?
After all, they're my public too!

148
00:13:10,005 --> 00:13:13,304
The publicity department, Rod here,
thought it would be much better...

149
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:15,366
if Don made the speeches
for the team.

150
00:13:15,444 --> 00:13:16,706
Why?

151
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:20,010
You're a beautiful woman. Audiences
think you've got a voice to match.

152
00:13:20,082 --> 00:13:23,245
The studio's gotta keep their stars
from looking ridiculous at any cost.

153
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,618
- No one's got that much money.
- What's wrong with the way I talk?

154
00:13:26,689 --> 00:13:29,920
What's the big idea?
Am I dumb or something?

155
00:13:30,993 --> 00:13:34,156
No. It's just that Don's
had so much more experience...

156
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:37,893
Next time, write me out a speech.
I could memorize it.

157
00:13:37,967 --> 00:13:41,198
Why don't you go out now
and recite the Gettysburg Address?

158
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:46,003
What do you know about it,
you piano player? Are you anybody?

159
00:13:46,075 --> 00:13:50,512
Donnie, how can you let him
talk to me like that, your fiance?

160
00:13:50,579 --> 00:13:52,376
My fian...

161
00:13:52,448 --> 00:13:55,884
Now, Lina, you've been reading
those fan magazines again.

162
00:13:55,951 --> 00:13:59,318
You shouldn't believe
all that banana oil...

163
00:13:59,388 --> 00:14:01,720
that Dora Bailey
and the columnists dish out.

164
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,851
Now try to get this straight.
There is nothing between us.

165
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,489
There has never been
anything between us. Just air.

166
00:14:09,565 --> 00:14:11,999
Oh, Donnie, you don't mean that.

167
00:14:12,067 --> 00:14:14,331
Come on. We'll be late
for R.F.'s party.

168
00:14:14,403 --> 00:14:18,169
You better go in separate cars
to break up the mobs, huh?

169
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:21,038
Ta-ta, Donnie! See ya there!

170
00:14:22,344 --> 00:14:26,303
Donnie. What's wrong with that girl?
Can't she take a gentle hint?

171
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:29,681
Haven't you heard? She's irresistible.
She told me so herself.

172
00:14:29,752 --> 00:14:33,313
I can't shake her. This cooked-up
romance, just for publicity.

173
00:14:33,389 --> 00:14:36,085
The price of fame.
You've got the glory.

174
00:14:36,158 --> 00:14:39,184
You've gotta take the little heartaches
that go with it. Look at me.

175
00:14:39,261 --> 00:14:43,254
I got no glory. I got no fame.
I got no mansions. I got no money.

176
00:14:43,332 --> 00:14:45,800
But I've got...
What have I got?

177
00:14:45,868 --> 00:14:49,031
- I don't know. What?
- I gotta get outta here.

178
00:14:57,980 --> 00:15:00,448
Don't tell me.
It's a flat tire.

179
00:15:00,516 --> 00:15:03,952
I don't understand. This car hasn't
given me trouble for six hours.

180
00:15:04,019 --> 00:15:05,509
There's Don Lockwood!

181
00:15:06,355 --> 00:15:08,755
- Give me your autograph!
- Hi, kids!

182
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:11,315
I want a souvenir!

183
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:15,159
- I want a souvenir too!
- Hold on there!

184
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:17,164
You're tearing my...

185
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:19,826
Hey, Cos, call me a cab!

186
00:15:19,902 --> 00:15:21,164
Okay, you're a cab.

187
00:15:21,236 --> 00:15:23,261
Thanks a lot!

188
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:40,217
- Lady, keep driving.
- Get out of here!

189
00:15:40,289 --> 00:15:42,780
- I'll call the police!
- Don't do that.

190
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,827
- Don't hurt me!
- I'm not a criminal.

191
00:15:45,894 --> 00:15:49,091
You are a criminal!
I've seen that face before.

192
00:15:49,164 --> 00:15:51,792
- You're a famous gangster!
- Let me explain...

193
00:15:51,867 --> 00:15:55,200
I've seen your picture
in the post office. Officer!

194
00:15:55,270 --> 00:15:57,602
This man jumped into my car...

195
00:15:57,673 --> 00:16:00,267
- Why, it's Don Lockwood!
- Don Lockwood?

196
00:16:00,342 --> 00:16:03,436
- Out for a joyride?
- Just a lift, Officer.

197
00:16:03,512 --> 00:16:05,503
My car broke down,
I got surrounded...

198
00:16:05,581 --> 00:16:08,015
You're a lucky lady.
Anything wrong?

199
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:11,052
- Why, no.
- I should think not. Good night.

200
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,918
Good night, Officer.

201
00:16:13,989 --> 00:16:18,358
Well, thanks for saving my life.
I'll get out now.

202
00:16:18,427 --> 00:16:21,362
I'm driving to Beverly Hills.
Can I drop you someplace?

203
00:16:21,430 --> 00:16:25,958
I'd like to get out of this torn suit
if you're going by Camden and Sunset.

204
00:16:26,035 --> 00:16:28,265
Yes, I am.

205
00:16:31,407 --> 00:16:34,808
I'd very much like to know
whose hospitality I'm enjoying.

206
00:16:34,877 --> 00:16:36,845
Selden. Kathy Selden.

207
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:39,073
Enchanted, Miss Selden.

208
00:16:39,148 --> 00:16:41,082
I'm sorry I frightened you.

209
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:44,551
I was getting a little too much love
from my adoring fans.

210
00:16:44,620 --> 00:16:47,453
Oh, that's what you were
running away from.

211
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,720
They did that to you?
That's terrible.

212
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,128
Yes, it is, isn't it?

213
00:16:56,198 --> 00:16:58,257
It is terrible.

214
00:16:58,333 --> 00:17:00,995
Well, we movie stars get the glory.

215
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:05,302
I guess we have to take
the little heartaches that go with it.

216
00:17:05,374 --> 00:17:08,571
People think we lead lives
of glamour and romance...

217
00:17:08,644 --> 00:17:11,272
but we're really lonely.

218
00:17:12,548 --> 00:17:14,175
Terribly lonely.

219
00:17:14,249 --> 00:17:18,879
Mr. Lockwood, I can't tell you how sorry
I am about taking you for a criminal...

220
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:21,548
but it was understandable
under the circumstances.

221
00:17:21,623 --> 00:17:25,719
- I knew I'd seen you.
- Which of my pictures have you seen?

222
00:17:25,794 --> 00:17:28,729
I don't remember.
I saw one once.

223
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:32,767
- You saw one once?
- You were dueling.

224
00:17:32,835 --> 00:17:36,965
There was a girl, Lina Lamont.
Though I don't go to the movies much.

225
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:40,008
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

226
00:17:41,510 --> 00:17:43,774
- Thank you.
- No offense.

227
00:17:43,846 --> 00:17:46,280
Movies are entertaining
enough for the masses...

228
00:17:46,348 --> 00:17:49,545
but the personalities on the screen
just don't impress me.

229
00:17:49,618 --> 00:17:53,349
They don't talk, they don't act.
They just make a lot of dumb show.

230
00:17:53,422 --> 00:17:55,356
Well, you know.

231
00:17:56,658 --> 00:17:58,319
Like that.

232
00:17:58,393 --> 00:18:00,953
You mean, like what I do?

233
00:18:01,029 --> 00:18:02,331
Well, yes.

234
00:18:02,366 --> 00:18:02,797
Well, yes.

235
00:18:02,865 --> 00:18:06,130
Here we are, Sunset and Camden.

236
00:18:07,402 --> 00:18:10,030
Wait a minute.
You mean, I'm not an actor?

237
00:18:10,105 --> 00:18:12,733
- Pantomime on the screen isn't acting?
- Of course not.

238
00:18:12,808 --> 00:18:16,335
Acting means great parts, wonderful
lines, speaking those glorious words.

239
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:18,208
- Words.
- Shakespeare, Ibsen.

240
00:18:18,280 --> 00:18:22,683
What's your lofty mission in life that
lets you sneer at my humble profession?

241
00:18:22,751 --> 00:18:25,413
Well, I'm an actress.
On the stage.

242
00:18:25,487 --> 00:18:27,421
Oh, on the stage.

243
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:29,923
I'd like to see you act.
What are you in now?

244
00:18:29,992 --> 00:18:33,257
I could brush up on my English
or bring along an interpreter...

245
00:18:33,328 --> 00:18:35,523
if they'd let in a movie actor.

246
00:18:35,597 --> 00:18:38,862
I'm not in a play now, but I will be.
I'm going to New York...

247
00:18:38,934 --> 00:18:42,927
You're going to New York.
Someday we'll all hear of you, won't we?

248
00:18:43,005 --> 00:18:46,372
Kathy Selden as Juliet,
as Lady Macbeth, as King Lear.

249
00:18:46,441 --> 00:18:48,375
You'll have to wear a beard
for that one.

250
00:18:48,443 --> 00:18:51,970
Laugh if you want to, but at least
the stage is a dignified profession.

251
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,174
What are you so conceited about?

252
00:18:54,249 --> 00:18:58,379
You're nothing but a shadow on film.
You're not flesh and blood.

253
00:18:58,453 --> 00:19:01,115
- Stop!
- Why? I'm only a shadow.

254
00:19:01,190 --> 00:19:03,454
Just because you're
a big movie star...

255
00:19:03,525 --> 00:19:07,518
you expect every girl to fall
in a dead faint at your feet!

256
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,188
Well, don't you touch me!

257
00:19:09,264 --> 00:19:11,994
Fear not, sweet lady.
I will not molest you.

258
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,365
I am but a humble jester...

259
00:19:14,436 --> 00:19:17,405
and you are too far above me.

260
00:19:17,472 --> 00:19:19,497
Farewell, Ethel Barrymore.

261
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:22,476
I must tear myself from your side.

262
00:19:34,556 --> 00:19:37,024
- Is this R.F. Simpson's house?
- Yes, miss.

263
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:40,755
- I'm from the Coconut Grove.
- Around the back, please.

264
00:19:40,829 --> 00:19:43,229
I see. Thank you.

265
00:20:06,088 --> 00:20:08,750
- Nice party, R.F.
- Thanks, Roscoe.

266
00:20:08,824 --> 00:20:12,021
Mr. Brown, do you really think
you could get me in the movies?

267
00:20:12,094 --> 00:20:14,153
- I should think so.
- Really?

268
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:18,188
There's Don!
I loved the picture tonight.

269
00:20:18,267 --> 00:20:21,828
- Don, did you come by way of Australia?
- Hello, Cos.

270
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:25,032
Listen, Cos, tell me the truth.
Am I a good actor?

271
00:20:25,107 --> 00:20:27,803
As long as I'm working for Monumental,
you're the greatest.

272
00:20:27,876 --> 00:20:30,504
You're my pal.
You can tell me.

273
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:32,877
What's the matter?
Of course you're good.

274
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,382
Maybe you should tell me
from time to time.

275
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:37,918
- I feel a little shaken.
- The new Don Lockwood.

276
00:20:39,788 --> 00:20:42,450
Where have you been?
We've been waiting for you.

277
00:20:42,524 --> 00:20:45,357
There you are, Donnie.
I was lonely.

278
00:20:45,427 --> 00:20:48,089
- Hello, Lina.
- Okay, fellas, hold it.

279
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:51,690
Together again, like two little stars.
Don and Lina.

280
00:20:51,767 --> 00:20:54,201
No kidding, folks.
Aren't they great?

281
00:20:56,805 --> 00:20:59,603
All right, open that screen.

282
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:03,202
- A movie? We've just seen one.
- Hollywood law says we have to.

283
00:21:03,278 --> 00:21:06,145
I've got a few little
surprises for you tonight.

284
00:21:06,214 --> 00:21:10,446
All right, everyone, sit down.
This will give you a lot of laughs.

285
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:13,920
There's a madman coming into
my office now for months, and...

286
00:21:13,989 --> 00:21:14,022
- Got that gadget working, Sam?
- All set, Mr. Simpson.

287
00:21:14,057 --> 00:21:17,048
- Got that gadget working, Sam?
- All set, Mr. Simpson.

288
00:21:17,125 --> 00:21:19,059
Okay, let her go.

289
00:21:24,933 --> 00:21:26,901
Hello.

290
00:21:26,969 --> 00:21:31,372
This is a demonstration
of a talking picture.

291
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:36,707
Notice, it is a picture of me,
and I am talking.

292
00:21:36,778 --> 00:21:41,078
Note how my lips
and the sound issuing from them...

293
00:21:41,149 --> 00:21:43,743
are synchronized together...

294
00:21:43,819 --> 00:21:46,720
in perfect unison.

295
00:21:46,788 --> 00:21:50,747
- Who's that?
- Somebody's talking behind that screen.

296
00:21:50,826 --> 00:21:54,819
- Come out from there, Mr. Simpson.
- No, I'm right here.

297
00:21:57,766 --> 00:22:01,600
My voice has been
recorded on a record.

298
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:04,298
A talking picture.

299
00:22:04,373 --> 00:22:07,240
Thank you. Good-bye.

300
00:22:10,812 --> 00:22:13,372
- Well?
- It's just a toy.

301
00:22:13,448 --> 00:22:16,440
- It's a scream!
- It's vulgar.

302
00:22:16,518 --> 00:22:18,850
- Think they'll ever use it?
- I doubt it.

303
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,151
The Warner Brothers are making a whole
talking picture, 'The Jazz Singer.'

304
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:24,658
They'll lose their shirts.
What do you think, Dexter?

305
00:22:24,726 --> 00:22:27,923
- It'll never amount to a thing.
- They said that about automobiles.

306
00:22:27,996 --> 00:22:32,433
Let's get on with the show, boys.
Come on, my little starlets.

307
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,299
I have a delicious surprise.
A very special cake.

308
00:22:35,370 --> 00:22:38,134
I want you kiddies
to have the first piece.

309
00:22:43,412 --> 00:22:46,506
Well, if it isn't Ethel Barrymore.

310
00:22:52,254 --> 00:22:54,848
I do hope you're gonna favor us
with something special.

311
00:22:54,923 --> 00:22:57,551
- Please.
- Say Hamlet's soliloquy.

312
00:22:57,626 --> 00:23:00,493
- Or a scene from 'Romeo and Juliet.'
- Mr. Lockwood...

313
00:23:00,562 --> 00:23:04,862
Don't be shy. You'd make about the
prettiest Juliet I've ever seen, really.

314
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:12,106
All I do is dream of you
the whole night through

315
00:23:12,174 --> 00:23:15,075
With the dawn I still go on
dreaming of you

316
00:23:16,111 --> 00:23:18,375
You're every thought
You're everything

317
00:23:18,447 --> 00:23:20,142
You're every song I ever sing

318
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:24,083
Summer, winter, autumn and spring

319
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,179
And were there more
than 24 hours a day

320
00:23:28,256 --> 00:23:32,124
They'd be spent in sweet content
dreaming away

321
00:23:32,194 --> 00:23:34,185
When skies are gray
When skies are blue

322
00:23:34,262 --> 00:23:36,230
Morning, noon and nighttime too

323
00:23:36,298 --> 00:23:40,257
All I do the whole day through
is dream of you

324
00:24:02,591 --> 00:24:04,582
You're the cat's meow!

325
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:11,655
All I do the whole day through
is dream of you

326
00:24:11,733 --> 00:24:14,531
- I have to tell you how good you were.
- Excuse me.

327
00:24:14,603 --> 00:24:18,198
Now that I know where you live,
I'd like to see you home.

328
00:24:18,273 --> 00:24:21,868
- Listen, Mr. Lockwood...
- Say! Who is this dame?

329
00:24:21,943 --> 00:24:24,935
Oh, someone lofty
and far above us all.

330
00:24:25,013 --> 00:24:27,277
She couldn't learn
anything from the movies.

331
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:29,544
She's an actress
on the legitimate stage.

332
00:24:29,618 --> 00:24:31,882
Here's one thing
I've learned from the movies!

333
00:24:37,092 --> 00:24:39,925
Lina, she was aiming at me!

334
00:24:39,995 --> 00:24:42,828
- You've never looked lovelier.
- It was just an accident.

335
00:24:42,898 --> 00:24:45,196
It happens to me
five or six times a day.

336
00:24:45,267 --> 00:24:47,201
Where is she?

337
00:24:47,269 --> 00:24:48,930
Donnie?

338
00:24:51,006 --> 00:24:53,531
Excuse me.
Where'd Miss Selden go?

339
00:24:53,608 --> 00:24:57,339
She just grabbed her things and vaulted.
Anything I can do?

340
00:24:57,412 --> 00:24:59,972
Sorry. I don't have time
to find out.

341
00:25:35,584 --> 00:25:38,451
Keep that action going.
Let's have more steam in the kettle.

342
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:42,889
A little more action, boys.
More steam and water in that kettle.

343
00:25:45,694 --> 00:25:49,596
- Good morning, fellas.
- Did you read 'Variety' today?

344
00:25:49,664 --> 00:25:53,532
'First talking picture, The Jazz Singer,
all-time smash by end of first week.'

345
00:25:53,602 --> 00:25:56,799
- All-time flop by end of the second.
- We start today.

346
00:25:56,871 --> 00:25:58,168
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

347
00:25:58,240 --> 00:26:01,607
I am now Count Pierre de Battaille,
better known as the Dueling Cavalier.

348
00:26:01,676 --> 00:26:04,702
- What's this one about?
- It's a French Revolution story.

349
00:26:04,779 --> 00:26:08,146
You're a French aristocrat,
and she's a simple girl of the people...

350
00:26:08,216 --> 00:26:10,343
and she won't even
give you a tumble.

351
00:26:10,418 --> 00:26:13,046
Well, it's a living.

352
00:26:15,190 --> 00:26:17,681
Hit him. Hit him.

353
00:26:17,759 --> 00:26:21,627
Knock him down.
Get up there and hit him again.

354
00:26:21,696 --> 00:26:25,154
Why bother to shoot this picture?
Release the old one under a new title.

355
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:27,793
If you've seen one,
you've seen them all.

356
00:26:27,869 --> 00:26:29,962
- What'd you say that for?
- What's the matter?

357
00:26:30,038 --> 00:26:32,905
That's what that Kathy Selden
said to me that night.

358
00:26:32,974 --> 00:26:36,501
That's three weeks ago.
Are you still thinking about that?

359
00:26:36,578 --> 00:26:40,480
- Well, I can't get her out of my mind.
- How could you?

360
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,779
She's the first dame who hasn't fallen
for your line since you were four.

361
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:47,379
- I guess she's on my conscience.
- It's not your fault she lost her job.

362
00:26:47,455 --> 00:26:49,923
- I've got to find her.
- You've been trying to...

363
00:26:49,991 --> 00:26:52,459
short of sending out
bloodhounds and a posse.

364
00:26:52,527 --> 00:26:56,224
Snap out of it. Don't let
a little thing get you down.

365
00:26:56,298 --> 00:27:00,098
You're Don Lockwood, aren't you?
Donald Lockwood's an actor, isn't he?

366
00:27:00,168 --> 00:27:03,399
What's the first thing an actor learns?
The show must go on!

367
00:27:03,471 --> 00:27:07,532
Come rain, come shine, come snow,
come sleet, the show must go on!

368
00:27:07,609 --> 00:27:10,203
Ridi, Pagliacci, ridi.

369
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,805
The world's so full
of a number of things.

370
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:17,374
I'm sure we should all
be as happy as...

371
00:27:17,452 --> 00:27:20,353
But are we? No.
Definitely no.

372
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,413
Positively no!
Decidedly no!

373
00:27:25,694 --> 00:27:29,687
Short people have long faces,
and long people have short faces.

374
00:27:29,764 --> 00:27:32,358
Big people have little humor,
and little people have no humor at all.

375
00:27:34,302 --> 00:27:37,703
And in the words of that immortal bard,
Samuel J. Snodgrass...

376
00:27:37,772 --> 00:27:40,241
as he was about to be led
to the guillotine...

377
00:27:40,276 --> 00:27:41,071
as he was about to be led
to the guillotine...

378
00:27:41,142 --> 00:27:44,043
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

379
00:27:44,112 --> 00:27:47,479
Don't you know
everyone wants to laugh

380
00:27:47,549 --> 00:27:50,814
My dad said
Be an actor, my son

381
00:27:50,885 --> 00:27:53,217
But be a comical one

382
00:27:53,288 --> 00:27:56,223
They'll be standin' in lines

383
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:59,658
For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines

384
00:27:59,728 --> 00:28:02,629
Now you could study Shakespeare
and be quite elite

385
00:28:02,697 --> 00:28:05,598
And you could charm the critics
and have nothing to eat

386
00:28:05,667 --> 00:28:08,636
Just slip on a banana peel
The world's at your feet

387
00:28:08,703 --> 00:28:11,672
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh
make 'em laugh

388
00:28:13,108 --> 00:28:14,541
Make 'em laugh

389
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:18,067
Don't you know
everyone wants to laugh

390
00:28:18,146 --> 00:28:21,604
My grandpa said
Go out and tell 'em a joke

391
00:28:21,683 --> 00:28:24,151
But give it plenty of hoke

392
00:28:24,219 --> 00:28:26,915
Make 'em roar
make 'em scream

393
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:30,355
Take a fall, butt a wall
split a seam

394
00:28:30,425 --> 00:28:33,360
You start off by pretending
you're a dancer with grace

395
00:28:33,428 --> 00:28:36,397
You wiggle 'til they're giggling
all over the place

396
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,297
And then you get
a great big custard pie in the face

397
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:42,427
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh
make 'em laugh

398
00:28:43,905 --> 00:28:45,429
Make 'em laugh

399
00:28:45,507 --> 00:28:47,441
Don't you... All the...

400
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,744
My dad...

401
00:28:54,582 --> 00:28:57,642
They'll be standin' in lines

402
00:28:57,719 --> 00:29:01,086
For those old
honky-tonk monkeyshines

403
00:30:13,628 --> 00:30:16,961
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

404
00:30:17,031 --> 00:30:19,261
Don't you know everyone...

405
00:30:29,344 --> 00:30:31,539
Make 'em laugh

406
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:35,515
Make 'em laugh

407
00:30:37,585 --> 00:30:39,519
Make 'em laugh

408
00:30:42,891 --> 00:30:46,054
Make 'em laugh, make 'em laugh

409
00:30:46,127 --> 00:30:49,654
Make 'em laugh

410
00:30:55,470 --> 00:30:57,495
- Ready, Don?
- All set, Roscoe.

411
00:30:57,572 --> 00:31:00,507
Here we go again. I think we have
another smash on our hands.

412
00:31:00,575 --> 00:31:02,941
- I hope so.
- You're darn tootin' we have.

413
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:05,002
- Where's Lina?
- Here she is.

414
00:31:05,079 --> 00:31:08,742
Well, well, here comes
our lovely leading lady now.

415
00:31:08,816 --> 00:31:12,252
This wig weighs a ton.
What dope would wear a thing like this?

416
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:15,448
- Everybody used to wear them.
- Then everybody was a dope.

417
00:31:15,523 --> 00:31:17,115
Honey, you look beautiful.

418
00:31:17,191 --> 00:31:19,682
Yes, you look great.
Let's get into the set.

419
00:31:20,595 --> 00:31:21,527
Thanks, Joe.

420
00:31:21,596 --> 00:31:24,121
I looked for you the other night
at Wally Ray's party.

421
00:31:24,198 --> 00:31:27,326
- Where were you?
- I've been busy.

422
00:31:27,402 --> 00:31:30,565
And I know what you've been busy at...
lookin' for that girl.

423
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:33,106
- As a matter of fact, yes.
- Why?

424
00:31:33,174 --> 00:31:36,769
- I've been worried about her.
- You should've been worried about me.

425
00:31:36,844 --> 00:31:39,870
After all, I'm the one who got
the whipped cream in the kisser.

426
00:31:39,948 --> 00:31:42,473
But you didn't lose your job,
and she did.

427
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:45,576
You're darn tootin' she did.
I arranged it.

428
00:31:45,653 --> 00:31:46,915
What?

429
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:50,583
They weren't gonna fire her, so I called
them and told them they'd better.

430
00:31:50,658 --> 00:31:52,319
Okay, Don, remember.

431
00:31:52,393 --> 00:31:56,295
You're madly in love with her, and you
must overcome her shyness and timidity.

432
00:31:56,364 --> 00:31:58,832
Cosmo, mood music.

433
00:32:01,069 --> 00:32:02,593
Roll 'em!

434
00:32:03,972 --> 00:32:06,497
Okay, Don.
Now enter.

435
00:32:08,076 --> 00:32:10,874
You see her.
Run to her!

436
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:19,518
Why, you rattlesnake, you.
You got that poor kid fired.

437
00:32:19,587 --> 00:32:23,921
That's not all I'm gonna do
if I ever get my hands on her.

438
00:32:23,992 --> 00:32:26,392
I never heard of anything so low.

439
00:32:26,461 --> 00:32:28,053
Fine. Looks great.

440
00:32:28,129 --> 00:32:30,620
What did you do it for?

441
00:32:30,698 --> 00:32:33,826
'Cause you liked her.
I could tell.

442
00:32:33,901 --> 00:32:35,562
So that's it.

443
00:32:35,637 --> 00:32:40,006
Believe me, I don't like her
half as much as I hate you.

444
00:32:40,074 --> 00:32:41,803
You reptile.

445
00:32:41,876 --> 00:32:44,811
Sticks and stones may break my bones...

446
00:32:44,879 --> 00:32:47,074
I'd like to break
every bone in your body.

447
00:32:47,148 --> 00:32:49,446
You and who else, you big lummox?

448
00:32:49,517 --> 00:32:51,109
Kiss her, Don.

449
00:32:53,021 --> 00:32:54,989
That's it! More!

450
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,990
Great! Cut!

451
00:32:58,526 --> 00:33:02,724
You couldn't kiss me like that
and not mean it just a teensy bit.

452
00:33:02,797 --> 00:33:06,164
Meet the greatest actor in the world.
I'd rather kiss a tarantula!

453
00:33:06,234 --> 00:33:08,293
- You don't mean that.
- I don't...

454
00:33:08,369 --> 00:33:10,735
Joe, bring me a tarantula.
Listen, Lina...

455
00:33:10,805 --> 00:33:13,740
Stop that chitchat, you lovebirds.
Let's get another take.

456
00:33:13,808 --> 00:33:14,740
Hold it!

457
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,743
- Hold it!
- Hello, Mr. Simpson.

458
00:33:16,811 --> 00:33:19,609
- We're really rolling.
- Stop rolling at once.

459
00:33:20,848 --> 00:33:22,577
All right, everybody, save it!

460
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:25,118
Tell them to go home.
We're shutting down for a few weeks.

461
00:33:25,186 --> 00:33:27,484
- What?
- Don't just stand there, tell them!

462
00:33:27,555 --> 00:33:30,183
Everybody go home until further notice!
What is this?

463
00:33:30,258 --> 00:33:33,625
- What's the matter, R.F.?
- 'The Jazz Singer,' that's what.

464
00:33:33,695 --> 00:33:37,290
My darlin' little mammy
down in Alabamy

465
00:33:37,365 --> 00:33:40,801
This is no joke, Cosmo.
The public is screaming for more.

466
00:33:40,868 --> 00:33:43,530
- More what?
- Talking pictures!

467
00:33:43,604 --> 00:33:46,767
- It's just a freak.
- We should have such a freak here.

468
00:33:46,841 --> 00:33:50,004
I told you talking pictures were
a menace, but no one would listen to me.

469
00:33:50,078 --> 00:33:52,012
Don, we're going to put
our best feet forward.

470
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:54,844
We're going to make 'The Dueling
Cavalier' into a talking picture.

471
00:33:54,916 --> 00:33:58,943
That means I'm out of a job. I can start
suffering and write that symphony.

472
00:33:59,020 --> 00:34:01,955
We're putting you in as
head of the new music department.

473
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:05,083
Thanks, R.F.! I can stop suffering
and write that symphony.

474
00:34:05,159 --> 00:34:08,322
Wait a second, Mr. Simpson.
I think you should wait...

475
00:34:08,396 --> 00:34:10,523
Every studio
is jumping on the bandwagon.

476
00:34:10,598 --> 00:34:13,362
Theaters are putting in sound equipment.
We don't want to be left out.

477
00:34:13,434 --> 00:34:16,767
- We know nothing about this gadget.
- What do you have to know?

478
00:34:16,838 --> 00:34:19,534
You do what you always did.
You just add talking to it.

479
00:34:19,607 --> 00:34:22,310
- Yeah?
- Believe me, it will be a sensation.

480
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:22,435
- Yeah?
- Believe me, it will be a sensation.

481
00:34:22,510 --> 00:34:25,604
'Lamont And Lockwood: They Talk.'

482
00:34:25,680 --> 00:34:28,843
Well, of course we talk.
Don't everybody?

483
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:48,059
I got a feelin' you're foolin'

484
00:34:48,136 --> 00:34:50,070
I got a feelin' you're havin' fun

485
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:53,039
I'll get the go-by when you are done
foolin' with me

486
00:34:53,107 --> 00:34:56,634
It's a holiday, today's the wedding
of the painted doll

487
00:34:56,711 --> 00:34:58,645
It's a jolly day
The news is spreading

488
00:34:58,713 --> 00:35:02,547
Should I reveal exactly how I feel

489
00:35:02,617 --> 00:35:04,778
Should I confess

490
00:35:28,309 --> 00:35:32,109
Beautiful girl
You're a lovely picture

491
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,775
Beautiful girl
You're a gorgeous picture

492
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:40,310
Of all that lies
under the big blue skies

493
00:35:41,255 --> 00:35:43,189
My heart cries

494
00:35:43,257 --> 00:35:45,191
That girl on his right
looks familiar.

495
00:35:45,259 --> 00:35:47,090
You're a dazzling eyeful

496
00:35:47,161 --> 00:35:50,824
- I've featured her in nightclub shows.
- That's probably where I've seen her.

497
00:35:50,898 --> 00:35:53,025
She'd be good in the part
of Zelda's kid sister.

498
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,762
- That's a good idea.
- Excuse me.

499
00:35:56,904 --> 00:35:59,839
There may be blondes and brunettes

500
00:35:59,907 --> 00:36:01,966
That are hard to resist

501
00:36:02,043 --> 00:36:04,773
You surpass them like a queen

502
00:36:05,847 --> 00:36:09,544
You've got those lips
that were meant to be kissed

503
00:36:09,617 --> 00:36:12,450
And you're over sweet 16

504
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:17,253
Oh, beautiful girl
What a gorgeous creature

505
00:36:17,325 --> 00:36:21,056
Beautiful girl
Let me call a preacher

506
00:36:21,128 --> 00:36:23,062
What can I do

507
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:27,157
But give my heart to you

508
00:36:29,170 --> 00:36:33,971
A beautiful girl
is like a great work of art.

509
00:36:34,041 --> 00:36:36,032
She's stylish.

510
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:37,805
She's chic.

511
00:36:37,879 --> 00:36:42,441
And she also is smart

512
00:36:44,385 --> 00:36:47,286
For lounging in her boudoir...

513
00:36:47,355 --> 00:36:50,119
this simple, plain pajama.

514
00:36:51,425 --> 00:36:54,690
Her cloak is trimmed
with monkey fur...

515
00:36:54,762 --> 00:36:57,128
to lend a dash of drama.

516
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:00,126
Anyone for tennis?

517
00:37:00,201 --> 00:37:03,170
Well, this will make them cringe.

518
00:37:04,906 --> 00:37:07,136
And you'll knock 'em dead at dinner...

519
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:10,473
if your gown just drips with fringe.

520
00:37:12,013 --> 00:37:14,709
You simply can't be too modest...

521
00:37:14,782 --> 00:37:17,376
at the beach or by the pool.

522
00:37:18,219 --> 00:37:21,279
And in summertime it's organdy...

523
00:37:21,355 --> 00:37:24,119
that'll keep you fresh and cool.

524
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,719
You'd never guess what loud applause...

525
00:37:27,795 --> 00:37:30,389
this cunning hat receives.

526
00:37:31,599 --> 00:37:35,535
And you'd never dream
the things that you could hide...

527
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:38,231
within these sleeves.

528
00:37:38,306 --> 00:37:41,571
A string of pearls
with a suit of tweed.

529
00:37:41,642 --> 00:37:44,042
It started quite a riot.

530
00:37:45,146 --> 00:37:48,081
And if you must wear fox
to the opera...

531
00:37:48,149 --> 00:37:50,947
Dame Fashion says, 'Dye it.'

532
00:37:51,919 --> 00:37:54,820
Black is best when you're in court.

533
00:37:54,889 --> 00:37:59,326
The judge will be impressed

534
00:37:59,393 --> 00:38:03,921
But white is right
when you're a bride

535
00:38:03,998 --> 00:38:09,163
And you want to be well-dressed

536
00:38:11,472 --> 00:38:15,135
Beautiful girl

537
00:38:15,209 --> 00:38:17,837
For you I've got a passion

538
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:21,678
Beautiful girl

539
00:38:21,749 --> 00:38:24,513
You're my queen of fashion

540
00:38:24,585 --> 00:38:27,884
I'm in a whirl

541
00:38:28,889 --> 00:38:34,885
Over my beautiful

542
00:38:34,962 --> 00:38:39,956
Girl

543
00:38:45,172 --> 00:38:47,106
- That's stupendous!
- Thanks.

544
00:38:47,174 --> 00:38:50,405
- Kathy, come here.
- This'll start a new trend in musicals.

545
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:53,743
Kathy, Mr. Simpson is thinking of
casting you as Zelda's kid sister.

546
00:38:53,814 --> 00:38:55,805
That's wonderful, Mr. Simpson.

547
00:38:56,884 --> 00:39:00,183
- That's Kathy Selden!
- Thanks anyway.

548
00:39:00,254 --> 00:39:02,347
- Wait a minute.
- That's all right.

549
00:39:02,423 --> 00:39:05,483
Before Mr. Lockwood reminds you,
you might as well know...

550
00:39:05,559 --> 00:39:07,789
I'm the girl who hit
Miss Lamont with a cake.

551
00:39:07,862 --> 00:39:10,660
Believe me,
it was meant for Mr. Lockwood!

552
00:39:10,731 --> 00:39:12,995
Good-bye, Sid.
I should have told you.

553
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:15,331
Wait a minute.
What's this about, R.F.?

554
00:39:15,403 --> 00:39:18,839
We wanted to use her in Zelda's picture,
but if it made you and Lina unhappy...

555
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:20,840
I think it's wonderful.

556
00:39:20,908 --> 00:39:24,105
- He's been looking for her for weeks.
- Are you speaking for Lina also?

557
00:39:24,178 --> 00:39:27,477
R.F., the owner of the Coconut Grove
may do what Lina tells him to...

558
00:39:27,548 --> 00:39:30,517
- but you're the head of this studio.
- Yes, I am.

559
00:39:30,584 --> 00:39:33,553
She's hired. But don't let
Lina know she's on the lot.

560
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,021
- Take care of that, Phillips.
- Thank you!

561
00:39:36,090 --> 00:39:39,617
I'm glad you turned up.
We've looked inside every cake in town.

562
00:39:41,495 --> 00:39:43,759
Is it all right for you
to be seen with me?

563
00:39:43,831 --> 00:39:46,561
You mean, lofty star
with humble player?

564
00:39:46,634 --> 00:39:51,128
Not exactly, but for lunch, don't you
usually tear a pheasant with Lamont?

565
00:39:51,205 --> 00:39:55,437
Look, Kathy, all that stuff about
Lina and me is sheer publicity.

566
00:39:55,509 --> 00:39:58,307
Oh? It certainly seems
more than that.

567
00:39:58,379 --> 00:40:01,576
From what I've read in the columns
and the fan magazines...

568
00:40:02,983 --> 00:40:06,612
You read the fan magazines.

569
00:40:06,687 --> 00:40:09,747
I pick them up in the beauty parlor
or the dentist's office...

570
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:11,758
just like anybody.

571
00:40:11,826 --> 00:40:13,384
Honest?

572
00:40:15,029 --> 00:40:18,328
- Well, I buy four or five a month.
- You buy four or five?

573
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:21,765
Anyway, to get back
to the main point...

574
00:40:21,836 --> 00:40:24,737
you and Miss Lamont do achieve
an intimacy in all your pictures...

575
00:40:24,805 --> 00:40:27,330
Did you say all my pictures?

576
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,941
I guess now that I think of it,
I've seen eight or nine of them.

577
00:40:33,013 --> 00:40:37,109
Eight or nine. It seems to me
I remember someone saying...

578
00:40:37,184 --> 00:40:40,119
'If you've seen one,
you've seen 'em all.'

579
00:40:42,022 --> 00:40:45,549
I did say some awful things
that night, didn't I?

580
00:40:45,626 --> 00:40:48,254
No. I deserved them.

581
00:40:48,329 --> 00:40:52,390
Of course, I must admit
I was pretty much upset by them.

582
00:40:52,466 --> 00:40:56,800
So upset that I haven't been able
to think of anything but you ever since.

583
00:40:58,405 --> 00:40:59,895
Honest?

584
00:41:00,975 --> 00:41:02,408
Honest.

585
00:41:03,978 --> 00:41:07,072
Well, I've been pretty upset too.

586
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:10,616
Kathy, look.

587
00:41:10,684 --> 00:41:13,244
Seeing you again,
now that I...

588
00:41:17,258 --> 00:41:20,455
Kathy, I'm trying to say
something to you, but I...

589
00:41:20,528 --> 00:41:22,291
I'm such a ham.

590
00:41:22,363 --> 00:41:25,196
I guess I'm not able to
without the proper setting.

591
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:27,700
- What do you mean?
- Well...

592
00:41:29,069 --> 00:41:30,661
Come here.

593
00:41:38,812 --> 00:41:40,871
This is the proper setting.

594
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,850
Why, it's just an empty stage.

595
00:41:43,918 --> 00:41:47,115
At first glance, yes.
But wait a second.

596
00:41:49,323 --> 00:41:51,484
A beautiful sunset.

597
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:57,325
Mist from the distant mountains.

598
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,866
Colored lights in a garden.

599
00:42:04,104 --> 00:42:06,698
Milady is standing on her balcony...

600
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,004
in a rose-trellised bower...

601
00:42:12,913 --> 00:42:14,881
flooded with moonlight.

602
00:42:14,949 --> 00:42:18,385
We add 500,000 kilowatts
of stardust...

603
00:42:21,422 --> 00:42:23,913
a soft summer breeze...

604
00:42:25,359 --> 00:42:26,621
and...

605
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:30,096
You sure look lovely
in the moonlight, Kathy.

606
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:35,568
Now that you have the proper setting,
can you say it?

607
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:38,737
I'll try.

608
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:43,003
Life was a song

609
00:42:43,077 --> 00:42:46,478
You came along

610
00:42:46,547 --> 00:42:51,985
I've laid awake
the whole night through

611
00:42:53,053 --> 00:42:56,216
If I but dared

612
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,259
To think you cared

613
00:42:59,326 --> 00:43:05,322
This is what I'd say to you

614
00:43:08,669 --> 00:43:14,073
You were meant for me

615
00:43:16,810 --> 00:43:22,271
And I was meant for you

616
00:43:25,019 --> 00:43:28,750
Nature patterned you

617
00:43:28,822 --> 00:43:33,054
And when she was done

618
00:43:33,127 --> 00:43:37,496
You were all the sweet things

619
00:43:37,564 --> 00:43:40,931
Rolled up in one

620
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:47,197
You're like a plaintive melody

621
00:43:50,778 --> 00:43:56,774
That never lets me free

622
00:43:59,286 --> 00:44:03,313
But I'm content

623
00:44:03,390 --> 00:44:08,089
The angels must have sent you

624
00:44:08,162 --> 00:44:12,929
And they meant you

625
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:16,401
Just for me

626
00:45:43,056 --> 00:45:46,958
But I'm content

627
00:45:48,262 --> 00:45:53,029
The angels must have sent you

628
00:45:53,967 --> 00:45:59,530
And they meant you

629
00:46:00,441 --> 00:46:05,105
Just for me

630
00:46:24,131 --> 00:46:25,564
Now...

631
00:46:25,632 --> 00:46:29,625
ta, te, ti, to, tu.

632
00:46:31,438 --> 00:46:35,807
Ta, tay, tee, toe, too.

633
00:46:35,876 --> 00:46:40,711
No, no, Miss Lamont.
Round tones, round tones.

634
00:46:40,781 --> 00:46:43,375
Now let me hear you read your line.

635
00:46:44,818 --> 00:46:47,548
And I can't stand 'im.

636
00:46:47,621 --> 00:46:49,885
And I can't stand him.

637
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:53,158
And I can't stand 'im.

638
00:46:54,261 --> 00:46:55,853
Can't.

639
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:57,988
Can't.

640
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,362
'Cahn't.'

641
00:47:00,367 --> 00:47:01,994
'Can-t.'

642
00:47:02,803 --> 00:47:05,294
Can't. Can't.

643
00:47:05,372 --> 00:47:06,805
Very good. Now...

644
00:47:06,874 --> 00:47:10,207
Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran.

645
00:47:10,277 --> 00:47:14,577
- Around the rocks the rugged...
- No, rocks, rocks.

646
00:47:14,648 --> 00:47:17,446
Around the rocks the rugged rascal ran.

647
00:47:19,286 --> 00:47:20,844
- Shall I continue?
- Go ahead.

648
00:47:20,921 --> 00:47:22,354
Don't mind me.

649
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:25,186
Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter...

650
00:47:25,259 --> 00:47:28,319
seized his knees and sneezed.

651
00:47:28,395 --> 00:47:32,058
- Sinful Caesar snipped his sifter...
- No, sipped his snifter.

652
00:47:32,132 --> 00:47:35,624
- Sipped his snifter.
- Oh, thank you.

653
00:47:35,702 --> 00:47:40,071
Sinful Caesar sipped his snifter,
seized his knees and sneezed.

654
00:47:40,140 --> 00:47:42,074
- Marvelous.
- Wonderful.

655
00:47:42,142 --> 00:47:44,076
Oh, here is a good one.

656
00:47:44,144 --> 00:47:47,875
Chester chooses chestnuts,
cheddar cheese with chewy chives.

657
00:47:47,948 --> 00:47:50,143
He chews them and he chooses them.

658
00:47:50,217 --> 00:47:53,448
He chooses them and he chews them,
those chestnuts...

659
00:47:53,520 --> 00:47:57,513
cheddar cheese and chives
in cheery, charming chunks.

660
00:47:57,591 --> 00:48:00,754
- Wonderful! Do another one.
- Thank you.

661
00:48:00,827 --> 00:48:04,319
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

662
00:48:04,398 --> 00:48:07,162
but Moses supposes erroneously.

663
00:48:07,234 --> 00:48:10,032
Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses...

664
00:48:10,103 --> 00:48:13,766
as Moses supposes his toeses to be.

665
00:48:16,610 --> 00:48:19,306
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

666
00:48:19,379 --> 00:48:21,847
but Moses supposes erroneously.

667
00:48:21,915 --> 00:48:25,146
But Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses...

668
00:48:25,218 --> 00:48:27,914
as Moses supposes his toeses to be.

669
00:48:27,988 --> 00:48:30,548
Moses supposes his toeses are roses...

670
00:48:30,624 --> 00:48:33,184
but Moses supposes erroneously.

671
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,820
- A Mose is a Mose.
- A rose is a rose.

672
00:48:35,896 --> 00:48:37,659
A toes is a toes.

673
00:48:38,732 --> 00:48:41,462
Moses supposes his toeses are roses

674
00:48:41,535 --> 00:48:44,265
But Moses supposes erroneously

675
00:48:44,338 --> 00:48:47,068
For Moses, he knowses
his toeses aren't roses

676
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,041
As Moses supposes his toeses to be

677
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:52,738
- Moses
- He supposes his toeses are roses

678
00:48:52,813 --> 00:48:55,111
- Moses
- But Moses supposes erroneously

679
00:48:55,182 --> 00:48:58,151
- Eenie meenie minie Moses
- He knowses his toeses aren't roses

680
00:48:58,218 --> 00:49:01,016
As Moses supposes his toeses to be

681
00:49:01,088 --> 00:49:03,818
A rose is a rose is a rose
is a rose is

682
00:49:03,890 --> 00:49:06,586
A rose is what Moses
supposes his toes is

683
00:49:06,660 --> 00:49:09,322
Couldn't be a lily
or a taffy-daffy-dilly

684
00:49:09,396 --> 00:49:12,126
It's gotta be a rose
'cause it rhymes with Mose

685
00:51:25,866 --> 00:51:27,959
All right, here we go.

686
00:51:28,034 --> 00:51:30,025
- Quiet!
- Quiet!

687
00:51:30,103 --> 00:51:31,570
Roll 'em!

688
00:51:34,474 --> 00:51:37,500
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't...

689
00:51:37,577 --> 00:51:41,104
She's gotta talk into the mike.
I can't pick it up.

690
00:51:42,482 --> 00:51:43,847
Cut!

691
00:51:43,917 --> 00:51:46,477
- What's the matter, Dexter?
- It's Lina.

692
00:51:46,553 --> 00:51:49,954
Look, Lina, don't you remember?
I told you.

693
00:51:50,023 --> 00:51:54,460
There's a microphone right there
in the bush.

694
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:57,622
- Yeah.
- You have to talk into it.

695
00:51:57,697 --> 00:52:00,029
I was talking,
wasn't I, Miss Dinsmore?

696
00:52:00,100 --> 00:52:04,560
Yes, my dear, but please remember:
round tones.

697
00:52:04,638 --> 00:52:07,937
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

698
00:52:08,008 --> 00:52:10,568
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

699
00:52:10,644 --> 00:52:13,807
- Yes, that's much better.
- Hold it a second!

700
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:15,745
Now, Lina, look.

701
00:52:15,816 --> 00:52:19,616
Here's the mike,
right here in the bush.

702
00:52:19,686 --> 00:52:22,091
- Yeah.
- Now you talk towards it.

703
00:52:22,802 --> 00:52:25,930
The sound goes
through the cable to the box.

704
00:52:26,005 --> 00:52:29,771
A man records it
on a big record in wax.

705
00:52:29,842 --> 00:52:33,676
But you have to talk
into the mike first...

706
00:52:33,746 --> 00:52:35,236
in the bush!

707
00:52:35,315 --> 00:52:36,805
Now try it again.

708
00:52:36,883 --> 00:52:39,283
- Gee, this is dumb.
- She'll get it, Dexter.

709
00:52:39,352 --> 00:52:42,253
Lina, don't worry. We're all
a little nervous the first day.

710
00:52:42,322 --> 00:52:44,256
Everything's gonna be okay.

711
00:52:44,324 --> 00:52:48,658
Roscoe, you know the scene where I say,
'Imperious Princess of the night'?

712
00:52:48,728 --> 00:52:52,459
I don't like those lines there.
Is it okay if I say what I always do?

713
00:52:52,532 --> 00:52:55,194
'I love you, I love you, I love you'?

714
00:52:55,268 --> 00:52:57,668
Sure. Any way it's comfortable.

715
00:52:57,737 --> 00:52:59,602
But into the bush!

716
00:52:59,672 --> 00:53:02,766
Okay, again! Quiet!

717
00:53:02,842 --> 00:53:05,276
- Quiet!
- Roll 'em!

718
00:53:08,081 --> 00:53:10,982
...you shouldn't have...

719
00:53:11,050 --> 00:53:14,679
...flirting with danger.
...surely find you out.

720
00:53:17,490 --> 00:53:21,290
Cut! Lina, we're missing
every other word.

721
00:53:21,361 --> 00:53:23,795
You've got to talk into the mike!

722
00:53:23,863 --> 00:53:26,525
Well, I can't make love to a bush!

723
00:53:26,599 --> 00:53:29,159
All right, all right.

724
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:32,170
We'll have to think
of something else.

725
00:53:38,077 --> 00:53:39,738
What are you doing?

726
00:53:39,812 --> 00:53:42,440
- You're being wired for sound.
- What?

727
00:53:42,515 --> 00:53:46,349
Watch out for those dentalized
D's and T's and those flat A's.

728
00:53:46,419 --> 00:53:48,785
Everybody's picking on me!

729
00:53:48,855 --> 00:53:52,450
Okay, Lina,
now look at this flower. See?

730
00:53:52,525 --> 00:53:54,925
The mike is in there.

731
00:53:54,994 --> 00:53:56,518
That's it.

732
00:53:56,596 --> 00:53:59,690
Now the sound will run from it...

733
00:53:59,766 --> 00:54:02,530
through this wire onto the record.

734
00:54:02,602 --> 00:54:04,797
It'll catch whatever you say.

735
00:54:04,871 --> 00:54:08,432
Now, let's hear how it sounds, Lina.

736
00:54:08,508 --> 00:54:10,237
Okay, quiet!

737
00:54:10,309 --> 00:54:12,402
- Quiet!
- Roll 'em!

738
00:54:15,214 --> 00:54:18,445
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have come.

739
00:54:18,518 --> 00:54:22,249
You're flirting with danger.
They will surely...

740
00:54:22,321 --> 00:54:25,449
- What's that noise?
- The mike's picking up her heartbeat.

741
00:54:25,525 --> 00:54:27,015
Swell.

742
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,222
Cut!

743
00:54:33,299 --> 00:54:35,733
That's right.
That should do it.

744
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:39,636
Now don't forget, Lina,
the mike is on your shoulder...

745
00:54:39,705 --> 00:54:43,402
and whatever you say goes
through the wire onto the record.

746
00:54:43,476 --> 00:54:46,707
- Now please, Lina, talk into the mike.
- Yeah.

747
00:54:46,779 --> 00:54:50,340
Don't make any quick, jerky movements
or you might disconnect it.

748
00:54:50,416 --> 00:54:52,714
Okay, let's go.
Quiet.

749
00:54:52,785 --> 00:54:54,150
Quiet!

750
00:54:54,220 --> 00:54:55,653
Roll 'em!

751
00:54:59,158 --> 00:55:03,424
Pierre, you shouldn't have come.
You're flirting with danger.

752
00:55:03,496 --> 00:55:05,794
What's this wire doing here?
It's dangerous.

753
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:22,274
You two shouldn't go
into the theater together.

754
00:55:22,348 --> 00:55:25,317
Lina's probably waiting
right inside the door.

755
00:55:25,384 --> 00:55:27,614
- How I wish...
- Don't worry.

756
00:55:27,687 --> 00:55:30,622
I'll be leading the cheering section
in the balcony. Good luck.

757
00:56:06,325 --> 00:56:08,725
What's that,
the thunderstorm outside?

758
00:56:08,794 --> 00:56:10,762
It's those pearls, Mr. Simpson.

759
00:56:16,435 --> 00:56:20,929
I am the noblest lady of the court,
second only to the queen...

760
00:56:21,007 --> 00:56:24,238
yet I am the saddest
of the mortals in France.

761
00:56:24,310 --> 00:56:26,972
What is the matter, my lady?

762
00:56:27,046 --> 00:56:29,412
I'm so downhearted, Theresa.

763
00:56:29,482 --> 00:56:32,883
My father has me betrothed
to the Baron de Landsfield...

764
00:56:32,952 --> 00:56:34,647
and I can't stand 'im.

765
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:37,518
But he is such a catch.

766
00:56:37,590 --> 00:56:41,287
All the ladies of the court wish
they were in your pretty shoes.

767
00:56:41,360 --> 00:56:43,692
My heart belongs to another.

768
00:56:44,697 --> 00:56:46,722
Pierre de Battaille.

769
00:56:46,799 --> 00:56:50,792
Ever since I met him,
I can't get 'im outta my mind.

770
00:56:50,870 --> 00:56:52,804
Sounds good and loud, huh?

771
00:57:01,714 --> 00:57:05,275
Oh, Pierre, you shouldn't have...

772
00:57:05,351 --> 00:57:07,683
You're flirting with danger.

773
00:57:07,753 --> 00:57:11,450
They will surely...

774
00:57:11,524 --> 00:57:13,014
...too valuable.

775
00:57:13,092 --> 00:57:16,459
She never could remember
where the microphone was, boss.

776
00:57:16,529 --> 00:57:20,397
'Tis Cupid himself
that called me here, and I...

777
00:57:20,466 --> 00:57:23,026
smitten by his arrow...

778
00:57:29,408 --> 00:57:32,434
The night is full of our enemies.

779
00:57:35,881 --> 00:57:38,372
Hey, Lina, whatcha hittin' him with,
a blackjack?

780
00:57:41,988 --> 00:57:43,216
I love you.

781
00:57:45,391 --> 00:57:47,120
I love you.

782
00:57:51,530 --> 00:57:55,364
I love you. I love you.
I love you. I love you.

783
00:57:57,737 --> 00:58:00,171
Did somebody get paid
for writing that dialogue?

784
00:58:03,009 --> 00:58:04,943
Sounds like a comedy inside.

785
00:58:05,011 --> 00:58:07,673
- It's a Lockwood-Lamont talkie.
- What?

786
00:58:07,747 --> 00:58:09,180
This is terrible.

787
00:58:16,289 --> 00:58:17,586
What's that?

788
00:58:17,657 --> 00:58:19,921
The sound.
It's out of synchronization!

789
00:58:19,992 --> 00:58:22,085
- Tell them to fix it!
- Yes, sir.

790
00:58:23,262 --> 00:58:25,127
What's this?

791
00:58:25,197 --> 00:58:29,657
Yvonne, captured by Rouge Noir
of the Purple Terror?

792
00:58:29,735 --> 00:58:32,499
Oh! Oh, my sword!

793
00:58:32,571 --> 00:58:34,539
I must fly to her side.

794
00:58:35,341 --> 00:58:38,708
Yvonne, Yvonne, my own!

795
00:58:39,912 --> 00:58:43,245
Pierre will save me! Pierre!

796
00:58:43,316 --> 00:58:46,410
Pierre is miles away, you wench!

797
00:58:46,485 --> 00:58:48,885
No, no, no!

798
00:58:48,954 --> 00:58:51,184
Yes, yes, yes!

799
00:58:51,257 --> 00:58:52,918
No, no, no!

800
00:58:52,992 --> 00:58:55,893
Yes, yes, yes!

801
00:58:55,961 --> 00:59:00,261
No... no... no!

802
00:59:02,568 --> 00:59:03,569
This is a scream.

803
00:59:03,604 --> 00:59:03,898
This is a scream.

804
00:59:03,969 --> 00:59:05,903
Give me pictures
like 'The Jazz Singer.'

805
00:59:05,971 --> 00:59:08,940
I love you! I love you!

806
00:59:10,142 --> 00:59:11,905
We're all ruined.

807
00:59:11,977 --> 00:59:13,911
- You can't release this picture.
- We've got to.

808
00:59:13,979 --> 00:59:16,777
We're booked to open in six weeks
all over the country.

809
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:19,977
But you're such big stars,
we might get by.

810
00:59:20,052 --> 00:59:22,043
I never want to see
Lockwood and Lamont again.

811
00:59:22,121 --> 00:59:26,023
- Wasn't that awful?
- This is the worst picture ever made.

812
00:59:26,092 --> 00:59:27,559
I liked it.

813
00:59:36,369 --> 00:59:38,360
Take a last look at it.

814
00:59:38,437 --> 00:59:40,928
It'll be up for auction
in the morning.

815
00:59:41,006 --> 00:59:43,600
You're out of your mind.
Besides, it's Saturday.

816
00:59:43,676 --> 00:59:45,610
No bank's gonna foreclose
until Monday.

817
00:59:45,678 --> 00:59:48,078
- It wasn't so bad.
- That's what I've been telling him.

818
00:59:48,147 --> 00:59:50,172
There's no use kidding myself.

819
00:59:50,249 --> 00:59:52,183
Once they release
'The Dueling Cavalier'...

820
00:59:52,251 --> 00:59:54,446
Lockwood and Lamont are through.

821
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:58,115
The picture's a museum piece.
I'm a museum piece.

822
00:59:58,190 --> 01:00:01,125
Things went wrong with the sound. If you
straighten out the technical end...

823
01:00:01,193 --> 01:00:04,128
It wasn't that. This is sweet
of both of you, but I...

824
01:00:06,098 --> 01:00:08,862
Something happened
to me tonight. I...

825
01:00:08,934 --> 01:00:11,459
Everything you ever said about me
is true.

826
01:00:11,537 --> 01:00:13,801
I'm no actor.
I never was.

827
01:00:13,873 --> 01:00:16,865
Just a lot of dumb show.
I know that now.

828
01:00:18,244 --> 01:00:20,974
Well, at least
you're taking it lying down.

829
01:00:21,046 --> 01:00:25,745
No kidding. Did you ever see anything
as idiotic as me on that screen tonight?

830
01:00:25,818 --> 01:00:27,342
Yeah. How about Lina?

831
01:00:27,420 --> 01:00:30,116
All right.
I ran her a close second.

832
01:00:30,189 --> 01:00:33,124
Maybe it was a photo finish.
Anyway, I'm through.

833
01:00:33,192 --> 01:00:36,252
- You're not through!
- Of course not.

834
01:00:36,328 --> 01:00:39,593
With your looks and figure, you could
drive an ice wagon or shine shoes.

835
01:00:39,665 --> 01:00:41,030
- Block hats.
- Sell pencils.

836
01:00:41,100 --> 01:00:43,398
- Dig ditches.
- Or go back into vaudeville.

837
01:00:44,837 --> 01:00:47,897
Fit as a fiddle and ready for love
I could jump over the moon up above

838
01:00:47,973 --> 01:00:50,203
Fit as a fiddle
and ready for love

839
01:00:51,410 --> 01:00:55,005
Too bad I didn't do that in 'Dueling
Cavalier.' They might have liked it.

840
01:00:55,080 --> 01:00:57,071
- Why don't you?
- What?

841
01:00:57,149 --> 01:00:59,083
- Make a musical.
- Musical?

842
01:00:59,151 --> 01:01:01,085
Sure. Make a musical.

843
01:01:01,153 --> 01:01:04,350
The new Don Lockwood.
He yodels. He jumps about to music.

844
01:01:04,423 --> 01:01:07,358
The only trouble is that after they
release 'Dueling Cavalier'...

845
01:01:07,426 --> 01:01:11,487
nobody would come to see me jump off
the Woolworth Building into a damp rag.

846
01:01:11,564 --> 01:01:14,294
Why don't you turn
'The Dueling Cavalier' into a musical?

847
01:01:14,366 --> 01:01:16,300
- 'Dueling Cavalier'?
- Sure.

848
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:18,529
They've got six weeks
before it's released.

849
01:01:18,604 --> 01:01:21,767
Add songs and dances,
trim the bad scenes, add new ones.

850
01:01:21,841 --> 01:01:23,433
And you got it.

851
01:01:23,509 --> 01:01:25,875
Hey, I think it'll work.

852
01:01:25,945 --> 01:01:27,003
Of course!

853
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:29,274
It may be crazy,
but we're gonna do it.

854
01:01:29,348 --> 01:01:31,976
'The Dueling Cavalier'
is now a musical.

855
01:01:32,051 --> 01:01:34,417
- Hot dog!
- Hallelujah!

856
01:01:34,487 --> 01:01:38,321
Fellas, I feel this is
my lucky day. March 23rd.

857
01:01:38,390 --> 01:01:40,881
- No, your lucky day's the 24th.
- What do you mean?

858
01:01:40,960 --> 01:01:42,928
It's 1:30. It's morning.

859
01:01:42,995 --> 01:01:43,028
Yes, and what a lovely mornin'.

860
01:01:43,063 --> 01:01:46,589
Yes, and what a lovely mornin'.

861
01:01:47,700 --> 01:01:51,227
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'

862
01:01:51,303 --> 01:01:53,237
We've talked
the whole night through

863
01:01:53,305 --> 01:01:55,899
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin' to you

864
01:01:57,676 --> 01:02:00,474
Good mornin', good mornin'

865
01:02:00,546 --> 01:02:02,309
It's great to stay up late

866
01:02:02,381 --> 01:02:04,975
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

867
01:02:07,086 --> 01:02:11,580
When the band began to play
the stars were shining bright

868
01:02:11,657 --> 01:02:15,525
Now the milkman's on his way
It's too late to say good night

869
01:02:15,594 --> 01:02:18,586
So good mornin', good mornin'

870
01:02:18,664 --> 01:02:20,461
Sunbeams will soon smile through

871
01:02:20,533 --> 01:02:23,366
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

872
01:02:23,435 --> 01:02:25,096
And you and you and you

873
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:27,866
Good mornin', good mornin'

874
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:29,805
We've gabbed
the whole night through

875
01:02:29,875 --> 01:02:32,207
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

876
01:02:32,278 --> 01:02:34,269
Nothin' could be grander
than to be in Louisiana

877
01:02:34,346 --> 01:02:36,541
In the morning
In the morning

878
01:02:36,615 --> 01:02:38,810
It's great to stay up late

879
01:02:38,884 --> 01:02:41,352
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

880
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:43,581
Might be just as zippy
if we was in Mississippi

881
01:02:43,656 --> 01:02:45,817
When we left the movie show

882
01:02:45,891 --> 01:02:47,950
The future wasn't bright

883
01:02:48,027 --> 01:02:51,861
But came the dawn, the show goes on
and I don't wanna say good night

884
01:02:51,931 --> 01:02:53,626
So say good mornin'

885
01:02:53,699 --> 01:02:55,428
Good mornin'

886
01:02:55,501 --> 01:02:58,163
Rainbows are shining through
Good mornin'

887
01:02:58,237 --> 01:03:00,364
- Good mornin'
- Bonjour

888
01:03:00,439 --> 01:03:01,497
Monsieur

889
01:03:01,574 --> 01:03:03,701
- Buenos das
- Muchas fras

890
01:03:03,776 --> 01:03:04,868
Buon giorno

891
01:03:05,544 --> 01:03:06,602
Guten Morgen

892
01:03:07,813 --> 01:03:09,440
Good mornin' to you

893
01:04:08,841 --> 01:04:11,071
- Ol!
- Toro!

894
01:04:11,143 --> 01:04:13,805
Toro! Ah-ha!

895
01:04:17,116 --> 01:04:19,311
Charleston!

896
01:05:12,738 --> 01:05:15,036
Hey, we can't make this
a musical.

897
01:05:16,041 --> 01:05:17,906
What do you mean?

898
01:05:22,548 --> 01:05:25,642
She can't act, she can't sing
and she can't dance.

899
01:05:25,718 --> 01:05:27,743
- A triple threat.
- Yeah.

900
01:05:28,921 --> 01:05:30,252
What's so funny?

901
01:05:30,322 --> 01:05:32,381
I'm sorry.
I was just thinking.

902
01:05:32,458 --> 01:05:35,188
I liked her best when the sound
went off and she said...

903
01:05:35,260 --> 01:05:36,852
'Yes, yes, yes!'

904
01:05:36,929 --> 01:05:38,692
No, no, no!

905
01:05:43,068 --> 01:05:46,162
Wait a minute.
I am just about to be brilliant.

906
01:05:46,238 --> 01:05:48,172
Come here, Kathy.

907
01:05:48,240 --> 01:05:50,606
Now sing. I said, 'Sing.'

908
01:05:50,676 --> 01:05:52,769
- Good mornin'
- Good mornin'

909
01:05:52,845 --> 01:05:55,177
- Keep your eyes on my face.
- We talked the whole night through

910
01:05:55,247 --> 01:05:58,216
Good mornin'
Good mornin' to you

911
01:05:58,283 --> 01:05:59,807
Watch my mouth.

912
01:05:59,885 --> 01:06:02,615
Good mornin', good mornin'

913
01:06:02,688 --> 01:06:07,022
It's great to stay up late
Good mornin', good mornin' to you

914
01:06:07,092 --> 01:06:08,650
Well? Convincing?

915
01:06:08,727 --> 01:06:10,490
Enchanting. What?

916
01:06:13,465 --> 01:06:16,457
Don't you get it?
Use Kathy's voice.

917
01:06:16,535 --> 01:06:19,868
Lina moves her mouth, and Kathy's voice
comes over singing and talking for her.

918
01:06:19,938 --> 01:06:23,237
- That's wonderful.
- I couldn't let you do it.

919
01:06:23,308 --> 01:06:25,242
- Why not?
- Because you wouldn't be seen.

920
01:06:25,310 --> 01:06:28,643
- You'd be throwing away your own career.
- It has nothing to do with my career.

921
01:06:28,714 --> 01:06:30,648
It's only for this one picture.

922
01:06:30,716 --> 01:06:32,809
The important thing now
is to save 'The Dueling Cavalier'...

923
01:06:32,885 --> 01:06:34,216
save Lockwood and Lamont.

924
01:06:36,555 --> 01:06:39,718
All right, if it's only
for this one picture, but...

925
01:06:41,927 --> 01:06:44,191
- Do you think it'll get by?
- Of course it will.

926
01:06:44,263 --> 01:06:46,197
Sure, and it's simple
to work the numbers.

927
01:06:46,265 --> 01:06:49,496
Just dance around Lina
and teach her how to take a bow.

928
01:06:49,568 --> 01:06:52,366
All right, we'll spring it
on R.F. in the morning.

929
01:06:52,437 --> 01:06:53,927
Don, you're a genius.

930
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,031
I'm glad you thought of it.

931
01:07:07,252 --> 01:07:09,777
Good night, Kathy.
See you tomorrow.

932
01:07:09,855 --> 01:07:11,345
Good night, Don.

933
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:15,257
Take care of that throat.
You're a big singing star now, remember?

934
01:07:16,361 --> 01:07:19,762
This California dew is just
a little heavier than usual tonight.

935
01:07:19,832 --> 01:07:20,924
Really?

936
01:07:22,000 --> 01:07:25,026
From where I stand, the sun
is shining all over the place.

937
01:08:13,852 --> 01:08:17,948
I'm singin' in the rain

938
01:08:18,023 --> 01:08:21,288
Just singin' in the rain

939
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:24,818
What a glorious feelin'

940
01:08:24,897 --> 01:08:27,457
I'm happy again

941
01:08:28,934 --> 01:08:31,459
I'm laughin' at clouds

942
01:08:31,536 --> 01:08:34,801
So dark up above

943
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:38,232
The sun's in my heart

944
01:08:38,310 --> 01:08:41,541
And I'm ready for love

945
01:08:41,613 --> 01:08:45,276
Let the stormy clouds chase

946
01:08:45,350 --> 01:08:47,784
Everyone from the place

947
01:08:49,588 --> 01:08:51,715
Come on with the rain

948
01:08:51,790 --> 01:08:55,783
I've a smile on my face

949
01:08:55,861 --> 01:08:59,319
I walk down the lane

950
01:08:59,398 --> 01:09:02,925
With a happy refrain

951
01:09:03,001 --> 01:09:04,969
Just singin'

952
01:09:05,037 --> 01:09:08,370
Singin' in the rain

953
01:09:10,709 --> 01:09:13,371
Dancin' in the rain

954
01:09:21,353 --> 01:09:23,947
I'm happy again

955
01:09:31,363 --> 01:09:36,892
I'm singin' and dancin'
in the rain

956
01:11:28,213 --> 01:11:30,579
I'm dancin'

957
01:11:30,649 --> 01:11:32,480
And singin'

958
01:11:32,551 --> 01:11:36,954
In the rain

959
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:56,671
That's wonderful!
Now look.

960
01:11:56,741 --> 01:12:00,973
We'll keep it secret until we're ready
to release, in case it doesn't come off.

961
01:12:01,046 --> 01:12:03,776
But I'm worried about Lina.
She doesn't like Miss Selden.

962
01:12:03,849 --> 01:12:07,615
- There might be fireworks.
- Lina won't even know she's on the lot.

963
01:12:07,686 --> 01:12:11,122
Okay. Boys, this is great.
'The Dueling Cavalier' can be saved.

964
01:12:12,190 --> 01:12:16,024
Now, let's see.
'The Dueling Cavalier' with music.

965
01:12:16,094 --> 01:12:18,460
The title's not right.

966
01:12:18,530 --> 01:12:20,498
We need a musical title. Cosmo?

967
01:12:25,170 --> 01:12:27,161
'The Dueling Mammy.'

968
01:12:32,878 --> 01:12:34,368
I've got it.

969
01:12:39,017 --> 01:12:42,453
- 'The Dancing Cavalier.'
- That's it. 'The Dancing Cavalier.'

970
01:12:42,521 --> 01:12:44,455
Cosmo, remind me to make you
a scriptwriter.

971
01:12:44,523 --> 01:12:46,718
- Thanks, R.F. Have a cigar.
- Thanks.

972
01:12:49,227 --> 01:12:51,991
Now what about the story?

973
01:12:52,063 --> 01:12:54,224
We need modern musical numbers.

974
01:12:58,937 --> 01:13:01,337
How's this? We throw
a modern section into the picture.

975
01:13:01,406 --> 01:13:03,340
The hero's a young hoofer
in a Broadway show.

976
01:13:03,408 --> 01:13:04,841
He sings and dances.

977
01:13:04,910 --> 01:13:07,640
One night backstage, he's reading
'A Tale of Two Cities'...

978
01:13:07,712 --> 01:13:09,646
and a sandbag falls
and hits him on the head...

979
01:13:09,714 --> 01:13:11,648
and he dreams he's back
during the French Revolution.

980
01:13:11,716 --> 01:13:14,150
This way we get in the modern
dancing numbers... Charleston.

981
01:13:14,219 --> 01:13:16,551
But in the dream part,
we can still use the costume stuff.

982
01:13:16,621 --> 01:13:19,283
Sensational! Cosmo,
remind me to give you a raise.

983
01:13:21,426 --> 01:13:22,757
Gimme a raise.

984
01:13:30,502 --> 01:13:35,496
He holds her in his arms

985
01:13:35,574 --> 01:13:37,872
Would you

986
01:13:37,943 --> 01:13:40,343
Would you

987
01:13:40,412 --> 01:13:44,542
He tells her of her charms

988
01:13:44,616 --> 01:13:46,641
Would you

989
01:13:46,718 --> 01:13:49,050
Would you

990
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:53,113
They met as you and I

991
01:13:53,191 --> 01:13:59,061
And they were only friends

992
01:13:59,130 --> 01:14:02,896
But before

993
01:14:02,968 --> 01:14:08,497
The story ends

994
01:14:08,573 --> 01:14:13,169
He'll kiss her with a sigh

995
01:14:13,245 --> 01:14:15,645
Would you

996
01:14:15,714 --> 01:14:17,443
Would you

997
01:14:17,515 --> 01:14:21,713
And if the girl were I

998
01:14:21,786 --> 01:14:23,617
Would you

999
01:14:23,688 --> 01:14:25,679
Would you

1000
01:14:25,757 --> 01:14:29,921
And would you dare to say

1001
01:14:29,995 --> 01:14:35,831
Let's do the same as they

1002
01:14:35,900 --> 01:14:39,927
I would

1003
01:14:40,005 --> 01:14:42,940
Would you

1004
01:14:45,377 --> 01:14:50,144
And would you dare to say

1005
01:14:50,215 --> 01:14:55,585
Let's do the same as they

1006
01:14:56,821 --> 01:15:01,918
I would

1007
01:15:01,993 --> 01:15:07,932
Would you

1008
01:15:11,803 --> 01:15:14,101
Perfect.
That Selden girl is great.

1009
01:15:14,172 --> 01:15:16,640
Once the picture is released,
I'll give her a big buildup.

1010
01:15:16,708 --> 01:15:18,733
- Swell!
- How much is there left to do?

1011
01:15:18,810 --> 01:15:20,744
- One scene and a number.
- What number?

1012
01:15:20,812 --> 01:15:23,178
It's new. It's for
the modern part of the picture.

1013
01:15:23,248 --> 01:15:24,715
It's called 'Broadway Melody.'

1014
01:15:24,783 --> 01:15:28,776
It's the story of a young hoofer
who comes to New York.

1015
01:15:28,853 --> 01:15:31,151
First, we set the stage
with a song.

1016
01:15:31,222 --> 01:15:32,557
It goes like this.

1017
01:15:32,592 --> 01:15:33,182
It goes like this.

1018
01:15:33,258 --> 01:15:37,991
Don't bring a frown
to Old Broadway

1019
01:15:38,063 --> 01:15:43,000
Ah, you gotta clown on Broadway

1020
01:15:43,068 --> 01:15:45,161
Your troubles there

1021
01:15:45,236 --> 01:15:47,170
They're out of style

1022
01:15:47,238 --> 01:15:52,540
For Broadway
always wears a smile

1023
01:15:52,610 --> 01:15:54,737
A million lights

1024
01:15:54,813 --> 01:15:57,111
They flicker there

1025
01:15:57,182 --> 01:16:01,846
A million hearts
beat quicker there

1026
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:06,914
No skies of gray
on that Great White Way

1027
01:16:06,991 --> 01:16:10,927
That's the Broadway

1028
01:16:10,995 --> 01:16:16,433
Melo-dy

1029
01:17:12,924 --> 01:17:14,482
Gotta dance

1030
01:17:21,566 --> 01:17:23,033
Gotta dance

1031
01:17:30,275 --> 01:17:31,867
Gotta dance

1032
01:17:49,727 --> 01:17:50,716
Shh!

1033
01:17:58,403 --> 01:18:00,268
Gotta dance

1034
01:18:00,338 --> 01:18:02,533
Gotta dance

1035
01:18:02,607 --> 01:18:08,045
Gotta dance
Gotta dance

1036
01:18:09,481 --> 01:18:12,041
Broadway rhythm
It's got me

1037
01:18:12,116 --> 01:18:14,778
Everybody dance

1038
01:18:16,154 --> 01:18:18,782
Broadway rhythm
It's got me

1039
01:18:18,857 --> 01:18:21,883
Everybody dance

1040
01:18:21,960 --> 01:18:25,521
Out on that gay White Way
In each merry cafe

1041
01:18:25,597 --> 01:18:28,589
Orchestras play
Takin' your breath away

1042
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:32,130
Broadway rhythm, it's got me

1043
01:18:32,203 --> 01:18:35,661
Everybody sing and dance

1044
01:18:40,178 --> 01:18:41,668
That Broadway rhythm

1045
01:18:46,818 --> 01:18:48,251
That Broadway rhythm

1046
01:18:50,722 --> 01:18:54,089
When I hear that happy beat

1047
01:18:54,158 --> 01:18:57,355
Feel like dancin' down the street

1048
01:18:59,797 --> 01:19:01,321
That Broadway rhythm

1049
01:19:01,399 --> 01:19:03,094
Writhing, beating

1050
01:19:03,167 --> 01:19:04,464
Rhythm

1051
01:19:04,536 --> 01:19:05,901
Gotta dance

1052
01:19:05,970 --> 01:19:08,063
Gotta dance

1053
01:19:08,139 --> 01:19:09,538
Gotta dance

1054
01:19:09,607 --> 01:19:12,906
Gotta dance

1055
01:22:51,896 --> 01:22:54,865
When I hear that happy beat

1056
01:22:54,932 --> 01:22:57,594
Feel like dancin' down the street

1057
01:23:07,478 --> 01:23:10,447
When I hear that happy beat

1058
01:23:10,515 --> 01:23:12,847
Feel like dancin' down the street

1059
01:23:23,628 --> 01:23:26,426
When I hear that happy beat

1060
01:23:26,497 --> 01:23:29,193
Feel like dancing down the street

1061
01:27:37,948 --> 01:27:40,416
Gotta dance

1062
01:27:43,421 --> 01:27:45,355
Gotta dance

1063
01:27:52,763 --> 01:27:54,731
Gotta dance

1064
01:27:54,799 --> 01:27:59,736
Gotta dance
Gotta dance

1065
01:28:28,966 --> 01:28:33,835
That's the Broadway

1066
01:28:33,904 --> 01:28:39,843
Melo-dy

1067
01:28:47,384 --> 01:28:50,020
That's the idea of the number.
What do you think of it?

1068
01:28:50,055 --> 01:28:50,145
That's the idea of the number.
What do you think of it?

1069
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:53,247
I can't quite visualize it.
I'll have to see it on film first.

1070
01:28:53,324 --> 01:28:55,519
- On film it'll be better yet.
- Get goin', fellas.

1071
01:28:55,593 --> 01:28:58,756
You've got to have that Selden girl
rerecord all of Lina's dialogue.

1072
01:28:58,829 --> 01:29:00,797
- It's all set up.
- And remember:

1073
01:29:00,865 --> 01:29:03,129
Don't let Lina know about it.

1074
01:29:05,369 --> 01:29:05,469
All set in there?

1075
01:29:05,504 --> 01:29:06,800
All set in there?

1076
01:29:10,307 --> 01:29:12,901
Nothing can keep us apart.

1077
01:29:12,977 --> 01:29:16,674
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

1078
01:29:17,515 --> 01:29:20,075
All right, Kathy. Go ahead.

1079
01:29:20,151 --> 01:29:22,915
Nothing can keep us apart.

1080
01:29:22,987 --> 01:29:26,684
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

1081
01:29:26,757 --> 01:29:28,748
That's great. Perfect. Cut.

1082
01:29:31,695 --> 01:29:33,686
'Til the stars turn cold.

1083
01:29:34,999 --> 01:29:36,933
Oh, Kathy, I love you.

1084
01:29:38,936 --> 01:29:41,803
I can't wait
'til this picture's finished.

1085
01:29:41,872 --> 01:29:45,364
No more secrecy.
I'm gonna let Lina and everyone know.

1086
01:29:45,442 --> 01:29:48,104
Your fans will be
bitterly disappointed.

1087
01:29:48,179 --> 01:29:51,205
From now on, there's only one fan
I'm worrying about.

1088
01:29:55,486 --> 01:29:57,511
There! What did I
tell you, Lina?

1089
01:29:57,588 --> 01:29:59,715
Thanks, Zelda.
You're a real pal.

1090
01:29:59,790 --> 01:30:02,122
I want that girl
off the lot at once.

1091
01:30:02,193 --> 01:30:05,788
She ain't gonna be my voice.
Zelda told me everything.

1092
01:30:05,863 --> 01:30:08,923
- Thanks, Zelda. You're a real pal.
- Any time, Don.

1093
01:30:08,999 --> 01:30:13,231
- Look, Miss Lamont. Don and I...
- Don? Don't you dare call him Don!

1094
01:30:13,304 --> 01:30:15,704
I was calling him Don
before you were born!

1095
01:30:15,773 --> 01:30:18,503
I mean... I mean...
You were kissing him!

1096
01:30:18,576 --> 01:30:22,137
I was kissing her!
I happen to be in love with her.

1097
01:30:22,213 --> 01:30:25,842
That's ridiculous. Everybody knows
you're in love with me.

1098
01:30:27,351 --> 01:30:30,650
Look, Lina.
Try and understand this.

1099
01:30:30,721 --> 01:30:32,689
I'm going to marry her.

1100
01:30:32,756 --> 01:30:35,486
Silly boy.
She ain't the marrying kind.

1101
01:30:35,559 --> 01:30:38,585
She's just a flirt trying
to get ahead by using you.

1102
01:30:38,662 --> 01:30:43,156
I'll put a stop to that.
I'm gonna go see R.F. right now!

1103
01:30:43,234 --> 01:30:45,395
You're a little late.
The picture's already finished.

1104
01:30:45,469 --> 01:30:47,460
If she weren't in the picture,
you would be finished too.

1105
01:30:47,538 --> 01:30:50,666
As far as I can see,
she's the only one who's finished.

1106
01:30:50,741 --> 01:30:53,073
- Who will ever hear of her?
- Everybody.

1107
01:30:53,143 --> 01:30:55,338
Why do you think Zelda's
in such a sweat?

1108
01:30:55,412 --> 01:30:57,471
Because Kathy nearly stole
the picture from her.

1109
01:30:57,548 --> 01:30:59,812
She's doing you a favor,
helping you in 'The Dancing Cavalier.'

1110
01:30:59,883 --> 01:31:02,317
And she's getting
full screen credit for it too.

1111
01:31:02,386 --> 01:31:06,720
You mean it's gonna say up on the screen
that I don't talk and sing for myself?

1112
01:31:06,790 --> 01:31:08,917
Of course. What do you think?

1113
01:31:08,993 --> 01:31:11,154
- They can't do that.
- It's already done.

1114
01:31:11,228 --> 01:31:13,696
And there's a whole publicity campaign
being planned.

1115
01:31:13,764 --> 01:31:15,254
Publicity?

1116
01:31:15,332 --> 01:31:17,425
They can't make a fool
outta Lina Lamont!

1117
01:31:17,501 --> 01:31:20,402
They can't make a laughingstock
outta Lina Lamont!

1118
01:31:20,471 --> 01:31:23,634
What do they think I am,
dumb or something?

1119
01:31:23,707 --> 01:31:28,610
I make more money than...
than Calvin Coolidge...

1120
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:29,976
put together!

1121
01:31:32,750 --> 01:31:34,877
'Monumental Pictures
wildly enthusiastic...

1122
01:31:34,952 --> 01:31:37,420
over Lina's singing pipes
and dancing stems.'

1123
01:31:37,488 --> 01:31:38,921
I never said that.

1124
01:31:38,989 --> 01:31:43,153
'Premiere tomorrow night to reveal
Lina Lamont big musical talent.'

1125
01:31:43,227 --> 01:31:46,424
Boss, you can't pull a switch
like this on the publicity department.

1126
01:31:46,497 --> 01:31:48,829
We were all prepared on the campaign
for Kathy Selden.

1127
01:31:48,899 --> 01:31:50,958
Now you do this.
At least keep us informed.

1128
01:31:51,035 --> 01:31:54,163
I don't know anything about this.
I had nothing to do with it.

1129
01:31:54,238 --> 01:31:56,502
- What are we gonna do?
- Nothing.

1130
01:31:57,508 --> 01:32:00,204
Absolutely nothing.

1131
01:32:00,277 --> 01:32:06,045
You wouldn't want to call the papers and
say that Lina Lamont is a big fat liar.

1132
01:32:06,116 --> 01:32:08,050
Lina, did you send
this stuff out?

1133
01:32:08,118 --> 01:32:11,349
I gave an exclusive story
to every paper in town.

1134
01:32:11,422 --> 01:32:13,890
You'll never get away with it.
Rod, call the papers back.

1135
01:32:13,957 --> 01:32:18,155
- I wouldn't do that if I were you.
- Don't tell me what to do!

1136
01:32:18,228 --> 01:32:21,026
What do you think I am,
dumb or something?

1137
01:32:21,932 --> 01:32:25,698
I had my lawyer
go over my contract.

1138
01:32:25,769 --> 01:32:29,170
And I control my publicity,
not you.

1139
01:32:29,239 --> 01:32:30,866
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1140
01:32:30,941 --> 01:32:34,035
The studio's responsible for every word
printed about me.

1141
01:32:34,111 --> 01:32:37,376
If I don't like it, I can sue.

1142
01:32:37,448 --> 01:32:38,676
What?

1143
01:32:38,749 --> 01:32:41,013
I can sue.

1144
01:32:41,085 --> 01:32:43,178
If you tell the papers
about Kathy Selden...

1145
01:32:43,253 --> 01:32:48,122
it would be 'detrimental
and deleterious' to my career.

1146
01:32:48,192 --> 01:32:53,027
I could sue you for the whole studio.

1147
01:32:53,097 --> 01:32:57,193
- That's a lot of nonsense.
- Says so right here.

1148
01:32:57,267 --> 01:32:59,565
Contract dated June 8, 1925...

1149
01:32:59,636 --> 01:33:01,900
paragraph 34,
subdivision letter 'A':

1150
01:33:01,972 --> 01:33:05,499
'The party of the first part'...
That's me.

1151
01:33:05,576 --> 01:33:07,066
You win, Lina.

1152
01:33:07,144 --> 01:33:09,169
Take Kathy Selden's
credit off the screen.

1153
01:33:09,246 --> 01:33:12,977
Go ahead. Let's just get
this premiere over with.

1154
01:33:13,050 --> 01:33:14,608
Satisfied?

1155
01:33:14,685 --> 01:33:16,710
Just one little thing more.

1156
01:33:17,855 --> 01:33:19,948
You want me to change
the name of the studio...

1157
01:33:20,023 --> 01:33:21,786
to Lamont Pictures Incorporated?

1158
01:33:21,859 --> 01:33:24,225
Oh, R.F., you're cute.

1159
01:33:24,294 --> 01:33:26,262
I was just thinking...

1160
01:33:26,330 --> 01:33:28,924
you've given this little girl
a part in Zelda's picture...

1161
01:33:28,999 --> 01:33:31,695
and you're gonna give her
an even bigger one in the next?

1162
01:33:31,769 --> 01:33:35,136
- So what?
- So, if she's done such a grand job...

1163
01:33:35,205 --> 01:33:39,733
doubling for my voice, don't you think
she oughta go on doing just that...

1164
01:33:39,810 --> 01:33:41,243
and nothing else?

1165
01:33:41,311 --> 01:33:42,744
You're crazy.

1166
01:33:42,813 --> 01:33:45,646
I'm still more important
to the studio than she is.

1167
01:33:45,716 --> 01:33:47,741
I wouldn't do that to her
in a million years.

1168
01:33:47,818 --> 01:33:51,447
You'd be taking her career away from
her. People don't do things like that.

1169
01:33:51,522 --> 01:33:53,251
People?

1170
01:33:53,323 --> 01:33:55,348
I ain't people.

1171
01:33:55,426 --> 01:33:56,586
I'm a...

1172
01:34:00,564 --> 01:34:02,794
'A shimmering, glowing star...

1173
01:34:02,866 --> 01:34:05,198
in the cinema firmament.'

1174
01:34:05,269 --> 01:34:07,999
It says so. Right there.

1175
01:34:21,118 --> 01:34:23,313
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, my darling.

1176
01:34:23,387 --> 01:34:25,321
At last I've found you.

1177
01:34:26,423 --> 01:34:27,257
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, you're hurt.

1178
01:34:27,292 --> 01:34:28,781
Oh, Pierre.
Pierre, you're hurt.

1179
01:34:28,859 --> 01:34:30,793
Oh, speak to me.

1180
01:34:32,129 --> 01:34:36,793
I'll kiss her with a sigh

1181
01:34:36,867 --> 01:34:41,304
Would you, would you

1182
01:34:41,371 --> 01:34:45,432
And if the girl were I

1183
01:34:45,509 --> 01:34:50,105
Would you, would you

1184
01:34:50,180 --> 01:34:53,343
Oh, Pierre, hold me
in your arms always.

1185
01:34:53,417 --> 01:34:55,009
Lockwood's a sensation.

1186
01:34:55,085 --> 01:34:59,021
Yes, but Lamont. What a voice!
Isn't she marvelous!

1187
01:34:59,089 --> 01:35:01,523
- It's going over wonderfully, isn't it?
- Yeah.

1188
01:35:01,592 --> 01:35:05,551
Our love will last
'til the stars turn cold.

1189
01:35:06,763 --> 01:35:11,530
And would you dare to say

1190
01:35:11,602 --> 01:35:17,472
Let's do the same as they

1191
01:35:18,208 --> 01:35:23,271
I would

1192
01:35:23,347 --> 01:35:29,286
Would you

1193
01:35:51,508 --> 01:35:53,874
- R.F., it's a real smash.
- Congratulations, kids.

1194
01:35:53,944 --> 01:35:55,878
- We owe you a lot.
- Thanks, Mr. Simpson.

1195
01:35:55,946 --> 01:35:58,141
- Kathy, we made it!
- Don, it's a miracle!

1196
01:35:58,215 --> 01:35:59,978
It's just great, Don.

1197
01:36:00,050 --> 01:36:02,382
Lina, you were fabulous.
You sang as well as Kathy.

1198
01:36:02,452 --> 01:36:06,286
Yeah, and I'm gonna
for a long time.

1199
01:36:06,356 --> 01:36:10,952
- What do you mean by that?
- She's gonna go right on singing for me.

1200
01:36:11,028 --> 01:36:12,359
Listen, Lina.

1201
01:36:12,429 --> 01:36:15,227
I thought something was cooking
beneath those bleached curls of yours.

1202
01:36:15,299 --> 01:36:17,733
Now get this!
Kathy has a career of her own.

1203
01:36:17,801 --> 01:36:19,735
She only did this
for the one picture.

1204
01:36:19,803 --> 01:36:21,395
That's what you think.

1205
01:36:21,471 --> 01:36:23,029
Come on!

1206
01:36:23,106 --> 01:36:25,040
Lina's getting carried away,
isn't she, boss?

1207
01:36:25,108 --> 01:36:27,338
- Yes, she is.
- Listen, you boa constrictor.

1208
01:36:27,411 --> 01:36:30,209
Don't get any fancy ideas
about the future. Tell her.

1209
01:36:30,280 --> 01:36:35,013
Never mind! Listen to that applause, and
wait 'til the money starts rolling in.

1210
01:36:35,085 --> 01:36:39,078
You won't give all that up because
some nobody don't wanna be my voice.

1211
01:36:39,156 --> 01:36:41,317
She's got something there.
It's a gold mine.

1212
01:36:41,391 --> 01:36:45,122
Part of that choice is mine,
and I just won't do it.

1213
01:36:45,195 --> 01:36:48,892
You got a five-year contract.
You'll do what R.F. says.

1214
01:36:48,966 --> 01:36:51,662
Why don't you tell her off?

1215
01:36:51,735 --> 01:36:53,930
I'm confused.
This thing is so big...

1216
01:36:54,004 --> 01:36:57,064
- They're tearing the house apart.
- Take a curtain call.

1217
01:36:57,140 --> 01:36:59,335
I once gave you a cigar.
Can I have it back?

1218
01:36:59,409 --> 01:37:01,536
- Wait a minute...
- Listen to 'em! I'm an avalanche!

1219
01:37:01,612 --> 01:37:03,239
Selden, you're stuck!

1220
01:37:03,313 --> 01:37:06,680
If this happens, you'll get yourself
a new boy. I won't stand for it!

1221
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:10,379
Who needs you? They'd come to see me
if I played opposite a monkey!

1222
01:37:10,454 --> 01:37:14,618
Just a minute. Don's a smash too.
I'm still running the studio!

1223
01:37:14,691 --> 01:37:16,318
I'm not so sure!

1224
01:37:16,393 --> 01:37:19,794
You're the big Mr. Producer,
always running things, running me.

1225
01:37:19,863 --> 01:37:23,629
From now on, as far
as I'm concerned, I'm running things.

1226
01:37:23,700 --> 01:37:25,634
Lina Lamont Pictures Incorporated, huh?

1227
01:37:25,702 --> 01:37:27,966
- Yeah.
- You've gone too far.

1228
01:37:28,038 --> 01:37:30,632
- Don, they're yelling for a speech.
- A speech.

1229
01:37:30,707 --> 01:37:33,801
Yeah, everybody's always
making speeches for me.

1230
01:37:33,877 --> 01:37:35,868
Tonight I'm gonna do
my own talking.

1231
01:37:35,946 --> 01:37:38,210
I'm gonna make the speech!

1232
01:37:38,281 --> 01:37:41,409
- You can't do that!
- Wait a minute, Rod.

1233
01:37:41,485 --> 01:37:44,579
This is Lina's big night,
and she's entitled to do the talking.

1234
01:37:46,623 --> 01:37:48,557
- Right?
- Right.

1235
01:37:53,864 --> 01:37:56,025
Ladies and gentlemen...

1236
01:37:56,099 --> 01:37:59,535
I can't tell you how thrilled we are
at your reception...

1237
01:37:59,603 --> 01:38:03,972
for 'The Dancing Cavalier,'
our first musical picture together.

1238
01:38:04,041 --> 01:38:08,478
If we bring a little joy
into your humdrum lives...

1239
01:38:08,545 --> 01:38:12,914
it makes us feel as though our hard work
ain't been in vain for nothin'.

1240
01:38:14,651 --> 01:38:16,380
Bless you all!

1241
01:38:16,453 --> 01:38:18,444
She didn't sound that way
in the picture.

1242
01:38:18,522 --> 01:38:20,149
Cut the talk, Lina. Sing!

1243
01:38:26,697 --> 01:38:28,722
I got an idea.

1244
01:38:34,571 --> 01:38:37,039
What am I gonna do?

1245
01:38:37,107 --> 01:38:40,201
We've got it. Rod, set up
a microphone back of that curtain.

1246
01:38:40,277 --> 01:38:43,735
Kathy, come here. Kathy will
stand back there and sing for you.

1247
01:38:43,814 --> 01:38:47,045
She'll be back of the curtain singing,
and I'll be out in front doing...

1248
01:38:47,117 --> 01:38:48,550
like in the picture?

1249
01:38:48,618 --> 01:38:49,880
- That's right.
- What?

1250
01:38:49,953 --> 01:38:51,887
You gotta do it.
This thing is too big.

1251
01:38:51,955 --> 01:38:54,389
Of course she's got to do it.
She's got a contract.

1252
01:38:54,458 --> 01:38:57,393
- Get over to that microphone.
- You heard him. Do it!

1253
01:38:58,328 --> 01:39:00,159
I'll do it, Don...

1254
01:39:00,230 --> 01:39:03,825
but I never want to see you again,
on or off the screen.

1255
01:39:03,900 --> 01:39:05,333
Come on, Lina.

1256
01:39:09,072 --> 01:39:11,768
What are you going to sing,
Miss Lamont?

1257
01:39:15,445 --> 01:39:16,776
'Singing In The Rain.'

1258
01:39:17,948 --> 01:39:19,381
'Singing In The Rain.'

1259
01:39:20,217 --> 01:39:22,947
'Singing In The Rain.'
In what key?

1260
01:39:25,856 --> 01:39:27,323
'A' flat.

1261
01:39:27,390 --> 01:39:28,448
'A' flat.

1262
01:39:28,525 --> 01:39:29,958
In 'A' flat.

1263
01:39:41,972 --> 01:39:44,406
I'm singin' in the rain

1264
01:39:44,474 --> 01:39:46,908
Just singin' in the rain

1265
01:39:46,977 --> 01:39:49,468
What a glorious feelin'

1266
01:39:49,546 --> 01:39:52,014
I'm happy again

1267
01:39:52,082 --> 01:39:54,676
I'm laughin' at clouds

1268
01:39:54,751 --> 01:39:57,242
So dark up above

1269
01:39:57,320 --> 01:40:02,553
The sun's in my heart
and I'm ready for love

1270
01:40:02,626 --> 01:40:04,890
Let the stormy clouds chase

1271
01:40:04,961 --> 01:40:07,725
Everyone from the place

1272
01:40:07,798 --> 01:40:09,993
Come on with the rain

1273
01:40:10,066 --> 01:40:13,058
I've a smile on my face

1274
01:40:13,136 --> 01:40:15,627
I'll walk down the lane

1275
01:40:15,705 --> 01:40:18,265
With a happy refrain

1276
01:40:18,341 --> 01:40:22,437
I'm singin'
Just singin' in the rain

1277
01:40:24,247 --> 01:40:28,877
I'm singin' in the rain
Just singin' in the rain

1278
01:40:28,952 --> 01:40:31,512
What a glorious feelin'

1279
01:40:31,588 --> 01:40:33,818
I'm happy again

1280
01:40:33,890 --> 01:40:36,324
I'm laughin' at clouds

1281
01:40:36,393 --> 01:40:39,055
So dark up above

1282
01:40:39,129 --> 01:40:44,032
The sun's in my heart
and I'm ready for love

1283
01:40:44,100 --> 01:40:46,068
Let the stormy clouds chase...

1284
01:40:48,405 --> 01:40:51,966
Ladies and gentlemen,
stop that girl running up the aisle!

1285
01:40:52,042 --> 01:40:54,909
That's the girl whose voice
you heard and loved tonight!

1286
01:40:54,978 --> 01:40:57,970
She's the real star
of the picture. Kathy Selden!

1287
01:41:07,290 --> 01:41:10,885
You are

1288
01:41:10,961 --> 01:41:14,795
My lucky star

1289
01:41:16,032 --> 01:41:19,627
I saw you

1290
01:41:19,703 --> 01:41:22,501
From afar

1291
01:41:24,674 --> 01:41:26,733
Two lovely eyes

1292
01:41:26,810 --> 01:41:32,214
At me they were gleaming

1293
01:41:32,282 --> 01:41:36,309
Beaming

1294
01:41:36,386 --> 01:41:42,222
I was starstruck

1295
01:41:42,292 --> 01:41:45,989
You're all

1296
01:41:46,062 --> 01:41:50,863
My lucky charms

1297
01:41:50,934 --> 01:41:55,098
I'm lucky

1298
01:41:55,171 --> 01:41:59,870
In your arms

1299
01:41:59,943 --> 01:42:04,175
You've opened heaven's portal

1300
01:42:04,247 --> 01:42:10,083
Here on Earth
for this poor mortal

1301
01:42:11,321 --> 01:42:15,417
You are

1302
01:42:15,492 --> 01:42:20,293
My lucky

1303
01:42:20,397 --> 01:42:26,336
Star
