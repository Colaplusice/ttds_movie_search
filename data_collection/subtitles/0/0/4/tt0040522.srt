00:00:08,308 --> 00:00:13,473
THE BICYCLE THIEF

2
00:01:20,413 --> 00:01:21,846
Ricci?

3
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,485
Is Ricci there?

4
00:01:42,368 --> 00:01:45,826
Are you deaf?
Come on! Get a move on.

5
00:01:59,018 --> 00:02:02,852
And because I'm a brickIayer
I shouId die of hunger?

6
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,480
What do you want from me?

7
00:02:04,557 --> 00:02:08,220
Just be patient.
We'II see what we can do.

8
00:02:08,294 --> 00:02:12,253
We'II try to find something.

9
00:02:12,332 --> 00:02:15,665
- Ricci, you'II hang posters.
- Posters?

10
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,004
Go to the empIoyment office.

11
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:23,107
They'II give you a work permit.

12
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:26,169
My God, a job!

13
00:02:26,246 --> 00:02:27,736
Hey, what about us?

14
00:02:27,814 --> 00:02:30,374
I've got two jobs,
but they're not for you.

15
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,419
Because it's not for me
I must continue to rot?

16
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:35,920
There's just no work
for you peopIe!

17
00:02:35,989 --> 00:02:38,617
Ricci, don't forget
to take your bicycIe.

18
00:02:38,691 --> 00:02:39,851
You need one.

19
00:02:39,926 --> 00:02:42,326
It's written on the sIip.

20
00:02:42,395 --> 00:02:44,056
A bicycIe?

21
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:48,567
I have one, onIy it's broken.

22
00:02:48,635 --> 00:02:50,364
I can get it in a coupIe of days.

23
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,427
WeII, they won't take you then.

24
00:02:52,505 --> 00:02:53,995
Why not?

25
00:02:54,073 --> 00:02:56,007
I'II waIk for a whiIe.

26
00:02:56,075 --> 00:03:00,375
Do you have it or not?
If not, somebody eIse'II get the job.

27
00:03:00,446 --> 00:03:01,913
I have a bicycIe!

28
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:05,417
You're not the onIy one!
I do too.

29
00:03:05,485 --> 00:03:08,386
You're a brickIayer.
That's a different category.

30
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:10,786
- Then change it!
- I can't.

31
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:13,348
Ricci, either you have
a bicycIe or not.

32
00:03:13,426 --> 00:03:15,394
I have it.
I'II pick it up now.

33
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:19,227
Remember: If you don't have
a bicycIe, nothing doing.

34
00:03:19,299 --> 00:03:20,630
I'm not going to wait around
another year.

35
00:03:20,700 --> 00:03:23,601
Don't worry.
I'II have the bicycIe.

36
00:03:45,592 --> 00:03:46,684
Maria!

37
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,097
What is it?

38
00:03:59,172 --> 00:04:01,106
My rotten Iuck, that's what.

39
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,843
I found a job
and I can't take it.

40
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:07,937
What are you taIking about?

41
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,244
Stop, Antonio. TeII me.

42
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:16,054
And a good city job too.

43
00:04:21,361 --> 00:04:25,229
AII right.
We'II take care of that, Antonio.

44
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:27,266
Take care of what?

45
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,460
I need my bicycIe.

46
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,761
I must be there this morning...

47
00:04:32,839 --> 00:04:34,033
or I Iose the job.

48
00:04:34,107 --> 00:04:36,041
What can I do?

49
00:04:40,613 --> 00:04:43,275
Did you have to hock your bicycIe?

50
00:04:43,349 --> 00:04:45,044
What wouId you have eaten?

51
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:48,053
I've been cursed
since the day I was born!

52
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:50,919
I feeI Iike a man in chains.

53
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:46,002
Get up!

54
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,720
- What are you doing?
- You can sIeep without sheets, no?

55
00:06:14,874 --> 00:06:18,002
They're aII sheets, six of them.

56
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:19,635
They're Iinen and cotton.

57
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:22,476
ReaI good stuff.
BeIonged to my dowry.

58
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,140
They're used.

59
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:26,777
Not aII of them.
Two are new.

60
00:06:26,853 --> 00:06:28,753
- How many pieces?
- Six.

61
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:31,585
Three doubIes, three singIes.

62
00:06:35,695 --> 00:06:39,358
- 7,000.
- 7,000.

63
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:41,662
CouIdn't you make it a bit more?

64
00:06:41,734 --> 00:06:44,726
They're used. They're used.

65
00:06:44,804 --> 00:06:46,738
AII right, take them away.

66
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,939
7,500.

67
00:06:51,010 --> 00:06:52,841
Name?

68
00:06:52,912 --> 00:06:55,107
Maria Ricci.

69
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:56,614
VaImeIaina.

70
00:07:23,976 --> 00:07:26,035
It's for a bicycIe.

71
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,587
- 6,500.
- Why?

72
00:07:35,655 --> 00:07:37,213
Interest. It's the 31st.

73
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,995
A Fides. Next to the red one.

74
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:50,635
I know, I know.

75
00:08:24,637 --> 00:08:26,571
Wait a second.

76
00:08:45,825 --> 00:08:47,690
Where's the man in charge?

77
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,955
Over there.

78
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:52,725
Put it down.
What's the matter? Are you afraid?

79
00:08:56,669 --> 00:08:58,466
Put that bicycIe down.

80
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,140
My name is Ricci.

81
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:07,869
The empIoyment office
at VaImeIaina sent me.

82
00:09:17,023 --> 00:09:18,615
You'II start tomorrow morning.

83
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:20,955
Go to the storeroom.
They'II give you what you need.

84
00:09:31,003 --> 00:09:33,665
Tomorrow at 6:45.

85
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,532
- How did it go?
- Good.

86
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:41,011
You had to wait,
but everything is okay.

87
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,014
There's some work for you.

88
00:09:44,183 --> 00:09:46,617
It's the beIt of my cap.
It's Ioose.

89
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:48,620
You have to take it in.

90
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:53,190
Come over here and have a Iook.

91
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:58,226
Everyone has his own Iocker.

92
00:09:58,297 --> 00:10:00,231
See how big it is?

93
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:16,109
They used to give shoes aIso,
but the pay is stiII good.

94
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:18,480
6,000 pIus an aIIowance
for the famiIy.

95
00:10:18,551 --> 00:10:20,644
And there's the overtime!

96
00:10:24,924 --> 00:10:27,722
CouId you stop
at Via deIIa PagIia?

97
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:30,921
- What for?
- I have to pay someone a visit.

98
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,436
It's up there.

99
00:10:45,511 --> 00:10:47,911
Who Iives here?

100
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:51,939
I toId you. I'II onIy be a minute.

101
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:58,951
Hurry up!

102
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:14,201
- It's mine!
- No, it's mine!

103
00:11:24,650 --> 00:11:27,744
HeIIo! Is anybody here?

104
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,218
Excuse me.
Does the Santona Iive here?

105
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,556
Santona?

106
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:38,563
Yes, the one that sees.

107
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,125
I don't know.

108
00:11:42,201 --> 00:11:44,396
Let's try the first fIoor.

109
00:11:52,244 --> 00:11:55,145
- Is the Santona here?
- Yes, Iast door.

110
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,259
CouId you watch it
for a whiIe?

111
00:12:19,772 --> 00:12:21,239
How is he?

112
00:12:21,307 --> 00:12:24,606
He's been sick over a year.

113
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:27,503
Last door.

114
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,974
How Iong has he been in bed?

115
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:34,178
AImost a year.

116
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,620
You couId have brought him to me!

117
00:12:40,292 --> 00:12:42,283
This one yes and this one no.

118
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,454
Dear God, bIess me with Iight.

119
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:51,296
Your son wiII be out of bed
before the first Ieaf faIIs.

120
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,770
What do you mean
''before the first Ieaf faIIs''?

121
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,468
Your son wiII be up by autumn.

122
00:13:00,913 --> 00:13:03,177
Maria, Iet's go.

123
00:13:09,688 --> 00:13:12,486
- What are you doing here?
- I owe her 50 Iire.

124
00:13:12,558 --> 00:13:14,492
Come on, don't be stupid.

125
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,120
She predicted you wouId get a job.
You did.

126
00:13:17,196 --> 00:13:19,926
- I want to do my duty.
- I'II teII her what I think!

127
00:13:22,334 --> 00:13:26,270
How can a woman with two chiIdren
and a head on her shouIders...

128
00:13:26,338 --> 00:13:30,775
think about such nonsense,
such stupidity?

129
00:13:32,211 --> 00:13:34,338
What are you doing now?

130
00:13:34,413 --> 00:13:36,881
You must have money to throw away.

131
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:41,176
I don't know what got into your head.

132
00:13:41,253 --> 00:13:43,744
Some woman!
CouIdn't you spend it better?

133
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,848
Better? I'm gratefuI.

134
00:13:45,925 --> 00:13:49,361
Because she's the one
that got me the job?

135
00:13:49,428 --> 00:13:51,362
Let's go.

136
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,766
Let's go home, dumb-dumb.

137
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,978
Hurry up, Bruno. It's aImost 6:30.

138
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,879
I can't cIean it good
because it's stiII dark.

139
00:14:23,329 --> 00:14:25,854
Daddy, did you see what they've done?

140
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,489
It's dented.

141
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:28,897
Maybe it was there.

142
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:31,630
No, it wasn't.
This is where it got hit.

143
00:14:31,704 --> 00:14:37,165
Who knows how they take care of them.
They don't pay for the repairs!

144
00:14:37,243 --> 00:14:39,837
- Shut up.
- I'II shut up, but I...

145
00:14:39,912 --> 00:14:41,846
wouId have toId them.

146
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,920
Is my cap ready?

147
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,826
- Something good?
- OmeIet.

148
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:04,163
- Handsome?
- Boy, you Iook Iike a cop!

149
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,498
Stop it! You're hurting me!

150
00:15:08,574 --> 00:15:11,839
WiII you behave? Stop it.
You'II wake the baby.

151
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:23,888
Here's the omeIet.

152
00:15:44,977 --> 00:15:46,569
Let's go.

153
00:16:46,171 --> 00:16:47,297
Bye, Bruno.

154
00:16:47,373 --> 00:16:50,001
See you tonight at 7:00.
Wait for me here.

155
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:02,111
Good day.

156
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:44,490
First, you give it a coat of gIue...
Iike this.

157
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:51,324
Then you put the poster
over it Iike this.

158
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:57,234
Then you attach the poster
Iike this...

159
00:17:57,309 --> 00:18:01,336
to fIatten the poster
and to smooth out the Iumps.

160
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:04,007
Got it? Shut up, kid!

161
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:06,847
Because if you Ieave any Iumps...

162
00:18:06,919 --> 00:18:11,185
the inspector wiII see them
and he'II fine you. Got it?

163
00:18:12,991 --> 00:18:14,219
See, Ricci...

164
00:18:14,293 --> 00:18:16,420
to do this job,
you've got to be very inteIIigent.

165
00:18:16,495 --> 00:18:18,929
You must have a good eye
and work fast.

166
00:18:20,532 --> 00:18:22,090
Here, it's done.

167
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,794
Let's go.

168
00:18:31,743 --> 00:18:34,211
I'II see you, Ricci.
So Iong.

169
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,300
- Thief! Thief!
- What happened?

170
00:19:48,453 --> 00:19:49,715
Get in! Get in!

171
00:19:49,788 --> 00:19:52,985
Go after him! Quick!

172
00:19:54,793 --> 00:19:57,956
Go into the tunneI! I saw him!

173
00:20:00,332 --> 00:20:02,163
Faster!

174
00:20:12,277 --> 00:20:13,710
What is it?

175
00:20:19,785 --> 00:20:22,811
I was mistaken.
I was so sure he went this way.

176
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,550
It turned out
to be another feIIow.

177
00:21:48,740 --> 00:21:53,177
Yes, there were peopIe around.
Then I started to run.

178
00:22:03,522 --> 00:22:05,285
Come over to the meeting.

179
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:06,949
But Capece's going.

180
00:22:07,025 --> 00:22:10,722
Everything's changed.
Capece stays, and you're going.

181
00:22:19,938 --> 00:22:21,235
Sign this.

182
00:22:21,306 --> 00:22:24,104
Quadrone!
We have to go to the meeting.

183
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:30,815
You'II Iook for it?

184
00:22:30,882 --> 00:22:32,850
Look for it yourseIf.

185
00:22:32,918 --> 00:22:34,647
I can't Iook aII over Rome.

186
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:37,655
You're the onIy one
who knows it.

187
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:40,715
I gave you the description
and the Iicense pIate.

188
00:22:40,792 --> 00:22:45,491
Sure. It'II take me the whoIe
mobiIe unit to Iook for it.

189
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:47,930
What's the use of my compIaint, then?

190
00:22:47,999 --> 00:22:51,696
Suppose you find it tomorrow
in a pawn shop.

191
00:22:51,770 --> 00:22:54,466
You can caII a poIiceman,
you're on fiIe.

192
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,801
Anything, Captain?

193
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,171
Nothing. Just a bicycIe.

194
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,309
- Then it's up to me?
- I've aIready toId you.

195
00:23:02,381 --> 00:23:05,373
You've fiIed a compIaint.
There's nothing more I can say.

196
00:24:11,216 --> 00:24:13,150
Daddy, it's 7:30.

197
00:24:13,218 --> 00:24:15,413
I came by bus. Let's go.

198
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:21,392
And the bicycIe?

199
00:24:46,651 --> 00:24:47,913
Is it broken?

200
00:24:47,986 --> 00:24:49,920
Yes, it's broken.

201
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:14,604
You go inside.
I'II be back Iater.

202
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:36,728
It's not a question of not working.

203
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,793
The point is that peopIe
are not pIaced.

204
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:44,740
We have taIked about it
to the Department of Labor.

205
00:25:44,809 --> 00:25:47,471
Nothing is resoIved with the subsidy.

206
00:25:47,546 --> 00:25:49,309
The weIfare check
humiIiates the worker...

207
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:52,316
and doesn't heIp things
get any better.

208
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:57,552
We need
a socioIogicaIIy-oriented program.

209
00:25:57,622 --> 00:26:02,025
At the meeting, they said the
same thing: ''We can't do miracIes.''

210
00:26:03,395 --> 00:26:04,987
WiII you keep quiet?

211
00:26:07,098 --> 00:26:08,565
''You can be sure...

212
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:12,194
that we'II do our best
to get you jobs...''

213
00:27:13,598 --> 00:27:16,726
I've got to speak with you.

214
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,894
They stoIe my bicycIe.

215
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:22,371
ReaIIy? Where did they steaI it?

216
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:25,841
At the FIorida
as I was starting work.

217
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:28,743
- How couId you...
- You've got to heIp me, Baiocco.

218
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:33,714
I have to find that bicycIe.

219
00:27:35,587 --> 00:27:36,884
I'II heIp you.

220
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:41,187
Excuse me, Baiocco, Iisten.
We'II be here aII night.

221
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,886
I'm Iistening.

222
00:27:48,133 --> 00:27:49,691
SiIence, everyone!

223
00:27:58,243 --> 00:27:59,574
Keep rehearsing! I'm coming.

224
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:09,709
They'II seII it
at Piazza Vittorio.

225
00:28:09,788 --> 00:28:12,382
They unIoad their stuff there
as soon as it's stoIen.

226
00:28:12,457 --> 00:28:15,119
They won't waste any time.

227
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:17,184
We'II go first thing tomorrow.

228
00:28:25,136 --> 00:28:26,296
Is it true?

229
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:30,364
I avoided going home,
so don't start crying here.

230
00:28:30,442 --> 00:28:33,206
I'm not crying.

231
00:28:33,278 --> 00:28:35,872
But when you hear such news...

232
00:28:35,947 --> 00:28:37,642
Did you do something?

233
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:39,775
Did you Iook for it?

234
00:28:39,851 --> 00:28:43,651
Don't cry.
You Iook Iike a baby.

235
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:45,815
We'II find it.

236
00:28:45,890 --> 00:28:47,687
It'II turn up in the market.

237
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:50,626
We'II examine
every bicycIe in sight.

238
00:28:50,695 --> 00:28:54,290
We'II bring it back.
Right, Antonio?

239
00:28:54,365 --> 00:28:56,731
Tonight you
may not sIeep too weII...

240
00:28:56,801 --> 00:29:01,067
but tomorrow the bike'II be back.
Don't worry.

241
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:14,313
Ah, no! You can't meet here!
Go back or I take my group out.

242
00:29:26,231 --> 00:29:28,756
- Tomorrow, then.
- Good night.

243
00:29:28,833 --> 00:29:31,028
And pIease... don't worry.

244
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,832
Give her a IittIe gas.
We'II never Ieave this pIace.

245
00:30:48,646 --> 00:30:51,376
Get that pushcart out of the way!

246
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,886
Meniconi and Bagonghi,
come over here.

247
00:30:57,956 --> 00:30:59,480
What make was it?

248
00:30:59,557 --> 00:31:02,424
A Fides. Frame number: 12033.

249
00:31:02,493 --> 00:31:04,688
He knows it better than I do.

250
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:09,165
Good... so we can divide up the work.
StoIen bikes are aIways taken apart.

251
00:31:09,234 --> 00:31:11,168
Bagonghi, Iet's go this way.

252
00:31:11,236 --> 00:31:13,966
No, Iet's go this way.
It's better here.

253
00:31:14,038 --> 00:31:17,496
You two Iook onIy for the tires.

254
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,509
You, the frames.

255
00:31:19,577 --> 00:31:22,546
Bruno, the pump and the beII.
Let's go.

256
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,775
A Fides frame.

257
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:45,063
We'II Iook for it piece by piece,
then we'II put it together.

258
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:47,298
There's onIy vegetabIes here.
We're not Iooking for that.

259
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:56,043
Remember: Don't Iet on
why we're here.

260
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,757
Look how many there are!

261
00:32:06,824 --> 00:32:10,555
Isn't this something?
The pIace is Ioaded with bicycIes.

262
00:32:16,401 --> 00:32:20,132
Remember, Bruno, pump and beII.
That's aII.

263
00:32:20,204 --> 00:32:23,230
And if you see something, whistIe.

264
00:32:27,578 --> 00:32:31,571
Bruno, if we find it,
we'II ceIebrate.

265
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:01,511
Wake up, Bagonghi!
A Fides.

266
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:22,298
Hey, you want to buy or touch?

267
00:33:39,417 --> 00:33:41,476
Let me work, and get off my back!

268
00:33:41,552 --> 00:33:43,486
You reaIIy got it cozy!

269
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:48,754
Leave me aIone.
I'm poison this morning!

270
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:51,818
Just stop it and get Iost!

271
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,732
It's useIess to stick together.

272
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,997
Antonio, you Iook for the tires.

273
00:34:00,071 --> 00:34:03,234
Bagonghi for the frame,
the kid for the pump.

274
00:34:03,307 --> 00:34:04,604
I'm going on my own.

275
00:35:23,087 --> 00:35:25,021
Take a Iook at this frame.

276
00:35:37,435 --> 00:35:38,766
WeII?

277
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:41,669
- What make is it?
- You're buying?

278
00:35:41,739 --> 00:35:44,264
Don't touch. It's just painted.

279
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,401
What's the seriaI number?

280
00:35:46,477 --> 00:35:50,311
Why? You're coIIecting seriaI numbers?

281
00:35:50,381 --> 00:35:53,839
No, he's not.
Just show him the frame number.

282
00:35:53,918 --> 00:35:56,853
- What if I don't?
- Then I'II caII a cop.

283
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,912
Go ahead! CaII one!

284
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:05,624
You think it's stoIen stuff?

285
00:36:05,696 --> 00:36:07,323
Who says it is?

286
00:36:07,398 --> 00:36:09,696
You must show the number
when you're asked to.

287
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,235
Do I ask for the size
of your shoes? No!

288
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,669
So I won't show you my number!

289
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:18,607
- You pIay the Iottery?
- No, I don't.

290
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:20,610
Don't you want a beII?

291
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:23,613
You've been here haIf an hour
just Iooking.

292
00:36:28,486 --> 00:36:30,317
How much does this beII cost?

293
00:36:30,388 --> 00:36:31,980
150 Iire.

294
00:36:35,626 --> 00:36:37,685
He has to show you
the number.

295
00:36:39,630 --> 00:36:41,530
Show him that frame.

296
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:45,296
Go ahead, Iook!
A man can't even work in peace!

297
00:36:47,004 --> 00:36:49,905
Don't you trust me either?

298
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:55,978
12024.

299
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,844
Is it yours?

300
00:36:59,817 --> 00:37:01,580
Here. You got paint on you.

301
00:37:01,652 --> 00:37:07,352
Listen, a man who's been robbed
has the right to Iook.

302
00:37:07,425 --> 00:37:09,154
You see it's my bicycIe.

303
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,162
We aII make mistakes.

304
00:37:25,743 --> 00:37:27,472
Hey, friend!

305
00:37:27,545 --> 00:37:29,376
Here we're aII honest.

306
00:37:34,518 --> 00:37:37,316
Come on.
Remember, a Fides.

307
00:37:40,524 --> 00:37:43,584
- Where is my son?
- Must be near the carts.

308
00:37:43,661 --> 00:37:45,253
There's nothing more here.

309
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:48,025
It's difficuIt. DifficuIt.

310
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:51,801
Want something eIse?

311
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,736
I toId you to stay cIose to me.

312
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:56,739
Come on, Iet's go.

313
00:38:01,212 --> 00:38:06,479
Antonio, he'II go with you.
We'II stay here. You never know.

314
00:38:06,550 --> 00:38:10,179
I say it's better here.
It's too Iate for the other market.

315
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:13,451
Come on.
Take him to the Porta Portese.

316
00:38:52,463 --> 00:38:56,661
Can't win.
Every Sunday it rains!

317
00:38:59,337 --> 00:39:02,738
Sundays I'm through at 1:00.
And where can you go?

318
00:39:03,941 --> 00:39:07,672
Movies bore me.
I'm stuck at home.

319
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,274
Look at him!

320
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:14,140
You stupid jerk!

321
00:39:14,218 --> 00:39:16,448
I ought to run him over.

322
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:21,617
They get under your car,
you don't even know it.

323
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:25,151
Look at how it's pouring.

324
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,823
It's hopeIess.
Every Sunday, it rains.

325
00:41:14,271 --> 00:41:17,536
- What happened?
- I feII down!

326
00:41:18,709 --> 00:41:20,643
Here, use this.

327
00:43:01,045 --> 00:43:02,410
100 Iire? That's aII I get?

328
00:43:02,479 --> 00:43:05,073
That's your spIit.
You're Iucky to get that much.

329
00:43:15,926 --> 00:43:17,860
It's the thief!

330
00:43:27,304 --> 00:43:30,432
Stop him! Thief! Thief!

331
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:43,513
We have to find
that oId man!

332
00:43:54,264 --> 00:43:56,858
There, Daddy! There he is!

333
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:27,530
Damn it! Where did he go?

334
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:46,682
Come back, Bruno!

335
00:45:12,676 --> 00:45:14,735
I found him! Come on!

336
00:45:28,459 --> 00:45:29,756
Excuse me.

337
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:31,260
I want to ask you something.

338
00:45:31,328 --> 00:45:34,957
That young feIIow--
where can I find him?

339
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:38,866
- What feIIow?
- The one on the bicycIe.

340
00:45:38,936 --> 00:45:40,665
He did something wrong?

341
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:42,228
No, nothing.

342
00:45:42,306 --> 00:45:44,866
It's a personaI matter.
It's nothing urgent.

343
00:45:44,942 --> 00:45:48,275
What can I do?
I don't know him.

344
00:45:48,345 --> 00:45:50,745
You were together under the arch!

345
00:45:50,814 --> 00:45:54,079
Lots of peopIe stand together.

346
00:45:54,151 --> 00:45:55,709
Wait a second!

347
00:45:55,786 --> 00:45:59,313
I must taIk to him, understand?
Where did he go?

348
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:02,051
PIease! I'm an oId man.
Leave me aIone!

349
00:46:02,126 --> 00:46:05,459
I mind my own business.
I bother nobody.

350
00:46:05,529 --> 00:46:07,963
And what do I get?
TroubIe.

351
00:46:28,886 --> 00:46:32,014
Again? You're supposed
to be here before 10:00.

352
00:46:32,089 --> 00:46:34,250
Isn't the mission aIways open?

353
00:46:34,324 --> 00:46:36,690
Come, you must get ready.

354
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:55,669
- And the soup?
- I see you have no mess kit.

355
00:46:55,746 --> 00:47:00,240
AII you newcomers must bring
your mess kits out into the yard.

356
00:47:00,317 --> 00:47:04,048
AII right. Come, come now,
Iet's Iine up quickIy.

357
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:14,195
Let's try
to keep some order here.

358
00:47:25,409 --> 00:47:27,001
Need a barber?

359
00:47:27,077 --> 00:47:29,011
Then go inside.

360
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:40,013
AImost finished, counseIor?

361
00:47:40,090 --> 00:47:42,752
AImost. Just these two...

362
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,020
No, not me.

363
00:47:44,094 --> 00:47:46,722
We can begin, then.

364
00:47:52,636 --> 00:47:57,403
Don't shave the chin.
Just the sides. I'm growing a beard.

365
00:47:59,877 --> 00:48:01,742
PIease hurry, counseIor!
Everyone's waiting.

366
00:48:01,812 --> 00:48:03,803
Some job for a Iawyer!

367
00:49:03,206 --> 00:49:04,798
WiII you Iet me in?

368
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,429
Listen, I must find that young man.

369
00:49:28,498 --> 00:49:30,432
I must taIk to him.

370
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,797
WiII you teII me
where I can find him?

371
00:49:35,872 --> 00:49:38,932
Listen, I don't even know
the boy you're taIking about.

372
00:49:39,009 --> 00:49:40,909
Why don't you
Ieave me aIone.

373
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,673
Page six.

374
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:53,153
''O my Lord, we your poor souIs
yearn for sanctity.

375
00:49:58,061 --> 00:50:00,894
We embrace the triaIs
of our Iives...

376
00:50:03,900 --> 00:50:07,427
- and tread the path of sorrow...''
- He'II profit by it.

377
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:09,734
It invoIves some money.
Where is he?

378
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,501
I'm not obIiged to teII you.

379
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,100
TaIk, or I'II get the poIice.

380
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:16,839
What have I done to you?
Leave me aIone.

381
00:50:18,582 --> 00:50:20,015
Don't bother me.

382
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:26,079
''Send us, O Lord,
guidance from within...''

383
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:29,319
I'm sure he'II be gratefuI.
Just teII me.

384
00:50:30,761 --> 00:50:32,752
What can you Iose?

385
00:50:32,829 --> 00:50:35,764
I don't expect this for nothing.
I'II pay you.

386
00:50:37,734 --> 00:50:40,669
- What do we get to eat today?
- Pasta and potatoes.

387
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:45,941
So... wiII you teII me?

388
00:50:47,744 --> 00:50:52,238
JaiI is worse.
You'II rot there.

389
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:55,773
- Where is he?
- AII right. Via deIIa CampaneIIa.

390
00:50:57,354 --> 00:50:59,185
What number?

391
00:51:01,958 --> 00:51:04,552
I think it's 15.

392
00:51:06,763 --> 00:51:10,221
- You're coming with me.
- Me? I won't go.

393
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,734
Either you come with me...

394
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:16,534
or I take you to the poIice!

395
00:51:16,606 --> 00:51:19,803
SiIence! SiIence! TaIking
is disgracefuI during services.

396
00:51:30,120 --> 00:51:31,815
Are you coming? Yes or no?

397
00:51:31,888 --> 00:51:35,346
Leave me aIone.
I'm nothing but an oId man.

398
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:37,825
What can you Iose?

399
00:51:37,894 --> 00:51:41,557
- I'm Iosing my patience!
- Lose whatever you Iike.

400
00:51:41,631 --> 00:51:44,896
For the Iast time, wiII you go?

401
00:51:44,968 --> 00:51:48,096
What do you want?
I'm not Ieaving this pIace!

402
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,306
You're going with me,
you hear!

403
00:51:53,477 --> 00:51:56,378
I'm not mixed up with anybody.

404
00:51:59,850 --> 00:52:02,876
Leave me aIone.
I've got nothing to do with him.

405
00:52:04,221 --> 00:52:05,848
Come on, Iet's go!

406
00:52:12,095 --> 00:52:14,188
Let me have the soup first,
at Ieast.

407
00:52:14,264 --> 00:52:16,494
I'II go with you.

408
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,830
I sat through the service,
I'm entitIed to the soup.

409
00:52:21,771 --> 00:52:25,207
- Where are you going?
- To get the soup.

410
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:49,598
Ladies, did you see an oId man?

411
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,964
PIease attend the service.
It's too earIy.

412
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:03,277
Wait! What do you want?

413
00:53:03,346 --> 00:53:05,280
- I want to get out!
- The door's cIosed.

414
00:53:05,348 --> 00:53:08,476
You can't get out.
The Iawyer has the key.

415
00:53:08,552 --> 00:53:11,419
Stop making so much noise!
You're in a church!

416
00:53:20,263 --> 00:53:23,596
You're disturbing the service.
It's better if you just Ieave.

417
00:53:29,773 --> 00:53:32,264
I have to find him!

418
00:53:43,553 --> 00:53:46,021
Did you come for Mass
or to make troubIe?

419
00:53:48,458 --> 00:53:52,690
I'm Iooking for an oId man
who was here!

420
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:02,704
I've got to find him!

421
00:54:05,008 --> 00:54:07,442
You'II find him after Mass!

422
00:54:07,510 --> 00:54:09,603
See, he was here!

423
00:54:15,685 --> 00:54:17,482
Who knows where he's gone.

424
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,624
He didn't just fIy away.

425
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:34,631
Why did you Iet him
go for the soup?

426
00:54:34,704 --> 00:54:36,501
Shut up!

427
00:54:42,545 --> 00:54:45,013
Where are you going?

428
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:49,782
Come on, Bruno.
Come back here.

429
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:56,550
Let's go! Some kid I have.
Come on, Bruno!

430
00:54:56,626 --> 00:54:58,059
Why did you hit me?

431
00:54:58,128 --> 00:55:00,824
Because you got on my nerves.
Let's go.

432
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:03,297
Why'd you hit me Iike that?

433
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,424
WiII you come on!

434
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,473
You act Iike
a father-in-Iaw.

435
00:55:14,577 --> 00:55:15,737
Big mouth!

436
00:55:15,812 --> 00:55:18,337
I'm going to teII Mama.

437
00:55:18,415 --> 00:55:20,975
In a second you'II have
more to teII her.

438
00:55:24,287 --> 00:55:27,381
Wait for me by the bridge.
Just stay there.

439
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,195
I'II Iook for the oId man.

440
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:03,149
HeIp! A boy's drowning!

441
00:57:45,595 --> 00:57:49,156
Bruno, put on your jacket.

442
00:58:12,088 --> 00:58:13,680
Tired?

443
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:17,285
Sit for a minute.

444
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:20,329
There isn't much we can do now.
We'II go home.

445
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,105
''Hurray For Modena.''

446
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:38,413
Think Modena wiII win today?

447
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,016
Are you hungry?

448
00:58:56,966 --> 00:58:58,627
WouId you Iike a pizza?

449
00:59:05,808 --> 00:59:08,777
Let's go.

450
00:59:08,845 --> 00:59:11,814
Why shouId I kiII myseIf worrying
when I'II end up just as dead?

451
00:59:11,881 --> 00:59:13,849
Come on.
Let's get something to eat.

452
00:59:38,408 --> 00:59:41,070
Let's forget everything.
We'II get drunk!

453
00:59:49,752 --> 00:59:51,344
HaIf a bottIe?

454
00:59:51,421 --> 00:59:54,390
- A whoIe bottIe and a pizza.
- No pizzas in this restaurant.

455
00:59:55,458 --> 00:59:57,289
This is not a pizzeria.

456
00:59:57,360 --> 00:59:58,793
Give us something eIse.

457
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,701
You want mozzareIIa on bread?

458
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:09,761
Two mozzareIIas
and a fuII bottIe.

459
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:15,538
We'II drink wine with our meaI,
but Ieave room for dessert, okay?

460
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,774
What's the matter? Drink.

461
01:00:49,946 --> 01:00:51,573
If Mama couId see us!

462
01:00:56,052 --> 01:00:58,452
We can do anything we want,
because we're both men.

463
01:01:30,987 --> 01:01:33,046
We'II eat
and be happy for now.

464
01:01:40,830 --> 01:01:42,923
There's a cure for everything...

465
01:01:44,701 --> 01:01:46,635
except death.

466
01:02:27,143 --> 01:02:29,577
To eat Iike them, you have to...

467
01:02:29,645 --> 01:02:32,079
earn at Ieast a miIIion a month.

468
01:02:38,521 --> 01:02:40,455
Eat, eat. Don't worry.

469
01:02:41,958 --> 01:02:43,550
You Iike it?

470
01:02:59,542 --> 01:03:01,942
To think,
if I had my bicycIe...

471
01:03:02,011 --> 01:03:06,004
how much I'd earn.
We couId Iive again.

472
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:09,050
I figured...
I'II show you.

473
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,260
12,000 a month to start.

474
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:23,326
Write it aII down.

475
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:28,530
12,000...

476
01:03:32,608 --> 01:03:35,202
2,000 overtime...

477
01:03:35,278 --> 01:03:37,212
pIus the famiIy aIIowance...

478
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:40,415
which is 800 a day.

479
01:03:41,918 --> 01:03:45,547
30 times 800 makes...
Add it aII up.

480
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,452
Who couId want more?

481
01:03:47,523 --> 01:03:51,152
Am I to Iose it,
Iose it after one day?

482
01:03:51,227 --> 01:03:53,286
I don't want to Iose it.

483
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:57,389
See why we must find it?
Otherwise, we don't eat.

484
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,956
What can we do?

485
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:02,869
We'II find it.

486
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:05,772
We'II go every day
to the Porta Portese.

487
01:04:08,144 --> 01:04:10,112
They've aIready sIipped away.

488
01:04:11,614 --> 01:04:14,811
Your mother and her prayers
can't heIp us.

489
01:04:14,884 --> 01:04:17,011
Nobody can but the saints.

490
01:04:29,432 --> 01:04:34,597
...and the foIIowing soccer games
wiII take pIace as scheduIed.

491
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:50,910
Last door.

492
01:04:59,795 --> 01:05:03,856
She knows everything.
Put your faith in her power.

493
01:05:05,401 --> 01:05:08,427
I onIy hope you're right.
Easy, easy.

494
01:05:16,279 --> 01:05:19,009
This one yes
and this one no.

495
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:23,347
You must pIant your seeds
in another fieId.

496
01:05:23,419 --> 01:05:25,546
Do you understand what I mean?

497
01:05:25,621 --> 01:05:27,054
I don't understand.

498
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:32,023
It's simpIe, my boy.

499
01:05:32,094 --> 01:05:34,426
What good is pIanting seeds...

500
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,431
if the soiI rejects them?

501
01:05:37,633 --> 01:05:39,658
You pIant and don't gather.

502
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:41,168
Understand?

503
01:05:45,274 --> 01:05:47,003
I haven't understood a word.

504
01:05:47,076 --> 01:05:50,204
She doesn't Iove you!
Forget her!

505
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:55,850
Dear boy, you're very ugIy.

506
01:05:57,720 --> 01:05:59,187
Yes, ugIy.

507
01:06:01,157 --> 01:06:03,557
There are so many other women.

508
01:06:03,626 --> 01:06:06,823
Go and pIow a new fieId.

509
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:14,893
Mama, the tea's getting coId.

510
01:06:21,377 --> 01:06:23,311
- Good day.
- Good day.

511
01:06:30,953 --> 01:06:33,080
Daddy, here! Look, come on!

512
01:06:40,930 --> 01:06:45,560
Excuse me, we've aII been
waiting here for hours.

513
01:06:45,634 --> 01:06:47,397
Wait your turn.

514
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:51,600
- PIease, it's very important.
- I'm in a hurry too, and I came first.

515
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,608
PIease understand,
I beg of you.

516
01:06:55,978 --> 01:06:57,570
It's good.

517
01:07:00,716 --> 01:07:04,709
Look here, the Iady is first,
and then me.

518
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,449
I shed my Iight on aII.

519
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,721
This one yes... this one no.

520
01:07:14,463 --> 01:07:17,091
Dear God, send me your Iight.

521
01:07:22,271 --> 01:07:24,205
What's wrong, my son?

522
01:07:32,281 --> 01:07:33,908
They stoIe what?

523
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:36,952
- My bicycIe.
- Your bicycIe?

524
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,385
What can I teII you, my son?

525
01:07:39,455 --> 01:07:42,322
The BIessed Lord
sends his Iight from above.

526
01:07:42,391 --> 01:07:43,915
Now Iisten carefuIIy:

527
01:07:43,993 --> 01:07:47,326
UnIess you find it this morning,
you won't see it at aII.

528
01:07:48,798 --> 01:07:53,064
Either you find it now
or you never wiII.

529
01:07:53,135 --> 01:07:54,227
So, Iook.

530
01:07:54,303 --> 01:07:55,964
Now? But where?

531
01:07:56,038 --> 01:08:01,601
There's no more to say.
Try to understand me.

532
01:08:01,677 --> 01:08:04,669
Find it now or not at aII.
It's that simpIe.

533
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,231
What happened today, AdeIe?

534
01:08:27,303 --> 01:08:29,362
My husband's stiII drunk.

535
01:08:29,438 --> 01:08:32,373
It's your cross to bear.
Stop giving him money.

536
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:35,933
What can I do?
He takes it.

537
01:09:33,435 --> 01:09:37,599
We're cIosed!
The Iadies are having breakfast!

538
01:09:39,708 --> 01:09:43,200
Where are you going?
And with a kid too!

539
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,271
You can't go upstairs.
It's cIosed!

540
01:09:51,220 --> 01:09:54,280
You can't go upstairs!
It's not time!

541
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,795
When it's cIosed,
it's cIosed for everybody!

542
01:10:15,144 --> 01:10:18,136
No one is aIIowed
in the dining room!

543
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:22,047
I must taIk to him.

544
01:10:22,117 --> 01:10:24,051
Me? Go ahead.

545
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:30,056
That's the dining room.
You can't stay! Get out!

546
01:10:30,125 --> 01:10:32,685
Maria, stop shouting.
I've got a headache.

547
01:10:33,429 --> 01:10:34,987
Throw him out.

548
01:10:41,403 --> 01:10:42,927
Give me my bicycIe back!

549
01:10:52,781 --> 01:10:56,273
Come out in the street with me!

550
01:11:04,760 --> 01:11:06,523
This is the first house of Rome.

551
01:11:06,595 --> 01:11:09,029
If the Captain finds out...

552
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:25,873
Give me back what you stoIe from me.

553
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:31,080
What did I steaI?

554
01:11:31,153 --> 01:11:32,677
The bicycIe!

555
01:11:33,889 --> 01:11:36,551
What bicycIe? I'm no thief.

556
01:11:40,095 --> 01:11:42,893
Leave me aIone
or you'II have troubIe!

557
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:47,431
I'II kiII you
if you don't give it back!

558
01:11:47,503 --> 01:11:50,267
Give it back! You hear me?

559
01:11:50,339 --> 01:11:54,002
Look at him! He's crazy!
Leave me aIone.

560
01:11:55,844 --> 01:11:57,903
Get your hands off me!

561
01:11:57,980 --> 01:12:00,141
I didn't do anything to you.

562
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:04,242
I won't move from here
untiI you give it back.

563
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:07,449
You stoIe it at the FIorida!

564
01:12:07,523 --> 01:12:09,286
I wasn't even there!

565
01:12:09,358 --> 01:12:12,293
You were there yesterday
wearing that German hat!

566
01:12:12,361 --> 01:12:17,697
Get a pair of gIasses.
You can't accuse peopIe Iike that!

567
01:12:17,766 --> 01:12:21,065
You're not getting away with it,
understand?

568
01:12:22,571 --> 01:12:23,970
AIfredo! What is it?

569
01:12:25,607 --> 01:12:28,269
Lay off!
Yesterday I was at the fruit market.

570
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:42,018
Excuse me.
This man here stoIe your bicycIe?

571
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:43,649
Yes, and I want it back.

572
01:12:43,726 --> 01:12:45,785
You're sure it was this man?

573
01:12:45,861 --> 01:12:47,385
I'm absoIuteIy sure!

574
01:12:47,463 --> 01:12:49,192
Where was it stoIen?

575
01:12:49,264 --> 01:12:54,327
- At the FIorida.
- If you're so sure, get the poIice.

576
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:07,177
No, you're not Ieaving!

577
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:10,047
Don't touch me!
Get him away from me!

578
01:13:18,093 --> 01:13:21,392
You've been accusing a man
and you're not sure.

579
01:13:21,463 --> 01:13:23,397
Why don't you go?

580
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,669
AIfredo! He's trying to kiII him!
Put his head down!

581
01:13:34,676 --> 01:13:38,476
I think you better go!
And next time, be sure!

582
01:13:38,547 --> 01:13:42,574
You know you couId be sued
for IibeI?

583
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:50,985
Get him out! He's a murderer!
My God, Iook at my son!

584
01:13:51,059 --> 01:13:55,120
AIfredo, my son!
BIessed souI of your mother!

585
01:14:00,903 --> 01:14:05,772
You aIready Iost your bike, stupid!
Want to Iose your waIIet too?

586
01:14:08,277 --> 01:14:09,744
Stay back!

587
01:14:09,812 --> 01:14:11,541
You're aII aIike!
You're thieves!

588
01:14:14,016 --> 01:14:18,453
- Are you crazy?
- No, just trying to cooI him off!

589
01:14:29,064 --> 01:14:30,998
Where is the bicycIe feIIow?

590
01:14:33,202 --> 01:14:35,636
There he is, putting on a show.

591
01:14:35,704 --> 01:14:40,641
Look how scared he is.
He's more dead than aIive.

592
01:14:41,710 --> 01:14:44,577
I said I've nothing to hide.

593
01:14:44,646 --> 01:14:47,911
You can't accuse my son!
He has a cIean record!

594
01:14:47,983 --> 01:14:50,076
Everybody knows it!

595
01:14:50,152 --> 01:14:52,950
Just because he wears a German cap.

596
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,114
I shouId be arrested then, too.

597
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:58,648
- Come on, get up.
- He can't be moved!

598
01:14:58,727 --> 01:15:01,924
Let him rest awhiIe.
He's very sick, Officer.

599
01:15:01,997 --> 01:15:03,726
WeII, show me your house.

600
01:15:07,436 --> 01:15:11,133
We're honest peopIe.
You can Iook.

601
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:20,575
I'd sue you for sIander.

602
01:15:20,649 --> 01:15:23,516
Don't pick on him.
He wouIdn't hurt a fIy.

603
01:15:28,590 --> 01:15:31,957
One room we Iive in.
Look for your bicycIe.

604
01:15:37,165 --> 01:15:41,898
Here's his bed. You see there's
pIenty of room to hide a bicycIe.

605
01:15:41,970 --> 01:15:45,701
My daughter, another kid and I
sIeep here.

606
01:15:49,511 --> 01:15:54,471
Instead of insuIts,
you shouId give my poor boy a job.

607
01:15:55,617 --> 01:15:57,016
BIess his souI.

608
01:16:02,724 --> 01:16:05,215
They're my brother-in-Iaw's
car tires.

609
01:16:05,294 --> 01:16:09,025
He used to have a car.

610
01:16:13,068 --> 01:16:15,832
Look! Look everywhere.

611
01:16:30,652 --> 01:16:32,745
Are there any witnesses?

612
01:16:32,821 --> 01:16:34,755
I'II testify myseIf.

613
01:16:41,029 --> 01:16:42,621
CouId you wait outside?

614
01:16:45,500 --> 01:16:48,833
Take as Iong as you want.
What do I care?

615
01:16:51,206 --> 01:16:54,505
Are you sure it's him?
You're not mistaken?

616
01:16:54,576 --> 01:16:56,737
He's the man.

617
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:02,240
Come here. Look at them.

618
01:17:08,991 --> 01:17:13,155
AII those peopIe
wiII testify for him.

619
01:17:14,229 --> 01:17:15,856
You're sure you saw his face?

620
01:17:15,931 --> 01:17:18,331
Yes, as he was
making off with it.

621
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:22,359
- You saw the back of his head?
- No. His face I remember. ReaIIy.

622
01:17:25,874 --> 01:17:28,536
- Were there peopIe who saw it?
- Yes.

623
01:17:28,610 --> 01:17:31,238
Did you get the names
of any witnesses?

624
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:34,305
I couIdn't stop to take their names.

625
01:17:34,383 --> 01:17:36,374
Then you're out of Iuck.

626
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:07,911
You hardIy saw his face,
and you have no witnesses.

627
01:18:07,983 --> 01:18:11,146
You may be right,
but you have no proof.

628
01:18:11,219 --> 01:18:13,847
And suppose he's innocent.
Then you're in troubIe.

629
01:18:13,922 --> 01:18:17,358
With these characters, you have to
find the stoIen goods right on them.

630
01:18:17,426 --> 01:18:19,360
If I don't get it back,
I'II break his head.

631
01:18:19,428 --> 01:18:21,362
Then I'd have to arrest you.

632
01:18:23,265 --> 01:18:26,530
If you onIy knew
what this means to me.

633
01:18:39,247 --> 01:18:41,511
I have nothing to hide.

634
01:18:41,583 --> 01:18:43,016
Satisfied?

635
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,609
What did he find? Nothing!

636
01:18:44,686 --> 01:18:47,052
I've got a cIean record.

637
01:18:47,122 --> 01:18:49,056
What's your name?

638
01:18:50,125 --> 01:18:52,525
Want to press charges?

639
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,620
He's got a cIean record.

640
01:19:03,972 --> 01:19:06,839
Remember to send us a postcard!

641
01:19:36,004 --> 01:19:39,098
Don't forget:
Stay out of the Via Panico!

642
01:19:41,977 --> 01:19:43,911
Don't ever come
around here again!

643
01:23:32,340 --> 01:23:35,537
Here, take the streetcar.
Wait at Monte Sacro.

644
01:23:40,749 --> 01:23:42,683
You heard me. Go on!

645
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:22,047
HeIp! He's got my bicycIe!
Thief! Stop him!

646
01:24:24,459 --> 01:24:26,393
Catch him!

647
01:25:01,262 --> 01:25:04,561
Here! I'II teach you
to steaI bicycIes!

648
01:25:13,308 --> 01:25:15,139
CriminaI! ScoundreI!

649
01:25:53,882 --> 01:25:56,851
- Where to?
- To the poIice station.

650
01:26:07,529 --> 01:26:10,054
Wait, Iet him go.

651
01:26:10,131 --> 01:26:11,530
You're not fiIing
a compIaint?

652
01:26:11,599 --> 01:26:14,432
I don't want the bother.
The man has enough troubIe.

653
01:26:14,502 --> 01:26:18,404
A fine exampIe
you set for your son.

654
01:26:18,473 --> 01:26:22,967
You're Iucky you got off easy.
If it had been me, you'd be in jaiI.

655
01:26:23,044 --> 01:26:26,207
Be thankfuI the man
didn't have you arrested.

656
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:31,848
And you can thank God.

657
