00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,680
Can I help you?

3
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:31,350
They told me to take a
streetcar named Desire...

4
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:34,080
...then transfer to one
called Cemeteries...

5
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:36,920
...ride 6 blocks and get
off at Elysian Fields.

6
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,520
There's your car.

7
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,530
Thanks.

8
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,750
When he got home, she was waiting.

9
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,640
You never heard nothing...

10
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:42,660
What's wrong? You lost?

11
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:44,860
I'm looking for Elysian Fields.

12
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:47,430
This is Elysian Fields. What number?

13
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,660
642.

14
00:03:49,900 --> 00:03:51,930
Don't need to look no further.

15
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,100
I'm looking for my sister, Stella
DuBois, I mean, Mrs. Stanley Kowalski.

16
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,180
That's the party, all right.
You just did miss her, though.

17
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,170
This...

18
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,510
Can this be her home?

19
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:08,950
She lives downstairs, I live up.

20
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,950
She's out?

21
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,790
You notice the bowling alley?

22
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,390
- I'm not sure I did.
- That's where she's at.

23
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:18,190
She's watching Stanley bowl.

24
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:30,140
Blanche!

25
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:36,970
Stella!

26
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:39,150
Oh, Stella for a star!

27
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:42,150
My darling. Now, then,
let me look at you.

28
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,720
But don't look at me. I won't
be looked at in this glare.

29
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,650
- Did you find our place?
- What're you doing in a place like that?

30
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:51,920
Never, never in my worst
dreams did I picture...

31
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:55,500
Only Poe, Mr. Edgar Allan Poe,
could do justice to it!

32
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,000
What are you doing in that horrible
place? I didn't mean to say that.

33
00:05:00,210 --> 00:05:03,440
I meant to be nice and say,
"What a convenient location!"

34
00:05:03,610 --> 00:05:06,440
- You haven't said a word to me.
- I haven't had a chance.

35
00:05:06,610 --> 00:05:08,840
Now open your pretty mouth and talk.

36
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:11,740
- Come say hello to Stanley first.
- No, not now.

37
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,950
Just say hello.

38
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,180
Which is he? Which one is he?

39
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:22,950
Is he the one...

40
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,260
The one making all the rhubarb!

41
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,530
Isn't he wonderful-Iooking?

42
00:05:33,370 --> 00:05:36,860
I can't meet him now.
Not till I've bathed and rested.

43
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:40,600
- Would you like a cold drink?
- Bless that lovely inspiration.

44
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,780
Oh, baby.

45
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:50,480
Would you like some pop?

46
00:05:50,660 --> 00:05:52,280
Honey! Pop!

47
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,220
Not with my nerves tonight.
A scotch please.

48
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,890
Grape.

49
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,500
You haven't asked me how I happened
to get away from school...

50
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:02,220
...before the term ended.

51
00:06:02,430 --> 00:06:05,060
Thought you'd tell me if you wanted to.

52
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,500
You thought I'd been fired?

53
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:10,570
No! I thought you might have resigned.

54
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:15,010
I was so exhausted by all I'd
been through, my nerves broke.

55
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:19,150
I was on the verge of lunacy, almost.

56
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:22,410
So Mr. Graves... He's the
high school superintendent...

57
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:24,590
Thank you. He suggested...

58
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,650
...I take a leave of absence.

59
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:32,090
I couldn't put all those details
into the wire. This feels so good.

60
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:33,590
Like another?

61
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:37,330
One's my limit. You haven't
said a word about my appearance.

62
00:06:37,570 --> 00:06:38,830
You look fine.

63
00:06:39,070 --> 00:06:43,100
God love you for a liar.
Daylight never exposed so total a ruin.

64
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:47,540
But you've put on some weight.
You're as plump as a partridge.

65
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:49,540
It's so becoming to you.

66
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:52,280
Yes, it is! Or I wouldn't say it!

67
00:06:52,480 --> 00:06:55,280
You just have to watch
around the hips a little.

68
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:59,780
I wanted you to look at my figure.
I haven't put on one ounce in 10 years.

69
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,960
I weigh now what I weighed the
summer you left Belle Reve...

70
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,460
...the summer Dad died and you left us.

71
00:07:12,340 --> 00:07:15,640
It's just incredible,
Blanche, how well you look.

72
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,470
Sure you don't want another?

73
00:07:20,850 --> 00:07:24,650
Maybe I will take just
one tiny nip more...

74
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,480
...to put the stopper on.

75
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:29,310
Don't worry, your sister's not a drunk.

76
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:34,390
She's just all shaken up
and hot and dirty and tired.

77
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,590
Waiter!

78
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,460
Waiter!

79
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:43,830
You want it hot?

80
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:45,230
Scalding.

81
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:51,110
What is it?

82
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,340
There's only two rooms.
Where will you put me?

83
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,410
We'll put you right here.

84
00:07:56,650 --> 00:08:00,350
What kind of a bed's this?
One of those collapsible things?

85
00:08:00,550 --> 00:08:01,680
You all right?

86
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:05,010
Wonderful, honey. I don't
like a bed that gives much.

87
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:09,180
There's no door between the two rooms.
Will it be decent?

88
00:08:09,390 --> 00:08:11,760
Stanley's Polish, you know.

89
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,860
Something like Irish, isn't it?

90
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,120
Well...

91
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,270
I bought some nice clothes to
meet all your lovely friends in.

92
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:23,140
Well, I'm afraid you won't
think they're lovely.

93
00:08:23,310 --> 00:08:26,040
I bought nice clothes
and I'll wear them.

94
00:08:27,250 --> 00:08:30,040
I guess you're hoping I'll
say I'll put up at a hotel.

95
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:32,050
But I'm not going to.

96
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:36,780
I must be near you. I must be
with people. I can't be alone...

97
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:39,550
...because, as you must have noticed...

98
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,790
...I'm not very well.

99
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:43,960
You do seem...

100
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:49,060
Will Stanley like me or will
I just be a visiting in-law?

101
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:50,560
I couldn't stand that.

102
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,560
You'll get along fine.
Try not to compare him...

103
00:08:54,770 --> 00:08:55,970
He was an officer?

104
00:08:56,210 --> 00:08:59,970
He was a master sergeant,
decorated 4 times.

105
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:04,740
- He had those on when you met him?
- I wasn't just blinded by the brass.

106
00:09:04,950 --> 00:09:05,920
I wasn't...

107
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,990
There were things to
adjust myself to later on.

108
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:13,190
Such as his... civilian background?

109
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:15,680
How'd he take the news I was coming?

110
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:18,990
- He's on the road a good deal.
- Oh, he travels?

111
00:09:19,230 --> 00:09:21,320
Good. I mean, isn't it?

112
00:09:21,530 --> 00:09:24,700
I can hardly stand it when
he's away for a night.

113
00:09:25,870 --> 00:09:29,000
- Lf he's away for a week, I go wild.
- Gracious!

114
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:33,200
When he comes back, cry
on his lap like a baby.

115
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:37,710
I guess that's what's
meant by being in love.

116
00:09:45,390 --> 00:09:49,020
I haven't asked the things you
probably thought I would...

117
00:09:49,260 --> 00:09:53,860
...so I expect you to be understanding
about what I have to tell you.

118
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,230
What?

119
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,030
You're going to reproach me. I know
you're bound to, but before you do...

120
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:03,470
...consider the fact that you left.
I stayed and struggled.

121
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,480
You came to New Orleans. I stayed at
Belle Reve trying to hold it together.

122
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,150
I'm not meaning to reproach you...

123
00:10:11,350 --> 00:10:13,650
...but all the burden descended on me!

124
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:15,380
It was best I came here.

125
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:20,320
But you abandoned Belle Reve, not I.
I stayed and almost died for it!

126
00:10:20,530 --> 00:10:23,980
- Tell me what happened!
- I knew you'd take this attitude!

127
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,490
About what? Please!

128
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,160
The loss.

129
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,170
The loss.

130
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,170
Belle Reve? Lost, is it?

131
00:10:38,710 --> 00:10:39,840
Yes.

132
00:10:40,710 --> 00:10:43,510
But how did it go? What happened?

133
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,780
You're a fine one to ask me how it went!

134
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:50,580
To stand there accusing me of it!
I won't stand it!

135
00:10:58,330 --> 00:11:02,430
I! I took the blows on
my face and my body!

136
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:06,870
All of those deaths!
The long parade to the graveyard.

137
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:08,700
Father, Mother...

138
00:11:08,970 --> 00:11:11,310
...Margaret, that dreadful way.

139
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,810
You just came home for the funerals.

140
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:16,710
And funerals are pretty
compared to deaths.

141
00:11:16,910 --> 00:11:20,320
How'd you think all that
dying was paid for?

142
00:11:20,490 --> 00:11:22,610
Death is expensive, Miss Stella.

143
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:26,120
And l, from my pitiful
salary at the school.

144
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:28,450
Yes, accuse me.

145
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:31,320
Stare at me, thinking
I let the place go!

146
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:35,230
I let the place go! Where were you?
In there with your Polack!

147
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,900
That's enough!

148
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:39,130
Oh, Stella, Stella, you're crying!

149
00:11:39,370 --> 00:11:40,960
Does that surprise you?

150
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:45,070
We playing at your house?

151
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:47,340
No, my mother's still sick.

152
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:49,980
- You bring the beer.
- Break it up down there.

153
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:53,740
- I made spaghetti and ate it myself!
- Now, honey...

154
00:11:53,950 --> 00:11:55,920
...told you we were playing.

155
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,080
You never phoned me once.

156
00:12:00,290 --> 00:12:03,590
- I told you at breakfast.
- Why don't you just get in here.

157
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:05,920
Do you want it in the newspapers?

158
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:26,380
You must be Stanley.

159
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:27,880
I'm Blanche.

160
00:12:28,920 --> 00:12:30,620
You're Stel's sister.

161
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:32,390
Yes.

162
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:34,120
Hi ya.

163
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:36,120
Where's the little woman?

164
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:39,030
In the bathroom.

165
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:44,390
Where you from, Blanche?

166
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,900
I live in Auriol.

167
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:48,540
Auriol.

168
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:52,800
Oh, yeah, that's right.
Auriol, that's not my territory.

169
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,310
Liquor goes fast in the hot weather.

170
00:12:56,950 --> 00:12:57,970
Want a shot?

171
00:12:58,180 --> 00:13:00,150
No, I rarely touch it.

172
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:05,220
There's some people that rarely
touch it, but it touches them often.

173
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,160
You mind if I make myself comfortable?

174
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,990
Please do.

175
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,830
" Be comfortable," that's my motto.

176
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:20,490
Mine too. It's hard to stay
looking fresh in hot weather.

177
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,230
I haven't washed or even powdered and...

178
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:25,170
...here you are.

179
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,510
You must be careful sitting
in damp things. Catch cold.

180
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:32,580
Especially when you been
exercising hard, like bowling.

181
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:36,680
What do you do? You're a teacher?

182
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:37,580
Yes.

183
00:13:37,790 --> 00:13:38,760
What subject?

184
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:40,750
English.

185
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:43,760
I never was a very good English student.

186
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:48,360
- How long you here for?
- I don't know yet.

187
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:50,370
Shacking up here?

188
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:54,360
I will if it's not inconvenient for you.

189
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:56,260
Good.

190
00:13:59,910 --> 00:14:01,780
Traveling wears me out.

191
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:04,050
Take it easy.

192
00:14:04,250 --> 00:14:05,270
What's that?

193
00:14:07,750 --> 00:14:09,280
Those cats.

194
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,560
What'd you do, fall asleep in there?

195
00:14:22,770 --> 00:14:26,070
I guess I'll strike you as
being the unrefined type.

196
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:31,230
Stella's spoke a good deal about you.

197
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:35,000
She said you were married once.

198
00:14:35,450 --> 00:14:37,510
Said you were married once.

199
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:39,910
Said you were married once.

200
00:14:40,350 --> 00:14:41,410
Yes.

201
00:14:42,620 --> 00:14:44,250
When I was quite young.

202
00:14:44,620 --> 00:14:46,090
What happened?

203
00:14:46,290 --> 00:14:47,420
What happened?

204
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,590
The boy...

205
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:51,160
The boy died.

206
00:15:07,810 --> 00:15:09,280
I'm afraid...

207
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:12,450
...I'm going to be sick.

208
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:16,510
Fresh fish!

209
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:18,690
Fish!

210
00:15:18,890 --> 00:15:20,580
Fresh fish!

211
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:33,700
Looks like she's fixing to stay awhile.

212
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,600
So, we playing tonight?

213
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:37,270
Maybe we ought to...

214
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,440
Don't figure no maybes.

215
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:41,110
- Put it down.
- Right.

216
00:15:41,410 --> 00:15:43,110
Shall I get the other one?

217
00:15:43,810 --> 00:15:45,440
Thanks, darling.

218
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,380
Is Stanley back with my trunk?

219
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,550
Yes.

220
00:15:49,750 --> 00:15:52,380
Honey? Will you get my blue net for me?

221
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:53,960
All right.

222
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,630
It was good of Stanley to get my trunk.

223
00:15:56,830 --> 00:15:58,800
He was glad to do it.

224
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,630
- I'll see you later.
- Just don't forget.

225
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:05,230
I'm taking Blanche to Galatoire's
for supper, then to a show...

226
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,130
...because it's poker night.

227
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:10,070
How about my supper?
I'm not going to Galatoire's.

228
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,570
I put you a cold plate on ice.

229
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:16,800
We'll be back after the party's over
as I'm not sure how'll she'll take it.

230
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,480
Isn't that just dandy.

231
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,650
You better give me some money.

232
00:16:20,950 --> 00:16:22,250
Where is she?

233
00:16:22,450 --> 00:16:27,250
She's soaking in a hot tub to quiet
her nerves. She's terribly upset.

234
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,760
Over what?

235
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:31,930
She's been through an ordeal.
We lost Belle Reve.

236
00:16:32,860 --> 00:16:35,160
What, the place in the country?

237
00:16:35,470 --> 00:16:36,330
How?

238
00:16:36,530 --> 00:16:38,330
It had to be sacrificed.

239
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:42,100
When she comes in, say something
nice about her appearance.

240
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:43,600
And...

241
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,170
...don't mention the baby.

242
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:48,680
I haven't told her.
I'm waiting till she calms down.

243
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:52,610
And try to understand her
and be nice to her, honey.

244
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:55,340
She wasn't expecting such a place.

245
00:16:55,550 --> 00:16:58,610
I tried to gloss things over
a little in my letters.

246
00:16:58,820 --> 00:17:02,020
Admire her dress.
Tell her she looks wonderful.

247
00:17:02,230 --> 00:17:04,960
It's important to Blanche,
her little weakness.

248
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,460
Okay, I get the idea, but...

249
00:17:07,830 --> 00:17:11,860
...let's just skip back to where
you said the place was disposed of.

250
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:15,640
How about a few more
details on that subject.

251
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:19,540
It's best not to talk about
it until she's calmed down.

252
00:17:19,910 --> 00:17:23,970
Is that the deal? Blanche can't
be annoyed with details right now?

253
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:26,480
You saw how she was last night.

254
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,880
I saw how she was. Now,
let's see the bill of sale.

255
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:31,650
I haven't seen any.

256
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:35,380
She didn't show you no papers,
no deed nor nothing?

257
00:17:35,590 --> 00:17:37,560
It seemed like it wasn't sold.

258
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,890
Was it given away to charity?

259
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,230
- She'll hear you.
- I don't care. Let's see the papers.

260
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:49,340
There weren't any. She didn't show
any papers. I don't care about papers.

261
00:17:49,540 --> 00:17:53,170
Wait, listen. Have you
heard of the Napoleonic code?

262
00:17:53,380 --> 00:17:56,350
No, I haven't heard of
the Napoleonic code.

263
00:17:56,550 --> 00:17:59,180
Let me enlighten you on a point or two.

264
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:03,510
We got here in Louisiana what's
known as the Napoleonic Code:

265
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:08,420
That what belongs to the wife, belongs
to the husband, and vice versa.

266
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,250
Will you listen?

267
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,520
For example, if I had that property...

268
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:14,860
My head is swimming.

269
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,270
Well, all right, then.

270
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:23,200
When she's done soaking in the tub...

271
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:26,870
...I'll inquire if she
is acquainted with it.

272
00:18:27,310 --> 00:18:29,280
Stanley! Don't be so silly!

273
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:31,450
It looks like you were swindled.

274
00:18:31,650 --> 00:18:36,280
And, under the Napoleonic Code, I
got swindled too. I don't like that.

275
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:40,460
You've no idea how
ridiculous you're being...

276
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:42,960
...when you suggest my sister, or...

277
00:18:43,160 --> 00:18:46,060
...anyone else of our family,
could have swindled anyone...

278
00:18:46,260 --> 00:18:49,390
Come on, where's the money
if the place was sold?

279
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,070
Not sold! Lost! Lost!

280
00:18:52,670 --> 00:18:53,800
Come here.

281
00:18:54,170 --> 00:18:58,570
Open your eyes to this stuff here?
She got this out of a teacher's pay?

282
00:18:58,780 --> 00:19:00,070
Oh, hush!

283
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:03,970
Look at these fine feathers and
furs that she preens herself in.

284
00:19:04,180 --> 00:19:07,150
What is this article?
A solid-gold dress!

285
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:10,810
And this one here.
And what is that, a fox-piece?

286
00:19:11,020 --> 00:19:15,750
A genuine fur-fox, a half a mile long!
Where are your fox-pieces?

287
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:19,420
Bushy, snow-white ones, no less!
Where are your white fox furs?

288
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:23,500
Those are inexpensive furs
Blanche has had a long time.

289
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:28,100
An acquaintance deals in these items
and he's going to appraise this.

290
00:19:28,310 --> 00:19:29,930
Don't be an idiot!

291
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:34,010
I'll bet you there's $1000 invested in this stuff.

292
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,450
Now, is that the treasure
chest of a pirate?

293
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:40,450
That's pearls. Ropes of them.

294
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:43,790
Is your sister a deep-sea diver?

295
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:46,460
Where're your pearls and gold bracelets?

296
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:48,450
Be still.

297
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,630
A diamond crown for an empress.

298
00:19:50,830 --> 00:19:54,530
A rhinestone tiara she
wore to a costume ball.

299
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:56,030
What is rhinestone?

300
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,130
Next door to glass.

301
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,710
An acquaintance works in a jewelry store.
He'll come to make an appraisal.

302
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,540
Here's your plantation.

303
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:09,210
You're being stupid and horrid!

304
00:20:09,410 --> 00:20:12,640
You stay away from these
things before she comes out!

305
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:15,550
The Kowalskis and DuBois got
a different notion on this.

306
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:19,480
Indeed they have, thank heavens.
I'm going outside.

307
00:20:20,360 --> 00:20:21,380
Go ahead.

308
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:27,330
Come out with me while
Blanche is getting dressed.

309
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,160
Since when are you giving me orders?

310
00:20:30,370 --> 00:20:33,340
Are you going to stay
here and insult her?

311
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:35,570
You bet your life I'm staying.

312
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,520
Hello, Stanley.

313
00:20:55,390 --> 00:20:59,690
Here I am, freshly bathed and scented
and feeling like a new person.

314
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:01,360
That's good.

315
00:21:02,070 --> 00:21:06,370
Will you excuse me while I
put on my pretty new dress?

316
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:08,030
Go ahead.

317
00:21:43,670 --> 00:21:46,730
I understand there's to be
a card party here tonight...

318
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:49,810
...to which we ladies are
cordially not invited.

319
00:21:50,280 --> 00:21:51,580
That's right.

320
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,480
Where is Stella?

321
00:21:55,350 --> 00:21:57,410
She's out on the porch.

322
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:06,760
I'm going to ask a favor of you soon.

323
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,320
What's that going to be, I wonder?

324
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,830
Some buttons in back.

325
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,510
You may enter.

326
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,770
How do I look?

327
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:22,440
You look okay.

328
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:25,170
Many thanks. Now, the buttons.

329
00:22:30,550 --> 00:22:32,450
I can't do no more with them.

330
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,790
You men with your big, clumsy fingers.

331
00:22:34,990 --> 00:22:36,690
May I have a drag?

332
00:22:36,890 --> 00:22:39,290
- Have one for yourself.
- Thank you.

333
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:42,620
It looks like my trunk has exploded.

334
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:45,030
Me and Stella helped you unpack.

335
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:48,800
You did a fast and thorough job of it.

336
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:52,370
It looks like you've raided
some stylish shops in Paris.

337
00:22:52,580 --> 00:22:54,370
Clothes are my passion.

338
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:56,640
How much do furs like that cost?

339
00:22:56,850 --> 00:22:59,040
These were a tribute from an admirer.

340
00:22:59,250 --> 00:23:00,980
He had a lot of admiration.

341
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:03,980
In my youth I excited some
admiration, but look at me now.

342
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:07,980
Will you think it's possible that
I was once considered attractive?

343
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,830
Your looks are okay.

344
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,890
- I was fishing for a compliment.
- I don't go in for that.

345
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,230
- What?
- Compliments to women on their looks.

346
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:19,730
Every dame knows if she's good
looking without being told.

347
00:23:20,040 --> 00:23:23,500
Some give themselves credit
for more than they've got.

348
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:26,900
I once went out with a dame who
said, "I'm the glamorous type."

349
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:30,080
She says, "I'm the glamorous type."
I says, "So what?"

350
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,250
What did she say then?

351
00:23:32,450 --> 00:23:34,420
Nothing. It shut her up.

352
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,350
Did it end the romance?

353
00:23:36,550 --> 00:23:39,180
It ended the conversation.
That was all.

354
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:44,030
Some men are took in by this Hollywood
glamour stuff, and some men just aren't.

355
00:23:44,230 --> 00:23:46,920
- And you're in the 2nd category.
- That's right.

356
00:23:47,130 --> 00:23:50,930
- I can't imagine a woman bewitching you.
- That's right.

357
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:55,200
You're simple, straightforward
and honest. A bit on the...

358
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:58,200
...primitive side. To interest
you a woman would have to...

359
00:23:58,410 --> 00:24:00,380
She must lay the cards on the table.

360
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:03,210
I never did care for wishy-washy people.

361
00:24:03,410 --> 00:24:06,040
When I saw you last
night I said to myself:

362
00:24:06,250 --> 00:24:09,550
"My sister has married a man."
That was all I could tell...

363
00:24:09,750 --> 00:24:12,050
How about cutting the re-bop?!

364
00:24:14,590 --> 00:24:16,790
Come with me while Blanche dresses.

365
00:24:16,990 --> 00:24:18,390
- I'm done.
- Come out.

366
00:24:18,600 --> 00:24:21,120
- Your sister and I are chatting.
- Do me a favor.

367
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:24,230
Go to the store and get me a
lemon coke with chipped ice.

368
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:27,130
Will you do that for me, sweetie?
Please?

369
00:24:29,010 --> 00:24:30,230
All right.

370
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,810
The poor thing was listening to us.

371
00:24:38,020 --> 00:24:41,580
I have an idea she doesn't
understand you as well as I do.

372
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:46,750
All right, let us proceed
without any more digression.

373
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:51,830
I'm ready to answer all questions.
I've nothing to hide. What is it?

374
00:24:53,530 --> 00:24:58,160
In the state of Louisiana we've got
what's known as the Napoleonic Code.

375
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:02,600
According to which that what belongs
to the wife belongs to her husband.

376
00:25:02,810 --> 00:25:05,170
You have an impressive judicial air.

377
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:09,280
If you weren't my wife's sister,
I'd get ideas about you.

378
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:12,110
Such as what?

379
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,010
Don't play so dumb. You know what.

380
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:17,680
All right.

381
00:25:17,990 --> 00:25:19,460
Cards on the table.

382
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:24,290
I know I fib a good deal.
But a woman's charm is 50º% º illusion.

383
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,970
But when a thing is important,
I tell the truth.

384
00:25:29,170 --> 00:25:30,630
This is the truth:

385
00:25:30,830 --> 00:25:32,360
I never cheated my sister...

386
00:25:32,570 --> 00:25:36,030
...or you, or anyone else on
earth as long as I lived!

387
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:37,800
Where are the papers?

388
00:25:38,010 --> 00:25:40,310
Everything I own is in that trunk.

389
00:25:43,350 --> 00:25:46,980
What are you thinking? What's in
that little boy's mind of yours?

390
00:25:47,180 --> 00:25:49,550
I'll do it, it'll be faster and simpler.

391
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,050
I keep my papers in this tin box.

392
00:25:52,260 --> 00:25:53,810
What are those underneath?

393
00:25:56,430 --> 00:25:57,980
Some love letters...

394
00:25:58,530 --> 00:26:00,550
...yellowing with antiquity.

395
00:26:01,030 --> 00:26:04,000
- All from one boy. Give them to me!
- I'll just look.

396
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,170
- Your touch insults them.
- Don't pull that stuff!

397
00:26:07,540 --> 00:26:11,170
Now that you've touched
them, I'll burn them!

398
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:13,340
What are they?

399
00:26:15,050 --> 00:26:17,670
Poems... the dead boy wrote.

400
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,240
I hurt him the way that you would
like to hurt me, but you can't.

401
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:27,010
I'm no longer young and vulnerable.
My young husband was and I...

402
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:30,090
Never mind about that.

403
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,190
Give them back to me.

404
00:26:39,070 --> 00:26:41,540
What'd you mean, you have to burn them?

405
00:26:42,310 --> 00:26:43,710
I'm sorry.

406
00:26:44,910 --> 00:26:47,270
I must have lost my head for a moment.

407
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:51,380
Everyone has something they
won't let others touch...

408
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:54,040
...because of their intimate nature.

409
00:27:01,090 --> 00:27:02,720
Ambler and Ambler!

410
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:04,560
Crabtree!

411
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,890
Ambler and Ambler!

412
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,070
- What's Ambler and Ambler?
- A firm that made loans on the place.

413
00:27:10,270 --> 00:27:12,960
- It was lost on a mortgage?
- It must have been.

414
00:27:13,170 --> 00:27:15,970
I don't want no ifs, ands, or buts!
Where's the rest?

415
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:20,970
Thousands of papers, stretching back
over centuries, affect Belle Reve.

416
00:27:21,180 --> 00:27:25,310
As piece by piece our improvident
grandfathers exchanged the land...

417
00:27:25,520 --> 00:27:28,250
...for their epic debauches,
to put it mildly.

418
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:31,480
Finally all that was left,
and Stella can verify it...

419
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:36,420
...was the house itself, and 20 acres
of ground including a graveyard...

420
00:27:36,790 --> 00:27:40,920
...to which now all but
Stella and I have retreated.

421
00:27:41,370 --> 00:27:43,160
Here they are, all of them.

422
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:44,490
All papers.

423
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:48,600
I hereby endow you with them.
Peruse them, commit them to memory.

424
00:27:48,810 --> 00:27:51,170
It's wonderfully fitting
that Belle Reve...

425
00:27:51,380 --> 00:27:55,280
...should be this bunch of
papers in big, capable hands.

426
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:00,850
I wonder if Stella's back with my coke?

427
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,460
I got a lawyer acquaintance,
we'll straighten this out.

428
00:28:06,160 --> 00:28:09,610
Present them to him with
a box of aspirin tablets.

429
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:13,130
Under the Napoleonic Code...

430
00:28:13,330 --> 00:28:16,630
...a man has to take an
interest in his wife's affairs.

431
00:28:16,830 --> 00:28:19,360
Especially now that she's having a baby.

432
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:27,370
Stella's having a baby?

433
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:34,880
I didn't know she was having a baby.

434
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:45,160
Oh, Stella for a star!

435
00:28:45,700 --> 00:28:48,060
How lovely to have a baby!

436
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:51,160
Everything's all right.

437
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:55,500
We thrashed it out. I feel shaky,
but I handled it nicely.

438
00:28:55,710 --> 00:28:59,660
I treated it as a joke. Laughed,
called him a boy and flirted.

439
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:02,340
Yes, I was flirting with your husband.

440
00:29:02,550 --> 00:29:05,070
The guests are arriving for the party.

441
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,530
I'm sorry he did that to you.

442
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:19,920
I guess he's just not the type
that goes for jasmine perfume.

443
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,430
Maybe he's what we need to mix with
our blood since we've lost Belle Reve...

444
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,930
...and have to go on without
Belle Reve to protect us.

445
00:29:30,570 --> 00:29:32,540
How pretty the sky is!

446
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:36,610
I ought to go there on a
rocket that never comes down.

447
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,040
Which way do we go now?

448
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:40,550
This way?

449
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,790
No, honey, this way.

450
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:46,220
The blind are leading the blind.

451
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,390
Red hots!

452
00:30:07,510 --> 00:30:09,640
Go upstairs and tell her to stop that.

453
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:12,310
If I go up, I won't come down.
Forget it.

454
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:16,480
Remember when she poured boiling
water through the floor cracks?

455
00:30:29,130 --> 00:30:31,600
- I gotta go home soon.
- What do you say?

456
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:35,170
- No, I'm out.
- Every time you win a pot you're out!

457
00:30:35,370 --> 00:30:37,930
My mother doesn't sleep
until I come home.

458
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,440
What do you say?

459
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,270
I'm going to wash up.

460
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:49,950
You tell them guys the
kettle's on the stove!

461
00:30:50,150 --> 00:30:52,350
I'm going to break up the game.

462
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,780
Wait.

463
00:30:57,990 --> 00:31:01,860
Let me powder. I feel hot and
frazzled. Do I look done-in?

464
00:31:02,070 --> 00:31:03,690
You look fresh as a daisy.

465
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:06,300
One that's been picked a few days.

466
00:31:07,170 --> 00:31:10,700
Why don't somebody go to the
Chinaman's and bring back chop suey?

467
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:14,710
- When I'm losing, you want to eat.
- I see you are still at it.

468
00:31:14,910 --> 00:31:16,810
- Where've you been?
- We went to a show.

469
00:31:17,010 --> 00:31:19,710
This is Mr. Gonzales and Mr. Hubbell.

470
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,820
Hello. Please, don't get up.

471
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:24,210
No one's getting up, don't worry.

472
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,550
Poker's fascinating. Could I kibitz?

473
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:27,880
You could not!

474
00:31:28,090 --> 00:31:30,220
Why don't you go up to Eunice's?

475
00:31:30,430 --> 00:31:33,560
- How long will you play?
- Till we're ready to quit!

476
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,990
- Wish you'd quit after the next hand.

477
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:38,330
Hey, that's my coat!

478
00:31:40,100 --> 00:31:41,900
That's not fun, Stanley.

479
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:47,670
Makes me mad when he does
that in front of people.

480
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:50,000
- I think I will bathe.
- Again?

481
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,680
My nerves are in knots. Is it occupied?

482
00:31:52,880 --> 00:31:54,250
I don't know.

483
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:55,840
Good evening.

484
00:31:56,050 --> 00:31:57,080
Hello.

485
00:31:57,450 --> 00:32:01,360
This is Harold Mitchell.
This is my sister, Blanche DuBois.

486
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:04,030
- How do you do?
- How do you do, Miss DuBois?

487
00:32:04,230 --> 00:32:05,520
How's your mother?

488
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:09,600
She's about the same, thanks.
She appreciated that custard.

489
00:32:10,730 --> 00:32:12,430
Excuse me, please.

490
00:32:13,740 --> 00:32:14,760
Excuse me.

491
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:28,870
- That one seems superior to the others.
- Does he?

492
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,210
He had a sort of sensitive look.

493
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:32,950
His mother's sick.

494
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,560
Is he married?

495
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:37,220
Is he a wolf?

496
00:32:37,430 --> 00:32:38,720
Why, Blanche!

497
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,730
- No, I don't think he would be.
- What does he do?

498
00:32:42,930 --> 00:32:46,060
He's on the precision bench in
the spare parts department...

499
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,290
...the plant Stanley travels for.

500
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:50,300
Is that something much?

501
00:32:50,940 --> 00:32:53,740
Stanley's the only one
likely to get anywhere.

502
00:32:53,940 --> 00:32:55,410
Flush, win!

503
00:32:57,850 --> 00:33:00,320
Blanche, you're standing in the light!

504
00:33:01,520 --> 00:33:03,320
Am I? Gracious!

505
00:33:04,950 --> 00:33:06,580
You should see their wives!

506
00:33:06,790 --> 00:33:09,420
I can imagine. Big,
beefy things, I suppose.

507
00:33:09,630 --> 00:33:11,590
You know that one upstairs?

508
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:19,990
Hey, you hens! Cut out
that cackling in there!

509
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,600
You can't hear us!

510
00:33:21,810 --> 00:33:24,170
You can hear me and I said, hush up!

511
00:33:27,210 --> 00:33:30,770
This is my house and I'll
talk as much as I want to!

512
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:33,010
Don't start a row.

513
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:35,120
He's half-drunk.

514
00:33:35,320 --> 00:33:37,010
I'll be out in a minute.

515
00:33:41,660 --> 00:33:42,520
50 cents.

516
00:33:42,730 --> 00:33:44,630
All right. See you.

517
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:49,290
Well, Steve?

518
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:50,470
I'm out.

519
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:51,630
Two bucks.

520
00:34:02,510 --> 00:34:03,880
What do you say?

521
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,710
Come on, are you in?

522
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,640
I'm out!

523
00:34:09,850 --> 00:34:11,550
Who turned that on in there?

524
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:14,310
I did. Do you mind?

525
00:34:14,520 --> 00:34:17,220
- Turn it off!
- Let the girls have music.

526
00:34:17,430 --> 00:34:18,550
Sounds good.

527
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,500
There you are!

528
00:34:28,710 --> 00:34:31,070
- I didn't hear you name it!
- Didn't I name it?

529
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:33,110
- I wasn't listening.
- What were you doing?

530
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,000
- Looking through the drapes.
- I wasn't.

531
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,840
We're dealing this hand over again.
Play cards, or quit.

532
00:34:40,050 --> 00:34:41,240
Deal me out!

533
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,350
This game'll be Spit in the Ocean.

534
00:34:56,070 --> 00:34:57,090
Hello.

535
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:02,760
Excuse me.

536
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:06,430
The little boy's room
is occupied right now.

537
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,700
Excuse me.

538
00:35:08,910 --> 00:35:10,440
Have you got any cigs?

539
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,940
Sure.

540
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,040
What a pretty case.

541
00:35:16,590 --> 00:35:17,710
Silver?

542
00:35:18,590 --> 00:35:22,390
- Yes. Read the inscription.
- There is an inscription.

543
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:24,620
Why, I can't make it out.

544
00:35:28,830 --> 00:35:31,230
"And if God choose...

545
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:36,240
...I shall but love thee
better after death."

546
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:39,140
That's from my favorite
sonnet by Mrs. Browning.

547
00:35:39,510 --> 00:35:41,410
- You know it!
- Certainly.

548
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:44,580
There's a story connected
with this inscription.

549
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,980
A romance?

550
00:35:46,180 --> 00:35:48,410
A sad one. The girl's dead now.

551
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,910
She knew she was dying when she
give me this. Strange, sweet girl.

552
00:35:55,460 --> 00:35:57,590
She must have been very fond of you.

553
00:35:57,790 --> 00:36:00,660
Sick people have deep,
sincere attachments.

554
00:36:00,860 --> 00:36:01,920
They do.

555
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:05,830
- Sorrow makes for sincerity, I think.
- It brings it out.

556
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:09,770
The little there is belongs to
people who have known sorrow.

557
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,170
- I believe you're right.
- I'm positive.

558
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:16,110
Deal me out. I'm talking to Miss...

559
00:36:18,010 --> 00:36:19,210
DuBois.

560
00:36:21,750 --> 00:36:24,150
It's a French name, meaning, "woods."

561
00:36:24,350 --> 00:36:27,650
And Blanche means "white." So the
two together mean, "white woods."

562
00:36:27,860 --> 00:36:31,420
Like an orchard in spring.
You can remember it by that...

563
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:32,990
...if you care to.

564
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,990
You are Stella's sister, are you not?

565
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,330
Stella's my precious little sister.

566
00:36:38,530 --> 00:36:41,830
I call her "little" though
she's older than I am.

567
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:45,940
Just slightly. Less than a year.

568
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,610
- Will you do something for me?
- Yes. What?

569
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:52,440
I bought this adorable paper
lantern at a Chinese shop.

570
00:36:52,650 --> 00:36:54,670
Put it over the light bulb, will you?

571
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:56,350
I'd be glad to.

572
00:36:56,550 --> 00:37:00,450
I can't stand a naked light bulb
anymore than I can a rude remark...

573
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,350
...or a vulgar action.

574
00:37:02,790 --> 00:37:06,130
I guess we strike you as
being a pretty rough bunch.

575
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:09,030
I'm very adaptable...

576
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:12,030
...to circumstances.
- That's a good way to be.

577
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,640
- You're not...
- Married? Oh, no, no!

578
00:37:18,010 --> 00:37:19,770
I'm an old-maid teacher.

579
00:37:20,010 --> 00:37:23,470
You may be a teacher, but you're
certainly not an old maid.

580
00:37:24,910 --> 00:37:26,780
Why, thank you, sir.

581
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:29,210
I appreciate your gallantry.

582
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,780
So you're in the teaching profession?

583
00:37:37,030 --> 00:37:38,790
Grade school or high school?

584
00:37:39,030 --> 00:37:40,290
Coming!

585
00:37:40,530 --> 00:37:44,490
Gracious, what lung power!
I teach high school in Auriol.

586
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:47,160
What subject do you teach?

587
00:37:47,340 --> 00:37:48,300
Guess.

588
00:37:48,540 --> 00:37:51,560
I bet you teach art or music.

589
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:54,680
Of course, I could be wrong.

590
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:56,240
You might teach math.

591
00:37:56,450 --> 00:37:58,740
Never math, sir. Never math.

592
00:37:58,950 --> 00:38:03,680
I have the misfortune of
being an English instructor.

593
00:38:04,050 --> 00:38:07,920
I try to instill a bunch of bobby-
soxers and drugstore Romeos...

594
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:11,820
...with a reverence for
Hawthorne and Whitman and Poe.

595
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,530
I bet they are more
interested in other things.

596
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:16,530
How very right you are.

597
00:38:16,730 --> 00:38:20,530
Their literary heritage is not
what they treasure above all.

598
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:22,260
But they're sweet things.

599
00:38:22,470 --> 00:38:27,340
In spring, it's touching to see them
making their first discovery of love.

600
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:30,540
As if nobody had ever known it...

601
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,770
...before.

602
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,210
Sorry.

603
00:38:36,490 --> 00:38:37,850
Excuse me!

604
00:38:38,090 --> 00:38:39,550
Have you finished?

605
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,780
Oh, yes.

606
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:43,860
- I have.
- Wait. I'll turn on the radio.

607
00:38:46,260 --> 00:38:48,060
Turn on the light now.

608
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh, look!

609
00:38:51,330 --> 00:38:53,560
We've made enchantment.

610
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:06,580
3 bullets, moustache!

611
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:08,480
Straight! I got you!

612
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:14,150
- What are you doing?
- Let me alone!

613
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:17,390
Drunk! You animal thing!

614
00:39:17,930 --> 00:39:19,090
Get out!

615
00:39:19,300 --> 00:39:20,260
Get out!

616
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,490
- What're you doing?
- Get out.

617
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:25,760
My sister's going to have a baby!

618
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,500
Lunacy! Complete lunacy!

619
00:39:31,810 --> 00:39:33,610
You come up to my place.

620
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:35,510
Did he hurt you?

621
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,770
- Make him go away!
- Poker shouldn't be played around women.

622
00:39:41,050 --> 00:39:43,180
Take it easy, will you?

623
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:50,190
Get him in that shower!

624
00:39:50,390 --> 00:39:51,190
Come on.

625
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:53,120
Get his feet, will you?

626
00:39:53,330 --> 00:39:55,300
Grab his feet. Come on.

627
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:58,370
Come on, get under there. Stay.

628
00:39:59,170 --> 00:40:00,530
Get under there.

629
00:40:00,740 --> 00:40:03,200
Get him a little higher, that's right.

630
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,440
- How you feel?
- There you are.

631
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:07,810
Wake up.

632
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:10,540
We should remove his clothes.

633
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:13,540
What're you doing?!

634
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:22,720
Poker should not be played
around women!

635
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,720
Where's Steve?

636
00:40:27,930 --> 00:40:29,450
Take it easy!

637
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:54,580
Honey?

638
00:41:01,130 --> 00:41:02,690
Where are you?

639
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,000
Hey, baby!

640
00:41:29,490 --> 00:41:32,520
You can sleep over here.
Blanche can have Steve's place.

641
00:41:32,760 --> 00:41:35,630
He ain't coming home if he
knows what's good for him.

642
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:43,900
Look! She ain't coming down and she
ain't going to talk to you neither.

643
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:57,050
Stop hollering and go to bed.

644
00:41:57,290 --> 00:41:59,050
I want my girl.

645
00:41:59,290 --> 00:42:01,760
Shut up, or you'll get the law on you.

646
00:42:01,960 --> 00:42:05,920
You can't beat up a woman then
call her back. She ain't coming.

647
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,160
- They'll haul you in like last time!
- I want my girl down here.

648
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:11,920
You stinker!

649
00:42:34,990 --> 00:42:36,790
I wouldn't mix in this!

650
00:43:38,290 --> 00:43:40,350
Please, don't ever leave me, baby.

651
00:43:57,310 --> 00:43:58,670
Come back!

652
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,900
Miss DuBois?

653
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,470
All quiet along the Potomac now?

654
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,810
She ran down and went back in with him.

655
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:39,640
- Sure, she did.
- I'm terrified.

656
00:44:39,850 --> 00:44:42,480
Don't be. They're
crazy about each other.

657
00:44:42,690 --> 00:44:45,590
- Shame it happened your first day.
- Violence is so...

658
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,220
Sit down and have a cigarette with me.

659
00:44:48,460 --> 00:44:50,820
Why, I'm not properly dressed.

660
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:52,930
That doesn't matter here.

661
00:44:55,130 --> 00:44:57,600
Such a pretty silver case.

662
00:44:57,770 --> 00:45:00,170
I showed you the inscription, didn't I?

663
00:45:07,280 --> 00:45:08,610
There's so much...

664
00:45:09,210 --> 00:45:11,240
...so much confusion in the world.

665
00:45:14,220 --> 00:45:16,240
Thank you for being so kind.

666
00:45:16,990 --> 00:45:18,950
I need kindness now.

667
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,020
Bananas!

668
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:32,630
Bananas!

669
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:51,780
Oh, my baby. My baby sister!

670
00:45:52,320 --> 00:45:54,790
- What's the matter with you?
- He's left?

671
00:45:56,090 --> 00:45:59,390
- Will he be back?
- He's getting the car greased.

672
00:45:59,600 --> 00:46:03,220
I've been half-crazy.
How could you come back last night?

673
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:07,390
Please, he was as good as
a lamb when I came back.

674
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:09,730
He's really very ashamed of himself.

675
00:46:10,440 --> 00:46:12,810
And that makes it all right?

676
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:16,910
Stanley's always smashed things.

677
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,420
On our wedding night, as
soon as we came in here...

678
00:46:21,050 --> 00:46:25,510
...he snatched off my slipper and
rushed around smashing light bulbs.

679
00:46:26,120 --> 00:46:27,320
He did what?

680
00:46:29,230 --> 00:46:32,320
He smashed all the light bulbs
with the heel of my slipper.

681
00:46:32,560 --> 00:46:34,830
And you let him, didn't run?

682
00:46:36,370 --> 00:46:38,530
I was sort of thrilled by it.

683
00:46:40,570 --> 00:46:42,540
Eunice and you had breakfast?

684
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:45,440
Do you suppose I wanted any breakfast?

685
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:48,610
You're so matter of fact
about it all, Stella.

686
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,040
Well, what other can I be?

687
00:46:51,650 --> 00:46:54,120
He took the radio to get it fixed.

688
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:57,950
It didn't land on the pavement
so only one tube smashed.

689
00:46:58,150 --> 00:47:01,710
- And you stand there smiling?
- What should I do?

690
00:47:01,890 --> 00:47:05,290
- Face the facts.
- What are they, in your opinion?

691
00:47:05,490 --> 00:47:07,790
You're married to a madman.

692
00:47:08,500 --> 00:47:11,060
I have a plan for us
both to get out of here.

693
00:47:11,270 --> 00:47:14,630
Stop taking it for granted
that I want to get out.

694
00:47:14,840 --> 00:47:18,070
I take for granted you have
sufficient memory of Belle Reve...

695
00:47:18,270 --> 00:47:22,070
...to find it impossible to live here.
- You take too much for granted.

696
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:23,870
I can't believe you.

697
00:47:24,110 --> 00:47:25,810
I understand how it happened.

698
00:47:26,020 --> 00:47:28,750
You saw him first in uniform,
an officer, not here...

699
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:30,820
That doesn't make any difference.

700
00:47:31,290 --> 00:47:34,980
We're talking about his desire.
His brutal desire.

701
00:47:35,290 --> 00:47:38,590
The name of that streetcar that
bangs through the quarter.

702
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:40,890
Up one narrow street and down another.

703
00:47:41,130 --> 00:47:43,600
Have you ever ridden on that streetcar?

704
00:47:46,700 --> 00:47:48,400
It brought me here...

705
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:51,100
...where I'm not wanted.

706
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:53,100
Where I'm ashamed to be.

707
00:47:53,310 --> 00:47:56,400
Isn't your superior attitude
a little out of place?

708
00:47:56,650 --> 00:47:58,910
- A man like that.
- I love him!

709
00:47:59,150 --> 00:48:00,910
I tremble for you.

710
00:48:01,380 --> 00:48:04,610
I can't help your trembling
if you insist on trembling.

711
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,130
May I speak plainly?

712
00:48:17,400 --> 00:48:21,030
Yes, do. Go ahead.
As plainly as you want.

713
00:48:22,170 --> 00:48:23,800
If you'll forgive me...

714
00:48:24,470 --> 00:48:25,530
...he's common.

715
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:32,210
Yes, I suppose he is.

716
00:48:32,850 --> 00:48:34,320
Suppose?

717
00:48:34,480 --> 00:48:37,650
You can't have forgotten that
much of our upbringing...

718
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:41,450
...that you suppose there's any
part of a gentleman in his nature.

719
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,450
You're hating me saying
this, aren't you?

720
00:48:45,360 --> 00:48:47,890
Go on. Say it all, Blanche.

721
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:52,960
He's like an animal.

722
00:48:53,770 --> 00:48:58,670
He has an animal's habits.
There's something subhuman about him.

723
00:48:58,870 --> 00:49:02,240
Thousands of years have passed
him by and there he is...

724
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,470
...Stanley Kowalski,
survivor of the Stone Age...

725
00:49:05,710 --> 00:49:08,680
...bearing the raw meat home
from the kill in the jungle.

726
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,980
You wait. Maybe he'll strike
you... or grunt, kiss you...

727
00:49:13,220 --> 00:49:14,990
...if kisses have been discovered.

728
00:49:15,220 --> 00:49:17,990
His poker night, you call it.
His party of apes?

729
00:49:18,730 --> 00:49:22,360
Maybe we are a long way from
being made in God's image...

730
00:49:23,130 --> 00:49:25,000
...but, Stella, my sister...

731
00:49:25,230 --> 00:49:27,760
...there's been progress since then.

732
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:30,940
Such things as art, as poetry, as music.

733
00:49:31,240 --> 00:49:36,110
In some kinds of people, some tenderer
feelings have had a little beginning...

734
00:49:36,550 --> 00:49:39,210
...that we must make
grow and cling to...

735
00:49:39,420 --> 00:49:44,110
...and hold as our flag in this march
toward whatever it is we're approaching.

736
00:49:44,320 --> 00:49:47,880
Don't, don't hang back with the brutes!

737
00:50:43,710 --> 00:50:44,770
Hi ya.

738
00:50:49,820 --> 00:50:51,580
Is Blanche back yet?

739
00:50:54,620 --> 00:50:56,180
Yeah, she's back.

740
00:50:57,630 --> 00:50:59,290
Oh, hi there, Blanche.

741
00:51:00,500 --> 00:51:02,360
Looks like you got under the car.

742
00:51:03,230 --> 00:51:07,690
That jerk mechanic down at Fritz's
doesn't know grease from 3rd base.

743
00:51:28,160 --> 00:51:30,630
Don't throw that thing at me!

744
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:32,490
I can fix things.

745
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:38,830
- Just what I gave your brother.
- I'll call the police.

746
00:51:39,670 --> 00:51:42,330
He hit me. I'm calling the police.

747
00:51:42,540 --> 00:51:43,130
You saw!

748
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,830
Your sister's friends have
stayed in the city awhile.

749
00:51:50,780 --> 00:51:52,750
Did Eunice get the police?

750
00:51:52,950 --> 00:51:56,410
- No, she's getting a drink.
- That's much more practical.

751
00:51:57,620 --> 00:52:00,250
Blanche is making us new slipcovers.

752
00:52:01,890 --> 00:52:02,910
Is she here?

753
00:52:03,130 --> 00:52:04,920
She went to the Four Deuces.

754
00:52:05,460 --> 00:52:07,430
That no-good, rotten...

755
00:52:11,970 --> 00:52:14,270
I can't find my other pair of shoes.

756
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:17,100
We cleaned in there.

757
00:52:17,310 --> 00:52:18,600
I'll get them.

758
00:52:20,140 --> 00:52:22,940
I can't find nothing
around this dump anymore.

759
00:52:28,320 --> 00:52:30,380
What sign were you born under?

760
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:31,950
What sign?

761
00:52:32,420 --> 00:52:33,950
Astrological sign.

762
00:52:34,160 --> 00:52:37,790
I bet you were born under Aries.
Aries people are forceful, dynamic.

763
00:52:37,990 --> 00:52:40,790
They dote on noise.
They love to bang things around.

764
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,690
Stanley was born five
minutes after Christmas.

765
00:52:44,600 --> 00:52:46,470
Capricorn. The goat!

766
00:52:58,850 --> 00:52:59,910
Say...

767
00:53:00,450 --> 00:53:02,970
...do you know somebody named Shaw?

768
00:53:04,620 --> 00:53:08,420
Everybody knows someone
by the name of Shaw.

769
00:53:08,960 --> 00:53:13,160
This somebody named Shaw
believes he met you in Auriol.

770
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:18,670
But I figure he must of mixed you up
with someone else because this party...

771
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:21,440
...he met at a hotel
called The Flamingo.

772
00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:25,440
I guess he does have me mixed
up with this other party.

773
00:53:25,640 --> 00:53:29,340
The Hotel Flamingo is not a
place I'd dare to be seen in.

774
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:32,110
You know it then?

775
00:53:32,280 --> 00:53:33,680
I've seen it...

776
00:53:33,880 --> 00:53:35,110
...and smelled it.

777
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,120
You must've got close to smell it.

778
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,190
The odor of cheap
perfume is penetrating.

779
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,620
You use expensive stuff?

780
00:53:44,990 --> 00:53:47,020
$12 an ounce. I'm nearly out...

781
00:53:47,230 --> 00:53:49,530
...if you want to remember...

782
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:56,530
I figure that he must
of got you mixed up.

783
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:59,540
But he goes in and out of
Auriol all the time...

784
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,770
...so he can check and
clear up any mistake.

785
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:09,380
See you at the Four Deuces.

786
00:54:09,580 --> 00:54:11,050
Don't I rate a kiss?

787
00:54:11,250 --> 00:54:13,280
Not in front of your sister.

788
00:54:22,730 --> 00:54:26,960
Don't cry. I only do that with
other girls because I love you, baby.

789
00:54:27,340 --> 00:54:28,630
It's a fact.

790
00:54:38,450 --> 00:54:40,570
You still scared of thunder?

791
00:54:41,350 --> 00:54:43,320
What've you heard about me?

792
00:54:44,790 --> 00:54:47,080
What have people been telling you...

793
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:48,410
...about me?

794
00:54:50,130 --> 00:54:51,090
Telling?

795
00:54:51,790 --> 00:54:53,420
You haven't heard any...

796
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,260
...unkind gossip about me?

797
00:54:57,570 --> 00:55:00,160
Why, no, Blanche. Of course not.

798
00:55:00,370 --> 00:55:01,430
Honey...

799
00:55:01,700 --> 00:55:04,100
...there was quite a lot of talk...

800
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,430
...in Auriol.

801
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:08,170
People talk, who cares?

802
00:55:08,380 --> 00:55:11,540
I haven't been so good
the last year or so...

803
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:14,270
...since Belle Reve began slipping away.

804
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,780
- We all do things.
- I was never hard enough.

805
00:55:18,990 --> 00:55:20,110
Soft people...

806
00:55:20,320 --> 00:55:23,780
...have got to court
the favor of hard ones.

807
00:55:24,230 --> 00:55:26,060
They must shimmer and glow.

808
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:29,060
How much longer I can turn the trick?

809
00:55:29,230 --> 00:55:31,290
It isn't enough to be soft.

810
00:55:31,500 --> 00:55:33,060
You must be soft...

811
00:55:33,240 --> 00:55:34,700
...and attractive.

812
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:36,200
And I...

813
00:55:37,010 --> 00:55:38,630
I'm fading now.

814
00:55:44,850 --> 00:55:46,580
Have you been listening to me?

815
00:55:47,620 --> 00:55:50,140
I never listen when you're being morbid.

816
00:56:00,530 --> 00:56:02,000
Is that for me?

817
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:06,000
- Not for anyone else.
- You precious lamb. Is it just a coke?

818
00:56:06,200 --> 00:56:10,000
- You want a shot in it?
- A shot never did a coke any harm.

819
00:56:10,270 --> 00:56:11,330
Let me.

820
00:56:11,540 --> 00:56:15,100
- You mustn't wait on me.
- I like to wait on you.

821
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,180
Makes it seem more like home.

822
00:56:19,150 --> 00:56:20,840
I have to admit...

823
00:56:21,950 --> 00:56:24,010
...I love to be waited on.

824
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:33,020
- Honey, what is it?
- You're so good to me and I...

825
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,930
I know you hate me to talk sentimental
but believe me, I feel more than I say.

826
00:56:38,170 --> 00:56:40,930
- I won't stay long. I promise.
- Now, Blanche.

827
00:56:41,170 --> 00:56:43,030
I'll go. I'll go soon.

828
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:46,370
I won't hang around
till he throws me out!

829
00:56:47,080 --> 00:56:50,880
- Now will you stop talking foolish?
- Watch how you pour it.

830
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:52,780
Heavens.

831
00:56:53,080 --> 00:56:54,380
Right on my...

832
00:56:54,580 --> 00:56:56,640
...pretty pink skirt.

833
00:56:56,920 --> 00:56:59,150
Use my hankie. Blot gently.

834
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,650
I know.

835
00:57:00,820 --> 00:57:01,950
Gently.

836
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:03,280
Gently.

837
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,050
Gently.

838
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:07,660
Did it stain?

839
00:57:09,930 --> 00:57:11,730
No, not a bit.

840
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:14,390
Isn't that lucky?

841
00:57:14,600 --> 00:57:17,300
Honey, why did you scream like that?

842
00:57:17,510 --> 00:57:18,800
Why?

843
00:57:20,210 --> 00:57:21,800
I don't know why.

844
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,180
Mitch is coming at seven.

845
00:57:27,350 --> 00:57:29,680
I'm nervous about our relations.

846
00:57:29,850 --> 00:57:33,080
He hasn't gotten anything
more than a good-night kiss.

847
00:57:33,290 --> 00:57:36,690
I want his respect. Men don't
want things they get easily.

848
00:57:36,860 --> 00:57:40,590
Men lose interest quickly,
especially when a girl...

849
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,920
...is over 30.

850
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:43,600
When I mentioned marriage...

851
00:57:43,800 --> 00:57:45,600
...they even forgot where I lived...

852
00:57:45,800 --> 00:57:49,260
So, you see, I haven't
informed him of my real age.

853
00:57:49,470 --> 00:57:53,340
Honey, why are you so
sensitive about your age?

854
00:57:53,540 --> 00:57:54,600
Because of...

855
00:57:54,810 --> 00:57:57,610
...hard knocks my vanity's been given.

856
00:57:57,810 --> 00:58:02,010
What I mean is, he thinks I'm sort
of prim and proper, you know.

857
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:03,940
I want to deceive him...

858
00:58:04,150 --> 00:58:07,020
...just enough to make him want me.

859
00:58:08,060 --> 00:58:09,350
Darling...

860
00:58:09,990 --> 00:58:11,620
...do you want him?

861
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:17,730
I want to rest.

862
00:58:18,670 --> 00:58:21,800
I want to breathe quietly again.

863
00:58:22,900 --> 00:58:24,630
Yes, I want Mitch...

864
00:58:24,840 --> 00:58:26,240
...very badly.

865
00:58:26,580 --> 00:58:28,630
Just think, if it happens...

866
00:58:28,910 --> 00:58:30,540
...I can go away from here...

867
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:33,480
...and not be anyone's problem.

868
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:36,980
Blanche, it will happen.

869
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,550
It will?

870
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,380
It will, honey, it will!

871
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,650
Only...

872
00:58:48,030 --> 00:58:50,160
...don't take another drink.

873
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:05,070
Get away!

874
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:07,280
Get away!

875
00:59:08,220 --> 00:59:10,010
Put me down!

876
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,080
Hi, fatty!

877
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:18,620
Don't!

878
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:28,790
Oh, me.

879
00:59:43,080 --> 00:59:44,380
Come in.

880
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:49,050
Evening, ma'am.

881
00:59:50,930 --> 00:59:52,220
Oh, well.

882
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:55,050
What can I do for you?

883
00:59:55,260 --> 00:59:57,730
I'm collecting for the Evening Star.

884
00:59:59,870 --> 01:00:02,460
I didn't know stars took up collections.

885
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,230
It's a paper, ma'am.

886
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,630
I know.

887
01:00:05,870 --> 01:00:07,740
I was joking, feebly.

888
01:00:08,610 --> 01:00:10,480
Will you have a drink?

889
01:00:11,110 --> 01:00:12,240
No, ma'am.

890
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:15,740
No, thank you.
I can't drink on the job.

891
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:35,980
Well, now, let me see.

892
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,720
No, I don't have a dime.

893
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:47,300
I'm not the lady of the
house, I'm her sister.

894
01:00:47,770 --> 01:00:51,730
I'm one of those poor relations
you've heard tell about.

895
01:00:52,170 --> 01:00:54,640
That's all right, I'll come back later.

896
01:00:59,450 --> 01:01:00,910
Have you got a light?

897
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:01,910
Sure.

898
01:01:10,120 --> 01:01:11,820
This doesn't always work.

899
01:01:12,060 --> 01:01:13,580
It's temperamental.

900
01:01:21,470 --> 01:01:22,600
Why, thanks.

901
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:24,600
Thank you.

902
01:01:31,150 --> 01:01:32,540
What time is it?

903
01:01:34,220 --> 01:01:36,050
Fifteen of seven.

904
01:01:36,220 --> 01:01:37,550
So late?

905
01:01:37,820 --> 01:01:41,780
Don't you love these long rainy
afternoons in New Orleans...

906
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:46,860
...when an hour isn't an hour but a
piece of eternity dropped in our hands?

907
01:01:48,400 --> 01:01:51,300
And who knows what to do with it?

908
01:01:54,240 --> 01:01:57,200
You didn't get caught in the rain?

909
01:01:57,840 --> 01:01:58,860
No, ma'am.

910
01:01:59,240 --> 01:02:00,640
I stepped inside.

911
01:02:01,180 --> 01:02:03,640
In a drugstore and had a soda.

912
01:02:04,010 --> 01:02:05,310
Chocolate?

913
01:02:05,610 --> 01:02:06,640
Cherry.

914
01:02:08,680 --> 01:02:11,150
You're going to make my mouth water.

915
01:02:13,620 --> 01:02:15,150
I guess I...

916
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:16,820
Young man!

917
01:02:17,690 --> 01:02:18,820
Young...

918
01:02:19,430 --> 01:02:20,590
...young...

919
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:22,820
...young man.

920
01:02:23,700 --> 01:02:28,600
Did anyone ever tell you you look like
a prince out of the Arabian Nights?

921
01:02:30,700 --> 01:02:32,330
You do, honey lamb.

922
01:02:34,280 --> 01:02:35,500
Come here.

923
01:02:37,450 --> 01:02:39,410
Come on over here like I told you.

924
01:02:45,650 --> 01:02:47,920
I want to kiss you just once...

925
01:02:48,160 --> 01:02:49,520
...softly...

926
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:52,120
...and sweetly on your mouth.

927
01:03:04,070 --> 01:03:05,700
Run away now, quickly.

928
01:03:06,070 --> 01:03:10,640
I'd like to keep you, but I must be
good and keep my hands off children.

929
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:24,380
Look who's here!

930
01:03:24,690 --> 01:03:26,890
My Rosenkavalier!

931
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:30,660
Oh, bow to me first.

932
01:03:33,430 --> 01:03:35,730
Now, present them.

933
01:03:58,030 --> 01:03:59,420
Hi ya, Mitch.

934
01:04:07,130 --> 01:04:10,100
You haven't had much
fun out of this evening.

935
01:04:10,740 --> 01:04:12,430
I spoiled it for you.

936
01:04:12,640 --> 01:04:13,700
No, you didn't.

937
01:04:13,870 --> 01:04:17,110
I couldn't rise to the
occasion, that was all.

938
01:04:17,380 --> 01:04:21,510
I've never tried so hard to be gay
and made such a dismal mess of it.

939
01:04:21,750 --> 01:04:24,780
I get 10 points for trying. I did try.

940
01:04:28,890 --> 01:04:30,290
Hello, moon.

941
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:35,300
I'm looking for the Pleiades,
the Seven Sisters...

942
01:04:35,500 --> 01:04:37,790
...but these girls aren't out tonight.

943
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:41,130
Yes, they are. There
they are, God bless them.

944
01:04:41,340 --> 01:04:44,030
All in a bunch going home from
their little bridge party.

945
01:04:44,270 --> 01:04:45,640
May I kiss you?

946
01:04:46,070 --> 01:04:48,040
Why do you always ask me if you may?

947
01:04:48,280 --> 01:04:50,140
I don't know if you want me to.

948
01:04:50,340 --> 01:04:53,370
- Why so doubtful?
- When we kissed at the lake...

949
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:56,740
It wasn't the kiss I objected to.
I liked the kiss.

950
01:04:56,920 --> 01:05:00,250
It was the other familiarity
I felt obliged to discourage.

951
01:05:00,590 --> 01:05:04,820
Not that I resented it, not a bit.
I was flattered that you...

952
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:06,390
...desired me.

953
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:09,320
But, you and I know
that a single girl...

954
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:13,830
...has got to keep a firm hold on
her emotions or she'll be lost.

955
01:05:14,440 --> 01:05:15,560
Lost?

956
01:05:15,800 --> 01:05:19,400
I guess you're used to the type
of girl that likes to be lost.

957
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:23,400
I like you to be exactly
the way that you are.

958
01:05:24,040 --> 01:05:27,340
In all my experience I have
never known anyone like you.

959
01:05:33,450 --> 01:05:35,180
Are you laughing at me?

960
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,590
No, honey.

961
01:05:41,400 --> 01:05:43,090
I'm not laughing at you.

962
01:05:44,630 --> 01:05:48,530
Come on, let's finish our nightcap.

963
01:05:48,740 --> 01:05:52,800
You've been so anxious and solemn
all evening, we both have.

964
01:05:52,970 --> 01:05:56,200
For these last remaining
moments of our lives together...

965
01:05:56,410 --> 01:05:58,440
...I want to create joie de vivre!

966
01:06:01,650 --> 01:06:03,620
I'm lighting this candle.

967
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,550
That's good.

968
01:06:06,750 --> 01:06:08,810
I'm going to be very bohemian.

969
01:06:08,990 --> 01:06:13,620
We are going to pretend we're sitting
in a little artists' cafe in Paris.

970
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:18,830
Understand?

971
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:21,060
No, I don't understand French.

972
01:06:22,440 --> 01:06:24,400
Sit down. Take off your coat.

973
01:06:24,610 --> 01:06:27,470
- Loosen your collar.
- No, I better leave it on.

974
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:28,730
Be comfortable.

975
01:06:28,940 --> 01:06:32,470
I'm ashamed of the way I perspire.
My shirt's sticking to me.

976
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:36,910
Perspiration is healthy.
If people didn't perspire they'd die.

977
01:06:37,120 --> 01:06:38,740
This is a nice coat.

978
01:06:40,020 --> 01:06:41,580
What material is it?

979
01:06:41,790 --> 01:06:43,650
They call this stuff alpaca.

980
01:06:44,290 --> 01:06:46,260
It's very lightweight, alpaca.

981
01:06:46,530 --> 01:06:48,590
Oh, lightweight alpaca.

982
01:06:49,400 --> 01:06:53,160
I don't like to wear a wash-coat
because I sweat right through it.

983
01:06:54,130 --> 01:06:58,870
A man with a heavy build has to be
careful of what he puts on him.

984
01:06:59,140 --> 01:07:00,940
You're not too heavy.

985
01:07:01,140 --> 01:07:02,370
You think so?

986
01:07:02,540 --> 01:07:04,270
You're not delicate.

987
01:07:04,480 --> 01:07:08,680
You have a massive bone structure
and a very imposing physique.

988
01:07:09,820 --> 01:07:11,110
I thank you.

989
01:07:12,220 --> 01:07:15,520
Last Christmas I was given a
membership to the Sports Club.

990
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:18,950
- Good.
- It was the finest present I ever got.

991
01:07:19,560 --> 01:07:23,520
I lift weights there. I swim.
I keep myself fit.

992
01:07:23,930 --> 01:07:27,460
When I started, I was soft in
the belly, but now it's hard.

993
01:07:27,670 --> 01:07:30,900
It's so hard a man can
punch me and it don't hurt.

994
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,400
Punch me.

995
01:07:33,670 --> 01:07:35,400
Go ahead. Punch.

996
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:36,640
Come on.

997
01:07:38,010 --> 01:07:39,480
Gracious.

998
01:07:39,750 --> 01:07:40,650
See?

999
01:07:44,450 --> 01:07:45,920
Guess my weight.

1000
01:07:46,520 --> 01:07:50,920
I'd say in the vicinity of
one hundred and eighty pounds.

1001
01:07:51,090 --> 01:07:52,560
- Guess again.
- Not so much?

1002
01:07:52,760 --> 01:07:54,160
No, more!

1003
01:07:55,030 --> 01:07:59,230
I weight 207 pounds. I'm six feet,

1004
01:08:01,870 --> 01:08:05,000
Oh, my goodness, it's awe-inspiring.

1005
01:08:06,710 --> 01:08:10,730
My weight's not a very interesting
subject. What's yours?

1006
01:08:12,280 --> 01:08:13,580
My weight?

1007
01:08:13,880 --> 01:08:14,850
Guess.

1008
01:08:15,120 --> 01:08:16,170
Let me lift you.

1009
01:08:16,480 --> 01:08:17,950
Samson!

1010
01:08:18,120 --> 01:08:20,250
Go on, lift me!

1011
01:08:22,220 --> 01:08:26,090
- You're light as a feather!
- You may release me now.

1012
01:08:26,290 --> 01:08:28,260
I said, unhand me, sir.

1013
01:08:29,730 --> 01:08:32,860
We're in public. You must
behave like a gentleman.

1014
01:08:33,070 --> 01:08:34,760
Slap me if I get out of bounds.

1015
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:38,030
It won't be necessary.
You're a natural gentleman.

1016
01:08:38,240 --> 01:08:40,210
One of the few in the world.

1017
01:08:40,410 --> 01:08:44,870
I don't want you to think that
I'm severe or old-maid-ish.

1018
01:08:45,080 --> 01:08:47,270
It's just, well, I guess I have...

1019
01:08:47,650 --> 01:08:49,550
...old-fashioned ideals.

1020
01:09:04,770 --> 01:09:06,730
Where's Stanley and Stella?

1021
01:09:07,100 --> 01:09:10,070
They were planning to take
in a midnight preview.

1022
01:09:10,540 --> 01:09:12,400
We should all go out together.

1023
01:09:14,340 --> 01:09:16,070
That's not a good plan.

1024
01:09:16,610 --> 01:09:17,740
Why not?

1025
01:09:18,550 --> 01:09:20,910
You are an old friend of Stanley's?

1026
01:09:21,110 --> 01:09:23,140
We was together in the 241st.

1027
01:09:23,350 --> 01:09:25,510
I guess he talks to you frankly.

1028
01:09:26,790 --> 01:09:28,580
Has he talked about me?

1029
01:09:30,790 --> 01:09:33,760
- Not much.
- The way you say that, I suspect he has.

1030
01:09:33,960 --> 01:09:35,020
Not much.

1031
01:09:35,200 --> 01:09:38,820
What would you say his
attitude toward me was?

1032
01:09:39,070 --> 01:09:40,160
Why ask that?

1033
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:42,530
- Well?
- Don't you get along with him?

1034
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:44,930
What do you think?

1035
01:09:45,210 --> 01:09:47,040
I think he don't understand you.

1036
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:49,180
That's putting it mildly.

1037
01:09:49,480 --> 01:09:52,270
Surely, he must've told
you how much he hates me!

1038
01:09:57,150 --> 01:09:58,950
He doesn't hate you.

1039
01:09:59,150 --> 01:10:01,780
He hates me! Or why would he insult me?

1040
01:10:02,390 --> 01:10:03,620
Of course...

1041
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,690
...there is such a thing
as the hostility of...

1042
01:10:07,090 --> 01:10:10,550
Perhaps, in some strange
kind of way he...

1043
01:10:14,230 --> 01:10:15,960
To think of it makes me...

1044
01:10:18,010 --> 01:10:19,200
Yes, honey?

1045
01:10:19,910 --> 01:10:22,810
- Can I ask you a question?
- Yes. What?

1046
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:25,080
How old are you?

1047
01:10:27,110 --> 01:10:29,880
What do you want to know that for?

1048
01:10:30,420 --> 01:10:34,220
I talked to my mother about you
and she said, "How old is Blanche?"

1049
01:10:35,760 --> 01:10:37,820
You talked to your mother about me?

1050
01:10:38,030 --> 01:10:38,890
Yes.

1051
01:10:39,430 --> 01:10:40,390
Why?

1052
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,590
Because I told her how nice
you were... and I liked you.

1053
01:10:45,530 --> 01:10:46,730
Were you...

1054
01:10:47,200 --> 01:10:48,670
...sincere about that?

1055
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:52,000
You know I was!

1056
01:10:52,770 --> 01:10:55,500
Why did your mother
want to know my age?

1057
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,010
She's sick and...

1058
01:10:58,210 --> 01:11:00,680
I'm sorry to hear it. Badly?

1059
01:11:01,380 --> 01:11:02,910
She won't live long.

1060
01:11:03,450 --> 01:11:05,010
Maybe just a few months.

1061
01:11:05,220 --> 01:11:09,850
She worries because I'm not settled.
She wants me to settle down before she...

1062
01:11:13,730 --> 01:11:16,360
You love her very much, don't you?

1063
01:11:19,170 --> 01:11:22,140
You'll be Ionely when
she passes on, won't you?

1064
01:11:26,810 --> 01:11:28,640
I know what that means.

1065
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,880
To be Ionely?

1066
01:11:34,580 --> 01:11:36,380
I loved someone once...

1067
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,880
...and the person I loved, I lost.

1068
01:11:41,190 --> 01:11:42,210
Dead?

1069
01:11:46,330 --> 01:11:47,790
He was a boy...

1070
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:51,890
...just a boy when I
was a very young girl.

1071
01:11:53,000 --> 01:11:56,660
When I was sixteen I made
the discovery, love.

1072
01:11:58,210 --> 01:12:01,900
All at once and much,
much too completely.

1073
01:12:02,940 --> 01:12:06,310
It was like you suddenly
turned a blinding light...

1074
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:09,680
...on something that
had been half in shadow.

1075
01:12:10,950 --> 01:12:13,320
That's how it struck the world for me.

1076
01:12:14,120 --> 01:12:15,820
But I was unlucky...

1077
01:12:16,290 --> 01:12:17,480
...deluded.

1078
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:20,930
There was something about him...

1079
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,090
...a nervousness... a tenderness...

1080
01:12:24,530 --> 01:12:26,090
...an uncertainty.

1081
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:28,260
And I didn't understand.

1082
01:12:29,140 --> 01:12:33,100
I didn't understand why this
boy who wrote poetry...

1083
01:12:33,470 --> 01:12:36,000
...didn't seem able to do anything else.

1084
01:12:36,240 --> 01:12:37,840
Lost every job.

1085
01:12:39,050 --> 01:12:40,780
He came to me for help.

1086
01:12:41,310 --> 01:12:42,780
I didn't know that.

1087
01:12:43,750 --> 01:12:45,450
I didn't know anything...

1088
01:12:45,890 --> 01:12:47,720
...except that I loved him...

1089
01:12:48,490 --> 01:12:50,120
...unendurably.

1090
01:12:51,260 --> 01:12:53,450
At night, I pretended to sleep.

1091
01:12:54,390 --> 01:12:55,950
I heard him crying.

1092
01:12:56,830 --> 01:12:58,020
Crying.

1093
01:13:01,330 --> 01:13:04,240
Crying the way a lost child cries.

1094
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:06,370
I don't understand.

1095
01:13:10,840 --> 01:13:12,740
No, neither did I!

1096
01:13:14,080 --> 01:13:15,740
That is why...

1097
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,140
...I killed him!

1098
01:13:21,190 --> 01:13:22,160
You?

1099
01:13:32,200 --> 01:13:33,460
One night...

1100
01:13:34,270 --> 01:13:37,670
...we drove out to a place
called Moon Lake Casino.

1101
01:13:38,510 --> 01:13:40,800
We danced the Varsouviana.

1102
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,240
In the middle of the dance floor...

1103
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,740
...the boy I had married broke away
from me and ran out of the casino.

1104
01:13:47,950 --> 01:13:49,420
Minutes later...

1105
01:13:49,720 --> 01:13:50,910
...a shot!

1106
01:13:52,120 --> 01:13:53,420
I ran.

1107
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,910
All did.

1108
01:13:55,220 --> 01:13:59,090
All ran and gathered about the terrible
thing at the edge of the lake.

1109
01:14:06,970 --> 01:14:09,700
He'd stuck a revolver into his mouth...

1110
01:14:09,870 --> 01:14:11,340
...and fired.

1111
01:14:17,240 --> 01:14:20,510
It was because on the dance floor...

1112
01:14:21,750 --> 01:14:24,440
...unable to stop myself, I'd said:

1113
01:14:25,490 --> 01:14:26,710
"You're weak.

1114
01:14:27,490 --> 01:14:29,610
I've lost respect for you.

1115
01:14:30,760 --> 01:14:32,350
I despise you."

1116
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,730
And then...

1117
01:14:41,570 --> 01:14:44,970
...the searchlight which had
been turned on the world...

1118
01:14:45,410 --> 01:14:47,240
...was turned off again...

1119
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,140
...and never...

1120
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:53,810
...for one moment since has there
been any light stronger than...

1121
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,310
...than this...

1122
01:14:57,280 --> 01:14:58,750
...yellow lantern.

1123
01:15:15,300 --> 01:15:16,890
You need somebody.

1124
01:15:18,100 --> 01:15:20,000
And I need somebody too.

1125
01:15:27,050 --> 01:15:29,070
Could it be you and me, Blanche?

1126
01:15:45,900 --> 01:15:47,420
Sometimes...

1127
01:15:48,640 --> 01:15:50,360
...there's God...

1128
01:15:51,970 --> 01:15:53,600
...so quickly.

1129
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,710
If you want to mess with me, come on!

1130
01:16:00,910 --> 01:16:02,610
- I'll kill you!
- Cut him loose.

1131
01:16:02,850 --> 01:16:06,220
- You don't know when you get wised up.
- Cut it out!

1132
01:16:06,420 --> 01:16:08,110
- You don't have to wise me up!

1133
01:16:08,760 --> 01:16:11,720
Come on! Get to work.
We gotta get going.

1134
01:16:11,930 --> 01:16:13,620
We got some bucks to make.

1135
01:16:13,860 --> 01:16:18,630
Go ahead and marry her, but hurry up
because she's been at my house 5 months.

1136
01:16:30,110 --> 01:16:32,740
It's only a paper moon

1137
01:16:33,680 --> 01:16:36,580
Sailing over a cardboard sea

1138
01:16:37,620 --> 01:16:39,980
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1139
01:16:42,090 --> 01:16:43,950
If you believed in me

1140
01:16:45,190 --> 01:16:49,590
It's a Barnum and Bailey world
Just as phony as it...

1141
01:16:51,460 --> 01:16:53,260
Hello, Stanley!

1142
01:16:53,700 --> 01:16:56,360
But it wouldn't be make-believe

1143
01:16:57,300 --> 01:16:59,270
If you believed in me

1144
01:17:01,410 --> 01:17:03,170
Some canary bird.

1145
01:17:04,910 --> 01:17:06,170
All right.

1146
01:17:06,410 --> 01:17:10,780
Tell me quietly just what you think
you found out about my sister.

1147
01:17:10,980 --> 01:17:13,610
You know your sister is no lily, right?

1148
01:17:13,990 --> 01:17:16,010
What have you heard and who from?

1149
01:17:16,220 --> 01:17:19,020
You should know the line that
she's has been feeding Mitch.

1150
01:17:19,230 --> 01:17:23,960
Our supply man's gone through Auriol
for years and he knows all about her.

1151
01:17:24,160 --> 01:17:27,620
And everybody in the town of
Auriol knows all about her.

1152
01:17:27,930 --> 01:17:31,630
She's as famous in Auriol as if she
was the United States President.

1153
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:34,470
Only she's not respected by any party.

1154
01:17:43,450 --> 01:17:46,320
So she moved to the
hotel called Flamingo...

1155
01:17:46,520 --> 01:17:48,820
...which is a second-class hotel...

1156
01:17:49,020 --> 01:17:51,720
...and has the advantages
of not interfering...

1157
01:17:51,960 --> 01:17:54,830
...with the private and social
life of the personalities there.

1158
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:58,160
The Flamingo is used to
all kinds of goings-on...

1159
01:17:58,370 --> 01:18:02,930
But even the management of the Flamingo
was impressed by Dame Blanche.

1160
01:18:03,100 --> 01:18:07,940
They were so impressed, they requested
she turn in her room key permanently.

1161
01:18:08,110 --> 01:18:11,510
And this happened a couple of
weeks before she showed here.

1162
01:18:19,050 --> 01:18:21,950
Honey, I know how this
is gonna upset you.

1163
01:18:22,290 --> 01:18:26,020
She pulled the wool over your
eyes just as much as Mitch's.

1164
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:28,590
Pure invention. Not a word of truth.

1165
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,760
I checked on every story.

1166
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:34,360
The trouble was she couldn't
put on her act anymore.

1167
01:18:34,570 --> 01:18:38,590
They wised up and in a few days, they'd
quit and she'd go get another one.

1168
01:18:38,810 --> 01:18:41,970
The same old line, the same
old act and the same old hooey.

1169
01:18:42,140 --> 01:18:44,370
She became the town character...

1170
01:18:44,580 --> 01:18:47,770
...regarded not just as different,
but downright nuts!

1171
01:18:48,010 --> 01:18:50,040
Which brings us to lie #2.

1172
01:18:55,090 --> 01:18:56,280
Now, listen.

1173
01:18:56,520 --> 01:18:58,890
She didn't resign because of her nerves.

1174
01:18:59,090 --> 01:19:01,990
She was kicked out before
the spring term ended.

1175
01:19:06,270 --> 01:19:09,130
I hate to tell you the
reason that step was taken.

1176
01:19:09,340 --> 01:19:11,740
A 17-year-old kid she got mixed up with.

1177
01:19:11,940 --> 01:19:16,400
The boy's dad learned about it and he
got in touch with the superintendent.

1178
01:19:16,610 --> 01:19:19,910
There was practically a town
ordinance passed against her.

1179
01:19:21,110 --> 01:19:22,140
Yes.

1180
01:19:22,350 --> 01:19:25,320
Could I have a towel for my hair?
I just washed it.

1181
01:19:25,690 --> 01:19:26,910
Yes, honey.

1182
01:19:31,620 --> 01:19:33,090
What's the matter?

1183
01:19:33,290 --> 01:19:34,260
Why?

1184
01:19:34,790 --> 01:19:37,420
You have a strange
expression on your face.

1185
01:19:37,630 --> 01:19:39,430
I guess I'm a little tired.

1186
01:19:39,630 --> 01:19:42,760
Why don't you take a hot
bath as soon as I get out?

1187
01:19:43,300 --> 01:19:45,170
How soon will that be?

1188
01:19:45,370 --> 01:19:48,170
Not so long. Possess
your soul in patience.

1189
01:19:48,370 --> 01:19:50,540
It's not my soul I'm worried about.

1190
01:19:55,150 --> 01:19:56,170
Well...

1191
01:20:02,590 --> 01:20:04,280
How many candles are there?

1192
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:07,180
I'm going to stop at 25.

1193
01:20:08,600 --> 01:20:10,290
You got company expected?

1194
01:20:10,500 --> 01:20:12,470
We asked Mitch to come over.

1195
01:20:12,670 --> 01:20:15,290
Don't expect Mitch over here tonight.

1196
01:20:16,240 --> 01:20:17,290
Why?

1197
01:20:18,740 --> 01:20:22,870
Mitch is a buddy of mine. We was
together in the 241st Engineers.

1198
01:20:23,110 --> 01:20:25,870
We work in the same plant!
We're on the same bowling team!

1199
01:20:26,110 --> 01:20:28,380
Stanley Kowalski, did you repeat...

1200
01:20:28,620 --> 01:20:32,640
You bet I did. I'd have it on my
conscience if I knew that stuff...

1201
01:20:32,850 --> 01:20:35,080
...and let him get caught!
- Is Mitch through with her?

1202
01:20:35,260 --> 01:20:37,220
I don't know, but he's wised up.

1203
01:20:37,420 --> 01:20:38,980
He was going to marry her!

1204
01:20:39,190 --> 01:20:43,150
He's not going to now! He's not
going to jump into a tank of sharks!

1205
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:45,330
But what on earth will she do?

1206
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,000
Her future is mapped out for her.

1207
01:20:49,140 --> 01:20:50,900
What do you mean?

1208
01:20:51,200 --> 01:20:55,160
Hey, toots! Canary bird!
Will you get out of the bathroom?!

1209
01:20:58,780 --> 01:21:01,510
I feel so good after a long hot bath.

1210
01:21:01,710 --> 01:21:04,240
I feel so good and cool and rested.

1211
01:21:05,290 --> 01:21:06,250
Do you?

1212
01:21:06,550 --> 01:21:08,420
Yes, I do. So refreshed.

1213
01:21:08,660 --> 01:21:10,850
A hot bath and a long, cold drink...

1214
01:21:11,060 --> 01:21:14,030
...always gives me a
brand-new outlook on life.

1215
01:21:15,960 --> 01:21:17,190
What's wrong?

1216
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,190
Something's happened.

1217
01:21:19,900 --> 01:21:21,130
What is it?

1218
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:23,030
Nothing's happened.

1219
01:21:24,300 --> 01:21:25,700
You're lying.

1220
01:21:26,670 --> 01:21:28,200
Something has.

1221
01:21:38,690 --> 01:21:40,280
Tell us a joke.

1222
01:21:40,490 --> 01:21:42,950
Tell us a funny story and make us laugh.

1223
01:21:43,190 --> 01:21:47,290
We're all so solemn. Is it because
I've been stood up by my beau?

1224
01:21:47,490 --> 01:21:50,950
It's the first time in my
experience with men...

1225
01:21:51,200 --> 01:21:52,960
...that I've been stood up.

1226
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,960
I don't know how to take it.

1227
01:21:56,600 --> 01:21:59,660
Tell us a funny story. Something to...

1228
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,070
...help us out.

1229
01:22:01,270 --> 01:22:03,670
I didn't think you liked my stories.

1230
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:06,570
I like them when they're
amusing, but not indecent.

1231
01:22:06,780 --> 01:22:09,410
I don't know any refined enough for you.

1232
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,250
Then, let me tell one.

1233
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:16,320
Yes. You used to know
a lot of good stories.

1234
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:20,420
Let me see. I have to
run through my repertoire.

1235
01:22:20,630 --> 01:22:23,260
I love parrot stories. Do you?

1236
01:22:23,460 --> 01:22:25,190
This is about an old maid.

1237
01:22:25,370 --> 01:22:27,830
She had a parrot that cursed.

1238
01:22:28,030 --> 01:22:31,440
And knew more vulgar
expressions than Mr. Kowalski.

1239
01:22:32,140 --> 01:22:35,110
The only way to hush the parrot
up was to put the cover...

1240
01:22:42,980 --> 01:22:44,610
It must be upstairs.

1241
01:22:46,250 --> 01:22:48,850
The only way to hush
the parrot up was...

1242
01:22:49,890 --> 01:22:51,220
Go on, Blanche.

1243
01:22:54,330 --> 01:22:56,630
I don't think he will be amused.

1244
01:22:59,770 --> 01:23:03,460
He's too busy making a pig of
himself to think of anything else.

1245
01:23:04,000 --> 01:23:06,530
Your face and fingers
are disgustingly greasy.

1246
01:23:06,770 --> 01:23:08,870
Wash, then help me clear the table.

1247
01:23:18,920 --> 01:23:21,550
That's how I'm going to clear the table.

1248
01:23:23,090 --> 01:23:25,890
Don't you ever talk that way to me.

1249
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:32,060
"Pig, Polack, disgusting,
vulgar, greasy!"

1250
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:37,570
Those kind of words have been on your
and your sister's tongue too much.

1251
01:23:39,710 --> 01:23:41,900
Who do you think you are, queens?

1252
01:23:42,310 --> 01:23:44,780
Huey Long said every man's a king...

1253
01:23:44,940 --> 01:23:48,180
...and I'm the king around here.
Don't forget it.

1254
01:23:55,890 --> 01:23:59,290
My place is all cleared.
Want me to clear yours?

1255
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:12,600
What happened while I bathed?

1256
01:24:12,840 --> 01:24:16,210
- What did he tell you?
- Nothing, nothing.

1257
01:24:17,340 --> 01:24:19,940
He told you something
about Mitch and me.

1258
01:24:20,250 --> 01:24:23,550
You know why Mitch didn't come
tonight, but you won't tell me.

1259
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:24,940
I'll call him.

1260
01:24:25,150 --> 01:24:28,310
- Don't call him.
- Yes. I'll call him on the phone.

1261
01:24:28,990 --> 01:24:30,220
I wouldn't.

1262
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:32,950
I intend to be given an explanation.

1263
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,230
I hope you're pleased with your doings.

1264
01:24:41,930 --> 01:24:45,340
I never had so much trouble
swallowing food in my life...

1265
01:24:45,870 --> 01:24:48,970
...Iooking at that girl's
face and that empty chair.

1266
01:24:49,180 --> 01:24:50,230
Hello!

1267
01:24:50,680 --> 01:24:52,640
I want to talk to Mr. Mitchell.

1268
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:57,140
I'd like to leave a number.

1269
01:24:57,620 --> 01:24:59,640
Glen 4-947.

1270
01:25:00,620 --> 01:25:02,420
And say it's important to call.

1271
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:07,660
Honey, it's going to be all right
after she goes and you have the baby.

1272
01:25:08,460 --> 01:25:11,920
It'll be all right between
you and me, the way it was.

1273
01:25:12,130 --> 01:25:13,660
Remember how it was?

1274
01:25:14,470 --> 01:25:17,870
It'll be so sweet when we can
get them colored lights going...

1275
01:25:18,040 --> 01:25:20,370
...with nobody's sister to hear us.

1276
01:25:32,650 --> 01:25:34,380
Steve and Eunice.

1277
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:39,190
Come on back in.

1278
01:25:48,230 --> 01:25:49,900
Come on, hon.

1279
01:25:50,440 --> 01:25:54,200
What pretty, pretty candles.
Don't burn them, Stella.

1280
01:25:54,440 --> 01:25:56,410
I certainly will.

1281
01:25:57,080 --> 01:25:59,310
Save them for baby's birthdays.

1282
01:25:59,510 --> 01:26:01,910
I hope candles will glow in his life.

1283
01:26:02,080 --> 01:26:04,480
I hope his eyes will be like candles...

1284
01:26:04,680 --> 01:26:06,810
...like two blue candles...

1285
01:26:07,690 --> 01:26:09,550
...lighted in a white cake.

1286
01:26:09,760 --> 01:26:10,920
What poetry.

1287
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:17,720
I shouldn't have called him.

1288
01:26:17,960 --> 01:26:21,490
You know it's hot in there with
the steam from that bathroom?

1289
01:26:23,200 --> 01:26:26,430
I said I was sorry three times!

1290
01:26:30,040 --> 01:26:32,170
I take hot baths for my nerves.

1291
01:26:32,380 --> 01:26:34,070
Hydrotherapy, they call it.

1292
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:36,510
You healthy, nerveless Polack...

1293
01:26:36,720 --> 01:26:39,510
...how can you possibly know
what anxiety feels like?

1294
01:26:39,720 --> 01:26:41,740
I am not a Polack!

1295
01:26:42,220 --> 01:26:45,450
People from Poland are Poles.
They are not Polacks.

1296
01:26:45,630 --> 01:26:48,030
But what I am is 100º% º American.

1297
01:26:48,230 --> 01:26:51,590
I'm born in the greatest country
on earth and I'm proud of it!

1298
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:53,530
Don't ever call me a Polack!

1299
01:26:53,730 --> 01:26:57,360
- That's for me, I'm sure!
- Keep your seat. I'm not so sure.

1300
01:27:01,010 --> 01:27:01,970
Yeah, Mac.

1301
01:27:03,580 --> 01:27:05,770
Keep your hands off me, Stella.

1302
01:27:06,010 --> 01:27:08,480
Why do you look at me so pityingly?

1303
01:27:08,650 --> 01:27:10,210
Will you shut up!

1304
01:27:12,420 --> 01:27:15,110
We got a noisy woman in the place.

1305
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,290
I told you, I don't want to bowl at
Riley's. I had trouble with him.

1306
01:27:21,260 --> 01:27:23,790
I'm the team captain, ain't I?

1307
01:27:24,030 --> 01:27:28,560
We're not bowling at Riley's.
We'll bowl at the Gala. I'll see you.

1308
01:27:28,770 --> 01:27:30,290
Sister Blanche...

1309
01:27:30,540 --> 01:27:33,230
...I got a little birthday
remembrance for you.

1310
01:27:36,540 --> 01:27:38,310
I hope you like it.

1311
01:27:46,850 --> 01:27:48,410
It's a...

1312
01:27:48,620 --> 01:27:51,590
A ticket back to Auriol
on the bus. Tuesday.

1313
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,940
You didn't need to do that.

1314
01:28:13,580 --> 01:28:15,670
Don't forget all I took off of her.

1315
01:28:15,980 --> 01:28:18,780
You didn't need to be so
cruel to someone so alone.

1316
01:28:18,990 --> 01:28:21,550
- She's delicate.
- She is. She was.

1317
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:26,350
You didn't know Blanche as a girl.
Nobody was as tender and as trusting.

1318
01:28:26,590 --> 01:28:28,360
Till people like you abused her.

1319
01:28:28,590 --> 01:28:29,960
Oh, come on.

1320
01:28:30,400 --> 01:28:32,460
Do you think you're going bowling?

1321
01:28:32,670 --> 01:28:33,560
Yes.

1322
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:36,200
You're not. Why did you do this to her?

1323
01:28:36,400 --> 01:28:38,870
- Let go of me!
- I want to know why?!

1324
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,300
You tore it!

1325
01:28:40,510 --> 01:28:44,570
Listen, when we first met, you
and me, you thought I was common.

1326
01:28:44,740 --> 01:28:47,370
You were right. I was common as dirt.

1327
01:28:47,610 --> 01:28:52,480
I saw a photo of a place with columns.
I pulled you off them and you loved it.

1328
01:28:52,850 --> 01:28:54,650
Having colored lights going.

1329
01:28:54,850 --> 01:28:57,980
Wasn't we happy? Wasn't
it okay till she showed?

1330
01:28:59,530 --> 01:29:03,390
Wasn't we happy together?
Wasn't it all okay till she showed?

1331
01:29:03,630 --> 01:29:06,330
Hoity-toity and
describing me like a ape?

1332
01:29:18,880 --> 01:29:20,400
What's wrong with you?

1333
01:29:25,720 --> 01:29:27,690
What's the matter with you?

1334
01:29:35,660 --> 01:29:37,130
Did I hurt you?

1335
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:40,690
Baby, what is it?

1336
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,270
Take me to the hospital.

1337
01:30:16,100 --> 01:30:17,970
Who is it, please.

1338
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:19,230
It's me.

1339
01:30:19,510 --> 01:30:20,670
Me, Mitch!

1340
01:30:34,220 --> 01:30:36,190
Just a minute, please.

1341
01:30:43,730 --> 01:30:44,820
Coming.

1342
01:30:45,130 --> 01:30:46,100
Coming.

1343
01:30:55,040 --> 01:30:56,010
Hello.

1344
01:30:56,240 --> 01:31:00,200
I shouldn't let you in after
the treatment I received.

1345
01:31:00,550 --> 01:31:02,280
So utterly uncavalier.

1346
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:05,350
But, hello, beautiful.
Oh, what a cold shoulder.

1347
01:31:05,550 --> 01:31:08,210
What uncouth apparel.
You haven't shaved!

1348
01:31:08,390 --> 01:31:11,120
I forgive you because it's
such a relief to see you.

1349
01:31:11,320 --> 01:31:14,950
You've stopped that polka tune in
my head. Has that happened to you?

1350
01:31:15,160 --> 01:31:18,030
No, you'd never get anything
awful caught in your head.

1351
01:31:18,260 --> 01:31:20,960
Must that be on?
I don't like fans.

1352
01:31:21,400 --> 01:31:24,300
Let's turn it off.
I'm not partial to them.

1353
01:31:24,500 --> 01:31:27,030
I don't know what there is to drink.

1354
01:31:27,270 --> 01:31:29,870
- I don't want Stan's liquor.
- It isn't Stan's!

1355
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:34,640
Some things on the premises are
actually mine. How's your mother?

1356
01:31:35,080 --> 01:31:37,310
- Is your mother well?
- Why?

1357
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:41,540
Something's wrong with you, but never
mind. I won't cross-examine you.

1358
01:31:41,790 --> 01:31:44,260
I'll pretend I didn't notice anything.

1359
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:47,320
That music again.

1360
01:31:50,360 --> 01:31:51,490
What music?

1361
01:31:53,430 --> 01:31:56,270
The polka they were
playing when Allan...

1362
01:31:57,870 --> 01:31:58,890
Wait!

1363
01:31:59,940 --> 01:32:01,270
There!

1364
01:32:01,540 --> 01:32:02,840
The shot!

1365
01:32:06,310 --> 01:32:08,510
It always stops after that.

1366
01:32:14,950 --> 01:32:16,510
Now it's stopped.

1367
01:32:19,330 --> 01:32:21,020
Are you boxed out of your mind?

1368
01:32:27,970 --> 01:32:30,530
I'll see what I can find in the way...

1369
01:32:31,070 --> 01:32:33,440
Forgive me not being dressed.

1370
01:32:33,640 --> 01:32:37,100
I'd practically given you up.
Had you forgotten the dinner?

1371
01:32:37,340 --> 01:32:40,540
- I wasn't going to see you again.
- I can't hear what you're saying.

1372
01:32:40,750 --> 01:32:44,710
You talk so seldom, when you do
say anything I want to hear it.

1373
01:32:45,080 --> 01:32:46,550
What am I looking for?

1374
01:32:46,750 --> 01:32:51,310
Oh, yes, liquor. We've had so much
excitement I am boxed out of my mind.

1375
01:32:51,590 --> 01:32:53,110
Here's something.

1376
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,120
"Southern Cheer."

1377
01:32:55,590 --> 01:32:57,560
What can that be, I wonder.

1378
01:32:58,160 --> 01:33:02,620
Take your foot off the bed.
The cover's clean. Men don't notice that.

1379
01:33:02,870 --> 01:33:06,570
- I've done so much to this place.
- Aren't you leaving soon?

1380
01:33:06,870 --> 01:33:09,470
Should this be mixed with something?

1381
01:33:11,510 --> 01:33:15,140
It's sweet. Terribly sweet.
I believe it's liqueur.

1382
01:33:15,380 --> 01:33:18,980
I don't think you'll like it, but
try it and maybe you will.

1383
01:33:19,180 --> 01:33:22,480
I told you I don't want any
of his liquor and I mean it.

1384
01:33:22,690 --> 01:33:24,920
He says you've been lapping it up.

1385
01:33:25,120 --> 01:33:28,360
I don't descend to the level
of such cheap accusations.

1386
01:33:29,030 --> 01:33:30,590
What's on your mind?

1387
01:33:31,030 --> 01:33:32,590
I see something in your eyes.

1388
01:33:32,800 --> 01:33:36,760
- It's dark in here.
- I like the dark, it's comforting to me.

1389
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:38,870
I've never seen you in the light.

1390
01:33:39,040 --> 01:33:41,940
- Is it?
- I've never seen you in the afternoon.

1391
01:33:42,040 --> 01:33:43,940
You're at the plant in the afternoon.

1392
01:33:44,140 --> 01:33:46,010
Not on Sunday afternoon!

1393
01:33:46,310 --> 01:33:50,010
You never want to go out till after 6,
and then to a dark place.

1394
01:33:50,220 --> 01:33:52,010
There's an obscure meaning here.

1395
01:33:52,220 --> 01:33:55,780
It means I've never had a good look
at you. Let's turn on the light.

1396
01:33:55,990 --> 01:33:59,450
- Which light? What for?
- This one with the paper thing on it.

1397
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,950
Why did you do that?

1398
01:34:02,160 --> 01:34:04,530
So I can get a good look at you.

1399
01:34:04,730 --> 01:34:07,790
- You don't mean to be insulting.
- No. Just realistic!

1400
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:10,300
I don't want realism. I want magic!

1401
01:34:10,500 --> 01:34:12,700
Yes, yes, magic.

1402
01:34:12,910 --> 01:34:16,640
I try to give that to people.
I do misrepresent things!

1403
01:34:16,840 --> 01:34:20,470
I tell what ought to be truth.
If that is sinful, punish me.

1404
01:34:20,680 --> 01:34:22,650
Don't turn the light on!

1405
01:34:31,520 --> 01:34:34,980
I don't mind you being older
than what I thought but...

1406
01:34:36,530 --> 01:34:38,550
But all the rest of it!

1407
01:34:40,600 --> 01:34:44,900
Why that pitch about your ideals
being so old-fashioned and...

1408
01:34:45,100 --> 01:34:48,010
...all the malarkey you've
dished out all summer.

1409
01:34:48,210 --> 01:34:52,170
I knew you weren't 16 but I was fool
enough to believe you were straight.

1410
01:34:52,950 --> 01:34:57,080
Who said I wasn't straight? My loving
brother-in-law? You believed him?

1411
01:34:57,450 --> 01:35:01,410
No, I called him a liar at first,
then I checked on the story.

1412
01:35:01,950 --> 01:35:04,510
I talked to a merchant in Auriol!

1413
01:35:04,720 --> 01:35:05,690
What merchant?

1414
01:35:05,890 --> 01:35:06,690
Kiefaber.

1415
01:35:06,890 --> 01:35:09,190
The merchant Kiefaber. I know him.

1416
01:35:09,400 --> 01:35:12,690
He whistled at me. I put him in
his place. He's taking revenge.

1417
01:35:12,900 --> 01:35:14,590
Did you stay at the Flamingo?

1418
01:35:14,900 --> 01:35:16,600
Flamingo?

1419
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,770
No!

1420
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:20,440
Tarantula was the name of it.

1421
01:35:20,640 --> 01:35:23,940
I stayed at a hotel called
the Tarantula Arms!

1422
01:35:24,580 --> 01:35:28,710
Yes, a big spider, that's
where I brought my victims.

1423
01:35:30,080 --> 01:35:33,610
I have had many meetings with strangers.

1424
01:35:41,990 --> 01:35:43,890
After the death of Allan...

1425
01:35:44,430 --> 01:35:46,400
...meetings with strangers...

1426
01:35:46,600 --> 01:35:50,300
...was all I seemed able to
fill my empty heart with.

1427
01:35:50,840 --> 01:35:52,300
I think it was panic...

1428
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:56,300
...that drove me from one to another,
searching for protection...

1429
01:35:56,510 --> 01:35:58,570
...here, there, and then...

1430
01:35:58,780 --> 01:36:01,640
...in the most unlikely places.

1431
01:36:02,850 --> 01:36:06,150
Even, at last, in a
seventeen-year-old boy.

1432
01:36:06,350 --> 01:36:08,320
Someone wrote the superintendent.

1433
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:11,750
"This woman is morally
unfit for her position."

1434
01:36:11,960 --> 01:36:12,980
True?

1435
01:36:13,630 --> 01:36:14,650
Yes.

1436
01:36:15,290 --> 01:36:17,260
Unfit somehow, anyway.

1437
01:36:17,630 --> 01:36:19,260
So I came here.

1438
01:36:19,470 --> 01:36:22,330
There was nowhere else I could go.
I was played out.

1439
01:36:22,530 --> 01:36:26,330
Do you know what played out is?
My youth was gone!

1440
01:36:26,870 --> 01:36:30,270
And I met you.
You said you needed someone.

1441
01:36:30,980 --> 01:36:33,100
Well, I needed someone too.

1442
01:36:33,380 --> 01:36:35,440
I thanked God for you.

1443
01:36:35,650 --> 01:36:37,270
You seemed gentle...

1444
01:36:37,720 --> 01:36:41,780
...a cleft in the rock of the
world that I could hide in.

1445
01:36:44,490 --> 01:36:46,690
I suppose I was asking...

1446
01:36:47,330 --> 01:36:48,450
...hoping...

1447
01:36:48,660 --> 01:36:49,960
...too much.

1448
01:36:51,400 --> 01:36:52,690
Kiefaber...

1449
01:36:52,900 --> 01:36:54,200
...Harris and Shaw...

1450
01:36:54,400 --> 01:36:57,700
...have tied an old tin can
to the tail of the kite!

1451
01:36:58,740 --> 01:37:00,140
I thought you were straight.

1452
01:37:02,070 --> 01:37:03,470
Straight?

1453
01:37:04,510 --> 01:37:06,140
What's straight?

1454
01:37:06,750 --> 01:37:09,650
A line can be straight or a street.

1455
01:37:10,420 --> 01:37:12,820
But the heart of a human being?

1456
01:37:15,590 --> 01:37:18,320
- You lied to me.
- Don't say I lied to you.

1457
01:37:18,520 --> 01:37:21,050
Lies, inside and out! All lies!

1458
01:37:21,260 --> 01:37:22,560
Never inside!

1459
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:25,160
I never lied in my heart.

1460
01:37:35,110 --> 01:37:36,570
Woman outside.

1461
01:37:44,950 --> 01:37:47,250
Flowers! Flowers for the dead.

1462
01:37:54,560 --> 01:37:56,030
Not now!

1463
01:38:03,400 --> 01:38:07,930
I've lived in a house where dying
old women remembered their dead men.

1464
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:09,770
Crumble and fade.

1465
01:38:09,980 --> 01:38:10,940
Regrets!

1466
01:38:11,140 --> 01:38:12,110
Recriminations!

1467
01:38:12,310 --> 01:38:15,610
"If you'd done this, it
wouldn't have cost me that!"

1468
01:38:15,810 --> 01:38:16,940
Legacies...

1469
01:38:17,250 --> 01:38:20,780
...and other things, such as
blood-stained pillowslips.

1470
01:38:22,420 --> 01:38:24,220
I used to sit here...

1471
01:38:24,420 --> 01:38:25,620
...and she sat there.

1472
01:38:26,330 --> 01:38:29,120
And death was as close as you are.

1473
01:38:30,160 --> 01:38:31,390
Death:

1474
01:38:32,260 --> 01:38:34,530
The opposite of desire.

1475
01:38:35,100 --> 01:38:36,070
How could you wonder?

1476
01:38:36,840 --> 01:38:39,240
How could you possibly wonder?

1477
01:38:42,770 --> 01:38:44,570
Not far from Belle Reve...

1478
01:38:44,780 --> 01:38:49,650
...before we had lost Belle Reve, was a
camp where they trained young soldiers.

1479
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:53,640
On Saturday nights, they would
go into town and get drunk...

1480
01:38:53,850 --> 01:38:58,310
...and on the way back, they would
stagger onto my lawn and call:

1481
01:38:58,790 --> 01:39:00,310
" Blanche!"

1482
01:39:02,530 --> 01:39:03,820
" Blanche!"

1483
01:39:21,050 --> 01:39:22,600
What do you want?

1484
01:39:30,820 --> 01:39:32,850
Marry me, Mitch!

1485
01:39:34,160 --> 01:39:36,530
I don't think I want
to marry you anymore.

1486
01:39:37,730 --> 01:39:39,130
No?

1487
01:39:40,000 --> 01:39:43,460
No. You're not clean enough to
bring in the house with my...

1488
01:39:43,740 --> 01:39:45,700
Go away then!

1489
01:39:48,170 --> 01:39:50,200
Get out of here.

1490
01:39:50,410 --> 01:39:53,040
Quick, before I start screaming.

1491
01:39:53,580 --> 01:39:56,880
Get out, before I start screaming!

1492
01:39:57,180 --> 01:39:58,480
Screaming!

1493
01:39:58,680 --> 01:40:00,210
Screaming!

1494
01:40:12,260 --> 01:40:13,230
Are you all right?

1495
01:40:16,700 --> 01:40:18,170
What's the matter?

1496
01:40:18,700 --> 01:40:20,000
What's the matter?

1497
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:36,240
- Somebody better get a policeman.
- There's one.

1498
01:40:37,620 --> 01:40:38,680
What happened?

1499
01:40:53,570 --> 01:40:55,370
It's the police. Open up.

1500
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,770
Open up in there!

1501
01:41:01,080 --> 01:41:02,440
It's a police officer.

1502
01:41:02,650 --> 01:41:03,710
Go away.

1503
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,610
What's wrong, are you hurt?

1504
01:41:08,490 --> 01:41:10,390
Yes, go away!

1505
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:13,950
- I'll be good.
- Are you all right?

1506
01:41:14,490 --> 01:41:16,790
- Are you all right?
- I'll be good.

1507
01:41:17,500 --> 01:41:19,400
That's all. Break it up.

1508
01:41:25,100 --> 01:41:26,470
I'll be good.

1509
01:41:30,110 --> 01:41:32,130
I'll be good. I'll be good.

1510
01:41:37,520 --> 01:41:40,750
Gracious, what a thing.

1511
01:41:41,520 --> 01:41:45,650
How about taking a swim?
A moonlight swim at the old rock quarry?

1512
01:41:45,860 --> 01:41:48,090
If anyone is sober enough to drive.

1513
01:41:48,290 --> 01:41:50,820
The best way to stop your head buzzing.

1514
01:41:51,030 --> 01:41:53,830
Only you have to be careful to
dive where the deep pool is.

1515
01:41:54,030 --> 01:41:57,830
If you hit a rock, you
won't come up till tomorrow.

1516
01:41:59,200 --> 01:42:00,330
My goodness!

1517
01:42:00,710 --> 01:42:02,830
They're playing, "Good Night, Ladies."

1518
01:42:04,810 --> 01:42:07,840
May I rest my weary
head on your shoulder?

1519
01:42:08,050 --> 01:42:09,340
It's so...

1520
01:42:09,820 --> 01:42:11,180
...comforting.

1521
01:42:22,490 --> 01:42:23,860
Hi, Blanche.

1522
01:42:42,850 --> 01:42:44,210
How's my sister?

1523
01:42:44,520 --> 01:42:46,210
She's doing okay.

1524
01:42:48,420 --> 01:42:49,980
How's the baby?

1525
01:42:50,420 --> 01:42:54,320
The baby won't come until tomorrow,
so they told me to come home.

1526
01:42:57,260 --> 01:42:58,390
That means...

1527
01:42:59,100 --> 01:43:01,220
...we are to be alone in here?

1528
01:43:02,100 --> 01:43:04,230
Yes, just you and me, Blanche.

1529
01:43:05,440 --> 01:43:08,070
Why've you got those fine feathers on?

1530
01:43:08,870 --> 01:43:10,740
That's right.

1531
01:43:11,540 --> 01:43:13,740
You left before my wire came.

1532
01:43:14,710 --> 01:43:16,340
Did you get a wire?

1533
01:43:17,220 --> 01:43:20,510
I received a telegram from
an old admirer of mine.

1534
01:43:20,720 --> 01:43:21,580
Anything good?

1535
01:43:22,620 --> 01:43:24,850
I think so. An invitation.

1536
01:43:25,790 --> 01:43:26,920
What to?

1537
01:43:29,390 --> 01:43:32,420
A cruise of the Caribbean on a yacht.

1538
01:43:33,470 --> 01:43:35,370
What d' you know!

1539
01:43:35,800 --> 01:43:39,530
I was never so surprised in my life.
It was a bolt from the blue.

1540
01:43:39,910 --> 01:43:41,530
Who'd you say sent it?

1541
01:43:44,140 --> 01:43:45,700
An old beau of mine.

1542
01:43:47,310 --> 01:43:49,780
The one that give you the fox fur?

1543
01:43:50,420 --> 01:43:51,780
Shep Huntleigh.

1544
01:43:51,980 --> 01:43:56,110
I wore his pin in college.
Haven't seen him for awhile and now...

1545
01:43:56,320 --> 01:43:58,950
...this wire inviting me on a cruise!

1546
01:43:59,160 --> 01:44:03,560
The problem is clothes. I tore into
my trunk to see what I had to wear.

1547
01:44:03,760 --> 01:44:06,290
And you come up with a diamond tiara?

1548
01:44:06,500 --> 01:44:08,970
This relic? It's rhinestones.

1549
01:44:09,770 --> 01:44:11,960
I thought it was Tiffany's diamonds.

1550
01:44:12,170 --> 01:44:15,070
Well, anyhow, I shall be
entertained in style.

1551
01:44:15,440 --> 01:44:18,570
It goes to show you
never know what's coming.

1552
01:44:18,940 --> 01:44:21,410
Just when I thought luck was failing me.

1553
01:44:21,610 --> 01:44:24,240
Into the picture pops
this Miami millionaire.

1554
01:44:24,520 --> 01:44:26,980
He's not from Miami. He's from Dallas.

1555
01:44:27,190 --> 01:44:29,240
Just so he's from somewhere.

1556
01:44:30,020 --> 01:44:32,750
Close the curtains before
you undress any further.

1557
01:44:32,960 --> 01:44:35,150
This is all I'll undress right now.

1558
01:44:37,460 --> 01:44:39,660
You seen the bottle opener?

1559
01:44:41,370 --> 01:44:45,430
I used to have a cousin who could
open a beer bottle with his teeth.

1560
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:49,510
That was all he could do.
He was just a human bottle-opener.

1561
01:44:49,710 --> 01:44:50,680
And then...

1562
01:44:50,980 --> 01:44:55,170
...one time, at a wedding party,
he broke his front teeth off.

1563
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:58,850
And then, after that, he
was so ashamed of himself...

1564
01:44:59,050 --> 01:45:02,110
...that he used to sneak out of
the house when company came.

1565
01:45:03,150 --> 01:45:05,020
Rain from heaven!

1566
01:45:13,500 --> 01:45:17,030
You want to bury the hatchet
and make it a loving cup?

1567
01:45:17,740 --> 01:45:19,200
No, thank you.

1568
01:45:20,340 --> 01:45:22,860
- Why don't you get with it?
- What are you doing in here?

1569
01:45:23,070 --> 01:45:25,470
Wait, I want to show you something.

1570
01:45:26,340 --> 01:45:28,710
I break this out on special occasions.

1571
01:45:28,910 --> 01:45:30,880
Silk pajamas I wore on my wedding night.

1572
01:45:31,080 --> 01:45:33,380
When they call and say, "It's a boy!"...

1573
01:45:33,590 --> 01:45:36,650
...I'm going to rip them off
and wave them like a flag.

1574
01:45:36,920 --> 01:45:41,820
We're entitled to put on the dog.
You have a millionaire and I have a baby.

1575
01:45:43,930 --> 01:45:48,730
Think of how divine it'll be to have
privacy again. I could weep with joy.

1576
01:45:49,530 --> 01:45:52,500
The millionaire won't
interfere with your privacy?

1577
01:45:53,040 --> 01:45:55,400
It won't be like what you have in mind.

1578
01:45:55,610 --> 01:45:57,670
This gentleman respects me.

1579
01:45:57,880 --> 01:46:02,010
He wants my companionship. Great
wealth sometimes makes people Ionely.

1580
01:46:02,210 --> 01:46:06,340
A woman of breeding and intelligence
can enrich a man's life.

1581
01:46:06,550 --> 01:46:08,180
I can offer those things.

1582
01:46:08,390 --> 01:46:10,580
And time doesn't take them away.

1583
01:46:10,790 --> 01:46:12,850
Physical beauty is passing...

1584
01:46:13,220 --> 01:46:15,350
...a transitory possession.

1585
01:46:15,890 --> 01:46:19,190
But beauty of the mind,
richness of the spirit...

1586
01:46:19,400 --> 01:46:22,700
...tenderness of the heart... I
have all those things...

1587
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,530
...don't go away, but grow!

1588
01:46:24,740 --> 01:46:26,700
Increase with the years!

1589
01:46:31,080 --> 01:46:34,440
How strange that I should be
called a destitute woman...

1590
01:46:34,650 --> 01:46:38,280
...when I have all these
treasures locked in my heart.

1591
01:46:39,650 --> 01:46:42,620
I think of myself as a
very, very rich woman.

1592
01:46:43,490 --> 01:46:46,620
But I have been foolish,
casting my pearls before...

1593
01:46:47,490 --> 01:46:48,620
Swine?

1594
01:46:50,600 --> 01:46:51,960
Swine!

1595
01:46:52,160 --> 01:46:54,460
I'm thinking of you, and Mr. Mitchell.

1596
01:46:54,670 --> 01:46:56,900
He came tonight in his work clothes...

1597
01:46:57,100 --> 01:47:01,230
...to repeat vicious stories he'd
got from you! I gave him his papers.

1598
01:47:02,110 --> 01:47:06,480
Then he returned with a box of
roses to beg my forgiveness.

1599
01:47:06,680 --> 01:47:08,910
He implored my forgiveness.

1600
01:47:09,610 --> 01:47:12,410
Some things are not forgivable.

1601
01:47:14,790 --> 01:47:18,150
Deliberate cruelty is not forgivable.

1602
01:47:18,860 --> 01:47:22,260
...it is the one unforgivable
thing, in my opinion...

1603
01:47:22,460 --> 01:47:25,830
...and the one thing of which
I have never, never been guilty.

1604
01:47:26,030 --> 01:47:28,760
So I said to him, "Thank you...

1605
01:47:29,470 --> 01:47:32,770
...but I was foolish to think that
we could adapt to one another.

1606
01:47:32,970 --> 01:47:36,500
Our lives are too different.
Our backgrounds are incompatible.

1607
01:47:36,810 --> 01:47:38,780
So, farewell, my friend...

1608
01:47:38,980 --> 01:47:41,610
...and let there be no hard feelings."

1609
01:47:59,900 --> 01:48:03,130
Was this before or after
you got the telegram?

1610
01:48:04,070 --> 01:48:05,300
Telegram?

1611
01:48:05,670 --> 01:48:06,860
Telegram?

1612
01:48:08,740 --> 01:48:09,870
Actually...

1613
01:48:10,070 --> 01:48:12,980
Actually, there wasn't no wire at all!

1614
01:48:17,250 --> 01:48:19,380
There isn't no millionaire!

1615
01:48:21,250 --> 01:48:25,310
And Mitch didn't come with roses
because I know where he is!

1616
01:48:25,690 --> 01:48:30,560
There isn't a thing but imagination
and lies and deceit and tricks!

1617
01:48:30,860 --> 01:48:33,230
Look at yourself! Look at yourself...

1618
01:48:33,430 --> 01:48:35,730
...in an old Mardi Gras outfit...

1619
01:48:35,930 --> 01:48:39,560
...rented for 50 cents
from some rag picker!

1620
01:48:39,870 --> 01:48:42,070
What kind of queen do you think you are?

1621
01:48:42,370 --> 01:48:44,670
I've been onto you from the start.

1622
01:48:44,880 --> 01:48:47,900
And not once did you pull
the wool over my eyes.

1623
01:48:48,110 --> 01:48:51,840
You come in here and sprinkle the
place with powder and perfume...

1624
01:48:52,050 --> 01:48:54,080
...put a lantern over the bulb...

1625
01:48:54,290 --> 01:48:58,240
...and the place has turned into Egypt
and you are the queen of the Nile...

1626
01:48:58,460 --> 01:49:02,090
...sitting on the throne,
drinking my liquor. I say:

1627
01:49:05,230 --> 01:49:06,600
You hear me?

1628
01:49:46,100 --> 01:49:47,230
Flowers!

1629
01:49:54,210 --> 01:49:54,910
Not now!

1630
01:50:06,560 --> 01:50:07,750
Operator.

1631
01:50:08,290 --> 01:50:10,420
I want long distance.

1632
01:50:10,630 --> 01:50:13,100
Never mind, get me Western Union.

1633
01:50:13,300 --> 01:50:15,530
Western Union? Hear me?

1634
01:50:15,730 --> 01:50:19,600
Take down this message:
"Desperate, desperate circumstances.

1635
01:50:19,800 --> 01:50:23,600
Caught in a trap, help me!
Caught in a trap!"

1636
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:24,780
Hello.

1637
01:50:24,980 --> 01:50:26,030
Operator.

1638
01:50:26,580 --> 01:50:29,100
I can give you Western Union now.

1639
01:50:34,420 --> 01:50:35,720
Western Union.

1640
01:50:38,490 --> 01:50:40,460
Hello, Western Union.

1641
01:50:41,830 --> 01:50:43,560
Hello, Western Union.

1642
01:50:46,330 --> 01:50:48,060
This is Western Union.

1643
01:50:51,440 --> 01:50:53,630
You left the phone off the hook.

1644
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,740
This is Western Union.

1645
01:51:05,780 --> 01:51:06,980
Let me...

1646
01:51:08,120 --> 01:51:09,920
Let me get by you.

1647
01:51:10,690 --> 01:51:12,820
If you want to get by me, go ahead.

1648
01:51:14,790 --> 01:51:16,590
You stand over there.

1649
01:51:19,030 --> 01:51:21,230
You got plenty room to get by me now.

1650
01:51:23,200 --> 01:51:24,670
I must get out...

1651
01:51:25,300 --> 01:51:26,330
...somehow.

1652
01:51:28,370 --> 01:51:30,430
Think I'll interfere with you?

1653
01:51:44,820 --> 01:51:47,520
Or maybe you wouldn't be
bad to interfere with.

1654
01:51:50,160 --> 01:51:51,460
Stay back!

1655
01:51:51,830 --> 01:51:53,800
Come any closer and I'Il...

1656
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:56,130
- You'll what?
- Something awful will happen!

1657
01:51:56,330 --> 01:51:57,630
It will!

1658
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,530
What're you putting on?

1659
01:52:10,580 --> 01:52:12,050
I warn you!

1660
01:52:12,250 --> 01:52:13,380
Don't!

1661
01:52:13,850 --> 01:52:15,880
I'm in danger!

1662
01:52:22,360 --> 01:52:23,880
Why'd you do that?

1663
01:52:25,360 --> 01:52:28,390
So I could twist the
broken end in your face.

1664
01:52:29,130 --> 01:52:30,760
I bet you'd do that.

1665
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,160
I would.

1666
01:52:32,370 --> 01:52:33,670
I will if you...

1667
01:52:39,440 --> 01:52:41,070
You want to rough house?

1668
01:52:44,450 --> 01:52:46,350
Let's have a little rough house.

1669
01:52:52,120 --> 01:52:53,590
Tiger! Tiger!

1670
01:52:53,960 --> 01:52:56,590
Drop that bottle top! Drop it!

1671
01:53:11,080 --> 01:53:13,540
Drew to an inside straight and made it.

1672
01:53:15,810 --> 01:53:17,040
Speak English!

1673
01:53:17,250 --> 01:53:18,940
I'm cussing your luck!

1674
01:53:19,150 --> 01:53:22,450
You know what luck is?
Luck is believing you're lucky.

1675
01:53:22,650 --> 01:53:24,210
I believed I was lucky.

1676
01:53:24,420 --> 01:53:28,620
I figured that 4 out of 5 isn't going
to get through but I would and did.

1677
01:53:28,830 --> 01:53:33,630
To hold a front position in this rat
race, you gotta believe you're lucky!

1678
01:53:33,830 --> 01:53:36,960
You... you... you... brag... brag!
Bulls!

1679
01:53:37,170 --> 01:53:38,290
- What's wrong?
- Bull!

1680
01:53:38,500 --> 01:53:41,730
Men are callous things, but
this does beat anything.

1681
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:44,570
Sitting there, making
pigs of yourselves!

1682
01:53:44,780 --> 01:53:45,970
What's wrong with her?

1683
01:53:47,180 --> 01:53:48,480
Come on, deal.

1684
01:53:50,520 --> 01:53:51,410
Bathing.

1685
01:53:52,280 --> 01:53:53,580
How's my baby?

1686
01:53:53,780 --> 01:53:57,240
Sleeping like a little angel.
Brought you some grapes.

1687
01:53:58,460 --> 01:53:59,480
How is she?

1688
01:53:59,690 --> 01:54:04,150
She wouldn't eat. I said we arranged
for her to rest in the country...

1689
01:54:04,360 --> 01:54:07,090
...but she's got it
mixed up in her mind...

1690
01:54:07,300 --> 01:54:10,430
...about a cruise to the
islands with an old beau.

1691
01:54:11,200 --> 01:54:15,500
If anyone calls while I'm bathing,
tell them I'll call them right back.

1692
01:54:15,710 --> 01:54:17,110
And, Stella!

1693
01:54:17,380 --> 01:54:20,940
That cool, yellow silk, the
bouclè, see if it's crushed.

1694
01:54:21,150 --> 01:54:24,600
If it's not too crushed, I'll
wear it. And on the lapel...

1695
01:54:25,050 --> 01:54:28,610
...that silver and turquoise
pin shaped like a seahorse.

1696
01:54:28,820 --> 01:54:31,850
It's in the heart-shaped box
I keep my accessories in.

1697
01:54:32,060 --> 01:54:35,360
And Stella see if you can
locate a bunch of artificial...

1698
01:54:37,830 --> 01:54:42,290
...violets in that box. I'll wear
it with the seahorse, on the lapel.

1699
01:54:55,180 --> 01:54:58,550
- I don't know if I did the right thing.
- What else could you do?

1700
01:54:58,750 --> 01:55:01,980
I couldn't believe her story
and go on living with Stanley.

1701
01:55:02,190 --> 01:55:04,050
Don't you never believe it.

1702
01:55:04,420 --> 01:55:06,050
We gotta keep on going.

1703
01:55:06,260 --> 01:55:09,320
No matter what happens,
we all gotta keep on going.

1704
01:55:11,600 --> 01:55:13,220
Is the coast clear?

1705
01:55:13,430 --> 01:55:14,730
Yes, honey.

1706
01:55:14,930 --> 01:55:16,900
Close the curtains first.

1707
01:55:17,540 --> 01:55:19,400
Tell her she looks well.

1708
01:55:22,370 --> 01:55:23,740
They're closed.

1709
01:55:31,120 --> 01:55:32,740
I washed my hair.

1710
01:55:34,550 --> 01:55:35,580
Did you?

1711
01:55:35,790 --> 01:55:38,760
- I'm not sure all the soap's out.
- It's such fine hair.

1712
01:55:38,960 --> 01:55:41,250
It's a problem. Did I get a call?

1713
01:55:41,460 --> 01:55:42,590
Who from?

1714
01:55:43,130 --> 01:55:44,420
Shep Huntleigh.

1715
01:55:44,800 --> 01:55:47,860
- No, honey. Not yet.
- That's strange.

1716
01:55:48,070 --> 01:55:49,590
Come on, Mitch.

1717
01:56:07,590 --> 01:56:11,210
- I want an explanation of what happened!
- Hush, please, Blanche!

1718
01:56:12,590 --> 01:56:14,960
Why are you two looking at me like that?

1719
01:56:15,160 --> 01:56:17,390
Is there something wrong with me?

1720
01:56:17,600 --> 01:56:19,620
You look wonderful. Doesn't she?

1721
01:56:19,830 --> 01:56:21,800
I understand you're taking a trip.

1722
01:56:23,500 --> 01:56:25,400
She's going on vacation.

1723
01:56:25,600 --> 01:56:27,570
Oh, I'm green with envy.

1724
01:56:29,670 --> 01:56:32,300
Help me, you two. Help me get dressed.

1725
01:56:32,510 --> 01:56:34,310
Is this what you want?

1726
01:56:34,510 --> 01:56:36,070
Yes, that'll do.

1727
01:56:36,280 --> 01:56:38,810
I'm anxious to go.
This place is a trap.

1728
01:56:39,020 --> 01:56:40,810
It's a pretty lavender jacket.

1729
01:56:41,020 --> 01:56:43,150
- It's lilac-colored.
- You're both wrong.

1730
01:56:43,350 --> 01:56:44,980
It's Della Robbia blue.

1731
01:56:45,190 --> 01:56:46,920
Are these grapes washed?

1732
01:56:47,190 --> 01:56:49,990
- Washed! Are they washed?
- From the French market.

1733
01:56:50,190 --> 01:56:52,320
That doesn't mean they're washed.

1734
01:56:56,700 --> 01:56:58,600
The cathedral chimes.

1735
01:56:59,140 --> 01:57:00,600
They're the only...

1736
01:57:01,040 --> 01:57:03,100
...clean thing in the Quarter.

1737
01:57:04,980 --> 01:57:06,500
I'm going now.

1738
01:57:06,710 --> 01:57:07,610
I'm ready.

1739
01:57:08,410 --> 01:57:10,350
- She'll leave before they get here.
- Wait!

1740
01:57:11,650 --> 01:57:14,450
Must we pass in front of those men?

1741
01:57:14,650 --> 01:57:17,850
- Wait here until the game breaks up.
- Yes, sit down.

1742
01:57:25,400 --> 01:57:27,020
Tell them to wait outside.

1743
01:57:27,900 --> 01:57:31,630
Will you mind waiting outside
just a couple seconds?

1744
01:57:42,750 --> 01:57:45,380
Someone is calling for Blanche.

1745
01:57:46,520 --> 01:57:48,210
It is for me, then.

1746
01:57:48,750 --> 01:57:51,650
Is it the gentleman I was
expecting from Dallas?

1747
01:57:52,260 --> 01:57:53,380
Yes.

1748
01:57:53,590 --> 01:57:55,720
Yes, honey, I believe it is.

1749
01:57:57,190 --> 01:57:58,160
Why...

1750
01:57:59,930 --> 01:58:01,730
I'm not quite ready yet.

1751
01:58:03,700 --> 01:58:05,670
Ask him to wait outside.

1752
01:58:07,610 --> 01:58:08,730
Everything packed?

1753
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:12,340
She'll be out soon.

1754
01:58:15,050 --> 01:58:18,070
- They're waiting outside the house.
- They?

1755
01:58:18,880 --> 01:58:20,080
Who "they?"

1756
01:58:21,790 --> 01:58:23,690
There's a lady with him.

1757
01:58:25,120 --> 01:58:27,680
I can't imagine who this lady can be.

1758
01:58:28,460 --> 01:58:29,930
How is she dressed?

1759
01:58:32,460 --> 01:58:34,860
Just a plain, tailored outfit.

1760
01:58:38,800 --> 01:58:40,430
Possibly, she...

1761
01:58:49,650 --> 01:58:51,270
Shall we go now, Blanche?

1762
01:59:05,330 --> 01:59:07,230
Must we go through that room?

1763
01:59:07,930 --> 01:59:09,560
I'll go with you.

1764
01:59:12,170 --> 01:59:13,640
How do I look?

1765
01:59:13,840 --> 01:59:15,140
Lovely.

1766
01:59:16,010 --> 01:59:17,130
Lovely.

1767
01:59:26,780 --> 01:59:30,240
Please, don't get up.
I'm only passing through.

1768
01:59:40,300 --> 01:59:41,320
You...

1769
01:59:42,470 --> 01:59:44,260
...are not the gentleman...

1770
01:59:44,700 --> 01:59:46,330
...I was expecting.

1771
01:59:48,310 --> 01:59:50,500
This man isn't Shep Huntleigh.

1772
01:59:59,480 --> 02:00:01,010
Did you forget something?

1773
02:00:01,320 --> 02:00:02,840
Did you forget something?

1774
02:00:03,050 --> 02:00:04,850
Did you forget something?

1775
02:00:05,060 --> 02:00:07,680
Yes, I forgot something.

1776
02:00:09,160 --> 02:00:10,960
What will they do to her?

1777
02:00:11,160 --> 02:00:13,130
- Don't let them hurt her.

1778
02:00:14,230 --> 02:00:15,960
What will they do to her?

1779
02:00:19,340 --> 02:00:20,800
Hello, Blanche!

1780
02:00:21,010 --> 02:00:22,200
Hello, Blanche!

1781
02:00:22,410 --> 02:00:23,870
Hello, Blanche!

1782
02:00:28,850 --> 02:00:30,810
She says she forgot something.

1783
02:00:31,920 --> 02:00:33,210
That's all right.

1784
02:00:35,750 --> 02:00:38,150
What'd you forget, Blanche?

1785
02:00:39,360 --> 02:00:43,220
- We can pick it up later.
- We'll send it with your trunk.

1786
02:00:48,270 --> 02:00:50,060
I don't know you.

1787
02:00:50,600 --> 02:00:52,400
I don't know you.

1788
02:00:53,040 --> 02:00:56,230
- I want to be left alone! Please!
- Now, Blanche!

1789
02:00:59,040 --> 02:01:02,410
You left nothing here but spilt
talcum and old perfume bottles.

1790
02:01:03,110 --> 02:01:06,240
Unless you want the paper lantern.
You want the lantern?

1791
02:01:26,140 --> 02:01:28,040
You done this to her!

1792
02:01:28,240 --> 02:01:29,360
- Come on!
- Stop!

1793
02:01:29,570 --> 02:01:31,770
- Stop that!
- He did this to her.

1794
02:01:31,980 --> 02:01:33,770
He did this to her.

1795
02:01:34,650 --> 02:01:36,270
He must be nuts!

1796
02:01:42,490 --> 02:01:43,950
What're you looking at?

1797
02:01:44,150 --> 02:01:45,950
I never once touched her.

1798
02:01:50,490 --> 02:01:52,720
These fingernails must be trimmed.

1799
02:01:52,930 --> 02:01:54,230
Jacket, Doctor?

1800
02:01:54,930 --> 02:01:56,900
Not unless necessary.

1801
02:01:58,670 --> 02:02:00,070
Miss DuBois?

1802
02:02:17,790 --> 02:02:18,810
Please.

1803
02:02:19,620 --> 02:02:21,750
It won't be necessary.

1804
02:02:23,530 --> 02:02:24,820
Ask her...

1805
02:02:25,800 --> 02:02:27,660
...to let go of me.

1806
02:02:29,870 --> 02:02:30,990
Let go.

1807
02:03:06,400 --> 02:03:08,030
Whoever you are...

1808
02:03:08,670 --> 02:03:11,700
...I've always depended
on the kindness...

1809
02:03:12,410 --> 02:03:13,970
...of strangers!

1810
02:03:42,940 --> 02:03:43,910
Come on, honey!

1811
02:03:44,110 --> 02:03:47,010
Don't you touch me!
Don't you ever touch me again!

1812
02:04:15,970 --> 02:04:17,600
Come on, Stella!

1813
02:04:19,910 --> 02:04:24,210
I'm not going back in there again.
Not this time. I'm never going back.

1814
02:04:24,410 --> 02:04:25,540
Never!
