1
00:01:44,037 --> 00:01:45,163
Dr. Hill.

2
00:01:45,205 --> 00:01:46,638
Dr. Bassett.

3
00:01:46,673 --> 00:01:48,140
Where's the patient?

4
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:50,472
I hated
to drag you out of bed.

5
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,774
Will you let me go
while there's still time?

6
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:54,803
You'll soon see why I did.

7
00:01:56,616 --> 00:01:59,915
Will you tell
these fools I'm not crazy?

8
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,080
Make them listen to me
before it's too late!

9
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:04,090
I'll listen to you.

10
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:05,489
Let him go.

11
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,457
Who are you?

12
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,965
I'm Dr. Hill
from the state mental hospital.

13
00:02:12,999 --> 00:02:14,591
I'm not insane!

14
00:02:14,634 --> 00:02:16,101
Let him go!

15
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:19,196
Doctor,
now you must listen to me.

16
00:02:19,239 --> 00:02:20,604
You must understand me.

17
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:23,404
I am a doctor, too.
I am not insane.

18
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,876
All right.

19
00:02:24,911 --> 00:02:29,143
Suppose we sit down,
and you tell me what happened?

20
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,620
Well, it started...

21
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:37,122
for me,
it started last Thursday...

22
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:40,615
in response to an urgent
message from my nurse.

23
00:02:40,660 --> 00:02:44,619
I'd hurried home
from a medical convention.

24
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:48,191
At first glance,
everything looked the same.

25
00:02:49,569 --> 00:02:50,866
It wasn't.

26
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,666
Something evil had taken
possession of the town.

27
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:57,141
These two.

28
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:58,644
Here you are.

29
00:02:58,678 --> 00:03:01,078
Thank you, sir.
There you are.

30
00:03:01,114 --> 00:03:02,604
Thank you.

31
00:03:05,618 --> 00:03:07,381
Morning, Mr. Fisher.

32
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,088
Doc!

33
00:03:10,123 --> 00:03:11,590
Hiya, Sally.

34
00:03:11,624 --> 00:03:14,092
Hi. Welcome home.
I'm glad you're back.

35
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:15,788
How's Mickey and the baby?

36
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:19,059
Fine, but everybody else
in Santa Mira needs a doctor.

37
00:03:19,098 --> 00:03:20,588
You've got an office
full of patients.

38
00:03:20,633 --> 00:03:22,396
Oh, no.
On my first day back?

39
00:03:22,435 --> 00:03:24,835
Some of them have
been waiting for two weeks.

40
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:26,930
Why didn't you send them
to Pursey or Carmichael?

41
00:03:26,973 --> 00:03:30,101
Most of 'em wouldn't go.
They want to see you.

42
00:03:30,143 --> 00:03:31,633
Oh?

43
00:03:38,451 --> 00:03:39,645
What's the matter with them?

44
00:03:39,686 --> 00:03:41,017
They wouldn't say.

45
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:44,353
Usually people can't talk enough
about what's ailing them.

46
00:03:44,857 --> 00:03:47,325
For instance,
Wally Eberhard was in twice...

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,988
and called three times,
but he wouldn't say about what.

48
00:03:50,029 --> 00:03:51,155
That's funny.

49
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:52,858
Nobody would talk...
from Becky Driscoll...

50
00:03:52,899 --> 00:03:55,367
down to that fat
traffic cop Sam Janzek.

51
00:03:55,401 --> 00:03:59,201
Becky Driscoll?
I thought she was in England.

52
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:03,699
She got back a few days ago,
and she wanted to see you.

53
00:04:03,743 --> 00:04:05,643
Are you still interested?

54
00:04:05,678 --> 00:04:08,647
My interest in married women
is strictly professional...

55
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:11,650
or yours would have been
a lost cause long ago.

56
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:14,312
- How was the convention?
- Wonderful.

57
00:04:14,354 --> 00:04:17,016
They wept with envy
when I read my paper.

58
00:04:19,459 --> 00:04:20,926
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come back here!

59
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,120
Jimmy!

60
00:04:23,129 --> 00:04:26,530
What's the matter,
Mrs. Grimaldi?

61
00:04:26,566 --> 00:04:28,625
It's nothing. He just don't
want to go to school.

62
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,102
If I were you, I'd have
a talk with his teacher.

63
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:36,108
MRS. GRIMALDl:
I will when I get time.

64
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:38,201
What's the matter?
Has Joe been sick?

65
00:04:38,244 --> 00:04:40,303
MRS. GRIMALDl: No.
We gave the stand up.

66
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,644
- Too much work.
- Oh.

67
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:44,513
The boy's
panic should have told me...

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,711
it was more than school
he was afraid of...

69
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,345
and that littered,
closed-up vegetable stand...

70
00:04:48,388 --> 00:04:50,652
should have
told me something, too.

71
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:52,123
When I last saw it,
less than a month ago...

72
00:04:52,158 --> 00:04:54,752
it was the cleanest
and busiest stand on the road.

73
00:04:54,794 --> 00:04:56,489
That's strange.

74
00:04:56,529 --> 00:04:59,054
She was in to see you, too...
last Friday.

75
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:01,794
I tried to get her to see
Doc Pursey, but she wouldn't.

76
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,961
She said only you
could help her.

77
00:05:04,003 --> 00:05:05,197
Whatever it was...

78
00:05:05,238 --> 00:05:08,537
it couldn't have been
too serious, I guess.

79
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,012
One minor concussion,
two cases of the common cold...

80
00:05:14,047 --> 00:05:16,015
and six canceled appointments.

81
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:18,517
Looks like you rushed me here
for nothing.

82
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:21,019
I don't understand it.
They couldn't wait to see you.

83
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:23,522
But you're still booked up solid
for the afternoon.

84
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:27,287
I bet they don't show.
Look, there's Wally Eberhard...

85
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:29,488
talking somebody
into buying some insurance.

86
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:30,723
There's nothing wrong with him.

87
00:05:30,763 --> 00:05:32,128
Bill Bitner's taking
his secretary to lunch.

88
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:34,766
And speaking of lunch...

89
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,361
will you tell whoever that is
that I'm out having mine?

90
00:05:37,403 --> 00:05:38,529
Is Dr. Bennell in?

91
00:05:38,571 --> 00:05:40,471
Yes, he's here.

92
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:42,235
Do you suppose
he has time to see me?

93
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:44,106
If he hasn't,
something's wrong with him.

94
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,337
Go right in.

95
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:48,773
Becky.

96
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:52,374
Almost five years.

97
00:05:52,418 --> 00:05:53,646
It's wonderful to be home again.

98
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,880
I've been away so long...

99
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:57,515
I feel almost like a stranger
in my own country.

100
00:05:58,524 --> 00:06:00,617
Hope you don't mind my coming
without an appointment.

101
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,855
Not at all.
What'll you have?

102
00:06:02,895 --> 00:06:04,590
We're pushing appendectomies
this week.

103
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:05,756
Oh, Miles.

104
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:08,062
I don't know,
maybe I clown around too much.

105
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:10,069
Pretty soon, my patients...

106
00:06:10,103 --> 00:06:12,571
won't trust me
to prescribe aspirin for them.

107
00:06:12,605 --> 00:06:14,072
Seriously, what's the trouble?

108
00:06:14,107 --> 00:06:16,234
It's my cousin.

109
00:06:16,275 --> 00:06:18,243
Wilma?
What's the matter with her?

110
00:06:19,612 --> 00:06:21,273
She has a...

111
00:06:21,314 --> 00:06:23,908
I guess you'd call it
a delusion.

112
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,282
You know her uncle?
Uncle Ira?

113
00:06:26,319 --> 00:06:27,877
Sure. I'm his doctor.

114
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:30,912
She's got herself
thinking he isn't her uncle.

115
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:32,754
How do you mean?
That they're not really related?

116
00:06:32,792 --> 00:06:35,454
She thinks
he's an impostor or something...

117
00:06:35,495 --> 00:06:37,360
someone who only looks like Ira.

118
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,762
Have you seen him?

119
00:06:38,798 --> 00:06:39,992
I just came from there.

120
00:06:40,032 --> 00:06:43,490
Is he Uncle Ira,
or isn't he Uncle Ira?

121
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,662
Of course he is.

122
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:46,763
I told Wilma that,
but it was no use.

123
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:49,536
Please, would you stop by
and have a talk with her?

124
00:06:49,575 --> 00:06:51,099
Sally says I'm booked up
for the afternoon...

125
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:53,772
but why don't you ask her
to come in and see me?

126
00:06:53,813 --> 00:06:55,303
I'll try.

127
00:06:56,816 --> 00:06:58,647
How about some lunch?

128
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,016
I can't.
I'm meeting Dad at the store.

129
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:06,925
When did you get back?

130
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:09,587
I came back from London
two months ago.

131
00:07:09,629 --> 00:07:11,028
I've been in Reno.

132
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,189
Reno?

133
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,062
Reno.

134
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:15,567
Dad tells me
you were there, too.

135
00:07:15,601 --> 00:07:17,068
Five months ago.

136
00:07:17,103 --> 00:07:19,071
Oh, I'm sorry.

137
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:20,572
So was I.

138
00:07:20,606 --> 00:07:23,074
I wanted it to work.

139
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:26,510
I guess that makes us
lodge brothers now.

140
00:07:26,546 --> 00:07:27,706
Yes.

141
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:30,773
Except I'm paying dues
while you collect them.

142
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:32,978
Ha ha ha! Miles.

143
00:07:40,626 --> 00:07:42,423
- Hello, doc.
- How are you?

144
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
Sam!

145
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,597
At it again, eh?

146
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:46,928
My nurse tells me
you were in last week...

147
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:49,093
and wanted very much
to see me.

148
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:51,126
It wasn't anything important.

149
00:07:52,138 --> 00:07:54,106
Didn't he go to college with us?

150
00:07:54,140 --> 00:07:56,108
Quit his second year
to get married...

151
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:58,610
like I wanted us to do.

152
00:07:58,644 --> 00:08:01,204
Just be thankful
I didn't take you seriously.

153
00:08:01,247 --> 00:08:02,737
You be thankful.

154
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:04,215
I found out
that a doctor's wife...

155
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:05,911
needs the understanding
of an Einstein...

156
00:08:05,952 --> 00:08:07,544
and patience of a saint.

157
00:08:07,587 --> 00:08:09,054
And love?

158
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,056
I wouldn't know about that.

159
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,058
I'm just a general practitioner.

160
00:08:13,092 --> 00:08:15,560
Love is handled
by the specialists.

161
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:18,564
Here's where I leave you.

162
00:08:18,598 --> 00:08:20,065
You know something?

163
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:23,557
This is where you left me
the last time.

164
00:08:23,603 --> 00:08:25,093
Hiya, Johnny.

165
00:08:32,278 --> 00:08:33,939
Sally, I'm off.

166
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:36,107
Tell the answering service
I'll be at home.

167
00:08:36,148 --> 00:08:37,581
Good night, doc.

168
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,676
I'm not going in there!

169
00:08:39,719 --> 00:08:42,347
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Stop all this nonsense.

170
00:08:42,388 --> 00:08:45,585
Hey! Take it easy!

171
00:08:45,625 --> 00:08:47,593
Isn't this Jimmy Grimaldi?

172
00:08:47,627 --> 00:08:49,595
MRS. GRIMALDl: Yes, Doctor.
Can I talk to you a moment?

173
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,529
Sure. I almost
ran you down this morning.

174
00:08:51,564 --> 00:08:53,589
You got to be careful
when you run out in the road.

175
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,100
Come on.

176
00:08:55,134 --> 00:08:56,624
MRS. GRIMALDl: Come on.

177
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,039
Hey! Hey! Hey!

178
00:09:02,074 --> 00:09:04,542
Hey! Slow down now.

179
00:09:04,577 --> 00:09:06,272
School isn't as bad as all that.

180
00:09:06,312 --> 00:09:07,836
MRS. GRIMALDl:
School isn't what upsets him.

181
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,211
It's my daughter-in-law.

182
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:11,716
He's got the crazy idea
she isn't his mother.

183
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:13,218
She isn't! She isn't!

184
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,810
Don't let her get me!

185
00:09:14,854 --> 00:09:17,982
Nobody's going
to get you, Jimmy.

186
00:09:24,497 --> 00:09:26,124
How long has this been going on?

187
00:09:26,165 --> 00:09:28,895
MRS. GRIMALDl: An hour ago,
I found him in the cellar.

188
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:32,234
He wouldn't say anything until
I started to phone his mother.

189
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,068
That's when he said Anna
wasn't his mother.

190
00:09:34,106 --> 00:09:36,574
Could you keep him
with you for a day or so?

191
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:39,203
Give him one of these every
four hours during the day.

192
00:09:39,245 --> 00:09:41,076
Call me tomorrow and let me know
how he's feeling.

193
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,580
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Yes, Doctor, thank you.

194
00:09:42,615 --> 00:09:44,742
Don't let her get me!

195
00:09:44,784 --> 00:09:46,809
Nobody's going to get you.

196
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,083
All right, Jimmy.

197
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:56,594
Open your mouth.

198
00:09:56,629 --> 00:09:58,096
Shut your eyes.

199
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,189
In the words of the poet...

200
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:02,132
I'll give you something
to make you wise.

201
00:10:02,168 --> 00:10:05,604
That's a good boy, Jimmy.

202
00:10:05,638 --> 00:10:07,629
I'm not going home ever.

203
00:10:07,673 --> 00:10:09,971
You're staying at your
grandmother's. Call his mother.

204
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:11,306
She's not my mother!

205
00:10:11,344 --> 00:10:13,642
All right. Run along.
Everything's going to be OK.

206
00:10:13,679 --> 00:10:15,169
You be a good boy now.

207
00:10:15,214 --> 00:10:16,613
MRS. GRIMALDl:
Good night, Doctor.

208
00:10:16,649 --> 00:10:17,843
Good night.

209
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:22,146
I've changed my mind.
I'm not going directly home.

210
00:10:22,188 --> 00:10:23,621
I'm going to stop off
and see Wilma Lentz.

211
00:10:23,656 --> 00:10:25,317
Should I call the boy's mother?

212
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,326
Yes.
Tell her what happened...

213
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,487
and that I suggested
the boy spend the night...

214
00:10:29,528 --> 00:10:31,189
at his grandmother's house.

215
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:40,638
Hello, Miles.

216
00:10:40,673 --> 00:10:43,107
Nice to see you, Wilma.
Becky.

217
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:44,541
Let's have it.

218
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,204
You talked to him.
What do you think?

219
00:10:46,245 --> 00:10:47,439
It's him.

220
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:49,505
He's your Uncle Ira, all right.

221
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,072
He is not.

222
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:00,658
How is he different?

223
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:01,785
That's just it.

224
00:11:01,827 --> 00:11:04,796
There is no difference
you can actually see.

225
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,128
He looks, sounds, acts,
and remembers...

226
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,326
like Uncle Ira.

227
00:11:08,367 --> 00:11:09,891
Then he is your Uncle Ira.

228
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:13,302
You see that?
No matter how you feel, he is.

229
00:11:13,339 --> 00:11:15,807
But he isn't.
There's something missing.

230
00:11:15,841 --> 00:11:19,174
He's been a father to me
since I was a baby.

231
00:11:19,211 --> 00:11:20,735
Always when he talked to me...

232
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:24,375
there was a special look
in his eye.

233
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,679
That look's gone.

234
00:11:25,718 --> 00:11:28,482
What about memories?
There must be certain things...

235
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,955
that only you and he
would know about.

236
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,116
There are.

237
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:34,558
I've talked to him about them.
He remembers them all...

238
00:11:34,593 --> 00:11:37,858
down to the last small detail,
just like Uncle Ira would.

239
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:41,132
But, Miles...

240
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:42,634
there's no emotion.

241
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,794
None!

242
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:46,634
Just the pretense of it.

243
00:11:46,672 --> 00:11:48,640
The words, gesture,
the tone of voice...

244
00:11:48,674 --> 00:11:51,643
everything else is the same,
but not the feeling.

245
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,913
Memories or not,
he isn't my Uncle Ira.

246
00:11:55,948 --> 00:11:57,973
Wilma, I'm on your side.

247
00:11:58,017 --> 00:11:59,746
My business
is people in trouble...

248
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,184
and I'm going to find
a way to help you.

249
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,950
No one could possibly
impersonate your Uncle Ira...

250
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:06,549
without you
or your Aunt Eleda or even me...

251
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,560
seeing a million
little differences.

252
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:10,619
I want you to realize that.

253
00:12:10,663 --> 00:12:12,756
Think about it,
and then you'll know...

254
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,063
that the trouble is inside you.

255
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:18,536
Wilma, where are you?

256
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,436
Out on the lawn.

257
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:22,338
Say nothing to her.

258
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:25,275
Why, Miles,
I didn't know you were here.

259
00:12:25,311 --> 00:12:26,471
Welcome home.

260
00:12:26,512 --> 00:12:27,706
Hello, Mrs. Lentz.

261
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,874
Did you ask Miles
to stay for dinner?

262
00:12:29,915 --> 00:12:31,041
Can't tonight.

263
00:12:31,083 --> 00:12:32,311
I'm making spoon bread.

264
00:12:32,351 --> 00:12:33,818
Please, don't tempt me.

265
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,047
Maybe next time.

266
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,055
Wilma, where are my glasses?

267
00:12:37,089 --> 00:12:38,989
I think
they're on the mantelpiece.

268
00:12:39,024 --> 00:12:40,355
I'll go with you.

269
00:12:51,604 --> 00:12:53,572
Am I going crazy?

270
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,574
Don't spare me.
I've got to know.

271
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,576
No, you're not.
Even these days...

272
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:00,238
it isn't as easy to go crazy
as you might think.

273
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:02,008
But you don't have to be
losing your mind...

274
00:13:02,047 --> 00:13:04,447
to need psychiatric help.

275
00:13:04,483 --> 00:13:06,974
I'd like you to see
a doctor friend of mine.

276
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:09,817
- A psychiatrist?
- Dan Kauffman.

277
00:13:09,855 --> 00:13:13,723
I'll make an appointment
for you tomorrow.

278
00:13:15,161 --> 00:13:17,220
All right.

279
00:13:17,263 --> 00:13:19,788
But it's a waste of time.
There's nothing wrong with me.

280
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:27,162
Better break this up,
or he'll start wondering.

281
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:30,268
Wondering what?

282
00:13:30,309 --> 00:13:32,800
If I don't suspect.
You've been a big help...

283
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:35,643
and I don't want either of you
to worry about me.

284
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,875
I'll be all right.

285
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:38,440
Sure you will.

286
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,543
Staying here, Becky?
Or may I drive you home?

287
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,076
Would you like me to stay?

288
00:13:42,121 --> 00:13:44,885
Of course not.
Good night.

289
00:13:44,924 --> 00:13:46,414
Good night.

290
00:13:56,702 --> 00:13:59,068
Nice having Becky
back again, eh, boy?

291
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:00,594
Sure is.

292
00:14:05,477 --> 00:14:06,774
In the back of my mind...

293
00:14:06,812 --> 00:14:08,541
a warning bell was ringing.

294
00:14:08,581 --> 00:14:10,276
Sick people
who couldn't wait to see me...

295
00:14:10,316 --> 00:14:12,284
then suddenly
were perfectly all right.

296
00:14:12,318 --> 00:14:14,582
A boy claiming
his mother wasn't his mother.

297
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:16,645
A woman claiming her uncle
wasn't her uncle.

298
00:14:16,689 --> 00:14:18,020
But I didn't listen.

299
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,957
Obviously, the boy's mother
was his mother.

300
00:14:19,992 --> 00:14:23,086
I had seen her.
And Uncle Ira was Uncle Ira.

301
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:25,221
There was no doubt of that
after I talked to him.

302
00:14:25,264 --> 00:14:27,528
Miles, he is Ira?

303
00:14:27,566 --> 00:14:30,296
Of course he is.
What do you mean?

304
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,463
It's just Wilma's so positive.

305
00:14:32,504 --> 00:14:34,028
Will she be all right?

306
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,540
I think so.

307
00:14:35,574 --> 00:14:37,474
I'm a doctor,
according to my diploma...

308
00:14:37,509 --> 00:14:39,909
but I don't really know
what Wilma's trouble is.

309
00:14:39,945 --> 00:14:42,209
I could start talking
psychiatrical jargon...

310
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:45,240
but it's out of my line
and in Dan Kauffman's.

311
00:14:47,019 --> 00:14:49,487
I wish you didn't have
to go home for dinner.

312
00:14:49,521 --> 00:14:52,513
I don't.
Dad's eating out with a friend.

313
00:14:53,525 --> 00:14:56,050
I could pick you up
at 7:00.

314
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:57,562
Well...

315
00:14:57,596 --> 00:15:00,156
It's summer,
and the moon is full.

316
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,359
"I know a bank...

317
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,198
"where the wild thyme grows. "

318
00:15:04,236 --> 00:15:05,931
You haven't changed a bit.

319
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,781
Whup! Whoa! Watch out!

320
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,014
Sorry.

321
00:15:23,055 --> 00:15:25,387
Hey, Miles,
when did you get back?

322
00:15:25,424 --> 00:15:26,618
This morning.
How are you, Danny?

323
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:27,785
This is Miss Driscoll.

324
00:15:27,826 --> 00:15:29,726
Dr. Kauffman...
our one and only psychiatrist.

325
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:31,923
Watch out what you say.
Ed, you remember Becky.

326
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:33,454
I should.
I brought her into the world.

327
00:15:33,499 --> 00:15:34,966
You did us all a favor.

328
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,729
This saves me a phone call.

329
00:15:36,769 --> 00:15:39,499
I've got a kid and a woman
who need a witch doctor.

330
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:41,233
Boy says his father
isn't his father...

331
00:15:41,273 --> 00:15:43,366
and the woman says her sister
isn't her sister?

332
00:15:43,409 --> 00:15:44,967
That's pretty close.

333
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:46,978
I knew you'd been
studying hypnosis...

334
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:48,775
but when did you start
reading minds?

335
00:15:48,814 --> 00:15:50,281
He doesn't have to read them.

336
00:15:50,316 --> 00:15:52,250
I've sent him a dozen patients
since it started.

337
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:54,275
What is it?
What's going on?

338
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,788
I don't know.
A strange neurosis...

339
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,586
evidently contagious...
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

340
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:01,422
In two weeks,
it's spread all over town.

341
00:16:02,528 --> 00:16:03,790
What causes it?

342
00:16:03,829 --> 00:16:06,457
Worry about
what's going on in the world.

343
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,068
Make room
for Wilma Lentz tomorrow.

344
00:16:10,102 --> 00:16:12,696
Send her in around 2:00.
Good night.

345
00:16:12,738 --> 00:16:13,898
So long, Danny.

346
00:16:18,978 --> 00:16:22,505
This is the oddest thing
I ever heard of.

347
00:16:22,548 --> 00:16:24,448
Let's hope we don't catch it.

348
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:26,451
I'd hate to wake up
some morning...

349
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,112
and find out you weren't you.

350
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:30,451
I'm not the high-school
kid you used to romance.

351
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:31,683
How could you tell?

352
00:16:31,724 --> 00:16:32,850
You really want to know?

353
00:16:32,891 --> 00:16:34,051
Mm-hmm.

354
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,662
Mmm.
You're Becky Driscoll.

355
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,039
Hey, Santa Mira's looking up.

356
00:16:48,073 --> 00:16:50,541
Has ever since you got back.

357
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,545
Is this an example
of your bedside manner, Doctor?

358
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,070
No, ma'am.
That comes later.

359
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:08,426
Good evening, Doctor.

360
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:10,394
What happened
to the crowd tonight?

361
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,057
I don't know.
It's been this way for weeks.

362
00:17:14,566 --> 00:17:17,262
At least we don't
have to wait for a table.

363
00:17:17,302 --> 00:17:19,532
Take your pick.
Here or here.

364
00:17:19,571 --> 00:17:21,368
Here, I think.
Shall we?

365
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:22,533
Mm-hmm.

366
00:17:22,574 --> 00:17:23,939
Where's the band?

367
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:26,945
Business slumped,
so I had to let them go.

368
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:28,207
There's the jukebox, though.

369
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:29,976
Shall we dance?

370
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,949
I hope you didn't
let the bartender go.

371
00:17:31,984 --> 00:17:33,952
I'm the bartender.
Martinis?

372
00:17:33,986 --> 00:17:35,817
Two. Dry.

373
00:17:36,989 --> 00:17:39,150
Very dry.

374
00:17:40,492 --> 00:17:43,188
Miles, I don't care
what Dr. Kauffman says.

375
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:44,456
I'm worried.

376
00:17:44,496 --> 00:17:46,225
You are in the capable hands...

377
00:17:46,265 --> 00:17:48,460
of your personal physician.

378
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:49,967
Oh, Doctor.

379
00:17:50,002 --> 00:17:52,470
Ah, there's our evening.

380
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,994
Sorry.

381
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,475
Thanks.

382
00:17:58,510 --> 00:17:59,977
Dr. Bennell.

383
00:18:00,012 --> 00:18:03,573
Jack Belicec wants you
to come to his house right away.

384
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:05,412
He says it's urgent.

385
00:18:05,451 --> 00:18:07,442
Thank you.

386
00:18:08,954 --> 00:18:10,922
Better hold those drinks.

387
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,082
Emergency.

388
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,592
At least they called
before we ordered dinner.

389
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:15,752
How hungry are you?

390
00:18:15,794 --> 00:18:17,056
I can wait.

391
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:18,427
It may be a while.

392
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,931
I'll go with you.

393
00:18:19,965 --> 00:18:21,956
Sorry.
We'll be back later.

394
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:38,973
There's Jack.

395
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:53,321
What's the matter?
Teddy sick?

396
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:55,060
No.

397
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,330
Thank heaven.
I thought you'd never arrive.

398
00:18:57,369 --> 00:18:58,734
Then who is sick?

399
00:18:58,770 --> 00:18:59,964
Nobody.

400
00:19:00,005 --> 00:19:02,769
Then why'd you
drag me away from my dinner?

401
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,935
You won't believe it
until you see it.

402
00:19:04,977 --> 00:19:06,239
Hello, Becky.

403
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:07,870
- Hello, Becky.
- Hi, Teddy.

404
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:14,876
Could you forget
you're a doctor a while?

405
00:19:14,920 --> 00:19:16,148
Why?

406
00:19:16,188 --> 00:19:18,247
I don't want you
calling the police.

407
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,724
Quit acting like a writer.

408
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:23,319
Maybe you can tell me.
You're the doctor.

409
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,597
Miles, put the light on
over the pool table.

410
00:19:49,221 --> 00:19:50,882
Go on. Pull it down.

411
00:20:34,366 --> 00:20:36,027
What do you make of it?

412
00:20:38,036 --> 00:20:39,162
Who is he?

413
00:20:39,204 --> 00:20:41,604
I have no idea.

414
00:20:47,379 --> 00:20:50,041
Its face, Miles.
It's vague.

415
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:53,677
Like the first impression
that's stamped on a coin.

416
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:54,845
It isn't finished.

417
00:20:54,886 --> 00:20:56,012
You're right.

418
00:20:56,054 --> 00:20:58,022
All the features
but no details...

419
00:20:58,056 --> 00:20:59,785
no character, no lines.

420
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,725
It's no dead man.

421
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:03,728
Have you got
an ink pad around the house?

422
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,787
There's one in the desk.
Why?

423
00:21:05,831 --> 00:21:07,958
I want to take
the corpse's fingerprints.

424
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,264
Of course
it's a dead man.

425
00:21:10,302 --> 00:21:12,998
I don't know,
but I've got a feeling that...

426
00:21:13,038 --> 00:21:15,871
I know this sounds crazy,
but if I should do an autopsy...

427
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:19,001
I think I'd find every organ
in perfect condition...

428
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:24,278
as perfect
as the body is externally...

429
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,253
everything in working order.

430
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:31,347
All set to go. Hold that down.

431
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,691
These are blank.

432
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:40,994
Waiting for the final
finished face...

433
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:42,625
to be stamped onto it.

434
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,262
But whose face?

435
00:21:45,304 --> 00:21:47,169
Tell me that.

436
00:21:48,373 --> 00:21:50,534
We could all use a drink.

437
00:21:52,811 --> 00:21:54,073
Bourbon all right?

438
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,272
Fine.

439
00:21:55,314 --> 00:21:56,838
Not for me, thanks.

440
00:21:56,882 --> 00:21:59,146
Miles, answer me.
Whose face?

441
00:21:59,184 --> 00:22:01,015
I haven't the slightest idea...

442
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:02,315
have you?

443
00:22:02,354 --> 00:22:05,721
How tall would you say
that thing is?

444
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:07,725
Oh, 5'10", thereabouts.

445
00:22:07,759 --> 00:22:09,727
How much does it weigh?

446
00:22:09,761 --> 00:22:13,219
It's pretty thin.
Maybe 140 pounds.

447
00:22:13,265 --> 00:22:16,530
Jack's 5'10"
and weighs 140 pounds.

448
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,895
Ow!

449
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,235
Teddy, will you stop
talking nonsense?

450
00:22:21,273 --> 00:22:25,232
I'm sorry, darling,
but it isn't nonsense.

451
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:28,246
Becky, you don't think
it's nonsense, do you?

452
00:22:28,280 --> 00:22:29,611
Of course it is.

453
00:22:29,648 --> 00:22:31,240
Jack's standing here
in front of you.

454
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:33,683
Of course I am,
bleeding to death.

455
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:34,845
Excuse me.

456
00:22:34,886 --> 00:22:36,012
You know what?

457
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,318
I'm afraid you may live.

458
00:22:39,791 --> 00:22:41,816
Here, this should fix it.

459
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,760
Miles,
shouldn't we call the police...

460
00:22:43,795 --> 00:22:46,764
and have them take
that dead body out of here?

461
00:22:46,798 --> 00:22:49,767
I'm afraid
it isn't just a dead body.

462
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:51,291
Thanks.

463
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:02,736
I wonder if...

464
00:23:04,015 --> 00:23:05,209
What?

465
00:23:05,250 --> 00:23:07,047
I wonder
if there's any connection.

466
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,814
What do you mean?

467
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,220
There's something
strange afoot in Santa Mira.

468
00:23:11,256 --> 00:23:15,716
Dr. Kauffman calls it
an epidemic of mass hysteria.

469
00:23:15,761 --> 00:23:18,229
Becky's cousin's got it,
for one.

470
00:23:18,263 --> 00:23:20,458
She thinks that her uncle
and her aunt...

471
00:23:20,499 --> 00:23:22,228
aren't her uncle and her aunt.

472
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,735
There's several cases
of such delusion.

473
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:27,739
This isn't you yet...

474
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:30,765
but there is
a structural likeness.

475
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:33,470
It's fantastic.

476
00:23:33,512 --> 00:23:35,571
There must be some reason
this is here.

477
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,582
Would you be willing
to sit up...

478
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:39,516
and see what your friend's
next move is?

479
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,987
If nothing happens by morning,
call the police.

480
00:23:43,021 --> 00:23:44,488
If something happens...

481
00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:46,320
call me, will you?

482
00:23:46,358 --> 00:23:48,019
You know I will.

483
00:23:54,299 --> 00:23:56,096
Good night.
Take it easy.

484
00:23:56,134 --> 00:23:57,260
Sure.

485
00:23:57,302 --> 00:23:58,599
Nothing will happen.

486
00:23:58,637 --> 00:23:59,831
Good night, Becky.

487
00:23:59,871 --> 00:24:00,997
If it does...

488
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:03,940
it'll make a charming,
bloodcurdling mystery story.

489
00:24:11,817 --> 00:24:14,445
I was careful
not to let Becky know...

490
00:24:14,486 --> 00:24:15,714
but I was really scared.

491
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:18,882
Dan Kauffman's explanation
of what was wrong in town...

492
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,289
mass hysteria...

493
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:23,317
couldn't explain away that body
on Jack's billiard table.

494
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:39,410
Come in
while I turn the lights on.

495
00:24:39,444 --> 00:24:40,741
You're a forward wench...

496
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,747
dragging me into a dark hallway
to be kissed.

497
00:24:42,781 --> 00:24:45,079
I'm dragging you
into a dark hallway...

498
00:24:45,116 --> 00:24:47,311
because I'm scared of the dark
tonight.

499
00:24:47,352 --> 00:24:49,479
I'd better stay
and tuck you in.

500
00:24:49,521 --> 00:24:51,045
That way lies madness.

501
00:24:53,091 --> 00:24:54,888
What's wrong with madness?

502
00:24:54,926 --> 00:24:56,757
Madness.
Now good night.

503
00:25:04,736 --> 00:25:07,705
It's about time
you two got home.

504
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,640
Dad, what are you doing
in the basement this late?

505
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,040
Working in my shop.

506
00:25:12,077 --> 00:25:13,271
Want a nightcap, doc?

507
00:25:13,311 --> 00:25:14,608
No, thanks.
It's kind of late.

508
00:25:14,646 --> 00:25:16,705
I'll take a rain check.
Good night.

509
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:18,215
Good night.

510
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,717
Good night.

511
00:25:19,751 --> 00:25:21,742
Good night, Miles.

512
00:25:53,685 --> 00:25:55,585
Aaah!

513
00:25:55,620 --> 00:25:57,247
Look, Jack!

514
00:25:57,289 --> 00:25:59,257
It's you! It's you!

515
00:25:59,291 --> 00:26:01,191
No, no!
You mustn't go near it!

516
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,194
Get out of here! Please!

517
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,718
Please!

518
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:07,197
Miles!

519
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:10,200
What happened, Jack?

520
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,703
Teddy says the thing
in our place is me...

521
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,604
right down
to the cut on my hand.

522
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,039
I didn't wait to look.

523
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:19,202
It's alive! It's alive!

524
00:26:19,244 --> 00:26:21,712
The hand was cut and bleeding!

525
00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:24,715
And the position
of the body had changed!

526
00:26:24,749 --> 00:26:26,478
Here, here. Take this.

527
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,883
I'll call Danny Kauffman.

528
00:26:52,544 --> 00:26:53,670
Hello?

529
00:26:53,712 --> 00:26:54,872
Hello, Danny?

530
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,039
Yeah?

531
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:58,345
Something's happened.
I've got to see you.

532
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:00,442
Will you get over here fast?

533
00:27:00,485 --> 00:27:02,476
It's important.

534
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,954
Oh... OK.

535
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:08,852
He's on his way.

536
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:10,690
I'll make some coffee
and be right with you.

537
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,162
Good deal, Miles.
Thanks.

538
00:27:14,532 --> 00:27:17,000
What about Becky?
Do you think she's all right?

539
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:30,441
Dad, what are you
doing in the basement this late?

540
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:31,847
Working in my shop.

541
00:27:34,386 --> 00:27:36,149
I don't know what it was...

542
00:27:36,187 --> 00:27:37,449
call it a premonition...

543
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,458
but suddenly, I had the feeling
that Becky was in danger.

544
00:27:40,492 --> 00:27:42,483
I had to get to her
as quickly as possible.

545
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,607
I was going
to ring the bell...

546
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:06,879
but then I had a hunch
I'd better be careful.

547
00:28:08,019 --> 00:28:09,782
Something was wrong
in this house.

548
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,290
Becky.

549
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:03,824
Becky!

550
00:31:36,361 --> 00:31:38,829
Miles, will you tell me
what happened?

551
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:40,160
The same thing.

552
00:31:40,198 --> 00:31:41,597
I found another one...

553
00:31:41,633 --> 00:31:43,294
in the cellar
at Becky's house...

554
00:31:43,334 --> 00:31:45,825
coming to life
while I stood there watching it.

555
00:31:45,870 --> 00:31:47,337
It was Becky.

556
00:31:47,372 --> 00:31:50,170
Yeah? I want to see
one of these bodies.

557
00:31:50,208 --> 00:31:51,641
All right.

558
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,509
You're going to bed,
and you're staying with her.

559
00:31:54,545 --> 00:31:56,775
Put on your clothes.
We'll go to Jack's first.

560
00:31:56,814 --> 00:31:58,281
Got any coffee around here?

561
00:31:58,316 --> 00:32:00,841
Yeah.
You'll find some in the kitchen.

562
00:32:00,885 --> 00:32:02,785
He doesn't believe me, Beck.

563
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:04,981
He will.

564
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:18,866
Somebody's playing games!

565
00:32:18,903 --> 00:32:20,996
Rough ones.

566
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:23,633
There's a blood spot.

567
00:32:23,675 --> 00:32:26,166
What you saw was the body
of a murdered man.

568
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,802
Did you examine it carefully?

569
00:32:27,845 --> 00:32:28,971
Yes.

570
00:32:29,013 --> 00:32:31,072
I don't know
what's happened to it.

571
00:32:31,115 --> 00:32:33,447
It wasn't an ordinary body.
There wasn't a mark on it.

572
00:32:33,484 --> 00:32:35,577
I checked it, too.
Not a scratch.

573
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,814
You can kill a man...

574
00:32:36,854 --> 00:32:38,822
by shoving an ice pick
into the base of his brain...

575
00:32:38,856 --> 00:32:41,347
leaving a puncture so small
the naked eye can't see.

576
00:32:41,392 --> 00:32:43,986
You're ignoring the fact
this wasn't a normal body.

577
00:32:44,028 --> 00:32:45,689
What about the hand
Teddy mentioned?

578
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:49,063
I heard lots of things
Teddy said and none made sense.

579
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,295
Hold on, pal.
I was here, too.

580
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,065
So was Miles.

581
00:32:53,104 --> 00:32:55,334
Look, we took his fingerprints.

582
00:32:55,373 --> 00:32:58,240
Look at that.
Tell me why it didn't have any.

583
00:32:58,276 --> 00:33:00,870
He didn't want any,
so he took them off with acid.

584
00:33:00,912 --> 00:33:02,641
Stop trying
to rationalize everything.

585
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:04,477
We have a mystery on our hands.

586
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:05,948
Sure. A real one.

587
00:33:05,984 --> 00:33:08,452
Whose body was it,
and where is it now?

588
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,113
A completely normal mystery.

589
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:12,952
Whatever it is, it's well within
the bounds of human experience.

590
00:33:12,991 --> 00:33:14,618
Don't blow things
out of proportion.

591
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,991
I wouldn't if I hadn't
looked in Becky's cellar.

592
00:33:17,028 --> 00:33:18,825
How do you explain the body
I saw there?

593
00:33:18,863 --> 00:33:20,387
I don't think you saw one.

594
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:21,728
And the body here?

595
00:33:21,766 --> 00:33:24,132
I know you saw it.
Three others saw it, too.

596
00:33:24,168 --> 00:33:25,863
But I dreamed up
the second one?

597
00:33:25,903 --> 00:33:27,962
Doctors can have
hallucinations, too.

598
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,031
The mind is a strange
and wonderful thing.

599
00:33:30,074 --> 00:33:32,406
I'm not sure it'll ever be able
to figure itself out.

600
00:33:32,443 --> 00:33:34,968
Everything else, maybe...
from the atom to the universe...

601
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,378
everything except itself.

602
00:33:36,414 --> 00:33:38,882
Nevertheless,
I saw Becky's double...

603
00:33:38,916 --> 00:33:40,315
and the body that we saw here...

604
00:33:40,351 --> 00:33:42,478
bore an uncomfortable
resemblance to Jack.

605
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,147
Mighty uncomfortable.

606
00:33:44,188 --> 00:33:46,520
Let's go to Becky's
and have a look.

607
00:33:50,361 --> 00:33:52,829
Where's your
girlfriend's double?

608
00:33:52,864 --> 00:33:55,025
OK, skeptic,
lift the lid.

609
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,076
There's a body here,
all right.

610
00:34:08,112 --> 00:34:09,773
- It's Becky's double.
- It sure is.

611
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,145
Take another look.

612
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:17,549
Now you see it,
now you don't.

613
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,523
It was there...
half-hidden by that blanket.

614
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,686
You said
you saw it there just now.

615
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:24,854
I thought I did.

616
00:34:24,896 --> 00:34:26,761
Why did you come here
tonight?

617
00:34:26,798 --> 00:34:28,459
You'd seen a dead man
at Jack's...

618
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:29,796
an average-sized man.

619
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:31,961
The face in death
was smooth and unlined...

620
00:34:32,003 --> 00:34:34,528
bland in expression,
which often happens.

621
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:35,971
You had just become aware...

622
00:34:36,007 --> 00:34:38,840
of a curious, unexplainable,
epidemic mass hysteria.

623
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,970
Men, women, and children
suddenly convinced themselves...

624
00:34:42,013 --> 00:34:43,844
that their relatives weren't
their relatives at all...

625
00:34:43,881 --> 00:34:46,111
so your mind
started playing tricks...

626
00:34:46,150 --> 00:34:48,243
and reality became unreality.

627
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:51,187
The dead man became
Jack's double in your eyes.

628
00:34:51,222 --> 00:34:52,348
Come off it, Dan.

629
00:34:52,390 --> 00:34:54,551
I know
it's all hard to believe...

630
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,322
but these things happen...
even to witch doctors like me.

631
00:34:57,361 --> 00:35:00,091
I saw her here!
She was real!

632
00:35:00,131 --> 00:35:02,122
You saw her
in every tiny detail...

633
00:35:02,166 --> 00:35:04,498
as vividly as anyone
has ever seen anything...

634
00:35:04,535 --> 00:35:06,867
but only in your mind.

635
00:35:06,904 --> 00:35:09,805
Danny, talk all night,
but you're not convincing me.

636
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,437
What are you doing in my cellar?

637
00:35:14,479 --> 00:35:17,448
Using it for an office.
These gentlemen are patients...

638
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,780
badly in need
of psychiatric treatment.

639
00:35:21,052 --> 00:35:22,747
They've been having nightmares.

640
00:35:22,787 --> 00:35:24,049
If you're drunk,
you'd better sober up quick.

641
00:35:24,088 --> 00:35:25,282
The police are coming.

642
00:35:25,323 --> 00:35:26,620
No, we're not drunk.

643
00:35:26,657 --> 00:35:28,750
Nothing that simple.
Pull up a chair.

644
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:30,283
Why, you're all crazy.

645
00:35:30,328 --> 00:35:32,728
What's going on down there?

646
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,754
Hello, Nick.
Glad to see you.

647
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:38,792
You saved these two characters
a trip to the station.

648
00:35:38,836 --> 00:35:42,533
They want to report
finding a body and losing it.

649
00:35:42,573 --> 00:35:44,302
Where? When?

650
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,333
At my place about 7:00.

651
00:35:46,377 --> 00:35:48,937
Why did you
wait so long to report it?

652
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,413
You know better than that, doc.

653
00:35:50,448 --> 00:35:53,975
It was a curious sort
of a body...

654
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:57,351
and then it wasn't there
anymore.

655
00:35:57,388 --> 00:36:00,755
I have a good mind
to throw you both in jail.

656
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:03,123
If you'd seen it,
you'd understand why we waited.

657
00:36:03,161 --> 00:36:06,289
Thin man... 5'10"...

658
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,161
fingerprints burned off
with acid?

659
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:11,532
Just seen it on the slab
in the morgue.

660
00:36:11,569 --> 00:36:12,763
Turned up
in a burning haystack...

661
00:36:12,803 --> 00:36:16,261
on Mike Gessner's south pasture
two hours ago.

662
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,673
Now break it up!

663
00:36:18,709 --> 00:36:20,301
Go on home!

664
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:30,977
You win.
Pick up the marbles.

665
00:36:37,528 --> 00:36:38,654
Good morning.

666
00:36:38,696 --> 00:36:40,027
Good morning.

667
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:44,831
Orange juice.

668
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,700
Thank you.

669
00:36:46,737 --> 00:36:48,432
How do you
like your eggs?

670
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:50,099
Any way you'd like.

671
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,369
Boiled, two minutes?

672
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,535
Two minutes?

673
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:54,044
Mm-hmm.

674
00:36:54,078 --> 00:36:55,340
OK.

675
00:36:56,380 --> 00:36:57,904
You know...

676
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,975
dragging you out of bed
last night was some trouble...

677
00:37:01,018 --> 00:37:02,315
but it was worth it.

678
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,479
Seriously, Miles.

679
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:06,450
What was that?

680
00:37:09,794 --> 00:37:10,954
Who is it?

681
00:37:12,530 --> 00:37:14,623
It's the gas man.

682
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,893
Morning, doc.

683
00:37:17,668 --> 00:37:19,226
Good morning, Charlie.

684
00:37:19,270 --> 00:37:20,498
I guess I'm a little jittery.

685
00:37:20,538 --> 00:37:22,438
Not getting enough sleep.

686
00:37:22,473 --> 00:37:24,168
I won't bother you anymore.

687
00:37:24,208 --> 00:37:26,403
Putting a meter outside
on the patio.

688
00:37:26,444 --> 00:37:27,604
OK.

689
00:37:27,645 --> 00:37:29,943
The eggs will be hard-boiled.

690
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:31,471
Did you do this
for your husband?

691
00:37:31,515 --> 00:37:32,641
Mm-hmm.

692
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,344
Didn't your wife
do this for you?

693
00:37:34,385 --> 00:37:37,218
Yes. She liked to cook.

694
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:39,382
That's one of the reasons
why I'm single...

695
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:42,415
I never was there
when dinner was on the table.

696
00:37:42,460 --> 00:37:43,893
Take my advice...

697
00:37:43,928 --> 00:37:45,589
and don't get mixed up
with a doctor.

698
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:46,961
They're seldom at home.

699
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:48,966
What would you say
if I told you...

700
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:51,468
I was already
mixed up with a doctor?

701
00:37:51,502 --> 00:37:53,902
I'd say it was too good
to be true.

702
00:37:53,938 --> 00:37:56,429
Things like this
can happen all of a sudden.

703
00:37:56,474 --> 00:37:57,873
What's "all of a sudden"
about two people...

704
00:37:57,908 --> 00:37:59,899
who've been friends
most of their lives?

705
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,409
Good morning.

706
00:38:02,446 --> 00:38:04,004
Good morning.

707
00:38:04,048 --> 00:38:05,310
I thought
I smelled some coffee.

708
00:38:05,349 --> 00:38:06,475
Why didn't you give me a call?

709
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:07,779
I didn't want to wake Teddy.

710
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,514
She's wide-awake.
Got a good sleep.

711
00:38:10,554 --> 00:38:12,249
Good.

712
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:15,157
But I don't feel
she should go home right away.

713
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:18,423
Would you mind taking in
boarders for a while?

714
00:38:18,462 --> 00:38:21,761
Or do you have something else
in mind?

715
00:38:21,799 --> 00:38:24,427
I was toying with an idea...

716
00:38:24,468 --> 00:38:25,901
but you can stay.

717
00:38:25,936 --> 00:38:27,631
Here, Jack.

718
00:38:27,672 --> 00:38:29,799
Thank you, doll.
I'll take it to Teddy.

719
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,914
Miles, did you make
that appointment for me...

720
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:43,078
with the psychiatrist?

721
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,587
Yes. 2:00.

722
00:38:44,622 --> 00:38:47,785
I don't need him.
I feel like such a fool.

723
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:50,316
I woke up this morning,
and everything was all right.

724
00:38:50,361 --> 00:38:52,659
- You don't know my relief.
- Yes, I do.

725
00:38:52,697 --> 00:38:55,291
Will you call Becky
and tell her? She was worried.

726
00:38:55,333 --> 00:38:56,459
All right.

727
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,967
She's at your house.

728
00:38:58,002 --> 00:38:59,492
At your house? Why?

729
00:38:59,537 --> 00:39:02,131
It's a long story,
but she'll tell you about it.

730
00:39:17,455 --> 00:39:19,616
Becky's still at his house.

731
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:24,928
All right.

732
00:39:27,131 --> 00:39:28,462
Good morning.

733
00:39:28,499 --> 00:39:30,399
Good morning, Sally.

734
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,902
Take a peek at what's
in the reception room.

735
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,274
Mother,
why don't we go home?

736
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,073
In a little while,
Jimmy.

737
00:39:44,482 --> 00:39:47,280
He certainly made
a quick recovery.

738
00:39:51,021 --> 00:39:52,886
I guess we all have.

739
00:39:52,923 --> 00:39:54,117
But driving home...

740
00:39:54,158 --> 00:39:56,456
I had a lot of questions
and no answers.

741
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:59,429
How could Jimmy and Wilma
seem so normal now?

742
00:39:59,463 --> 00:40:01,363
Surely I had done nothing
to cure them.

743
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,335
Maybe they wanted me
to feel secure, but why?

744
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,796
Well...

745
00:40:07,838 --> 00:40:09,806
I hope
you didn't forget the steaks.

746
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:11,307
I never forget anything.

747
00:40:11,342 --> 00:40:14,334
Don't worry about him.
He's completely housebroken.

748
00:40:14,378 --> 00:40:16,005
I need a martini, Beck.

749
00:40:16,046 --> 00:40:17,172
Onion or olive?

750
00:40:17,214 --> 00:40:19,478
Doesn't matter.
I want to pour it on the coals.

751
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:20,677
They just won't burn.

752
00:40:20,718 --> 00:40:22,618
A martini isn't dry enough.

753
00:40:22,653 --> 00:40:24,814
I'll get you something
that'll start it.

754
00:40:24,855 --> 00:40:26,516
For drinking purposes.

755
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,615
You're looking shipshape.

756
00:40:29,660 --> 00:40:31,218
Thank you, sir.

757
00:40:41,138 --> 00:40:42,469
Here we are.

758
00:41:05,129 --> 00:41:07,120
Jack! Jack!

759
00:41:11,635 --> 00:41:12,795
Ugh.

760
00:41:16,674 --> 00:41:19,006
They're like huge seedpods!

761
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,602
This must be how that
body in my closet was formed.

762
00:41:24,448 --> 00:41:25,881
Where are they from?

763
00:41:25,916 --> 00:41:28,214
I don't know.
If they are seeds or seedpods...

764
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:30,083
they must grow someplace
on a plant.

765
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:32,918
And somebody or something wants
this duplication to take place.

766
00:41:32,957 --> 00:41:34,584
But when they're finished...

767
00:41:34,625 --> 00:41:35,751
what happens to our bodies?

768
00:41:35,793 --> 00:41:36,987
I don't know.

769
00:41:37,027 --> 00:41:39,154
When the process is complete,
probably the original...

770
00:41:39,196 --> 00:41:40,595
is destroyed or disintegrates...

771
00:41:40,631 --> 00:41:41,757
No! Wait!

772
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:43,232
Sorry,
but I take a dim view...

773
00:41:43,267 --> 00:41:44,859
of watching my own destruction
take place.

774
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,200
There isn't any danger
until they're completely formed.

775
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:49,001
We learned that last night
at your house.

776
00:41:49,039 --> 00:41:51,007
Your blank
didn't change right away.

777
00:41:51,041 --> 00:41:53,066
Not until you fell asleep.

778
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:57,814
Miles, when the change
does take place...

779
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,839
do you suppose
there's any difference?

780
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:01,112
There must be.

781
00:42:01,151 --> 00:42:03,949
Wilma noticed it.
So did little Jimmy.

782
00:42:03,988 --> 00:42:06,286
So did I.

783
00:42:06,323 --> 00:42:08,655
My father.

784
00:42:08,692 --> 00:42:11,252
That must be
what he was doing...

785
00:42:11,295 --> 00:42:14,059
in the cellar last night...
placing one of these.

786
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:15,224
I'm sorry.

787
00:42:15,266 --> 00:42:17,291
I felt something wrong,
but I thought it was me...

788
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:18,961
because I'd been away
for so long.

789
00:42:19,003 --> 00:42:21,301
They must be destroyed,
all of them!

790
00:42:21,338 --> 00:42:22,805
They will be...
every one of them.

791
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:25,070
We're going to have
to search every building...

792
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,337
every house in town.

793
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,038
Men, women, and children
have to be examined.

794
00:42:28,078 --> 00:42:29,272
We've got some phoning to do.

795
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:30,575
I'm going to stay
and watch them.

796
00:42:30,614 --> 00:42:31,740
I'm staying with you.

797
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:32,976
Don't call the police!

798
00:42:33,017 --> 00:42:34,211
Nick Grivett
didn't find any body...

799
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:35,809
on a burning haystack!

800
00:42:41,492 --> 00:42:43,357
Why don't you call
Danny? Maybe he can help.

801
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,827
Danny?

802
00:42:44,862 --> 00:42:46,022
No.

803
00:42:46,063 --> 00:42:47,792
I'm afraid it's too late
to call Danny, too.

804
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,264
What are you going to do?

805
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,426
Get help.

806
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:53,493
I hope whatever's taking place
is confined to Santa Mira!

807
00:43:01,378 --> 00:43:02,504
Operator.

808
00:43:02,546 --> 00:43:04,605
This is Dr. Bennell.
This is an emergency.

809
00:43:04,648 --> 00:43:07,776
I want to talk to the Federal
Bureau of Investigation in L.A.

810
00:43:07,818 --> 00:43:09,217
Can you convince them?

811
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:10,550
I've got to.

812
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,146
Where did they come from?

813
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:14,953
So much has been
discovered these past few years.

814
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:16,118
Anything is possible.

815
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,957
Maybe the results
of atomic radiation...

816
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,259
on plant life or animal life...

817
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:23,789
some weird alien organism,
a mutation of some kind.

818
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,496
Why should they take the form
of people... of us?

819
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:28,630
I don't know.

820
00:43:28,672 --> 00:43:29,832
Whatever it is...

821
00:43:29,873 --> 00:43:31,636
whatever intelligence
or instinct it is...

822
00:43:31,675 --> 00:43:35,304
that can govern the forming
of human flesh and blood...

823
00:43:35,346 --> 00:43:37,177
out of thin air is...

824
00:43:37,214 --> 00:43:38,704
well,
it's fantastically powerful...

825
00:43:38,749 --> 00:43:40,876
beyond any comprehension,
malignant.

826
00:43:40,918 --> 00:43:42,112
All that body
in your cellar needed...

827
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,484
was a mind, and it was...

828
00:43:44,521 --> 00:43:46,921
And it was taking mine
while I was asleep.

829
00:43:46,957 --> 00:43:49,016
I could take
that pitchfork myself, and...

830
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,357
On your call
to Los Angeles, Doctor...

831
00:43:51,395 --> 00:43:52,919
they don't answer.

832
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,488
Try again! That office
is open day and night!

833
00:43:55,532 --> 00:43:58,330
If they've taken over
the phone office, we're dead.

834
00:44:13,484 --> 00:44:15,475
Is that me?

835
00:44:45,749 --> 00:44:47,910
This is an emergency!
Emergency!

836
00:44:47,951 --> 00:44:50,010
Look, there's been... Hello?

837
00:44:51,555 --> 00:44:53,750
Operator,
get me a better connection.

838
00:44:53,791 --> 00:44:55,224
I'll try, Doctor.

839
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:57,886
It's no use.

840
00:44:57,928 --> 00:44:59,896
All the Los Angeles circuits
are dead.

841
00:44:59,930 --> 00:45:02,797
OK, try Sacramento!
Give me the state capital.

842
00:45:02,833 --> 00:45:04,858
I want to talk to the governor.

843
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:09,366
The Sacramento
circuits are busy, Doctor.

844
00:45:09,406 --> 00:45:10,964
I'll call you back.

845
00:45:12,843 --> 00:45:14,640
All right.

846
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:16,168
All right.
I'll wait for your call.

847
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,041
I'll take the phone outside.

848
00:45:25,689 --> 00:45:27,418
Jack, they've got the phone.

849
00:45:27,458 --> 00:45:30,393
You and the girls take your car
and make a run for it.

850
00:45:30,427 --> 00:45:32,292
First town you get to,
yell for help.

851
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:33,489
What about you?

852
00:45:33,530 --> 00:45:34,895
That phone
is gonna ring soon.

853
00:45:34,932 --> 00:45:37,366
If nobody answers,
they'll block the roads.

854
00:45:37,401 --> 00:45:38,527
I'll stall them.

855
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,797
Then what?

856
00:45:39,837 --> 00:45:41,202
Try and find out
what's in back of this.

857
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,830
- I'm staying.
- No!

858
00:45:42,873 --> 00:45:44,704
Miles,
don't ask me to leave you.

859
00:45:46,510 --> 00:45:47,636
Jack, get going.

860
00:45:47,678 --> 00:45:49,202
Miles, I can't...

861
00:45:49,246 --> 00:45:50,713
Somebody's got to go,
or we don't get help!

862
00:45:50,748 --> 00:45:52,340
Please,
let's get out of here!

863
00:45:52,382 --> 00:45:54,111
Watch out for yourselves.

864
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,385
Go over by the phone.
Stay there.

865
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,719
If it rings, call me.

866
00:46:39,263 --> 00:46:40,423
Hello.

867
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:41,863
Is Dr. Bennell there?

868
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:44,094
- Yes. I'll get him.
- Never mind.

869
00:46:44,134 --> 00:46:46,398
Just tell him the Sacramento
circuits are still busy...

870
00:46:46,436 --> 00:46:48,063
and ask him if he wants me
to keep trying.

871
00:46:48,105 --> 00:46:49,436
All right. Hold on.

872
00:46:49,473 --> 00:46:51,532
Miles,
the circuits are still busy!

873
00:46:51,575 --> 00:46:52,906
Tell her to keep trying!

874
00:46:52,943 --> 00:46:55,104
Also, try San Francisco
and Washington!

875
00:47:01,418 --> 00:47:02,885
We're getting
out of here right now.

876
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:04,114
Where are we going?

877
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:05,314
Sally's!

878
00:47:07,858 --> 00:47:09,792
We're still unable
to get through to Los Angeles.

879
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:12,159
Do you wish me to keep trying?

880
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:13,424
Dr. Bennell?

881
00:47:14,665 --> 00:47:16,292
Dr. Bennell?

882
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,096
I needed
someone I could trust...

883
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:21,229
and I figured Sally, my nurse,
was my best bet.

884
00:47:21,271 --> 00:47:24,399
I decided to try to phone her
to see if she was at home.

885
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:26,409
Maybe they hadn't
taken over the pay phones.

886
00:47:26,443 --> 00:47:28,673
I'll try the pay phone.

887
00:47:28,712 --> 00:47:30,680
Hey, Mac!

888
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:32,443
Oh, hi, doc.
How are you?

889
00:47:32,482 --> 00:47:35,110
Will you get me
a couple gallons fast?

890
00:47:35,152 --> 00:47:37,279
Sure.
Martha, doc's in a hurry!

891
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,686
Get the windshield, will you?

892
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:44,884
I have to have the keys
to open the gas tank.

893
00:47:47,164 --> 00:47:49,598
Somebody sick out this way?

894
00:47:49,633 --> 00:47:51,430
There's been an accident.

895
00:47:51,468 --> 00:47:53,561
Funny.
We haven't heard about it.

896
00:47:53,604 --> 00:47:55,196
It just happened.

897
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,639
Before I could
even get her number...

898
00:47:57,674 --> 00:47:59,733
I saw Mac closing
the trunk of my car.

899
00:47:59,776 --> 00:48:01,038
He could have been
checking my spare tire...

900
00:48:01,078 --> 00:48:02,670
but I didn't think so.

901
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:03,839
That should do it.

902
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,041
Thank you.

903
00:48:05,082 --> 00:48:06,242
All set?

904
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:07,773
- All set, doc.
- Fine. Thanks.

905
00:48:07,818 --> 00:48:10,309
- Put it on my bill, will you?
- Sure, doc.

906
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,840
What's the matter?

907
00:48:57,801 --> 00:49:00,201
We've got to make it
to Sally's house.

908
00:49:10,013 --> 00:49:12,846
I wasn't sure
I could trust anyone...

909
00:49:12,883 --> 00:49:15,374
but I took a chance
and drove to Sally's anyway.

910
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,220
When I saw several cars
in front of the house...

911
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:25,819
I decided to play it safe.

912
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:32,997
What's wrong?

913
00:49:33,036 --> 00:49:35,004
Probably nothing,
but we're not going in there...

914
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,232
until I'm sure it's safe.

915
00:49:36,273 --> 00:49:38,400
Slide under the wheel
and get out of here fast...

916
00:49:38,442 --> 00:49:40,774
if anybody shows up
looking for us.

917
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:09,599
The baby asleep yet, Sally?

918
00:50:09,639 --> 00:50:11,539
Not yet,
but she will be soon...

919
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:13,736
and there'll be no more tears.

920
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:15,574
Shall I put this in her room?

921
00:50:15,612 --> 00:50:17,239
Yes. In her playpen.

922
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:20,477
No, wait.
Maybe I'd better take it.

923
00:50:20,517 --> 00:50:21,882
Why don't you go in, Miles?

924
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:23,613
We've been waiting for you.

925
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:32,321
Becky, start the car!
Quick!

926
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,091
Becky, get going!

927
00:50:44,274 --> 00:50:46,504
Attention, all units...

928
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:49,410
attention, all units...
apprehend and detain...

929
00:50:49,446 --> 00:50:52,313
Dr. Miles Bennell
and Becky Driscoll...

930
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,680
now believed heading north...

931
00:50:53,717 --> 00:50:55,651
in a black and white
Ford sedan...

932
00:50:55,685 --> 00:51:00,748
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

933
00:51:00,791 --> 00:51:02,884
All units designated
as roadblocks...

934
00:51:02,926 --> 00:51:04,416
move to your stations.

935
00:51:04,461 --> 00:51:05,621
It is urgent.

936
00:51:05,662 --> 00:51:07,425
These two persons
must be detained...

937
00:51:07,464 --> 00:51:09,659
and not permitted
to leave Santa Mira.

938
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,860
Repeat... it is urgent...

939
00:51:14,738 --> 00:51:19,437
Be on the lookout for a 1955
black and white Ford sedan...

940
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:23,936
license number 2-X-3-7-7-9-6.

941
00:51:59,182 --> 00:52:01,673
We'll try to make it
to my office.

942
00:52:01,718 --> 00:52:03,208
Cut into that alley
on the right.

943
00:53:34,411 --> 00:53:37,039
Do you think he'll come back?

944
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:40,072
I don't think they'll
check again before morning.

945
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:43,210
By then, Jack should be here
with help.

946
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:51,556
What if
Jack doesn't get through?

947
00:53:51,595 --> 00:53:53,119
He's gotta get through.

948
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,994
Here. Take two of these.

949
00:53:55,031 --> 00:53:57,022
They'll help you to stay awake.

950
00:54:14,584 --> 00:54:17,052
We can't close our eyes
all night.

951
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,679
We may wake up changed...

952
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:22,250
into something evil and inhuman.

953
00:54:23,994 --> 00:54:25,655
In my practice,
I've seen how people...

954
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:28,323
have allowed their humanity
to drain away.

955
00:54:28,365 --> 00:54:32,062
Only, it happens slowly
instead of all at once.

956
00:54:32,102 --> 00:54:33,933
They didn't seem to mind.

957
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:35,995
But just some people.

958
00:54:36,039 --> 00:54:38,507
All of us... a little bit.

959
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:42,068
We harden our hearts
and grow callous.

960
00:54:42,112 --> 00:54:44,046
Only when we have to fight
to stay human...

961
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,709
do we realize how precious
it is to us...

962
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:49,082
how dear...

963
00:54:51,621 --> 00:54:53,179
as you are to me.

964
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:05,964
Maybe that's Jack
trying to find us.

965
00:55:06,002 --> 00:55:08,266
He'd know better
than to use the phone.

966
00:55:10,006 --> 00:55:11,132
Where is he?

967
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,637
Why doesn't he come?

968
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,246
Just like any Saturday morning.

969
00:55:28,925 --> 00:55:31,485
Len Pearlman, Bill Bittner...

970
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:35,191
Jim Clark and his wife Shirley
and their kids...

971
00:55:35,231 --> 00:55:36,960
people I've known all my life.

972
00:55:37,000 --> 00:55:38,194
What time is it?

973
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,203
Seven forty-five.

974
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:45,230
Yeah, I know.

975
00:55:45,275 --> 00:55:46,537
It's too early to be so busy.

976
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:49,602
What are they doing here?

977
00:55:49,646 --> 00:55:51,614
There's the answer.

978
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,173
There must be strangers in town.

979
00:55:54,217 --> 00:55:57,152
They're waiting for the bus
to come and go.

980
00:55:57,187 --> 00:55:59,849
There isn't another one
through here until 11:00.

981
00:56:54,277 --> 00:56:56,336
Farmers.

982
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:00,777
Grimaldi, Pixley...

983
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,114
Gessner!

984
00:57:02,152 --> 00:57:03,619
Crescent City.

985
00:57:03,653 --> 00:57:07,646
If you have Crescent City
families, step to truck one.

986
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:09,715
Crescent City...

987
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,727
the first truck.

988
00:57:11,761 --> 00:57:13,228
Redbank.

989
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:16,232
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

990
00:57:16,266 --> 00:57:18,291
go to truck number two.

991
00:57:18,334 --> 00:57:21,326
All with Redbank families
or contacts...

992
00:57:21,371 --> 00:57:22,736
truck number two.

993
00:57:22,772 --> 00:57:24,569
Havenhurst...

994
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,234
the third truck.

995
00:57:26,276 --> 00:57:28,403
Havenhurst...
the third truck.

996
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:34,243
Mill Town... the third truck.

997
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:36,252
Valley Springs...

998
00:57:36,286 --> 00:57:37,753
the third truck.

999
00:57:37,787 --> 00:57:39,482
Valley Springs...

1000
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:40,989
First our town...

1001
00:57:41,024 --> 00:57:43,993
then all the towns around us.

1002
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:45,494
It's a malignant disease...

1003
00:57:45,528 --> 00:57:47,496
spreading through
the whole country.

1004
00:57:47,530 --> 00:57:49,327
That's all for today.

1005
00:57:49,365 --> 00:57:51,799
Be ready again tomorrow.

1006
00:58:05,281 --> 00:58:08,216
I can't wait for Jack
any longer. Stay here.

1007
00:58:08,251 --> 00:58:09,377
You're not going out there?

1008
00:58:09,419 --> 00:58:10,943
I've got to stop them!

1009
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:12,648
Wait! We're safe here!

1010
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:18,960
They're not here.
I hope we're not too late.

1011
00:58:18,995 --> 00:58:20,428
Jack! Thank God!

1012
00:58:21,865 --> 00:58:24,129
The whole town's been
taken over by the pods!

1013
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,625
Not quite.
There's still you and Becky.

1014
00:58:27,670 --> 00:58:29,638
Miles, it would have
been so much easier...

1015
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:31,071
if you'd gone to sleep
last night.

1016
00:58:31,107 --> 00:58:33,940
Relax.
We're here to help you.

1017
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,637
You know better than that.

1018
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,147
Where do you want us
to put them?

1019
00:58:39,182 --> 00:58:40,513
Would you like
to watch them grow?

1020
00:58:40,550 --> 00:58:42,882
- No, thanks.
- Put them in there.

1021
00:58:42,919 --> 00:58:46,082
There's nothing to be afraid of.
We're not going to hurt you.

1022
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,953
Once you understand,
you'll be grateful.

1023
00:58:47,991 --> 00:58:50,289
Remember how Teddy and I
fought against it.

1024
00:58:50,326 --> 00:58:51,588
We were wrong.

1025
00:58:51,628 --> 00:58:53,095
You mean Teddy doesn't mind?

1026
00:58:53,129 --> 00:58:55,597
Of course not.
She feels exactly the way I do.

1027
00:58:55,632 --> 00:58:57,099
Let us go!

1028
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:58,327
If we leave town,
we won't come back.

1029
00:58:58,368 --> 00:59:01,860
We can't let you go.
You're dangerous to us.

1030
00:59:01,905 --> 00:59:03,463
Don't fight it, Miles.
It's no use.

1031
00:59:03,506 --> 00:59:06,942
Sooner or later,
you'll have to go to sleep.

1032
00:59:06,976 --> 00:59:09,570
I'll wait for you in the hall.

1033
00:59:09,612 --> 00:59:12,740
Miles,
you and I are scientific men.

1034
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:14,909
You can understand the wonder
of what's happened.

1035
00:59:14,951 --> 00:59:17,715
Just think.
Less than a month ago...

1036
00:59:17,754 --> 00:59:19,585
Santa Mira
was like any other town...

1037
00:59:19,622 --> 00:59:21,021
people with nothing
but problems.

1038
00:59:21,057 --> 00:59:24,026
Then out of the sky
came a solution.

1039
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,029
Seeds drifting through space
for years...

1040
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:29,031
took root in a farmer's field.

1041
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,033
From the seeds came pods...

1042
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,433
which had the power
to reproduce themselves...

1043
00:59:33,469 --> 00:59:37,166
in the exact likeness
of any form of life.

1044
00:59:37,206 --> 00:59:39,674
So that's how it began...

1045
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:41,643
out of the sky.

1046
00:59:43,479 --> 00:59:46,448
Your new bodies
are growing in there.

1047
00:59:46,482 --> 00:59:49,451
They're taking you over
cell for cell...

1048
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,952
atom for atom.

1049
00:59:50,987 --> 00:59:52,454
There's no pain.

1050
00:59:52,488 --> 00:59:54,183
Suddenly, while you're asleep...

1051
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:57,624
they'll absorb your minds,
your memories...

1052
00:59:57,660 --> 01:00:01,187
and you're reborn
into an untroubled world.

1053
01:00:01,230 --> 01:00:03,698
Where everyone's the same?

1054
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:05,701
Exactly.

1055
01:00:05,735 --> 01:00:07,669
What a world.

1056
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:10,696
We're not the last humans left.

1057
01:00:10,740 --> 01:00:12,605
They'll destroy you!

1058
01:00:12,642 --> 01:00:15,668
Tomorrow,
you won't want them to.

1059
01:00:15,712 --> 01:00:17,202
Tomorrow, you'll be one of us.

1060
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:23,318
I love Becky.

1061
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,753
Tomorrow, will I feel the same?

1062
01:00:25,788 --> 01:00:28,416
There's no need for love.

1063
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:30,323
No emotion?

1064
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:34,660
Then you have no feelings,
only the instinct to survive.

1065
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:37,461
You can't love or be loved!
Am I right?

1066
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:39,058
You say it
as if it were terrible.

1067
01:00:39,102 --> 01:00:41,764
Believe me, it isn't.
You've been in love before.

1068
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:45,262
It didn't last.
It never does.

1069
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:48,835
Love, desire, ambition, faith...

1070
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:51,938
without them, life's so simple,
believe me.

1071
01:00:51,981 --> 01:00:54,882
I don't want any part of it.

1072
01:00:54,917 --> 01:00:56,782
You're forgetting
something, Miles.

1073
01:00:56,819 --> 01:00:57,945
What's that?

1074
01:00:57,987 --> 01:01:00,251
You have no choice.

1075
01:01:04,827 --> 01:01:07,261
I guess we haven't any choice.

1076
01:01:07,296 --> 01:01:08,490
Good.

1077
01:01:18,107 --> 01:01:20,701
I want to love and be loved!

1078
01:01:23,513 --> 01:01:25,037
I want your children.

1079
01:01:25,081 --> 01:01:28,050
I don't want a world
without love or grief or beauty.

1080
01:01:28,084 --> 01:01:30,314
I'd rather die.

1081
01:01:30,353 --> 01:01:33,048
No.

1082
01:01:35,725 --> 01:01:38,694
Not unless there's no other way.

1083
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,320
Why didn't they
give us a shot...

1084
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:42,831
or a sleeping pill or something?

1085
01:01:42,865 --> 01:01:46,357
Drugs dull the mind.
Maybe that's the reason.

1086
01:01:54,977 --> 01:01:57,445
No. It wouldn't work.

1087
01:01:57,480 --> 01:02:00,347
I might get one or even two,
but I couldn't get three.

1088
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,010
You're forgetting something,
darling... me.

1089
01:02:02,051 --> 01:02:03,211
It isn't three against one.

1090
01:02:03,252 --> 01:02:05,447
It's three against two.
Give me a knife.

1091
01:02:06,823 --> 01:02:08,313
No.

1092
01:03:14,357 --> 01:03:15,517
There.

1093
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,629
Go by the desk.

1094
01:03:45,621 --> 01:03:47,589
What's going on in there?

1095
01:03:47,623 --> 01:03:50,251
Miles!
Unlock the door!

1096
01:03:50,293 --> 01:03:51,988
Miles, open the door!

1097
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:53,655
Open the door, Miles!

1098
01:03:53,696 --> 01:03:55,357
Aah!

1099
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,094
Open the door!

1100
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,941
Oh! Aah!

1101
01:04:15,318 --> 01:04:16,512
Oh!

1102
01:04:24,894 --> 01:04:27,294
Our only hope is
to make it to the highway.

1103
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:41,810
That does it.

1104
01:04:41,844 --> 01:04:44,574
The only other way
is out the front door...

1105
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:46,241
and there's bound
to be somebody watching.

1106
01:04:46,282 --> 01:04:47,840
We'll have to chance it.

1107
01:05:01,797 --> 01:05:04,766
Keep your eyes
a little wide and blank.

1108
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,290
Show no interest or excitement.

1109
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,784
Well, Sam,
we're finally with you.

1110
01:05:33,829 --> 01:05:35,023
They were supposed
to let me know.

1111
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:37,658
The chief said he'd phone
the station, then call me.

1112
01:05:37,700 --> 01:05:40,294
He phoned,
but the line was busy.

1113
01:05:40,336 --> 01:05:42,270
He's calling again now.

1114
01:05:43,606 --> 01:05:45,073
Aah!

1115
01:05:45,107 --> 01:05:46,574
Watch out!

1116
01:05:49,345 --> 01:05:51,074
I'm sorry, Miles.

1117
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,222
This is Janzek.
They got away.

1118
01:06:44,266 --> 01:06:45,494
Turn the main siren on.

1119
01:06:55,544 --> 01:06:57,307
Hey! Stairs!

1120
01:07:16,799 --> 01:07:18,824
It's only a few steps more.

1121
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,111
Come on!
They went this way!

1122
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:58,339
They're over there!

1123
01:09:24,393 --> 01:09:26,452
Miles, I can't.

1124
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:28,463
I can't go on.

1125
01:09:28,497 --> 01:09:30,328
Yes, you can.

1126
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:29,350
Here's her sweater!
They must be in the tunnel!

1127
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,168
Look, Tommy,
you go that way!

1128
01:10:48,677 --> 01:10:51,646
Give up!
You can't get away from us!

1129
01:10:51,680 --> 01:10:55,377
We're not going to hurt you!
Give up!

1130
01:11:05,995 --> 01:11:07,519
They're not in the tunnel.

1131
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,758
All right, everybody, outside.
Come on.

1132
01:11:09,798 --> 01:11:12,289
Let's check the hills.
Everybody, move.

1133
01:11:18,807 --> 01:11:23,244
Miles,
I can't stay awake much longer.

1134
01:11:24,947 --> 01:11:27,643
I think they're all gone now.

1135
01:11:27,683 --> 01:11:31,050
We'd better start, or we'll
never make it to the highway.

1136
01:12:29,244 --> 01:12:32,680
Miles, I've never heard
anything so beautiful.

1137
01:12:32,715 --> 01:12:34,046
It means we're not
the only ones left...

1138
01:12:34,083 --> 01:12:36,176
to know what love is.

1139
01:12:36,218 --> 01:12:39,381
Stay here, and pray
they're as human as they sound.

1140
01:12:39,421 --> 01:12:40,786
Bye, darling.

1141
01:13:35,277 --> 01:13:39,236
This is station KCAA,
the 24-hour platter parade...

1142
01:13:39,281 --> 01:13:40,578
the station of music...

1143
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,373
Becky.

1144
01:14:14,716 --> 01:14:15,944
Becky!

1145
01:14:20,689 --> 01:14:21,849
Becky?

1146
01:14:23,926 --> 01:14:25,689
Becky, where are you?!

1147
01:14:25,727 --> 01:14:27,422
I'm here, Miles.

1148
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:32,200
You didn't go to sleep?

1149
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:33,701
I'm so tired.

1150
01:14:33,735 --> 01:14:36,932
They weren't people.
It was more of them.

1151
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,633
They're growing thousands
of pods in greenhouses.

1152
01:14:38,674 --> 01:14:40,539
We've got to get away.

1153
01:14:40,576 --> 01:14:42,601
I'm exhausted, Miles.

1154
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,635
I can't make it.

1155
01:15:01,096 --> 01:15:03,758
We can't make it
without sleep.

1156
01:15:05,601 --> 01:15:07,592
Yes, we can.

1157
01:15:24,119 --> 01:15:28,078
I went to sleep,
Miles, and it happened.

1158
01:15:28,123 --> 01:15:29,920
Oh, Becky.

1159
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:33,057
They were right.

1160
01:15:33,095 --> 01:15:35,063
I should never have left you.

1161
01:15:35,097 --> 01:15:37,793
Stop acting like a fool,
Miles, and accept us.

1162
01:15:39,668 --> 01:15:40,965
No.

1163
01:15:42,337 --> 01:15:43,736
Never!

1164
01:15:43,772 --> 01:15:47,365
He's in here!

1165
01:15:47,409 --> 01:15:49,536
Get him! Get him!

1166
01:15:57,786 --> 01:16:00,653
I've been afraid
a lot of times in my life...

1167
01:16:00,689 --> 01:16:02,554
but I didn't know
the real meaning of fear...

1168
01:16:02,591 --> 01:16:06,618
until I had kissed Becky.

1169
01:16:06,662 --> 01:16:09,062
A moment's sleep,
and the girl I loved...

1170
01:16:09,097 --> 01:16:11,793
was an inhuman enemy
bent on my destruction.

1171
01:16:11,833 --> 01:16:14,267
That moment's sleep
was death to Becky's soul...

1172
01:16:14,303 --> 01:16:15,998
just as it had been
for Jack and Teddy...

1173
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:17,869
and Dan Kauffman
and all the rest.

1174
01:16:17,906 --> 01:16:19,430
Their bodies were now hosts...

1175
01:16:19,474 --> 01:16:22,875
harboring an alien form
of life, a cosmic form...

1176
01:16:22,911 --> 01:16:25,573
which, to survive,
must take over every human man.

1177
01:16:25,614 --> 01:16:27,377
So I ran, I ran...

1178
01:16:27,416 --> 01:16:29,850
I ran as little Jimmy
had run the other day.

1179
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:32,012
My only hope was to get away
from Santa Mira...

1180
01:16:32,054 --> 01:16:33,282
to get to the highway...

1181
01:16:33,322 --> 01:16:35,586
to warn the others
of what was happening.

1182
01:16:50,405 --> 01:16:52,202
Wait!

1183
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:54,708
Let him go!
They'll never believe him.

1184
01:16:54,743 --> 01:16:56,233
Help! Help!

1185
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:57,540
Wait!

1186
01:16:57,579 --> 01:16:59,911
Help! Help! Wait!

1187
01:17:01,116 --> 01:17:04,916
Wait! Stop!
Stop and listen to me!

1188
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:06,420
Listen to me!

1189
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:10,414
Those people that are coming
after me! They're not human!

1190
01:17:10,459 --> 01:17:12,359
Listen to me!
We're in danger!

1191
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,225
Get out of here!

1192
01:17:14,262 --> 01:17:16,730
You're in danger! Please!

1193
01:17:16,765 --> 01:17:18,357
Get out of here!
Go on!

1194
01:17:18,400 --> 01:17:19,833
Get moving!

1195
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:21,836
They're after all of us!

1196
01:17:21,870 --> 01:17:23,235
All of us!

1197
01:17:23,271 --> 01:17:24,932
Listen to me!

1198
01:17:24,973 --> 01:17:28,238
There isn't a human being
left in Santa Mira!

1199
01:17:29,511 --> 01:17:31,240
Stop!

1200
01:17:31,279 --> 01:17:33,747
Pull over! I need your help!

1201
01:17:33,782 --> 01:17:35,249
Something terrible's happened!

1202
01:17:35,283 --> 01:17:36,773
You're drunk!
Get out of the street!

1203
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:38,809
Get out of here! Go on!

1204
01:17:50,799 --> 01:17:53,290
Are you crazy,
you big idiot?

1205
01:17:53,335 --> 01:17:56,771
Look!
You fools! You're in danger!

1206
01:17:56,805 --> 01:17:59,273
Can't you see?
They're after you!

1207
01:17:59,307 --> 01:18:01,207
They're after all of us!

1208
01:18:01,243 --> 01:18:03,268
Our wives, our children,
everyone!

1209
01:18:03,311 --> 01:18:05,404
They're here already!

1210
01:18:05,447 --> 01:18:13,443
You're next!

1211
01:18:21,463 --> 01:18:24,523
You don't believe
a word of this, do you?

1212
01:18:24,566 --> 01:18:26,158
Sure, it's fantastic,
but it happened.

1213
01:18:26,201 --> 01:18:28,260
Don't just sit there
measuring me for a straitjacket!

1214
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:30,794
Do something! Get on the phone!
Call for help!

1215
01:18:32,407 --> 01:18:34,773
What's the use?

1216
01:18:50,392 --> 01:18:53,327
What do you think?
Will psychiatry help?

1217
01:18:53,361 --> 01:18:56,091
If all this
is a nightmare, yes.

1218
01:18:56,131 --> 01:18:57,428
Of course it's a nightmare.

1219
01:18:57,466 --> 01:19:00,435
Plants from another world
taking over human beings.

1220
01:19:00,469 --> 01:19:02,061
Mad as a March hare.

1221
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:07,105
What have we here?

1222
01:19:07,142 --> 01:19:08,837
He ran his truck
through a red light.

1223
01:19:08,877 --> 01:19:10,742
Greyhound bus
smacked him broadside...

1224
01:19:10,779 --> 01:19:12,007
and tipped him over.

1225
01:19:12,047 --> 01:19:13,412
Put him in the O.R.

1226
01:19:13,448 --> 01:19:15,211
Will you take over Bennell
for me?

1227
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:16,478
Certainly.

1228
01:19:16,518 --> 01:19:17,917
How badly is he hurt?

1229
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,478
Both legs, left arm,
broken all to bits.

1230
01:19:21,556 --> 01:19:23,148
We had to dig him out...

1231
01:19:23,191 --> 01:19:26,786
from under the most
peculiar things I ever saw.

1232
01:19:26,828 --> 01:19:28,125
What things?

1233
01:19:28,163 --> 01:19:29,289
I don't know what they are.

1234
01:19:29,331 --> 01:19:30,923
I never saw them before.

1235
01:19:30,966 --> 01:19:33,901
They looked like, uh,
great big seedpods.

1236
01:19:33,935 --> 01:19:36,233
Seedpods?

1237
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,761
Where was the truck
coming from?

1238
01:19:37,806 --> 01:19:39,137
Santa Mira.

1239
01:19:44,479 --> 01:19:47,778
Get on your radio
and sound an all-points alarm.

1240
01:19:47,816 --> 01:19:49,647
Block all highways
and stop all traffic...

1241
01:19:49,684 --> 01:19:52,175
and call every law enforcement
agency in the state.

1242
01:19:53,989 --> 01:19:56,958
Operator, get me the Federal
Bureau of Investigation.

1243
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:58,323
Yes, it's an emergency!
