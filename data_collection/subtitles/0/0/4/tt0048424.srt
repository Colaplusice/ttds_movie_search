2
00:00:53,135 --> 00:00:59,475
Dream, little one, dream

3
00:01:00,476 --> 00:01:06,816
Dream, my little one, dream

4
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:11,237
Oh, the hunter

5
00:01:11,237 --> 00:01:14,532
In the night

6
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:19,078
Fills your childish heart

7
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:22,790
With fright

8
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:28,546
Fear is only a dream

9
00:01:30,173 --> 00:01:35,178
So dream, little one

10
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:38,556
Dream

11
00:01:40,057 --> 00:01:43,102
Now, you remember, children,
how I told you last Sunday...

12
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:46,689
about the good Lord going up into the
mountain and talking to the people...

13
00:01:46,647 --> 00:01:50,776
and how He said, "Blessed are the pure
in heart, for they shall see God"...

14
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,447
and how He said that King Solomon
in all his glory...

15
00:01:54,405 --> 00:01:57,408
was not as beautiful
as the lilies of the field?

16
00:01:57,366 --> 00:02:01,204
And I know you won't forget,
"Judge not lest ye be judged"...

17
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:03,372
because I explained that to you.

18
00:02:03,372 --> 00:02:07,168
And then the Good Lord
went on to say...

19
00:02:07,126 --> 00:02:10,129
"Beware of false prophets...

20
00:02:10,129 --> 00:02:13,090
which come to you
in sheep's clothing...

21
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:16,552
but inwardly
they are ravening wolves.

22
00:02:16,469 --> 00:02:19,514
Ye shall know them
by their fruits."

23
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:21,641
Five, ten, fifteen, twenty,
twenty-five, thirty, thirty-five...

24
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:24,310
forty, forty-five, fifty, fifty-five,
sixty, sixty-five, seventy...

25
00:02:24,310 --> 00:02:27,730
seventy-five, eighty, eighty-five,
ninety, ninety-five, one hundred!

26
00:02:27,688 --> 00:02:29,982
Here I come, ready or not!

27
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:33,819
What's wrong?

28
00:02:33,819 --> 00:02:35,988
Hey! Hey!

29
00:02:45,581 --> 00:02:49,335
"A good tree cannot
bring forth evil fruit.

30
00:02:49,335 --> 00:02:53,089
Neither can a corrupt tree
bring forth good fruit.

31
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:56,801
Wherefore, by their fruits,
ye shall know them."

32
00:02:59,929 --> 00:03:02,515
Well, now, what's it to be, Lord?

33
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:04,892
Another widow?

34
00:03:04,892 --> 00:03:07,687
How many has it been? Six?

35
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:11,899
Twelve? I disremember.

36
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:19,240
You say the word, Lord,
I'm on my way.

37
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:30,793
You always send me money
to go forth and preach Your Word.

38
00:03:32,211 --> 00:03:36,424
A widow with a little wad of bills
hid away in a sugar bowl.

39
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,770
Lord, I am tired.

40
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:53,733
Sometimes I wonder
if You really understand, Lord.

41
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:58,696
Not that you mind the killings.
Your book is full of killings.

42
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:02,742
But there are things
You do hate, Lord.

43
00:04:02,742 --> 00:04:06,454
Perfume-smelling things,
lacy things...

44
00:04:06,454 --> 00:04:09,123
things with curly hair.

45
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:57,171
There are too many of them.
You can't kill a world.

46
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:02,260
You driving a touring car
with a Moundsville license?

47
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:05,012
Harry Powell, for the theft
of that touring car...

48
00:05:05,012 --> 00:05:08,182
you'll spend 30 days
in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

49
00:05:08,182 --> 00:05:10,893
- Preacher Harry Powell.
- A car thief.

50
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:15,147
Picked up where you were?
A man of God?

51
00:05:15,064 --> 00:05:16,524
Harry Powell.

52
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,967
- Hold Miss Jenny still.
- Stand still, Miss Jenny.

53
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,263
There. What's so hard about that?

54
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,186
Daddy!

55
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,444
- Where's your mom?
- Out shoppin'.

56
00:06:02,528 --> 00:06:04,864
- You're bleedin', Dad.
- Listen to me, John.

57
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:07,074
This money here-- We gotta hide it
before they get to me.

58
00:06:07,116 --> 00:06:09,327
There's close to $10,000.
Where?

59
00:06:09,368 --> 00:06:11,954
Under a rock in the smokehouse? No.

60
00:06:11,954 --> 00:06:15,500
In the bricks in the grape harbor.
No, they'd dig for it.

61
00:06:16,626 --> 00:06:19,754
Sure. That's the place.

62
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:27,303
- That's him.
- He probably still has that gun.

63
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:31,057
Listen to me, son. You've gotta swear.
Swear means promise.

64
00:06:31,015 --> 00:06:34,227
First, swear you'll take care of little
Pearl, guard her with your lif e, boy.

65
00:06:34,185 --> 00:06:37,063
Then, swear you won't never tell where
the money's hid, not even your mom.

66
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:38,814
- Yes, Dad.
- You understand?

67
00:06:38,814 --> 00:06:41,484
- Not even her?
- You've got common sense. She ain't.

68
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:43,611
When you grow up,
that money will belong to you.

69
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:46,531
Now stand up straight, look me
in the eye and raise your right hand.

70
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:48,783
Now swear,
"I'll guard Pearl with my lif e."

71
00:06:48,824 --> 00:06:50,952
I will guard Pearl with my lif e.

72
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:52,954
"And I won't never
tell about the money."

73
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,957
And I won't never tell
about the money.

74
00:06:55,957 --> 00:06:58,167
You, Pearl, you swear too.

75
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,630
Ben Harper.

76
00:07:04,131 --> 00:07:06,717
I'm going now, children.
Good-bye.

77
00:07:06,717 --> 00:07:09,178
Drop that gun, Harper.
We don't want the kids hurt.

78
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:12,306
Just mind what you swore, son.
Mind, boy.

79
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:18,980
Don't. Don't!

80
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,441
Dad.

81
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:47,049
Ben Harper, it is the sentence
of this court...

82
00:07:47,049 --> 00:07:50,136
that for the murder
of Ed Smiley and Corey South...

83
00:07:50,136 --> 00:07:53,055
you be hanged by the neck
until you are dead.

84
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:55,683
And may God have mercy
on your soul.

85
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:12,742
- It's mine.
- Where, Ben? Where?

86
00:08:15,536 --> 00:08:18,456
"And the little child
shall lead them."

87
00:08:18,414 --> 00:08:20,958
Come on, boy. Tell me.

88
00:08:24,545 --> 00:08:27,590
Ben, I'm a man of God.

89
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,635
Trying to make me talk about it
in my sleep.

90
00:08:30,593 --> 00:08:32,887
What'd I say? What? What?

91
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,889
You was quotin'
the scripture, Ben.

92
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:38,017
You said, "And the little child
shall lead them."

93
00:08:45,858 --> 00:08:49,820
- You killed two men, Ben Harper.
- That's right, preacher.

94
00:08:49,779 --> 00:08:52,073
I robbed that bank
'cause I got tired of seein'...

95
00:08:53,282 --> 00:08:56,410
children roamin' the woodlands
without food--

96
00:08:56,410 --> 00:09:00,623
children roamin' the highways
in this era of depression--

97
00:09:00,581 --> 00:09:04,335
children sleepin' in old abandoned
car bodies and junk heaps.

98
00:09:04,293 --> 00:09:07,839
I promised myself I'd never see the day
when my young 'uns would want.

99
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:10,258
With that $10,000,
I could build a tabernacle...

100
00:09:10,299 --> 00:09:13,636
make that Wheeling Tabernacle
look like a chicken house.

101
00:09:13,553 --> 00:09:16,013
Would you have free candy
for the kids, preacher?

102
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:19,392
Think of it, Ben.
With that cursed, bloody gold.

103
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,020
How come you got that stick knif e
hid up in your bed blankets, preacher?

104
00:09:22,979 --> 00:09:26,899
The Lord blinded mine enemies when
they brought me into this evil place.

105
00:09:26,816 --> 00:09:30,152
I smuggled it in right
under the noses of them guards.

106
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,283
I come not with peace,
but with a sword.

107
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:37,451
You, preacher?

108
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:41,164
This sword has served me through
many an evil time, Ben Harper.

109
00:09:45,126 --> 00:09:47,795
What religion
do you prof ess, preacher?

110
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:52,133
The religion the Almighty and me
worked out betwixt us.

111
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,051
I'll bet.

112
00:09:56,804 --> 00:09:59,891
Salvation is a last-minute
business, boy.

113
00:09:59,891 --> 00:10:02,143
Keep talkin', preacher.

114
00:10:02,185 --> 00:10:05,938
If you let that money serve the Lord's
purpose, He might f eel kind towards you.

115
00:10:05,855 --> 00:10:07,315
Keep talkin', preacher.

116
00:10:07,356 --> 00:10:11,110
Now, don't you think the Lord
might change His mind if you was to--

117
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:26,918
Lord, You sure knowed
what you was doing...

118
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:31,923
when You put me in this very cell
at this very time.

119
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:35,635
A man with $10,000 hidden somewhere...

120
00:10:35,551 --> 00:10:38,304
and a widow in the making.

121
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:56,405
- Any trouble?
- No.

122
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,950
He was a cool one, that Harper.
Never broke.

123
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,077
Carried on some, kicked.

124
00:11:01,077 --> 00:11:03,246
They say he left a wif e
and two kids.

125
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,289
I never heard.

126
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:09,210
- He never told about the money?
- No.

127
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,671
What do you figure
he done with it?

128
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,590
He took the secret with him
when I dropped him.

129
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,304
That you, Bart?
Supper's waitin'.

130
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:38,739
Mother, sometimes I think it might be
better if I was to quit my job as guard.

131
00:11:38,614 --> 00:11:43,327
You're always this way after a hanging.
You never have to be there.

132
00:11:45,454 --> 00:11:47,832
Sometimes I wish
I was back in the mine.

133
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:51,460
And leave me a widow after
another blast like the one in '24?

134
00:11:51,377 --> 00:11:53,796
Not on your lif e, old mister.

135
00:12:12,356 --> 00:12:17,153
Hing, hang, hung
See what the hangman done

136
00:12:17,111 --> 00:12:20,198
Hing, hang, hing, hang
Hing, hang, hung

137
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:23,075
See what the hangman done

138
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:27,330
Hung, hang, hing
See the robber swing

139
00:12:27,288 --> 00:12:30,958
Hing, hang, hing, hang
Hing, hang, hing, hang

140
00:12:30,917 --> 00:12:35,004
Hing, hang, hung
Now my song is done

141
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:38,758
Hing, hang, hung
See what the hangman done

142
00:12:38,716 --> 00:12:42,762
Hung, hang, hing
See the robber swing

143
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:59,445
Are you going to buy it, John?

144
00:12:59,445 --> 00:13:04,033
Oh, so your mommy's keeping you
out of school these days.

145
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:06,869
How is your poor, poor mother?

146
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:08,996
She's at Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor.

147
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:13,417
Did they ever find out what your father
done with all that money he stole?

148
00:13:16,212 --> 00:13:18,631
Pearl and me,
we have to go.

149
00:13:24,637 --> 00:13:26,889
- You better not sing that song.
- Why?

150
00:13:26,931 --> 00:13:29,267
'Cause you're too little.

151
00:13:30,351 --> 00:13:32,144
Can we get some candy?

152
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:42,864
Willa Harper, there are certain
plain facts of lif e that adds up...

153
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:45,867
just like two plus two makes four,
and one of them is this--

154
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:48,786
No woman is able to raise
growing youngsters alone.

155
00:13:48,744 --> 00:13:50,997
The Lord meant that job for two.

156
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:53,875
Icey, I just don't want a husband.

157
00:14:01,799 --> 00:14:03,801
It ain't a question
of wanting or not wanting.

158
00:14:03,843 --> 00:14:06,679
You're no spring chicken.
You're a grown woman with two children.

159
00:14:06,637 --> 00:14:09,390
It's a man you need
in the house, Willa Harper.

160
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:24,947
Tell me a story, John.

161
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,203
Well, once upon a time...

162
00:14:30,161 --> 00:14:34,832
there was a rich king who had himself
a son and a daughter.

163
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:40,379
They all lived in a castle
over in Africa.

164
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:48,888
And one day, this king
got taken away by some bad men.

165
00:14:48,763 --> 00:14:51,307
And before he got took off...

166
00:14:51,349 --> 00:14:55,311
he told his son to kill anyone
who tried to steal his gold.

167
00:14:57,104 --> 00:15:00,149
And before long,
the bad men came back and--

168
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:18,751
Leaning

169
00:15:20,253 --> 00:15:23,172
Just a man.
Good night, Pearl.

170
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:26,217
Sleep tight
and don't let the bedbugs bite.

171
00:15:26,175 --> 00:15:29,095
Good night, Miss Jenny.
Don't let the bedbugs bite.

172
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:33,766
Leaning

173
00:15:37,436 --> 00:15:44,694
Leaning on the everlasting Arm

174
00:16:24,901 --> 00:16:29,238
She don't put in here no more,
but she still blows as she passes.

175
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:36,370
Come on in and have
a cup of coff ee, boy.

176
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:39,207
Ain't nobody stole Dad's skiff.

177
00:16:39,207 --> 00:16:43,085
Ain't nobody gonna, neither,
long as Uncle Birdie's around.

178
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:49,383
First day my joints is limberin' up,
I'll go and give her a good caulkin'.

179
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:53,971
Ain't seen ya
in a coon's age, boy.

180
00:16:53,971 --> 00:16:57,517
- I've been mindin' Pearl.
- Shucks, ain't it a caution...

181
00:16:57,517 --> 00:17:00,937
what a woman will load
onto a man's back when he ain't lookin'?

182
00:17:13,991 --> 00:17:16,911
Excuse me, Cap,
while I sweeten' my coff ee.

183
00:17:27,964 --> 00:17:31,425
Dead and gone these 25 years,
and never takes her eyes off me.

184
00:17:34,762 --> 00:17:38,850
A man of my years needs a little snort
in the mornin', heat the boilers.

185
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:41,644
Yeah.

186
00:17:41,686 --> 00:17:44,689
I was talkin' to this stranger
up at the boardin' house.

187
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,817
- He knowed your dad.
- Where did he know Dad?

188
00:17:47,775 --> 00:17:51,362
I'll not hide it from you, boy. He
knowed in the Moundsville Penitentiary.

189
00:17:51,362 --> 00:17:56,075
- I gotta go now, Uncle Birdie.
- Well, you just got here, boy.

190
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:01,330
I told Mom I'd be back
to Spoon's for Pearl.

191
00:18:23,227 --> 00:18:27,231
God works in a mysterious way,
His wonders to perform.

192
00:18:27,190 --> 00:18:29,483
Yes, I was with Brother Harper
right up to the end.

193
00:18:30,902 --> 00:18:33,404
Now that I'm no longer employed
by the penitentiary...

194
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,157
it is my joy to bring
this small comfort to his loved ones.

195
00:18:36,157 --> 00:18:38,826
It's a mighty good man
would go out of his way...

196
00:18:38,826 --> 00:18:41,829
to bring a word of cheer
to a grievin' widow.

197
00:18:41,787 --> 00:18:46,209
- So you ain't with the state no more?
- No, brother, I resigned yesterday.

198
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:49,754
The heartrendin' spectacle of them
poor men was just too much for me.

199
00:18:50,796 --> 00:18:53,466
Ah, little lad,
you're starin' at my fingers.

200
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,220
Would you like me to tell you the little
story of "Right Hand, Left Hand--"

201
00:18:57,178 --> 00:18:59,305
the story of good and evil?

202
00:19:00,264 --> 00:19:02,391
"H-A-T-E."

203
00:19:02,433 --> 00:19:04,727
It was with this left hand
that old Brother Cain...

204
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,355
struck the blow
that laid his brother low.

205
00:19:07,396 --> 00:19:11,484
"L-O-V-E."
You see these fingers, dear hearts?

206
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:14,487
These fingers has veins that run
straight to the soul of man.

207
00:19:14,487 --> 00:19:17,448
The right hand, friends.
The hand of love.

208
00:19:17,406 --> 00:19:19,534
Now watch, and I'll show you
the story of lif e.

209
00:19:20,326 --> 00:19:24,705
These fingers is always a-warrin'
and a-tuggin' one again' the other.

210
00:19:25,623 --> 00:19:27,625
Now watch 'em.

211
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:31,754
Old Brother Left Hand.
Left Hand hates a-fightin'.

212
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:34,131
It looks like Love's a goner.

213
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,385
But wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

214
00:19:37,385 --> 00:19:41,889
Love's a-winnin'.
Yes, sirree.

215
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:43,975
It's Love that won...

216
00:19:43,933 --> 00:19:47,478
and old Left Hand Hate
is down for the count!

217
00:19:49,146 --> 00:19:51,983
I never heard it better told.

218
00:19:51,941 --> 00:19:56,112
I wish every soul in this community
could get the benefit.

219
00:19:56,904 --> 00:20:00,241
Oh, you've just got to stay
for our picnic Sunday.

220
00:20:00,241 --> 00:20:03,536
No, I must wend my way downriver
on the Lord's business.

221
00:20:03,494 --> 00:20:06,289
You ain't leavin' in no hurry
if we can help it.

222
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:10,334
John, mind your manners.
Take that look off your face. Act nice.

223
00:20:11,169 --> 00:20:13,754
Why, he don't mean
no impudence, do you, boy?

224
00:20:13,754 --> 00:20:15,548
Do you, boy?

225
00:20:16,507 --> 00:20:19,594
Many's the time poor Brother Ben
told me about these young 'uns.

226
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:21,095
What'd he tell you?

227
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:24,765
Why, he told me what fine little lambs
you and your sister both was.

228
00:20:24,765 --> 00:20:26,309
Is that all?

229
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,688
Why, no, boy.
He told me lots and lots of things.

230
00:20:30,605 --> 00:20:33,691
- Nice things, boy.
- Thank you.

231
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,654
My, that fudge smells yummy.

232
00:20:39,614 --> 00:20:41,699
It's for the picnic.

233
00:20:41,699 --> 00:20:46,704
And you don't get a smidgen of my fudge
unless you stay for the picnic.

234
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:50,875
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

235
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:55,463
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

236
00:20:55,379 --> 00:20:59,800
Sowing in the morning
Sowing seeds of kindness

237
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:04,347
Sowing in the noontime
and the dewy eve

238
00:21:04,222 --> 00:21:08,768
Waiting for the harvest
and the time of reaping

239
00:21:08,726 --> 00:21:13,689
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

240
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:17,693
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

241
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:22,031
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

242
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:26,536
Bringing in the sheaves
Bringing in the sheaves

243
00:21:26,452 --> 00:21:31,040
We shall come rejoicing
bringing in the sheaves

244
00:21:30,998 --> 00:21:33,960
Don't he have the grandest
singin' voice?

245
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,963
John, Pearl,
run along and play, you two.

246
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:39,257
- Where?
- Down by the river. My goodness!

247
00:21:41,384 --> 00:21:44,220
That f ella's just achin' to settle down
with some nice woman...

248
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:46,305
and make a home for himself.

249
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:48,933
Icey, it's awful soon
after Ben's passing.

250
00:21:48,933 --> 00:21:53,563
- If ever I saw a sign from heaven.
- John don't like him much.

251
00:21:53,521 --> 00:21:56,983
- Pearl dotes on him.
- The boy worries me.

252
00:21:57,817 --> 00:22:01,737
I know it's silly, but it's like there's
something still between him and his dad.

253
00:22:01,696 --> 00:22:04,323
What he needs
is a dose of sauce.

254
00:22:04,365 --> 00:22:07,285
- No, there's somethin' else.
- What?

255
00:22:07,243 --> 00:22:09,954
- The money.
- I declare, Willa Harper...

256
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:12,790
you'll let that money haunt you
to your grave.

257
00:22:12,790 --> 00:22:14,834
Icey, I would
love to be satisfied...

258
00:22:14,876 --> 00:22:17,753
that Harry Powell don't think I got
that money hid somewhere.

259
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:20,965
You come right out
and ask that man of God.

260
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:25,261
Mr. Powell! Clear that evil mud
out of your soul.

261
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:29,098
John! Pearl! Come along here,
get some fudge.

262
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:31,684
- I don't want no fudge.
- You do what you're told!

263
00:22:31,726 --> 00:22:35,062
- You go sit down by the river.
- Oh, Icey, I'm a sight.

264
00:22:35,021 --> 00:22:37,064
Get along with you.

265
00:22:41,944 --> 00:22:43,404
You!

266
00:22:45,573 --> 00:22:48,451
That young lady better look sharp,
or some smart sister...

267
00:22:48,451 --> 00:22:51,120
is gonna snap him up
right from under her nose.

268
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,247
She's not the only fish
in the river.

269
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:56,667
Now, you two stay put.
Shilly-shallying around.

270
00:22:56,626 --> 00:22:58,961
A husband's one piece of store goods
you never know...

271
00:22:59,003 --> 00:23:01,255
till you get it home
and take the paper off.

272
00:23:01,255 --> 00:23:06,219
Did Ben Harper ever tell you
what he done with the money he stole?

273
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:09,305
My dear child, don't you know?

274
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,808
She's moanin' about Ben Harper.

275
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:15,561
That wasn't love.
That was just flapdoodle.

276
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:17,522
Have some fudge, lambs.

277
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:19,565
When you've been married
to a man for 40 years...

278
00:23:19,607 --> 00:23:22,318
you know all that don't amount
to a hill of beans.

279
00:23:22,276 --> 00:23:26,239
I've been married to my Walt that long,
and I swear in all that time...

280
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:29,367
I just lie there
thinkin' about my canning.

281
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:49,512
A woman's a fool to marry for that.
That's somethin' for a man.

282
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:52,348
The Good Lord never meant
for a decent woman to want that.

283
00:23:52,348 --> 00:23:54,559
Not really want it.

284
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,520
It's all just a fake
and a pipe dream.

285
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,358
John, Mr. Powell
has something to tell you.

286
00:24:04,986 --> 00:24:09,740
Well, John, the night before
your father died...

287
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:13,244
he told me what he did
with that money.

288
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,830
That money's
at the bottom of the river...

289
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:19,458
wrapped around
a 12-pound cobblestone.

290
00:24:20,376 --> 00:24:22,128
Thank you, Harry.

291
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:25,882
I f eel clean now.

292
00:24:25,923 --> 00:24:29,218
My whole body's
just a-quiverin' with cleanness.

293
00:24:33,890 --> 00:24:36,017
John, come here.

294
00:24:36,017 --> 00:24:38,186
Your tie is crooked.

295
00:24:52,575 --> 00:24:55,953
Along the river shore

296
00:24:55,953 --> 00:24:59,582
Birdie Steptoe was a pilot

297
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:02,585
In the good ol' days of yore

298
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:07,131
Now he sets in his ol' wharf boat

299
00:25:07,089 --> 00:25:09,926
All the big boats heave a sigh

300
00:25:09,884 --> 00:25:13,095
- When will Dad's skiff be ready?
- Can't hear you, boy.

301
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:17,934
They blow for Uncle Birdie and

302
00:25:17,808 --> 00:25:22,480
The times that ere gone by

303
00:25:22,396 --> 00:25:24,398
When will the skiff be ready?

304
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:27,610
Have her ready inside a week,
and then we'll go fishin'.

305
00:25:27,568 --> 00:25:31,155
- How's your ma?
- Oh, she's all right.

306
00:25:31,113 --> 00:25:33,282
- How's your sister Pearl?
- Just fine.

307
00:25:33,324 --> 00:25:36,494
- You leavin', boy?
- Yep. Gotta watch out for Pearl.

308
00:25:36,452 --> 00:25:39,372
Well, good night, boy.
Come again anytime.

309
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:44,335
And mind, boy, I'll have your pa's skiff
shipshape inside a week.

310
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:15,950
Is somebody there?

311
00:26:26,085 --> 00:26:28,045
Anybody there?

312
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:33,301
Anybody here?

313
00:26:33,342 --> 00:26:35,511
Good evenin', John.

314
00:26:37,471 --> 00:26:40,558
I had a little talk
with your mother tonight, John...

315
00:26:40,516 --> 00:26:45,938
and your mother decided it might be best
for me to let you know the news.

316
00:26:45,855 --> 00:26:50,776
Your mother told me she wanted me
to be a daddy to you and your sister.

317
00:26:50,693 --> 00:26:52,820
We're gonna get married, boy.

318
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,993
Did you hear what I said, boy?
Married.

319
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:02,997
We're going to Sisterville tomorrow,
and when we get back--

320
00:27:02,914 --> 00:27:06,667
You ain't my dad.
You'll never be my dad.

321
00:27:06,626 --> 00:27:10,379
When we get back,
we're all going to be friends...

322
00:27:10,379 --> 00:27:13,299
and share our fortunes
together, John.

323
00:27:13,299 --> 00:27:16,802
You think you can make me tell,
but I won't, I won't, I won't!

324
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:23,267
- Tell me what, boy?
- Nothin'.

325
00:27:23,226 --> 00:27:26,812
We're not keeping secrets
from each other, are we, little lad?

326
00:27:30,775 --> 00:27:35,696
Well, no matter.
We've got a long time together, boy.

327
00:27:42,495 --> 00:27:45,873
Raise your hand! Great sakes!

328
00:27:45,790 --> 00:27:48,835
Now you wait here
while I get your night things.

329
00:27:53,923 --> 00:27:56,592
- Now can I tell?
- Hmm?

330
00:27:56,592 --> 00:27:59,971
Mr. Powell's our daddy now.
Can I tell him about--

331
00:27:59,929 --> 00:28:01,931
- You swore, Pearl.
- John, don't.

332
00:28:01,973 --> 00:28:04,058
You promised Dad
you wouldn't tell.

333
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:07,603
I love Mr. Powell
lots and lots, John.

334
00:28:38,509 --> 00:28:40,011
Men.

335
00:28:57,236 --> 00:28:59,238
Fix that window shade.

336
00:29:10,416 --> 00:29:13,336
I was praying.

337
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:17,798
I'm sorry. I didn't know.
I thought--

338
00:29:17,715 --> 00:29:20,635
You thought, Willa, that
the moment you walked in that door...

339
00:29:20,635 --> 00:29:23,763
I'd start to pawin' you
in that abominable way...

340
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:26,641
that men are supposed to do
on their weddin' night.

341
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,518
Ain't that right?

342
00:29:30,853 --> 00:29:34,023
I think it's time we made on thing
perf ectly clear, Willa.

343
00:29:34,023 --> 00:29:38,402
Marriage, to me, represents a blending
of two spirits in the sight of heaven.

344
00:29:50,540 --> 00:29:52,041
Get up, Willa.

345
00:29:54,418 --> 00:29:57,463
- Harry, what--
- Get up.

346
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:03,135
Now go look at yourself
yonder in that mirror.

347
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:06,931
Do as I say.

348
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:21,904
Look at yourself.

349
00:30:24,115 --> 00:30:26,868
What do you see, girl?

350
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:32,081
You see the body of a woman,
a temple of creation and motherhood.

351
00:30:31,998 --> 00:30:36,169
You see the flesh of Eve
that man since Adam has profaned.

352
00:30:36,127 --> 00:30:38,546
That body was meant
for begettin' children.

353
00:30:38,546 --> 00:30:41,883
It was not meant
for the lust of men.

354
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:46,429
Do you want more children, Willa?

355
00:30:48,806 --> 00:30:52,268
It's the business of this marriage
to mind those two you have now...

356
00:30:52,226 --> 00:30:54,187
not to beget more.

357
00:30:54,228 --> 00:30:55,688
Yes.

358
00:31:03,404 --> 00:31:07,200
All right, you can get in bed now
and stop shiverin'.

359
00:31:09,327 --> 00:31:11,537
Help me to get clean...

360
00:31:11,579 --> 00:31:14,749
so I can be
what Harry wants me to be.

361
00:31:22,131 --> 00:31:25,301
Meanest, orneriest, sneakiest critter
in the whole river, boy.

362
00:31:25,301 --> 00:31:26,761
The gar.

363
00:31:28,221 --> 00:31:31,265
- Here's your can of hooks.
- P'shaw, boy.

364
00:31:31,224 --> 00:31:34,810
Ain't a hook in the land
strong enough to land Mr. Gar.

365
00:31:34,769 --> 00:31:39,190
What a f ellow needs
is a mother wit and a horsehair.

366
00:31:39,106 --> 00:31:41,692
Golly, won't it bust it,
Uncle Birdie?

367
00:31:41,692 --> 00:31:45,071
No, horsehair'll hold
a lumpin' whale.

368
00:31:45,029 --> 00:31:47,573
- You mind my cussin', boy?
- No.

369
00:31:47,615 --> 00:31:51,577
Well, the reason I ask--
Your step-pa bein' a preacher and all.

370
00:31:54,747 --> 00:31:58,459
Never was much of a one
for preachin' myself.

371
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,545
I don't know what's wrong
up at your house...

372
00:32:00,545 --> 00:32:03,256
but always remember, cap...

373
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:06,801
if you're ever in trouble,
holler and come a-runnin'.

374
00:32:06,759 --> 00:32:09,011
Uncle Birdie's your friend.

375
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:19,146
There! You slimy, snag-toothed,
bait-stealin' so-and-so!

376
00:32:20,273 --> 00:32:22,066
Amen!

377
00:32:22,108 --> 00:32:24,777
You have all sinned!

378
00:32:24,819 --> 00:32:29,031
Which one of you can say,
as I can say...

379
00:32:28,948 --> 00:32:31,826
that you drove a good man
to murder?

380
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:34,203
Because I kept a-houndin' him...

381
00:32:34,162 --> 00:32:37,748
for perfume and clothes
and face paint.

382
00:32:37,748 --> 00:32:42,211
And he slew two human beings...

383
00:32:42,128 --> 00:32:45,298
and he come to me and he said...

384
00:32:45,298 --> 00:32:50,428
"Take this money and buy yourself
the clothes and the paint."

385
00:32:51,429 --> 00:32:54,432
But brethren, brethren...

386
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:57,185
that's where the Lord stepped in.

387
00:32:59,645 --> 00:33:00,771
Yes!

388
00:33:02,648 --> 00:33:06,027
He said, the Lord to that man...

389
00:33:05,985 --> 00:33:11,324
"You take that money
and you throw it in the river."

390
00:33:11,199 --> 00:33:15,161
- In the river!
- In the river!

391
00:33:37,558 --> 00:33:40,478
Now, you're John and you're Pearl.

392
00:33:42,355 --> 00:33:46,943
You'll get awful mad, John.
I done a sin.

393
00:33:46,901 --> 00:33:49,570
I didn't tell no one.

394
00:33:53,950 --> 00:33:55,827
It's all here.

395
00:34:14,512 --> 00:34:17,557
- Oh, yes?
- What are you doing, boy?

396
00:34:17,557 --> 00:34:21,352
- Gettin' Pearl to bed.
- What's takin' you so long about it?

397
00:34:21,352 --> 00:34:22,812
Nothing.

398
00:34:28,401 --> 00:34:31,946
- What's that you're playin' with?
- Pearl's junk.

399
00:34:31,904 --> 00:34:35,283
Mom gets mad when she plays out here
and don't put it away.

400
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:37,201
Come on, children.

401
00:34:40,872 --> 00:34:43,207
Off to bed with the both of you.

402
00:34:49,505 --> 00:34:51,507
Come here, John.

403
00:34:54,468 --> 00:34:57,054
Your mother tells me
you tattled on me.

404
00:34:57,054 --> 00:34:59,682
She said you told her
I asked where that money was hid.

405
00:35:02,143 --> 00:35:04,645
That wasn't very nice, boy.

406
00:35:04,604 --> 00:35:07,106
- Have a heart.
- Yeah.

407
00:35:08,566 --> 00:35:12,528
Well, it doesn't matter.
It's your word against mine.

408
00:35:12,487 --> 00:35:14,614
It's me your mother believes.

409
00:35:19,994 --> 00:35:22,955
Were you impudent again
to Mr. Powell, John?

410
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:25,249
Mom, I didn't mean it.

411
00:35:26,417 --> 00:35:28,920
What were you impudent about?

412
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:32,173
He asked me
about the money again, Mom.

413
00:35:32,173 --> 00:35:36,844
John, you always make up that lie.
There is no money.

414
00:35:36,761 --> 00:35:39,972
Why can't you get that
through your head?

415
00:35:39,931 --> 00:35:42,808
That boy's as stubborn
and as mulish as a sheep.

416
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,977
- It's a shame.
- Good night, Icey.

417
00:35:44,977 --> 00:35:47,104
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Walt.

418
00:35:47,104 --> 00:35:48,397
Good night, Willa.

419
00:35:50,525 --> 00:35:52,944
Plan on a longer visit next time.

420
00:35:52,944 --> 00:35:55,863
You hardly get settled before
you're frettin' to get home again.

421
00:35:55,822 --> 00:35:58,616
I'm needed to keep peace
and harmony betwixt them.

422
00:35:58,616 --> 00:36:01,536
It's my burden,
and I'm proud of it, Icey.

423
00:36:11,420 --> 00:36:15,132
- Where is the money hid?
- I don't know.

424
00:36:15,091 --> 00:36:18,010
She thinks that money's
at the bottom of the river.

425
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:20,596
But you and me, we know better,
don't we, little lad?

426
00:36:20,596 --> 00:36:22,723
I don't know nothin'.

427
00:36:22,723 --> 00:36:26,435
Well, never mind, boy.
Summer's young yet.

428
00:36:28,646 --> 00:36:30,106
Come here.

429
00:36:33,401 --> 00:36:35,486
John's a f ellow
that likes to keep secrets.

430
00:36:35,528 --> 00:36:38,072
- I'll tell you a secret.
- Yes?

431
00:36:38,114 --> 00:36:40,741
I knowed your daddy.

432
00:36:40,741 --> 00:36:43,828
And do you know
what your daddy told me?

433
00:36:43,828 --> 00:36:46,038
He said,
"You tell my little girl Pearl...

434
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:48,875
that there's to be no secrets
between her and you."

435
00:36:48,916 --> 00:36:52,587
- Yes.
- All right, now it's your turn.

436
00:36:52,545 --> 00:36:54,505
What secret shall I tell?

437
00:36:54,547 --> 00:36:57,216
Oh, uh, what's your name?

438
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:01,512
You're just foolin'.
My name's Pearl.

439
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:08,186
Well, I reckon I'll have to try again.
Where's the money hid?

440
00:37:10,605 --> 00:37:14,192
Pearl, you swore you wouldn't tell!
You swore! You swore!

441
00:37:14,192 --> 00:37:17,028
You hit Daddy with a hairbrush.

442
00:37:18,946 --> 00:37:22,575
Now, you see, we just can't have
anything to do with John.

443
00:37:22,533 --> 00:37:25,036
You and me'll go on down
to the parlor, Pearl.

444
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:45,973
John is just plumb bad,
through and through.

445
00:37:45,932 --> 00:37:49,143
- John's bad.
- Yes, John's bad.

446
00:37:50,144 --> 00:37:52,730
Tell me another secret
about my dad.

447
00:37:52,730 --> 00:37:54,649
Oh, no. Your turn.

448
00:37:54,690 --> 00:37:58,069
Well, like,
what secret shall I tell?

449
00:37:58,069 --> 00:38:00,571
Where's the money hid?

450
00:38:00,530 --> 00:38:03,658
- John's bad.
- Where's the money hid?

451
00:38:03,658 --> 00:38:07,578
Tell me, you little wretch,
or I'll tear your arm off!

452
00:38:19,841 --> 00:38:23,553
- Icey, I'm worried about Willa.
- How do you mean?

453
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,347
Well, I'm figurin' how to say it
so as you won't get mad.

454
00:38:26,347 --> 00:38:28,432
Say what, Walt Spoon?

455
00:38:28,474 --> 00:38:30,685
- There's somethin' wrong about it.
- About what?

456
00:38:30,685 --> 00:38:33,604
About Mr. Powell.
All of it.

457
00:38:33,563 --> 00:38:35,857
Now, Mother, a body's
got a right to their f eelings.

458
00:38:35,898 --> 00:38:39,277
May the Lord have mercy on you,
Walt Spoon.

459
00:38:39,277 --> 00:38:40,570
Mother, I was just--

460
00:38:44,657 --> 00:38:46,117
Amen.

461
00:38:47,994 --> 00:38:52,665
- Are you through praying?
- I'm through, Harry.

462
00:38:52,540 --> 00:38:55,293
You were listening
outside the parlor window.

463
00:38:55,251 --> 00:38:58,754
- It ain't in the river, is it, Harry?
- Answer me!

464
00:38:58,713 --> 00:39:02,675
Ben never told you
he throwed it in the river, did he?

465
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:14,896
The children know where it's hid.

466
00:39:14,937 --> 00:39:17,690
John knows.
Is that it, Harry?

467
00:39:22,528 --> 00:39:25,865
Then it's still here
amongst us...

468
00:39:25,865 --> 00:39:28,326
tainting us.

469
00:39:30,870 --> 00:39:34,207
You must've known about it
all along, Harry.

470
00:39:34,165 --> 00:39:38,002
But that ain't the reason
why you married me.

471
00:39:37,960 --> 00:39:40,004
I know that much.

472
00:39:41,547 --> 00:39:45,218
Because the Lord
just wouldn't let it be.

473
00:39:45,176 --> 00:39:48,179
He made you marry me...

474
00:39:48,137 --> 00:39:53,100
so you could show me
the way and the lif e...

475
00:39:53,017 --> 00:39:55,561
and the salvation of my soul.

476
00:39:57,355 --> 00:39:59,941
Ain't that so, Harry.

477
00:39:59,899 --> 00:40:03,861
So you might say that it was the money
that brung us together.

478
00:40:05,446 --> 00:40:07,782
The rest of it don't matter.

479
00:41:05,339 --> 00:41:06,799
Walt, come quick!

480
00:41:06,883 --> 00:41:09,719
- What's wrong, Mother?
- Shhh! He's in there.

481
00:41:09,677 --> 00:41:11,137
- Who?
- Mr. Powell.

482
00:41:11,179 --> 00:41:14,348
Willa has run away.

483
00:41:14,348 --> 00:41:15,892
Just went?

484
00:41:15,892 --> 00:41:18,728
She took off some time in the night
in that old Model-T.

485
00:41:18,686 --> 00:41:21,189
- Oh, is he hit pretty bad?
- All to pieces.

486
00:41:21,189 --> 00:41:23,357
Well, there's a little
peach brandy in here--

487
00:41:23,399 --> 00:41:27,069
- A man of the cloth?
- Well, just a sip.

488
00:41:26,986 --> 00:41:30,364
Walt Spoon,
that's for sickness in the house!

489
00:41:31,449 --> 00:41:32,909
What can we do, Mother?

490
00:41:32,992 --> 00:41:35,119
I thought if you went
and talked to him.

491
00:41:35,161 --> 00:41:37,747
Now, Mother, please.
I'm no good--

492
00:41:40,791 --> 00:41:44,712
- Mr. Powell.
- A strange woman is a narrow pit.

493
00:41:44,629 --> 00:41:48,883
She lieth in wait as for pray and
increaseth the transgressors among men.

494
00:41:50,134 --> 00:41:53,137
My dear, dear friends,
whatever would I do without you?

495
00:41:53,095 --> 00:41:56,390
- Mr. Powell.
- Well, if there's anything--

496
00:41:56,390 --> 00:42:00,144
No, it's my shame, my crown of thorns.
I must wear it bravely.

497
00:42:00,102 --> 00:42:03,689
- What could have possessed that girl?
- Satan.

498
00:42:03,648 --> 00:42:05,358
Didn't you have no inkling?

499
00:42:06,025 --> 00:42:08,861
Yes I did,
from the very first night.

500
00:42:08,861 --> 00:42:11,697
- First night?
- Our honeymoon.

501
00:42:11,656 --> 00:42:13,783
How's that?

502
00:42:13,825 --> 00:42:16,285
She turned me out of the bed.

503
00:42:16,285 --> 00:42:18,579
No!

504
00:42:18,538 --> 00:42:20,915
Well, what do you figure to do?

505
00:42:20,915 --> 00:42:25,169
Do? Why, just stay right here
and take care of them kids.

506
00:42:25,086 --> 00:42:28,464
Maybe it was never meant for a woman
like Willa to taint their young lives.

507
00:42:30,091 --> 00:42:32,051
That's mighty brave of you, preacher.

508
00:42:32,093 --> 00:42:35,888
Oh, I reckon it was just
ordained that way, Brother Spoon.

509
00:42:35,847 --> 00:42:38,558
Didn't she leave no word?

510
00:42:39,475 --> 00:42:43,396
A scrawl, on a notepaper
on the bureau.

511
00:42:43,354 --> 00:42:45,356
I burned it.

512
00:42:45,356 --> 00:42:49,193
Tore it up and burned it,
it stank so strong of hellfire.

513
00:42:49,110 --> 00:42:51,028
Amen!

514
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:54,365
The pitcher has went to the well
once too often, friends.

515
00:42:54,323 --> 00:42:56,993
Oh, she'll come
draggin' her tail back home.

516
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,955
She'll not be back.
I reckon I'm saf e in promisin' you that.

517
00:43:00,913 --> 00:43:03,207
- Maybe she just run offon a spree.
- Oh, no.

518
00:43:03,207 --> 00:43:06,377
- Well, there's no harm in hoping.
- Ain't no sense in it, neither.

519
00:43:08,004 --> 00:43:11,257
I figured somethin' like that was
brewin' when she went to bed last night.

520
00:43:11,174 --> 00:43:12,300
How?

521
00:43:13,801 --> 00:43:16,762
Well, she tarried around in the kitchen
after I'd gone up.

522
00:43:16,762 --> 00:43:21,100
- When I went to see what was wrong--
- What?

523
00:43:21,017 --> 00:43:23,978
Well, she'd found this jar
of dandelion wine...

524
00:43:23,978 --> 00:43:27,565
that the husband, that Harper,
had hid somewhere in the cellar.

525
00:43:28,983 --> 00:43:30,985
She was drinkin'.

526
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:35,740
- I tried to save her.
- I know you did, Mr. Powell.

527
00:43:35,698 --> 00:43:37,742
I know how hard you tried.

528
00:43:37,742 --> 00:43:40,703
But the Devil wins sometimes.

529
00:43:40,703 --> 00:43:44,207
Can't nobody say I didn't do
my best to save her.

530
00:44:43,266 --> 00:44:45,643
Leaning

531
00:44:48,354 --> 00:44:53,734
Saf e and secure from all alarm

532
00:44:53,609 --> 00:44:56,195
Leaning

533
00:44:58,656 --> 00:45:04,453
Leaning on the everlasting Arm

534
00:45:06,414 --> 00:45:08,124
Children!

535
00:45:28,394 --> 00:45:29,854
Careful.

536
00:45:31,355 --> 00:45:33,566
Why do we have to hide, John?

537
00:45:36,736 --> 00:45:39,155
- Where's Mom?
- She's gone to Moundsville.

538
00:45:39,197 --> 00:45:42,492
- To see Dad?
- Yes, I reckon that's it.

539
00:45:50,374 --> 00:45:53,461
Now, listen to me, Pearl.
You and me is runnin' off tonight.

540
00:45:53,461 --> 00:45:54,754
Why?

541
00:45:54,795 --> 00:45:58,382
If we stay here,
somethin' awful will happen to us.

542
00:45:58,299 --> 00:46:01,677
- Won't Daddy Powell take care of us?
- No.

543
00:46:01,636 --> 00:46:04,514
That's just it. No.

544
00:46:11,771 --> 00:46:14,732
- Where are we going, John?
- Somewhere. I don't know yet.

545
00:46:16,067 --> 00:46:19,237
- I'm hungry, John.
- We'll steal something to eat.

546
00:46:19,237 --> 00:46:21,614
It'll spoil our supper.

547
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:30,289
I can hear you whisperin', children,
so I know you're down there.

548
00:46:30,289 --> 00:46:33,334
I can f eel myself gettin' awful mad.

549
00:46:36,879 --> 00:46:40,967
I'm out of patience, children.
I'm coming to find you now.

550
00:46:40,883 --> 00:46:44,762
Yoo-hoo! Mr. Powell!

551
00:46:48,933 --> 00:46:53,855
- Well, well, Mrs. Spoon.
- Where are the children?

552
00:46:53,813 --> 00:46:56,065
They're down there
in that cellar playin' games.

553
00:46:56,065 --> 00:47:00,194
They won't mind me when I call them.
I'm at my wit's end, Mrs. Spoon.

554
00:47:10,621 --> 00:47:12,665
Shake a leg!

555
00:47:18,379 --> 00:47:21,048
Well, well, well. What's that?

556
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:24,677
Just a little hot supper
I fixed for you and the children.

557
00:47:24,635 --> 00:47:27,346
It seemed the least we could do.

558
00:47:28,681 --> 00:47:31,559
I won't have you worryin'
poor Mr. Powell another minute.

559
00:47:31,517 --> 00:47:34,729
Just look at you.
Dust and filth from top to toe.

560
00:47:34,729 --> 00:47:37,440
Want me to take 'em up
and wash 'em good?

561
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:41,903
No, thank you, dear Icey.
Thank you. I'll tend to them.

562
00:47:41,819 --> 00:47:46,491
Don't be too hard on them, preacher.
Poor, motherless children.

563
00:47:46,449 --> 00:47:50,703
Remember now, Mr. Powell,
don't be afraid to call on us.

564
00:47:57,126 --> 00:48:00,129
Good-bye, Mrs. Spoon,
and thanks again.

565
00:48:08,012 --> 00:48:11,974
Now, weren't you afraid, little lambs,
down there in all that dark?

566
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:31,035
They'll think it was me.

567
00:48:31,035 --> 00:48:34,372
They'll think it was
poor old Uncle Birdie.

568
00:48:37,083 --> 00:48:40,044
Oh, if you could've seen her, Bess.

569
00:48:41,128 --> 00:48:43,422
Down there in the deep place...

570
00:48:44,257 --> 00:48:47,009
with her hair wavin' soft and lazy...

571
00:48:47,051 --> 00:48:50,638
like meadow grass under floodwater.

572
00:48:51,806 --> 00:48:54,308
And that slit in her throat...

573
00:48:54,267 --> 00:48:57,019
like she had an extra mouth.

574
00:49:00,857 --> 00:49:04,777
You're the only human mortal
I can go to, Bess.

575
00:49:05,820 --> 00:49:10,324
If I go to the law,
they'll hang it on me.

576
00:49:16,414 --> 00:49:19,750
Sweet heaven,
save poor old Uncle Birdie.

577
00:49:25,798 --> 00:49:28,593
- I'm hungry.
- Sure.

578
00:49:28,593 --> 00:49:33,890
And there's fried chicken, sweet
potatoes, corn bread and apple cobbler.

579
00:49:34,891 --> 00:49:37,810
- Can I have my supper, please?
- Naturally.

580
00:49:37,810 --> 00:49:40,354
- Can I have milk too?
- Mm-hmm.

581
00:49:40,313 --> 00:49:43,858
But first we'll have a little talk
about our secrets.

582
00:49:43,816 --> 00:49:46,277
- No.
- And why not, pray tell?

583
00:49:46,277 --> 00:49:50,615
- 'Cause John said I mustn't.
- Never mind what John said!

584
00:49:50,573 --> 00:49:52,783
John's a meddler.

585
00:49:52,783 --> 00:49:55,203
Now, stop that snivelin'.

586
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:58,331
Here. Do you know what that is?

587
00:49:58,331 --> 00:50:01,709
Want to see something cute?
Now look.

588
00:50:02,710 --> 00:50:05,505
How about that?

589
00:50:05,505 --> 00:50:08,341
This is what I use on meddlers.

590
00:50:08,341 --> 00:50:10,635
John might be a meddler.

591
00:50:10,676 --> 00:50:14,013
No! No, little lamb,
don't touch it.

592
00:50:13,971 --> 00:50:16,349
Don't touch my knif e.
That makes me mad.

593
00:50:16,307 --> 00:50:19,227
It makes me very, very mad.

594
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:22,355
Now just tell me,
where's the money hid?

595
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:24,899
But I swore, I promised John
I wouldn't tell.

596
00:50:24,899 --> 00:50:27,860
John doesn't matter!

597
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:33,074
Can't I get that through your head,
you poor, silly disgusting wretch?

598
00:50:38,412 --> 00:50:41,123
There, now, you made me
lose my temper.

599
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:45,336
I'm sorry. I'm real sorry.

600
00:50:46,546 --> 00:50:49,757
Just tell me, where's it hid, honey?

601
00:50:49,757 --> 00:50:52,343
- I'll tell.
- I told you to keep your mouth shut.

602
00:50:52,301 --> 00:50:55,096
It ain't fair to make Pearl tell
when she swore she wouldn't.

603
00:50:55,137 --> 00:50:58,391
- I'll tell.
- Well, I declare.

604
00:50:58,349 --> 00:51:02,395
Sometimes I think poor old John
might make it to heaven yet.

605
00:51:02,353 --> 00:51:03,938
All right, boy,
where's the money?

606
00:51:03,980 --> 00:51:08,192
In the cellar, buried
under a stone in the floor.

607
00:51:08,151 --> 00:51:10,319
It'll go hard if I find
you're lying, boy.

608
00:51:10,319 --> 00:51:12,864
I'm not lying.
Go look for yourself.

609
00:51:15,158 --> 00:51:16,617
All right.

610
00:51:27,003 --> 00:51:30,464
- Come along.
- What?

611
00:51:32,425 --> 00:51:35,761
Go ahead of me, the both of you.

612
00:51:35,761 --> 00:51:38,514
Down those stairs.

613
00:51:41,767 --> 00:51:44,353
You don't reckon I'd leave here,
do you, boy?

614
00:51:44,353 --> 00:51:48,649
- Don't you believe me?
- Why, sure, boy. Sure.

615
00:51:51,694 --> 00:51:52,862
Where, now?

616
00:51:52,904 --> 00:51:57,158
Mind, no tricks, now.
I can't abide a liar.

617
00:51:57,116 --> 00:51:58,659
Yonder.

618
00:52:01,996 --> 00:52:03,539
Oh, no, you don't.

619
00:52:08,836 --> 00:52:10,463
Now, where, boy? Where?

620
00:52:10,463 --> 00:52:13,257
Under the stone on the floor.

621
00:52:22,308 --> 00:52:25,645
- This is concrete!
- John made a sin.

622
00:52:25,603 --> 00:52:27,605
John told a lie.

623
00:52:30,316 --> 00:52:32,902
The Lord's a-talkin' to me now.

624
00:52:32,902 --> 00:52:34,612
He's a-sayin'...

625
00:52:34,695 --> 00:52:38,282
"A liar is an abomination
before Mine eyes."

626
00:52:39,951 --> 00:52:41,494
Speak, boy.
Where's it hid?

627
00:52:42,662 --> 00:52:44,622
Speak!

628
00:52:44,664 --> 00:52:46,749
Speak, or I'll cut your throat
and leave you to drip...

629
00:52:46,749 --> 00:52:48,793
like a hog hung up
in butcherin' time.

630
00:52:49,085 --> 00:52:52,547
Pearl, Shut up!
Pearl, You swore!

631
00:52:53,756 --> 00:52:55,591
You could save him, little bird.

632
00:52:55,633 --> 00:52:58,719
It's on my doll!

633
00:53:01,597 --> 00:53:03,558
The doll!

634
00:53:06,602 --> 00:53:08,896
Why, sure.

635
00:53:08,896 --> 00:53:11,274
Last place anybody'd think to look.

636
00:53:38,885 --> 00:53:40,386
Uncle Birdie Steptoe.

637
00:53:41,554 --> 00:53:45,766
Open that door, you spawn
of the devil's own strumpet!

638
00:54:13,127 --> 00:54:15,129
Uncle Birdie!

639
00:54:20,009 --> 00:54:22,929
Hide us, Uncle Birdie!
He's a-comin' with his knif e!

640
00:54:25,890 --> 00:54:30,228
It's me. John Harper and Pearl.
You told me to come.

641
00:54:30,186 --> 00:54:31,854
Oh, please!

642
00:54:31,854 --> 00:54:33,856
Please wake up!

643
00:54:33,856 --> 00:54:37,193
I swear on the Book,
I never done it.

644
00:54:37,193 --> 00:54:39,153
I never--

645
00:54:52,792 --> 00:54:55,002
There's still the river.

646
00:55:02,802 --> 00:55:04,011
The skiff is under the willows.

647
00:55:23,906 --> 00:55:25,074
Children!

648
00:57:07,176 --> 00:57:09,678
Once upon a time

649
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:13,140
There was a pretty fly

650
00:57:13,098 --> 00:57:15,935
He had a pretty wife

651
00:57:15,935 --> 00:57:18,437
This pretty fly

652
00:57:19,271 --> 00:57:24,860
But one day she flew away

653
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:28,906
Flew away

654
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:31,951
She had two pretty

655
00:57:31,951 --> 00:57:34,787
Children

656
00:57:34,787 --> 00:57:36,997
But one night

657
00:57:37,039 --> 00:57:42,169
These two pretty children

658
00:57:42,086 --> 00:57:45,130
Flew away

659
00:57:48,592 --> 00:57:52,513
Into the sky

660
00:57:52,429 --> 00:57:58,519
Into the moon

661
00:58:13,701 --> 00:58:16,871
"Dear Walt and Icey,
I bet you've been worried...

662
00:58:16,871 --> 00:58:19,164
and gave us up for lost.

663
00:58:19,123 --> 00:58:21,333
Took the kids down here with me
for a visit...

664
00:58:21,375 --> 00:58:24,712
to my sister Elsie's farm.

665
00:58:24,670 --> 00:58:27,840
Thought a little change of scenery
would do us all a world of good...

666
00:58:27,798 --> 00:58:31,010
after so much trouble and heartache.

667
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:34,972
At least the kids will get
a-plenty of good home cookin'.

668
00:58:34,889 --> 00:58:37,057
Your devoted Harry Powell."

669
00:58:37,099 --> 00:58:39,310
Now, ain't you relieved, Walt?

670
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:41,645
Sure. But you was worried too, Mother.

671
00:58:41,645 --> 00:58:44,481
Takin' off with never a word
of good-bye.

672
00:58:44,481 --> 00:58:47,985
I got to figurin' maybe them gypsies
busted in and done off with all of them.

673
00:58:47,985 --> 00:58:50,613
You and your gypsies.
They've been gone a week.

674
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:54,742
Sure. But not before one of them knif ed
a farmer and stole his horse.

675
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,286
Never caught the gypsy,
nor the horse.

676
00:59:13,677 --> 00:59:16,931
Such times
when young 'uns run the roads.

677
00:59:16,889 --> 00:59:18,933
Go away, children.

678
00:59:25,814 --> 00:59:30,444
Hungry, I suppose. Well, I can't
spare you more than one potato apiece.

679
00:59:31,487 --> 00:59:34,198
- Where are your folks?
- I ain't got none.

680
00:59:34,156 --> 00:59:36,784
Oh, go away. Go away.

681
00:59:45,626 --> 00:59:49,129
An ungrateful child is an abomination
before the eyes of God.

682
00:59:49,046 --> 00:59:51,048
The world is fast
going to damnation...

683
00:59:51,048 --> 00:59:53,717
because of impudent young 'uns
flyin' in the face of age.

684
01:00:08,107 --> 01:00:10,401
I make soup out of them...

685
01:00:10,401 --> 01:00:13,112
but I wouldn't know how
to go about getting him open.

686
01:01:10,544 --> 01:01:12,963
We're gonna spend the night on land.

687
01:01:39,823 --> 01:01:44,036
Hush, little one

688
01:01:43,994 --> 01:01:46,539
Hush

689
01:01:47,998 --> 01:01:52,336
Hush, my little one

690
01:01:52,253 --> 01:01:55,214
Hush

691
01:01:56,382 --> 01:01:59,176
Morning soon

692
01:01:59,176 --> 01:02:03,973
Shall light your pillow

693
01:02:03,931 --> 01:02:07,059
Birds will sing

694
01:02:07,017 --> 01:02:09,436
In yonder

695
01:02:09,478 --> 01:02:12,022
Willow

696
01:02:12,022 --> 01:02:16,068
Hush, my little one

697
01:02:16,026 --> 01:02:18,737
Hush

698
01:02:19,905 --> 01:02:22,741
Are we going home now, John?

699
01:02:32,918 --> 01:02:37,006
Rest, dearest one

700
01:02:36,964 --> 01:02:39,925
Rest

701
01:02:41,302 --> 01:02:43,846
Rest here

702
01:02:43,888 --> 01:02:48,267
On my breast

703
01:02:49,727 --> 01:02:52,396
Little child

704
01:02:52,396 --> 01:02:57,401
With heart so brave

705
01:02:57,318 --> 01:02:59,904
Angel hosts

706
01:02:59,904 --> 01:03:05,075
Will keep you saf e

707
01:03:04,992 --> 01:03:09,330
Rest, my little one

708
01:03:09,246 --> 01:03:11,874
Rest

709
01:03:13,167 --> 01:03:17,838
Rest, little one

710
01:03:17,755 --> 01:03:20,966
Rest

711
01:03:59,338 --> 01:04:02,299
Leaning

712
01:04:05,553 --> 01:04:07,680
Saf e and secure

713
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:11,976
From all alarm

714
01:04:11,934 --> 01:04:15,312
Leaning

715
01:04:18,357 --> 01:04:20,943
Leaning on

716
01:04:20,985 --> 01:04:23,571
The Everlasting

717
01:04:23,529 --> 01:04:25,739
Arm

718
01:04:25,781 --> 01:04:28,450
What a f ellowship

719
01:04:28,450 --> 01:04:31,787
What a peace is mine

720
01:04:31,745 --> 01:04:33,038
Leaning on

721
01:04:33,080 --> 01:04:36,667
- The Everlasting Arm
- Don't he never sleep?

722
01:04:36,625 --> 01:04:39,128
What a blessedness

723
01:04:39,128 --> 01:04:41,422
What a joy divine

724
01:04:41,422 --> 01:04:44,550
Pearl! Wake up!
Come on! Pearl!

725
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:47,761
The Everlasting Arm

726
01:04:47,720 --> 01:04:50,431
Leaning

727
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:29,632
You two youngsters get up
to me this instant.

728
01:07:31,050 --> 01:07:34,261
Get on up to my house!
Mind me, now!

729
01:07:34,178 --> 01:07:36,263
I'll get me a switch.

730
01:07:50,736 --> 01:07:52,571
- Don't you hurt her!
- Hurt her, nothing.

731
01:07:52,613 --> 01:07:54,156
Wash her's more like it.

732
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:59,620
- Ruby! Clary! Mary!
- Yes, Miss Cooper?

733
01:07:59,495 --> 01:08:02,331
Bring your baskets.

734
01:08:06,293 --> 01:08:08,295
Nicely picked, Clary.

735
01:08:08,337 --> 01:08:11,090
Mary, put the big ones on top.

736
01:08:11,090 --> 01:08:13,384
Ruby, most of them ain't fit
to go to market.

737
01:08:13,384 --> 01:08:16,720
Well, put your baskets down.
Ruby, run to the house...

738
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,265
and f etch the tub
and put it by the pump.

739
01:08:19,223 --> 01:08:22,518
Clary, Mary, run up and f etch
a bar of laundry soap.

740
01:08:22,518 --> 01:08:25,187
- Yes, Miss Cooper.
- And a scrub brush.

741
01:08:25,187 --> 01:08:27,398
Come on up to the house, children.

742
01:08:29,441 --> 01:08:32,486
Gracious, if you ain't
a sight to beat all.

743
01:08:32,444 --> 01:08:34,446
Where are you from?

744
01:08:35,531 --> 01:08:37,074
Where are your folks?

745
01:08:37,157 --> 01:08:39,410
Come on. Speak up, now.

746
01:08:41,829 --> 01:08:44,748
Gracious, so I've got
two more mouths to f eed.

747
01:09:12,109 --> 01:09:14,445
Howdy, Miss Cooper.
What happened to our milk supply?

748
01:09:14,403 --> 01:09:16,280
Price of milk what it is,
not on your lif e.

749
01:09:16,322 --> 01:09:18,908
Do better makin' butter with the cream.
Sell it retail.

750
01:09:18,949 --> 01:09:21,368
Make smearcase for the children.
Feed what's left to my hogs.

751
01:09:22,494 --> 01:09:24,997
- She talks to herself.
- All the time.

752
01:09:25,039 --> 01:09:27,333
- Your ma's funny.
- She ain't our ma.

753
01:09:27,333 --> 01:09:30,294
- We just live at her house.
- Where are your folks?

754
01:09:30,252 --> 01:09:33,422
- Someplace.
- My daddy's in Detroit.

755
01:09:39,261 --> 01:09:42,973
Good morning, Miss Cooper. Guess what?
I'm savin' to buy you a charm bracelet.

756
01:09:42,932 --> 01:09:47,061
Never mind the talk. Don't forget your
visit Sunday. Come to church with us.

757
01:09:49,063 --> 01:09:51,649
See you Sunday, love.

758
01:09:51,649 --> 01:09:54,318
Take your baskets in, children.

759
01:09:54,318 --> 01:09:56,654
Reminiscent fools.

760
01:09:56,695 --> 01:09:58,113
All of 'em.

761
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:00,866
Look there.

762
01:10:02,034 --> 01:10:05,079
She'll be losing her mind
to a tricky mouth and a full moon...

763
01:10:05,037 --> 01:10:08,791
and like as not,
I'll be saddled with the consequences.

764
01:10:09,542 --> 01:10:11,210
Here's what you owe me.

765
01:10:12,836 --> 01:10:15,089
One, two, three, four, five.

766
01:10:15,130 --> 01:10:17,383
Where's the other basket?
Where's Ruby?

767
01:10:17,383 --> 01:10:21,053
- She went.
- John, you go find Ruby.

768
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:23,097
Big Ruby's my bothersome girl.

769
01:10:23,138 --> 01:10:25,099
She can't gather eggs
without bustin' 'em...

770
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:28,060
but she's got mother hands with
a young 'un, so what are you to say?

771
01:10:30,062 --> 01:10:31,981
How about tonight, Ruby?

772
01:10:32,022 --> 01:10:35,442
- What gives?
- The old lady's around.

773
01:10:35,401 --> 01:10:36,819
How about Thursday?

774
01:10:38,529 --> 01:10:42,241
The old gal thinks she comes in
for sewing lessons on Thursday.

775
01:10:42,157 --> 01:10:44,285
Miss Cooper wants you.

776
01:10:47,997 --> 01:10:50,374
And will you show me
your dolly, little lady?

777
01:10:52,001 --> 01:10:54,670
- I see you got two more to your brood.
- Yeah...

778
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:57,882
- and ornerier than the rest.
- How's your own boy, Miss Cooper?

779
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,676
Haven't heard from Ralph
since Christmas. Don't matter, though.

780
01:11:00,634 --> 01:11:03,429
I've got a new crop.

781
01:11:03,429 --> 01:11:06,932
I'm a strong tree
with branches for many birds.

782
01:11:06,932 --> 01:11:10,436
I'm good for something in this world,
and I know it too.

783
01:11:33,584 --> 01:11:35,377
Now, old Pharaoh...

784
01:11:35,461 --> 01:11:38,297
he was king of Egypt-land.

785
01:11:38,297 --> 01:11:40,299
And he had a daughter.

786
01:11:40,299 --> 01:11:44,762
And once upon a time...

787
01:11:44,637 --> 01:11:47,848
she was walkin' along by the riverbank,
and she seen somethin'...

788
01:11:47,848 --> 01:11:50,809
bumpin' and scrapin' along
on a sandbar...

789
01:11:50,809 --> 01:11:52,520
down under the willows.

790
01:11:52,561 --> 01:11:55,523
- And you know what it was, children?
- No.

791
01:11:55,523 --> 01:11:58,734
Now, it was a skiff
washed up on the bar.

792
01:11:59,735 --> 01:12:03,280
- And who do you reckon was in it?
- Pearl and John.

793
01:12:04,198 --> 01:12:07,159
Not this time.
There was only one young 'un--

794
01:12:07,159 --> 01:12:09,662
a little boy babe.

795
01:12:09,620 --> 01:12:12,748
- And you know who he was, children?
- No.

796
01:12:14,458 --> 01:12:17,670
It was Moses, a king of men.

797
01:12:17,628 --> 01:12:20,464
Moses, children.

798
01:12:20,422 --> 01:12:22,883
Now, off to bed with you.

799
01:12:22,883 --> 01:12:25,052
John, get me an apple.

800
01:12:42,152 --> 01:12:44,572
And get one for yourself too.

801
01:12:57,543 --> 01:12:59,753
John, where are your folks?

802
01:12:59,795 --> 01:13:02,381
- Dead.
- Dead.

803
01:13:03,924 --> 01:13:06,010
Where you from?

804
01:13:06,051 --> 01:13:07,720
Upriver.

805
01:13:09,388 --> 01:13:13,684
Didn't figure you'd rode that skiff
all the way up from Parkersburg.

806
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:30,075
Tell me that story again.

807
01:13:30,075 --> 01:13:33,287
Story? What story, honey?

808
01:13:33,287 --> 01:13:35,039
About them kings.

809
01:13:35,080 --> 01:13:38,959
And the queen found down on the sandbar
that time in the skiff.

810
01:13:38,918 --> 01:13:43,589
Kings? Why, there was only
one king, honey.

811
01:13:43,506 --> 01:13:46,509
I mind you said there was two.

812
01:13:46,509 --> 01:13:50,012
Well, shoot, now.
Maybe there was.

813
01:13:50,971 --> 01:13:53,724
Yes, come to think of it,
there was two.

814
01:14:19,959 --> 01:14:22,920
Must be Thursday.
Here comes Ruby.

815
01:14:29,885 --> 01:14:31,887
Here I go.

816
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:40,688
Why, you're Ruby,
ain't you, my child?

817
01:14:40,688 --> 01:14:42,940
- Can I have this?
- Surely.

818
01:14:42,940 --> 01:14:45,985
- I'd like to talk to you, my dear.
- Will you buy me an ice cream?

819
01:14:45,985 --> 01:14:47,903
- Of course.
- Watch out, Preacher.

820
01:14:47,945 --> 01:14:51,115
- Why, Preacher!
- Shut your dirty mouths.

821
01:15:02,459 --> 01:15:05,504
-Ain't I pretty?
-You're the prettiest thing I've seen...

822
01:15:05,504 --> 01:15:08,007
in all my wanderin'.

823
01:15:07,965 --> 01:15:10,718
Ain't nobody ever told you that, Ruby?

824
01:15:10,718 --> 01:15:12,636
No one never did.

825
01:15:13,512 --> 01:15:16,390
There's two new ones
out at your place, ain't there?

826
01:15:16,348 --> 01:15:17,808
Uh-huh.

827
01:15:18,684 --> 01:15:21,145
- What's their names?
- Pearl and John.

828
01:15:22,938 --> 01:15:26,942
- Is there a doll?
- Only they never let me play with it.

829
01:15:34,617 --> 01:15:37,870
Did you ever see such pretty eyes
in all your born days?

830
01:15:37,828 --> 01:15:41,165
- Don't let him get away, sugar.
- He ain't like you all.

831
01:15:41,123 --> 01:15:44,251
Next time I won't even ask him
to buy me an ice cream.

832
01:15:52,927 --> 01:15:54,887
I's been bad.

833
01:15:58,766 --> 01:16:00,935
Ruby, you didn't have money
to buy this.

834
01:16:00,976 --> 01:16:03,687
- You'll whip me.
- When did I ever?

835
01:16:03,687 --> 01:16:06,899
- This man at the drugstore, he gave--
- The drugstore?

836
01:16:08,442 --> 01:16:12,112
Miss Cooper, I never been
to sewing lessons all them times.

837
01:16:12,071 --> 01:16:14,657
What you been up to, Ruby?

838
01:16:14,698 --> 01:16:16,742
I've been out with men.

839
01:16:18,577 --> 01:16:20,037
Child.

840
01:16:24,625 --> 01:16:28,838
You were looking for love, Ruby,
in the only foolish way you knew how.

841
01:16:33,133 --> 01:16:35,678
We all need love, Ruby.

842
01:16:35,636 --> 01:16:38,264
I lost the love of my son.

843
01:16:38,305 --> 01:16:40,474
I found it with you all.

844
01:16:42,309 --> 01:16:45,646
You're gonna grow up to be
a strong, fine woman...

845
01:16:45,646 --> 01:16:47,982
and I'm gonna see that you do.

846
01:16:48,023 --> 01:16:52,653
The gentleman weren't like them. He just
give me a book and buy me ice cream.

847
01:16:52,570 --> 01:16:55,781
- Now, who was this?
- He didn't ask me for nothin'.

848
01:16:55,781 --> 01:16:59,660
- What did you talk about?
- Pearl and John.

849
01:16:59,618 --> 01:17:02,955
John and Pearl?
Is he their pap?

850
01:17:02,913 --> 01:17:05,791
I don't know.

851
01:17:05,791 --> 01:17:08,210
Wonder why he hasn't been
to the house.

852
01:17:26,312 --> 01:17:29,648
- Miss Cooper! Miss Cooper!
- What?

853
01:17:29,648 --> 01:17:32,109
The man! The man!

854
01:17:36,197 --> 01:17:38,032
Good mornin', ladies.

855
01:17:38,032 --> 01:17:41,952
- How do?
- Why, you're Miss Cooper, I take it.

856
01:17:41,911 --> 01:17:44,330
It's about that John
and that Pearl?

857
01:17:44,371 --> 01:17:46,582
Oh, them poor little lambs.

858
01:17:46,582 --> 01:17:49,084
To think I never hoped to see them
again in this world.

859
01:17:49,126 --> 01:17:51,921
Oh, dear madam,
if you was to know...

860
01:17:51,879 --> 01:17:56,800
what a crown of thorns I've borne
in my search for them strayed chicks.

861
01:17:56,717 --> 01:17:58,928
Ruby, go f etch them kids.

862
01:18:02,139 --> 01:18:05,351
Oh, madam, I see
you're looking at my hands.

863
01:18:05,309 --> 01:18:07,353
Would you like me
to tell you a story...

864
01:18:07,353 --> 01:18:09,855
of left hand and right hand,
the tale of good and evil?

865
01:18:09,855 --> 01:18:12,858
It was with this left hand that
old brother Cain struck the blow...

866
01:18:12,858 --> 01:18:15,569
- that laid his brother low.
- Them kids is yours?

867
01:18:15,611 --> 01:18:19,782
- My own flesh and blood.
- Where's your missus?

868
01:18:19,698 --> 01:18:24,495
She run off with a drummer
during prayer meeting.

869
01:18:24,411 --> 01:18:26,664
- Where's she at?
- Down the river somewheres.

870
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:30,334
Parkersburg or Cincinnati--
one of them Sodoms of the Ohio River.

871
01:18:30,292 --> 01:18:32,461
She took them kids with her?

872
01:18:32,503 --> 01:18:35,089
Heaven only knows
what unholy sights and sounds...

873
01:18:35,130 --> 01:18:37,132
them innocent
little babes has heard...

874
01:18:37,091 --> 01:18:39,552
in the dens of perdition
where she dragged 'em.

875
01:18:39,593 --> 01:18:43,472
Right funny, ain't it, how they rode
all the way upriver in a ten-foot boat?

876
01:18:46,100 --> 01:18:49,812
- Are they well, Miss Cooper?
- A sight better than they was.

877
01:18:51,230 --> 01:18:55,192
Gracious, gracious, you are
a good woman, Miss Cooper.

878
01:18:55,150 --> 01:18:57,820
How you figurin' to raise
them two without a woman?

879
01:18:57,778 --> 01:19:00,155
The Lord will provide.

880
01:19:00,197 --> 01:19:01,866
The Lord is merciful.

881
01:19:01,907 --> 01:19:04,285
Oh, what a day this is.

882
01:19:04,326 --> 01:19:06,370
And there's little John.

883
01:19:06,370 --> 01:19:09,290
- What's wrong, John?
- Come to me, boy.

884
01:19:09,290 --> 01:19:12,126
- What's wrong, John?
- Didn't you hear me, boy?

885
01:19:12,126 --> 01:19:14,753
John, when your dad says come,
you should mind him.

886
01:19:14,753 --> 01:19:16,755
He ain't my dad.

887
01:19:20,009 --> 01:19:23,262
No, and he ain't
no preacher, neither.

888
01:19:30,686 --> 01:19:33,689
Just march yourself yonder
to your horse, mister!

889
01:19:36,901 --> 01:19:38,736
March, mister!
I'm not foolin'!

890
01:19:42,281 --> 01:19:47,453
All right, but you haven't heard
the last of Harry Powell yet.

891
01:19:47,286 --> 01:19:50,748
The Lord God Jehovah will guide
my hand in vengeance!

892
01:19:52,374 --> 01:19:54,376
You devils!

893
01:19:55,836 --> 01:19:57,838
You whores of Babylon!

894
01:20:03,928 --> 01:20:06,514
I'll be back when it's dark.

895
01:20:15,606 --> 01:20:18,776
Leaning

896
01:20:22,071 --> 01:20:24,740
Saf e and secure

897
01:20:24,740 --> 01:20:28,827
From all alarms

898
01:20:29,537 --> 01:20:32,831
Leaning

899
01:20:36,585 --> 01:20:38,629
Leaning on

900
01:20:38,671 --> 01:20:43,342
The Everlasting Arms

901
01:20:44,426 --> 01:20:47,763
What a f ellowship

902
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:51,141
What a joy divine

903
01:20:51,141 --> 01:20:56,355
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms

904
01:20:56,272 --> 01:20:59,525
What a blessedness

905
01:20:59,483 --> 01:21:03,612
What a peace is mine

906
01:21:03,529 --> 01:21:09,660
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms

907
01:21:09,535 --> 01:21:12,830
- Leaning on Jesus
- Leaning

908
01:21:16,333 --> 01:21:20,629
Saf e and secure from all

909
01:21:20,588 --> 01:21:23,382
Alarms

910
01:21:23,382 --> 01:21:27,011
- Leaning on Jesus
- Leaning

911
01:21:30,681 --> 01:21:33,225
Leaning on

912
01:21:33,225 --> 01:21:39,231
The Everlasting Arms

913
01:21:40,733 --> 01:21:45,362
Shame on you, Ruby, mooning around
the house after that mad dog of a man.

914
01:21:46,822 --> 01:21:49,116
Merciful heavens!

915
01:21:49,909 --> 01:21:53,078
Ruby, go get the children out of bed
and bring them down here.

916
01:21:55,789 --> 01:21:58,209
Women is such durn fools.

917
01:22:17,019 --> 01:22:20,022
It's a hard world for little things.

918
01:22:41,126 --> 01:22:45,381
Now, there was this sneaking
no-account, ornery King Herod.

919
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:48,133
And when he heard tell of
little Jesus growin' up, he figured...

920
01:22:48,133 --> 01:22:51,470
"Well, shoot. There won't be
no room for the both of us.

921
01:22:51,428 --> 01:22:53,389
I'll just nip this in the bud."

922
01:22:53,430 --> 01:22:56,934
But he wasn't sure which of all those
babies in the land was King Jesus.

923
01:22:56,892 --> 01:22:59,478
So that cruel old
King Herod figured...

924
01:22:59,478 --> 01:23:03,315
if he killed all the babies in the land,
he'd be sure and get little Jesus.

925
01:23:03,274 --> 01:23:06,485
And when little King Jesus' ma and pa
heard about this plan...

926
01:23:06,485 --> 01:23:09,280
- what do you reckon they went and done?
- They hid in a broom closet.

927
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:13,450
- They hid under the porch.
- No. They went a-runnin'.

928
01:23:13,367 --> 01:23:17,329
Well, now, John, you're right.
That's just what they done.

929
01:23:17,288 --> 01:23:19,874
Little King Jesus' ma and pa
saddled a mule...

930
01:23:19,832 --> 01:23:22,418
and they rode all the way down
into Egypt-land.

931
01:23:22,376 --> 01:23:25,880
Yeah. And that's where the queen
found them in the billy rushes.

932
01:23:25,838 --> 01:23:29,133
Oh, no. That wasn't the same story
at all. That was little King Moses.

933
01:23:29,133 --> 01:23:33,137
But just the same, it did seem like
it was plague time for little ones.

934
01:23:33,053 --> 01:23:36,182
Them olden days.
Them hard, hard times.

935
01:23:42,938 --> 01:23:44,940
Figured I was gone, huh?

936
01:23:44,982 --> 01:23:48,027
Run! Hide in the staircase!
Run quick!

937
01:23:47,985 --> 01:23:50,404
Ruby, get!

938
01:23:50,446 --> 01:23:53,616
- What do you want?
- I want them kids.

939
01:23:53,574 --> 01:23:56,785
- What do you want them for?
- That's none of your business, madam.

940
01:23:56,785 --> 01:24:00,039
I'm givin' you till the count of three
to get out of here, then I'm shootin'!

941
01:24:15,846 --> 01:24:18,140
Miss Booher? Rachel Cooper.

942
01:24:18,140 --> 01:24:20,309
Get your state troopers
out to my place.

943
01:24:20,309 --> 01:24:22,937
I got something trapped
in my barn.

944
01:24:33,364 --> 01:24:36,534
- I'll go see to Pearl.
- I'll make coff ee.

945
01:24:46,168 --> 01:24:48,128
She's all right.

946
01:24:50,256 --> 01:24:52,591
John, you know, when you're little,
you have more endurance...

947
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:55,344
than God is ever
to grant you again?

948
01:24:55,344 --> 01:24:58,472
Children are man at his strongest.
They abide.

949
01:25:12,987 --> 01:25:15,823
- Why didn't you call us before now?
- Didn't want your dirty shoes...

950
01:25:15,823 --> 01:25:18,158
- trackin' up my clean floors.
- Is that him, ma'am?

951
01:25:18,200 --> 01:25:21,161
Yes. Mind where you shoot, boys.
There are children here.

952
01:25:21,120 --> 01:25:24,999
Harry Powell, you're under arrest
for the murder of Willa Harper.

953
01:25:26,959 --> 01:25:28,335
Drop that knif e.

954
01:25:30,838 --> 01:25:31,797
Don't!

955
01:25:37,928 --> 01:25:40,514
Here, here, take it back!

956
01:25:40,556 --> 01:25:44,476
Take it back! I don't want it, Dad!
It's too much!

957
01:25:44,393 --> 01:25:45,769
Here!

958
01:25:56,447 --> 01:25:59,325
Lynch him!

959
01:25:59,325 --> 01:26:02,328
- Bluebeard!
- Twenty-five wives!

960
01:26:02,286 --> 01:26:04,121
And he killed them all!

961
01:26:04,163 --> 01:26:07,291
- If the people of Marshall County--
- Bluebeard!

962
01:26:13,797 --> 01:26:16,300
Will you identify the prisoner?

963
01:26:16,342 --> 01:26:20,554
Please, little lad, won't you look
yonder and tell the court...

964
01:26:20,471 --> 01:26:23,140
if that is the man
that killed your mother?

965
01:26:30,397 --> 01:26:34,318
It's all right, Mrs. Cooper.
You can take the little f ellow away.

966
01:26:34,276 --> 01:26:36,695
Merry Christmas to you and yours,
Mrs. Cooper.

967
01:26:36,695 --> 01:26:39,949
And what's Santa Claus going to bring
you for Christmas, little man?

968
01:26:40,950 --> 01:26:42,785
Bluebeard!

969
01:26:51,669 --> 01:26:54,630
- There's Pearl!
- Get your coats.

970
01:26:54,588 --> 01:26:56,757
Them's her orphans!

971
01:26:56,799 --> 01:26:58,467
- Where's Ruby?
- She went.

972
01:26:58,509 --> 01:27:01,470
Them poor little lambs!

973
01:27:01,428 --> 01:27:05,766
Them is the ones
he sinned against, my friends!

974
01:27:05,724 --> 01:27:07,685
Go out the back door!

975
01:27:11,647 --> 01:27:14,275
Ain't we goin' to the bus depot?

976
01:27:15,568 --> 01:27:19,196
Draggin' the name of the Lord
through the evil mud of his soul!

977
01:27:19,154 --> 01:27:23,492
- String that Bluebeard up to a post!
- He's Satan hiding behind the cross!

978
01:27:23,450 --> 01:27:25,286
Come on!

979
01:28:10,331 --> 01:28:13,959
I love him.
You think he's like them others.

980
01:28:19,840 --> 01:28:21,967
You were so mad, you shot him!

981
01:28:38,067 --> 01:28:39,652
- Hey, Bart.
- Yeah?

982
01:28:39,735 --> 01:28:43,697
- We're savin' this bird up for you.
- This time it'll be a privilege.

983
01:29:09,598 --> 01:29:12,268
I'm glad they didn't send me nothin'.
Whenever they do, it's nothin' I want...

984
01:29:12,268 --> 01:29:16,063
but just somethin' to show me how fancy
and smart they've come up in the world.

985
01:29:22,653 --> 01:29:25,573
- Can we give you your presents now?
- Shoot.

986
01:29:25,531 --> 01:29:28,242
You don't mean to say
you got me a present.

987
01:29:28,242 --> 01:29:29,910
Shoot, now.

988
01:29:38,127 --> 01:29:40,421
A potholder.

989
01:29:40,462 --> 01:29:43,465
And it's much neater
than last year, Ruby.

990
01:29:46,844 --> 01:29:48,929
Another potholder!

991
01:29:48,929 --> 01:29:52,474
Now, ain't that thoughtful.
I'm always burning my hands.

992
01:29:54,518 --> 01:29:57,563
This doesn't look basted.
This looks made!

993
01:29:58,522 --> 01:30:01,233
And you finished the edge
with a chain-stitch.

994
01:30:01,233 --> 01:30:03,402
Oh, that's just dandy, Clary.

995
01:30:06,113 --> 01:30:08,115
Another potholder?

996
01:30:13,329 --> 01:30:16,248
Oh, now, did you two
make this together?

997
01:30:16,248 --> 01:30:17,917
You helped us some.

998
01:30:27,051 --> 01:30:30,179
That's the richest gift
a body could have.

999
01:30:31,096 --> 01:30:35,059
And your presents are in the cupboard
under the china closet.

1000
01:30:40,105 --> 01:30:42,107
This is yours.

1001
01:30:57,915 --> 01:31:00,751
Lord, save little children.

1002
01:31:00,709 --> 01:31:03,963
You'd think the world would be ashamed
to name such a day as Christmas...

1003
01:31:03,921 --> 01:31:07,049
for one of them and then go on
in the same old way.

1004
01:31:08,300 --> 01:31:13,013
My soul is humbled when I see the way
little ones accept their lot.

1005
01:31:14,223 --> 01:31:16,517
Lord, save little children.

1006
01:31:16,517 --> 01:31:19,854
The wind blows,
and the rains are cold.

1007
01:31:19,812 --> 01:31:21,564
Yet they abide.

1008
01:31:50,217 --> 01:31:52,595
That watch is sure
a fine, loud ticker.

1009
01:31:54,430 --> 01:31:58,184
Be nice to have someone around the house
who can give me the right time of day.

1010
01:31:59,310 --> 01:32:02,646
This watch is the nicest watch
I ever had.

1011
01:32:02,605 --> 01:32:06,567
Well, a fellow can't just go around
with run-down, busted watches.

1012
01:32:13,490 --> 01:32:16,076
They abide and they endure.
