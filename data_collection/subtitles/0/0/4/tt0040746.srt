1
00:02:20,587 --> 00:02:22,578
(Man Screaming)

2
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,984
Open it.

3
00:03:10,227 --> 00:03:12,183
Don't.

4
00:03:14,547 --> 00:03:17,584
- We've got to see if -
- I know.

5
00:03:18,147 --> 00:03:20,786
But not just yet.

6
00:03:21,307 --> 00:03:23,980
Let's stay this way for a minute.

7
00:03:43,707 --> 00:03:47,177
Phillip, we don't have too much time.

8
00:03:48,987 --> 00:03:53,663
It's the darkness that's got you down.
Nobody feels really safe in the dark.

9
00:03:53,827 --> 00:03:57,661
Nobody who's ever a child, that is.
I'll open these, alright?

10
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,256
There. That's much better.

11
00:04:09,587 --> 00:04:11,862
What a lovely evening.

12
00:04:16,867 --> 00:04:22,146
Pity we couldn't have done it with
the curtains open in the bright sunlight.

13
00:04:24,027 --> 00:04:25,779
Well...

14
00:04:26,667 --> 00:04:29,261
We can't have everything, can we?

15
00:04:29,427 --> 00:04:32,066
We did do it in daytime.

16
00:04:32,227 --> 00:04:34,024
Alright now, Phillip?

17
00:04:34,187 --> 00:04:35,017
- Yes.
- Good.

18
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:39,305
You better put those away in my
chequebook drawer behind the box.

19
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:58,578
Now...

20
00:04:58,747 --> 00:05:01,261
It's a museum piece now.

21
00:05:01,427 --> 00:05:04,146
We really should preserve it for posterity,

22
00:05:04,307 --> 00:05:08,459
except, it's such good crystal
and I'd hate to break up the set.

23
00:05:10,027 --> 00:05:16,182
Out of this,
David Kentley had his last drink.

24
00:05:17,467 --> 00:05:20,425
It should have been ginger ale,
or even beer.

25
00:05:20,587 --> 00:05:25,217
It was out of character for David
to drink anything as corrupt as whiskey.

26
00:05:25,387 --> 00:05:27,981
Out of character
for him to be murdered, too.

27
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:33,141
Yes, wasn't it? Good Americans
usually die young on the battlefield.

28
00:05:33,307 --> 00:05:37,744
Well, the Davids of this world
merely occupy space,

29
00:05:37,907 --> 00:05:42,901
which is why he was
the perfect victim for the perfect murder.

30
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:47,062
'Course,
he was a Harvard undergraduate.

31
00:05:47,227 --> 00:05:49,787
That might make it justifiable homicide.

32
00:05:49,947 --> 00:05:52,825
He's dead and we've killed him.
But he's still here.

33
00:05:52,987 --> 00:05:56,946
In less than eight hours
he'll be resting at the bottom of a lake.

34
00:05:57,107 --> 00:05:59,098
Meanwhile, he's here.

35
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:03,700
- What are you doing?
- It's not locked.

36
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:07,940
All the better. It's more dangerous.
And the lock's too old. It won't work.

37
00:06:08,107 --> 00:06:11,019
I wish it would.
I wish we had him out of here.

38
00:06:11,187 --> 00:06:13,337
I wish it were somebody else.

39
00:06:13,507 --> 00:06:16,783
It's a trifle late for that, don't you think?

40
00:06:16,947 --> 00:06:19,859
Whom would you have preferred,
Kenneth?

41
00:06:20,027 --> 00:06:22,825
I don't know,
I suppose anyone was as good...

42
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:25,262
or as bad as any other.

43
00:06:26,427 --> 00:06:29,897
You, perhaps. You frighten me.

44
00:06:30,067 --> 00:06:33,696
You always have,
from that very first day in prep school.

45
00:06:33,867 --> 00:06:36,859
Part of your charm, I suppose.

46
00:06:39,987 --> 00:06:42,023
I'm only kidding, Brandon.

47
00:06:42,187 --> 00:06:46,897
I obviously can't take it as well as you,
so I'm turning on you a little.

48
00:06:47,067 --> 00:06:52,095
- That's rather foolish, isn't it?
- Yes, very.

49
00:06:52,267 --> 00:06:55,339
May I have a drink now?

50
00:06:56,147 --> 00:07:00,220
By all means. This is an occasion.
It calls for champagne.

51
00:07:00,387 --> 00:07:02,617
- Champagne?
- I put some in the icebox.

52
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:06,223
- When did you put it there?
- Just before David arrived.

53
00:07:06,387 --> 00:07:08,947
- You knew it would work.
- Of course.

54
00:07:09,107 --> 00:07:12,463
You know I never did anything
unless I did it perfectly.

55
00:07:12,627 --> 00:07:15,425
I've always wished
for more artistic talent.

56
00:07:15,587 --> 00:07:17,737
Well, murder can be an art too.

57
00:07:17,907 --> 00:07:22,776
The power to kill can be just
as satisfying as the power to create.

58
00:07:24,107 --> 00:07:28,783
Phillip, do you realise we've actually
done it, exactly as we planned?

59
00:07:28,947 --> 00:07:32,656
And not a single thing has gone wrong.
It was perfect.

60
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:35,216
- Yes.
- An immaculate murder!

61
00:07:35,387 --> 00:07:38,902
We've killed for the sake of danger
and for the sake of killing.

62
00:07:39,067 --> 00:07:42,457
We're alive, truly and wonderfully alive.

63
00:07:42,627 --> 00:07:45,016
Champagne can't equal us,
or the occasion.

64
00:07:45,187 --> 00:07:46,620
I'll take it, though.

65
00:07:46,787 --> 00:07:48,698
You aren't frightened any more, are you?

66
00:07:48,867 --> 00:07:51,301
Neither of us can have fear.

67
00:07:51,467 --> 00:07:53,503
That's the difference
between us and them.

68
00:07:53,667 --> 00:07:56,340
They talk about committing
the perfect crime but don't do it.

69
00:07:56,507 --> 00:08:00,864
Nobody commits a murder just for...
the experiment of committing it.

70
00:08:01,027 --> 00:08:03,143
Nobody except us.

71
00:08:04,507 --> 00:08:07,226
- You're not frightened still, are you?
- No.

72
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:09,662
Not even of me?

73
00:08:10,227 --> 00:08:12,695
- No.
- That's good.

74
00:08:13,667 --> 00:08:17,706
You just astound me, as always.

75
00:08:17,867 --> 00:08:19,823
That's even better.

76
00:08:20,987 --> 00:08:23,262
To David, of course.

77
00:08:31,507 --> 00:08:34,305
- Brandon, how did you feel?
- When?

78
00:08:34,467 --> 00:08:36,059
During it.

79
00:08:37,227 --> 00:08:39,024
I don't know, really.

80
00:08:39,187 --> 00:08:42,623
I don't remember
feeling very much of anything,

81
00:08:44,307 --> 00:08:47,265
until his body went limp

82
00:08:48,227 --> 00:08:50,582
and I knew it was over.

83
00:08:50,747 --> 00:08:55,263
- And then?
- Then I felt tremendously exhilarated.

84
00:08:57,027 --> 00:08:59,700
H-How did you feel?

85
00:09:00,627 --> 00:09:02,743
Oh, l... I...

86
00:09:05,227 --> 00:09:09,937
- You don't think the party's a mistake?
- No, it's the finishing touch to our work.

87
00:09:10,107 --> 00:09:12,667
It's more.
It's the signature of the artists.

88
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:14,943
Not having it would be like, uh...

89
00:09:15,107 --> 00:09:17,860
Painting the picture and not hanging it?

90
00:09:18,027 --> 00:09:19,779
That's not a good choice of words.

91
00:09:19,947 --> 00:09:22,336
It may end up too choice,
thanks to the party.

92
00:09:22,507 --> 00:09:25,738
Oh, rot. This party will be
the most exciting ever given.

93
00:09:25,907 --> 00:09:28,182
- With these people?
- Oh, they're a dull crew.

94
00:09:28,347 --> 00:09:32,659
The Kentleys couldn't be duller if
they tried, but we did have to have them.

95
00:09:32,827 --> 00:09:36,422
After all,
they are David's mother and father.

96
00:09:36,587 --> 00:09:38,862
That doesn't make them
any easier to talk to.

97
00:09:39,027 --> 00:09:41,860
Don't worry.
Janet'll be buttering them up, poor girl.

98
00:09:42,027 --> 00:09:45,144
She's banked everything
on hooking David.

99
00:09:45,307 --> 00:09:49,095
Somehow, I don't think
she's going to succeed.

100
00:09:49,267 --> 00:09:53,055
- Do you?
- No, somehow I don't.

101
00:09:53,227 --> 00:09:55,787
Well, she can switch back
to Kenneth tonight.

102
00:09:55,947 --> 00:10:01,624
You must admit, it was most considerate
of me in view of recent events to...

103
00:10:07,347 --> 00:10:09,065
- Phillip?
- What?

104
00:10:09,227 --> 00:10:11,218
- Take the other one.
- What for?

105
00:10:11,387 --> 00:10:14,504
Never mind. Come with me.

106
00:10:14,667 --> 00:10:19,024
- What's this all about?
- You'll see. It's brilliant.

107
00:10:26,627 --> 00:10:28,583
What the devil are you doing?

108
00:10:28,747 --> 00:10:31,659
Making our work of art a masterpiece.

109
00:10:31,827 --> 00:10:35,024
- Brandon, you're going too far.
- Why? What do you mean?

110
00:10:35,187 --> 00:10:39,339
I just thought it'd be nice
to have supper in here...

111
00:10:40,507 --> 00:10:41,906
on this.

112
00:10:43,467 --> 00:10:45,617
Isn't it a good idea?

113
00:10:46,347 --> 00:10:50,226
Well, at least this way
no one will try to open it.

114
00:10:50,387 --> 00:10:53,060
I don't think you appreciate me, Phillip.

115
00:10:53,227 --> 00:10:54,865
I'm beginning to, Brandon.

116
00:10:55,027 --> 00:10:58,702
Come on, we don't have much time.
Mrs Wilson will be back soon.

117
00:10:58,867 --> 00:11:01,620
Did you forget to borrow her key?
I might've known -

118
00:11:01,787 --> 00:11:04,585
I didn't forget. I have her key.

119
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:07,056
- Oh, good.
- How are you going to explain this?

120
00:11:07,227 --> 00:11:09,695
- I'm not.
- We've got to have some excuse.

121
00:11:14,147 --> 00:11:17,617
- We can't leave our guest alone.
- We must have an excuse for the others.

122
00:11:17,787 --> 00:11:19,345
Let me think.

123
00:11:21,867 --> 00:11:26,338
Really, you get much too upset
much too easily, Phillip.

124
00:11:26,507 --> 00:11:29,897
We have a very simple excuse

125
00:11:30,067 --> 00:11:32,058
right here.

126
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:36,021
What are you worrying about, Phillip?

127
00:11:36,187 --> 00:11:38,781
Mr Kentley's coming
mainly to look at books.

128
00:11:38,947 --> 00:11:41,541
What could be better than having them
on the dining room table

129
00:11:41,707 --> 00:11:44,267
where the poor old man
can easily get at them.

130
00:11:44,427 --> 00:11:48,102
Considerate, aren't we? (Phone Ringing)

131
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:55,507
Hello? Oh, of course.

132
00:11:57,147 --> 00:11:58,899
- You start on the books -
- Who is it?

133
00:11:59,067 --> 00:12:01,262
Mrs Wilson.

134
00:12:18,947 --> 00:12:20,938
Brandon?

135
00:12:22,387 --> 00:12:24,343
Brandon!

136
00:12:26,027 --> 00:12:28,985
What the devil?
Don't you have any more sense than to...

137
00:12:29,147 --> 00:12:30,899
What is it?

138
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:33,979
- Well, go on, yank it out.
- I can't.

139
00:12:34,147 --> 00:12:36,377
If Mrs Wilson were here,
she'd yank it out for you.

140
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,540
A stupid display like that in front of
others will be as good as a confession.

141
00:12:40,707 --> 00:12:43,096
Take these and get ahold of yourself.

142
00:12:43,267 --> 00:12:45,337
If you'd let me keep the light on,
I would have seen it.

143
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:47,418
Alright! You're perfect.

144
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:48,815
We have to be, Phillip.

145
00:12:48,987 --> 00:12:53,902
We agreed there was only one crime we
could commit, that of making a mistake.

146
00:12:54,067 --> 00:12:57,264
- Being weak is a mistake.
- Because it's being human?

147
00:12:57,427 --> 00:12:59,987
Because it's being ordinary.
I won't let either of us do -

148
00:13:00,147 --> 00:13:02,138
(Door Buzzer)

149
00:13:10,267 --> 00:13:13,862
You owe me $2.40 for taxis,
including the tip.

150
00:13:14,027 --> 00:13:15,938
If it weren't for the traffic,
I'd have been here a half hour ago.

151
00:13:16,107 --> 00:13:18,860
It's just as well.
We didn't expect you back until now.

152
00:13:19,027 --> 00:13:21,382
I went to five stores
for the special pt we like.

153
00:13:21,547 --> 00:13:24,823
But the prices! I couldn't see any
reason for throwing away good money.

154
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:28,980
So, I went downtown to that little
delicatessen where Mr Cadell goes.

155
00:13:29,147 --> 00:13:32,537
But I tell ya, the next time
we give a party, I'm only going to -

156
00:13:32,707 --> 00:13:34,698
Good evening, Mrs Wilson.

157
00:13:38,187 --> 00:13:40,462
What, may I ask,
is happening to my table?

158
00:13:40,627 --> 00:13:44,063
We're just moving the things in here.

159
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:46,218
Well...

160
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:49,540
I personally
thought my table was quite lovely.

161
00:13:49,707 --> 00:13:50,901
Oh, it was quite lovely.

162
00:13:51,067 --> 00:13:56,460
But Mr Kentley is coming to look
at these old books I had in the chest.

163
00:13:56,627 --> 00:14:01,417
You wouldn't want the poor old man
to have to get on his knees to see them?

164
00:14:01,587 --> 00:14:03,384
Well, I think it looks downright peculiar.

165
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:04,946
- Peculiar?
- Very.

166
00:14:05,107 --> 00:14:07,701
Particularly those candlesticks.
They don't belong there at all.

167
00:14:07,867 --> 00:14:12,145
On the contrary, I think they suggest a...
a ceremonial altar,

168
00:14:12,307 --> 00:14:15,219
which you can heap with the foods
for our sacrificial feast.

169
00:14:15,387 --> 00:14:16,900
Hmph, heap is right.

170
00:14:17,067 --> 00:14:20,059
Isn't enough room for me to set
things out properly, is there, Mr Phillip?

171
00:14:20,227 --> 00:14:21,342
Oh, you can make it do.

172
00:14:21,507 --> 00:14:23,259
You two'll be the death of me.
What's to be done with the books?

173
00:14:23,427 --> 00:14:25,224
We'll lay them out
on the dining room table.

174
00:14:25,387 --> 00:14:27,423
A crazy idea, if you ask me.

175
00:14:27,587 --> 00:14:29,896
Well, I have too much to do
to discuss this thoroughly, dear.

176
00:14:30,067 --> 00:14:32,376
I still think it's peculiar.

177
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,458
- What on earth is the matter?
- I was sure she'd notice.

178
00:14:34,627 --> 00:14:36,697
- Notice what?
- The rope, of course.

179
00:14:36,867 --> 00:14:37,856
Brandon, we've got to hide it.

180
00:14:38,027 --> 00:14:39,426
- Why?
- Why?

181
00:14:39,587 --> 00:14:43,182
Yes, why? It's only a piece of rope,
an ordinary household article.

182
00:14:43,347 --> 00:14:45,417
Why hide it?

183
00:14:45,587 --> 00:14:48,226
It belongs in the kitchen drawer.

184
00:15:06,467 --> 00:15:07,661
- Mrs Wilson?
- Yes?

185
00:15:07,827 --> 00:15:09,340
There's champagne in the icebox.

186
00:15:09,507 --> 00:15:12,101
- We're not giving them champagne?
- We are.

187
00:15:12,267 --> 00:15:16,021
Oh, it's going to be that kind of party.
I'd better doll up a little.

188
00:15:16,187 --> 00:15:19,099
We only serve champagne
at Mr Cadell's on very high occasions.

189
00:15:19,267 --> 00:15:22,942
Matter of fact, he and I once had
a glass together on my birthday.

190
00:15:23,107 --> 00:15:26,816
Tonight, Mrs Wilson, you'll have
an opportunity to renew that romance.

191
00:15:26,987 --> 00:15:29,785
May l? Mr Cadell's coming.

192
00:15:29,947 --> 00:15:33,622
Oh, my. Oh, Mr Cadell is terribly nice.

193
00:15:33,787 --> 00:15:37,063
- Rupert's coming?
- Yes, I thought I told you.

194
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:39,866
No, you didn't.

195
00:15:40,027 --> 00:15:44,862
Some people say he's a little peculiar,
but I always thi...

196
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,495
Well, you might let me finish.

197
00:15:47,667 --> 00:15:50,420
I thought you liked Rupert.

198
00:15:50,587 --> 00:15:52,782
- I do.
- Well, then?

199
00:15:52,947 --> 00:15:56,656
Of all the people on this Earth, Rupert
Cadell is the one man likely to suspect.

200
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:59,864
He's the one man who might appreciate
this from our angle, the artistic one.

201
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,416
- That's what's exciting.
- I'm glad it excites you. It frightens me.

202
00:16:02,587 --> 00:16:05,101
I suggest you keep your voice down.

203
00:16:05,267 --> 00:16:08,737
It would have been too easy
with the others, Phillip, and too dull.

204
00:16:08,907 --> 00:16:13,025
As for Rupert,
I once thought of inviting him to join us.

205
00:16:13,187 --> 00:16:16,224
- Why didn't you? The more the merrier.
- He hasn't the nerve.

206
00:16:16,387 --> 00:16:18,298
Oh, intellectually,
he could've come along. He's brilliant.

207
00:16:18,467 --> 00:16:20,298
But he's a little too fastidious.

208
00:16:20,467 --> 00:16:23,220
He could've invented and admired
but he never could have acted.

209
00:16:23,387 --> 00:16:26,106
That's where we're superior.
We have courage. Rupert doesn't.

210
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:29,896
Mr Cadell got a bad leg in the war for his
courage. You've got your sleeve in the celery.

211
00:16:32,387 --> 00:16:34,742
(Door Buzzer)
They're here. Are we ready?

212
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:36,226
As ready as we'll ever be.

213
00:16:36,387 --> 00:16:39,220
Don't you be so busy
at that piano that you don't eat.

214
00:16:39,387 --> 00:16:40,615
You're getting too thin.

215
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:43,620
And don't you let them gobble up
that pt before you have any.

216
00:16:43,787 --> 00:16:46,938
Let's hope it's a success. Oh, my tray.

217
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:49,223
Take it in the kitchen.
I'll answer the door.

218
00:16:49,387 --> 00:16:53,062
There wouldn't be this last minute
hustle bustle if you'd kept my table...

219
00:16:53,227 --> 00:16:56,458
Now the fun begins.

220
00:17:00,227 --> 00:17:02,218
- Hello, come in.
(Kenneth) - How are you, Brandon?

221
00:17:02,387 --> 00:17:04,582
- Fine. Just put your hat there.
- Thank you.

222
00:17:04,747 --> 00:17:06,066
It's been quite a while.

223
00:17:06,227 --> 00:17:11,255
Yes, that's why I sounded so stupid
on the phone. Surprised, I guess.

224
00:17:12,227 --> 00:17:14,377
- Hello, Kenneth. Good to see you.
- You too.

225
00:17:14,547 --> 00:17:17,619
- Been up to much lately?
- Oh, nothing to speak of. You?

226
00:17:17,787 --> 00:17:22,417
Trying to get ready for exams. I have
to start cramming before everyone else.

227
00:17:22,587 --> 00:17:24,862
- Am I the first?
- You are.

228
00:17:25,027 --> 00:17:26,904
Why is it I'm always too early
at parties?

229
00:17:27,067 --> 00:17:28,898
Probably because you're always on time.

230
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,422
Mrs Wilson, champagne.

231
00:17:31,587 --> 00:17:32,576
Oh.

232
00:17:32,747 --> 00:17:35,784
It... It isn't someone's birthday, is it?

233
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:39,496
Don't look so worried, Kenneth.
It's really almost the opposite.

234
00:17:39,667 --> 00:17:40,463
The opposite?

235
00:17:40,627 --> 00:17:44,620
Phillip's bidding the world a temporary
farewell. I'm driving him to Connecticut.

236
00:17:44,787 --> 00:17:45,822
Oh. Where are you going?

237
00:17:45,987 --> 00:17:48,421
To Brandon's mother's place
for a few weeks.

238
00:17:48,587 --> 00:17:50,657
- I'm to be locked up.
- What?

239
00:17:50,827 --> 00:17:53,057
To make sure he practices
six hours a day.

240
00:17:53,227 --> 00:17:56,344
- I've finally wrangled a debut for him.
- Town Hall, at that.

241
00:17:56,507 --> 00:17:58,623
That's wonderful.
I hope you knock 'em dead.

242
00:17:58,787 --> 00:18:00,106
Thank you.

243
00:18:00,267 --> 00:18:02,906
Mmm. Most decorative.

244
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,937
Think so?

245
00:18:06,107 --> 00:18:08,337
- Hey.
- What is it?

246
00:18:08,507 --> 00:18:10,623
- I feel pretty honoured.
- Oh, why?

247
00:18:10,787 --> 00:18:13,221
Well, it looks like
a pretty small farewell party.

248
00:18:13,387 --> 00:18:16,299
Well, we're really killing two birds
with one stone.

249
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,298
The party's also for Mr Kentley.

250
00:18:18,467 --> 00:18:20,344
- David's father?
- Yes.

251
00:18:20,507 --> 00:18:23,943
Oh. Is... David going to be here?

252
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:27,099
- Of course.
- Who else is coming?

253
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:29,019
No one you don't know,
if that's what's bothering you.

254
00:18:29,187 --> 00:18:32,463
- The Kentleys, Janet Walker -
- Janet?

255
00:18:32,627 --> 00:18:35,824
Yes. I thought you'd be glad to see her.

256
00:18:36,867 --> 00:18:37,936
Won't you be?

257
00:18:38,107 --> 00:18:41,224
Brandon, Janet and I are all washed up.

258
00:18:41,387 --> 00:18:45,016
- Didn't you know?
- I'm sorry, I didn't.

259
00:18:45,187 --> 00:18:46,222
Well, you knew, Phillip?

260
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:50,585
Oh, I'd heard vague rumours, but I never
pay attention to that sort of thing.

261
00:18:50,747 --> 00:18:52,021
I wish you had. (Door Buzzer)

262
00:18:52,187 --> 00:18:55,941
- Why?
- Well, Janet and David are -

263
00:18:56,107 --> 00:18:57,984
(Janet) Hello, Mrs Wilson.

264
00:18:58,147 --> 00:18:59,296
- May l?
- Help yourself.

265
00:18:59,467 --> 00:19:04,063
Cheer up. I have a feeling your chances
with the lady are better than you think.

266
00:19:04,227 --> 00:19:06,900
- What do you mean?
(Brandon) - Janet.

267
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:10,461
Hello, ducks. Angel!

268
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,697
Be careful of my hair. It took hours.

269
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:17,019
- You smell dreamy. What is it?
- That swill you gave me last Christmas.

270
00:19:17,187 --> 00:19:20,259
- I knew I had good taste.
- You do. You look lovely.

271
00:19:20,427 --> 00:19:22,941
I won't by the time it's all paid for.

272
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,575
Was that funny?
I never know when I'm being funny.

273
00:19:25,747 --> 00:19:28,420
Whenever I try to be,
I lay the bomb of all time.

274
00:19:28,587 --> 00:19:31,021
- Phillip, sweet.
- Hello.

275
00:19:31,187 --> 00:19:33,655
What's this rumour
I hear about you and Town Hall?

276
00:19:33,827 --> 00:19:37,581
I bet you're going to play a foul trick
on all of us and become...

277
00:19:37,747 --> 00:19:38,736
horribly famous.

278
00:19:38,907 --> 00:19:41,944
I believe you've met.

279
00:19:42,907 --> 00:19:45,819
- Hello, Ken.
- Hello, Jan.

280
00:19:45,987 --> 00:19:49,616
That was fascinating, wasn't it?
I seem to have run down.

281
00:19:49,787 --> 00:19:52,460
What would you say
to some champagne?

282
00:19:52,627 --> 00:19:54,583
'Hello, champagne.'

283
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:57,784
You see what I mean
about trying to be funny?

284
00:19:57,947 --> 00:19:59,505
- How've you been, Ken?
- Fine, thanks.

285
00:19:59,667 --> 00:20:01,339
- How's the new job?
- What are you doing?

286
00:20:01,507 --> 00:20:05,182
Writing that same dreary column
on how to keep the body beautiful.

287
00:20:05,347 --> 00:20:09,579
- For whom this time?
- An untidy little magazine called Allure.

288
00:20:09,747 --> 00:20:11,465
Thanks, chum.

289
00:20:15,147 --> 00:20:18,537
- Oh, isn't that painting new?
(Brandon) - Yes it is. Do you like it?

290
00:20:18,707 --> 00:20:21,904
- Well, what is it?
- New Young American Primitive.

291
00:20:22,067 --> 00:20:23,625
I have a new young American sister.

292
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:26,779
She's three
and her stuff is really primitive.

293
00:20:26,947 --> 00:20:28,426
(Laughing)
(Janet quietly) - You dirty dog.

294
00:20:28,587 --> 00:20:33,024
(Brandon quietly) - Why?
- Didn't I notice another one in the foyer?

295
00:20:33,187 --> 00:20:36,020
I don't think so. Which?

296
00:20:40,907 --> 00:20:42,226
This.

297
00:20:44,307 --> 00:20:47,458
- I could really strangle you, Brandon.
- What have I done now?

298
00:20:47,627 --> 00:20:50,460
At times, your sense of humour
is a little too malicious, chum.

299
00:20:50,627 --> 00:20:52,185
What are you chattering about?

300
00:20:52,347 --> 00:20:54,542
- Why did you invite Kenneth?
- Well, why not?

301
00:20:54,707 --> 00:20:56,425
You know perfectly well why not.

302
00:20:56,587 --> 00:21:00,102
We called it quits ages ago and I'm
practically engaged to his best friend.

303
00:21:00,267 --> 00:21:02,656
- David?
- Yes, David.

304
00:21:02,827 --> 00:21:04,704
Which makes everything
just ginger-peachy.

305
00:21:04,867 --> 00:21:09,782
I'm terribly sorry, but it is difficult
trying to keep up with your romances.

306
00:21:09,947 --> 00:21:12,984
After me came Kenneth,
and now it's David.

307
00:21:13,147 --> 00:21:16,537
Why the switch
from Kenneth to David, anyway?

308
00:21:16,707 --> 00:21:21,542
- Obviously, I think he's nicer.
- Well, he's certainly richer.

309
00:21:21,707 --> 00:21:25,097
That's a new low even for you, chum.

310
00:21:25,267 --> 00:21:27,940
(Kenneth) - Gave me a 'D' in conduct.
(Phillip) - How's your drink doing?

311
00:21:28,107 --> 00:21:32,385
How many years has it been since I said,
'Oh, it tickles'? And don't you tell me.

312
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:35,698
- I hear Rupert's coming.
- He was invited, but you never know.

313
00:21:35,867 --> 00:21:37,983
- I hope he does. How is he?
- Who is he?

314
00:21:38,147 --> 00:21:41,537
Rupert Cadell
was our housemaster in prep school.

315
00:21:41,707 --> 00:21:43,857
Housemaster for you three little dears?

316
00:21:44,027 --> 00:21:47,861
Four little dears.
He tried valiantly to teach David, too.

317
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:49,460
Rupert's a publisher now, isn't he?

318
00:21:49,627 --> 00:21:51,458
Successful? Maybe he can give me a job.

319
00:21:51,627 --> 00:21:55,222
Rupert only publishes books he likes,
usually philosophy.

320
00:21:55,387 --> 00:21:58,140
Oh. Small print, big words, no sales.

321
00:21:58,307 --> 00:22:00,867
- Right.
- Rupert's extremely radical.

322
00:22:01,027 --> 00:22:03,177
Do you know that he selects
his books on the assumption that

323
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:06,305
people not only can read
but actually can think.

324
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:09,140
- Curious fellow, but I like him.
- You always did.

325
00:22:09,307 --> 00:22:12,299
Golly, those bull sessions you
and Rupert used to have in school.

326
00:22:12,467 --> 00:22:15,106
Brandon would sit up till all hours
at the master's feet.

327
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:18,020
Brandon at someone's feet!
Who is this Rupert?

328
00:22:18,187 --> 00:22:21,577
- He used to tell you the weirdest things.
- Really? What sort of things?

329
00:22:21,747 --> 00:22:27,219
I suppose Kenneth means Rupert's
impatience with social conventions.

330
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:32,415
For example, he thinks murder
is a crime for most men, but -

331
00:22:32,587 --> 00:22:34,498
- A privilege for the few.
- Yes.

332
00:22:37,387 --> 00:22:41,505
It's alright, Mrs Wilson,
I'll answer the door.

333
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:44,739
- Mr Kentley. So glad you could come.
- Thank you, Brandon.

334
00:22:44,907 --> 00:22:47,705
Mrs Kentley isn't well, so I took
the liberty of bringing my sister-in-law,

335
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,664
Mrs Atwater, who's staying with us.

336
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:52,819
- Delighted to have you.
- Delighted to come, dear boy.

337
00:22:52,987 --> 00:22:57,185
I've been in New York two weeks.
Alice has been ill almost the whole time.

338
00:22:57,347 --> 00:23:00,339
Henry is forever cataloging his library.

339
00:23:00,507 --> 00:23:03,419
Oh, no, Anita. Occasionally,
I even read one of my books.

340
00:23:03,587 --> 00:23:07,341
But I'm on a visit.
This is just my second party.

341
00:23:07,507 --> 00:23:10,624
- I suppose it's only fair -
- Let me take your things.

342
00:23:10,787 --> 00:23:12,857
- I'm sorry to hear Mrs Kentley's so ill.
- Oh, it's just a cold.

343
00:23:13,027 --> 00:23:15,461
Colds can be very dangerous
this time of the year.

344
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,505
I hope Mrs Kentley's staying
in bed with lots of fruit juice.

345
00:23:18,667 --> 00:23:20,544
- She is, thank you.
- Well, that'll do the trick.

346
00:23:20,707 --> 00:23:24,859
Colds dangerous, in this heat?
I don't understand that at all.

347
00:23:25,027 --> 00:23:27,587
Exactly two years ago
this summer I had one myself.

348
00:23:27,747 --> 00:23:29,817
I was down for three weeks.
The doctors -

349
00:23:29,987 --> 00:23:32,979
Excuse me. This way, Mrs Atwater.

350
00:23:33,147 --> 00:23:34,785
(Janet) ...particularly at parties.

351
00:23:34,947 --> 00:23:37,017
(Kenneth) This is over my head.

352
00:23:37,187 --> 00:23:38,506
David! (Glass Crunching)

353
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,498
(Brandon)
Uh, no, you've made a mistake.

354
00:23:40,667 --> 00:23:42,339
This is Kenneth Lawrence.

355
00:23:42,507 --> 00:23:43,701
(Mrs Atwater) Oh, I'm so sorry.

356
00:23:43,867 --> 00:23:45,380
(Henry) That's alright, Anita.

357
00:23:45,547 --> 00:23:49,984
Kenneth is often mistaken for David
even by people who aren't nearsighted.

358
00:23:50,147 --> 00:23:53,981
We haven't had much opportunity to
observe the resemblance lately, my boy.

359
00:23:54,147 --> 00:23:56,820
- Haven't been studying, have you?
- I've been trying to, sir.

360
00:23:56,987 --> 00:23:59,217
Oh, dear.
The resemblance is only physical.

361
00:23:59,387 --> 00:24:01,662
I believe you both know Miss Walker.

362
00:24:01,827 --> 00:24:03,385
Janet, my dear.

363
00:24:03,547 --> 00:24:07,142
I finished working out your horoscope
just before we came.

364
00:24:07,307 --> 00:24:10,617
- Oh, tell.
- The stars are very kind.

365
00:24:10,787 --> 00:24:13,745
They indicate a marriage very soon.

366
00:24:13,907 --> 00:24:18,185
to a tall, fair-haired young man
with a very lovely father.

367
00:24:18,347 --> 00:24:21,703
- Oh, Anita, I told you that a week ago.
- Oh, well, I suppose you did.

368
00:24:21,867 --> 00:24:24,586
- But the stars confirm it.
- Wonderful.

369
00:24:24,747 --> 00:24:26,817
(Brandon) Mrs Atwater,
may I present Mr Phillip Morgan?

370
00:24:26,987 --> 00:24:28,818
- How do you do?
- Oh, you've hurt your hand.

371
00:24:28,987 --> 00:24:31,057
- Oh, it's nothing, just a little cut.
- What happened?

372
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:33,787
Nothing. The glass was cracked
and it broke. That's all.

373
00:24:33,947 --> 00:24:37,064
- May I get you some champagne?
- Oh, I should adore some.

374
00:24:37,227 --> 00:24:40,025
Daddy used to have a glass
every morning at eleven.

375
00:24:40,187 --> 00:24:43,543
But of course, Henry doesn't like it.

376
00:24:44,027 --> 00:24:45,380
Mr Kentley, may I get you some?

377
00:24:45,547 --> 00:24:48,345
I'd prefer a little Scotch
with a lot of water, if you don't mind.

378
00:24:48,507 --> 00:24:50,816
Is David here?

379
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:53,820
I expected him to come with you.

380
00:24:53,987 --> 00:24:55,978
He called and said
that he'd meet us here.

381
00:24:56,147 --> 00:24:58,615
- Where did he call from?
- Our maid spoke to him.

382
00:24:58,787 --> 00:25:01,859
He was at the club,
studying for his examinations...

383
00:25:02,027 --> 00:25:04,018
In tennis.

384
00:25:04,587 --> 00:25:07,784
The trouble with David is, he doesn't
have to study. He's too bright.

385
00:25:07,947 --> 00:25:11,462
- David does alright, very much so.
- Thank you.

386
00:25:11,627 --> 00:25:15,859
- How's Mrs Kentley?
- As usual. It's a cold this time.

387
00:25:16,027 --> 00:25:19,144
I hope David arrives soon.
She wants him to call her.

388
00:25:19,307 --> 00:25:21,343
David's her only child, Mr Kentley.

389
00:25:21,507 --> 00:25:24,783
He's my only child too,
but I'm willing to let him grow up.

390
00:25:24,947 --> 00:25:26,938
Why don't I call
and tell her he's been detained.

391
00:25:27,107 --> 00:25:30,258
- No, you mustn't pamper her.
- David might have stopped to see her.

392
00:25:30,427 --> 00:25:32,099
- Mr Kentley?
- May I use the phone?

393
00:25:32,267 --> 00:25:34,223
- Of course. It's in the bedroom.
- How cosy.

394
00:25:34,387 --> 00:25:37,504
- Aren't you ready for another?
- I will be.

395
00:25:38,827 --> 00:25:40,897
I am, thank you.

396
00:25:41,067 --> 00:25:43,706
(Henry) What a charming young man.
I wish David saw more of him.

397
00:25:43,867 --> 00:25:47,382
(Janet) Yes. I'll go and call.

398
00:25:47,547 --> 00:25:50,015
Kenneth,
there's too much air in your glass.

399
00:25:50,187 --> 00:25:52,906
- Mine's fine, thanks.
- Would you mind taking this in to Janet?

400
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,819
Sure. Why?

401
00:25:54,987 --> 00:25:59,344
No particular reason. I thought you'd like
to take it to her. She's in the bedroom.

402
00:25:59,507 --> 00:26:02,226
- Then you'd like David to walk in.
- No, that'd be too much of a shock.

403
00:26:04,707 --> 00:26:06,299
(Atwater) - When were you born?
(Phillip) - July 14.

404
00:26:06,467 --> 00:26:10,255
- Can you really tell my future from that?
- I'm only an amateur astrologer.

405
00:26:10,427 --> 00:26:12,895
- I'm sure you're very good.
- I do my best.

406
00:26:13,067 --> 00:26:15,865
I suppose you want to know
if your concert will be a success.

407
00:26:16,027 --> 00:26:18,905
- Yes, I do.
- Let me see now.

408
00:26:19,067 --> 00:26:22,139
You were born on the 14th of July.

409
00:26:22,307 --> 00:26:25,265
You're Cancer, the crab.
You're a moon child.

410
00:26:25,427 --> 00:26:29,625
You're very much influenced
by the moon. May I see your hand?

411
00:26:29,787 --> 00:26:32,506
You don't remember the hour
of your birth, by any chance?

412
00:26:32,667 --> 00:26:33,986
No.

413
00:26:35,067 --> 00:26:38,662
Good fingers, strong, artistic.

414
00:26:39,587 --> 00:26:41,942
What about the concert?

415
00:26:42,107 --> 00:26:45,577
These hands will bring you great fame.

416
00:26:50,027 --> 00:26:53,224
(Henry) Well, I consider myself
a very fortunate man today.

417
00:26:53,387 --> 00:26:55,696
- I'm on hand for the grand opening.
(Brandon) - Of what?

418
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:58,859
- Of your collection, so to speak.
- Oh yes, of course.

419
00:26:59,027 --> 00:27:01,587
(Atwater)
Are you going to play? How lovely.

420
00:27:01,747 --> 00:27:04,545
(Janet) - Your wife sends her love.
(Henry) - David wasn't there ?

421
00:27:07,507 --> 00:27:10,146
No. He'll probably be here
in a minute, though.

422
00:27:25,067 --> 00:27:28,343
- Your touch has improved, Phillip.
- Rupert!

423
00:27:28,507 --> 00:27:31,499
I... I was beginning to think
you weren't going to show.

424
00:27:31,667 --> 00:27:33,623
You know me better than that.

425
00:27:33,787 --> 00:27:36,540
Mrs Atwater,
may I present Mr Rupert Cadell.

426
00:27:36,707 --> 00:27:37,935
- Delighted.
- Thank you.

427
00:27:38,107 --> 00:27:40,063
- Mr Kentley.
- How do you do, Mr Kentley?

428
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:42,343
Rupert Cadell,
the housemaster at Somerville?

429
00:27:42,507 --> 00:27:45,465
- I used to be.
- You must have taught my son, David.

430
00:27:45,627 --> 00:27:47,982
- You flatter me. How do you do?
- Hello, chum.

431
00:27:48,147 --> 00:27:50,217
- Oh, Miss Walker.
- How'd you know?

432
00:27:50,387 --> 00:27:52,901
- Brandon spoke of you.
- Did he do me justice?

433
00:27:53,067 --> 00:27:56,264
Do you deserve justice? Well!

434
00:27:56,427 --> 00:27:59,100
Well, little Kenneth Lawrence,
how you've grown.

435
00:27:59,267 --> 00:28:02,782
- Hello, er...
- Kenneth, school's out. You can say it.

436
00:28:02,947 --> 00:28:05,859
Rupert, you're the same as ever.
It's awfully good to see you again.

437
00:28:06,027 --> 00:28:08,700
- Why?
- Uh, well...

438
00:28:08,867 --> 00:28:12,018
Don't mind me.
Very pleased to see you again.

439
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:15,020
And that bears a curious
resemblance to champagne.

440
00:28:15,187 --> 00:28:17,337
- It is.
- Very good champagne.

441
00:28:17,507 --> 00:28:20,067
- What's the occasion?
- I told you on the phone.

442
00:28:20,227 --> 00:28:24,345
It began as a little party for Mr Kentley
so he could look over the first editions.

443
00:28:24,507 --> 00:28:26,543
Then it turned out Phillip
and I were going to the country -

444
00:28:26,707 --> 00:28:28,379
Yes, you told me that too, Brandon.

445
00:28:28,547 --> 00:28:29,775
- Did l?
- Yeah.

446
00:28:29,947 --> 00:28:32,939
Well, I thought I'd make it
sort of a farewell for Phillip.

447
00:28:33,107 --> 00:28:34,938
- Therefore, champagne.
- Yes.

448
00:28:35,107 --> 00:28:37,985
- I see.
- Well, it's true.

449
00:28:38,147 --> 00:28:41,059
You always did stutter
when you were excited.

450
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:43,900
Well, l-l guess I'm always excited
when I give a party.

451
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:45,580
- Really?
- Mr Cadell.

452
00:28:45,747 --> 00:28:48,181
Oh, Mrs Wilson.

453
00:28:48,347 --> 00:28:50,622
Well, what have we here?

454
00:28:50,787 --> 00:28:52,539
(Whispering)
I got that special pt you like.

455
00:28:52,707 --> 00:28:54,538
(Whispering) - I don't like it anymore.
- Oh, no!

456
00:28:54,707 --> 00:28:56,584
No, I'm just teasing, just teasing.

457
00:28:56,747 --> 00:29:00,057
- You're awful.
- Thank you. Thank you.

458
00:29:00,227 --> 00:29:01,899
You'd better get along with the carving.

459
00:29:02,067 --> 00:29:04,183
The rest of the things'll be here
in two shakes.

460
00:29:04,347 --> 00:29:06,338
Oh, Mr Brandon, I found it.

461
00:29:06,507 --> 00:29:09,021
I haven't the least notion
what it was she lost.

462
00:29:09,187 --> 00:29:11,906
Wonderful Mrs Wilson.

463
00:29:12,067 --> 00:29:14,183
I may marry her.

464
00:29:14,347 --> 00:29:16,781
It looks heavenly.
I hope David gets here soon.

465
00:29:16,947 --> 00:29:19,415
- Yes, where is David?
- I haven't the faintest idea.

466
00:29:19,587 --> 00:29:21,817
But he's so late,
Mr Kentley's getting annoyed.

467
00:29:21,987 --> 00:29:25,024
- And you?
- Me? I'm hungry?

468
00:29:25,187 --> 00:29:27,382
Brandon, exactly what is this?

469
00:29:27,547 --> 00:29:30,698
- A cassone I got in ltaly.
- No, I mean why are we eating off it?

470
00:29:30,867 --> 00:29:34,064
Oh, I've turned
the dining room into a library.

471
00:29:34,227 --> 00:29:36,297
Trust you to find a new use
for a chest.

472
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:40,426
One was always turning up in the
bedtime stories he told in prep school.

473
00:29:40,587 --> 00:29:44,978
"The Mistletoe Bough,"
that was your favourite tale, wasn't it?

474
00:29:45,147 --> 00:29:48,423
- What was that one about?
- I don't quite remember how it started.

475
00:29:48,587 --> 00:29:51,021
- It was about a lovely, young girl -
- She was a bride-to-be.

476
00:29:51,187 --> 00:29:53,906
On her wedding day,
she playfully hid herself in a chest.

477
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,025
- Yes, that's right.
- Unfortunately, it had a spring lock.

478
00:29:57,187 --> 00:29:59,542
Fifty years later,
they found her skeleton.

479
00:29:59,707 --> 00:30:02,904
- I don't think I'll get that playful.
- Would you all please help yourselves?

480
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:06,537
Talking of skeletons, have you seen
that new thing at the Strand?

481
00:30:06,707 --> 00:30:08,937
- Yes, I adored it.
- Did you? Good.

482
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:12,179
I didn't like the new girl much.
Definitely Scorpio.

483
00:30:12,347 --> 00:30:15,100
No, I didn't like her either,
but her clothes were fabulous.

484
00:30:15,267 --> 00:30:17,622
- Simply divine!
- Absolute heaven!

485
00:30:17,787 --> 00:30:21,302
- I must see it.
- I have a passion for James Mason.

486
00:30:21,467 --> 00:30:23,537
- Is he good?
- Absolutely terrific.

487
00:30:23,707 --> 00:30:27,222
So attractively sinister!
Taurus, the bull, you know.

488
00:30:27,387 --> 00:30:28,866
- Very obstinate.
- Really?

489
00:30:29,027 --> 00:30:30,585
But I have a confession to make.

490
00:30:30,747 --> 00:30:34,501
Do you know, I think I like Mason
as much as Errol Flynn?

491
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:38,182
- I'll take Cary Grant, myself.
- Oh, so will l.

492
00:30:38,347 --> 00:30:41,498
Capricorn, the goat. He leaps, divine!

493
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:43,419
- So much "oomph."
- Yes.

494
00:30:43,587 --> 00:30:47,739
- Absolutely.
- He was thrilling with Bergman.

495
00:30:47,907 --> 00:30:51,058
What was it called?
"Something of the something."

496
00:30:51,227 --> 00:30:54,822
No, that's the other one.
This was just plain "Something."

497
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:57,023
You know, it was sort of, you know.

498
00:30:57,187 --> 00:30:58,586
It was right on the tip of my tongue.

499
00:30:58,747 --> 00:31:02,137
Mine too. It was just plain
"Something" I'm sure. I adored it.

500
00:31:02,307 --> 00:31:05,026
- And Bergman!
- She's the Virgo type!

501
00:31:05,187 --> 00:31:08,816
- Like all these, you know.
- Oh, I think she's lovely.

502
00:31:08,987 --> 00:31:12,866
I once went to the movies.
I saw Mary Pickford.

503
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:15,860
I was mad about her!
Didn't you love her?

504
00:31:16,027 --> 00:31:18,018
Well, the Virgo type, like all of these.

505
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:21,145
- What did you see her in?
- I don't quite recall.

506
00:31:21,307 --> 00:31:23,741
"The Something Something."

507
00:31:23,907 --> 00:31:27,741
Or was it just plain "Something"?
Something rather like that.

508
00:31:27,907 --> 00:31:30,467
I don't believe you ever went.

509
00:31:31,027 --> 00:31:36,579
If I were you, I'd go easy
on the pt, dear - calories.

510
00:31:36,747 --> 00:31:39,500
Phillip,
would you mind helping Mrs Atwater?

511
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:42,306
I'd be glad to. Sit down, Mrs Atwater.
I'll bring it to you.

512
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:44,025
Thank you so much, dear boy.

513
00:31:44,187 --> 00:31:46,860
I must apologise for David.
I can't think what's keeping him.

514
00:31:47,027 --> 00:31:49,063
He's only in town for the weekend
and David is very popular.

515
00:31:51,547 --> 00:31:55,460
- Here, let me help. White or dark?
- A little of both on this for Mrs Atwater.

516
00:31:55,627 --> 00:31:58,460
- What about you?
- I don't eat it.

517
00:31:58,627 --> 00:32:01,061
How queer! I never heard of anyone
who didn't eat chicken.

518
00:32:01,227 --> 00:32:04,299
Did you, Brandon? Oh, you probably did.

519
00:32:04,467 --> 00:32:07,345
- Why don't you eat it, Phillip?
- I just don't.

520
00:32:07,507 --> 00:32:08,576
There must be a reason.

521
00:32:08,747 --> 00:32:12,023
Freud says there's a reason
for everything, even me.

522
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:14,382
There's no reason, Janet.

523
00:32:14,547 --> 00:32:16,822
As I remember,
you have a very funny reason.

524
00:32:16,987 --> 00:32:18,261
- Doesn't he, Brandon?
- Yes.

525
00:32:18,427 --> 00:32:21,419
- I knew there had to be one. What is it?
- It's nothing too much.

526
00:32:21,587 --> 00:32:24,101
(Rupert) - It's fascinating.
(Janet) - Come on, Brandon, please.

527
00:32:24,267 --> 00:32:27,543
Well, it happened about
three years ago in Connecticut.

528
00:32:27,707 --> 00:32:29,982
Mother has a place there, you know.

529
00:32:30,147 --> 00:32:33,822
We were going to have chicken
so we walked over to the farm.

530
00:32:33,987 --> 00:32:36,660
It was a lovely
Sunday morning in late Spring.

531
00:32:36,827 --> 00:32:39,660
Across the valley,
the church bells were ringing.

532
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:43,661
In the yard, Phillip was doing likewise
to the necks of two or three chickens.

533
00:32:43,827 --> 00:32:44,862
Oh, dear!

534
00:32:45,027 --> 00:32:47,700
It was a task he usually
performed very competently.

535
00:32:47,867 --> 00:32:52,065
But on this particular morning, his touch
was, perhaps, a trifle too delicate.

536
00:32:52,227 --> 00:32:55,299
because one of the subjects
for our dinner table suddenly rebelled.

537
00:32:55,467 --> 00:32:57,617
- Like Lazarus, he rose -
- That's a lie!

538
00:33:00,707 --> 00:33:02,299
(Phillip) That's not true.

539
00:33:02,467 --> 00:33:04,423
I never strangled a chicken in my life!
(Brandon) - Now look here, Phillip -

540
00:33:04,587 --> 00:33:07,101
(Phillip) I never strangled a chicken,
and you know it.

541
00:33:07,267 --> 00:33:10,782
(Janet Laughing) Forgive me,
but it just seemed very funny,

542
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:14,257
you two being so intense
about an old, dead chicken.

543
00:33:14,427 --> 00:33:17,385
(Brandon) Sorry.
We were ridiculous and very rude.

544
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:20,266
I apologise for both of us and the story.

545
00:33:20,427 --> 00:33:22,418
Well!

546
00:33:23,827 --> 00:33:26,341
- Is it all over?
- I'm afraid so, Rupert.

547
00:33:26,507 --> 00:33:28,020
Oh, what a pity.

548
00:33:28,187 --> 00:33:31,702
In a moment, you might have strangled
each other instead of a chicken.

549
00:33:31,867 --> 00:33:35,462
(Atwater) - Mr Cadell, really.
- But a man's honour was at stake.

550
00:33:35,627 --> 00:33:38,824
And personally, I think a chicken
is as good a reason for murder

551
00:33:38,987 --> 00:33:41,979
as a blonde, a mattress full of dollar bills,

552
00:33:42,147 --> 00:33:46,186
or any of the customary,
unimaginative reasons.

553
00:33:46,347 --> 00:33:49,703
Now, you don't really approve
of murder, Rupert, if I may.

554
00:33:49,867 --> 00:33:52,825
You may, and I do.
Think of the problems it would solve -

555
00:33:52,987 --> 00:33:57,822
unemployment, poverty,
standing in line for theatre tickets.

556
00:33:57,987 --> 00:34:00,501
I must say,
I've had a perfectly dreadful time

557
00:34:00,667 --> 00:34:03,704
getting tickets for that new musical,
what's it called?

558
00:34:03,867 --> 00:34:06,825
- You know.
- "Something" with what's-her-name?

559
00:34:06,987 --> 00:34:10,821
My dear Mrs Atwater,
careful application of the trigger finger

560
00:34:10,987 --> 00:34:13,945
and a pair of seats in the first row
is yours for the shooting.

561
00:34:14,107 --> 00:34:17,577
And have you had any difficulty getting
into our velvet rope restaurants?

562
00:34:17,747 --> 00:34:20,102
- Frightful!
- A very simple matter.

563
00:34:20,267 --> 00:34:22,258
A flick of the knife, madam,

564
00:34:22,427 --> 00:34:24,463
and if you'll kindly step this way -

565
00:34:24,627 --> 00:34:28,176
Oh, no, step over the head waiter's body.

566
00:34:28,347 --> 00:34:29,780
Thank you, and here's your table.

567
00:34:29,947 --> 00:34:32,336
(Janet laughing)
Rupert, you're the end.

568
00:34:32,507 --> 00:34:34,657
(Kenneth) There's a hotel clerk
I could cheerfully flick a knife at.

569
00:34:34,827 --> 00:34:38,866
Oh, no, sorry. Knives may not
be used on hotel employees.

570
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:43,339
They are in the
"death by slow torture" category,

571
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:47,386
along with bird lovers,
small children and tap-dancers.

572
00:34:47,547 --> 00:34:50,857
Landlords, of course, are another matter.
You seeking an apartment?

573
00:34:51,027 --> 00:34:53,257
Call on our Miss Sash Weight

574
00:34:53,427 --> 00:34:55,338
of the blunt instrument department.

575
00:34:55,507 --> 00:34:57,941
What a divine idea!

576
00:34:58,107 --> 00:35:01,179
If it suits your purpose, merely...

577
00:35:01,467 --> 00:35:05,016
- But we'd all be murdering each other.
- Oh no. Oh no.

578
00:35:05,187 --> 00:35:09,624
After all, murder is, or should be, an art.

579
00:35:09,787 --> 00:35:12,904
Not one of the seven lively, perhaps,
but an art, nevertheless.

580
00:35:13,067 --> 00:35:17,424
As such, the privilege of
committing it should be reserved

581
00:35:17,587 --> 00:35:20,897
for those few who
are really superior individuals.

582
00:35:21,067 --> 00:35:24,582
And the victims - inferior beings
whose lives are unimportant anyway.

583
00:35:24,747 --> 00:35:25,862
(Rupert) Obviously.

584
00:35:26,027 --> 00:35:28,097
Now mind you,
I don't hold with the extremists

585
00:35:28,267 --> 00:35:30,986
who feel there should be open season
for murder all year round.

586
00:35:31,147 --> 00:35:34,617
No, personally, I would prefer to have...

587
00:35:34,787 --> 00:35:36,857
"Cut a Throat Week."

588
00:35:37,027 --> 00:35:39,939
Or "Strangulation Day."

589
00:35:41,027 --> 00:35:42,619
Probably a symptom
of approaching senility,

590
00:35:42,787 --> 00:35:47,224
but I must confess I really don't
appreciate this morbid humour.

591
00:35:47,387 --> 00:35:50,777
- The humour was unintentional.
- You're not serious about these theories.

592
00:35:50,947 --> 00:35:52,824
(Brandon) - Of course he is.
- You're both pulling my leg.

593
00:35:52,987 --> 00:35:54,386
No. Why do you think that?

594
00:35:54,547 --> 00:35:59,462
The notion that murder is an art
which superior beings should practice -

595
00:35:59,627 --> 00:36:01,538
(Rupert) ln season!

596
00:36:01,707 --> 00:36:05,495
- Now I know you're not serious.
(Rupert) - I'm a very serious fellow.

597
00:36:05,667 --> 00:36:08,579
Then may I ask who is to decide
if a human being is inferior,

598
00:36:08,747 --> 00:36:10,624
and is therefore
a suitable victim for murder?

599
00:36:10,787 --> 00:36:15,542
- The privileged few who commit it.
- And just who might they be?

600
00:36:15,707 --> 00:36:18,699
Oh, myself, Phillip...

601
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:21,264
possibly Rupert.

602
00:36:21,427 --> 00:36:23,543
(Rupert) I'm sorry, Kenneth, you're out.

603
00:36:23,707 --> 00:36:25,982
- Gentlemen, I'm serious.
- And so are we, Mr Kentley.

604
00:36:26,147 --> 00:36:29,298
The few are those men of such
intellectual and cultural superiority

605
00:36:29,467 --> 00:36:32,698
that they're above
the traditional moral concepts.

606
00:36:32,867 --> 00:36:36,064
Good and evil, right and wrong were
invented for the ordinary average man,

607
00:36:36,227 --> 00:36:37,660
the inferior man, because he needs them.

608
00:36:37,827 --> 00:36:39,818
So you agree with Nietzsche
and his theory of the superman.

609
00:36:39,987 --> 00:36:41,705
- Yes, I do.
- So did Hitler.

610
00:36:41,867 --> 00:36:43,778
Hitler was a paranoid savage.

611
00:36:43,947 --> 00:36:46,984
His supermen, all fascist supermen
were brainless murderers.

612
00:36:47,147 --> 00:36:48,546
I'd hang any who were left.

613
00:36:48,707 --> 00:36:52,222
But then, you see,
I'd hang them first for being stupid.

614
00:36:52,387 --> 00:36:55,823
I'd hang all incompetents and fools.
There are far too many in the world.

615
00:36:55,987 --> 00:37:00,424
Then hang me. I must be stupid, because
I don't know if you're serious or not.

616
00:37:00,587 --> 00:37:02,976
In any case,
I'd rather not hear any more of your,

617
00:37:03,147 --> 00:37:05,502
forgive me, contempt, for humanity,

618
00:37:05,667 --> 00:37:07,976
and for the standards of a world
that I believe is civilised.

619
00:37:08,147 --> 00:37:09,262
- Civilised?
- Yes.

620
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:11,497
Perhaps what is called
"Civilisation" is hypocrisy.

621
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:16,138
Well, I'm sure Rupert, fortunately,
has the intelligence and imagination -

622
00:37:16,307 --> 00:37:21,825
(Kentley) Please, Brandon,
we've had had just about enough.

623
00:37:21,987 --> 00:37:25,059
Phillip, where did you put those books
you set out for Mr Kentley?

624
00:37:25,227 --> 00:37:28,981
- I'd like to see them myself, if I may.
(Phillip) - They're in the dining room.

625
00:37:29,147 --> 00:37:31,502
Mr Kentley, wouldn't you
like to see the books now?

626
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,737
I apologise, sir.

627
00:37:33,907 --> 00:37:36,546
Again, I'm afraid
I let myself get carried away.

628
00:37:36,707 --> 00:37:39,221
Oh, that's quite alright, my boy.

629
00:37:39,387 --> 00:37:42,106
I think it's a good collection,
the first editions, I mean.

630
00:37:42,267 --> 00:37:45,020
Yes, I'd like to see them.
May I use the telephone first?

631
00:37:45,187 --> 00:37:48,020
I'd like to talk to my wife.
She may have some word of David.

632
00:37:48,187 --> 00:37:51,304
(Phillip) - Of course, it's this way.
(Atwater) - Oh, dear, oh, dear -

633
00:37:51,467 --> 00:37:54,777
- Uh, Brandon?
- Yes.

634
00:37:54,947 --> 00:37:57,905
You were pushing your point rather hard.

635
00:37:58,067 --> 00:38:01,537
You aren't planning to do away with
a few inferiors, by any chance?

636
00:38:01,707 --> 00:38:05,495
- I'm a creature of whim. Who knows?
- I see.

637
00:38:05,667 --> 00:38:07,498
(Janet)
I think he's definitely Scorpio.

638
00:38:07,667 --> 00:38:10,864
Uh, Mrs Atwater,
wouldn't you like to see the books?

639
00:38:11,027 --> 00:38:12,779
Oh, I'd love it.

640
00:38:12,947 --> 00:38:16,019
Do you know, when I was a girl,
I used to read quite a bit.

641
00:38:16,187 --> 00:38:19,338
Oh, we all do strange things
in our childhood.

642
00:38:21,827 --> 00:38:25,661
Kenneth, why don't you switch on
the radio or play some records.

643
00:38:25,827 --> 00:38:29,217
Atmospheric music goes a long way.

644
00:38:31,267 --> 00:38:34,225
He is such a sly, little devil, isn't he?

645
00:38:34,387 --> 00:38:37,424
(Record) Bringing us back together
with sweet music.

646
00:38:37,587 --> 00:38:40,545
Don't let it get you.
He's always doing something like this.

647
00:38:40,707 --> 00:38:42,777
- I'm going in the other room.
- To see the books?

648
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,142
No, to let Brandon see me.

649
00:38:45,307 --> 00:38:47,946
- Do you care what he thinks?
- I know what he thinks.

650
00:38:48,107 --> 00:38:51,986
He thinks I threw you over because
David has a bigger bank account.

651
00:38:52,147 --> 00:38:53,978
Then, why do you go?

652
00:38:54,147 --> 00:38:55,466
Because...

653
00:38:57,107 --> 00:38:59,098
Because I'm embarrassed
at being here with you.

654
00:38:59,267 --> 00:39:01,144
Oh, Janet!

655
00:39:01,307 --> 00:39:02,820
Never thought I could be, did you?

656
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,625
Honestly?

657
00:39:04,787 --> 00:39:06,186
No.

658
00:39:06,347 --> 00:39:09,942
Well, I am and I don't like it one bit.

659
00:39:10,107 --> 00:39:13,019
I should think you'd have the decency
to be embarrassed yourself.

660
00:39:13,187 --> 00:39:15,496
- Why?
- Well...

661
00:39:15,667 --> 00:39:18,864
You threw me over, chum, remember?

662
00:39:19,027 --> 00:39:22,940
My, wouldn't friend Brandon
love to know that?

663
00:39:24,107 --> 00:39:27,258
- What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm just thinking.

664
00:39:27,427 --> 00:39:30,817
- What about?
- Female vanity.

665
00:39:31,987 --> 00:39:35,377
Well, I'm also embarrassed because...

666
00:39:35,547 --> 00:39:36,866
Go on.

667
00:39:37,027 --> 00:39:38,983
Well, you and David
used to be such good friends.

668
00:39:39,147 --> 00:39:41,661
You're not now and it's my fault.

669
00:39:41,827 --> 00:39:44,136
- I'm such an idiot girl.
- No, you're not.

670
00:39:44,307 --> 00:39:47,697
Then I'm certainly giving
a good imitation of one.

671
00:39:47,867 --> 00:39:51,223
Why must I try and be so smart
with everyone but David?

672
00:39:51,387 --> 00:39:54,663
Don't you kid with David too?

673
00:39:54,827 --> 00:39:58,263
I relax with David, thanks to you.

674
00:39:58,827 --> 00:40:00,818
- To me?
- Yes.

675
00:40:01,827 --> 00:40:05,502
That... That grim Sunday at Harvard,

676
00:40:06,067 --> 00:40:08,137
when you called it quits,

677
00:40:08,307 --> 00:40:10,867
David took me for a walk.

678
00:40:11,027 --> 00:40:13,416
My chin was about an inch
from the ground.

679
00:40:13,587 --> 00:40:16,306
I just couldn't be the gay girl.

680
00:40:16,467 --> 00:40:20,255
I just relaxed and let everything pour out.

681
00:40:21,427 --> 00:40:24,066
The real, real me stuff.

682
00:40:24,227 --> 00:40:28,106
Did you hear that phrase?
I hear myself saying things like that...

683
00:40:28,267 --> 00:40:29,302
Oh, where's David?

684
00:40:29,467 --> 00:40:32,664
You know, I'm not very smart.

685
00:40:33,827 --> 00:40:35,146
Why?

686
00:40:35,947 --> 00:40:38,745
I never realised you were...

687
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:43,027
(Sighs)
Brandon and his atmospheric music.

688
00:40:43,187 --> 00:40:45,826
You are in love with David, aren't you?

689
00:40:45,987 --> 00:40:47,306
Yes.

690
00:40:49,067 --> 00:40:51,183
- I don't get it.
- Get what?

691
00:40:51,347 --> 00:40:53,224
Brandon made a crack when I got here.

692
00:40:53,387 --> 00:40:56,345
He implied I'd have a chance with you
again because David's out of the running.

693
00:40:56,507 --> 00:40:59,897
Wait. You mean, before I got here
Brandon knew we had broken up?

694
00:41:00,067 --> 00:41:02,786
- He even knew about you and David.
- What?

695
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:05,586
Kenneth, he pretended to be completely
ignorant when I told him. He said -

696
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:06,736
What's going on here?

697
00:41:06,907 --> 00:41:10,297
I don't know,
but I'm going to find out once and for all!

698
00:41:11,267 --> 00:41:12,620
- Brandon?
- Yes?

699
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:14,664
- May I see you for a moment?
- Certainly.

700
00:41:14,827 --> 00:41:17,785
Why can't he keep his hands off people?

701
00:41:17,947 --> 00:41:19,938
Well?

702
00:41:20,547 --> 00:41:22,458
Just exactly what are you up to?

703
00:41:22,627 --> 00:41:25,778
- Up to getting you a coffee, if you like.
- Let's dispense with the charm!

704
00:41:25,947 --> 00:41:27,266
I'd like to know why you had gall

705
00:41:27,427 --> 00:41:30,225
to tell Kenneth he wouldn't have to
worry much longer about David and me.

706
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,139
I don't think that's precisely what I said.

707
00:41:32,307 --> 00:41:34,662
It's what you implied
and I want to know why.

708
00:41:34,827 --> 00:41:37,625
Some women are quite charming
when they're angry, Janet.

709
00:41:37,787 --> 00:41:39,061
Unfortunately, you're not.

710
00:41:39,227 --> 00:41:41,661
- Cut that out, Brandon.
- Well, chivalry rears its ugly head!

711
00:41:41,827 --> 00:41:44,341
- I don't believe David's coming.
- Wait and see.

712
00:41:44,507 --> 00:41:47,419
I don't have to. He's never this late.
He's never late at all.

713
00:41:47,587 --> 00:41:49,862
If something had come up,
he'd have phoned.

714
00:41:50,027 --> 00:41:52,825
I think you deliberately arranged it
so that he wouldn't come.

715
00:41:52,987 --> 00:41:54,215
How clever of me.

716
00:41:54,387 --> 00:41:57,220
I might have known you couldn't
just give a party for Mr Kentley.

717
00:41:57,387 --> 00:41:59,378
You'd have to add something
that appealed

718
00:41:59,547 --> 00:42:01,378
to your warped sense of humour.

719
00:42:01,547 --> 00:42:05,506
I hope you've enjoyed
yourself, Brandon. I haven't.

720
00:42:06,067 --> 00:42:07,386
(Janet) He's really impossible.

721
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,378
(Kenneth)
You shouldn't let him upset you.

722
00:42:09,547 --> 00:42:10,696
Something gone wrong, Brandon?

723
00:42:10,867 --> 00:42:14,826
No, Janet has a talent
for being bothersome at times.

724
00:42:14,987 --> 00:42:18,423
However, I suppose I'd better...

725
00:42:18,587 --> 00:42:22,341
Uh, what did you mean,
'something gone wrong'?

726
00:42:22,507 --> 00:42:26,659
You always plan your parties so well,
it's odd to have anything go wrong.

727
00:42:26,827 --> 00:42:29,466
She seems to be missing David.

728
00:42:30,427 --> 00:42:33,544
(Rupert) As a matter of fact,
I'm beginning to miss him myself.

729
00:42:33,707 --> 00:42:35,140
Aren't we all?

730
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:41,825
- Two desserts, Mr Cadell?
- One for you and one for me, my love.

731
00:42:41,987 --> 00:42:44,865
The others don't seem to be
in the mood for ice cream.

732
00:42:45,027 --> 00:42:47,746
No, well, they could
all do with a little cooling off.

733
00:42:47,907 --> 00:42:52,025
My, it's a peculiar party,
not that that surprises me.

734
00:42:52,387 --> 00:42:54,696
- Why not?
- I could have predicted it this morning.

735
00:42:54,867 --> 00:42:57,256
Both of them must have got up
out of the wrong side of the bed.

736
00:42:57,427 --> 00:42:58,906
They've been in a state all day!

737
00:42:59,067 --> 00:43:01,945
Mr Brandon says he's always
in a state when he gives a party.

738
00:43:02,107 --> 00:43:03,222
First time I've seen it.

739
00:43:03,387 --> 00:43:05,662
Usually, he lets me prepare
everything my own way.

740
00:43:05,827 --> 00:43:08,944
But, look at this,
the chicken's hardly been touched.

741
00:43:09,107 --> 00:43:11,496
- What was so different today?
- What wasn't?

742
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:15,137
Mr Brandon was in the maddest rush
for me to clean up and get the table set.

743
00:43:15,307 --> 00:43:17,343
And, oh, it looked so lovely!

744
00:43:17,507 --> 00:43:19,384
(Mrs Wilson) But when
I was whisking out to do shopping,

745
00:43:19,547 --> 00:43:22,903
he suddenly told me to take
the whole afternoon for it.

746
00:43:23,067 --> 00:43:26,298
The whole afternoon,
after that mad rush in the morning.

747
00:43:26,467 --> 00:43:29,743
- Did he say why?
- No, just a whim, I suppose.

748
00:43:29,907 --> 00:43:33,661
But when I came back, he and Mr Phillip
were going at it hammer and tongs.

749
00:43:33,827 --> 00:43:36,295
Oh. What about?

750
00:43:36,467 --> 00:43:40,426
Now, Mr Cadell, even if I did know,
do you think I'd tell?

751
00:43:40,587 --> 00:43:44,023
- Well, I hope so.
- Not me. I'm like the grave.

752
00:43:44,187 --> 00:43:46,826
Look at this mess!
Just makes double the work.

753
00:43:46,987 --> 00:43:48,705
After I have this cleaned off,

754
00:43:48,867 --> 00:43:52,223
I have to clear all those books off
the dining room table,

755
00:43:52,387 --> 00:43:54,423
bring them here,
put them back in the chest,

756
00:43:54,587 --> 00:43:56,498
which is where
they were in the first place.

757
00:43:56,667 --> 00:44:00,296
- Why did you serve from here, anyway?
- It wasn't my idea.

758
00:44:00,467 --> 00:44:04,699
I had everything laid out in the
dining room and it was just beautiful.

759
00:44:04,867 --> 00:44:07,745
(Whispering) On this thing,
it doesn't have... (Fade Out)

760
00:44:07,907 --> 00:44:11,536
(Undiscernable)

761
00:44:20,067 --> 00:44:23,855
Is she still harping on her table and
how awkward it is to serve from this?

762
00:44:24,027 --> 00:44:26,097
It's much more convenient, you know.

763
00:44:26,267 --> 00:44:28,906
Because this way, people don't have
to go all the way into the dining room

764
00:44:29,067 --> 00:44:30,864
to get food and come
all the way back to eat it.

765
00:44:31,027 --> 00:44:34,258
Seems to me they've gone in there
now for their dessert and coffee.

766
00:44:34,427 --> 00:44:39,103
Mrs Wilson, please serve the guests.
Don't lecture them.

767
00:44:41,547 --> 00:44:44,539
We did get up on the wrong side
of the bed, didn't we?

768
00:44:48,387 --> 00:44:51,379
(Piano)

769
00:44:58,707 --> 00:45:02,666
- I'm in quite an embarrassing position.
- How do you mean?

770
00:45:02,827 --> 00:45:06,024
I seem to be the only one
having a good time.

771
00:45:06,187 --> 00:45:08,178
You and Mrs Atwater.

772
00:45:11,627 --> 00:45:13,618
What's going on, Phillip?

773
00:45:13,787 --> 00:45:16,347
Would you mind turning that off?

774
00:45:16,507 --> 00:45:19,977
- Sorry.
- I don't like the light in my eyes.

775
00:45:24,067 --> 00:45:25,819
You know, Phillip,

776
00:45:26,387 --> 00:45:31,017
I get quite intrigued when people don't
answer questions and quite curious.

777
00:45:31,187 --> 00:45:34,418
- Did you ask me a question?
- Yes, Phillip, I asked you a question.

778
00:45:34,587 --> 00:45:38,057
(Sirens)

779
00:45:38,227 --> 00:45:41,139
Well, what was it?

780
00:45:41,307 --> 00:45:44,299
I asked you what is going on here.

781
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:49,222
- A party.
- Yes, but a rather peculiar party.

782
00:45:49,387 --> 00:45:51,025
What's it all about, Phillip?

783
00:45:51,187 --> 00:45:55,021
What's what all about? Stop playing
"Crime and Punishment", Rupert.

784
00:45:55,187 --> 00:45:56,540
If you want to know something
come out with it! Otherwise -

785
00:45:56,707 --> 00:45:59,062
Now, now, temper, temper.

786
00:45:59,227 --> 00:46:00,706
- Don't stop.
- I'd like a drink.

787
00:46:00,867 --> 00:46:03,859
Wait, I'll get it for you. Keep playing.
What would you like, Scotch?

788
00:46:04,027 --> 00:46:06,097
(Phillip) No, brandy.

789
00:46:06,267 --> 00:46:08,258
(Piano Continues)

790
00:46:10,627 --> 00:46:14,540
You're very fond
of that little tune, aren't you?

791
00:46:14,787 --> 00:46:18,382
You know, I wish I could come
straight out with what I want to know.

792
00:46:18,547 --> 00:46:21,459
Unfortunately, I don't know anything.

793
00:46:21,627 --> 00:46:23,618
I merely suspect.

794
00:46:25,787 --> 00:46:28,142
- I said that -
(Phillip) - I heard you.

795
00:46:28,307 --> 00:46:31,617
- This alright?
(Phillip) - Thank you.

796
00:46:32,547 --> 00:46:34,538
(Guests Laughing)

797
00:46:37,627 --> 00:46:40,141
- Do you use this?
- Sometimes.

798
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:42,741
I thought only beginners did.

799
00:46:42,907 --> 00:46:45,944
- I must say -
- Alright, Rupert, I'll ask you.

800
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:48,416
What do you suspect?

801
00:46:49,187 --> 00:46:52,896
Oh, I'd forgotten. Where's David, Phillip?

802
00:46:53,067 --> 00:46:55,501
I don't know. Why?

803
00:46:55,667 --> 00:46:56,941
- Brandon knows.
- Does he?

804
00:46:57,107 --> 00:46:58,222
- Doesn't he?
- Not that I know of.

805
00:46:58,387 --> 00:47:01,777
- Oh, come now.
- I don't. Why don't you ask Brandon?

806
00:47:01,947 --> 00:47:03,983
I have,

807
00:47:04,147 --> 00:47:08,425
but he's too busy manoeuvring
the other two points of the triangle.

808
00:47:08,587 --> 00:47:10,225
What for, Phillip?

809
00:47:10,387 --> 00:47:13,584
Just what is Brandon trying to do
with Janet and Kenneth?

810
00:47:13,747 --> 00:47:15,738
(Laughs)

811
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:19,146
- What are you laughing at?
- Nothing.

812
00:47:19,307 --> 00:47:22,982
What is it?
What, am I so far off the track?

813
00:47:23,387 --> 00:47:26,857
There's nothing going on at all, Rupert.

814
00:47:29,827 --> 00:47:31,499
You're, uh...

815
00:47:32,707 --> 00:47:35,779
more than usually allergic
to the truth tonight, Phillip.

816
00:47:35,947 --> 00:47:37,778
That's the second time
you haven't told it.

817
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:39,699
Thanks. When was the first?

818
00:47:39,867 --> 00:47:43,303
When you said that you'd
never strangled a chicken.

819
00:47:43,467 --> 00:47:44,695
You're confused.

820
00:47:44,867 --> 00:47:47,939
Brandon dreamt that up
for the sake of a very unfunny joke.

821
00:47:48,107 --> 00:47:51,497
No, he didn't. No, he didn't, Phillip.

822
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:56,821
And if you'll think back carefully,
you'll realise that I know he didn't.

823
00:47:58,547 --> 00:48:02,859
About a year ago,
I was up at the farm. Remember?

824
00:48:03,027 --> 00:48:07,066
One morning
I saw you display your handiwork.

825
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:10,617
You're quite a good chicken strangler,
as I recall.

826
00:48:10,787 --> 00:48:13,824
Well, l... I just meant
that Brandon's story wasn't true.

827
00:48:13,987 --> 00:48:16,103
- I didn't mean I hadn't killed chickens.
- That's what you said.

828
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:19,384
Well, I didn't think it was a suitable topic
of conversation while we were eating.

829
00:48:19,547 --> 00:48:21,299
- You could have said that.
- Alright, I didn't.

830
00:48:21,467 --> 00:48:24,027
We're not eating now, Phillip.
What did you lie to me for?

831
00:48:24,187 --> 00:48:26,382
- Because I don't like to talk about -
- About what? Strangling -

832
00:48:26,547 --> 00:48:29,425
- I can't play with that thing!
(Brandon) - I want you to have them.

833
00:48:29,587 --> 00:48:31,737
(Kentley) - It's extremely generous
of you, Brandon. I don't -

834
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:35,217
(Brandon) Please, I know you appreciate
first editions more than l, Mr Kentley.

835
00:48:35,387 --> 00:48:38,299
(Kentley) - It's very nice of you.
- What's wrong?

836
00:48:38,467 --> 00:48:41,140
(Kentley) - You must come to dinner...
- What's wrong now, Phillip?

837
00:48:41,307 --> 00:48:42,945
Don't you want
Mr Kentley to have the books?

838
00:48:43,107 --> 00:48:47,146
- No. I don't care if he has them, I just -
- What? What?

839
00:48:47,307 --> 00:48:49,821
I think it's a clumsy way
of tying them up, that's all.

840
00:48:49,987 --> 00:48:51,818
(Brandon) David's never had
trouble taking care of himself.

841
00:48:51,987 --> 00:48:53,705
(Mr Kentley)
I know but I cannot understand this.

842
00:48:53,867 --> 00:48:56,745
Whenever he's been detained before,
he's telephoned us. Isn't that so, Janet?

843
00:48:56,907 --> 00:48:59,341
(Janet) Oh yes. He's always
been after me to be more punctual.

844
00:48:59,507 --> 00:49:00,656
(Kenneth) And well he might.

845
00:49:00,827 --> 00:49:04,740
You wouldn't know me these days.
I'm a new woman, punctual as a clock.

846
00:49:04,907 --> 00:49:06,818
(Atwater)
That's very unfeminine, my dear.

847
00:49:06,987 --> 00:49:09,376
(Kentley) Perhaps,
but I prefer manners to femininity.

848
00:49:09,547 --> 00:49:11,538
(Atwater)
Oh Henry, you sound just like Daddy.

849
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:14,665
I remember once, when David
was still at home...(Fades Out)

850
00:49:14,827 --> 00:49:17,216
Take it easy, Phillip.

851
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:19,617
- Rupert's onto something.
- He isn't. Now, let up.

852
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:21,505
- I've got to have a drink.
- Enough.

853
00:49:21,667 --> 00:49:23,942
Take your hand off my arm!

854
00:49:24,107 --> 00:49:28,498
Don't you ever again tell me
what to do and what not to do.

855
00:49:28,667 --> 00:49:31,545
- I don't like it, and I'm not going -
- Keep your voice down.

856
00:49:31,707 --> 00:49:34,983
I, uh, hope I didn't upset Phillip.

857
00:49:35,747 --> 00:49:38,784
Uh, no, he's more likely mixing his drinks.

858
00:49:39,907 --> 00:49:42,899
- You seem rather upset yourself.
- Do l?

859
00:49:43,067 --> 00:49:45,706
Yes, there's something upsetting
both of you a great deal.

860
00:49:45,867 --> 00:49:47,619
- Something that -
(Wilson) - Excuse me, sir.

861
00:49:50,107 --> 00:49:52,667
There's a lady phoning
for either Mr Kentley or Mrs Atwater.

862
00:49:52,827 --> 00:49:56,024
- It must be Alice. I'll talk to her, Henry.
- (Kentley) Alright.

863
00:49:56,187 --> 00:49:57,939
Down the hall to your left, dear.

864
00:49:58,107 --> 00:49:59,620
- Thank you.
- The first bedroom.

865
00:49:59,787 --> 00:50:03,063
(Janet) Mr Kentley,
do you suppose David could be home?

866
00:50:03,227 --> 00:50:04,979
(Kentley) I don't know. I hope so.

867
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:06,819
(Rupert) I hate to throw a damper,

868
00:50:06,987 --> 00:50:10,377
but if David was home, I think he'd
be calling instead of Mrs Kentley.

869
00:50:10,547 --> 00:50:12,617
- Wouldn't you say so, Brandon?
(Brandon) - I wouldn't know.

870
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:15,779
(Rupert) The David I remember
was polite as well as punctual.

871
00:50:15,947 --> 00:50:17,460
(Janet) He hasn't changed.

872
00:50:17,627 --> 00:50:21,222
(Rupert) Of course,
if he's not home, where could he be?

873
00:50:21,387 --> 00:50:22,615
(Kenneth) Don't ask me. I don't know.

874
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,698
(Brandon)
He might be at any number of places.

875
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:28,257
(Rupert) - Such as?
(Brandon) - The club, or Bradley's party.

876
00:50:28,427 --> 00:50:31,021
- Maybe he went down to Janet's.
(Rupert) - Why?

877
00:50:31,187 --> 00:50:32,620
(Brandon) Perhaps he decided
to pick her up, after all.

878
00:50:32,787 --> 00:50:35,221
(Janet) I phoned my place
after I spoke to Mrs Kentley.

879
00:50:35,387 --> 00:50:38,185
(Kentley) - He wasn't there ?
(Janet) - No. I left a message in case.

880
00:50:38,347 --> 00:50:40,463
(Rupert) We might have a better chance
of finding out where he is now

881
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:43,744
if we knew where he was this
afternoon. What do you think, Brandon?

882
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:46,057
(Brandon) I haven't the least idea
where he was this afternoon.

883
00:50:46,227 --> 00:50:49,060
(Rupert) Don't you think It would help
if we found out where he was?

884
00:50:49,227 --> 00:50:50,501
(Brandon) I suppose so.

885
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:52,862
(Kentley) I know he went to the club
this afternoon to play tennis.

886
00:50:53,027 --> 00:50:54,824
- I know he got there.
(Rupert) - Why?

887
00:50:54,987 --> 00:50:58,536
(Kentley) Someone phoned with a
message that David would meet us here.

888
00:50:58,707 --> 00:51:01,426
(Rupert) - Do you know who?
(Kentley) - No.

889
00:51:01,587 --> 00:51:06,024
(Rupert) Obviously, David ran into
someone at the club and changed plans.

890
00:51:06,187 --> 00:51:08,143
You weren't there this afternoon,
were you, Kenneth?

891
00:51:08,307 --> 00:51:10,059
(Kenneth) No. I wish I had been.

892
00:51:10,227 --> 00:51:12,218
(Rupert) I don't suppose
you or Brandon were, Phillip ?

893
00:51:12,387 --> 00:51:13,376
(Phillip) No.

894
00:51:13,547 --> 00:51:15,856
(Brandon) Hardly, we had our hands
full getting ready for the party.

895
00:51:16,027 --> 00:51:18,018
(Rupert) Oh, there was a lot
to be done this afternoon?

896
00:51:18,187 --> 00:51:20,940
(Brandon) - You know.
(Rupert) - Yes, I see.

897
00:51:21,107 --> 00:51:24,179
You didn't speak to David at all today?

898
00:51:24,347 --> 00:51:26,417
(Brandon) No. Why do you ask?

899
00:51:26,587 --> 00:51:29,704
(Rupert) I thought he might have have
called to say he'd be late or something.

900
00:51:29,867 --> 00:51:30,504
(Brandon) He didn't.

901
00:51:30,667 --> 00:51:33,864
Neither Phillip nor I have talked to
David since we invited him to the party.

902
00:51:34,027 --> 00:51:36,302
(Kentley) - That's odd.
(Rupert) - What do you mean?

903
00:51:36,467 --> 00:51:40,221
(Kentley) I thought I heard David on the
phone to Phillip yesterday morning.

904
00:51:40,387 --> 00:51:42,821
(Phillip) Yes, you did. I'd forgotten.

905
00:51:42,987 --> 00:51:45,501
(Brandon) Oh? What were you talking
about? Did he call about the party?

906
00:51:45,667 --> 00:51:48,500
(Phillip) Yes, he wanted to make sure
about the time. That was all.

907
00:51:48,667 --> 00:51:50,862
Here, I'll help you with that.

908
00:51:51,027 --> 00:51:53,700
Oh, thank you, Mr Cadell.

909
00:51:53,867 --> 00:51:55,619
That's alright, Mrs Wilson.

910
00:51:55,787 --> 00:51:58,301
You can put the books back
when you come to clean in the morning.

911
00:51:58,467 --> 00:52:00,378
I didn't have any idea
of coming in in the morning.

912
00:52:00,547 --> 00:52:04,062
I'm afraid you'll have to.
Just let the books go for now.

913
00:52:04,227 --> 00:52:05,979
Well, alright.

914
00:52:08,067 --> 00:52:12,458
Henry, Alice hasn't had a word
from David. She's frantic.

915
00:52:12,627 --> 00:52:15,061
- I better talk to her.
- She hung up.

916
00:52:15,227 --> 00:52:18,617
She began to cry so badly.
Oh, Henry, I'm worried.

917
00:52:18,787 --> 00:52:19,856
What did she say?

918
00:52:20,027 --> 00:52:24,020
She's called every place he might be,
not once, but several times.

919
00:52:24,187 --> 00:52:27,816
And now, Henry, she thinks
he may have had an accident.

920
00:52:27,987 --> 00:52:30,626
- She wants you to call the police.
(Janet) - The police?

921
00:52:30,787 --> 00:52:34,621
(Kentley) Oh, no, Anita,
I don't think that's necessary.

922
00:52:34,787 --> 00:52:37,176
David's no longer a child.

923
00:52:37,347 --> 00:52:40,703
I'm quite sure he's alright. I -

924
00:52:40,867 --> 00:52:44,303
Brandon, I think I'd better go home.
My wife needs me.

925
00:52:44,467 --> 00:52:48,096
- This isn't like David. He -
- No, of course, I understand.

926
00:52:48,267 --> 00:52:51,020
- May I go with you, Mr Kentley?
- Thank you, Janet.

927
00:52:51,187 --> 00:52:52,666
- I'll get your things.
- Thank you.

928
00:52:52,827 --> 00:52:57,343
- Oh, Mr Kentley, your books.
- Oh! Oh, yes.

929
00:52:57,507 --> 00:53:00,021
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

930
00:53:00,187 --> 00:53:02,382
Would you call me as soon
as you hear from David?

931
00:53:02,547 --> 00:53:06,256
(Atwater) I'm sure the dear
boy will turn up somehow.

932
00:53:06,427 --> 00:53:08,224
- Janet?
- Yes?

933
00:53:08,387 --> 00:53:12,016
This is hardly the time,
but I'm very glad we had that talk.

934
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:14,985
So am l, and David will be too.

935
00:53:15,147 --> 00:53:16,341
Good.

936
00:53:16,507 --> 00:53:19,499
- Well -
- Kenneth, why don't you come with us?

937
00:53:19,667 --> 00:53:22,340
- Oh, I don't -
- Please.

938
00:53:22,507 --> 00:53:24,577
- Thanks.
- This yours, Janet?

939
00:53:24,747 --> 00:53:28,535
Yes, I'll just carry it. Oh, thanks.

940
00:53:28,707 --> 00:53:30,823
- I'll get my hat.
- Oh, going with Janet?

941
00:53:30,987 --> 00:53:35,344
- Yes, we're all going together.
- What did I predict?

942
00:53:37,907 --> 00:53:41,695
(Brandon) Good night, Mr Kentley.
I hope Mrs Kentley feels better soon.

943
00:53:41,867 --> 00:53:43,220
(Kentley) Thank you.

944
00:53:43,387 --> 00:53:45,105
(Brandon) You will call me
the moment you hear from David?

945
00:53:45,267 --> 00:53:47,383
(Kentley)
I will. Say good night to Phillip for us.

946
00:53:47,547 --> 00:53:50,505
(Brandon) Mrs Atwater,
thank you so much for coming.

947
00:53:50,667 --> 00:53:52,862
(Atwater)
Thank you for letting me come.

948
00:53:53,027 --> 00:53:55,541
I'm so sorry we have to leave. Bye.

949
00:53:55,707 --> 00:53:57,299
(Brandon) Good night.

950
00:53:57,467 --> 00:54:01,619
(Laughs) - Oh, that's not yours.
- Oh. Oh.

951
00:54:01,787 --> 00:54:03,140
(Kentley)
I'm very sorry we had to spoil it.

952
00:54:03,307 --> 00:54:05,104
(Brandon) You couldn't possibly
spoil it, Mr Kentley.

953
00:54:05,267 --> 00:54:07,576
(Kentley) I meant by leaving so early.

954
00:54:07,747 --> 00:54:11,137
Good night.
Be careful of those stairs, Anita.

955
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:13,946
- Thank you, Mrs Wilson.
- Good night, Mr Cadell.

956
00:54:14,107 --> 00:54:17,383
- Oh, you going too?
- Yes, I must. Good night.

957
00:54:17,547 --> 00:54:18,616
Good night.

958
00:54:18,787 --> 00:54:22,939
(Rupert) May I help you
with those books, Mr Kentley?

959
00:54:44,707 --> 00:54:49,098
Thank you for a lovely evening.
Good night. It's been charming.

960
00:54:49,267 --> 00:54:50,620
(Laughing)

961
00:54:50,787 --> 00:54:54,826
Oh, Phillip, this party really
deserves to go down in history.

962
00:54:54,987 --> 00:54:58,343
Well, come on, it's over, and it
couldn't have gone more beautifully.

963
00:54:58,507 --> 00:55:00,782
Yes, it could, without Rupert.

964
00:55:00,947 --> 00:55:04,303
But he was brilliant. He helped me
say all I wanted to say to those idiots.

965
00:55:04,467 --> 00:55:06,662
He gave the party
the very touch I predicted.

966
00:55:06,827 --> 00:55:08,385
The touch of what?

967
00:55:08,547 --> 00:55:12,301
Prying, snooping, or just plain pumping?

968
00:55:12,947 --> 00:55:14,778
Do you know how busy
he was questioning me?

969
00:55:14,947 --> 00:55:17,859
- About what?
- Oh, what difference.

970
00:55:18,027 --> 00:55:20,985
You were busy in there arranging
that other little touch of yours.

971
00:55:21,147 --> 00:55:24,105
- What touch?
- Tying up the books that way.

972
00:55:24,267 --> 00:55:26,542
Oh, I thought that was wonderful.
Didn't you like it?

973
00:55:26,707 --> 00:55:29,096
No, Brandon, I didn't like it one bit.

974
00:55:29,267 --> 00:55:31,064
You'll ruin everything
with your neat little touches.

975
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:34,344
Be quiet. Mrs Wilson's still here.

976
00:55:35,507 --> 00:55:40,103
- Determined to get drunk, aren't you?
- I am drunk.

977
00:55:40,267 --> 00:55:43,418
And just as childish as you were before
when you called me a liar.

978
00:55:43,587 --> 00:55:46,340
- You had no business telling that story.
- Why did you lie, anyway?

979
00:55:46,507 --> 00:55:47,781
I had to.

980
00:55:47,947 --> 00:55:49,858
Have you ever bothered for one minute

981
00:55:50,027 --> 00:55:51,824
to understand how
someone else might feel?

982
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:53,659
I'm not sentimental,
if that's what you mean.

983
00:55:53,827 --> 00:55:55,340
That's not what I mean,
but it doesn't matter.

984
00:55:55,507 --> 00:55:59,261
Nothing matters,
except that Mr Brandon liked the party.

985
00:55:59,427 --> 00:56:01,224
Mr Brandon gave the party.

986
00:56:01,387 --> 00:56:03,947
Mr Brandon had a delightful evening.

987
00:56:04,107 --> 00:56:06,826
Well, I had a rotten evening.

988
00:56:06,987 --> 00:56:09,455
Keep drinking
and you'll have a worse morning.

989
00:56:09,627 --> 00:56:13,415
At least if I have a hangover,
it will be all mine.

990
00:56:15,547 --> 00:56:17,503
Y-You know, Phillip, I've been thinking.

991
00:56:17,667 --> 00:56:20,056
We deserve a real holiday
after it's all over.

992
00:56:20,227 --> 00:56:21,979
Where would you like to go?

993
00:56:22,147 --> 00:56:24,138
Of course, we should come back here
for a few days, first.

994
00:56:24,307 --> 00:56:25,786
Otherwise, it might look -

995
00:56:25,947 --> 00:56:29,337
I've been praying I'd wake up
and find we hadn't done it yet.

996
00:56:29,507 --> 00:56:31,304
But why?

997
00:56:33,547 --> 00:56:37,335
I'm scared to death, Brandon.
I think we're going to get caught.

998
00:56:37,507 --> 00:56:40,863
Oh, there's not a chance.
Well, there was, but not any more.

999
00:56:41,027 --> 00:56:43,780
Why, we're pra - (Door Opening)

1000
00:56:43,947 --> 00:56:45,903
Uh. Is that you, Mrs Wilson?

1001
00:56:46,067 --> 00:56:49,298
Yes. I'll need a key to get in
and clean up in the morning.

1002
00:56:49,467 --> 00:56:51,856
That is if you're still
driving up to the farm tonight.

1003
00:56:52,027 --> 00:56:54,621
- Oh, we're driving up, alright.
- Oh, that's good.

1004
00:56:54,787 --> 00:56:57,506
You don't look too well,
either one of you. Oh, thanks.

1005
00:56:57,667 --> 00:56:59,464
Of course, I could do with a rest myself,

1006
00:56:59,627 --> 00:57:02,699
but I want both of you
to come back in tip-top shape.

1007
00:57:02,867 --> 00:57:05,335
- We will.
- Well, I'm off. Enjoy yourselves.

1008
00:57:05,507 --> 00:57:07,816
Don't forget to write.

1009
00:57:07,987 --> 00:57:11,184
And mind your P's and Q's.

1010
00:57:16,387 --> 00:57:17,706
Who are you calling?

1011
00:57:18,307 --> 00:57:20,025
Only the garage.

1012
00:57:20,987 --> 00:57:24,980
Hello? This is Mr Brandon Shaw.
Would you send my car around, please?

1013
00:57:25,147 --> 00:57:27,502
Yes, right away. Thank you.

1014
00:57:46,987 --> 00:57:50,423
We'd... better draw the curtains.

1015
00:57:53,427 --> 00:57:56,464
(Phone Ringing) Who's that?

1016
00:57:57,627 --> 00:58:00,221
- Brandon, who's that?
- Probably the garage man. Answer it.

1017
00:58:00,387 --> 00:58:01,979
There hasn't been time
for him to get here.

1018
00:58:02,147 --> 00:58:04,342
Then maybe Mrs Wilson
forgot something. Answer it.

1019
00:58:04,507 --> 00:58:07,385
Brandon... Brandon,
couldn't we pretend we're not home?

1020
00:58:07,547 --> 00:58:10,425
With all these lights on?
Answer it, Phillip.

1021
00:58:11,187 --> 00:58:13,178
(Phone Ringing)

1022
00:58:19,027 --> 00:58:21,018
(Ringing Continues)

1023
00:58:25,947 --> 00:58:27,938
Who is it?

1024
00:58:32,147 --> 00:58:34,661
- Brandon. Brandon, it's Rupert.
- What?

1025
00:58:34,827 --> 00:58:38,058
He wants to come up.
He says he left his cigarette case here.

1026
00:58:38,227 --> 00:58:42,061
- Well, let him come.
- You know he's lying! He's caught on.

1027
00:58:42,227 --> 00:58:44,661
- Shut up and get back to that phone.
- I won't.

1028
00:58:44,827 --> 00:58:46,818
- Get back to that phone.
- Brandon, I can't.

1029
00:58:46,987 --> 00:58:48,466
- You've got to.
- No! He knows -

1030
00:58:48,627 --> 00:58:50,618
Shut up!

1031
00:59:04,747 --> 00:59:07,739
Rupert? Come on up.

1032
00:59:09,267 --> 00:59:12,179
No, uh, course not.

1033
00:59:12,347 --> 00:59:14,542
He's just a little tight.

1034
00:59:16,507 --> 00:59:19,385
No, but we'll find it in no time.

1035
00:59:21,067 --> 00:59:22,466
Right.

1036
00:59:31,067 --> 00:59:33,661
Phillip... Phillip, listen to me.

1037
00:59:33,827 --> 00:59:37,263
Rupert's on his way up now,
and you've got to pull yourself together.

1038
00:59:37,427 --> 00:59:39,258
Phillip, did you hear me?

1039
00:59:40,427 --> 00:59:42,418
Come on, have another drink if you must,

1040
00:59:42,587 --> 00:59:46,296
but get hold of yourself
and keep your mouth shut.

1041
00:59:46,467 --> 00:59:49,618
It'll be over in five minutes.

1042
00:59:49,787 --> 00:59:52,585
I don't know how much,
if anything, Rupert knows,

1043
00:59:52,747 --> 00:59:58,538
but I promise you he'll be out of here
in five minutes, one way or the other.

1044
00:59:58,707 --> 01:00:02,859
Phillip, for those five minutes,
you've got to pull yourself together.

1045
01:00:03,027 --> 01:00:05,780
- Brandon, Brandon -
- Now look.

1046
01:00:05,947 --> 01:00:10,463
I'm not going to get caught
because of you or anyone else.

1047
01:00:10,627 --> 01:00:13,425
No one is going to get in my way now.

1048
01:00:29,387 --> 01:00:31,378
(Door Buzzer)

1049
01:00:38,387 --> 01:00:41,379
Brandon, it's not loaded, is it?

1050
01:00:44,947 --> 01:00:46,380
(Door Buzzer)

1051
01:00:48,067 --> 01:00:50,581
(Rupert) - Sorry to bother you, Brandon.
(Brandon) - It's no bother. Come in.

1052
01:00:50,747 --> 01:00:54,899
I knew you were leaving tonight.
I didn't want to be left without my case.

1053
01:00:55,067 --> 01:00:56,386
- Hello, Phillip.
- Hello.

1054
01:00:56,547 --> 01:00:58,185
I didn't mean to alarm you before.

1055
01:00:58,347 --> 01:01:01,817
You didn't alarm him. I'm afraid
Phillip's a little antisocial tonight.

1056
01:01:01,987 --> 01:01:05,741
- Oh? I thought perhaps -
- Any idea where you left the case?

1057
01:01:05,907 --> 01:01:07,898
No. No, not at all.

1058
01:01:09,347 --> 01:01:11,497
Completely unlike me to forget it, isn't it?

1059
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:15,740
I suppose a psychoanalyst would say
that I didn't really forget it at all.

1060
01:01:15,907 --> 01:01:20,264
I unconsciously left it
because I wanted to come back.

1061
01:01:21,227 --> 01:01:23,218
But, uh...

1062
01:01:23,987 --> 01:01:27,184
- Why should I want to come back?
- Yes, why?

1063
01:01:27,347 --> 01:01:29,941
For the pleasure of our company
or another drink.

1064
01:01:30,107 --> 01:01:32,018
That's a good idea.
May I have one for the road?

1065
01:01:32,187 --> 01:01:33,905
Of course. A short one?

1066
01:01:34,067 --> 01:01:36,297
No, I'd prefer a long one,
if you don't mind.

1067
01:01:36,467 --> 01:01:39,027
Not at all.
Phillip, will you fix Rupert a drink?

1068
01:01:39,187 --> 01:01:43,419
Now let me see,
the last I remember having the case

1069
01:01:45,387 --> 01:01:47,378
was when I was there.

1070
01:01:49,347 --> 01:01:54,341
I was just going to open the chest
for Mrs Wilson, when you came over.

1071
01:01:54,707 --> 01:01:56,698
And then what?

1072
01:02:00,747 --> 01:02:02,738
I think l, uh -

1073
01:02:05,707 --> 01:02:08,141
Wonder where it could be.

1074
01:02:08,307 --> 01:02:11,185
Oh, well, here it is, right where I left it.

1075
01:02:11,347 --> 01:02:14,305
Gentlemen, I beg your pardon.
I'm very sorry.

1076
01:02:14,467 --> 01:02:16,742
I, uh -

1077
01:02:16,907 --> 01:02:18,863
Well, may I have that drink anyway?

1078
01:02:19,027 --> 01:02:20,506
Of course.

1079
01:02:20,667 --> 01:02:23,135
- You really don't mind?
- No. Why should we?

1080
01:02:23,307 --> 01:02:25,263
- Well, you might be -
- What?

1081
01:02:25,427 --> 01:02:29,261
- Tired. You're sure it's alright?
- He said you could have it!

1082
01:02:29,427 --> 01:02:30,780
- Thank you.
- Don't mind Phillip.

1083
01:02:30,947 --> 01:02:35,577
- I'm afraid he's had a few too many.
- Well, why not? Why not?

1084
01:02:35,747 --> 01:02:38,739
After all, it was a party.

1085
01:02:41,707 --> 01:02:46,098
Well, it's very pleasant to sit here
with a good drink and good company.

1086
01:02:46,267 --> 01:02:48,258
I'm glad.

1087
01:02:51,027 --> 01:02:53,587
- Please don't let me be in the way.
- Of what?

1088
01:02:53,747 --> 01:02:56,420
- I know you have things to do.
- What do you mean?

1089
01:02:56,587 --> 01:02:58,339
Packing, last-minute odds and ends.

1090
01:02:58,507 --> 01:03:00,418
You are driving
to Connecticut tonight, aren't you?

1091
01:03:00,587 --> 01:03:04,375
- Yes, but we're all packed.
- Oh, I see. All ready.

1092
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:09,057
All except one guest,
who must be gotten rid of.

1093
01:03:09,227 --> 01:03:11,457
Well, I'll be off as... uh...

1094
01:03:11,627 --> 01:03:14,061
as soon as I finish my drink.

1095
01:03:15,067 --> 01:03:17,786
There's no need to hurry, Rupert.

1096
01:03:17,947 --> 01:03:21,303
Thank you.
I, uh... would like to stay a bit.

1097
01:03:22,467 --> 01:03:24,856
Perhaps even see you off.

1098
01:03:25,827 --> 01:03:28,625
I always hate to leave a party,

1099
01:03:29,907 --> 01:03:35,027
especially when the evening
has been unusually stimulating,

1100
01:03:35,187 --> 01:03:37,985
or strange, like this evening.

1101
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:40,976
What do you mean, 'strange'?

1102
01:03:43,467 --> 01:03:44,946
Did I say 'strange,' Brandon?

1103
01:03:45,107 --> 01:03:48,736
You often pick words for sound
rather than meaning.

1104
01:03:48,907 --> 01:03:52,456
I don't exactly know what I meant,

1105
01:03:52,627 --> 01:03:56,176
unless I was thinking about David.

1106
01:03:58,067 --> 01:04:01,742
- What was strange about David?
- His not showing up.

1107
01:04:01,907 --> 01:04:04,785
You don't think anything
really did happen to him, do you?

1108
01:04:04,947 --> 01:04:08,223
- What could have?
- He could have been run over or held up.

1109
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:12,858
- In broad daylight?
- That's right, I'd forgotten.

1110
01:04:13,027 --> 01:04:17,020
Yes, it must have been broad
daylight when it happened.

1111
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:20,384
When, uh... what happened?

1112
01:04:22,547 --> 01:04:25,345
When whatever did happen to David.

1113
01:04:26,307 --> 01:04:28,298
Nothing, probably.

1114
01:04:32,107 --> 01:04:35,895
Still... where is he?

1115
01:04:36,067 --> 01:04:39,059
- What's your theory?
- Mine?

1116
01:04:39,227 --> 01:04:41,024
I was considering
Janet's for the moment.

1117
01:04:41,187 --> 01:04:44,384
- Oh? I didn't know she had one.
- Yes, you do.

1118
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:47,619
I couldn't help overhearing Janet.

1119
01:04:47,787 --> 01:04:51,336
She thinks you kidnapped David, or did
something to prevent him from coming.

1120
01:04:51,507 --> 01:04:55,295
I'm not interested in Janet's prattle,
but you always interest me, Rupert.

1121
01:04:55,467 --> 01:04:58,539
Do you think l, uh... 'kidnapped' David?

1122
01:04:58,707 --> 01:05:01,779
It's the sort of mischief that would
have appealed to you in school,

1123
01:05:01,947 --> 01:05:04,939
for the experience,
the excitement, the danger.

1124
01:05:05,107 --> 01:05:09,942
But it would be slightly more difficult
to pull off now, though, don't you think?

1125
01:05:10,107 --> 01:05:12,018
- Ah, you'd find a way.
- How?

1126
01:05:12,187 --> 01:05:14,576
I mean, suppose you were l.

1127
01:05:15,507 --> 01:05:18,101
How would you
get David out of the way?

1128
01:05:18,267 --> 01:05:19,859
You're much better
at this sort of thing than I am.

1129
01:05:20,027 --> 01:05:23,099
What would you do if you were l?

1130
01:05:25,667 --> 01:05:30,297
Well... if I wanted to get rid of David,

1131
01:05:30,467 --> 01:05:34,779
I'd invite him for a drink
at the club or some quiet bar.

1132
01:05:34,947 --> 01:05:36,903
or better still, I'd invite him here.

1133
01:05:37,067 --> 01:05:40,139
- Then no one would see us together.
- That's good. And no witnesses?

1134
01:05:40,307 --> 01:05:42,775
- Yes, that's right.
- Then what?

1135
01:05:45,507 --> 01:05:47,498
Well...

1136
01:05:49,867 --> 01:05:51,858
Well, let me see.

1137
01:05:53,427 --> 01:05:56,339
(Rupert)
At the right time, David would arrive.

1138
01:05:56,507 --> 01:05:59,021
I'd walk slowly
out of the room, into the hall.

1139
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:03,465
I'd greet him, tell him how fine
he's looking and so forth,

1140
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:05,618
and, uh... take his hat.

1141
01:06:07,747 --> 01:06:10,102
Then I'd bring him in here,

1142
01:06:10,427 --> 01:06:13,464
make some small talk
to put him at his ease,

1143
01:06:13,627 --> 01:06:16,016
probably offer him a drink,

1144
01:06:17,947 --> 01:06:20,017
- and then he'd sit down.
(Brandon) - Yes?

1145
01:06:20,187 --> 01:06:24,419
(Rupert) I'd try to make it all
very pleasant, you understand?

1146
01:06:24,587 --> 01:06:27,818
Phillip would probably play the piano.

1147
01:06:28,307 --> 01:06:32,016
Now, as I recall, David was quite strong.

1148
01:06:32,187 --> 01:06:34,655
He'd have to be knocked out.

1149
01:06:34,827 --> 01:06:40,663
So I'd move quietly behind the chair
and hit him on the head with something.

1150
01:06:40,867 --> 01:06:44,337
His body would fall forward on the floor.

1151
01:06:44,507 --> 01:06:47,465
(Brandon)
Then where would you put him?

1152
01:06:52,427 --> 01:06:55,305
(Rupert) Well, uh...

1153
01:06:57,187 --> 01:06:59,417
Well, let me see.

1154
01:07:02,107 --> 01:07:05,782
Well, I think I'd get Phillip
to help me carry him out of the room,

1155
01:07:05,947 --> 01:07:10,463
down the back stairs, and the
two of us would put him in the car.

1156
01:07:10,627 --> 01:07:12,265
- You'd be seen.
(Rupert) - What?

1157
01:07:12,427 --> 01:07:15,464
Well, you said yourself
that if anything did happen,

1158
01:07:15,627 --> 01:07:17,140
it must have happened in broad daylight.

1159
01:07:17,307 --> 01:07:18,945
Oh, that's right. I'd forgotten.

1160
01:07:19,107 --> 01:07:21,905
I'd have to find someplace
to hide the body until dark.

1161
01:07:22,067 --> 01:07:24,900
Yes, you would, but where, Rupert?

1162
01:07:26,507 --> 01:07:28,498
Yes.

1163
01:07:30,267 --> 01:07:32,258
Yes, where?

1164
01:07:35,187 --> 01:07:37,621
- Cat and mouse! Cat and mouse!
- Phillip!

1165
01:07:37,787 --> 01:07:40,585
- Which is the cat and which the mouse?
- That's enough of that.

1166
01:07:40,747 --> 01:07:42,863
- Mind your own business.
- That's enough, Phillip!

1167
01:07:43,027 --> 01:07:46,622
I told you before,
mind your own business!

1168
01:07:47,787 --> 01:07:51,177
It really isn't any of my business.
I'm not his keeper.

1169
01:07:53,547 --> 01:07:54,900
With him in this condition, though

1170
01:07:55,067 --> 01:07:58,298
there doesn't seem to be
much point in your staying, Rupert.

1171
01:07:58,467 --> 01:07:59,900
That is...

1172
01:08:00,067 --> 01:08:04,185
unless you came back to find something
besides your cigarette case.

1173
01:08:04,347 --> 01:08:07,498
You mean, for example,
to find if you really got rid of David?

1174
01:08:07,667 --> 01:08:10,898
- Yes, that's what I mean.
- Oh, you're as romantic as Janet.

1175
01:08:11,067 --> 01:08:14,139
I don't think for a moment
that you kidnapped David.

1176
01:08:14,307 --> 01:08:19,461
I'll admit Janet put the notion in my head,
but I never would have mentioned it,

1177
01:08:19,627 --> 01:08:23,984
if it weren't that you seem to be carrying
fear of discovery in your pocket.

1178
01:08:24,147 --> 01:08:25,978
- What?
- That's a gun, isn't it?

1179
01:08:26,787 --> 01:08:28,425
(Laughing)

1180
01:08:28,587 --> 01:08:31,226
That teased my suspicions
more than anything else.

1181
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:36,302
And to tell you the truth,
it really scares me a little.

1182
01:08:36,467 --> 01:08:41,222
I'm terribly sorry, Rupert.
I don't blame you, but... well, here.

1183
01:08:41,387 --> 01:08:43,582
You can relax.
I have to take it up to the country.

1184
01:08:43,747 --> 01:08:47,979
There have been several burglaries,
and mother's a bit on edge.

1185
01:08:48,147 --> 01:08:51,423
- Uh, finished, Phillip?
(Phillip) - Alright.

1186
01:08:51,587 --> 01:08:53,339
(Brandon) Did you hear
what Rupert said about the gun?

1187
01:08:53,507 --> 01:08:56,624
He thought... (Laughing)

1188
01:08:56,827 --> 01:09:00,615
It's odd the way one can pyramid
simple facts into wild fantasies, isn't it?

1189
01:09:00,787 --> 01:09:03,381
(Brandon) - We all do, don't we, Phillip ?
(Phillip) - Yeah.

1190
01:09:03,547 --> 01:09:07,506
(Brandon) Particularly after a few
drinks. How is yours, Rupert?

1191
01:09:07,667 --> 01:09:09,897
(Rupert) I think I'll be running along.

1192
01:09:10,067 --> 01:09:12,627
(Brandon) Phillip, you'll feel much
better once you get out in the open air.

1193
01:09:12,787 --> 01:09:16,143
I don't think there'll be much traffic
and we ought to make good time.

1194
01:09:16,307 --> 01:09:19,458
(Rupert) It's a lovely night
and you'll be driving up in good weather.

1195
01:09:19,627 --> 01:09:24,542
I almost wish I were going with you.
It might be rather exciting.

1196
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:27,221
Driving at night always is,

1197
01:09:27,387 --> 01:09:29,662
but driving with you and Phillip now...

1198
01:09:29,827 --> 01:09:33,820
might have an additional
element of, uh... suspense.

1199
01:09:35,387 --> 01:09:37,537
You were right, Phillip.

1200
01:09:37,707 --> 01:09:40,141
Those books were tied clumsily.

1201
01:09:40,307 --> 01:09:42,775
- He's got it. He's got it!
- Phillip.

1202
01:09:42,947 --> 01:09:45,017
He knows. He knows. He knows.

1203
01:09:45,187 --> 01:09:48,577
- Alright, easy. I'll take care of it.
- No, you won't.

1204
01:09:48,747 --> 01:09:53,025
I'd just as soon kill you
as kill him - Sooner.

1205
01:09:53,187 --> 01:09:55,655
This is what you wanted,
somebody else to know.

1206
01:09:55,827 --> 01:09:59,263
Somebody else to see how brilliant
you are, just like in school.

1207
01:09:59,427 --> 01:10:02,544
I told you he'd find out,
but you had to have him here.

1208
01:10:02,707 --> 01:10:04,584
- Now we're done for!
- Shut up!

1209
01:10:04,747 --> 01:10:07,739
You made me do it
and I hate both of you. I was -

1210
01:10:18,387 --> 01:10:19,536
(Gunshot)

1211
01:10:22,027 --> 01:10:26,737
- Stupid babbling drunk. I'm sorry, Rupert.
- It's alright.

1212
01:10:27,227 --> 01:10:30,537
It's alright. If you really want to kill,
you don't miss, not at that range.

1213
01:10:30,707 --> 01:10:32,345
Of course he didn't want to kill you.

1214
01:10:32,507 --> 01:10:35,817
He didn't know what he was doing, any
more than he knew what he was saying.

1215
01:10:35,987 --> 01:10:39,821
I didn't want anyone to know this but
he's becoming an alcoholic, Rupert -

1216
01:10:39,987 --> 01:10:42,547
Brandon,
will you step over there, please?

1217
01:10:42,707 --> 01:10:45,062
Phillip's drunk, Rupert.

1218
01:10:45,227 --> 01:10:48,139
Surely you don't take those
nightmare ideas of his seriously?

1219
01:10:48,307 --> 01:10:51,902
Brandon. Brandon, I'm tired.

1220
01:10:53,067 --> 01:10:56,343
And in a way, I'm frightened, too.

1221
01:10:56,507 --> 01:10:58,896
- But I don't want to fence anymore.
- What are you going to do?

1222
01:10:59,067 --> 01:11:03,538
I don't want to,
but I'm gonna look inside that chest.

1223
01:11:03,707 --> 01:11:05,538
- Are you crazy?
- I hope so.

1224
01:11:05,707 --> 01:11:09,336
- With all my heart I hope I'm crazy.
- This has nothing to do with you.

1225
01:11:09,507 --> 01:11:10,496
- I've got to.
- Don't.

1226
01:11:10,667 --> 01:11:14,023
- I have to look inside that chest.
- Alright!

1227
01:11:14,187 --> 01:11:16,178
Go ahead and look.

1228
01:11:16,347 --> 01:11:18,941
I hope you like what you see.

1229
01:11:35,147 --> 01:11:37,138
Oh, no. No!

1230
01:11:37,787 --> 01:11:41,905
(Brandon) - Rupert -
- I couldn't believe it was true.

1231
01:11:42,867 --> 01:11:44,903
- Rupert, please -
- Please what?

1232
01:11:45,067 --> 01:11:47,422
Listen to me. Let me explain.

1233
01:11:47,587 --> 01:11:49,623
Explain?
Do you think you can explain that?

1234
01:11:49,787 --> 01:11:52,699
- Yes, to you, because you'll understand.
- Understand?

1235
01:11:52,867 --> 01:11:56,542
Rupert, remember the discussion
we had before with Mr Kentley?

1236
01:11:56,707 --> 01:12:01,019
Remember we said, 'the lives
of inferior beings are unimportant'?

1237
01:12:01,187 --> 01:12:04,543
Remember we said,
we've always said, you and l,

1238
01:12:04,707 --> 01:12:08,746
that moral concepts of good and evil
and right and wrong

1239
01:12:08,907 --> 01:12:11,057
don't hold for the intellectually superior.

1240
01:12:11,227 --> 01:12:13,821
- Remember, Rupert?
- Yes, I remember.

1241
01:12:13,987 --> 01:12:17,866
(Brandon) That's all we've done.
That's all Phillip and I have done.

1242
01:12:18,027 --> 01:12:20,985
He and I have lived
what you and I have talked.

1243
01:12:21,147 --> 01:12:25,743
I knew you'd understand, because,
don't you see, you have to.

1244
01:12:39,267 --> 01:12:41,622
Brandon -

1245
01:12:44,147 --> 01:12:47,583
Brandon, till this very moment,

1246
01:12:48,827 --> 01:12:50,340
this world and the people in it

1247
01:12:50,507 --> 01:12:54,420
have always been dark
and incomprehensible to me.

1248
01:12:54,587 --> 01:12:58,102
I've tried to clear my way with logic

1249
01:12:58,267 --> 01:13:00,701
and superior intellect.

1250
01:13:00,867 --> 01:13:04,621
And you've thrown my own words
right back in my face, Brandon.

1251
01:13:04,787 --> 01:13:08,746
You were right, too. If nothing else,
a man should stand by his words.

1252
01:13:08,907 --> 01:13:13,742
But you've given my words
a meaning that I never dreamed of!

1253
01:13:13,907 --> 01:13:15,306
And you've tried to twist them

1254
01:13:15,467 --> 01:13:19,585
into a cold, logical excuse
for your ugly murder!

1255
01:13:20,747 --> 01:13:24,103
Well, they never were that, Brandon,

1256
01:13:24,267 --> 01:13:26,223
and you can't make them that.

1257
01:13:26,387 --> 01:13:29,857
There must have been something
deep inside you from the very start

1258
01:13:30,027 --> 01:13:33,099
that let you do this thing,

1259
01:13:33,267 --> 01:13:35,383
but there's always been
something deep inside me

1260
01:13:35,547 --> 01:13:37,856
that would never let me do it,

1261
01:13:38,027 --> 01:13:40,825
- and would never let me be a party to it.
- What do you mean?

1262
01:13:40,987 --> 01:13:44,946
I mean that tonight you've made me
ashamed of every concept I ever had

1263
01:13:45,107 --> 01:13:48,099
of superior or inferior beings.

1264
01:13:48,267 --> 01:13:50,986
But I thank you for that shame,

1265
01:13:51,147 --> 01:13:56,380
because now I know that we are each
of us a separate human being, Brandon,

1266
01:13:56,547 --> 01:14:00,460
with the right to live and work
and think as individuals,

1267
01:14:00,627 --> 01:14:03,619
but with an obligation
to the society we live in.

1268
01:14:04,907 --> 01:14:06,898
By what right do you dare say

1269
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:11,458
that there's a superior few
to which you belong?

1270
01:14:11,627 --> 01:14:13,822
By what right did you dare decide

1271
01:14:13,987 --> 01:14:19,505
that that boy in there was inferior
and therefore could be killed?

1272
01:14:19,667 --> 01:14:22,181
Did you think you were God, Brandon?

1273
01:14:22,347 --> 01:14:25,544
Is that what you thought
when you choked the life out of him?

1274
01:14:25,707 --> 01:14:28,938
Is that what you thought
when you served food from his grave?

1275
01:14:29,107 --> 01:14:32,656
I don't know what you thought,
but I know what you've done.

1276
01:14:32,827 --> 01:14:34,624
You've murdered!

1277
01:14:34,787 --> 01:14:37,381
You've strangled a fellow human being

1278
01:14:37,547 --> 01:14:41,017
who could live and love
as you never could.

1279
01:14:41,187 --> 01:14:42,825
- And never will again.
- What are you doing?

1280
01:14:42,987 --> 01:14:48,345
It's what society's going to do. I don't
know what that will be. I can guess.

1281
01:14:48,507 --> 01:14:52,500
And I can help. You're going to die,
Brandon, both of you!

1282
01:14:52,667 --> 01:14:55,306
You're going to die.

1283
01:15:09,787 --> 01:15:11,186
(Someone Running)

1284
01:15:23,107 --> 01:15:24,381
(Woman 3) There were shots fired!

1285
01:15:29,387 --> 01:15:33,221
(Man 2) I think that
somebody better call the police.

1286
01:15:33,387 --> 01:15:36,663
(Man 3)
Did any of you hear any shots fired?

1287
01:15:38,387 --> 01:15:43,017
(Man 2) Somebody better call
a squad car. Can I use your phone?
