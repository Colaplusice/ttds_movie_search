- Thank you, Doctor.
- I'll send over some Aureomycin.

That's every four hours
for that one, isn't it?

Yes. The caffeine if he feels weak...

664

and the Demerol
if the pain gets very bad.

- Say, about every three hours.
- I got it.

him a shot of tetanus-gas gangrene antitoxin.

He walked around with a burst appendix
for three days...

he'd take her to a square dance.
