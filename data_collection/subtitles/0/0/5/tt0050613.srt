11
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:49,133  X1:236 X2:471 Y1:403 Y2:433
Look upon the ruins

12
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,899  X1:213 X2:495 Y1:403 Y2:427
Of the castle of delusion

13
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:05,010  X1:247 X2:463 Y1:403 Y2:433
Haunted only now

14
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:08,015  X1:278 X2:430 Y1:403 Y2:433
By the spirits

15
00:03:09,455 --> 00:03:14,483  X1:223 X2:489 Y1:403 Y2:433
Of those who perished

16
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:27,363  X1:240 X2:464 Y1:403 Y2:433
A scene of carnage

17
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:36,007  X1:204 X2:503 Y1:403 Y2:433
Born of consuming desire

18
00:03:39,018 --> 00:03:46,151  X1:260 X2:449 Y1:403 Y2:433
Never changing

19
00:03:48,161 --> 00:03:53,656  X1:181 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Now and throughout eternity

HERE STOOD
SPIDER'S WEB CASTLE

21
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:29,321  X1:253 X2:464 Y1:371 Y2:427
Fujimaki mutinies
at North Garrison.

22
00:05:29,529 --> 00:05:34,728  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:371 Y2:427
Caught unawares, fire ravages
the Fourth and Fifth Fortresses.

23
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,802  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:427
And the Third Fortress?

24
00:05:36,903 --> 00:05:40,464  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:371 Y2:433
The Third Fortress had no time
to prepare itself.

25
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:42,404  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:403 Y2:427
And the Second Fortress?

26
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:48,770  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:371 Y2:427
Fighting like a man possessed,
Second Fortress commander Miki

27
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:51,848  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:371 Y2:427
has redeployed men
of the Third Fortress.

28
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:53,475  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:404 Y2:427
Our First Fortress?

29
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,181  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:371 Y2:430
As flames engulfed
the Fourth and Fifth Fortresses,

30
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:02,418  X1:197 X2:522 Y1:372 Y2:430
First Fortress,
under commander Washizu,

31
00:06:02,628 --> 00:06:06,724  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:371 Y2:433
came under assault from Inui's men,
some 400 strong,

32
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:09,427  X1:239 X2:479 Y1:371 Y2:427
who poured across
our border full force.

33
00:06:09,635 --> 00:06:12,433  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:403 Y2:430
So, this is Inui's scheme.

34
00:06:12,538 --> 00:06:15,666  X1:140 X2:577 Y1:403 Y2:427
And how does Washizu fare in battle?

35
00:06:15,775 --> 00:06:17,402  X1:279 X2:437 Y1:403 Y2:433
A bitter fight.

36
00:06:18,411 --> 00:06:20,641  X1:245 X2:471 Y1:403 Y2:427
Attend to this man.

37
00:06:37,363 --> 00:06:39,058  X1:269 X2:450 Y1:403 Y2:427
Shall we strike?

38
00:06:39,265 --> 00:06:42,200  X1:147 X2:572 Y1:403 Y2:427
Or barricade ourselves in this castle?

39
00:07:02,088 --> 00:07:05,057  X1:169 X2:548 Y1:403 Y2:427
We must confine ourselves here.

40
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:12,524  X1:124 X2:593 Y1:371 Y2:433
Striking at forces bent on victory
will only bring greater injury to our men.

41
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,896  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:372 Y2:433
First, post sentries
at the edges of Spider's Web Forest,

42
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:22,397  X1:195 X2:524 Y1:371 Y2:433
divide our foe's forces
by luring them into its maze,

43
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:25,736  X1:183 X2:534 Y1:403 Y2:433
and wound as many as we can.

44
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:28,914  X1:189 X2:528 Y1:371 Y2:427
Then withdraw
and barricade ourselves here.

45
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,811  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:403 Y2:433
This would be my strategy.

46
00:07:37,323 --> 00:07:38,290  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:403 Y2:433
Our supplies?

47
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:46,660  X1:182 X2:534 Y1:371 Y2:433
We can eke out three months,
slurping gruel.

48
00:07:55,041 --> 00:07:56,303  X1:279 X2:426 Y1:403 Y2:433
I bring word.

49
00:07:56,409 --> 00:07:59,742  X1:203 X2:502 Y1:373 Y2:427
I am a messenger
from the Second Fortress.

50
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:01,846  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:403 Y2:427
Let him enter.

51
00:08:03,583 --> 00:08:04,550  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:403 Y2:427
Let him enter.

52
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:19,323  X1:166 X2:554 Y1:403 Y2:433
Lord, the tides of battle favor you.

53
00:08:19,432 --> 00:08:20,194  X1:289 X2:432 Y1:403 Y2:427
How is that?

54
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:28,297  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:371 Y2:433
Even as Miki's valiant defense
exhausted our foe's strategies,

55
00:08:28,508 --> 00:08:32,467  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:371 Y2:430
Washizu tore through
Inui's lines at the First Fortress,

56
00:08:32,678 --> 00:08:35,010  X1:190 X2:529 Y1:403 Y2:433
raining arrows on their ranks.

57
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:36,706  X1:250 X2:469 Y1:371 Y2:427
- Washizu did this?
- Yes.

58
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:39,580  X1:257 X2:459 Y1:403 Y2:427
Washizu did that.

59
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,677  X1:193 X2:526 Y1:371 Y2:433
Washizu's gambit
has easily wasted our enemy,

60
00:08:42,889 --> 00:08:45,915  X1:207 X2:512 Y1:371 Y2:433
and turned the tide of war
to our advantage.

61
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:52,328  X1:129 X2:590 Y1:371 Y2:433
Lord, even now Washizu and Miki's men
have driven the enemy back,

62
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:54,193  X1:183 X2:535 Y1:403 Y2:433
trapping them in the Garrison.

63
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,293  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord.

64
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:57,865  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord.

65
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,628  X1:189 X2:532 Y1:371 Y2:433
At the Garrison,
Fujimaki prepares to abdicate

66
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:03,706  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:403 Y2:433
and begs for peace.

67
00:09:03,809 --> 00:09:05,902  X1:187 X2:532 Y1:403 Y2:433
No, we shall not talk of peace.

68
00:09:06,012 --> 00:09:07,570  X1:306 X2:414 Y1:404 Y2:433
Noriyasu.

69
00:09:09,916 --> 00:09:12,680  X1:209 X2:509 Y1:371 Y2:427
Take your men
to North Garrison at once

70
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,115  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:403 Y2:433
and slay Fujimaki.

71
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:21,225  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:371 Y2:427
Fortify our border positions,
and if Inui refuses to move his men...

72
00:09:21,427 --> 00:09:25,454  X1:191 X2:528 Y1:371 Y2:433
Bring Washizu and Miki here.
I wish to thank them myself.

73
00:09:38,511 --> 00:09:40,172  X1:260 X2:457 Y1:403 Y2:433
What is this day?

74
00:09:40,379 --> 00:09:42,540  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
I have never seen
such peculiar weather.

75
00:09:45,184 --> 00:09:48,745  X1:216 X2:504 Y1:371 Y2:433
Make haste. I wish to see
our Lord's joyous face.

76
00:09:50,089 --> 00:09:51,556  X1:316 X2:402 Y1:403 Y2:427
Indeed.

77
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:39,228  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:403 Y2:430
No, this is...

78
00:10:39,672 --> 00:10:42,766  X1:201 X2:516 Y1:371 Y2:433
the very path where
we last stopped our beasts.

79
00:10:42,875 --> 00:10:46,504  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:427
Indeed, see the hoof marks
where our horses tread.

80
00:10:49,215 --> 00:10:50,648  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:403 Y2:433
This is baffling.

81
00:10:50,850 --> 00:10:53,182  X1:155 X2:565 Y1:403 Y2:433
Is not this the Spider's Web Forest?

82
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:54,512  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:403 Y2:433
Without question.

83
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:58,085  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:371 Y2:433
Then the castle
must be but very near.

84
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,526  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:427
We have wandered
the forest two hours now.

85
00:11:02,728 --> 00:11:04,127  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:403 Y2:433
Finding no outlet.

86
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:08,293  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:403 Y2:433
The infamous Spider's Web Forest.

87
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:10,867  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:403 Y2:433
Stretching out like a spider's web,

88
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:15,131  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:433
protecting Spider's Web Castle
against all foes.

89
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:17,703  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:403 Y2:427
Ridiculous.

90
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:22,643  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:433
Though perilous to our foes,
surely we know this forest well.

91
00:11:36,862 --> 00:11:39,524  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:371 Y2:427
Hear that?
There's evil afoot.

92
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:41,866  X1:230 X2:486 Y1:403 Y2:433
That was an evil spirit.

93
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:47,929  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:371 Y2:433
Then I'll trust my spear
to conquer it and pass.

94
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:51,339  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:433
And I shall depend upon
my faithful bow and arrow.

95
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,408  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is that?

96
00:12:29,982 --> 00:12:32,246  X1:205 X2:516 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do you recall such a hovel?

97
00:12:32,451 --> 00:12:35,682  X1:178 X2:541 Y1:403 Y2:433
No, the sight is new to my eyes.

98
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:39,588  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Also the work of an evil spirit.

99
00:12:39,792 --> 00:12:40,850  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:403 Y2:433
And yet...

100
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:44,461  X1:216 X2:500 Y1:371 Y2:433
Look at the horses.
They're out of their wits.

101
00:12:54,340 --> 00:13:02,440  X1:235 X2:474 Y1:403 Y2:433
Strange is the world

102
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:06,915  X1:258 X2:452 Y1:403 Y2:433
Why should men

103
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:12,457  X1:206 X2:504 Y1:403 Y2:427
Receive life in this world?

104
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:18,262  X1:177 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Men's lives are as meaningless

105
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:22,727  X1:226 X2:478 Y1:403 Y2:427
As the lives of insects

106
00:13:24,203 --> 00:13:29,231  X1:260 X2:454 Y1:403 Y2:433
The terrible folly

107
00:13:30,109 --> 00:13:35,741  X1:255 X2:455 Y1:403 Y2:433
Of such suffering

108
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:43,683  X1:261 X2:445 Y1:403 Y2:427
A man lives but

109
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,126  X1:231 X2:476 Y1:403 Y2:433
As briefly as a flower

110
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:55,698  X1:230 X2:478 Y1:403 Y2:427
Destined all too soon

111
00:13:56,535 --> 00:14:01,700  X1:179 X2:532 Y1:403 Y2:433
To decay into the stink of flesh

112
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:09,278  X1:255 X2:452 Y1:404 Y2:433
Humanity strives

113
00:14:09,481 --> 00:14:13,850  X1:288 X2:416 Y1:403 Y2:433
All its days

114
00:14:15,454 --> 00:14:21,222  X1:238 X2:472 Y1:403 Y2:427
To sear its own flesh

115
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:26,529  X1:195 X2:512 Y1:403 Y2:427
In the flames of base desire

116
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:34,163  X1:269 X2:446 Y1:403 Y2:433
Exposing itself

117
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:39,370  X1:214 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:427
To Fate's Five Calamities

118
00:14:41,547 --> 00:14:49,716  X1:192 X2:516 Y1:403 Y2:433
Heaping karma upon karma

119
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:55,856  X1:238 X2:467 Y1:403 Y2:427
All that awaits Man

120
00:14:56,362 --> 00:15:00,196  X1:288 X2:419 Y1:403 Y2:427
At the end

121
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,530  X1:276 X2:433 Y1:403 Y2:427
Of his travails

122
00:15:05,604 --> 00:15:10,564  X1:190 X2:518 Y1:403 Y2:433
Is the stench of rotting flesh

123
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,713  X1:167 X2:547 Y1:403 Y2:433
That will yet blossom into flower

124
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:24,746  X1:226 X2:485 Y1:403 Y2:427
Its foul odor rendered

125
00:15:24,957 --> 00:15:30,418  X1:239 X2:469 Y1:403 Y2:433
Into sweet perfume

126
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:36,200  X1:267 X2:444 Y1:403 Y2:433
Oh, fascinating

127
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:44,601  X1:269 X2:441 Y1:403 Y2:427
The life of Man

128
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:50,141  X1:267 X2:444 Y1:403 Y2:433
Oh, fascinating

129
00:16:03,595 --> 00:16:04,425  X1:278 X2:439 Y1:403 Y2:433
Who are you?

130
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:07,497  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:371 Y2:433
Are you human
or of the spirit world?

131
00:16:08,667 --> 00:16:11,465  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:433
Speak now. If you can sing,
surely you can speak.

132
00:16:11,670 --> 00:16:13,262  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:404 Y2:427
Yes.

133
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:18,098  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:403 Y2:427
Washizu Taketoki.

134
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:22,738  X1:167 X2:550 Y1:403 Y2:427
Commander of the First Fortress.

135
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:25,439  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:427
What? You know of me?

136
00:16:25,651 --> 00:16:26,948  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:404 Y2:427
Yes.

137
00:16:28,153 --> 00:16:33,022  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:371 Y2:427
From this day forward,
Lord of the North Garrison.

138
00:16:33,125 --> 00:16:36,526  X1:184 X2:532 Y1:371 Y2:433
What? Lord of North Garrison
from this day?

139
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,694  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:404 Y2:427
Yes.

140
00:16:39,465 --> 00:16:43,561  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:403 Y2:433
One day, you shall also be Sovereign

141
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,796  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:403 Y2:433
over Spider's Web Castle.

142
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:52,467  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:371 Y2:433
How dare you.
Cease your jesting.

143
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:57,308  X1:206 X2:512 Y1:403 Y2:433
Why should you show fury

144
00:16:57,516 --> 00:17:02,317  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:403 Y2:433
when my tidings are so joyous?

145
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:05,354  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:371 Y2:433
Our Great Lord
is the only lord of the castle.

146
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:11,360  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Human beings are so strange.

147
00:17:12,564 --> 00:17:18,230  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:371 Y2:427
Terrified to look into
the bottom of their own hearts.

148
00:17:25,077 --> 00:17:26,476  X1:299 X2:418 Y1:404 Y2:427
Wait now.

149
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,007  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:371 Y2:433
Though this may be
a spirit creature,

150
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:35,847  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:371 Y2:433
it would not jest
with your arrow poised at its heart.

151
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,913  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:433
Let me question further.

152
00:17:39,558 --> 00:17:42,026  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:403 Y2:427
Answer me this.

153
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:48,899  X1:185 X2:533 Y1:371 Y2:433
Do you see into the future
as clearly as my eyes now see?

154
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,398  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:404 Y2:427
Yes.

155
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:54,934  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:403 Y2:427
Miki Yoshiaki.

156
00:17:55,741 --> 00:17:59,507  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:403 Y2:427
Commander of the Second Fortress.

157
00:18:00,112 --> 00:18:04,606  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:371 Y2:427
And henceforward,
commander of the First Fortress.

158
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:09,082  X1:188 X2:530 Y1:371 Y2:427
Even today,
commander of First Fortress?

159
00:18:13,459 --> 00:18:16,223  X1:155 X2:562 Y1:403 Y2:433
And my realm and rank thereafter?

160
00:18:17,996 --> 00:18:20,726  X1:285 X2:433 Y1:403 Y2:433
Your destiny

161
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:25,063  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:371 Y2:427
is both smaller and greater
than that of Washizu.

162
00:18:25,938 --> 00:18:26,768  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:403 Y2:427
What?

163
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,098  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:403 Y2:433
What can you mean by this?

164
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:33,574  X1:311 X2:408 Y1:403 Y2:433
One day

165
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,577  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:403 Y2:433
your son shall rule

166
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,650  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:403 Y2:433
Spider's Web Castle.

167
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,496  X1:233 X2:484 Y1:403 Y2:430
Ah, there's the castle.

168
00:22:51,236 --> 00:22:55,002  X1:178 X2:542 Y1:371 Y2:433
Finally free of that spider's web.
Come, at a gallop.

169
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:56,868  X1:309 X2:411 Y1:404 Y2:430
No, wait.

170
00:22:57,576 --> 00:23:02,070  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:433
My fatigue is great. My armor
weighs heavily, as never before.

171
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,580  X1:265 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:427
And no wonder.

172
00:23:04,783 --> 00:23:07,980  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:433
We've tired three mounts
since yesterday's battle.

173
00:23:08,186 --> 00:23:09,653  X1:279 X2:439 Y1:403 Y2:427
Shall we rest?

174
00:23:22,567 --> 00:23:24,501  X1:294 X2:425 Y1:403 Y2:433
I'm drowsy.

175
00:23:25,804 --> 00:23:29,831  X1:205 X2:514 Y1:371 Y2:433
I desire nothing more than
a deep, restful sleep.

176
00:23:32,611 --> 00:23:37,207  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
I can't help but feel
this is already a dream.

177
00:23:38,150 --> 00:23:40,744  X1:184 X2:535 Y1:403 Y2:433
Our encounter with that spirit

178
00:23:40,952 --> 00:23:43,785  X1:194 X2:525 Y1:403 Y2:433
may well have been a dream.

179
00:23:43,989 --> 00:23:47,390  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:427
They say dreams manifest
our basest desires.

180
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:53,420  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:371 Y2:433
In truth, who would not dream
of ruling over a vanquished castle?

181
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:58,702  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:427
It seems your son shall become
Great Lord of that castle.

182
00:23:58,904 --> 00:24:03,898  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:371 Y2:427
No, it is you, yourself,
who shall rule over that castle.

183
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:13,282  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:371 Y2:427
But first, I must become
Lord of the North Garrison.

184
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,885  X1:236 X2:483 Y1:371 Y2:427
And I, commander of
the First Fortress.

185
00:24:16,087 --> 00:24:17,577  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:371 Y2:433
- Joyous tidings.
- Joyous tidings.

186
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:28,659  X1:322 X2:395 Y1:372 Y2:427
- Yet...
- Yet...

187
00:24:29,501 --> 00:24:33,961  X1:154 X2:564 Y1:371 Y2:433
- What? What did you mean to say?
- No, what did you?

188
00:24:37,175 --> 00:24:41,134  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:403 Y2:433
And yet, what if as of this night,

189
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:44,444  X1:149 X2:569 Y1:403 Y2:430
I do become Lord of North Garrison,

190
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:47,482  X1:163 X2:554 Y1:403 Y2:433
and you command First Fortress...

191
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,317  X1:149 X2:570 Y1:403 Y2:433
Most distinguished warrior in battle,

192
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,511  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:403 Y2:427
Washizu Taketoki.

193
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:38,266  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:371 Y2:427
Henceforward, you are
Lord of North Garrison.

194
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,382  X1:280 X2:439 Y1:403 Y2:427
Miki Yoshiaki.

195
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:57,817  X1:133 X2:584 Y1:403 Y2:433
Your service was equally distinguished.

196
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,933  X1:220 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:433
From this night forward,

197
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,334  X1:168 X2:549 Y1:403 Y2:427
commander of our First Fortress.

198
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:29,313  X1:259 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
Awfully peaceful.

199
00:27:29,514 --> 00:27:32,142  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:403 Y2:433
Surely, this is paradise.

200
00:27:32,450 --> 00:27:35,578  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:371 Y2:427
Vastly superior to
the discomfort of a fortress.

201
00:27:35,787 --> 00:27:38,119  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:403 Y2:433
Life can always be improved.

202
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,814  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:403 Y2:430
Fine fortune for we who serve them,

203
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:44,689  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:371 Y2:427
but our Lord and Lady
must be well satisfied.

204
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:23,061  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:403 Y2:433
Is your heart resolved?

205
00:28:23,268 --> 00:28:24,292  X1:340 X2:380 Y1:404 Y2:427
No.

206
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:29,405  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:403 Y2:427
I dreamt an evil dream.

207
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:33,802  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:403 Y2:433
Beguiled by a wicked spirit.

208
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:36,474  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:403 Y2:433
But I no longer waver.

209
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:41,042  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:371 Y2:433
Preposterous, to wish I were
Lord of Spider's Web Castle.

210
00:28:41,252 --> 00:28:45,552  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do not call your dream preposterous.

211
00:28:46,024 --> 00:28:51,326  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:371 Y2:427
Any man who takes bow in hand
would dream of such a fate.

212
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:52,860  X1:340 X2:380 Y1:404 Y2:427
No.

213
00:28:55,266 --> 00:28:58,099  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:403 Y2:433
I prefer to remain here.

214
00:28:58,937 --> 00:29:02,839  X1:209 X2:512 Y1:371 Y2:427
I will serve my Lord loyally
from this Garrison.

215
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:06,366  X1:211 X2:507 Y1:371 Y2:433
Savor the peace
of a life befitting my rank.

216
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:09,878  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:371 Y2:427
- That shall not come to pass.
- What?

217
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,176  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:403 Y2:427
What if Miki Yoshiaki should disclose

218
00:29:14,385 --> 00:29:18,719  X1:203 X2:516 Y1:371 Y2:427
the forest spirit's prophecy
to our Great Lord?

219
00:29:20,792 --> 00:29:24,125  X1:212 X2:504 Y1:371 Y2:427
If that comes to pass,
we shall not survive here.

220
00:29:25,663 --> 00:29:29,963  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:371 Y2:430
At once, the Great Lord would
surround this castle with his men,

221
00:29:30,168 --> 00:29:35,800  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:433
jealous of the threat
you pose to his hegemony.

222
00:29:39,244 --> 00:29:42,645  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:371 Y2:433
My Lord, you have
but two paths ahead.

223
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:48,218  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:433
Remain here and patiently wait
for our Great Lord to slay you,

224
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:53,583  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:371 Y2:433
or slay him first and become
the Lord of Spider's Web Castle.

225
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,762  X1:225 X2:491 Y1:371 Y2:433
Slaying the Great Lord
would be high treason.

226
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:09,439  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:403 Y2:427
Did not the Great Lord

227
00:30:09,641 --> 00:30:14,340  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:371 Y2:433
secure his own position
murdering his predecessor?

228
00:30:14,445 --> 00:30:19,280  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:371 Y2:433
No, only because his own Lord
doubted him and sought his death.

229
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:25,350  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:403 Y2:427
Our Great Lord trusts me.

230
00:30:26,024 --> 00:30:28,356  X1:186 X2:534 Y1:403 Y2:427
He treasures me like no other.

231
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:34,430  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:371 Y2:433
Only because he does not know
the depths of your heart.

232
00:30:35,834 --> 00:30:37,665  X1:303 X2:418 Y1:403 Y2:433
My heart?

233
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,328  X1:191 X2:525 Y1:403 Y2:433
There is nothing in my heart.

234
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:46,474  X1:290 X2:427 Y1:403 Y2:427
That is a lie.

235
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,179  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:403 Y2:427
Ridiculous.

236
00:30:51,816 --> 00:30:56,344  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:371 Y2:433
I am... perfectly content
with my station at North Garrison.

237
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:59,716  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:403 Y2:430
Even if that were true,

238
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:03,883  X1:198 X2:519 Y1:371 Y2:430
do you think the Great Lord
will trust it is so,

239
00:31:04,095 --> 00:31:07,861  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:371 Y2:433
should Miki inform him
of that prophecy?

240
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,826  X1:314 X2:406 Y1:403 Y2:427
Miki is...

241
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:15,733  X1:229 X2:489 Y1:371 Y2:427
Miki is my beloved
friend from childhood.

242
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,905  X1:206 X2:514 Y1:403 Y2:433
He is incapable of betrayal.

243
00:31:18,109 --> 00:31:21,169  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:403 Y2:430
To advance themselves in this world,

244
00:31:21,379 --> 00:31:25,907  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:433
parents will kill children,
and children, their parents.

245
00:31:27,018 --> 00:31:33,048  X1:159 X2:559 Y1:371 Y2:427
In this degenerate age,
one must kill so as not to be killed.

246
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:40,724  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:371 Y2:433
I cannot help wondering if Miki
has already informed the Great Lord.

247
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:44,326  X1:180 X2:538 Y1:403 Y2:433
I have no respite from this fear.

248
00:31:48,273 --> 00:31:51,538  X1:237 X2:480 Y1:371 Y2:433
Asaji. Do not speak
of your doubts again.

249
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,108  X1:323 X2:382 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord.

250
00:31:57,849 --> 00:32:01,876  X1:137 X2:580 Y1:371 Y2:433
I've word. 300 men of
Spider's Web Castle lurk in the woods.

251
00:32:02,086 --> 00:32:04,452  X1:175 X2:542 Y1:403 Y2:433
They have assembled in silence.

252
00:32:04,656 --> 00:32:07,124  X1:302 X2:403 Y1:403 Y2:433
My Lord.

253
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:16,399  X1:128 X2:589 Y1:371 Y2:430
The forests surrounding North Garrison
are thick with armed men,

254
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,069  X1:193 X2:524 Y1:403 Y2:433
all from Spider's Web Castle.

255
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:24,207  X1:158 X2:559 Y1:371 Y2:433
Their flags and spears are lowered,
their horses bridled with twigs.

256
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,814  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:371 Y2:427
News for Washizu,
Lord of North Garrison.

257
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:42,652  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:403 Y2:433
The Great Lord approaches.

258
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:46,864  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is it?

259
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,159  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:403 Y2:433
My Lord, the Great Lord approaches.

260
00:32:50,368 --> 00:32:52,165  X1:234 X2:486 Y1:403 Y2:433
Men, form your ranks.

261
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,233  X1:263 X2:456 Y1:403 Y2:433
Form your ranks.

262
00:32:58,543 --> 00:33:00,238  X1:291 X2:428 Y1:403 Y2:430
Fall in, men.

263
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:02,106  X1:206 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:430
Washizu, there is no need.

264
00:33:02,213 --> 00:33:04,943  X1:235 X2:482 Y1:371 Y2:433
The Great Lord is out
hunting incognito.

265
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,744  X1:221 X2:497 Y1:371 Y2:433
And thus no need
for an official reception.

266
00:34:02,507 --> 00:34:06,568  X1:235 X2:483 Y1:371 Y2:433
My congratulations
on your bountiful kill.

267
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:10,238  X1:192 X2:529 Y1:403 Y2:433
No, the hunt is only a pretext

268
00:34:13,017 --> 00:34:15,679  X1:209 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:427
that I may deploy my men
to attack Inui.

269
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:21,216  X1:198 X2:520 Y1:403 Y2:427
Inui's behavior is untenable.

270
00:34:21,325 --> 00:34:24,123  X1:184 X2:536 Y1:403 Y2:433
Knowing this day would come,

271
00:34:24,328 --> 00:34:26,922  X1:203 X2:518 Y1:371 Y2:433
I overlooked his conspiracy
with Fujimaki.

272
00:34:27,298 --> 00:34:31,428  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:371 Y2:430
Take heed. Hereafter, I quarter
at North Garrison here,

273
00:34:31,869 --> 00:34:36,329  X1:139 X2:578 Y1:371 Y2:433
secretly fortify our border,
and attack when opportunity permits.

274
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:40,637  X1:169 X2:550 Y1:403 Y2:433
Until then, not a word to anyone.

275
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:44,406  X1:299 X2:419 Y1:371 Y2:427
- Washizu.
- Sir.

276
00:34:44,515 --> 00:34:46,608  X1:322 X2:396 Y1:371 Y2:427
- Miki.
- Sir.

277
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:49,043  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:403 Y2:433
I elevate you in recognition

278
00:34:49,153 --> 00:34:50,211  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:403 Y2:433
of your courage.

279
00:34:50,588 --> 00:34:53,751  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:371 Y2:433
Washizu take my vanguard,
Miki, Spider's Web Castle.

280
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,847  X1:332 X2:385 Y1:372 Y2:427
- Sir.
- Sir.

281
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:10,063  X1:327 X2:389 Y1:404 Y2:433
Asaji.

282
00:35:11,709 --> 00:35:15,145  X1:207 X2:514 Y1:371 Y2:433
Now your suspicious heart
must find respite.

283
00:35:18,549 --> 00:35:22,007  X1:210 X2:508 Y1:403 Y2:427
Our Great Lord trusts me.

284
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:29,057  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:371 Y2:433
In your uneasy heart that would
slander Miki, that evil spirit lurks.

285
00:35:29,260 --> 00:35:31,592  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:404 Y2:433
I cannot agree.

286
00:35:34,298 --> 00:35:36,926  X1:203 X2:513 Y1:403 Y2:433
And still you doubt. Listen.

287
00:35:38,069 --> 00:35:41,869  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:371 Y2:427
Great Lord places his trust in me
above all others.

288
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:47,402  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:371 Y2:433
Thus he gives me the noble rank
of vanguard commander.

289
00:35:47,612 --> 00:35:50,206  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:403 Y2:433
This vanguard commander

290
00:35:50,414 --> 00:35:53,713  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
is vulnerable to arrows
on every side.

291
00:36:01,425 --> 00:36:04,223  X1:251 X2:467 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord is a fox.

292
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:08,362  X1:177 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:430
With easy words, he cheats you
of the North Garrison,

293
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,597  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:403 Y2:427
sends his trusted Miki

294
00:36:11,802 --> 00:36:15,932  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:371 Y2:433
out of danger
to guard Spider's Web Castle,

295
00:36:17,008 --> 00:36:20,967  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:371 Y2:433
and casts you, his most hated
adversary, into danger.

296
00:36:25,416 --> 00:36:28,874  X1:152 X2:567 Y1:403 Y2:433
From the heights of the castle keep,

297
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:34,422  X1:168 X2:551 Y1:371 Y2:433
Miki will laugh as he watches you
take your last gullible breath.

298
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:51,207  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:427
- Who's there?
- We are with the Garrison.

299
00:36:52,343 --> 00:36:56,245  X1:192 X2:524 Y1:371 Y2:433
That way lie the Great Lord's
sleeping quarters.

300
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:58,607  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:403 Y2:433
No one may approach them.

301
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,014  X1:211 X2:508 Y1:403 Y2:433
I do not seek his quarters.

302
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:03,449  X1:167 X2:552 Y1:403 Y2:427
I come to air the sealed chamber.

303
00:37:04,488 --> 00:37:05,512  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:403 Y2:427
Sealed chamber?

304
00:37:06,691 --> 00:37:10,650  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:371 Y2:433
The place where the former Lord,
Fujimaki, took his life.

305
00:37:11,562 --> 00:37:14,588  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:371 Y2:430
No scrubbing will cleanse
the bloodstained floor,

306
00:37:14,799 --> 00:37:17,461  X1:232 X2:488 Y1:371 Y2:427
and thus the chamber
remains locked.

307
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:20,264  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:403 Y2:433
Why open the room on such a night?

308
00:37:21,405 --> 00:37:24,135  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:371 Y2:430
The Great Lord sleeps
in our Lord's chambers,

309
00:37:24,342 --> 00:37:26,207  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:403 Y2:427
thus he must rest here.

310
00:37:26,711 --> 00:37:30,477  X1:205 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:433
I thank you for your labors.
You may pass.

311
00:38:25,102 --> 00:38:26,729  X1:278 X2:442 Y1:403 Y2:433
Most peculiar.

312
00:38:28,272 --> 00:38:33,335  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:371 Y2:430
Though I have waded through
endless mires of battle dead,

313
00:38:34,078 --> 00:38:37,878  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:371 Y2:433
these blood stains never
fail to chill my spine.

314
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:46,623  X1:231 X2:488 Y1:403 Y2:433
For this is dog's blood.

315
00:38:46,824 --> 00:38:50,260  X1:177 X2:539 Y1:403 Y2:427
The blood of a traitor most foul

316
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,861  X1:156 X2:560 Y1:403 Y2:430
who, when his rash schemes failed,

317
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:57,626  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:371 Y2:427
begged our Great Lord for his life.
This is coward's blood.

318
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:15,915  X1:151 X2:568 Y1:403 Y2:433
Damn, even the birds cry ominously.

319
00:39:26,797 --> 00:39:30,824  X1:238 X2:480 Y1:371 Y2:433
You accuse me of
doubting too deeply.

320
00:39:31,369 --> 00:39:33,963  X1:188 X2:529 Y1:403 Y2:433
Yet even my distrustful heart,

321
00:39:34,171 --> 00:39:38,505  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:371 Y2:433
cannot help but trust
that spirit's prophecy.

322
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:42,942  X1:145 X2:573 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open your eyes and look for yourself.

323
00:39:43,714 --> 00:39:46,581  X1:214 X2:507 Y1:371 Y2:433
Each truthful provision of
that prophecy

324
00:39:46,784 --> 00:39:52,017  X1:150 X2:567 Y1:371 Y2:433
has come to pass,
without the slightest help from you.

325
00:39:54,859 --> 00:39:57,919  X1:178 X2:543 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do you still not comprehend it?

326
00:39:58,863 --> 00:40:04,324  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:371 Y2:433
The Great Lord himself
has flown into your very hands.

327
00:40:06,036 --> 00:40:11,668  X1:110 X2:607 Y1:371 Y2:433
If you let this night pass,
such an opportunity will never come again.

328
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,678  X1:304 X2:413 Y1:403 Y2:433
And yet...

329
00:40:24,822 --> 00:40:27,052  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:371 Y2:433
under what pretext
can I commit high treason?

330
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:30,819  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
In any case, all his men
will turn against me.

331
00:40:31,028 --> 00:40:34,191  X1:225 X2:492 Y1:371 Y2:433
Though the Great Lord
claims to trust you,

332
00:40:34,398 --> 00:40:40,166  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:371 Y2:433
he's left Noriyasu's men to guard him.
This is our good fortune.

333
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:45,876  X1:144 X2:573 Y1:371 Y2:433
We'll quench their thirst
with a sleeping potion mixed in sake.

334
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:50,206  X1:192 X2:525 Y1:371 Y2:433
As his guards dream,
you shall slay the Great Lord,

335
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:54,482  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:371 Y2:427
and denounce Noriyasu
as the murderer to his own men.

336
00:41:05,896 --> 00:41:09,593  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:403 Y2:433
What do you hear in that bird's cry?

337
00:41:14,238 --> 00:41:16,570  X1:211 X2:506 Y1:403 Y2:433
"Will you risk the world?"

338
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:20,235  X1:249 X2:469 Y1:403 Y2:427
So it sounds to me.

339
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:30,220  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:403 Y2:427
Ambition makes the man.

340
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:32,718  X1:148 X2:571 Y1:403 Y2:433
From your stronghold, Spider's Web,

341
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:37,519  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:371 Y2:433
you may yet aspire to all the world.
The cry is from heaven.

342
00:42:07,525 --> 00:42:08,822  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:403 Y2:427
Who's there?

343
00:42:09,493 --> 00:42:11,927  X1:165 X2:543 Y1:403 Y2:433
Your sleeping quarters are ready.

344
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,232  X1:292 X2:426 Y1:403 Y2:427
Good work.

345
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:24,068  X1:217 X2:502 Y1:371 Y2:433
And how did you leave
the Great Lord's guards?

346
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,641  X1:186 X2:521 Y1:371 Y2:433
Spears poised, they maintain
their sleepless vigil.

347
00:42:27,845 --> 00:42:29,972  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:403 Y2:433
Indeed they do.

348
00:42:31,649 --> 00:42:34,982  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:403 Y2:430
Let us offer them some sake, then.

349
00:49:12,449 --> 00:49:14,940  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:403 Y2:427
Intruders! Intruders!

350
00:49:23,727 --> 00:49:24,989  X1:295 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
Take arms!

351
00:49:29,132 --> 00:49:31,760  X1:197 X2:519 Y1:403 Y2:433
The Great Lord is in danger.

352
00:49:44,548 --> 00:49:46,311  X1:315 X2:402 Y1:404 Y2:427
Traitor.

353
00:50:26,957 --> 00:50:29,721  X1:189 X2:529 Y1:372 Y2:433
- Let me go.
- You must hold your temper.

354
00:50:29,826 --> 00:50:32,818  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:403 Y2:430
First, back to the castle, Prince.

355
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,588  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:404 Y2:433
Let me go.

356
00:50:35,298 --> 00:50:37,391  X1:190 X2:527 Y1:403 Y2:433
Surely this is Washizu's work.

357
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:39,899  X1:157 X2:562 Y1:403 Y2:433
Flee now and they mark us traitors.

358
00:50:40,003 --> 00:50:42,267  X1:234 X2:485 Y1:404 Y2:433
Hear my story, Prince.

359
00:50:42,472 --> 00:50:44,099  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:403 Y2:433
No justice for the dead.

360
00:50:44,207 --> 00:50:47,768  X1:285 X2:435 Y1:372 Y2:433
Let me go.
Let go of me.

361
00:50:57,654 --> 00:51:01,522  X1:214 X2:506 Y1:371 Y2:433
Do not heed the minions.
Noriyasu is our only foe.

362
00:51:02,292 --> 00:51:05,193  X1:239 X2:478 Y1:371 Y2:433
- Where's Noriyasu?
- He was nearly ours.

363
00:51:05,295 --> 00:51:07,855  X1:265 X2:453 Y1:403 Y2:433
So he's escaped.

364
00:51:08,065 --> 00:51:10,966  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:371 Y2:433
He fled to the castle
with the prince.

365
00:51:11,334 --> 00:51:13,928  X1:248 X2:470 Y1:371 Y2:433
What, to the castle
with the prince?

366
00:51:14,137 --> 00:51:16,970  X1:195 X2:526 Y1:371 Y2:433
My God. Spider's Web Castle
is in Miki's charge.

367
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:18,801  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:427
If he admits those two...

368
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,944  X1:191 X2:526 Y1:371 Y2:427
Admitting those foul traitors
insults our Great Lord.

369
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:24,372  X1:279 X2:441 Y1:403 Y2:427
Press forward.

370
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,830  X1:294 X2:423 Y1:403 Y2:427
Give chase.

371
00:51:56,313 --> 00:51:58,508  X1:251 X2:468 Y1:403 Y2:433
Ready your arrows.

372
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:17,857  X1:289 X2:431 Y1:403 Y2:427
Damn them.

373
00:53:25,268 --> 00:53:26,428  X1:243 X2:473 Y1:403 Y2:427
Word for Lord Miki.

374
00:53:27,604 --> 00:53:31,199  X1:185 X2:532 Y1:371 Y2:433
As he prepared to attack Inui,
our Great Lord died tragically,

375
00:53:31,408 --> 00:53:34,900  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:371 Y2:427
in the Garrison
at Washizu's treasonous hand.

376
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,502  X1:176 X2:544 Y1:403 Y2:433
I, Noriyasu, fought my way back

377
00:53:37,614 --> 00:53:41,710  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:371 Y2:433
to this castle with the prince
under my protection.

378
00:53:42,719 --> 00:53:44,448  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates in haste.

379
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,820  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates.

380
00:53:48,191 --> 00:53:49,249  X1:302 X2:418 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord Miki.

381
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:51,122  X1:195 X2:521 Y1:403 Y2:433
Washizu swiftly approaches.

382
00:53:52,195 --> 00:53:54,186  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates.

383
00:53:55,365 --> 00:53:58,562  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates.

384
00:54:18,054 --> 00:54:19,578  X1:245 X2:476 Y1:403 Y2:433
Miki, how dare you?

385
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:21,256  X1:321 X2:399 Y1:404 Y2:427
Prince.

386
00:54:40,010 --> 00:54:41,477  X1:254 X2:463 Y1:403 Y2:430
Strike them, Lord.

387
00:54:42,746 --> 00:54:43,906  X1:299 X2:420 Y1:403 Y2:427
Hold back.

388
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:48,580  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:403 Y2:430
Give chase and strike them, Lord.

389
00:54:50,854 --> 00:54:52,583  X1:277 X2:442 Y1:403 Y2:430
No, hold back.

390
00:55:00,297 --> 00:55:03,562  X1:178 X2:540 Y1:372 Y2:433
We cannot move
until we perceive Miki's design.

391
00:55:03,867 --> 00:55:05,494  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:403 Y2:433
With our Great Lord gone,

392
00:55:05,702 --> 00:55:08,262  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:403 Y2:433
Miki may plan to usurp the throne,

393
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:12,100  X1:190 X2:526 Y1:371 Y2:433
and then Miki himself
will become our next enemy.

394
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,021  X1:323 X2:382 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord.

395
00:55:32,729 --> 00:55:33,696  X1:331 X2:389 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord.

396
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:35,762  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:403 Y2:433
A message from your lady.

397
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,158  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is it?

398
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:39,667  X1:170 X2:548 Y1:403 Y2:433
If Miki refuses to open the gates,

399
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:43,032  X1:200 X2:518 Y1:371 Y2:427
approach the gates bearing
the Great Lord's coffin.

400
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:44,831  X1:330 X2:388 Y1:404 Y2:427
I see.

401
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:05,795  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates.

402
00:56:06,529 --> 00:56:08,622  X1:222 X2:495 Y1:403 Y2:427
The Great Lord returns.

403
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,732  X1:267 X2:451 Y1:403 Y2:433
Open the gates.

404
00:56:13,269 --> 00:56:18,070  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:371 Y2:433
Washizu will enter,
guarding the Great Lord's coffin.

405
01:00:44,207 --> 01:00:47,301  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:403 Y2:433
What of the Great Lord's lady?

406
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,737  X1:232 X2:485 Y1:403 Y2:427
She has taken her life.

407
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:56,615  X1:196 X2:522 Y1:371 Y2:433
She could not bear to see
an enemy occupy the castle.

408
01:01:50,239 --> 01:01:55,006  X1:141 X2:578 Y1:371 Y2:427
Surely the evil spirit of Spider's Forest
foretold the truth.

409
01:01:57,213 --> 01:02:02,412  X1:128 X2:590 Y1:371 Y2:433
With the Great Lord gone,
Inui will surely turn against this fortress.

410
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:05,313  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:403 Y2:433
They will come in force.

411
01:02:05,588 --> 01:02:10,252  X1:195 X2:522 Y1:371 Y2:427
You alone have the strength
to defend this castle.

412
01:02:10,927 --> 01:02:15,990  X1:193 X2:525 Y1:371 Y2:427
I will argue the justice of this
before the Council.

413
01:02:36,886 --> 01:02:39,946  X1:246 X2:472 Y1:371 Y2:433
We shall speak of it
at greater length.

414
01:03:15,758 --> 01:03:17,658  X1:215 X2:503 Y1:403 Y2:427
Where lies the Garrison?

415
01:03:19,328 --> 01:03:22,058  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:403 Y2:430
At the foot of those mountains, see?

416
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:27,069  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
From this height,
it seems almost pitiful.

417
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:32,268  X1:196 X2:524 Y1:371 Y2:430
Life can always be improved.
Fine, fine fortune.

418
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:37,105  X1:174 X2:544 Y1:371 Y2:433
If only there were an heir,
this house would have great joy.

419
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:48,886  X1:149 X2:571 Y1:403 Y2:433
So I cannot persuade you of the folly

420
01:03:49,091 --> 01:03:53,425  X1:158 X2:560 Y1:371 Y2:427
in naming Miki's son
as heir to the throne of this castle?

421
01:03:55,231 --> 01:03:57,392  X1:219 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:433
At the Council meeting,

422
01:03:57,600 --> 01:04:00,535  X1:227 X2:492 Y1:371 Y2:433
he ardently argued
my right to succession.

423
01:04:01,704 --> 01:04:05,538  X1:197 X2:521 Y1:372 Y2:433
I owe my position
to his unflagging friendship.

424
01:04:06,075 --> 01:04:08,134  X1:225 X2:494 Y1:403 Y2:433
I must repay his loyalty.

425
01:04:08,344 --> 01:04:11,074  X1:273 X2:445 Y1:404 Y2:433
I cannot agree.

426
01:04:11,280 --> 01:04:16,047  X1:212 X2:507 Y1:371 Y2:433
Miki did not promote you
out of friendship.

427
01:04:16,419 --> 01:04:20,185  X1:187 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Surely you know this yourself.

428
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:22,824  X1:255 X2:464 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do not speak of it.

429
01:04:23,893 --> 01:04:25,724  X1:249 X2:471 Y1:403 Y2:433
Miki is courageous.

430
01:04:25,928 --> 01:04:28,055  X1:219 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:433
He's a shrewd strategist.

431
01:04:28,564 --> 01:04:32,830  X1:224 X2:492 Y1:371 Y2:433
Terrifying as an enemy,
but a trustworthy ally.

432
01:04:33,970 --> 01:04:36,734  X1:171 X2:547 Y1:403 Y2:433
If I appoint his son to be my heir,

433
01:04:36,939 --> 01:04:40,204  X1:206 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:433
he will engage in any labor
on my behalf.

434
01:04:42,144 --> 01:04:43,509  X1:305 X2:414 Y1:403 Y2:427
Hear this.

435
01:04:43,713 --> 01:04:48,241  X1:146 X2:571 Y1:371 Y2:433
At tonight's banquet I will announce
and celebrate my successor.

436
01:04:49,418 --> 01:04:52,182  X1:162 X2:557 Y1:403 Y2:433
Entertain Miki and his son lavishly.

437
01:04:54,090 --> 01:04:57,958  X1:150 X2:568 Y1:403 Y2:427
I did not soil these hands with blood

438
01:04:58,728 --> 01:05:02,596  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:403 Y2:427
for the sake of Lord Miki's son.

439
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,294  X1:185 X2:534 Y1:403 Y2:433
My rule lasts but a generation.

440
01:05:10,506 --> 01:05:13,134  X1:171 X2:546 Y1:403 Y2:430
Thereafter, Miki's heirs succeed.

441
01:05:13,609 --> 01:05:16,305  X1:146 X2:572 Y1:403 Y2:433
If you believe in the Forest prophecy,

442
01:05:16,512 --> 01:05:19,242  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:371 Y2:427
it is the most we can hope for.
- I refuse.

443
01:05:19,982 --> 01:05:22,246  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:403 Y2:433
And yet, we are barren.

444
01:05:22,485 --> 01:05:25,283  X1:160 X2:558 Y1:403 Y2:433
Someday, we must choose an heir.

445
01:05:27,857 --> 01:05:29,620  X1:326 X2:393 Y1:404 Y2:427
I am...

446
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:32,722  X1:297 X2:419 Y1:403 Y2:427
with child.

447
01:05:34,430 --> 01:05:36,125  X1:291 X2:426 Y1:403 Y2:427
With child?

448
01:05:37,266 --> 01:05:38,255  X1:335 X2:382 Y1:404 Y2:427
Yes.

449
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:05,290  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:403 Y2:427
Fool.

450
01:06:07,730 --> 01:06:09,163  X1:283 X2:434 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is this?

451
01:06:10,399 --> 01:06:12,924  X1:177 X2:542 Y1:403 Y2:433
His loyal horse went mad today.

452
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:16,030  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:371 Y2:427
He bucked his bridle,
tore off his reins

453
01:06:16,138 --> 01:06:17,435  X1:309 X2:408 Y1:403 Y2:427
and fled.

454
01:06:19,742 --> 01:06:23,439  X1:204 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:427
Father, this bodes ill.
We cannot visit the Castle.

455
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:24,670  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:403 Y2:427
Ridiculous.

456
01:06:25,548 --> 01:06:29,780  X1:138 X2:580 Y1:371 Y2:433
We are honored guests
at tonight's banquet. We must attend.

457
01:06:41,931 --> 01:06:43,193  X1:320 X2:400 Y1:403 Y2:427
Father.

458
01:06:45,701 --> 01:06:47,464  X1:232 X2:484 Y1:403 Y2:433
As I have said already,

459
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:50,161  X1:179 X2:540 Y1:403 Y2:433
I am grateful for these honors...

460
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:51,465  X1:272 X2:445 Y1:403 Y2:433
You complain?

461
01:06:51,674 --> 01:06:53,699  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:433
No, I make no complaints.

462
01:06:54,744 --> 01:06:57,338  X1:248 X2:473 Y1:403 Y2:427
But I refuse to trust

463
01:06:57,546 --> 01:06:59,980  X1:220 X2:498 Y1:371 Y2:427
an evil spirit's prophecy.
Foolish.

464
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,911  X1:313 X2:408 Y1:403 Y2:427
Foolish?

465
01:07:03,085 --> 01:07:05,485  X1:169 X2:549 Y1:403 Y2:433
I saw it clearly with my own eyes.

466
01:07:06,088 --> 01:07:09,353  X1:196 X2:523 Y1:371 Y2:427
For Washizu, the prophecies
have been fulfilled.

467
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:11,685  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
For me, tonight...

468
01:07:11,894 --> 01:07:15,386  X1:228 X2:489 Y1:371 Y2:433
Such reasoning proves
you are possessed.

469
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:19,762  X1:198 X2:521 Y1:371 Y2:433
The spirit has tricked you
into fulfilling its prophecies,

470
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:24,702  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:371 Y2:427
and now you believe the prophecies
have come true. Is it wise?

471
01:07:25,474 --> 01:07:28,102  X1:224 X2:493 Y1:403 Y2:427
Then believe them not.

472
01:07:30,446 --> 01:07:31,845  X1:310 X2:407 Y1:403 Y2:433
And yet,

473
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:38,420  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:371 Y2:427
Washizu's wish to name you heir
is neither dream nor illusion.

474
01:07:38,621 --> 01:07:40,452  X1:295 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Listen well.

475
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:46,085  X1:230 X2:488 Y1:371 Y2:430
You can become lord
and master of a castle,

476
01:07:48,297 --> 01:07:51,960  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:371 Y2:433
without bloodshed,
without heaping corpse on corpse.

477
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:02,038  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:371 Y2:433
What got into that horse?
Look at my wounds.

478
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:03,268  X1:265 X2:455 Y1:403 Y2:433
Kept me behind.

479
01:08:03,479 --> 01:08:06,107  X1:165 X2:555 Y1:403 Y2:433
Made you miss out on castle sake.

480
01:08:17,259 --> 01:08:18,783  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:403 Y2:427
He's back.

481
01:09:00,536 --> 01:09:03,505  X1:212 X2:505 Y1:403 Y2:427
Where can Lord Miki be?

482
01:09:03,806 --> 01:09:05,865  X1:202 X2:515 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord is vexed as well.

483
01:09:06,075 --> 01:09:08,339  X1:179 X2:539 Y1:403 Y2:433
Such impudence is unlike Miki.

484
01:09:08,444 --> 01:09:13,609  X1:231 X2:478 Y1:371 Y2:433
Oh, terrible gods
attend our story well

485
01:09:13,816 --> 01:09:18,048  X1:202 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:433
The very same tale
foretold in ancient legend

486
01:09:18,254 --> 01:09:21,223  X1:241 X2:469 Y1:371 Y2:427
The warrior Chikata
whose devilish men

487
01:09:21,323 --> 01:09:24,690  X1:179 X2:527 Y1:403 Y2:427
served his traitorous schemes

488
01:09:25,928 --> 01:09:30,627  X1:173 X2:538 Y1:371 Y2:433
Yet when his demon henchmen
murder him in betrayal

489
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,060  X1:191 X2:520 Y1:403 Y2:433
their debt of royal treachery

490
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:40,040  X1:188 X2:517 Y1:403 Y2:433
swiftly brings their own ruin

491
01:09:40,242 --> 01:09:43,803  X1:208 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:433
And thus it came to pass

492
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:47,038  X1:220 X2:499 Y1:371 Y2:433
That's enough.
Enough of your dancing.

493
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:49,985  X1:340 X2:377 Y1:404 Y2:427
Sir.

494
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,671  X1:267 X2:453 Y1:403 Y2:433
Damn you, Miki.

495
01:11:26,282 --> 01:11:28,147  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:403 Y2:427
Such insolence.

496
01:11:32,521 --> 01:11:34,148  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
Remove yourself.

497
01:11:34,990 --> 01:11:36,116  X1:262 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
Remove yourself.

498
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,426  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord.

499
01:11:41,497 --> 01:11:42,987  X1:277 X2:440 Y1:403 Y2:433
Calm yourself.

500
01:11:43,198 --> 01:11:45,792  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:433
He has imbibed too freely.

501
01:11:48,837 --> 01:11:53,934  X1:150 X2:566 Y1:371 Y2:427
Lately, he is often this way
when he has had too much to drink.

502
01:11:54,543 --> 01:11:59,981  X1:123 X2:596 Y1:371 Y2:427
No doubt his predecessor's violent death
tears at his heart.

503
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,035  X1:255 X2:463 Y1:403 Y2:433
I'm terribly drunk.

504
01:12:32,247 --> 01:12:32,872  X1:271 X2:447 Y1:403 Y2:433
What's wrong?

505
01:12:36,352 --> 01:12:38,980  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:403 Y2:433
Will you men not take a drop?

506
01:12:39,922 --> 01:12:40,684  X1:272 X2:447 Y1:403 Y2:427
Let's celebrate.

507
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:06,444  X1:226 X2:491 Y1:371 Y2:433
What can be the cause
of Miki's delay?

508
01:13:10,819 --> 01:13:14,482  X1:235 X2:484 Y1:371 Y2:433
Rumor has it that Inui
has spies afoot.

509
01:13:15,824 --> 01:13:18,019  X1:269 X2:449 Y1:403 Y2:433
I pray all is well.

510
01:13:37,946 --> 01:13:39,538  X1:257 X2:460 Y1:403 Y2:433
There he is again.

511
01:13:59,234 --> 01:14:03,432  X1:199 X2:519 Y1:371 Y2:433
If you reprove me so,
draw your sword and strike.

512
01:14:06,108 --> 01:14:08,076  X1:239 X2:480 Y1:403 Y2:433
I'll slay you yet again.

513
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:20,244  X1:310 X2:410 Y1:403 Y2:433
My Lord.

514
01:14:21,623 --> 01:14:23,250  X1:261 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
Pay him no mind.

515
01:14:23,725 --> 01:14:26,922  X1:212 X2:509 Y1:371 Y2:433
His confusion will subside
with the liquor.

516
01:14:27,129 --> 01:14:30,292  X1:227 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
Forgive this unseemly
disruption of our feast.

517
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,933  X1:209 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:433
Please retire for the night.

518
01:14:57,025 --> 01:14:58,492  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:404 Y2:427
Retire!

519
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:29,414  X1:282 X2:437 Y1:403 Y2:427
How brilliant.

520
01:15:29,958 --> 01:15:33,587  X1:182 X2:537 Y1:371 Y2:430
A Great Lord,
his ambitions set on the world,

521
01:15:33,795 --> 01:15:37,356  X1:148 X2:570 Y1:403 Y2:433
terrorized and undone by phantoms.

522
01:15:38,066 --> 01:15:39,363  X1:281 X2:437 Y1:403 Y2:427
Who's there?

523
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:16,803  X1:222 X2:497 Y1:403 Y2:427
Lord Miki is done with...

524
01:16:24,546 --> 01:16:25,274  X1:313 X2:406 Y1:403 Y2:433
Enough!

525
01:16:28,116 --> 01:16:29,743  X1:322 X2:397 Y1:404 Y2:427
Retire.

526
01:16:31,420 --> 01:16:33,149  X1:274 X2:445 Y1:403 Y2:433
My Great Lord.

527
01:16:33,255 --> 01:16:36,918  X1:159 X2:557 Y1:403 Y2:433
There is a more pressing question.

528
01:16:40,429 --> 01:16:41,453  X1:313 X2:408 Y1:404 Y2:427
His son?

529
01:16:43,932 --> 01:16:48,198  X1:176 X2:543 Y1:371 Y2:433
I wounded him, but he escaped,
clinging to his steed.

530
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:50,371  X1:244 X2:474 Y1:403 Y2:433
What? He escaped?

531
01:16:51,273 --> 01:16:53,298  X1:262 X2:457 Y1:403 Y2:427
I have no excuse.

532
01:18:24,700 --> 01:18:26,429  X1:241 X2:475 Y1:403 Y2:427
A fierce wind blows.

533
01:18:26,702 --> 01:18:29,603  X1:221 X2:496 Y1:371 Y2:427
As if to shake the castle
to its foundation.

534
01:18:31,139 --> 01:18:32,868  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:403 Y2:427
These foundations

535
01:18:33,075 --> 01:18:36,602  X1:208 X2:508 Y1:371 Y2:427
already tremble,
without need of the wind.

536
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:40,812  X1:194 X2:526 Y1:371 Y2:430
Nowadays, even the garrison
and fortress commanders,

537
01:18:41,016 --> 01:18:44,816  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:433
who once paid court here daily,
are hardly seen.

538
01:18:45,020 --> 01:18:47,454  X1:239 X2:481 Y1:403 Y2:433
Let sleeping dogs lie.

539
01:18:47,656 --> 01:18:49,055  X1:251 X2:466 Y1:403 Y2:430
Two commanders,

540
01:18:49,257 --> 01:18:53,057  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:371 Y2:427
whom the Great Lord doubted,
forced to take their lives.

541
01:18:53,261 --> 01:18:58,130  X1:170 X2:550 Y1:371 Y2:427
Hard to believe it was Inui's spies
that murdered Miki.

542
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:00,995  X1:281 X2:436 Y1:403 Y2:427
I've heard tell

543
01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:06,641  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:427
that Miki's son
has taken shelter with Inui.

544
01:19:06,908 --> 01:19:10,344  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:371 Y2:427
Only a fool would side
with his father's foe.

545
01:19:10,545 --> 01:19:13,708  X1:223 X2:493 Y1:371 Y2:433
They say even Noriyasu
and our last prince

546
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:16,884  X1:170 X2:549 Y1:403 Y2:433
have pledged themselves to Inui.

547
01:19:17,185 --> 01:19:19,483  X1:222 X2:496 Y1:403 Y2:427
What will come of this?

548
01:19:19,955 --> 01:19:25,188  X1:160 X2:559 Y1:371 Y2:433
In any case, we can no longer trust
this castle's invincibility.

549
01:19:26,061 --> 01:19:28,529  X1:231 X2:489 Y1:371 Y2:433
I heard a guard
of the watchtower say

550
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:33,224  X1:205 X2:512 Y1:371 Y2:433
he saw a pack of rats
fleeing the castle grounds.

551
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,165  X1:265 X2:452 Y1:403 Y2:433
They always say,

552
01:19:36,371 --> 01:19:41,604  X1:159 X2:558 Y1:403 Y2:427
"Rats flee a house before it burns."

553
01:19:59,995 --> 01:20:01,622  X1:293 X2:428 Y1:403 Y2:427
How is she?

554
01:20:02,230 --> 01:20:03,595  X1:313 X2:406 Y1:403 Y2:433
My lady,

555
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:06,029  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:403 Y2:427
how does she fare?

556
01:20:08,236 --> 01:20:09,100  X1:321 X2:397 Y1:403 Y2:433
Speak.

557
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,265  X1:245 X2:473 Y1:403 Y2:433
Why are you silent?

558
01:20:13,742 --> 01:20:18,372  X1:193 X2:523 Y1:403 Y2:433
There is nothing to speak of.

559
01:20:20,182 --> 01:20:23,640  X1:225 X2:495 Y1:371 Y2:427
My lady has given birth.
The child was stillborn.

560
01:20:23,852 --> 01:20:26,150  X1:303 X2:416 Y1:403 Y2:427
Stillborn?

561
01:20:27,489 --> 01:20:33,155  X1:202 X2:514 Y1:371 Y2:433
And lifeless first some days
within my lady's womb,

562
01:20:33,361 --> 01:20:38,594  X1:159 X2:560 Y1:403 Y2:433
my lady's health is far from certain.

563
01:20:45,473 --> 01:20:46,531  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord.

564
01:21:06,494 --> 01:21:07,791  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord.

565
01:21:47,002 --> 01:21:48,629  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:403 Y2:427
Fool!

566
01:21:53,675 --> 01:21:55,404  X1:332 X2:387 Y1:403 Y2:427
Fool.

567
01:22:21,770 --> 01:22:23,704  X1:288 X2:417 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord.

568
01:22:29,344 --> 01:22:31,107  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Great Lord.

569
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:35,543  X1:146 X2:570 Y1:403 Y2:433
A messenger from the First Fortress.

570
01:22:35,750 --> 01:22:36,944  X1:320 X2:398 Y1:403 Y2:427
What?

571
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,089  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is it?

572
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:49,059  X1:175 X2:543 Y1:371 Y2:433
Inui's men swarmed our border,
taking the First Fortress.

573
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:53,958  X1:109 X2:608 Y1:371 Y2:433
Noriyasu leads the vanguard,
swearing vengeance for the prince's father.

574
01:22:56,071 --> 01:22:59,006  X1:154 X2:563 Y1:403 Y2:427
The Second Fortress is surrounded.

575
01:22:59,207 --> 01:23:01,266  X1:199 X2:521 Y1:403 Y2:427
Miki's son commands them.

576
01:23:05,380 --> 01:23:08,474  X1:201 X2:518 Y1:371 Y2:430
First and Second Fortresses
are both lost,

577
01:23:08,683 --> 01:23:10,514  X1:217 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:433
our foe has joined forces

578
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,176  X1:157 X2:560 Y1:403 Y2:433
and approaches the Third Fortress.

579
01:23:49,491 --> 01:23:50,458  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:403 Y2:427
Cowards.

580
01:23:50,992 --> 01:23:56,294  X1:151 X2:567 Y1:371 Y2:433
It is two hours since I called council.
How can we greet this attack?

581
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:14,743  X1:260 X2:459 Y1:403 Y2:433
Enough with you.

582
01:24:14,949 --> 01:24:19,750  X1:143 X2:574 Y1:371 Y2:433
What need for the advice of cowards,
who quake and pale under fire?

583
01:24:37,038 --> 01:24:39,506  X1:270 X2:449 Y1:371 Y2:433
Bring my horse.
My horse.

584
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:52,279  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:403 Y2:427
Come forth.

585
01:24:52,821 --> 01:24:54,755  X1:305 X2:415 Y1:403 Y2:433
Evil spirit.

586
01:24:55,623 --> 01:24:58,091  X1:305 X2:415 Y1:403 Y2:433
Evil spirit.

587
01:25:03,565 --> 01:25:06,227  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:403 Y2:433
Come forth, evil spirit.

588
01:25:17,679 --> 01:25:20,307  X1:231 X2:487 Y1:403 Y2:433
Come forth, evil spirit.

589
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:21,812  X1:290 X2:428 Y1:403 Y2:427
Come forth.

590
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,518  X1:275 X2:443 Y1:371 Y2:427
Show yourself.
I must know.

591
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,685  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:403 Y2:427
Whom have we here?

592
01:26:01,456 --> 01:26:06,018  X1:215 X2:504 Y1:371 Y2:433
Is this not the Great Lord
of Spider's Web Castle?

593
01:26:06,995 --> 01:26:09,828  X1:186 X2:533 Y1:403 Y2:433
Damn you. Answer me plainly.

594
01:26:10,031 --> 01:26:13,558  X1:190 X2:528 Y1:371 Y2:433
Is it true Miki's son
will be Lord of Spider's Web?

595
01:26:14,235 --> 01:26:16,795  X1:312 X2:406 Y1:404 Y2:430
So I see,

596
01:26:18,206 --> 01:26:23,269  X1:182 X2:536 Y1:371 Y2:433
you have finally come
to the end of your wanderings.

597
01:26:24,913 --> 01:26:27,473  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:403 Y2:427
You have done well.

598
01:26:29,050 --> 01:26:30,915  X1:243 X2:474 Y1:403 Y2:427
You have done well.

599
01:26:31,819 --> 01:26:33,480  X1:250 X2:470 Y1:403 Y2:433
Damn you. Tell me.

600
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:37,351  X1:163 X2:555 Y1:371 Y2:433
If you have the power,
foretell the outcome of my battle.

601
01:26:46,768 --> 01:26:50,534  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:403 Y2:433
You may set your fears to rest.

602
01:26:52,340 --> 01:26:57,243  X1:228 X2:491 Y1:371 Y2:433
Until the very trees
of Spider's Web Forest

603
01:26:58,446 --> 01:27:03,884  X1:173 X2:546 Y1:403 Y2:433
rise against Spider's Web Castle,

604
01:27:04,085 --> 01:27:10,422  X1:164 X2:553 Y1:403 Y2:433
you will not be defeated in battle.

605
01:27:13,461 --> 01:27:16,897  X1:218 X2:499 Y1:403 Y2:427
The trees rise to attack?

606
01:27:19,934 --> 01:27:22,402  X1:206 X2:511 Y1:403 Y2:433
Such a thing is impossible.

607
01:27:25,607 --> 01:27:28,804  X1:180 X2:540 Y1:371 Y2:427
Which means,
I will not be defeated in battle?

608
01:27:33,581 --> 01:27:37,244  X1:150 X2:569 Y1:403 Y2:433
If you choose the path of bloodshed,

609
01:27:38,286 --> 01:27:43,383  X1:219 X2:498 Y1:371 Y2:433
then climb to
the very pinnacle of evil.

610
01:27:44,459 --> 01:27:49,362  X1:243 X2:477 Y1:371 Y2:430
Noriyasu, the prince
and even Miki's son,

611
01:27:49,564 --> 01:27:51,623  X1:208 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:427
I swear I shall kill them all.

612
01:27:55,570 --> 01:27:58,971  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
If you choose to build
a mountain of corpses,

613
01:27:59,173 --> 01:28:03,109  X1:247 X2:471 Y1:371 Y2:433
build its summit
as high as you dare.

614
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:10,281  X1:164 X2:555 Y1:371 Y2:427
I'll lay a fresh mountain of corpses
over these bleached bones.

615
01:28:14,255 --> 01:28:17,224  X1:202 X2:517 Y1:403 Y2:433
If you will make blood flow,

616
01:28:17,425 --> 01:28:20,952  X1:233 X2:486 Y1:371 Y2:430
let it be a river,
no, an ocean of blood.

617
01:28:21,663 --> 01:28:26,259  X1:194 X2:522 Y1:371 Y2:427
A deluge of blood shall stain
these woods crimson.

618
01:28:29,971 --> 01:28:31,768  X1:223 X2:495 Y1:403 Y2:433
Come for me, Noriyasu.

619
01:28:31,973 --> 01:28:33,565  X1:229 X2:487 Y1:403 Y2:433
Ally yourself with Inui,

620
01:28:33,775 --> 01:28:35,800  X1:178 X2:539 Y1:403 Y2:433
with the prince, and Miki's son.

621
01:28:36,010 --> 01:28:39,343  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:371 Y2:430
Join forces with the First
and Second Fortress, too.

622
01:28:39,781 --> 01:28:41,681  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:403 Y2:430
Thousands, tens of thousands.

623
01:28:42,050 --> 01:28:46,043  X1:187 X2:531 Y1:371 Y2:433
Bring every man you can find
and lay siege to Spider's Web!

624
01:29:36,604 --> 01:29:37,571  X1:302 X2:417 Y1:403 Y2:427
Heed this.

625
01:29:39,674 --> 01:29:42,040  X1:216 X2:501 Y1:403 Y2:433
The Spider's Web Forest

626
01:29:42,243 --> 01:29:44,677  X1:241 X2:477 Y1:403 Y2:427
is but a web of trails.

627
01:29:47,448 --> 01:29:50,679  X1:171 X2:548 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do not let the paths beguile you.

628
01:29:50,885 --> 01:29:52,477  X1:267 X2:450 Y1:403 Y2:427
Avoid the trails.

629
01:29:52,687 --> 01:29:57,090  X1:180 X2:539 Y1:371 Y2:433
Once inside the forest,
ride straight through the trees,

630
01:29:57,291 --> 01:29:59,259  X1:225 X2:493 Y1:403 Y2:433
and press only forward.

631
01:30:48,743 --> 01:30:52,702  X1:188 X2:532 Y1:371 Y2:427
What? My hidden troops
in the forest have withdrawn?

632
01:30:54,148 --> 01:30:55,240  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:403 Y2:427
Cowards.

633
01:30:58,252 --> 01:30:59,913  X1:218 X2:500 Y1:403 Y2:433
The men who lay in wait

634
01:31:00,121 --> 01:31:03,579  X1:165 X2:552 Y1:371 Y2:433
withdrew en masse
without receiving a single arrow?

635
01:31:03,925 --> 01:31:07,884  X1:157 X2:561 Y1:371 Y2:433
Our foe Noriyasu knows the forest.
We cannot entrap him.

636
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:23,632  X1:281 X2:438 Y1:404 Y2:427
I was remiss...

637
01:32:34,315 --> 01:32:35,282  X1:331 X2:388 Y1:404 Y2:430
Men,

638
01:32:36,684 --> 01:32:38,515  X1:282 X2:436 Y1:403 Y2:427
hear me well.

639
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:41,882  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:403 Y2:430
In battle, the final victor takes all.

640
01:32:42,390 --> 01:32:44,358  X1:208 X2:509 Y1:403 Y2:433
Skirmishes mean nothing.

641
01:32:45,560 --> 01:32:46,993  X1:293 X2:424 Y1:403 Y2:427
Take heart.

642
01:32:47,194 --> 01:32:49,253  X1:184 X2:534 Y1:403 Y2:433
I, Washizu, demand your trust.

643
01:32:49,463 --> 01:32:53,297  X1:197 X2:520 Y1:372 Y2:427
On no account
shall I meet defeat in battle.

644
01:33:03,978 --> 01:33:07,641  X1:218 X2:501 Y1:371 Y2:433
If you do not believe me,
I'll tell you why.

645
01:33:14,589 --> 01:33:19,219  X1:181 X2:537 Y1:371 Y2:427
This happened when I still
commanded the First Fortress.

646
01:33:19,794 --> 01:33:24,288  X1:176 X2:541 Y1:371 Y2:433
As I returned to the Castle
after rushing Fujimaki's mutiny,

647
01:33:25,032 --> 01:33:27,592  X1:257 X2:462 Y1:371 Y2:433
I saw an evil spirit
in Spider's Forest.

648
01:33:27,802 --> 01:33:29,963  X1:204 X2:512 Y1:403 Y2:433
According to its prophecy,

649
01:33:30,171 --> 01:33:33,231  X1:203 X2:517 Y1:371 Y2:430
I would that eve become
Lord of the North Garrison,

650
01:33:33,441 --> 01:33:35,739  X1:224 X2:494 Y1:403 Y2:430
and later, of this Castle.

651
01:33:36,210 --> 01:33:38,405  X1:271 X2:449 Y1:403 Y2:433
Behold my fate.

652
01:33:38,613 --> 01:33:42,515  X1:228 X2:488 Y1:371 Y2:433
The prophecy foretold
my destiny precisely.

653
01:33:44,852 --> 01:33:47,013  X1:262 X2:454 Y1:403 Y2:433
And then, today.

654
01:33:50,124 --> 01:33:52,786  X1:243 X2:476 Y1:371 Y2:427
I spurred my steed
back into the Forest

655
01:33:52,994 --> 01:33:56,327  X1:212 X2:506 Y1:371 Y2:433
to ask the spirit
of my fortune once more.

656
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:00,498  X1:315 X2:404 Y1:404 Y2:433
Rejoice.

657
01:34:01,068 --> 01:34:05,630  X1:147 X2:573 Y1:371 Y2:427
None may defeat me, though heaven
descends or the earth rends.

658
01:34:06,907 --> 01:34:08,932  X1:252 X2:465 Y1:403 Y2:433
The spirit told me,

659
01:34:09,143 --> 01:34:13,637  X1:204 X2:516 Y1:371 Y2:430
until the trees of the forest
rise to attack the Castle,

660
01:34:13,848 --> 01:34:16,442  X1:164 X2:554 Y1:403 Y2:427
I shall never be defeated in battle.

661
01:34:19,687 --> 01:34:20,813  X1:331 X2:388 Y1:404 Y2:427
Men.

662
01:34:21,255 --> 01:34:24,884  X1:266 X2:455 Y1:371 Y2:427
Don't tell me.
Do trees attack?

663
01:34:34,268 --> 01:34:36,532  X1:176 X2:540 Y1:403 Y2:433
Those of you who trust my fate,

664
01:34:36,637 --> 01:34:38,161  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:404 Y2:433
raise your spears.

665
01:35:11,305 --> 01:35:13,034  X1:260 X2:458 Y1:403 Y2:433
Can't see a thing.

666
01:35:30,558 --> 01:35:31,525  X1:335 X2:384 Y1:404 Y2:433
Hey.

667
01:35:32,093 --> 01:35:36,120  X1:167 X2:549 Y1:371 Y2:433
What can the enemy be plotting,
with nary a torch?

668
01:35:53,914 --> 01:35:55,779  X1:252 X2:466 Y1:403 Y2:427
What can that be?

669
01:35:59,487 --> 01:36:03,787  X1:186 X2:531 Y1:371 Y2:427
No doubt they've abandoned
their attack to build defenses.

670
01:36:25,446 --> 01:36:27,778  X1:189 X2:530 Y1:403 Y2:433
Even the formidable Noriyasu

671
01:36:28,315 --> 01:36:32,012  X1:186 X2:532 Y1:371 Y2:433
has no power against
these legendary fortifications.

672
01:36:33,354 --> 01:36:36,619  X1:184 X2:533 Y1:371 Y2:427
The attackers can see nothing
inside the castle.

673
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:39,792  X1:138 X2:579 Y1:403 Y2:433
Yet we have a bird's-eye view of them.

674
01:36:41,128 --> 01:36:43,187  X1:247 X2:472 Y1:403 Y2:433
If they do attack us,

675
01:36:43,397 --> 01:36:46,764  X1:153 X2:564 Y1:371 Y2:427
let them draw near
and then shower them with arrows.

676
01:36:59,914 --> 01:37:01,472  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is it?

677
01:37:05,653 --> 01:37:07,382  X1:244 X2:476 Y1:403 Y2:427
Is it a covert attack?

678
01:37:23,971 --> 01:37:25,336  X1:296 X2:421 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is it?

679
01:37:30,511 --> 01:37:31,842  X1:288 X2:428 Y1:403 Y2:427
An ill omen.

680
01:37:36,951 --> 01:37:40,079  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:433
Commanders of cowardice
who quake and pale.

681
01:37:41,722 --> 01:37:44,213  X1:159 X2:561 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do you not see this as good omen?

682
01:37:45,292 --> 01:37:50,059  X1:145 X2:575 Y1:371 Y2:433
How dare you let an auspicious omen
of our victory fluster you.

683
01:38:27,134 --> 01:38:28,624  X1:305 X2:399 Y1:403 Y2:433
My lady.

684
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:34,431  X1:305 X2:399 Y1:403 Y2:433
My lady.

685
01:39:44,211 --> 01:39:46,475  X1:253 X2:465 Y1:404 Y2:427
It won't come out.

686
01:39:48,349 --> 01:39:51,147  X1:207 X2:510 Y1:403 Y2:427
What an awful bloodstain.

687
01:39:57,658 --> 01:39:59,956  X1:218 X2:502 Y1:403 Y2:430
No matter how I wash it,

688
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:03,687  X1:167 X2:551 Y1:403 Y2:433
why won't this blood wash away?

689
01:40:07,835 --> 01:40:11,032  X1:204 X2:515 Y1:403 Y2:427
It reeks of blood even now.

690
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:18,534  X1:206 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:433
Why can I not clean
this blood from my hands?

691
01:40:21,782 --> 01:40:23,079  X1:327 X2:389 Y1:404 Y2:433
Asaji.

692
01:40:25,719 --> 01:40:28,517  X1:152 X2:565 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is the matter with this blood?

693
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:34,652  X1:164 X2:552 Y1:403 Y2:433
The stain will not leave my hands.

694
01:40:37,965 --> 01:40:40,092  X1:202 X2:518 Y1:403 Y2:433
No matter how many times

695
01:40:40,634 --> 01:40:42,761  X1:229 X2:490 Y1:403 Y2:433
I wash and wash again,

696
01:40:43,604 --> 01:40:47,700  X1:182 X2:535 Y1:403 Y2:427
still these hands reek of blood.

697
01:40:56,884 --> 01:40:58,442  X1:327 X2:389 Y1:404 Y2:433
Asaji.

698
01:40:58,919 --> 01:41:01,251  X1:214 X2:502 Y1:403 Y2:427
This awful stain of blood.

699
01:41:38,992 --> 01:41:39,959  X1:327 X2:393 Y1:403 Y2:427
Fools.

700
01:41:40,327 --> 01:41:43,262  X1:228 X2:490 Y1:371 Y2:433
Why this confusion
as victory approaches?

701
01:41:44,264 --> 01:41:45,322  X1:287 X2:430 Y1:403 Y2:433
Quiet down.

702
01:41:45,966 --> 01:41:47,763  X1:256 X2:461 Y1:403 Y2:433
Quiet down, I say.

703
01:41:48,135 --> 01:41:50,126  X1:233 X2:485 Y1:403 Y2:430
Great Lord. The trees,

704
01:41:50,237 --> 01:41:51,932  X1:200 X2:517 Y1:403 Y2:433
the trees of Spider's Forest.

705
01:41:52,039 --> 01:41:55,770  X1:161 X2:557 Y1:371 Y2:427
- What of them?
- The trees have risen to attack us.

706
01:41:58,278 --> 01:41:59,472  X1:297 X2:422 Y1:403 Y2:427
Ridiculous.

707
01:41:59,680 --> 01:42:03,514  X1:207 X2:513 Y1:371 Y2:427
A madman's delusion.
How would a forest move?

708
01:43:53,760 --> 01:43:55,159  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:403 Y2:427
What is this!

709
01:43:55,362 --> 01:43:57,057  X1:252 X2:468 Y1:403 Y2:433
Hold your stations.

710
01:44:09,610 --> 01:44:11,134  X1:287 X2:432 Y1:403 Y2:433
Do not yield.

711
01:44:11,245 --> 01:44:13,076  X1:224 X2:495 Y1:404 Y2:433
Return to your stations.

712
01:44:29,763 --> 01:44:30,957  X1:306 X2:412 Y1:403 Y2:427
Cowards.

713
01:44:31,164 --> 01:44:32,358  X1:291 X2:428 Y1:404 Y2:427
I see it now.

714
01:44:32,566 --> 01:44:36,366  X1:172 X2:544 Y1:371 Y2:433
You'll slay me and offer my head
when you surrender.

715
01:44:54,421 --> 01:44:55,683  X1:286 X2:430 Y1:404 Y2:427
You traitors.

716
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:59,320  X1:223 X2:496 Y1:371 Y2:433
Murdering a Great Lord
is high treason.

717
01:44:59,426 --> 01:45:02,088  X1:244 X2:475 Y1:371 Y2:427
And who killed
our last Great Lord?

718
01:47:44,758 --> 01:47:47,659  X1:203 X2:515 Y1:371 Y2:427
They know our every move
from the castle.

719
01:47:47,861 --> 01:47:49,954  X1:156 X2:561 Y1:403 Y2:433
Send the large and small carts first.

720
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:52,495  X1:162 X2:558 Y1:403 Y2:433
Hide yourselves beneath the carts.

721
01:47:53,834 --> 01:47:58,168  X1:127 X2:591 Y1:371 Y2:433
Conceal yourselves among the branches
and don't expose yourselves.

722
01:48:25,065 --> 01:48:30,628  X1:236 X2:471 Y1:403 Y2:433
Look upon the ruins

723
01:48:32,572 --> 01:48:37,441  X1:213 X2:495 Y1:403 Y2:427
Of the castle of delusion

724
01:48:39,346 --> 01:48:45,444  X1:247 X2:463 Y1:403 Y2:433
Haunted only now

725
01:48:46,186 --> 01:48:52,386  X1:146 X2:564 Y1:403 Y2:433
By the spirits of those who perished

726
01:48:53,994 --> 01:49:00,160  X1:240 X2:464 Y1:403 Y2:433
A scene of carnage

727
01:49:02,235 --> 01:49:06,001  X1:204 X2:503 Y1:403 Y2:433
Born of consuming desire

728
01:49:07,707 --> 01:49:13,509  X1:181 X2:530 Y1:371 Y2:433
Never changing
Now and throughout eternity

729
01:49:14,047 --> 01:49:19,075  X1:226 X2:492 Y1:372 Y2:427
HERE STOOD
SPIDER'S WEB CASTLE

730
01:49:34,467 --> 01:49:38,494  X1:304 X2:414 Y1:404 Y2:427
THE END
