{301}{420}I deliver perfection...|and don't brag about it! :D
{3911}{3977}{y:i}The hills are alive
{3983}{4089}{y:i}With the sound of music
{4095}{4154}{y:i}With songs they have sung
{4160}{4277}{y:i}For a thousand years
{4283}{4358}{y:i}The hills fill my heart
{4364}{4474}{y:i}With the sound of music
{4480}{4658}{y:i}My heart wants to sing|{y:i}Every song it hears
{4664}{4780}{y:i}My heart wants to beat like the wings|{y:i}Of the birds that rise
{4786}{4860}{y:i}From the lake to the trees
{4866}{4969}{y:i}My heart wants to sigh|{y:i}Like a chime that flies
{4975}{5070}{y:i}From a church on a breeze
{5076}{5160}{y:i}To laugh like a brook|{y:i}When it trips and falls
{5166}{5250}{y:i}Over stones on its way
{5256}{5349}{y:i}To sing through the night
{5355}{5448}{y:i}Like a lark who is learning to pray
{5454}{5588}{y:i}I go to the hills
{5594}{5742}{y:i}When my heart is lonely
{5748}{5840}{y:i}I know I will hear
{5846}{5954}{y:i}What I've heard before
{5960}{6073}{y:i}My heart will be blessed
{6079}{6285}{y:i}With the sound of music
{6291}{6414}{y:i}And I'll sing...
{6420}{6672}{y:i}... once more
{13398}{13517}{y:i}Hallelujah, hallelujah
{13523}{13671}{y:i}Hallelujah, hallelujah
{13691}{13739}- Reverend Mother.|- Sister Bernice.
{13745}{13828}- I simply cannot find her.|- Maria?
{13834}{13880}She's missing again.
{13886}{13944}We should've put a cowbell|around her neck.
{13950}{14023}Have you tried the barn? You know|how much she adores the animals.
{14029}{14094}I have looked everywhere.|In all of the usual places.
{14100}{14154}Sister, considering it's Maria...
{14160}{14260}...I suggest you look in someplace|unusual.
{14350}{14380}Well, Reverend Mother...
{14386}{14449}...I hope this new infraction ends|whatever doubts...
{14455}{14532}...you may still have|about Maria's future here.
{14538}{14635}I always try to keep faith|in my doubts, Sister Berthe.
{14641}{14710}After all, the wool of a black sheep|is just as warm.
{14716}{14819}We are not talking about sheep,|black or white, Sister Margaretta.
{14825}{14907}Of all the candidates for|the novitiate, Maria is the least...
{14913}{14979}Children, children.
{14985}{15089}We were speculating about|the qualifications of our postulants.
{15095}{15167}The Mistress of Novices|and the Mistress of Postulants...
{15173}{15300}...were trying to help me|by expressing opposite points of view.
{15306}{15378}Tell me, Sister Catherine,|what do you think of Maria?
{15384}{15475}She's a wonderful girl,|some of the time.
{15481}{15555}- Sister Agatha?|- It's very easy to like Maria...
{15561}{15622}...except when it's difficult.
{15628}{15713}- And you, Sister Sophia?|- Oh, I love her very dearly.
{15719}{15789}But she always seems to be|in trouble, doesn't she?
{15795}{15839}Exactly what I say.
{15845}{15903}{y:i}She climbs a tree and scrapes her knee
{15909}{15959}{y:i}Her dress has got a tear
{15965}{16075}{y:i}She waltzes on her way to Mass|{y:i}And whistles on the stair
{16081}{16189}{y:i}And underneath her wimple|{y:i}She has curlers in her hair
{16195}{16305}{y:i}I've even heard her singing|{y:i}In the abbey
{16311}{16358}{y:i}She's always late for chapel
{16364}{16420}{y:i}But her penitence is real
{16426}{16481}{y:i}She's always late for everything
{16487}{16539}{y:i}Except for every meal
{16545}{16657}{y:i}I hate to have to say it|{y:i}But I very firmly feel
{16663}{16775}{y:i}Maria's not an asset to the abbey
{16781}{16842}{y:i}I'd like to say a word in her behalf
{16848}{16895}Say it, Sister Margaretta.
{16901}{17033}{y:i}Maria makes me laugh
{17066}{17159}{y:i}How do you solve a problem like Maria?
{17165}{17257}{y:i}How do you catch a cloud|{y:i}And pin it down?
{17263}{17350}{y:i}How do you find a word|{y:i}That means Maria?
{17356}{17382}{y:i}A flibbertigibbet
{17388}{17458}{y:i}- A will-o'-the-wisp|{y:i}- A clown
{17460}{17550}{y:i}Many a thing you know|{y:i}You'd like to tell her
{17556}{17643}{y:i}Many a thing she ought to understand
{17649}{17745}{y:i}But how do you make her stay|{y:i}And listen to all you say?
{17751}{17835}{y:i}How do you keep a wave upon the sand?
{17841}{17945}{y:i}How do you solve a problem like Maria?
{17951}{18083}{y:i}How do you hold a moonbeam...
{18089}{18240}{y:i}... in your hand?
{18246}{18330}{y:i}When I'm with her I'm confused|{y:i}Out of focus and bemused
{18336}{18418}{y:i}And I never know exactly where I am
{18424}{18506}{y:i}- Unpredictable as weather|{y:i}- She's as flighty as a feather
{18512}{18555}{y:i}- She's a darling|{y:i}- She's a demon
{18561}{18597}{y:i}She's a lamb
{18603}{18690}{y:i}She'll out pester any pest|{y:i}Drive a hornet from its nest
{18696}{18782}{y:i}She can throw a whirling dervish|{y:i}Out of whirl
{18788}{18881}{y:i}- She is gentle, she is wild|{y:i}- She's a riddle, she's a child
{18887}{18948}{y:i}- She's a headache|{y:i}- She's an angel
{18954}{19060}{y:i}She's a girl
{19066}{19158}{y:i}How do you solve a problem like Maria?
{19164}{19254}{y:i}How do you catch a cloud|{y:i}And pin it down?
{19260}{19345}{y:i}How do you find a word|{y:i}That means Maria?
{19351}{19398}{y:i}- A flibbertigibbet|{y:i}- A will-o'-the-wisp
{19404}{19449}{y:i}A clown
{19455}{19545}{y:i}Many a thing you know|{y:i}You'd like to tell her
{19551}{19633}{y:i}Many a thing she ought to understand
{19639}{19744}{y:i}- But how do you make her stay|{y:i}- And listen to all you say?
{19750}{19847}{y:i}How do you keep a wave upon the sand?
{19853}{19992}{y:i}How do you solve a problem like Maria?
{20375}{20552}{y:i}How do you hold a moonbeam...
{20558}{20750}{y:i}... in your hand?
{20996}{21081}You may go in now, Maria.
{21346}{21422}Come here, my child.
{21541}{21590}Now sit down.
{21596}{21682}Reverend Mother, I'm sorry.|I couldn't help myself.
{21688}{21763}- The hills were beckoning and before...|- Dear.
{21769}{21816}I haven't summoned you for apologies.
{21822}{21885}Please let me ask for forgiveness.
{21891}{21937}If you'll feel better.
{21943}{22000}Yes, you see,|the sky was so blue today...
{22006}{22097}...and everything was so green and|fragrant, I had to be a part of it.
{22103}{22209}The Untersberg led me higher like|it wanted me to go through the clouds.
{22215}{22265}Suppose darkness had come|and you were lost?
{22271}{22325}Mother, I could never be lost|up there.
{22331}{22398}That's my mountain.|I was brought up on it.
{22404}{22445}It was the mountain that led me|to you.
{22451}{22472}Oh?
{22478}{22549}When I was a child,|I would come down and climb a tree...
{22555}{22597}...and look in your garden.
{22603}{22700}I'd see the sisters at work|and hear them sing.
{22706}{22792}Which brings me to another|transgression, Reverend Mother.
{22798}{22859}I was singing out there today.
{22865}{22961}Only in the abbey do we have rules|about postulants singing.
{22967}{23015}I can't stop wherever I am.
{23021}{23077}Worse, I can't seem to stop|saying things.
{23083}{23137}Everything I think and feel.
{23143}{23177}Some call that "honesty".
{23183}{23240}Oh, but it's terrible,|Reverend Mother!
{23246}{23342}You know how Sister Berthe makes me|kiss the floor after a disagreement?
{23348}{23469}Lately, I kiss the floor|when I see her coming to save time.
{23496}{23542}Maria...
{23548}{23620}...when you saw us over the wall|and longed to be with us...
{23626}{23765}...that didn't mean you were prepared|for the way we live here, did it?
{23771}{23828}No, Mother, but I pray and I try.
{23834}{23875}And I am learning. I really am.
{23881}{23955}What is the most important lesson|you have learned here?
{23961}{24089}To find out what is the will of God|and do it wholeheartedly.
{24120}{24177}Maria...
{24183}{24250}...it seems to be God's will|that you leave us.
{24256}{24298}- Leave?|- Only for a while.
{24304}{24360}No, Mother!|Please don't send me away!
{24366}{24478}This is where I belong. It's my home,|my family. It's my life.
{24484}{24555}- Are you truly ready for it?|- Yes, I am.
{24561}{24679}If you go out into the world for a|time, knowing what we expect of you...
{24685}{24750}...you will find out|if you can expect it of yourself.
{24756}{24896}I know what you expect, Mother,|and I can do it! I promise I can!
{24944}{25011}Yes, Mother.
{25024}{25101}If it is God's will.
{25118}{25240}There is a family near Salzburg that|needs a governess until September.
{25246}{25308}- September?|- For seven children.
{25314}{25339}Seven children?!
{25345}{25388}Do you like children?
{25394}{25459}Well, yes, but seven!
{25465}{25548}I will tell Captain von Trapp|to expect you tomorrow.
{25554}{25598}Captain?
{25604}{25720}A retired officer of the lmperial|Navy. A fine man and a brave one.
{25726}{25790}His wife died,|and he is alone with the children.
{25796}{25912}I understand he has had a difficult|time keeping a governess there.
{25918}{26000}Why difficult, Reverend Mother?
{26006}{26113}The Lord will show you|in His own good time.
{26959}{27018}When the Lord closes a door...
{27024}{27121}...somewhere He opens a window.
{27141}{27260}{y:i}What will this day be like?
{27266}{27356}{y:i}I wonder
{27475}{27588}{y:i}What will my future be?
{27594}{27685}{y:i}I wonder
{27686}{27758}{y:i}It could be so exciting
{27764}{27838}{y:i}To be out in the world|{y:i}To be free
{27844}{27940}{y:i}My heart should be wildly rejoicing
{27946}{28076}{y:i}Oh, what's the matter with me?
{28082}{28155}{y:i}I've always longed for adventure
{28161}{28247}{y:i}To do the things I've never dared
{28253}{28330}{y:i}Now here I'm facing adventure
{28336}{28520}{y:i}Then why am I so scared?
{28566}{28635}{y:i}A captain with seven children
{28641}{28746}{y:i}What's so fearsome about that?
{28770}{28832}{y:i}I must stop these doubts and worries
{28838}{28907}{y:i}If I don't I just know I'll turn back
{28913}{29008}{y:i}I must dream of the things|{y:i}I am seeking
{29014}{29151}{y:i}I am seeking the courage I lack
{29157}{29249}{y:i}The courage to serve them|{y:i}With reliance
{29255}{29325}{y:i}Face my mistakes without defiance
{29331}{29372}{y:i}Show them I'm worthy
{29378}{29442}{y:i}And while I show them
{29448}{29538}{y:i}I'll show me
{29544}{29673}{y:i}So let them bring on|{y:i}All their problems
{29679}{29757}{y:i}I'll do better than my best
{29763}{29837}{y:i}I have confidence|{y:i}They'll put me to the test
{29843}{29925}{y:i}But I'll make them see|{y:i}I have confidence in me
{29931}{30010}{y:i}Somehow I will impress them
{30016}{30094}{y:i}I will be firm but kind
{30100}{30179}{y:i}And all those children|{y:i}Heaven bless them
{30185}{30264}{y:i}They will look up to me|{y:i}And mind me
{30270}{30345}{y:i}With each step I am more certain
{30351}{30428}{y:i}Everything will turn out fine
{30434}{30508}{y:i}I have confidence|{y:i}The world can all be mine
{30514}{30683}{y:i}They'll have to agree|{y:i}I have confidence in me
{30683}{30749}{y:i}I have confidence in sunshine
{30755}{30828}{y:i}I have confidence in rain
{30834}{30904}{y:i}I have confidence|{y:i}That spring will come again
{30910}{30984}{y:i}Besides which you see|{y:i}I have confidence in me
{30990}{31065}{y:i}Strength doesn't lie in numbers
{31071}{31144}{y:i}Strength doesn't lie in wealth
{31150}{31229}{y:i}Strength lies in nights|{y:i}Of peaceful slumbers
{31235}{31305}{y:i}When you wake up, wake up|{y:i}It's healthy
{31311}{31383}{y:i}All I trust I leave my heart to
{31389}{31458}{y:i}All I trust becomes my own
{31464}{31616}{y:i}I have confidence in confidence alone
{31930}{32006}Oh, help.
{32261}{32433}{y:i}I have confidence in confidence alone
{32439}{32555}{y:i}Besides which you see|{y:i}I have confidence...
{32561}{32735}{y:i}... in me
{32796}{32872}Oh. Whoo.
{32882}{32976}Hello. Here I am.
{33006}{33088}I'm from the convent.|I'm the new governess, captain.
{33091}{33174}And I'm the old butler, frulein.
{33180}{33209}Oh.
{33215}{33296}Well, how do you do?
{33511}{33646}You'll wait here, please.
{35679}{35799}In future, remember certain rooms|in this house are not to be disturbed.
{35805}{35878}Yes, captain, sir.
{36030}{36180}- Why do you stare at me that way?|- You don't look like a sea captain.
{36186}{36270}I'm afraid you don't look|very much like a governess.
{36276}{36304}- Turn around.|- What?
{36310}{36376}Turn.
{36416}{36481}Hat off.
{36521}{36584}Put on another dress|before meeting the children.
{36590}{36629}But I don't have another.
{36635}{36704}When we enter the abbey,|our worldly clothes go to the poor.
{36710}{36739}What about this one?
{36745}{36784}The poor didn't want it.
{36790}{36815}Hm.
{36821}{36929}There wasn't time to make a new dress.|I can make clothes.
{36935}{37000}I'll see that you get some material.
{37006}{37062}Today, if possible.
{37068}{37110}- Now, frulein...|- Maria.
{37116}{37180}- I don't know how much they told you.|- Not much.
{37186}{37248}You are the twelfth governess...
{37254}{37312}...to look after my children|since their mother died.
{37318}{37371}I trust you will be an improvement|on the last one.
{37377}{37458}She stayed only two hours.
{37462}{37553}What's wrong with the children, sir?
{37559}{37665}Nothing is wrong with the children,|only the governesses.
{37671}{37805}They could not maintain discipline,|without which the house cannot be run.
{37811}{37855}Drill them in their studies.
{37861}{37945}I will not permit them to dream|away their summer holidays.
{37951}{38015}Each afternoon,|they march, breathing deeply.
{38021}{38060}Bedtime is to be strictly observed.
{38066}{38088}When do they play?
{38094}{38191}You will see to it that they conduct|themselves with the utmost decorum.
{38197}{38305}- I am placing you in command.|- Yes, sir.
{40201}{40237}Now...
{40243}{40351}...this is your new governess,|Frulein Maria.
{40354}{40403}Give your name at your signal.
{40409}{40501}Frulein, listen carefully. Learn|their signals so you can call them.
{40540}{40574}Liesl.
{40580}{40622}Friedrich.
{40628}{40665}Louisa.
{40671}{40701}Kurt.
{40707}{40732}Brigitta.
{40738}{40769}Marta.
{40922}{40991}Gretl.
{41065}{41147}Now, let's see how well you listened.
{41153}{41210}I won't need to whistle for them,|Reverend Captain.
{41216}{41298}I mean, I'll use their names.|Such lovely names.
{41304}{41380}Frulein, this is a large house.|The grounds are extensive.
{41386}{41452}And I will not have anyone shouting.
{41458}{41498}You will take this, please.|Learn to use it.
{41504}{41581}The children will help you.
{41593}{41703}Now, when I want you,|this is what you will hear.
{41709}{41768}Oh, no, sir. I'm sorry, sir!
{41774}{41810}I could never answer to a whistle.
{41816}{41879}Whistles are for animals,|not for children.
{41885}{41934}And definitely not for me.
{41940}{42017}It would be too humiliating.
{42023}{42149}Frulein, were you this much trouble|at the abbey?
{42155}{42219}Oh, much more, sir.
{42448}{42515}I don't know your signal.
{42521}{42621}You may call me "captain".
{42894}{42966}At ease.
{42996}{43033}Now that there's just us...
{43039}{43145}...would you please tell me all your|names again and how old you are.
{43151}{43259}I'm Liesl. I'm 16 years old,|and I don't need a governess.
{43265}{43376}I'm glad you told me, Liesl.|We'll just be good friends.
{43390}{43482}I'm Friedrich. I'm 14.|I'm impossible.
{43488}{43528}Really? Who told you that, Friedrich?
{43534}{43623}Frulein Josephine.|Four governesses ago.
{43629}{43701}I'm Brigitta.
{43708}{43815}You didn't tell me how old you are,|Louisa.
{43821}{43875}I'm Brigitta. She's Louisa.
{43881}{43947}She's 13 years old, and you're smart.
{43953}{44045}I'm 10, and I think your dress|is the ugliest one I ever saw.
{44051}{44113}- Brigitta, you shouldn't say that.|- Why not?
{44119}{44174}- Don't you think it's ugly?|- Of course.
{44180}{44245}But Frulein Helga's was ugliest.
{44251}{44314}I'm Kurt. I'm 11.|I'm incorrigible.
{44320}{44395}- Congratulations.|- What's "incorrigible"?
{44401}{44531}I think it means you want|to be treated like a boy.
{44546}{44625}I'm Marta, and I'm going to be|seven on Tuesday.
{44631}{44687}I'd like a pink parasol.
{44693}{44767}Pink's my favorite color too.
{44786}{44830}Yes, you're Gretl.
{44836}{44882}And you're five years old?
{44888}{44973}My, you're practically a lady.
{44996}{45097}I have to tell you a secret.|I've never been a governess.
{45103}{45170}You don't know anything|about being a governess?
{45176}{45225}Nothing. I'll need lots of advice.
{45231}{45340}The best way to start is to tell|Father to mind his own business.
{45346}{45388}Never come to dinner on time.
{45394}{45460}Never eat your soup quietly.
{45466}{45515}During dessert, always blow your nose.
{45521}{45587}Don't you believe a word they say,|Frulein Maria.
{45593}{45687}- Oh, why not?|- Because I like you.
{45693}{45740}Children, outside for your walk.
{45746}{45790}Father's orders. Hurry up.
{45796}{45827}Quick, quick, quick.
{45833}{45910}Frulein Maria, I'm Frau Schmidt,|the housekeeper.
{45916}{45940}How do you do.
{45946}{46051}I'll show you to your room.|Follow me.
{46281}{46360}Poor little dears.
{46628}{46769}You're very lucky. With|Frulein Helga it was a snake.
{47066}{47125}Good evening.
{47131}{47216}- Good evening, children.|- Good evening, Frulein Maria.
{47389}{47428}Enchanting little ritual.
{47434}{47522}Something you learned at the abbey?
{47528}{47620}No.
{47623}{47691}Rheumatism.
{47888}{48001}Excuse me, captain. Haven't we|forgotten to thank the Lord?
{48161}{48240}For what we receive,|may the Lord make us truly thankful.
{48246}{48329}- Amen.|Amen.
{48401}{48446}I'd like to thank you all...
{48452}{48561}...for the precious gift|you left in my pocket today.
{48607}{48688}What gift?
{48726}{48777}It's a secret between|the children and me.
{48783}{48874}Then I suggest you keep it,|and let us eat.
{48880}{48927}Knowing how nervous|I must have been...
{48933}{48990}...a stranger in a new household...
{48996}{49070}...knowing how important it was|for me to feel accepted...
{49076}{49176}...it was so kind and thoughtful of|you to make my first moments here...
{49182}{49235}...so warm and happy...
{49241}{49320}...and pleasant.
{49505}{49591}- What is the matter, Marta?|- Nothing.
{49851}{49876}Frulein...
{49882}{49973}...is it to be at every meal|or merely at dinnertime...
{49979}{50088}...that you intend leading us through|this rare and wonderful new world...
{50094}{50171}...of indigestion?
{50171}{50276}They're all right, captain.|They're just happy.
{50689}{50754}- Rolf, good evening.|- Good evening, Franz.
{50760}{50825}- I trust everything is under control?|- Yes, yes.
{50831}{50858}Good.
{50864}{50922}- Are there any developments?|- Perhaps.
{50928}{50980}- Is the captain home?|- He's at dinner.
{50986}{51042}- With the family?|- Yes.
{51048}{51103}Give him this telegram at once.
{51109}{51171}Certainly.
{51414}{51493}A telegram for you, sir.
{51524}{51569}Franz? Who delivered it?
{51575}{51661}That young lad Rolf, of course.
{51680}{51739}- Father, may I be excused?|Hm.
{51745}{51853}Children, in the morning I shall|be going to Vienna.
{51859}{51955}Not again, Father!
{52011}{52070}How long will you be gone this time?
{52076}{52110}I'm not sure, Gretl.
{52116}{52219}- To visit Baroness Schraeder again?|- Mind your own business!
{52225}{52308}As a matter of fact, yes, Louisa.
{52314}{52406}- Why can't we ever see the baroness?|Why would she want to see you?
{52412}{52529}You are going to see the baroness.|I'm bringing her back with me to visit.
{52535}{52560}Good.
{52566}{52608}And Uncle Max.
{52614}{52710}Uncle Max!
{53058}{53126}Rolf!
{53163}{53225}Oh, Rolf!
{53250}{53320}- No, Liesl. We mustn't!|- Why not, silly?
{53326}{53389}- I don't know...|- Isn't this why you're waiting?
{53395}{53439}Yes, of course.
{53445}{53512}- I've missed you, Liesl.|- You have? How much?
{53518}{53610}I even thought of sending a telegram,|so I'd be able to deliver it here.
{53616}{53709}Oh, that's a lovely thought!|Why don't you, right now?
{53715}{53815}- But I'm here!|- Please, Rolf. Send me a telegram.
{53821}{53914}I'll start it for you.|"Dear Liesl..."
{53920}{54006}"Dear Liesl: I'd like to be able|to tell you...
{54012}{54065}...how I feel about you. Stop."
{54071}{54179}"Unfortunately, this wire|is already too expensive."
{54185}{54218}"Sincerely, Rolf."
{54224}{54289}- "Sincerely"?|- Cordially.
{54295}{54374}- "Cordially"?|- Affectionately?
{54380}{54409}Mmm.
{54415}{54489}Will there be any reply?
{54495}{54565}"Dear Rolf: Stop."
{54571}{54683}"Don't stop! Your Liesl."
{54686}{54779}If only we didn't have to wait|for someone to send Father a telegram.
{54785}{54858}How do I know when I'll see you again?
{54864}{54931}Well, let's see...
{54966}{55030}I could come here by mistake.
{55036}{55164}With a telegram for Colonel Schneider!|He's here from Berlin staying with...
{55170}{55249}No one knows he's here.|Don't tell your father.
{55255}{55330}- Why not?|- Your father's so Austrian.
{55336}{55366}We're all Austrian.
{55372}{55477}Some think we ought to be German, and|they're very mad at those who don't.
{55483}{55563}They're getting ready to...
{55566}{55624}Let's hope your father|doesn't get into trouble.
{55630}{55748}Don't worry. He's a big naval hero.|He was even decorated by the emperor.
{55754}{55839}I don't worry about him.|I worry about his daughter.
{55845}{55880}Me? Why?
{55886}{55928}- Well, you're so...|- What?
{55934}{55975}You're such a baby!
{55981}{56088}I'm 16.|What's such a baby about that?
{56105}{56189}{y:i}You wait, little girl|{y:i}On an empty stage
{56195}{56285}{y:i}For fate to turn the light on
{56291}{56369}{y:i}Your life, little girl|{y:i}Is an empty page
{56375}{56484}{y:i}That men will want to write on
{56490}{56638}{y:i}To write on
{56644}{56737}{y:i}You are 16 going on 17
{56743}{56833}{y:i}Baby, it's time to think
{56839}{56927}{y:i}Better beware|{y:i}Be canny and careful
{56933}{57022}{y:i}Baby, you're on the brink
{57028}{57119}{y:i}You are 16 going on 17
{57125}{57214}{y:i}Fellows will fall in line
{57220}{57299}{y:i}Eager young lads|{y:i}And rous and cads
{57305}{57399}{y:i}Will offer you food and wine
{57405}{57500}{y:i}Totally unprepared are you
{57506}{57599}{y:i}To face a world of men
{57605}{57705}{y:i}Timid and shy and scared are you
{57711}{57795}{y:i}Of things beyond your ken
{57801}{57893}{y:i}You need someone older and wiser
{57899}{57992}{y:i}Telling you what to do
{57998}{58080}{y:i}I am 17 going on 18
{58086}{58266}{y:i}I'll take care of you
{59008}{59088}{y:i}I am 16 going on 17
{59094}{59175}{y:i}I know that I'm naive
{59181}{59258}{y:i}Fellows I meet|{y:i}May tell me I'm sweet
{59264}{59358}{y:i}And willingly I believe
{59364}{59440}{y:i}I am 16 going on 17
{59446}{59535}{y:i}Innocent as a rose
{59541}{59624}{y:i}Bachelor dandies|{y:i}Drinkers of brandies
{59630}{59710}{y:i}What do I know of those?
{59716}{59800}{y:i}Totally unprepared am I
{59806}{59895}{y:i}To face a world of men
{59901}{59980}{y:i}Timid and shy and scared am I
{59986}{60080}{y:i}Of things beyond my ken
{60086}{60172}{y:i}I need someone older and wiser
{60178}{60260}{y:i}Telling me what to do
{60266}{60353}{y:i}You are 17 going on 18
{60359}{60532}{y:i}I'll depend on you
{62936}{63022}Whee!
{63206}{63258}Come in.
{63264}{63341}Frau Schmidt.
{63359}{63402}For your new dresses.
{63408}{63505}- The captain had these sent from town.|- Oh, how lovely!
{63511}{63594}These will make the prettiest|clothes I've ever had.
{63600}{63684}Do you think he would|get me more material if I asked?
{63690}{63777}- How many dresses do you need?|- Not for me, for the children.
{63783}{63832}I want to make them some play clothes.
{63838}{63929}The von Trapp children don't play.|They march.
{63935}{64012}Surely you don't approve of that.
{64018}{64075}Ever since the captain|lost his poor wife...
{64081}{64160}...he runs this house as if on|one of his ships.
{64166}{64199}Whistles, orders.
{64205}{64250}No more music, no more laughing.
{64256}{64347}Nothing that reminds him of her.|Even the children.
{64353}{64393}But that's so wrong.
{64399}{64435}Oh, well.
{64441}{64529}How do you like your room?|There'll be new drapes at the windows.
{64535}{64565}Bu these are fine.
{64571}{64609}New ones have been ordered.
{64615}{64695}- But I really don't need them.|- Good night, now.
{64701}{64798}Frau Schmidt, if I asked|the captain about the material...?
{64804}{64919}- He's leaving in the morning.|- Of course. How long will he be gone?
{64925}{65057}It depends. The last time he visited|the baroness, he stayed for a month.
{65063}{65173}I shouldn't be saying this to you.|I don't know you that well.
{65179}{65248}But if you ask me,|the captain's thinking seriously...
{65254}{65307}...of marrying her before|summer's over.
{65313}{65420}Wonderful! The children will|have a mother again.
{65426}{65457}Yes.
{65463}{65504}Well, good night.
{65510}{65581}Good night.
{65985}{66053}Dear Father, now I know|why You sent me here.
{66059}{66128}To help these children|prepare for a new mother.
{66134}{66212}And I pray this will become|a happy family in Thy sight.
{66218}{66292}God bless the captain.|God bless Liesl and Friedrich.
{66298}{66399}God bless Louisa, Brigitta,|Marta and little Gretl.
{66405}{66510}And I forgot the other boy.|What's his name?
{66514}{66557}Well, God bless what's-his-name.
{66563}{66660}God bless the Reverend Mother|and Sister Margaretta...
{66666}{66707}...and everybody at the abbey.
{66713}{66779}And now, dear God, about Liesl.
{66785}{66829}Help her know that I'm her friend...
{66835}{66908}...and help her tell me|what she's been up to.
{66914}{66943}- Are you going to tell on me?|- Shh.
{66949}{67031}Help me to be understanding|so I may guide her footsteps.
{67037}{67100}In the name of the Father,|the Son and the Holy Ghost.
{67106}{67178}I was out walking|and somebody locked the doors early.
{67184}{67309}I didn't want to wake everybody,|so when I saw your window open...
{67310}{67397}You're not going to tell Father,|are you?
{67403}{67471}Hm.
{67530}{67567}How did you climb up?
{67573}{67647}It's how we always got in|to play tricks on the governess.
{67653}{67743}Louisa can make it with|a whole jar of spiders in her hand.
{67749}{67807}Spiders?
{67813}{67872}Oh. Liesl.
{67878}{67978}Were you out walking all by yourself?
{68120}{68219}If we wash that dress tonight,|nobody would notice it tomorrow.
{68225}{68305}You could put this on.
{68309}{68373}Take your dress and put it|to soak in the bathtub.
{68379}{68489}Come back here and sit on the bed,|and we'll have a talk.
{68495}{68567}I told you today|I didn't need a governess.
{68573}{68660}Well, maybe I do.
{69354}{69413}Gretl, are you scared?
{69499}{69553}You're not frightened|of a storm, are you?
{69559}{69636}You just stay right here with me.
{69642}{69780}- Where are the others?|- They're asleep. They're not scared.
{69849}{69930}Oh, no? Look.
{69930}{69977}All right, up here on the bed.
{69983}{70069}- Really?|- Well, just this once. Come on.
{70075}{70216}- Now we'll wait for the boys.|- You won't see them. Boys are brave.
{70325}{70374}You weren't scared, were you?
{70380}{70478}Oh, no. We just wanted|to be sure that you weren't.
{70484}{70557}- That's very thoughtful of you.|It wasn't my idea.
{70563}{70607}It was Kurt's!
{70613}{70713}Kurt! That's the one I left out!|God bless Kurt.
{70743}{70785}Why does it do that?
{70791}{70883}The lightning talks to the thunder,|and the thunder answers.
{70889}{70949}- But lightning must be nasty.|- Not really.
{70955}{71009}Why does the thunder get so angry?
{71015}{71105}It makes me want to cry.
{71112}{71212}Whenever I'm feeling unhappy,|I just try to think of nice things.
{71218}{71274}What kind of things?
{71280}{71327}Well, let me see. Nice things...
{71333}{71383}Daffodils.
{71389}{71427}Green meadows.
{71433}{71486}Skies full of stars.
{71492}{71568}{y:i}Raindrops on roses|{y:i}and whiskers on kittens
{71574}{71648}{y:i}Bright copper kettles|{y:i}And warm woolen mittens

{72320}{72397}{y:i}Snowflakes that stay|{y:i}On my nose and eyelashes
{72403}{72477}{y:i}Silver white winters|{y:i}That melt into springs
{72483}{72563}{y:i}These are a few of my favorite things
{72569}{72608}{y:i}When the dog bites
{72614}{72655}{y:i}When the bee stings
{72661}{72715}{y:i}When I'm feeling sad
{72721}{72802}{y:i}I simply remember my favorite things
{72808}{72983}{y:i}And then I don't feel so bad
{72989}{73030}- Does it work?|- Of course.
{73036}{73094}- What do you like?|- Pussy willow!
{73100}{73153}- Christmas!|- Bunny rabbits!
{73159}{73200}Snakes!
{73206}{73257}- Chocolate icing!|- No school!
{73263}{73292}Pillow fights!

{73355}{73448}- Any presents!|Ladybugs!
{73448}{73480}A good sneeze!
{73486}{73529}Gesundheit!
{73535}{73565}See what fun it is?
{73571}{73642}{y:i}Raindrops on roses|{y:i}And whiskers on kittens
{73648}{73717}{y:i}Bright copper kettles|{y:i}And warm woolen mittens
{73723}{73795}{y:i}Brown paper packages|{y:i}Tied up with strings

{74551}{74630}{y:i}These are a few of my favorite things
{74636}{74687}{y:i}When the dog bi...
{74693}{74776}Dog bites.
{74899}{74928}Hello.
{74934}{75034}Frulein, did I not tell you that|bedtime is to be strictly observed?
{75040}{75132}The children were upset|by the storm, so I...
{75138}{75162}You did, sir.
{75168}{75294}Do you, or do you not, have difficulty|remembering such simple instructions?
{75300}{75340}Only during thunderstorms.
{75399}{75434}- Liesl?|- Yes?
{75440}{75502}I don't recall seeing you|after dinner.
{75508}{75550}Really? As a matter of fact...
{75556}{75599}Yes?
{75605}{75632}Well, I was...
{75638}{75688}What she would like to say...
{75694}{75762}...is that she and I have|been getting acquainted tonight.
{75768}{75921}It's too late to go into that. You|heard your father. Go back to bed.
{75996}{76030}Frulein...
{76036}{76153}...you have managed to remember|I'm leaving in the morning?
{76159}{76306}Is it also possible you remember the|first rule in this house is discipline?
{76309}{76374}Then I trust that before I return...
{76380}{76450}...you'll have acquired some?
{76456}{76505}Captain?
{76511}{76605}Could I talk to you about clothes|for the children for when they play?
{76611}{76677}- If I could have some material.|- You are many things.
{76683}{76733}Not the least of which is repetitious.
{76739}{76792}- But they're children!|- Yes.
{76798}{76848}And I'm their father.
{76854}{76920}Good night.
{76951}{77026}Oh.
{77466}{77642}{y:i}Girls in white dresses|{y:i}With blue satin sashes
{77881}{77965}{y:i}When the dog bites|{y:i}When the bee stings
{77971}{78030}{y:i}When I'm feeling sad
{78036}{78115}{y:i}I simply remember my favorite things
{78121}{78172}{y:i}And then I don't feel...
{78178}{78381}{y:i}... so bad
{78919}{79021}Children, over here. See!
{79071}{79141}Come on.
{79789}{79856}Ho.
{81095}{81125}Frulein Maria?
{81131}{81177}Can we do this every day?
{81183}{81263}- Don't you think you'd get tired of it?|- I suppose so.
{81269}{81298}Every other day?
{81304}{81414}I haven't had so much fun since we put|glue on Frulein Josephine's toothbrush.
{81420}{81514}I can't understand how children|as nice as you can play such tricks.
{81520}{81563}- It's easy.|- But why do it?
{81569}{81640}How else can we get|Father's attention?
{81646}{81710}Oh, I see.
{81716}{81806}We'll have to think about that one.
{81821}{81860}All right, over here.
{81866}{81899}What are we going to do?
{81905}{81952}Think of a song for the baroness.
{81958}{82005}Father doesn't like us to sing.
{82011}{82097}Perhaps we can change his mind.|Now, what songs do you know?
{82103}{82154}We don't know any songs.
{82160}{82262}- Not any?|- We don't even know how to sing.
{82266}{82317}Let's not lose time. You must learn.
{82323}{82401}But how?
{82468}{82562}{y:i}Let's start at the very beginning
{82568}{82648}{y:i}A very good place to start
{82654}{82700}{y:i}When you read you begin with
{82706}{82733}{y:i}A, B, C
{82739}{82844}{y:i}When you sing, you begin with|{y:i}Do-Re-Mi
{82850}{82889}{y:i}Do-re-mi
{82895}{82927}{y:i}Do-re-mi
{82933}{83025}{y:i}The first three notes|{y:i}Just happen to be
{83031}{83073}{y:i}Do-re-mi
{83079}{83110}{y:i}Do-re-mi
{83116}{83220}{y:i}Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti
{83226}{83321}Let's see if I can make it easier.
{83365}{83453}{y:i}"Doe", a deer|{y:i}A female deer
{83459}{83545}{y:i}"Ray", a drop of golden sun
{83551}{83642}{y:i}"Me", a name I call myself
{83648}{83737}{y:i}"Far", a long long way to run
{83743}{83834}{y:i}"Sew", a needle pulling thread
{83840}{83932}{y:i}"La", a note to follow sew
{83938}{84015}{y:i}"Tea", a drink with jam and bread
{84021}{84125}{y:i}That will bring us back to doe
{84131}{84217}{y:i}- Doe|{y:i}- A deer, a female deer
{84223}{84300}{y:i}- Ray|{y:i}- A drop of golden sun
{84306}{84384}{y:i}- Me|{y:i}- A name I call myself
{84390}{84472}{y:i}- Far|{y:i}- A long long way to run

{84566}{84650}{y:i}- La|{y:i}- A note to follow sew
{84656}{84725}{y:i}- Tea|{y:i}- A drink with jam and bread
{84731}{84785}{y:i}That will bring us back to
{84791}{84874}{y:i}- Doe|{y:i}- A deer, a female deer
{84880}{84958}{y:i}Ray, a drop of golden sun
{84964}{85042}{y:i}Me, a name I call myself
{85048}{85122}{y:i}Far, a long long way to run
{85128}{85206}{y:i}Sew, a needle pulling thread
{85212}{85294}{y:i}La, a note to follow sew
{85300}{85362}{y:i}Tea, a drink with jam and bread
{85368}{85469}{y:i}That will bring us back to doe
{85475}{85554}{y:i}Do-re-mi-fa-so-la-ti-do, so-do
{85560}{85670}Do-re-mi-fa-so and so on are only|the tools we use to build a song.
{85676}{85753}Once you have them in your head|you can sing different tunes...
{85759}{85834}...by mixing them up. Like this:
{85840}{85972}{y:i}So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re
{85978}{86003}Can you do that?
{86009}{86140}{y:i}So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re
{86146}{86282}{y:i}So-do-la-ti-do-re-do
{86288}{86415}{y:i}So-do-la-ti-do-re-do
{86421}{86462}Now, put it all together.
{86468}{86627}{y:i}So-do-la-fa-mi-do-re
{86633}{86783}{y:i}So-do-la-ti-do-re-do
{86789}{86852}- Good.|- But it doesn't mean anything.
{86858}{86929}So we put in words.|One word for every note.
{86935}{86965}Like this:
{86971}{87128}{y:i}When you know the notes to sing
{87134}{87270}{y:i}You can sing most anything
{87276}{87298}Together!
{87304}{87465}{y:i}When you know the notes to sing
{87471}{87635}{y:i}You can sing most anything
{87641}{87722}{y:i}- Doe|{y:i}- A deer, a female deer
{87728}{87804}{y:i}- Ray|{y:i}- A drop of golden sun

{88144}{88215}{y:i}- Tea|{y:i}- A drink with jam and bread

{88691}{88728}{y:i}Re-fa-fa-la-ti-ti
{88734}{88893}{y:i}When you know the notes to sing
{88899}{89063}{y:i}You can sing most anything

{90663}{90737}The mountains are magnificent,|really magnificent.
{90743}{90807}- I had them put up just for you.|- Oh?
{90813}{90866}Even if it's to a height|of 10,000 feet...
{90872}{90956}...Georg always believes in|"rising to the occasion".
{90962}{91026}Improve the jokes|or I'll disinvite you.
{91032}{91094}You didn't invite me.|I invited myself.
{91100}{91161}- Naturally.|- You needed a chaperone...
{91167}{91232}...and I needed a place|where the cuisine is superb...
{91238}{91302}...the wine cellar unexcelled...
{91308}{91374}...and the price perfect.
{91380}{91424}Max, you are outrageous.
{91430}{91525}Not at all.|I'm a very charming sponge.
{91588}{91653}Listen.
{91672}{91763}That's the Klopmann Monastery Choir.
{91798}{91856}They're good.
{91862}{91914}Very good.
{91920}{91982}I must explore this area|in the next few days.
{91988}{92072}Somewhere, a hungry singing group|is waiting for Max Detweiler...
{92078}{92180}...to pluck it out and make it famous|at the Salzburg Folk Festival.
{92186}{92265}- They get fame, you get money.|- It's unfair, I admit it.
{92271}{92379}But someday that'll be changed.|I shall get the fame too.
{92545}{92625}Good heavens, what's this?
{92631}{92723}It's nothing.|Just some local urchins.
{93052}{93159}This really is exciting for me, Georg.|Being here with you.
{93165}{93227}Trees, lakes,|you've seen them before.
{93233}{93296}That is not what I mean,|and you know it.
{93302}{93397}- You mean me? I'm exciting?|- Is that so impossible?
{93403}{93476}No, just highly improbable.
{93482}{93618}- There you go, running yourself down.|- Well, I'm a dangerous driver.
{93672}{93760}You're much less of a riddle|when I see you here, Georg.
{93766}{93834}- In my natural habitat?|- Yes, exactly.
{93840}{93892}Are you saying that I'm more|at home...
{93898}{93994}...among the birds and the flowers|and the wind that moves...
{94000}{94052}...through the trees|like a restless sea?
{94058}{94095}How poetic.
{94101}{94167}Yes, it was rather, wasn't it?
{94173}{94295}More at home here than in Vienna|in all your glittering salons...
{94301}{94406}...gossiping gaily with bores I|detest, soaking myself in champagne...
{94412}{94502}...stumbling about to waltzes|by Strausses I can't even remember?
{94508}{94559}- Is that what you're saying?|- Yes.
{94565}{94658}Now whatever gave you that idea?
{94702}{94797}Oh, I do like it here, Georg.|It's so lovely and peaceful.
{94803}{94850}How can you leave it so often?
{94856}{94924}Oh, pretending to be madly active,|I suppose.
{94930}{95020}Activity suggests a life|filled with purpose.
{95026}{95107}Could it be running away|from memories?
{95113}{95151}Mm-hm.
{95157}{95261}Or perhaps just searching|for a reason to stay.
{95267}{95361}I hope that's why you've been|coming to Vienna so often.
{95367}{95471}- Were there other distractions?|- I'd hardly call you a distraction.
{95477}{95578}Well, what would you call me, Georg?
{95595}{95644}Lovely...
{95650}{95712}...charming, witty, graceful,|the perfect hostess...
{95718}{95790}...and, you're going to hate me|for this...
{95796}{95846}...in a way, my savior.
{95852}{95895}Oh, how unromantic.
{95901}{95957}I'd be an ungrateful wretch|if I didn't say...
{95963}{96078}...that you brought some meaning back|into my life.
{96085}{96150}I am amusing, I suppose.
{96156}{96270}I have the finest couturier in Vienna|and a glittering circle of friends.
{96276}{96351}- I do give some rather gay parties.|- Oh, yes.
{96357}{96400}But take all that away...
{96406}{96522}...and you have just wealthy,|unattached little me...
{96528}{96596}...searching, just like you.
{96708}{96749}More strudel, Herr Detweiler?
{96755}{96792}- How many have I had?|- Two.
{96798}{96881}Make it an uneven three.
{96923}{96995}Still eating, Max?|Must be unhappy.
{97001}{97096}That mixed quartet I've been trying|to steal away from Sol Hurok...
{97102}{97165}- What happened?|...Sascha Petrie stole them first.
{97171}{97202}I hate thieves.
{97208}{97287}Max, you really must try|and learn to love yourself.
{97293}{97349}I had to call Paris, Rome|and Stockholm.
{97355}{97446}- On Georg's telephone, of course.|- How else could I afford it?
{97452}{97576}I like rich people, the way they live|and how I live when I'm with them.
{97582}{97634}I wonder where the children are.
{97640}{97701}They must have heard|I was coming and hid.
{97707}{97767}I was hoping they'd be here|to welcome you.
{97773}{97918}Max, do step out of character for|a moment and try and be charming.
{98098}{98147}Well?
{98153}{98181}Well what?
{98187}{98257}Have you made up his mind?|Do I hear wedding bells?
{98263}{98311}- Pealing madly.|- Marvelous.
{98317}{98381}- Not necessarily for me.|- What kind of talk's that?
{98387}{98426}None-of-your-business talk.
{98432}{98492}I'm terribly fond of him,|so don't toy with us.
{98498}{98584}But I'm a child. I like toys.|So tell me everything.
{98590}{98742}Come on. Tell me every teensy-weensy,|intimate, disgusting detail.
{98748}{98847}Well, let's just say I have a feeling|I may be here on approval.
{98853}{98926}- I approve of that. How can you miss?|- Far too easily.
{98932}{99009}If I know you, darling,|and I do, you will find a way.
{99015}{99076}- He's no ordinary man.|- No, he's rich.
{99082}{99135}His wife's death gave him|a great heartache.
{99141}{99215}And your husband's death|gave you a great fortune.
{99221}{99267}Oh, Max, you really are a beast.
{99273}{99369}You and Georg are like family.|That's why I want to see you married.
{99375}{99498}We must keep all that lovely money|in the family.
{99851}{99922}- What are you doing there?|- Oh, Captain von Trapp.
{99928}{99992}I was just looking for...
{99998}{100074}I didn't see, I mean,|I didn't know you were...
{100080}{100132}Heil Hitler!
{100138}{100174}Who are you?
{100180}{100233}I have a telegram for Herr Detweiler.
{100239}{100343}- I am Herr Detweiler.|- Yes, sir.
{100427}{100528}You've delivered your telegram.|Now get out.
{100652}{100732}- Georg, he's just a boy.|- Yes, and I'm just an Austrian.
{100738}{100806}Things will happen.|Make sure they don't happen to you.
{100812}{100877}Max! Don't you ever say that again.
{100883}{100936}I have no political convictions.
{100942}{101032}- Can I help it if other people do?|- You can help it.
{101038}{101128}You must help it.
{101338}{101413}Hello?
{101438}{101507}You're far away. Where are you?
{101513}{101592}In a world that's disappearing,|I'm afraid.
{101626}{101748}Is there any way I could bring you|back to the world I'm in?
{102121}{102212}{y:i}And that will bring us back to doe
{102218}{102280}{y:i}A deer, a female deer
{102333}{102406}- Father! Father!|- There's your father!
{102412}{102513}Oh, captain, you're home!
{102677}{102778}Come out of that water at once!
{102958}{103048}Oh, you must be Baroness Schraeder.
{103138}{103248}I'm soaked to the skin!
{103498}{103568}Straight line!
{103883}{103978}This is Baroness Schraeder.
{104003}{104045}And these...
{104051}{104109}...are my children.
{104115}{104172}How do you do?
{104178}{104328}Go inside, dry off, clean up, change|your clothes and report back here!
{104411}{104498}Frulein, you will stay here, please!
{104503}{104625}I think I'd better go see|what Max is up to.
{104833}{104913}Now, frulein...
{104922}{104975}...I want a truthful answer.
{104981}{105017}Yes, captain.
{105023}{105151}Is it possible,|or could I have just imagined it?
{105157}{105270}Have my children, by any chance,|been climbing trees today?
{105276}{105324}Yes, captain.
{105330}{105369}I see.
{105375}{105483}And where, may I ask,|did they get these...
{105489}{105538}- Play clothes.|- Is that what they are?
{105544}{105639}I made them from the drapes|that used to hang in my bedroom.
{105645}{105695}- Drapes?|- They have plenty of wear left.
{105701}{105747}We've been everywhere in them.
{105753}{105860}Are you telling me that my children|have been roaming about Salzburg...
{105866}{105945}...dressed up in nothing|but some old drapes?
{105951}{105990}And having a marvelous time!
{105996}{106073}- They have uniforms.|- Forgive me, straitjackets.
{106079}{106146}They can't be children|if they worry about clothes...
{106152}{106179}They don't complain.
{106185}{106249}They don't dare.|They love you too much and fear...
{106255}{106292}Don't discuss my children.
{106298}{106343}You've got to hear, you're|never home...
{106349}{106384}I don't want to hear more!
{106390}{106464}I know you don't, but you've got to!
{106470}{106522}- Liesl's not a child.|- Not one word...
{106528}{106597}Soon she'll be a woman|and you won't even know her.
{106603}{106677}Friedrich wants to be a man|but you're not here to show...
{106683}{106715}Don't you dare tell me...
{106721}{106799}Brigitta could tell you about him.|She notices everything.
{106805}{106879}Kurt acts tough to hide the pain|when you ignore him...
{106885}{106922}...the way you do all of them.
{106928}{106986}Louisa, I don't know about yet.
{106992}{107069}The little ones just want love.|Please, love them all.
{107075}{107112}I don't care to hear more.
{107118}{107253}- I am not finished yet, captain!|- Oh, yes, you are, captain!
{107253}{107305}Frulein.
{107311}{107410}Now, you will pack|your things this minute...
{107416}{107475}...and return to the abbey.
{107538}{107608}What's that?
{107612}{107647}It's singing.
{107653}{107737}Yes, I realize it's singing.|But who is singing?
{107743}{107818}The children.
{107850}{107889}The children?
{107895}{107998}I taught them something to sing|for the baroness.
{108096}{108241}{y:i}My heart wants to sing|{y:i}Every song it hears
{108247}{108309}{y:i}Every song that it hears
{108315}{108446}{y:i}My heart wants to beat like the wings|{y:i}Of the birds that rise
{108452}{108527}{y:i}From the lake to the trees
{108533}{108567}{y:i}To the trees
{108573}{108690}{y:i}My heart wants to sigh|{y:i}Like a chime that flies
{108696}{108807}{y:i}From a church on a breeze
{108813}{108907}{y:i}To laugh like a brook|{y:i}When it trips and falls
{108913}{108984}{y:i}Over stones on its way
{108990}{109024}{y:i}On its way
{109030}{109135}{y:i}To sing through the night
{109141}{109277}{y:i}Like a lark who is learning to pray
{109283}{109390}{y:i}I go to the hills
{109396}{109546}{y:i}When my heart is lonely
{109552}{109641}{y:i}I know I will hear
{109647}{109799}{y:i}What I've heard before
{109805}{109907}{y:i}My heart will be blessed
{109913}{110095}{y:i}With the sound of music
{110101}{110225}{y:i}And I'll sing...
{110231}{110463}{y:i}... once more
{111223}{111303}Edelweiss!
{111360}{111473}You never told me how enchanting|your children are.
{111643}{111718}Don't go away.
{111803}{111873}Frulein.
{111917}{111974}I...
{111980}{112085}...behaved badly. I apologize.
{112091}{112180}I'm far too outspoken.|It's one of my worst faults.
{112186}{112258}You were right.
{112280}{112351}I don't know my children.
{112357}{112457}There's still time, captain.|They want so much to be close to you.
{112463}{112582}And you brought music back|into the house.
{112588}{112660}I'd forgotten.
{112688}{112758}Frulein.
{112780}{112848}I want you to stay.
{112907}{113010}I ask you to stay.
{113017}{113109}- If I could be of any help.|- You have already.
{113115}{113177}More than you know.
{113613}{113656}Marta.
{113662}{113730}Curtain!
{113756}{113873}{y:i}High on a hill was a lonely goatherd
{113873}{113980}{y:i}Loud was the voice|{y:i}Of the lonely goatherd
{113986}{114103}{y:i}Folks in a town|{y:i}That was quite remote heard
{114103}{114218}{y:i}Lusty and clear|{y:i}From the goatherd's throat heard
{114457}{114563}Marta. Marta!
{114583}{114668}Gretl, the prince!
{114673}{114784}{y:i}A prince on the bridge|{y:i}Of a castle moat heard
{114790}{114884}{y:i}Men on a road|{y:i}With a load to tote heard
{114907}{115012}{y:i}Men in the midst|{y:i}Of a table d'hte heard
{115018}{115102}{y:i}Men drinking beer|{y:i}With the foam afloat heard
{115361}{115473}{y:i}One little girl|{y:i}In a pale pink coat heard
{115476}{115577}{y:i}She yodeled back|{y:i}To the lonely goatherd
{115583}{115696}{y:i}Soon her mama|{y:i}With a gleaming gloat heard
{115702}{115818}{y:i}What a duet for a girl and goatherd
{116898}{117006}{y:i}One little girl|{y:i}In a pale pink coat heard
{117012}{117117}{y:i}She yodeled back|{y:i}To the lonely goatherd

{117468}{117572}{y:i}Soon the duet will become a trio
{118133}{118170}- Bravo!|- Bravo!
{118176}{118214}Very good!
{118220}{118249}- Bravo!|- Bravo!
{118255}{118309}Wonderful!
{118315}{118390}- Can we keep the puppets, Uncle Max?|Yes, can we?
{118396}{118444}Of course you may, my darlings.
{118450}{118588}Why else did I tell Professor Kohner|to send the bill to your father?
{118640}{118718}Well done, frulein.
{118741}{118787}I really am very much impressed.
{118793}{118878}They're your children, captain.
{119013}{119069}My dear, is there anything|you can't do?
{119075}{119130}Well, I'm not sure|I'll make a good nun.
{119136}{119248}If you have any problems,|I'd be happy to help you.
{119286}{119319}Attention, everyone!
{119325}{119407}I have an announcement to make.|Surprise! Surprise!
{119413}{119469}Today, after a long|and desperate search...
{119475}{119594}...I have found a most exciting|entry for the Salzburg Folk Festival.
{119600}{119644}Congratulations, Max.
{119650}{119758}And who will you|be exploiting this time?
{119763}{119852}- The Saint Ignatius Choir?|- Guess again.
{119858}{119952}Well, let me see now.|The Klopmann Choir?
{119958}{120014}- No, no, no, no.|- No, no?
{120020}{120048}Tell us.
{120054}{120137}A singing group all in one family.|You'll never guess, Georg.
{120143}{120212}What a charming idea!
{120218}{120276}Whose family?
{120282}{120320}Yours.
{120326}{120418}They'll be the talk of the festival.
{120450}{120522}- Well, now, what's so funny?|- You are, Max.
{120528}{120615}You're expensive, but very funny.
{120621}{120677}- They'll be a sensation!|- No, Max.
{120683}{120734}It's a wonderful idea.|Fresh, original.
{120740}{120866}Max! My children|do not sing in public.
{120872}{120918}You can't blame me for trying.
{120924}{121033}Children, who shall we hear|from next?
{121063}{121090}Who?
{121096}{121158}Yes.
{121238}{121305}Yes.
{121337}{121397}The vote is unanimous.
{121403}{121441}You, captain.
{121447}{121490}Me?
{121496}{121588}- I don't understand.|- Please.
{121700}{121751}No, no, no, no.
{121757}{121805}I'm told that you were quite good.
{121811}{121891}- That was a very, very long time ago.|- I remember, Father.
{121897}{122003}- Play us something we know.|- Oh, please, Father.
{122035}{122098}Well...
{122307}{122359}- Why didn't you tell me?|- What?
{122365}{122458}To bring along my harmonica.
{122477}{122565}{y:i}Edelweiss
{122566}{122641}{y:i}Edelweiss
{122647}{122796}{y:i}Every morning you greet me

{125128}{125403}{y:i}Bless my homeland forever
{125587}{125675}Anytime you say the word, Georg,|you can be part of my new act:
{125681}{125761}The von Trapp Family Singers.
{125767}{125827}I have a wonderful idea, Georg.
{125833}{125892}Let's really fill this house|with music.
{125898}{125969}You must give a grand|and glorious party for me.
{125975}{126039}- A party?|- Yes, Father, please!
{126045}{126102}It's high time|I met all your friends...
{126108}{126169}...and they met me.|Don't you agree?
{126175}{126229}- I see what you mean.|- Oh, please!
{126235}{126327}Children, it's bedtime.|Come now, say good night.
{126333}{126364}Good night, Father.
{126370}{126437}- Good night.|- Good night, Baroness Schraeder.
{126443}{126509}Good night, Father.
{126515}{126546}Good night.
{126552}{126633}Good night, Uncle Max.
{126642}{126755}It'll be my first party, Father!
{127498}{127560}- Captain.|- Herr Zeller. Baroness Schraeder.
{127566}{127666}- Good evening, Herr Zeller.|- Baroness.
{127672}{127768}How do you do? Good evening.
{128226}{128345}Did you notice the obvious|display of the Austrian flag?
{128478}{128521}The women look so beautiful.
{128527}{128560}I think they look ugly.
{128566}{128608}You're just scared of them.
{128614}{128677}Silly, only grown-up men fear women.
{128683}{128806}- I think the men look beautiful.|- How would you know?
{129182}{129230}Liesl, who are you dancing with?
{129236}{129289}Nobody.
{129295}{129378}Oh, yes, you are.
{129400}{129435}May I have this dance?
{129441}{129538}I'd be delighted, young man.
{129662}{129727}Why didn't you tell me|you could dance?
{129733}{129888}We feared you'd make us all dance.|The von Trapp Family Dancers.
{129957}{129997}What are they playing?
{130003}{130064}It's the Laendler.|An Austrian folk dance.
{130070}{130146}- Show me.|- I haven't danced since I was little.
{130152}{130199}You remember. Please?
{130205}{130252}- Well...|- Please.
{130258}{130317}All right. Come on over here.
{130323}{130407}Now you bow and I curtsy.
{130413}{130484}- Like this?|- Fine. Now we go for a little walk.
{130490}{130554}One, two, three. One, two, three.
{130560}{130671}One, two, three, step together.|Now, step hop, step hop.
{130677}{130740}Now turn under. Not quite.
{130746}{130851}This way. Hop step, hop.|And under.
{130857}{130897}Kurt, we'll have to practice.
{130903}{130976}Do allow me, will you?
{133056}{133138}I don't remember anymore.
{133153}{133231}- Your face is all red.|- Is it?
{133237}{133287}I don't suppose I'm used to dancing.
{133353}{133400}Why, that was beautifully done.
{133406}{133452}What a lovely couple you make.
{133458}{133509}It's time the children|said good night.
{133515}{133547}We'll be in the hall.
{133553}{133622}- We have something special prepared.|- Right!
{133628}{133694}Yes, come on!
{133821}{133877}All that needless worrying, Georg.
{133883}{133993}You thought you wouldn't find|a friend at the party.
{134026}{134111}- A bit chilly out tonight, isn't it?|- Oh, I don't know.
{134117}{134202}It seemed rather warm to me.
{134267}{134307}Ladies and gentlemen.
{134313}{134448}The children of Captain von Trapp|wish to say good night to you.
{134750}{134842}{y:i}There's a sad sort of clanging|{y:i}From the clock in the hall
{134848}{134938}{y:i}And the bells in the steeple too
{134944}{135040}{y:i}And up in the nursery|{y:i}An absurd little bird
{135046}{135104}{y:i}Is popping up to say "coo-coo"
{135110}{135150}{y:i}Coo-coo
{135156}{135185}{y:i}Coo-coo
{135191}{135242}{y:i}- Regretfully they tell us|{y:i}- Coo-coo
{135248}{135281}{y:i}- But firmly they compel us|{y:i}- Coo-coo
{135287}{135360}{y:i}- To say goodbye|{y:i}- Coo-coo
{135366}{135530}{y:i}To you
{135570}{135662}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, good night
{135668}{135797}{y:i}I hate to go|{y:i}And leave this pretty sight
{135934}{136024}{y:i}So long, farewell,|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, adieu
{136030}{136152}{y:i}Adieu, adieu|{y:i}To you and you and you
{136292}{136383}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen
{136389}{136484}{y:i}I'd like to stay|{y:i}And taste my first champagne
{136490}{136585}- Yes?|- No.
{136652}{136742}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
{136748}{136842}{y:i}I leave and heave a sigh|{y:i}And say goodbye
{136848}{136981}{y:i}Goodbye
{137017}{137091}{y:i}I'm glad to go
{137097}{137168}{y:i}I cannot tell a lie
{137174}{137246}{y:i}I flit, I float
{137252}{137372}{y:i}I fleetly flee, I fly
{137576}{137713}{y:i}The sun has gone to bed
{137719}{137807}{y:i}And so must I
{137813}{137871}{y:i}So long
{137877}{137937}{y:i}Farewell
{137943}{138073}{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
{138079}{138218}{y:i}Goodbye
{138224}{138357}{y:i}Goodbye
{138363}{138527}{y:i}Goodbye
{138533}{138773}{y:i}Goodbye
{138857}{138923}Extraordinary!|What they'd do at the festival.
{138929}{139006}Young lady,|I must have a word with you.
{139012}{139109}Georg, you won't let this girl|get away. She must join the party.
{139115}{139173}- No, really I...|- Stop. Stop it now.
{139179}{139249}- Georg, please.|- You can if you want to, frulein.
{139255}{139314}I insist.|You will be my dinner partner.
{139320}{139366}This is business.|Franz...
{139372}{139485}...set another place next to mine|for Frulein Maria.
{139500}{139578}- Whatever you say.|- It appears to be all arranged.
{139584}{139649}- It does.|- I'm not suitably dressed.
{139655}{139729}You can change. We'll wait.
{139732}{139772}All right.
{139778}{139847}Captain, you must be very proud|of your youngsters.
{139853}{139874}I am, thank you.
{139880}{139989}Is there a more beautiful expression|of what is good in our country...
{139995}{140081}...than the innocent voices|of our children?
{140087}{140120}Oh, come now, baron.
{140126}{140231}Would you have us believe that Austria|holds a monopoly on virtue?
{140237}{140336}Herr Zeller, some of us prefer|Austrian voices raised in song...
{140342}{140419}...to ugly German threats.
{140425}{140511}The ostrich buries his head|in the sand...
{140517}{140594}...and sometimes in the flag.
{140600}{140701}Perhaps those who would warn you that|the Anschluss is coming, and it is...
{140707}{140795}...would get further with you by setting|their words to music.
{140801}{140914}If the Nazis take over Austria, you|will be the entire trumpet section.
{140920}{140964}You flatter me.
{140970}{141100}Oh, how clumsy of me.|I meant to accuse you.
{141257}{141308}It's very kind of you|to offer to help me, baroness.
{141314}{141357}I'm delighted, Maria.
{141363}{141458}I really don't think I have anything|that would be appropriate.
{141464}{141563}Now where is that lovely little thing|you were wearing the other evening?
{141569}{141685}When the captain couldn't keep|his eyes off you.
{141729}{141798}Couldn't keep his eyes off me?
{141804}{141848}Come, my dear, we are women.
{141854}{141934}Let's not pretend we don't know|when a man notices us.
{141940}{142030}- Here we are.|- The captain notices everybody.
{142036}{142095}There's no need to feel|so defensive, Maria.
{142101}{142159}You are quite attractive, you know.
{142165}{142290}The captain would hardly be a man|if he didn't notice you.
{142290}{142353}Baroness, I hope you're joking.
{142359}{142389}Not at all.
{142395}{142433}I've never done a thing to...
{142439}{142487}You don't have to, my dear.
{142493}{142632}Nothing's more irresistible to a man|than a woman who's in love with him.
{142638}{142714}- In love with him?|- Of course.
{142720}{142839}What makes it so nice is|he thinks he's in love with you.
{142867}{142908}But that's not true.
{142914}{142999}Surely you've noticed the way|he looks into your eyes.
{143005}{143147}And you know, you blushed in his arms|when you were dancing just now.
{143153}{143194}Don't take it to heart.
{143200}{143255}He'll get over it soon enough,|I think.
{143261}{143327}Men do, you know.
{143333}{143384}Then I should go.
{143390}{143463}I mustn't stay here.
{143677}{143795}- Is there something I can do to help?|- No, nothing.
{143802}{143849}Yes.
{143855}{143941}Don't say a word to the captain.
{143943}{144065}No, I wouldn't dream of it.
{144190}{144242}Goodbye, Maria.
{144248}{144352}I'm sure you'll make a very fine nun.
{145035}{145087}Champagne, darling.
{145093}{145225}I feel like celebrating. Cheers.
{145320}{145389}- You know something.|- Perhaps.
{145395}{145504}If you're so clever, tell me how to|get frulein to influence Georg.
{145510}{145577}I want those children in the festival.
{145583}{145638}Elsa, this is important to Austria.
{145644}{145685}Wouldn't do you any harm either.
{145691}{145728}I thought of that.
{145734}{145792}Well, if it's a matter of influence...
{145798}{145905}...maybe the one you have|to be talking to is me.
{150820}{150874}Two.|Three.
{150880}{150940}Four.|Five.
{150946}{150995}- Six.|- Seven.
{151001}{151040}Eight.
{151046}{151110}- Four.|- Two.
{151116}{151159}Seven.|Five.
{151165}{151255}- Two.|- Six.
{151330}{151405}Isn't this fun?
{151411}{151469}- Four.|- I'm number five.
{151475}{151527}- Oh, yes.|Eight.
{151533}{151594}Two.|Four.
{151600}{151665}Six.
{151689}{151740}Two.
{151746}{151817}Baroness Schraeder, do you mind|if we stop now? We're tired.
{151823}{151870}Whatever you want, dear.
{151876}{151960}We'll do it again tomorrow.
{152168}{152239}The country's so restful, isn't it?
{152245}{152308}Have some lemonade.
{152314}{152375}There must be an easier way.
{152381}{152477}I get a fiendish delight thinking|of you as the mother of seven.
{152483}{152527}How do you plan to do it?
{152533}{152582}Darling, haven't you ever heard...
{152588}{152683}...of a delightful little thing|called boarding school?
{152689}{152770}Baroness Machiavelli.
{152776}{152824}Uncle Max, where's Father?
{152830}{152873}I think he's in the house.
{152879}{152940}What's the matter|with all you gloomy pussies?
{152946}{153012}- Nothing.|- I know. Let's have a rehearsal.
{153018}{153038}What for?
{153044}{153103}Let's make believe we're on-stage|at the festival.
{153109}{153202}- I don't feel like singing.|- Not without Frulein Maria.
{153208}{153265}Liesl, get the guitar.|Come on, Marta.
{153271}{153342}Everybody into the group.|Get in your places.
{153348}{153451}Now be cheerful, right?|Give us the key, Liesl.
{153460}{153523}Now, impress me.
{153620}{153653}Gretl, why don't you sing?
{153659}{153737}I can't. I've got a sore finger.
{153743}{153815}But you sang so beautifully|the night of the party.
{153821}{153877}Come on, all of you.|Try something you know.
{153883}{153919}Enjoy it. Be cheerful.
{153925}{154001}All right, Liesl.
{154011}{154140}{y:i}The hills are alive
{154146}{154353}{y:i}With the sound of music
{154359}{154480}{y:i}With songs they have sung
{154486}{154684}{y:i}For a thousand years
{154690}{154820}{y:i}The hills fill my heart
{154826}{155013}{y:i}With the sound of music
{155019}{155082}They wanted to sing for me,|bless their hearts.
{155088}{155170}That's lovely, lovely.|Don't stop.
{155230}{155328}- Something long and cool, Georg?|- No, thank you, darling.
{155334}{155397}- Father?|- Yes, Brigitta?
{155403}{155458}Is it true Frulein Maria|isn't coming back?
{155464}{155540}Yes, I suppose it's true.|What have we got here?
{155546}{155670}Pink lemonade.|Laced with lemonade.
{155676}{155713}I don't believe it, Father.
{155719}{155740}Hm?
{155746}{155798}- What?|- About Frulein Maria.
{155804}{155834}Oh, Frulein Maria!
{155840}{155935}Didn't I tell you what her note said?|I'm sure I did.
{155941}{156002}She said she missed her life|at the abbey.
{156008}{156059}She had to leave us.
{156065}{156141}And that's all there is to it.
{156145}{156208}I think I'm brave enough to try|some of that.
{156214}{156280}- She didn't even say goodbye.|- She did in her note.
{156286}{156330}That isn't the same thing.
{156336}{156388}Not too sweet, not too sour.
{156394}{156470}Just too pink.
{156476}{156587}Father, who is our new governess|going to be?
{156710}{156771}Well...
{156791}{156920}...you're not going to have|a governess anymore.
{156926}{157025}- We're not?|- No.
{157043}{157114}You're going to have a new mother.
{157120}{157182}A new mother?
{157188}{157263}We talked about it last night.|It's all settled.
{157269}{157370}And we're all going to be very happy.
{158125}{158220}Well, all right, all right.|Run off and play.
{158951}{158973}Yes, my children?
{158979}{159042}- My name is Liesl.|- Yes, Liesl?
{159048}{159165}We, my brothers and sisters,|want to see Frulein Maria.
{159171}{159230}Frulein Maria?
{159236}{159320}Oh, Maria.
{159330}{159410}Come in, please.
{159468}{159540}Wait here.
{159766}{159843}I'm Sister Margaretta. I understand|you inquired about Maria.
{159849}{159909}We have to see her.|Will you tell her we're here?
{159915}{159977}- I'm afraid I can't do that.|- But you've got to!
{159983}{160032}- She's our governess.|- We want her back.
{160038}{160084}She didn't even say goodbye.
{160090}{160145}All we want to do is talk to her.
{160151}{160220}I'm very sorry,|but Maria is in seclusion.
{160226}{160300}- She hasn't been seeing anyone.|- She'll see us.
{160306}{160365}I want to show her my finger.
{160371}{160417}Some other time, dear.
{160423}{160454}I'll tell her you were here.
{160460}{160543}- It was sweet of you to call.|- We have to speak to her!
{160549}{160623}Run along, children.|Run along home.
{160629}{160669}I'm sure she'd like to see us.
{160675}{160728}Sister Margaretta, please.
{160734}{160860}- Goodbye, children.|Sister Margaretta, please?
{160891}{160932}What was that about, Sister?
{160938}{160990}The von Trapp children,|Reverend Mother.
{160996}{161055}They want to see Maria.
{161061}{161117}Has she spoken yet?|Has she told you anything?
{161123}{161219}She doesn't say a word,|Reverend Mother, except in prayer.
{161225}{161248}Poor child.
{161254}{161325}It's strange.|She seems happy to be back here...
{161331}{161433}...and yet she's unhappy too.
{161439}{161514}Perhaps I have been wrong|in leaving her alone so long.
{161520}{161583}Bring her to me,|even if she's not yet ready.
{161589}{161665}Yes, Reverend Mother.
{161761}{161864}Sister Augusta, take our new postulant|to the robing room.
{161870}{161923}God bless you, my daughter.
{162073}{162151}Yes, bring her in.
{162331}{162420}You've been unhappy. I'm sorry.
{162433}{162465}Reverend Mother.
{162471}{162548}Why did they send you back to us?
{162554}{162637}They didn't send me back.|I left.
{162661}{162705}Sit down, Maria.
{162711}{162791}Tell me what happened.
{162879}{162910}I was frightened.
{162916}{163024}- Frightened? Were they unkind to you.|- Oh, no!
{163030}{163148}No, I was confused. I felt...
{163154}{163204}I've never felt that way before.
{163210}{163300}I couldn't stay. I knew that here|I'd be away from it. I'd be safe.
{163306}{163419}Maria, our abbey is not to be used|as an escape.
{163425}{163515}What is it you can't face?
{163526}{163574}I can't face him again.
{163580}{163652}Him?
{163655}{163740}Thank you, Sister Margaretta.
{163934}{164010}Captain von Trapp?
{164104}{164169}- Are you in love with him?|- I don't know!
{164175}{164217}I don't know. I...
{164223}{164315}The baroness said I was.|She said that he was in love with me.
{164321}{164405}But I didn't want to believe it.
{164411}{164465}There were times we looked|at each other.
{164471}{164510}I could hardly breathe.
{164516}{164590}- Did you let him see your feelings?|- I don't know.
{164596}{164659}That's what's torturing me.|I was on God's errand.
{164665}{164820}To have asked for his love would have|been wrong. I just couldn't stay.
{164836}{164919}I'm ready at this moment|to take my vows.
{164925}{165036}- Please help me.|- Maria.
{165036}{165149}The love of a man and a woman is holy.|You have a great capacity to love.
{165155}{165225}You must find out how God|wants you to spend your love.
{165231}{165323}But I pledged my life to God.|I pledged my life to his service.
{165329}{165471}My daughter, if you love this man,|it doesn't mean you love God less.
{165474}{165518}No.
{165524}{165605}You must find out.
{165611}{165671}You must go back.
{165677}{165723}You can't ask me to do that.
{165729}{165788}- Please let me stay. I beg...|- Maria.
{165794}{165888}These walls were not built|to shut out problems.
{165894}{165940}You have to face them.
{165946}{166061}You have to live the life|you were born to live.
{166164}{166268}{y:i}Climb every mountain
{166274}{166364}{y:i}Search high and low
{166370}{166484}{y:i}Follow every byway
{166490}{166597}{y:i}Every path you know
{166603}{166710}{y:i}Climb every mountain
{166716}{166820}{y:i}Ford every stream
{166826}{166931}{y:i}Follow every rainbow
{166937}{167040}{y:i}Till you find your dream
{167046}{167120}{y:i}A dream that will need
{167126}{167254}{y:i}All the love you can give
{167260}{167342}{y:i}Every day of your life
{167348}{167503}{y:i}For as long as you live
{167509}{167612}{y:i}Climb every mountain
{167618}{167722}{y:i}Ford every stream
{167728}{167837}{y:i}Follow every rainbow
{167843}{168065}{y:i}Till you find your dream
{168071}{168155}{y:i}A dream that will need
{168161}{168295}{y:i}All the love you can give
{168301}{168384}{y:i}Every day of your life
{168390}{168545}{y:i}For as long as you live
{168551}{168657}{y:i}Climb every mountain
{168663}{168767}{y:i}Ford every stream
{168773}{168888}{y:i}Follow every rainbow
{168894}{168992}{y:i}Till you find...
{168998}{169273}{y:i}... your dream
{169299}{169383}Now, it's not like my children|to be secretive.
{169389}{169475}We're not being secretive, Father.
{169480}{169560}And it's not like my children|to be late for dinner.
{169566}{169662}- We lost track of the time.|- I see.
{169668}{169750}Who's going to be the first one|to tell me the truth? Friedrich.
{169756}{169832}Brigitta. Liesl.
{169838}{169910}Where do you think we were, Father?
{169916}{169980}No?
{170050}{170181}If you don't believe us, you must have|some idea of where you think we were.
{170231}{170273}- Marta.|- Yes, Father.
{170279}{170334}You tell me.
{170340}{170442}Friedrich told you, Father.|We were berry picking.
{170448}{170559}- I forgot! You were berry picking.|- Yes, we love berry picking.
{170565}{170592}All afternoon?
{170598}{170638}- We picked thousands.|- Thousands?
{170644}{170714}- They were all over the place.|- What kind of berries?
{170720}{170835}- Blueberries, sir.|- Blueberries.
{170845}{170955}It's too early for blueberries.
{170961}{171023}- They were strawberries.|- Strawberries?
{171029}{171130}It's been so cold lately,|they turned blue.
{171159}{171227}Aw.
{171233}{171309}Very well. Show me the berries.
{171315}{171345}- We...|- Well...
{171351}{171417}- Show me the berries you picked.|- We don't have them.
{171423}{171477}You don't have them?|What happened to them?
{171483}{171549}- We...|- We ate them.
{171555}{171616}- You ate them?|- Yes!
{171622}{171659}- They were so good.|- Delicious.
{171665}{171695}Very well.
{171701}{171824}Since you've obviously stuffed|yourselves on thousands of berries...
{171830}{171924}...you can't be hungry anymore,|so I'll have to tell Frau Schmidt...
{171930}{172035}...to skip your dinner.
{172219}{172285}It's your fault.|We should have told him the truth.
{172291}{172338}And made him boiling mad at us?
{172344}{172390}It's better than starving to death.
{172396}{172490}We didn't do anything wrong.|We just wanted to see her.
{172496}{172575}My stomach's making noises.
{172581}{172670}The least they could have done|was to let us say hello.
{172676}{172774}- I wonder what grass tastes like.|- I feel awful.
{172780}{172891}When Frulein Maria wanted to feel|better she used to sing that song.
{172897}{172932}Let's try it.
{172938}{173002}{y:i}Raindrops on roses
{173008}{173120}{y:i}And whiskers on kittens
{173126}{173187}{y:i}Bright copper kettles
{173193}{173293}{y:i}And warm woolen mittens
{173299}{173442}{y:i}Brown paper packages|{y:i}Tied up with strings
{173448}{173592}{y:i}These are a few of my favorite things
{173598}{173669}Why don't I feel better?
{173675}{173730}{y:i}Girls in white dresses
{173736}{173810}{y:i}With blue satin sashes
{173816}{173955}{y:i}Snowflakes that stay|{y:i}On my nose and eyelashes
{173961}{174035}{y:i}- Silver white winters...|Frulein Maria's back!
{174041}{174077}{y:i}... that melt into springs
{174083}{174160}{y:i}These are a few of my favorite things
{174166}{174240}{y:i}When the dog bites|{y:i}When the bee stings
{174246}{174303}{y:i}When I'm feeling sad
{174309}{174380}{y:i}I simply remember my favorite things
{174386}{174440}{y:i}And then I don't feel
{174446}{174607}{y:i}So bad
{174613}{174685}- Children, I'm so glad to see you.|- We missed you.
{174691}{174717}I missed you.
{174723}{174810}- Kurt, how are you?|- Hungry.
{174811}{174874}- What happened to your finger?|- It got caught.
{174880}{174955}- Caught in what?|- Friedrich's teeth.
{174961}{175013}- Liesl, you all right?|- Just fair.
{175019}{175090}- Any telegrams been delivered lately?|- None at all.
{175096}{175179}But I'm learning to accept it.|I'll be glad when school begins.
{175185}{175298}Liesl, you can't use school to escape|your problems. You have to face them.
{175304}{175339}I have so much to tell you.
{175345}{175395}We have things to tell you too.
{175401}{175489}The most important thing is|that Father is going to be married.
{175495}{175522}Married?
{175528}{175613}Yes, to Baroness Schraeder.
{175766}{175840}Oh, I see.
{175848}{175928}Father, look!|Frulein Maria's back!
{175934}{176019}Frulein Maria's back from the abbey.
{176036}{176098}Good evening, captain.
{176098}{176165}Good evening.
{176189}{176234}Everyone inside for dinner.
{176240}{176316}Dinner!
{176503}{176633}You left without saying goodbye.|Even to the children.
{176639}{176713}It was wrong of me. Forgive me.
{176726}{176753}Why did you?
{176759}{176849}Please don't ask me.|The reason no longer exists.
{176855}{176952}Frulein Maria, you've returned.
{176958}{177038}Isn't it wonderful, Georg?
{177081}{177133}I wish you every happiness,|baroness.
{177139}{177205}You too, captain.|The children say you're to marry.
{177211}{177273}Thank you, my dear.
{177299}{177420}You are back to stay?
{177434}{177551}Only until arrangements can be made|for another governess.
{178849}{178925}There you are.
{179232}{179293}I must speak to cook|about the schnitzel.
{179299}{179382}It is entirely too delicious|for my figure.
{179388}{179459}And it makes you much too quiet|at the dinner table.
{179465}{179513}Or was it the wine?
{179519}{179599}Undoubtedly the wine.
{179624}{179679}You have no idea|the trouble I'm having...
{179685}{179751}...trying to decide on|a wedding present for you.
{179757}{179809}Oh, I know. I'm enough.
{179815}{179902}But I do want you to have|some little trifle for the occasion.
{179908}{179964}At first I thought|of a fountain pen...
{179970}{180024}...but you've already got one.
{180030}{180101}Then I thought perhaps a villa|in the south of France...
{180107}{180171}...but they are so difficult|to gift-wrap.
{180177}{180235}Oh, Georg, how do you|feel about yachts?
{180241}{180296}A long, sleek one|for the Mediterranean...
{180302}{180405}...or a tiny one|for your bathtub, huh?
{180420}{180469}- Elsa.|- Where to go on our honeymoon?
{180475}{180512}Now, that's a real problem.
{180518}{180599}A trip around the world|would be lovely. And then I said:
{180605}{180674}"Oh, Elsa, there must be|someplace better to go".
{180680}{180749}- But don't worry, darling, I'll...|- Elsa.
{180755}{180803}Yes, Georg.
{180809}{180864}It's no use...
{180870}{180940}...you and I.
{180940}{181044}I'm being dishonest to both of us...
{181050}{181126}...and utterly unfair to you.
{181215}{181297}- When two people talk of marriage...|- No, don't.
{181303}{181389}Don't say another word, please.
{181432}{181569}You see, there are other things|I've been thinking of.
{181575}{181724}Fond as I am of you, I really don't|think you're the right man for me.
{181749}{181809}You're much too independent.
{181815}{181929}And I need someone|who needs me desperately...
{181935}{182044}...or at least needs|my money desperately.
{182060}{182214}I've enjoyed every moment we've had|together and I do thank you for that.
{182244}{182289}Now, if you'll forgive me...
{182295}{182344}...I'll go inside,|pack my little bags...
{182350}{182446}...and return to Vienna|where I belong.
{182539}{182583}And somewhere out there...
{182589}{182695}...is a young lady who, I think...
{182701}{182767}...will never be a nun.
{183022}{183114}Auf Wiedersehen, darling.
{183695}{183759}Hello.
{183862}{183984}I thought I just might find you here.
{184048}{184106}Was there something you wanted?
{184112}{184204}No, no, no. Sit down, please.
{184210}{184280}Please.
{184365}{184435}May I?
{184695}{184829}You know, I was thinking|and I was wondering two things:
{184835}{184951}Why did you run away to the abbey?
{184957}{185106}And what was it|that made you come back?
{185110}{185216}Well, I had an obligation|to fulfill...
{185222}{185282}...and I came back to fulfill it.
{185288}{185349}Is that all?
{185355}{185408}And I missed the children.
{185414}{185467}Yes.
{185473}{185542}- Only the children?|- No. Yes.
{185548}{185639}- Isn't it right that I missed them?|- Oh, yes. Yes, of course.
{185645}{185729}I was only hoping that perhaps you...
{185735}{185813}Perhaps you might...
{185819}{185884}Yes?
{185890}{186029}Well, nothing was the same|when you were away...
{186035}{186113}...and it'll be all wrong again|after you leave...
{186119}{186267}...and I just thought perhaps|you might change your mind.
{186328}{186429}Well, I'm sure the baroness will be|able to make things fine for you.
{186435}{186505}Maria...
{186519}{186639}- There isn't going to be any baroness.|- There isn't?
{186660}{186694}No.
{186700}{186780}I don't understand.
{186800}{186899}Well, we've called off our engagement,|you see, and...
{186905}{187009}- Oh, I'm sorry.|- Yes. You are?
{187015}{187088}- You did?|- Yes.
{187094}{187239}Well, you can't marry someone|when you're...
{187263}{187349}...in love with someone else...
{187395}{187465}...can you?
{188265}{188320}The Reverend Mother always says:
{188326}{188444}"When the Lord closes a door,|somewhere He opens a window".
{188609}{188699}What else does|the Reverend Mother say?
{188705}{188799}That you have to look for your life.
{188803}{188899}Is that why you came back?
{188960}{189014}And have you found it...
{189020}{189084}...Maria?
{189090}{189174}I think I have.
{189204}{189274}I know I have.
{189298}{189374}I love you.
{189433}{189529}Oh, can this be happening to me?
{189559}{189724}{y:i}Perhaps I had a wicked childhood
{189724}{189886}{y:i}Perhaps I had a miserable youth
{189895}{190043}{y:i}But somewhere|{y:i}In my wicked, miserable past
{190049}{190204}{y:i}There must have been a moment of truth
{190210}{190384}{y:i}For here you are|{y:i}Standing there loving me
{190390}{190544}{y:i}Whether or not you should
{190550}{190727}{y:i}So somewhere in my youth or childhood
{190733}{190941}{y:i}I must have done something good
{190947}{191039}{y:i}Nothing comes from nothing
{191045}{191152}{y:i}Nothing ever could
{191158}{191407}{y:i}So somewhere in my youth or childhood
{191407}{191651}{y:i}I must have done something good
{191657}{191777}Do you know when I first|started loving you?
{191783}{191876}That night at dinner, when you sat|on that ridiculous pine cone.
{191882}{191939}What?
{191945}{192044}I knew the first time you blew|that silly whistle.
{192050}{192134}Oh, my love.
{192188}{192414}{y:i}For here you are|{y:i}Standing there loving me
{192425}{192592}{y:i}Whether or not you should
{192598}{192779}{y:i}So somewhere in my youth or childhood
{192785}{192993}{y:i}I must have done something good
{192999}{193094}{y:i}Nothing comes from nothing
{193100}{193173}{y:i}Nothing ever could
{193179}{193318}{y:i}So somewhere in my youth...
{193324}{193414}{y:i}... or childhood
{193452}{193645}{y:i}I must have done something
{193658}{193997}{y:i}Something good
{194122}{194194}Maria.
{194203}{194349}Is there anyone I should go to,|to ask permission to marry you?
{194407}{194490}- Why don't we ask...|- The children?
{197070}{197179}{y:i}How do you solve a problem like Maria?
{197185}{197292}{y:i}How do you catch a cloud|{y:i}And pin it down?
{197298}{197401}{y:i}How do you find a word|{y:i}That means Maria?
{197407}{197431}{y:i}A flibbertigibbet
{197437}{197515}{y:i}A will-o'-the-wisp|{y:i}A clown
{197521}{197634}{y:i}Many a thing you know|{y:i}You'd like to tell her
{197640}{197749}{y:i}Many a thing she ought to understand
{197755}{197862}{y:i}But how do you make her stay|{y:i}And listen to all you say?
{197868}{197963}{y:i}How do you keep a wave upon the sand?
{197969}{198092}{y:i}Oh, how do you solve|{y:i}A problem like Maria?
{198098}{198293}{y:i}How do you hold a moonbeam|{y:i}In your hand?
{201280}{201354}Herr Detweiler!
{201380}{201444}- Heil Hitler.|- Oh, good afternoon, Herr Zeller.
{201450}{201529}Perhaps you've not heard.|I am now the Gauleiter.
{201535}{201589}Heil Hitler.
{201595}{201623}Heil Hitler.
{201629}{201689}I've come from|Captain von Trapp's house.
{201695}{201781}The only one in the area|not flying the Third Reich flag...
{201787}{201816}...since the Anschluss.
{201822}{201874}- But we have dealt with that.|- I don't...
{201880}{201951}The housekeeper told me|that I would find you here.
{201957}{202004}The only thing she'd tell me.
{202010}{202071}What kind of information|are you looking for?
{202077}{202129}When will the captain return?
{202135}{202229}Well, he's on his honeymoon trip.|He's not been in touch with us.
{202235}{202351}Am I to believe he hasn't communicated|with his children in over a month?
{202357}{202403}How many men do you know...
{202409}{202503}...who communicate with their children|while honeymooning?
{202509}{202599}Upon his return, he'll fill|his proper position in the new order.
{202605}{202663}Naturally.|And may I congratulate you...
{202669}{202787}...and your people in allowing the|festival to go on tonight as planned.
{202793}{202876}Why should it not go on?|Nothing in Austria has changed.
{202882}{202962}Singing and music will|show this to the world.
{202968}{203024}Austria is the same.
{203030}{203100}Heil Hitler.
{203115}{203189}Heil Hitler.
{203193}{203222}Come, let's go home.
{203228}{203311}- Why was he so cross?|- Everybody's cross these days.
{203317}{203397}Maybe the flag with the black spider|makes people nervous.
{203403}{203473}- Will Father be in trouble?|- He doesn't have to be.
{203479}{203544}The thing to do|is to get along with everybody.
{203550}{203602}Remember that tonight at the concert.
{203608}{203677}Are we really going to sing|before a lot of people?
{203683}{203732}Look. The von Trapp Family Singers:
{203738}{203847}Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Brigitta,|Kurt, Marta and Gretl.
{203853}{203969}- Why am I always last?|- Because you are the most important.
{203975}{204049}There we go.
{204155}{204237}Are you sure Father will approve|of our singing in public?
{204243}{204303}He'll be pleased and proud.
{204309}{204367}- Liesl, do you think so?|- Don't you trust me?
{204373}{204397}No.
{204403}{204459}You're a very intelligent girl.
{204465}{204534}Liesl. Liesl!
{204540}{204587}Rolf!
{204593}{204641}I'm so glad to see you.|It's been su...
{204647}{204677}Good afternoon.
{204683}{204763}Give this to your father|as soon as he's home.
{204769}{204813}- He's on his honeymoon.|- I know.
{204819}{204909}- You do?|- We make it our business to know all.
{204915}{204977}- Who's "we"?|- See that he gets it.
{204983}{205053}- What is it?|- It's a telegram from Berlin.
{205059}{205124}Don't you want to deliver it yourself?
{205130}{205192}I'm occupied|with more important matters.
{205198}{205257}And your father had better be too.
{205263}{205337}But, Rolf!
{205678}{205769}Father! Father!
{205854}{205894}Father!
{205900}{205964}- We didn't expect you so soon.|- Hello, hello!
{205970}{206036}We didn't expect you home|until next week!
{206042}{206193}- Did you bring souvenirs from Paris?|- Hello! How are you?
{206199}{206229}Why didn't you call us?
{206235}{206281}We couldn't get through.
{206287}{206334}I had nothing to do with that.
{206340}{206391}We came back as fast as we could.
{206397}{206449}Well, well, well! We missed you!
{206455}{206512}- We missed you!|- We missed kissing you.
{206518}{206586}We missed all the noise|in the morning.
{206592}{206692}- Mostly, we missed hearing you sing.|- Oh, you came back just in time.
{206698}{206739}Look, Frulein Maria...
{206745}{206788}I mean Mother.
{206794}{206853}We're going to sing|in the festival tonight.
{206859}{206909}We've been having a lovely time!
{206915}{207001}We've been rehearsing all...
{207002}{207068}Surprise! Surprise!
{207074}{207169}Surprises for you on the terrace.
{207207}{207239}We'll talk about this.
{207245}{207349}I would've told you but you were away.|I had to make a last-minute decision.
{207355}{207414}I was fortunate to enter them at all.
{207420}{207532}They'll be the talk of the festival.|Imagine, seven children in one family!
{207538}{207586}Max!
{207592}{207660}Somehow I recall having made it|quite clear to you...
{207666}{207731}...how I feel about my family|singing in public!
{207737}{207777}The committee was enchanted.
{207783}{207859}- What did they say?|- I have never heard such enthusiasm.
{207865}{207968}- Don't you think just this once...?|- Absolutely out of the question.
{207974}{208076}- Georg, this is for Austria.|- For Austria?
{208082}{208159}- There is no Austria!|- But the Anschluss was peaceful.
{208165}{208285}- Let's at least be grateful for that.|- Grateful?
{208294}{208349}You know, Max...
{208355}{208468}...sometimes I don't believe|I know you.
{208497}{208544}Father, I forgot.
{208550}{208624}This is for you.
{208823}{208919}Maria, he has got to at least pretend|to work with these people.
{208925}{208961}You must convince him.
{208967}{209032}Max, I can't ask him|to be less than he is.
{209038}{209118}Then I'll talk to him.|If the children don't sing, well...
{209124}{209191}...it will be a reflection|on Austria.
{209197}{209314}Oh, I know.|It wouldn't do me any good either.
{209402}{209466}Mother? That sounds so nice.
{209472}{209537}- I like calling you "Mother".|- I like hearing it.
{209543}{209629}You love Father very much.|I can tell you do.
{209635}{209656}Very much.
{209662}{209752}Mother, what do you do when you|think you love someone?
{209758}{209921}I mean, when you stop loving someone|or he stops loving you?
{209948}{210002}Well, you cry a little.
{210008}{210059}Then you wait for the sun to come out.
{210065}{210098}It always does.
{210104}{210189}There are so many things I think|I should know but I don't.
{210195}{210242}- I really don't.|- How can you?
{210248}{210301}Sometimes I feel the world is ending.
{210307}{210382}- Then you feel it's just beginning?|- Yes!
{210388}{210501}It was that way with me. And for you|it will be just as wonderful.
{210507}{210568}Do you really think so?
{210574}{210669}{y:i}When you're 16 going on 17
{210675}{210771}{y:i}Waiting for life to start
{210777}{210869}{y:i}Somebody kind|{y:i}Who touches your mind
{210875}{210982}{y:i}Will suddenly touch your heart
{210988}{211033}{y:i}When that happens
{211039}{211086}{y:i}After it happens
{211092}{211184}{y:i}Nothing is quite the same
{211190}{211228}{y:i}Somehow I know
{211234}{211286}{y:i}I'll jump up and go
{211292}{211394}{y:i}If ever he calls my name
{211400}{211494}{y:i}Gone are your old ideas of life
{211500}{211601}{y:i}The old ideas grow dim
{211607}{211729}{y:i}Lo and behold|{y:i}You're someone's wife
{211735}{211879}{y:i}And you belong to him
{211885}{211988}{y:i}You may think this kind of adventure
{211994}{212106}{y:i}Never may come to you
{212112}{212256}{y:i}Darling, 16 going on 17
{212262}{212374}{y:i}Wait a year...
{212380}{212509}{y:i}- I'll wait a year|{y:i}...or two
{212515}{212707}{y:i}Just wait a year...
{212713}{212956}{y:i}... or two
{212978}{213052}Liesl.
{213410}{213459}What is it?
{213465}{213503}Berlin.
{213509}{213554}They've offered me a commission.
{213560}{213621}I've been requested|to accept immediately...
{213627}{213731}...and report to their naval base|at Bremerhaven tomorrow.
{213737}{213832}I knew this would happen.|I didn't think it would be so soon.
{213838}{213946}To refuse them would be fatal|for all of us.
{213952}{214079}And joining them would be unthinkable.
{214190}{214234}Get the children all together.
{214240}{214334}Don't say anything to worry them.|Just get them ready.
{214340}{214434}We've got to get out of Austria...
{214437}{214515}...and this house...
{214534}{214604}...tonight.
{215621}{215679}This strains my back|and breaks my heart...
{215685}{215753}...when I think of the children|missing the festival.
{215759}{215824}By your announcement|we'll be over the border.
{215830}{215887}Do you appreciate|the sacrifice I'm making?
{215893}{215924}You have no choice.
{215930}{216008}I know. That's why I'm making it.
{216014}{216065}Why doesn't Father turn the motor on?
{216071}{216189}Because he doesn't want anyone|to hear us.
{216239}{216299}What will Frau Schmidt and Franz say?
{216305}{216389}They'll be able to answer honestly|they didn't know anything.
{216395}{216496}- Will we be coming back here?|- Someday, Liesl. I do hope someday.
{216502}{216656}Are Father and Uncle Max going to push|the car all the way to Switzerland?
{217262}{217322}Something wrong|with your car, captain?
{217328}{217419}Yes, we couldn't get it started.
{217473}{217539}Karl.
{217550}{217669}Fix Captain von Trapp's car|so that it will start.
{218189}{218269}Excellent, Karl.
{218314}{218396}I've not asked you where you|and your family are going.
{218402}{218452}Nor have you asked me why I'm here.
{218458}{218563}Apparently we both suffer|from a deplorable lack of curiosity.
{218569}{218628}You never answered the telegram...
{218634}{218713}...from the Admiral of the Navy|of the Third Reich.
{218719}{218777}I was under the impression,|Herr Zeller...
{218783}{218879}...that the contents of telegrams|in Austria are private!
{218885}{218991}At least, the Austria I know.
{218997}{219036}I have my orders...
{219042}{219094}...to take you|to Bremerhaven tonight...
{219100}{219174}...where you will accept|your commission.
{219180}{219319}I'm afraid that's going to be|quite impossible.
{219325}{219374}You see, we...
{219380}{219468}...all of us, the entire family,|will be...
{219474}{219524}...singing in the festival tonight.
{219530}{219598}As a matter of fact, we're going now.
{219604}{219672}We couldn't possibly|let them down now.
{219678}{219749}- I just hope we're not too late.|- Yes.
{219755}{219824}You ask me to believe that you,|Captain von Trapp...
{219830}{219869}...are singing in a concert?
{219875}{219976}Believe me, it will be a performance|beyond anything even I've dreamt of.
{219982}{220104}Like you, Herr Zeller,|I, too, am a man of hidden talents.
{220110}{220143}Yes.
{220149}{220244}Here, program.
{220329}{220384}It says only the names|of the children.
{220390}{220469}It says|the von Trapp Family Singers...
{220475}{220584}...and I am the head of|the von Trapp family, am I not?
{220603}{220708}And these travel clothes|that you're all wearing?
{220714}{220751}Our costumes, naturally.
{220757}{220874}This night air is not good|for the children's voices.
{220988}{221096}Well, a slight delay in my orders|will not be serious.
{221102}{221153}Therefore...
{221159}{221214}...you will sing.
{221220}{221271}You will all sing.
{221277}{221353}But only because that's what I want.
{221359}{221454}It will demonstrate that nothing|in Austria has changed.
{221460}{221514}And when you have finished singing...
{221520}{221621}...you, Captain von Trapp, will be|taken to Bremerhaven.
{221627}{221692}Now, if you will all get|into your car...
{221698}{221804}...we will escort the von Trapp Family|Singers to the festival.
{221810}{221863}No escort will be necessary.
{221869}{221944}Necessary? A pleasure, captain.
{221950}{222066}After all, we would not want you|to get lost in the crowds.
{222072}{222118}Would we?
{222124}{222188}No.
{222539}{222616}{y:i}Sew, a needle pulling thread
{222622}{222699}{y:i}La, a note to follow sew
{222705}{222787}{y:i}Tea, a drink with jam and bread
{222793}{222884}{y:i}A drink with jam and bread
{222890}{222956}{y:i}Tea with jam, jam and bread
{222962}{223006}{y:i}Tea with jam and bread
{223012}{223108}{y:i}Jam and bread|{y:i}Tea with jam, jam and bread

{223307}{223386}{y:i}With jam|{y:i}A, B, C
{223392}{223469}{y:i}With jam|{y:i}Do-re-mi
{223475}{223561}{y:i}Tea with jam and bread
{223567}{223599}{y:i}With jam and bread
{223605}{223641}{y:i}With jam|{y:i}With jam...
{223647}{223859}{y:i}... and bread
{224384}{224486}My fellow Austrians...
{224492}{224628}...I shall not be seeing you again,|perhaps for a very long time.
{224634}{224706}I would like to sing for you now...
{224712}{224786}...a love song.
{224797}{224875}I know you share this love.
{224881}{225006}I pray that you will never let it die.
{225276}{225359}{y:i}Edelweiss
{225365}{225443}{y:i}Edelweiss
{225449}{225590}{y:i}Every morning you greet me
{225596}{225670}{y:i}Small and white
{225676}{225750}{y:i}Clean and bright
{225756}{225891}{y:i}You look happy to meet me
{225897}{225946}{y:i}Blossom of snow
{225952}{226038}{y:i}May you bloom and grow
{226044}{226209}{y:i}Bloom and grow forever

{227044}{227186}{y:i}You look happy to meet me
{227192}{227238}{y:i}Blossom of snow
{227244}{227336}{y:i}May you bloom and grow
{227342}{227491}{y:i}Bloom and grow forever
{227497}{227568}{y:i}Edelweiss
{227574}{227649}{y:i}Edelweiss
{227655}{227888}{y:i}Bless my homeland forever
{228277}{228326}I think it'll work.
{228332}{228380}I shall miss all of you.
{228386}{228481}I shall miss the money|I could have made with you.
{228527}{228576}Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.
{228582}{228646}The competition has come|to its conclusion...
{228652}{228744}...except, we don't know|yet what that conclusion will be.
{228750}{228811}And while the judges|arrive at their decision...
{228817}{228890}...I have been given permission|to offer you an encore.
{228896}{228973}This will be the last opportunity|the von Trapps will have...
{228979}{229056}...of singing together|for a long, long time.
{229062}{229158}Even now, officials are waiting|in this auditorium...
{229164}{229228}...to escort Captain von Trapp|to his new command...
{229234}{229319}...in the naval forces|of the Third Reich.
{229432}{229550}And so, ladies and gentlemen,|the family von Trapp again...
{229556}{229647}...to bid you farewell.
{229784}{229871}{y:i}There's a sad sort of clanging|{y:i}From the clock in the hall
{229877}{229963}{y:i}And the bells in the steeple too
{229969}{230061}{y:i}And up in the nursery|{y:i}An absurd little bird
{230067}{230124}{y:i}Is popping out to say "coo-coo"
{230130}{230170}{y:i}Coo-coo
{230176}{230200}{y:i}Coo-coo
{230206}{230244}{y:i}Regretfully they tell us
{230250}{230293}{y:i}But firmly they compel us
{230299}{230364}{y:i}To say goodbye
{230370}{230530}{y:i}To you
{230564}{230650}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, good night
{230656}{230782}{y:i}We hate to go|{y:i}And miss this pretty sight
{230894}{230979}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, adieu
{230985}{231109}{y:i}Adieu, adieu|{y:i}To you and you and you
{231224}{231309}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
{231315}{231354}{y:i}We flit, we float
{231360}{231438}{y:i}We fleetly flee, we fly
{231554}{231644}{y:i}So long, farewell|{y:i}Auf Wiedersehen, goodbye
{231650}{231731}{y:i}The sun has gone to bed|{y:i}And so must I
{231737}{231828}{y:i}Goodbye
{231834}{231970}{y:i}Goodbye
{231976}{232101}{y:i}Goodbye
{232107}{232315}{y:i}Goodbye
{233040}{233139}Ladies and gentlemen, I have here the|decision of our distinguished judges.
{233145}{233216}We will start with the award|for third prize.
{233222}{233278}For this honor,|the judges have named...
{233284}{233395}...the first soloist of the choir|of St. Agatha's Church in Murback.
{233401}{233491}Frulein Schweiger.
{234339}{234470}Second prize|to The Toby Reiser Quintet.
{235105}{235205}And the first prize,|the highest honor in all Austria...
{235211}{235322}...the von Trapp Family Singers.
{235581}{235659}The family von Trapp.
{235972}{236034}They're gone!
{236446}{236479}Come with me.
{236572}{236636}Quickly, quickly.
{236642}{236706}I have a place you can hide.
{236712}{236827}Slowly, slowly.
{237054}{237116}Open this gate.
{237122}{237196}Good evening.
{237220}{237292}Hurry up, woman.
{237731}{237759}Two men in there.
{237765}{237809}Six of you cover the yard.
{237815}{237906}You two, cover the corridor.
{238217}{238303}Reverend Mother, we didn't realize|we put the abbey in this danger.
{238309}{238369}No, Maria, it was right for you|to come here.
{238375}{238419}We thought we might borrow|your car.
{238425}{238479}I'm afraid our car will do you|no good now.
{238485}{238524}I've been listening to the wires.
{238530}{238626}The borders have just been closed.
{238731}{238810}All right,|if the borders are closed...
{238816}{238904}...then we'll drive up into the hills|and go over the mountains on foot.
{238910}{238958}- The children...|- We'll help them.
{238964}{239036}We can do it without help, Father.
{239042}{239085}Maria.
{239091}{239154}You will not be alone.|Remember:
{239160}{239252}"I will lift up mine eyes unto|the hills from whence cometh my help".
{239258}{239311}Yes, Mother.
{239317}{239405}- I'm scared.|- Me too.
{239659}{239723}God be with you.
{239853}{239890}- Mother.|- Yes?
{239896}{239973}Would it help if we sang|about our favorite things?
{239979}{240051}No, darling.|This is one time it would not help.
{240057}{240170}You must be very quiet.|Hold tight to me.
{243362}{243427}Let's try the roof.
{244740}{244831}Rolf, please.
{244916}{244990}No, wait.
{245187}{245240}Maria.
{245246}{245316}Children.
{245377}{245453}It's you we want, not them.
{245459}{245520}Put that down.
{245526}{245641}Not another move,|or I'll shoot.
{245646}{245731}You're only a boy.
{245767}{245891}- You don't really belong to them.|- Stay where you are.
{245897}{245969}Come away with us.
{245975}{246011}Before it's too late.
{246017}{246109}Not another step.|I'll kill you.
{246128}{246226}- You give that to me, Rolf.|- Did you hear me?
{246232}{246306}I'll kill you.
{246315}{246387}Rolf.
{246790}{246860}You'll never be one of them.
{246889}{246930}Lieutenant!
{246936}{246962}They're here!
{246968}{247004}They're here, lieutenant!
{247996}{248061}Reverend Mother.
{248067}{248133}I have sinned.
{248139}{248226}I too, Reverend Mother.
{248230}{248321}What is this sin, my children?
