1
00:00:53,592 --> 00:00:58,964
Date: 13th Day of May, 1630

2
00:00:58,965 --> 00:01:00,864
Weather: Fair

3
00:01:00,933 --> 00:01:04,926
The heat of day rises hourly

4
00:01:05,571 --> 00:01:09,439
10 am: Hon. Heir Bennosuke

5
00:01:10,042 --> 00:01:14,172
departs bearing fresh river trout

6
00:01:14,446 --> 00:01:18,439
for presentation to the hon. Lord Doi

7
00:01:19,051 --> 00:01:22,578
at His Lordship's mansion

8
00:01:22,688 --> 00:01:26,658
No incidents worthy of note

9
00:01:26,659 --> 00:01:28,148
However,

10
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:30,751
around midday

11
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:37,260
an ex-warrior, formerly in the service of
the Lord of Geishu,

12
00:01:37,336 --> 00:01:40,794
appeared at our gate.

13
00:01:57,689 --> 00:02:04,652
HARAKIRI/SEPPUKU

14
00:03:59,478 --> 00:04:01,639
Official residence of Lord Iyi

15
00:04:10,622 --> 00:04:15,389
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu?

16
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,189
Correct!

17
00:04:17,262 --> 00:04:21,858
And my names is Hanshiro Tsugumo

18
00:04:21,933 --> 00:04:25,630
Tsu as in Ohtsu

19
00:04:25,704 --> 00:04:29,470
Gumo for clouds in the sky

20
00:04:29,541 --> 00:04:32,977
And your errand here?

21
00:04:33,044 --> 00:04:37,981
My lord's downfall came about in 1619

22
00:04:38,049 --> 00:04:41,348
I have since moved to Edo

23
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:46,653
and have managed to make a meager living

24
00:04:46,725 --> 00:04:52,186
while seeking employed under a new master

25
00:04:53,064 --> 00:04:57,160
But in such times of peace, all was in vain

26
00:04:57,235 --> 00:05:00,568
and my hopes are crushed

27
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,077
The years passed unrewarded

28
00:05:06,144 --> 00:05:11,548
and lacking means of subsistence,
life has become intolerable

29
00:05:11,616 --> 00:05:16,485
Rather than live on in dire poverty and disgrace

30
00:05:16,555 --> 00:05:20,616
He would die honorably by hara-kiri

31
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:26,153
He begs use of a corner of this mansion
for the ritual

32
00:05:26,231 --> 00:05:28,893
Such is his request

33
00:05:30,836 --> 00:05:34,272
Another one?

34
00:05:34,339 --> 00:05:37,570
Is there no end?

35
00:05:38,376 --> 00:05:41,140
And your wish, sire?

36
00:05:44,382 --> 00:05:47,010
Good! I'll see him

37
00:06:47,546 --> 00:06:54,611
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu,

38
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:58,349
I am Hanshiro Tsugumo

39
00:06:58,423 --> 00:07:02,223
I respectfully beg your favors

40
00:07:02,294 --> 00:07:06,526
Clan Elder of the House of Iyi, Kageyu Saito

41
00:07:06,598 --> 00:07:11,092
I am indebted to you for this interview

42
00:07:11,269 --> 00:07:12,736
My purpose here...

43
00:07:12,804 --> 00:07:16,399
I am fully informed

44
00:07:16,474 --> 00:07:19,671
Rather than to live on in dire poverty,

45
00:07:19,744 --> 00:07:24,113
You prefer to die honorably

46
00:07:24,182 --> 00:07:26,548
by hara-kiri

47
00:07:26,618 --> 00:07:29,143
Is that not so?

48
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,484
Correct!

49
00:07:31,556 --> 00:07:36,425
Truly a most worthy turn of mind

50
00:07:36,494 --> 00:07:40,954
I am greatly impressed

51
00:07:41,032 --> 00:07:46,629
You mentioned having served
the former Lord of Geishu

52
00:07:46,705 --> 00:07:51,039
Did You know Motome Chijiiwa?

53
00:07:51,109 --> 00:07:53,942
Chijiiwa?

54
00:07:54,012 --> 00:07:57,072
You don't remember?

55
00:07:59,417 --> 00:08:02,045
He also served the Lord of Geishu

56
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:06,955
In its day, the Geishu Clan counted
some 12,000 retainers

57
00:08:07,025 --> 00:08:10,756
I regret to say...

58
00:08:10,829 --> 00:08:18,895
Indeed? But that is a minor matter

59
00:08:19,371 --> 00:08:26,539
Early this year... possibly the end of January...

60
00:08:26,611 --> 00:08:31,173
An ex-warrior... a Motome Chijiiwa...
came to this mansion

61
00:08:31,249 --> 00:08:34,810
On a mission identical to yours

62
00:08:34,886 --> 00:08:40,290
He also begged permission to perform hara-kiri

63
00:08:47,899 --> 00:08:53,360
Are you interested in how he fared?

64
00:08:54,506 --> 00:08:56,497
I am listening

65
00:08:56,775 --> 00:09:02,145
A former retainer of the Lord of Geishu?

66
00:09:02,213 --> 00:09:07,446
That is correct! Former retainer of the Clan

67
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,011
And known as Motome Chijiiwa

68
00:09:11,089 --> 00:09:14,616
And... your errand?

69
00:09:14,693 --> 00:09:21,496
Abolition of our Clan led me to
seek humble quarters in Edo

70
00:09:21,566 --> 00:09:24,558
Here I have managed to subsist

71
00:09:24,636 --> 00:09:29,801
while waiting to serve a new master

72
00:09:29,874 --> 00:09:37,610
But in a world of peace there is no hope

73
00:09:47,859 --> 00:09:51,454
I expected this

74
00:09:53,898 --> 00:09:55,490
And... what would you do?

75
00:09:55,567 --> 00:09:58,229
Let me see...

76
00:09:59,571 --> 00:10:02,802
A truly deplorable state...

77
00:10:02,874 --> 00:10:05,570
The Sengoku Clan erred

78
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,611
They set the precedent

79
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:10,409
No... I don't agree

80
00:10:10,482 --> 00:10:12,040
Why not?

81
00:10:12,484 --> 00:10:17,786
The ex-warrior who entered the
Sengoku mansion was sincere

82
00:10:17,856 --> 00:10:22,020
He intended to die

83
00:10:22,093 --> 00:10:24,527
And touched by his sincerity

84
00:10:24,596 --> 00:10:27,258
the Clan took him in as a back-room retainer

85
00:10:27,332 --> 00:10:34,295
They did not err! They did right

86
00:10:34,939 --> 00:10:41,174
It is the others who copy him,
who cast such shame on us

87
00:10:41,246 --> 00:10:44,215
Far from wishing to die, they merely
seek material aid

88
00:10:44,282 --> 00:10:49,777
They are but common extortioners!

89
00:10:49,854 --> 00:10:51,788
You prefer to die honorably

90
00:10:51,856 --> 00:10:55,292
to die at our door

91
00:10:55,360 --> 00:11:01,765
Offer him a pittance to go his way as
do the other clans

92
00:11:02,467 --> 00:11:06,494
No... that would never do!

93
00:11:08,239 --> 00:11:10,707
Offer coins to one

94
00:11:10,775 --> 00:11:13,767
and others will soon flock to our door

95
00:11:13,845 --> 00:11:21,342
They will pour forth like ants to a mound of
sweet sugar

96
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:27,355
Following the end of civil war,
the land abounds with ex-warrior

97
00:11:27,425 --> 00:11:32,920
Scrambling for food like animals!

98
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:37,958
The House of Iyi is blunt-witted

99
00:11:39,737 --> 00:11:41,864
Their reputation for grit and moral fibber

100
00:11:41,940 --> 00:11:47,970
Once sufficed to keep ex-warrior away

101
00:11:50,215 --> 00:11:52,979
But... now?

102
00:11:53,051 --> 00:12:01,823
Even pride in the martial arts is a thing of
the past...

103
00:12:03,027 --> 00:12:06,758
swept away by years of peaceful living

104
00:12:06,831 --> 00:12:09,766
Such would be the rumors circulated
throughout the land

105
00:12:09,834 --> 00:12:11,961
His Lordship absent

106
00:12:12,036 --> 00:12:16,803
and such harmful rumors spreading in
his absence...

107
00:12:16,875 --> 00:12:19,776
It must never be!

108
00:12:19,844 --> 00:12:23,439
Bribery to send him packing has
never crossed my mind

109
00:12:23,514 --> 00:12:28,451
Without the least intention of dying

110
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:34,253
he dares pretend...

111
00:12:34,325 --> 00:12:36,691
Hon. Elder!

112
00:12:39,530 --> 00:12:41,760
Allow me...

113
00:13:10,194 --> 00:13:12,253
Your pardon...

114
00:13:21,172 --> 00:13:25,541
His Lordship's retainer... Umenosuke Kawabe

115
00:13:25,610 --> 00:13:29,603
Motome Chijiiwa... ex-warrior of Geishu

116
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:32,548
And now... kindly come with me

117
00:13:34,285 --> 00:13:37,083
To the bath-room

118
00:13:41,025 --> 00:13:44,392
In his Lordship's absence

119
00:13:44,462 --> 00:13:51,026
the hon. Elder reported your plight to our hon.
Heir, Bennosuke

120
00:13:51,102 --> 00:13:57,439
Our young master is deeply moved and
wishes a word with you

121
00:13:58,276 --> 00:14:03,578
I am allowed an interview with the hon.
Heir, Bennosuke?

122
00:14:03,648 --> 00:14:05,582
That is correct

123
00:14:06,651 --> 00:14:12,817
However... those clothes will not do

124
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,825
First you must bathe

125
00:14:15,893 --> 00:14:20,660
Proper dress is being prepared for you

126
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:24,293
I am in your hands

127
00:14:24,369 --> 00:14:26,633
I am overwhelmed

128
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:46,087
Incredible! Am I dreaming?

129
00:14:46,324 --> 00:14:50,693
Not only inconceivable... it's...

130
00:14:50,862 --> 00:14:53,092
Your pardon!

131
00:15:05,043 --> 00:15:08,069
Forgive the unexpected delay

132
00:15:09,814 --> 00:15:13,306
You must change now

133
00:15:13,551 --> 00:15:15,883
To death robes

134
00:15:45,249 --> 00:15:47,217
You're shocked?

135
00:15:47,285 --> 00:15:51,221
Was I not to see your hon. Heir?

136
00:15:53,458 --> 00:15:56,723
He has expressed such a desire

137
00:15:56,794 --> 00:16:00,355
Odd! It must be a misunderstanding

138
00:16:00,431 --> 00:16:02,865
It's not!

139
00:16:02,934 --> 00:16:06,870
The hon. Umenosuke Kawabe passed me
the information...

140
00:16:06,938 --> 00:16:10,874
Oh? Hon. Kawabe did?

141
00:16:11,175 --> 00:16:18,308
I begin to understand... yes... it could be possible

142
00:16:18,983 --> 00:16:23,044
Then... you know about it?

143
00:16:23,121 --> 00:16:25,715
Yes, it becomes quite clear

144
00:16:28,025 --> 00:16:35,625
The hon. Elder reported your plight
to our hon. Heir

145
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:39,033
who was deeply moved by your courage

146
00:16:39,103 --> 00:16:44,598
and wished to make you one of us

147
00:16:45,276 --> 00:16:50,908
However... a samurai resolved to
performing hara-kiri

148
00:16:50,982 --> 00:16:56,284
must be one of unwavering will

149
00:16:56,354 --> 00:16:59,915
As nothing can alter his decision,

150
00:16:59,991 --> 00:17:04,792
allow him his final wish...

151
00:17:04,996 --> 00:17:10,332
I would readily spare the time for
a word with him

152
00:17:10,401 --> 00:17:15,202
but Lord Doi requests my attendance

153
00:17:15,273 --> 00:17:19,107
Extend him all courtesies of my house

154
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:24,308
and have my men witness the ritual

155
00:17:24,382 --> 00:17:27,317
Let it be a proud example

156
00:17:27,385 --> 00:17:32,550
Such were his words... as told to me

157
00:17:47,972 --> 00:17:51,567
Well? Did you enjoy it?

158
00:17:51,642 --> 00:17:54,509
A most interesting story

159
00:17:54,579 --> 00:18:02,281
A tale befitting the valiant traditions
of the House of Iyi

160
00:18:02,653 --> 00:18:06,817
And... what are your intentions?

161
00:18:06,891 --> 00:18:12,887
Oh... you are referring to this?

162
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:15,296
Exactly!

163
00:18:18,836 --> 00:18:21,464
Be not concerned...

164
00:18:21,539 --> 00:18:26,670
I came here with this avowed purpose in mind

165
00:18:26,744 --> 00:18:29,212
Most laudable!

166
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,979
I commend you on your unwavering decision

167
00:18:35,653 --> 00:18:38,486
Hon. Tsugumo

168
00:18:38,556 --> 00:18:45,052
Perhaps I should continue my story
about this Motome Chijiiwa

169
00:18:45,763 --> 00:18:46,957
I am listening

170
00:18:48,032 --> 00:18:50,023
Come... time is fleeting!

171
00:18:50,101 --> 00:18:54,561
You must change your robes

172
00:18:54,639 --> 00:19:00,544
All preparations have been completed for
your hara-kiri ritual

173
00:19:05,616 --> 00:19:07,948
I beg a boon!

174
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:11,819
A boon... allow me a little time!

175
00:19:14,525 --> 00:19:16,755
I won't run!

176
00:19:16,827 --> 00:19:18,818
I promise to return here

177
00:19:18,896 --> 00:19:22,297
Just a few days!

178
00:19:23,067 --> 00:19:25,934
It's too late

179
00:19:26,270 --> 00:19:27,862
It's unjustified!

180
00:19:28,005 --> 00:19:33,102
Was it not at your request

181
00:19:33,177 --> 00:19:35,441
that we made arrangements?

182
00:19:35,513 --> 00:19:39,779
I beg your forgiveness! Just a day or tow...

183
00:19:39,850 --> 00:19:42,011
I will return!

184
00:19:42,286 --> 00:19:47,588
A Samurai's word is sacred. It cannot be!

185
00:20:29,633 --> 00:20:33,831
Our master swordsman,
Hayato Yazaki Young...is eager for action!

186
00:20:33,904 --> 00:20:40,776
One move... you'll be ripped open!

187
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:53,485
And there are others...

188
00:20:53,557 --> 00:20:56,583
Rather than be chopped up like some dead fish

189
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:00,391
die in honor...

190
00:21:00,464 --> 00:21:02,091
Come... you must change robes

191
00:21:32,797 --> 00:21:36,824
Heed me, hon. Ancestors!

192
00:21:36,901 --> 00:21:41,497
Forgive the unworthy ex-warrior

193
00:21:41,572 --> 00:21:44,564
which defiles our sacred garden

194
00:21:57,988 --> 00:22:05,292
The family honor is at stake

195
00:22:05,362 --> 00:22:11,858
the future of the Tokugawa Clan and
our sacred Samurai Code

196
00:22:11,936 --> 00:22:15,838
I beg you be witness to my decision!

197
00:23:01,218 --> 00:23:03,686
Both blades?

198
00:23:03,988 --> 00:23:05,478
It's useless!

199
00:23:06,023 --> 00:23:10,357
Such a blade couldn't slash a radish!

200
00:23:11,328 --> 00:23:13,694
A samurai's blade is his soul!

201
00:23:13,764 --> 00:23:16,198
Blade of bamboo...

202
00:23:16,267 --> 00:23:18,735
And his is to die by hara-kiri?

203
00:23:19,069 --> 00:23:21,663
A shameless wretch!

204
00:23:24,642 --> 00:23:27,668
All is now ready

205
00:23:43,961 --> 00:23:46,657
Motome Chijiiwa...

206
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:51,993
Rather than live in dishonor,

207
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,800
you have chosen to die by hara-kiri

208
00:23:55,873 --> 00:23:58,740
A most commendable wish

209
00:23:58,809 --> 00:24:04,213
An end befitting a true warrior

210
00:24:04,281 --> 00:24:09,514
I am shamed to admit that even this House
with its proud traditions

211
00:24:09,587 --> 00:24:17,016
boasts very few men of such integrity

212
00:24:18,362 --> 00:24:22,423
To witness this most unique rite

213
00:24:22,499 --> 00:24:29,371
all the retainers of this house hold
have been gathered here

214
00:24:31,041 --> 00:24:36,274
Go your way... with heart at peace

215
00:24:38,048 --> 00:24:39,879
A boon, sire!

216
00:24:40,517 --> 00:24:42,246
Oh? What is it?

217
00:24:42,319 --> 00:24:47,347
A day or two of grace... I implore you!

218
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:51,249
I seek not to escape! I will return

219
00:24:51,328 --> 00:24:54,320
I beg you... implore you!

220
00:24:55,566 --> 00:24:58,558
An odd request, indeed!

221
00:24:58,636 --> 00:25:02,402
I have been informed that Edo abounds
with ex-warrior who disgrace our class

222
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:06,375
by threatening to perform hara-kiri at one's gate

223
00:25:06,443 --> 00:25:11,938
unless a pittance is offered them

224
00:25:12,016 --> 00:25:18,819
Don't tell me... you...

225
00:25:19,823 --> 00:25:22,917
No... I would never...

226
00:25:22,993 --> 00:25:27,327
Yes... I'm sure you wouldn't

227
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,958
A man of your lofty character would be,

228
00:25:30,034 --> 00:25:36,906
incapable of such disreputable action

229
00:25:37,307 --> 00:25:41,175
Now... feel free to proceed!

230
00:25:57,227 --> 00:26:01,596
This unworthy will be your second

231
00:26:02,066 --> 00:26:06,230
Exponent of the Shindo-Munen School

232
00:26:10,007 --> 00:26:14,967
Though words be unnecessary, I would explain

233
00:26:15,045 --> 00:26:19,914
The rite of hara-kiri has changed with the years

234
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:23,510
Of late, this sacred ritual

235
00:26:23,587 --> 00:26:26,988
has fallen into idle formalism

236
00:26:27,057 --> 00:26:31,551
The victim no sooner reaches for his blade,

237
00:26:31,628 --> 00:26:34,893
than he is beheaded

238
00:26:34,965 --> 00:26:36,592
No disembowelment is involved

239
00:26:36,667 --> 00:26:39,795
In some cases, a fan is placed on the tray

240
00:26:39,870 --> 00:26:42,862
instead of a blade

241
00:26:43,273 --> 00:26:48,006
Today, however, no shabby imitation

242
00:26:48,078 --> 00:26:51,241
of this sacred rite will be tolerated

243
00:26:51,315 --> 00:26:55,376
All will proceed in traditional form

244
00:26:57,121 --> 00:26:59,351
Understand?

245
00:27:00,090 --> 00:27:05,722
Like this... you will open your bowels crosswise!

246
00:27:06,296 --> 00:27:11,757
Only then will I undertake to execute my duty

247
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:19,867
I act only when disembowelment is to
our satisfaction

248
00:27:19,943 --> 00:27:22,207
Is that clear?

249
00:27:22,279 --> 00:27:24,076
Proceed!

250
00:27:59,983 --> 00:28:04,477
It is your blade... and you die by it

251
00:28:06,957 --> 00:28:11,121
A samurai's blade is his soul

252
00:28:11,361 --> 00:28:15,889
What blade could be more appropriate?

253
00:28:46,129 --> 00:28:49,690
Well... what keeps you?

254
00:28:51,068 --> 00:28:53,366
Please, proceed

255
00:30:10,347 --> 00:30:11,746
Strike!

256
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:26,389
Behead me!

257
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:31,192
Not yet! Slash open your bowels

258
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:56,688
Why stops? Pull your blade!

259
00:30:56,760 --> 00:30:58,887
To the right!

260
00:31:45,876 --> 00:31:49,471
Yes... even as a final resort...

261
00:31:49,546 --> 00:31:51,844
to bite off one's own tongue...

262
00:31:51,915 --> 00:31:53,542
A praiseworthy...

263
00:31:53,617 --> 00:31:56,347
yet disgraceful act!

264
00:31:56,420 --> 00:32:04,122
And after all... he threatened with
only bearing blades of bamboo

265
00:32:06,163 --> 00:32:12,033
By the way... what are your intentions?

266
00:32:14,538 --> 00:32:19,908
I assume you are referring to this?

267
00:32:22,446 --> 00:32:30,979
The fate of this hapless youth was
exactly as I related it

268
00:32:31,721 --> 00:32:38,650
Hon. Tsugumo... heed my advice and reconsider

269
00:32:38,728 --> 00:32:43,131
No. No! Set your mind at ease on that score

270
00:32:44,167 --> 00:32:48,194
Unlike this youthful Chijiiwa,

271
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,867
neither of my blades are of bamboo

272
00:32:53,944 --> 00:32:56,242
I will perform the ritual

273
00:32:56,313 --> 00:33:02,616
without biting off my tongue

274
00:33:04,588 --> 00:33:06,556
Enough!

275
00:33:06,723 --> 00:33:10,989
Hon. Tsugumo... at your insistence,

276
00:33:11,061 --> 00:33:13,154
I grant you your wish

277
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:14,754
Attendant!

278
00:33:20,403 --> 00:33:24,100
Hanshiro Tsugumo, ex-warrior of Geishu,

279
00:33:24,174 --> 00:33:28,474
seeks to die by hara-kiri

280
00:33:29,913 --> 00:33:35,351
As his dress is inappropriate,
he is to be supplied with robes...

281
00:33:35,418 --> 00:33:36,851
What is it?

282
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,684
Such considerations are unwanted

283
00:33:39,756 --> 00:33:48,130
My present attire most befits a
destitute ex-warrior

284
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:52,794
headed for the next world

285
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:16,086
For the considerate treatment
extended me this day

286
00:34:16,159 --> 00:34:19,151
I am deeply grateful

287
00:34:19,229 --> 00:34:23,928
Hanshiro Tsugumo fails to find words to
thank you

288
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:27,265
Now... I proceed

289
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:37,570
Incidentally, hon. Elder... who will be
acting as my second?

290
00:34:39,015 --> 00:34:43,281
Ichiro Shinmen has been selected

291
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,859
You have a preference?

292
00:34:53,930 --> 00:35:00,233
Yes... I would request the services of hon.
Hikokuro Omodake

293
00:35:00,303 --> 00:35:02,464
Hikokuro Omodake

294
00:35:02,539 --> 00:35:09,672
His fame as a Shindo-Munen School
swordsman precedes him

295
00:35:09,746 --> 00:35:15,150
True! Hikokuro has won wide acclaim

296
00:35:15,218 --> 00:35:17,152
Hikokuro...

297
00:35:19,689 --> 00:35:23,989
Omodaka has absented himself today

298
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:28,895
He has sent in a formal request for
4 or 5 days of rest

299
00:35:28,965 --> 00:35:33,061
Indeed? Then it cannot be helped

300
00:35:33,136 --> 00:35:37,664
Hon. Tsugumo... as you have just heard,

301
00:35:37,741 --> 00:35:40,505
Omodaka is not present

302
00:35:41,011 --> 00:35:43,343
Any other choice?

303
00:35:43,413 --> 00:35:47,611
Hmm... most disappointing!

304
00:35:49,052 --> 00:35:53,182
I had looked forward to hon.
Omodaka acting as my second

305
00:35:53,256 --> 00:35:57,784
Could I not beg his special attendance?

306
00:35:58,895 --> 00:36:04,993
Yes... perhaps. His fatigue was not
too noticeable yesterday

307
00:36:05,068 --> 00:36:08,162
It couldn't be serious

308
00:36:09,506 --> 00:36:11,167
Attendant!

309
00:36:20,550 --> 00:36:22,745
Go seek out Omodaka and inform him

310
00:36:22,819 --> 00:36:27,779
that I wish his attendance

311
00:36:27,857 --> 00:36:29,791
Go now... hurry!

312
00:36:36,866 --> 00:36:41,064
I am indebted to you for your kind consideration

313
00:36:42,672 --> 00:36:47,268
And now... will you await him here?

314
00:36:47,777 --> 00:36:49,904
Or will you come inside?

315
00:36:49,979 --> 00:36:53,710
To re-enter your mansion

316
00:36:53,783 --> 00:36:56,775
may cause my determination to waver

317
00:36:56,853 --> 00:37:03,782
My pending journey might become distasteful

318
00:37:04,127 --> 00:37:07,062
I will wait here

319
00:37:07,564 --> 00:37:11,694
Your grim determination is awe-inspiring

320
00:37:12,302 --> 00:37:14,463
Hon. Elder

321
00:37:15,271 --> 00:37:19,901
There is nothing to be gained from
tedious waiting

322
00:37:21,878 --> 00:37:27,407
Allow me to relate my life story to
pass the time

323
00:37:27,851 --> 00:37:33,255
Oh? The story of your life?

324
00:37:33,623 --> 00:37:40,324
Yes. The life story of an impoverished
ex-warrior may sound boring

325
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:43,366
but my fate here today

326
00:37:43,433 --> 00:37:47,335
may be the fate of others tomorrow

327
00:37:48,304 --> 00:37:52,900
Those who heed my tale

328
00:37:52,976 --> 00:37:54,637
may even find

329
00:37:54,711 --> 00:37:58,704
certain gems of wisdom hidden therein

330
00:37:59,048 --> 00:38:03,883
Your fate today... another's tomorrow?

331
00:38:08,625 --> 00:38:11,958
Yes... sounds interesting!

332
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:19,159
Heed well his final words

333
00:38:19,235 --> 00:38:23,763
The words of a man heading for Eternity

334
00:38:24,174 --> 00:38:27,974
This is no ordinary testament

335
00:38:28,778 --> 00:38:32,714
There is much to be gained from it

336
00:38:34,284 --> 00:38:36,752
Hon. Elder...

337
00:38:41,524 --> 00:38:50,057
The tale you related earlier is complete
with all truths and facts?

338
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:56,296
It is

339
00:38:57,707 --> 00:39:02,041
The Geishu ex-warrior, Motome Chijiiwa,

340
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:06,104
was a lad of some slight acquaintance

341
00:39:24,901 --> 00:39:28,530
Motome Chijiiwa...

342
00:39:29,472 --> 00:39:34,842
Yes... a lad of some slight acquaintance

343
00:40:11,748 --> 00:40:16,242
Motome was a handsome youth of 15

344
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:21,450
And my daughter, Miho, a child of 11

345
00:40:21,524 --> 00:40:24,618
Eleven years ago...

346
00:40:25,562 --> 00:40:28,690
Yet... I close my eyes

347
00:40:28,765 --> 00:40:35,500
and it all comes back to me as if it
were only yesterday

348
00:40:54,624 --> 00:40:55,215
Another round?

349
00:40:55,291 --> 00:40:57,452
Why bother?

350
00:40:57,527 --> 00:41:00,655
Our duty is to rebuild

351
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:03,255
Archery will not help us

352
00:41:03,333 --> 00:41:08,669
Oh, peace... wonderful peace!

353
00:41:09,472 --> 00:41:15,468
By the way, the 22nd is the 7th anniversary
of my wife's death

354
00:41:15,545 --> 00:41:19,003
Oh? I remember the date...

355
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:20,709
but the 7th already?

356
00:41:20,783 --> 00:41:25,516
Yes... and I plan a small ceremony at
my residence

357
00:41:25,588 --> 00:41:27,579
But not offerings...

358
00:41:27,657 --> 00:41:29,284
I understand

359
00:41:29,359 --> 00:41:34,456
But I can hardly believe it! Seven years?

360
00:41:35,898 --> 00:41:39,459
And what is more,

361
00:41:39,535 --> 00:41:43,437
a war-scarred veteran like you

362
00:41:43,506 --> 00:41:45,974
bringing up that charming child all by yourself.

363
00:41:46,042 --> 00:41:50,411
You... it's the other way around!

364
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,247
When hon. Yuki died,

365
00:41:55,318 --> 00:41:59,721
I wondered how you'd manage

366
00:41:59,789 --> 00:42:02,883
And yet... look at you...

367
00:42:02,959 --> 00:42:05,325
a perfect kite-hawk combination!

368
00:42:05,395 --> 00:42:09,729
The widowed kite puttering about
bringing up his young one

369
00:42:09,799 --> 00:42:11,528
Only to find his young

370
00:42:11,601 --> 00:42:14,627
grown into a princely hawk!

371
00:42:14,704 --> 00:42:16,501
A fine young hawk!

372
00:42:16,572 --> 00:42:18,403
Nonsense!

373
00:42:18,875 --> 00:42:22,402
He grows up only in body

374
00:42:22,478 --> 00:42:27,245
A far cry from the noble hawks
soaring overhead

375
00:42:28,418 --> 00:42:31,581
You know... I always felt

376
00:42:31,654 --> 00:42:34,088
I'd be of no use off the battlefield

377
00:42:34,290 --> 00:42:37,123
but somehow I've managed

378
00:42:44,467 --> 00:42:47,163
Had life gone on thus,

379
00:42:47,236 --> 00:42:50,103
all would have been well

380
00:42:51,474 --> 00:42:55,570
But not our life!

381
00:42:56,479 --> 00:42:58,379
Our lives are like unto houses

382
00:42:59,949 --> 00:43:04,045
built on foundations of sand

383
00:43:04,120 --> 00:43:07,556
An ill wind means the end

384
00:43:09,592 --> 00:43:16,293
What brought about the downfall of
Milord's vast Geishu domain?

385
00:43:17,700 --> 00:43:19,565
Need I go into details?

386
00:43:19,635 --> 00:43:22,229
You must all be informed

387
00:43:24,774 --> 00:43:27,971
Repairs on Hiroshima Castle were construed

388
00:43:28,044 --> 00:43:32,174
as a threat to the Tokugawa Shogunate

389
00:43:33,516 --> 00:43:36,144
In June of 1619...

390
00:43:36,419 --> 00:43:40,412
Our master's domain was abolished

391
00:43:40,490 --> 00:43:45,792
and 12,000 innocent retainers of his household

392
00:43:45,862 --> 00:43:49,059
were suddenly deprived of means of livelihood

393
00:44:20,630 --> 00:44:22,723
Jinnai!

394
00:44:34,010 --> 00:44:36,240
The Hon. Hanshiro Tsugumo

395
00:44:36,312 --> 00:44:39,907
Final requests to my friend of long standing:

396
00:44:40,216 --> 00:44:45,176
Demise of the hon.
Castle Repairs Commissioner

397
00:44:45,254 --> 00:44:49,588
is expected at any moment

398
00:44:49,659 --> 00:44:54,323
I precede him on this final journey

399
00:44:54,397 --> 00:44:58,356
my attendance alone will suffice

400
00:44:58,434 --> 00:45:02,996
I beg you to refrain

401
00:45:03,072 --> 00:45:06,473
But my son,

402
00:45:06,542 --> 00:45:11,343
Motome is yet a mere child of 15 years

403
00:45:11,514 --> 00:45:14,711
I beg for him your future guidance

404
00:45:27,930 --> 00:45:33,391
Impatient one! Could he not have
waited for me?

405
00:45:33,469 --> 00:45:37,200
Hanshiro... I forbid you!

406
00:45:37,273 --> 00:45:41,107
You are not to join me

407
00:45:41,177 --> 00:45:44,271
it is all so meaningless!

408
00:45:45,948 --> 00:45:48,178
Jinnai is enough!

409
00:45:48,251 --> 00:45:51,243
Be not imprudent!

410
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:56,019
Jinnai died first to forest all
any attempts by you

411
00:45:56,859 --> 00:46:00,488
He accompanies me on your behalf

412
00:46:00,563 --> 00:46:05,865
And now, Hanshiro,

413
00:46:05,935 --> 00:46:07,425
it is your duty to carry on

414
00:46:07,503 --> 00:46:09,095
To take over for him...

415
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:17,643
Who else is there to look after his son,
Motome?

416
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:28,116
Masakatsu now goes to meet Jinnai

417
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:33,890
Hanshiro... have you no message for
your friend, Jinnai?

418
00:46:36,332 --> 00:46:39,563
No message for Jinnai?

419
00:46:39,635 --> 00:46:44,231
Inform Jinnai... just inform him...

420
00:46:47,643 --> 00:46:54,071
The future and destiny of his son,
Motome Chijiiwa

421
00:46:54,150 --> 00:47:00,111
Are watched over and protected by
Hanshiro... with his life!

422
00:47:01,257 --> 00:47:05,353
Hon. Tsugumo

423
00:47:09,799 --> 00:47:10,766
Well?

424
00:47:18,107 --> 00:47:19,506
How did you fare?

425
00:47:20,443 --> 00:47:23,844
Sire... he seems gravely afflicted

426
00:47:23,913 --> 00:47:26,177
And what malady ails him?

427
00:47:26,248 --> 00:47:33,177
His family reports that he suffers high fever
and much acute pain

428
00:47:33,255 --> 00:47:37,817
I begged to visit his bed-side

429
00:47:37,893 --> 00:47:40,987
but he suffers such great pain

430
00:47:41,063 --> 00:47:44,726
that they would not allow it

431
00:47:44,800 --> 00:47:48,531
I departed upon leaving your message

432
00:47:48,604 --> 00:47:51,630
Then we have no choice

433
00:47:51,707 --> 00:47:54,073
This sultry weather...

434
00:47:54,143 --> 00:47:57,237
it must have afflicted him

435
00:48:00,049 --> 00:48:02,677
Hon. Tsugumo...

436
00:48:02,752 --> 00:48:04,982
you have heard his report

437
00:48:05,054 --> 00:48:09,582
I must ask you to name another as
your second

438
00:48:09,959 --> 00:48:17,832
Ah... most unfortunate! He seems too
indisposed to attend

439
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:26,608
Then I beg the services of Hayato Yazaki

440
00:48:27,977 --> 00:48:29,569
Hayato? You wish Hayato?

441
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:37,583
Inaba... has not Yazaki been absent also?

442
00:48:37,653 --> 00:48:44,058
Yes, sire... he applied for leave to
overcome his fatigue

443
00:48:44,827 --> 00:48:48,957
Hon. Tsugumo... I regret to say that

444
00:48:49,031 --> 00:48:52,330
Yazaki is also unavailable

445
00:48:52,401 --> 00:48:57,771
Oh? Hon. Yazaki is also indisposed?

446
00:48:57,840 --> 00:49:00,638
That is most unfortunate!

447
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:07,340
Then... as I have no choice...

448
00:49:07,416 --> 00:49:11,910
I would request Umenosuke Kawabe

449
00:49:16,025 --> 00:49:22,760
Hon. Elder... could hon. Kawabe also be ailing?

450
00:49:22,832 --> 00:49:25,528
Could such a thing be possible?

451
00:49:39,582 --> 00:49:46,044
Well, well! It seems that he also is indisposed

452
00:49:46,622 --> 00:49:53,687
That all three of them should find
this day unfeasible...

453
00:49:53,896 --> 00:49:57,457
A strange coincidence

454
00:49:59,368 --> 00:50:01,268
How odd indeed!

455
00:50:09,512 --> 00:50:12,413
All is not well...

456
00:50:13,015 --> 00:50:16,007
Hikokuro was most insistent

457
00:50:16,085 --> 00:50:20,852
and forced Motome Chijiiwa to commit Suicide

458
00:50:21,423 --> 00:50:28,556
It was Hayato Yazaki who discovered that
the blade was of bamboo...

459
00:50:28,631 --> 00:50:31,031
No... that was Umenosuke

460
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:34,263
After all... I warned them against it

461
00:50:34,336 --> 00:50:36,236
It's no use now

462
00:50:36,305 --> 00:50:38,273
Very true!

463
00:50:40,409 --> 00:50:43,071
But how will you cope with him?

464
00:50:43,145 --> 00:50:46,512
He is not one to die meekly

465
00:50:46,582 --> 00:50:51,576
He must be plotting something

466
00:50:52,321 --> 00:50:57,657
Whatever his intentions

467
00:50:59,061 --> 00:51:02,929
I will force his hand and make him
perform hara-kiri

468
00:51:03,866 --> 00:51:06,699
If he refuses,

469
00:51:07,002 --> 00:51:10,836
I will have my men cut him down
without mercy

470
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:20,443
What happens within these walls

471
00:51:20,783 --> 00:51:24,913
remains an unknown secret herein

472
00:51:28,257 --> 00:51:33,194
The men will attack at my signal

473
00:51:34,697 --> 00:51:39,498
But Hikokuro and the others bother me

474
00:51:40,970 --> 00:51:46,340
I should send someone but under
the circumstances,

475
00:51:46,408 --> 00:51:49,935
I wish you'd go personally

476
00:52:03,425 --> 00:52:07,054
Hon. Tsugumo

477
00:52:09,298 --> 00:52:16,067
Though summer days be long, time is fleeting

478
00:52:18,307 --> 00:52:22,471
I bid you resign yourself

479
00:52:23,345 --> 00:52:26,280
But hon. Elder! There can be no ritual
without a second

480
00:52:26,348 --> 00:52:32,048
Yes... I have just discussed the matter
with my major-dojo

481
00:52:32,121 --> 00:52:36,785
The men you request are not available

482
00:52:36,859 --> 00:52:40,420
So I will pick one for you

483
00:52:40,663 --> 00:52:43,029
Ichiro Shinmen!

484
00:52:43,465 --> 00:52:48,164
You will act as second for the
Geishu ex-warrior, Tsugumo

485
00:52:48,237 --> 00:52:50,705
Fulfill your duty with care

486
00:52:55,344 --> 00:52:58,074
With your permission,

487
00:52:58,147 --> 00:53:01,810
I named three men to serve as my second

488
00:53:01,884 --> 00:53:06,218
I would still insist on one of them

489
00:53:07,222 --> 00:53:09,986
Have you no ears?

490
00:53:13,562 --> 00:53:18,158
All three are indisposed today!

491
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:23,666
Is that not clear enough... or can't you hear?

492
00:53:24,473 --> 00:53:27,670
Oh? If such be the case,

493
00:53:27,743 --> 00:53:30,769
there is nothing I can do

494
00:53:30,846 --> 00:53:34,612
I fear this ritual must be postponed

495
00:53:35,150 --> 00:53:37,050
Hold your tongue!

496
00:53:38,654 --> 00:53:42,488
Your knavery goes too far!

497
00:53:42,758 --> 00:53:47,695
First you beg a site to perform hara-kiri

498
00:53:47,763 --> 00:53:51,096
Now you quibble over a second

499
00:53:51,367 --> 00:53:54,530
You never intended to die!

500
00:53:54,603 --> 00:53:56,571
Money was your motive!

501
00:53:56,638 --> 00:54:01,769
If I were a common extortioner,

502
00:54:01,844 --> 00:54:06,338
would I be placidly sitting here?

503
00:54:06,415 --> 00:54:09,748
I came prepared to die

504
00:54:09,985 --> 00:54:12,749
But hara-kiri alone

505
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:16,018
cannot ensure an easy trip to Hades

506
00:54:16,091 --> 00:54:19,857
A second is needed to lop this off

507
00:54:19,928 --> 00:54:23,921
A skilled master swordsman

508
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:28,260
What is more, I do not die a criminal

509
00:54:28,337 --> 00:54:31,795
I am free to choose a second

510
00:54:55,464 --> 00:55:03,098
You're a disgrace! A fraud!

511
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:26,625
Hara-kiri was not your motive...

512
00:55:26,695 --> 00:55:29,323
Insolent dog!

513
00:56:06,068 --> 00:56:07,535
Wait!

514
00:56:08,303 --> 00:56:10,271
Restrain yourselves!

515
00:56:38,700 --> 00:56:42,568
I beg a word with all present...

516
00:56:42,638 --> 00:56:44,037
Pray restrain yourselves!

517
00:56:44,740 --> 00:56:50,804
What now? It is too late for words

518
00:56:50,879 --> 00:56:52,870
No... not yet!

519
00:56:52,948 --> 00:56:55,542
I am not yet finished...

520
00:56:55,617 --> 00:56:58,450
With my life story

521
00:56:59,254 --> 00:57:03,884
For any more such lengthy tales, I have no ears!

522
00:57:03,959 --> 00:57:05,756
Hon. Elder

523
00:57:07,729 --> 00:57:10,459
Should you force my hand,

524
00:57:10,532 --> 00:57:14,434
I will do battle like one possessed

525
00:57:16,138 --> 00:57:21,235
Many of your innocent men will sustain injuries

526
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:24,502
Some may even die!

527
00:57:25,948 --> 00:57:29,577
Would it not be wiser

528
00:57:29,651 --> 00:57:32,119
for all to hear out my tale?

529
00:57:34,222 --> 00:57:38,750
Then I will disembowel myself in good grace

530
00:57:39,094 --> 00:57:41,858
Should hara-kiri be too good for me,

531
00:57:41,930 --> 00:57:45,559
you may turn your men on me

532
00:57:47,402 --> 00:57:54,535
But for now... I entreat you to hear me
out to the end

533
00:58:02,651 --> 00:58:07,679
You will remain true to your word?

534
00:58:08,056 --> 00:58:10,490
I swear it!

535
00:58:11,627 --> 00:58:14,425
On your samurai honor?

536
00:58:29,845 --> 00:58:33,941
Good! But make it short

537
00:58:34,016 --> 00:58:38,976
I have no ears for long, absurd tales

538
00:58:40,288 --> 00:58:42,654
Stand back, men!

539
00:58:58,740 --> 00:59:01,334
Now... where was I?

540
00:59:05,681 --> 00:59:11,278
Oh, yes... my master's house abolished;

541
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:15,084
the death of Jinnai Chijiiwa

542
00:59:15,157 --> 00:59:22,359
and I had just reached the point
where he entrust me with his son

543
00:59:26,568 --> 00:59:30,800
Following my master's downfall,

544
00:59:30,872 --> 00:59:35,741
I left the land and came to Edo

545
00:59:35,977 --> 00:59:42,405
The end of civil war created hordes of
ex-warriors

546
00:59:42,484 --> 00:59:47,251
In better times, a clan would gladly
have employed

547
00:59:47,322 --> 00:59:50,917
a distinguished ex-warrior

548
00:59:50,992 --> 00:59:58,330
But in times of peace, the honored warrior
is no longer in demand

549
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:02,666
He eats or fasts as Fate dictates

550
01:00:02,738 --> 01:00:07,505
Yes... it shames me to recall our life

551
01:00:07,576 --> 01:00:10,841
during the past 8-9 years

552
01:00:13,949 --> 01:00:18,977
However... even amidst such misery,

553
01:00:19,054 --> 01:00:23,423
My daughter, Miho, continued to grow

554
01:00:23,492 --> 01:00:26,950
and soon it was her 18th spring...

555
01:00:54,723 --> 01:00:56,520
Hon. Sire...

556
01:00:57,192 --> 01:00:59,683
Should I not return by midday,

557
01:00:59,761 --> 01:01:02,525
your meal is prepared

558
01:01:02,597 --> 01:01:08,194
The finest delicacy loses taste
when one dines alone

559
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,397
I will wait

560
01:01:11,139 --> 01:01:16,099
Then after I receive payment,
I will purchase some dried fish

561
01:01:17,846 --> 01:01:19,711
Your pardon!

562
01:01:21,116 --> 01:01:23,949
Busy? You're going out?

563
01:01:24,019 --> 01:01:26,544
Yes... to see the whole saler

564
01:01:26,621 --> 01:01:28,350
The Hon. Mikawaya?

565
01:01:28,423 --> 01:01:29,890
Good luck!

566
01:01:37,999 --> 01:01:43,403
Experience surpasses training! You're quite
an expert now

567
01:01:43,572 --> 01:01:45,699
Forgive me

568
01:01:45,774 --> 01:01:48,106
For constantly requesting advances

569
01:01:48,176 --> 01:01:52,203
My earrings are so meager

570
01:01:52,280 --> 01:01:56,910
Your frank innocence disarms me

571
01:01:56,985 --> 01:02:00,785
I had intended a few harsh words

572
01:02:00,856 --> 01:02:05,623
By taking the initiative, you tie my hands

573
01:02:05,694 --> 01:02:08,390
I bow to you

574
01:02:08,864 --> 01:02:14,825
By the way... that proposition I put to
you the other day...

575
01:02:18,707 --> 01:02:22,666
Have you given it serious thought?

576
01:02:25,347 --> 01:02:27,247
Yes... my mind is made up

577
01:02:27,315 --> 01:02:30,148
Oh? That's gratifying!

578
01:02:30,218 --> 01:02:34,177
Yes, it takes a great burden off my mind

579
01:02:35,256 --> 01:02:40,718
No... your proposal regarding Miho...

580
01:02:41,229 --> 01:02:44,357
I have definitely decided against it

581
01:02:50,505 --> 01:02:57,911
In short, the adoption of Miho would
merely be a pretext

582
01:02:57,979 --> 01:03:03,440
The Sakakibara family would then make a
concubine of her

583
01:03:05,587 --> 01:03:10,456
Hon. Tsugumo... it's a powerful clan

584
01:03:10,525 --> 01:03:13,551
To be related to them

585
01:03:13,628 --> 01:03:16,859
would assure you a rewarding future

586
01:03:16,932 --> 01:03:19,628
Yes... I am aware of that

587
01:03:19,868 --> 01:03:24,771
However, hon. Seibei never will I sacrifice
my daughter

588
01:03:24,839 --> 01:03:28,104
to further my fortunes

589
01:03:28,176 --> 01:03:32,670
Pride is all right

590
01:03:32,747 --> 01:03:36,774
but should not a parent consider her plight?

591
01:03:37,052 --> 01:03:40,647
A young... and beautiful... girl

592
01:03:40,722 --> 01:03:43,657
without even a festival kimono

593
01:03:43,725 --> 01:03:47,058
Day in and day out...

594
01:03:47,128 --> 01:03:49,961
slaving at her father's side!

595
01:03:50,031 --> 01:03:54,832
Hon. Tsugumo... do not be led a stray by
these times

596
01:03:54,903 --> 01:03:58,566
It's futile to fight the tide

597
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,835
For Miho's sake and your own...

598
01:04:00,909 --> 01:04:04,572
it's all too obvious...

599
01:04:04,646 --> 01:04:07,012
For Miho's sake and your own...

600
01:04:07,082 --> 01:04:11,246
only because she is blessed with

601
01:04:11,319 --> 01:04:14,584
such beauty is such opportunity made possible

602
01:04:17,325 --> 01:04:19,088
Confucius says

603
01:04:19,327 --> 01:04:21,158
Confucius says

604
01:04:21,896 --> 01:04:26,390
Ignorance of one's mission
makes not a Superior Person

605
01:04:26,968 --> 01:04:32,372
Ignorance of one's mission
makes not a Superior Person

606
01:04:32,974 --> 01:04:36,910
Ignorance of etiquette means failure

607
01:04:37,278 --> 01:04:41,715
Ignorance of words means ignorance of men

608
01:04:54,029 --> 01:04:58,326
Class dismissed!
- Thank you, master

609
01:05:16,775 --> 01:05:18,143
Hon.Sire...

610
01:05:27,818 --> 01:05:29,547
Welcome, Sire...

611
01:05:38,025 --> 01:05:40,555
Have some

612
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:48,595
I took the liberty of preparing us some tea

613
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:59,316
However, Motome... I have come for
some serious words with you

614
01:05:59,652 --> 01:06:04,091
Honored one... why such formality?

615
01:06:06,463 --> 01:06:10,195
Indeed... the days and months flow past
so swiftly!

616
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:13,499
Miho is already eighteen

617
01:06:15,174 --> 01:06:18,508
And looking more and more like her mother

618
01:06:18,579 --> 01:06:21,778
It seems unbelievable that she could
be my child

619
01:06:21,851 --> 01:06:24,946
No... if she had taken after me,

620
01:06:25,021 --> 01:06:29,653
such beauty would be impossible

621
01:06:29,728 --> 01:06:34,064
Honored One... why are you talking this way?

622
01:06:34,902 --> 01:06:39,603
You see... Motome...

623
01:06:42,112 --> 01:06:48,019
I want you to take Miho as your wife

624
01:06:54,496 --> 01:06:58,229
I realize that this is all very sudden

625
01:06:58,302 --> 01:07:02,433
But... how about it, Motome?

626
01:07:03,176 --> 01:07:09,414
Surely you are aware of the poverty in
which I live

627
01:07:09,485 --> 01:07:14,015
As tutor for my neighbors children,

628
01:07:14,091 --> 01:07:18,188
I sustain my miserable existence

629
01:07:20,033 --> 01:07:23,562
How could I possibly take a wife?

630
01:07:23,638 --> 01:07:27,336
You dislike Miho?

631
01:07:29,246 --> 01:07:33,411
Do you like her... or don't you?

632
01:07:39,293 --> 01:07:42,821
I do not ask you to marry Miho

633
01:07:42,898 --> 01:07:46,961
merely because it was your sire's wish

634
01:07:49,006 --> 01:07:51,841
No... boorish warrior that I am,
I can feel for you and Miho

635
01:07:51,911 --> 01:07:56,680
Convincing Motome was no simple matter

636
01:07:57,485 --> 01:08:02,858
The lad had a stubborn streak

637
01:08:04,463 --> 01:08:10,700
which I had failed to realize

638
01:08:11,872 --> 01:08:15,310
However... he did love Miho

639
01:08:15,378 --> 01:08:20,214
and Miho certainly had no objections

640
01:08:21,052 --> 01:08:27,118
The crane which lives 1,000 years

641
01:08:27,562 --> 01:08:34,299
Symbolizes the countless happy joys;

642
01:08:34,604 --> 01:08:41,741
The tortoise prevails 10,000 years

643
01:08:42,148 --> 01:08:49,524
Bearing, the crowning triple pleasures

644
01:08:50,427 --> 01:08:55,492
Hay the glistening sands long reflect

645
01:08:55,735 --> 01:09:05,375
The sun of numerous morning to come

646
01:09:06,516 --> 01:09:12,650
Two years passed, brought them their first son

647
01:09:13,093 --> 01:09:16,585
A son who was named Kingo

648
01:09:18,132 --> 01:09:23,732
It was I, of course, who served as the
infant's godfather

649
01:09:38,962 --> 01:09:40,361
Welcome, sire

650
01:09:46,673 --> 01:09:49,541
No... not asleep

651
01:10:00,793 --> 01:10:04,788
Hon. Sire... you are too generous

652
01:10:05,266 --> 01:10:10,103
Nonsense! Amidst your own chores,
you care for me

653
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:13,632
What is here... now that I am alone,

654
01:10:13,712 --> 01:10:16,648
my wealth becomes a burden

655
01:10:16,716 --> 01:10:20,778
Can't take it with me

656
01:10:22,957 --> 01:10:28,659
Oh, no... it seems I have awakened him!

657
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:32,227
Yes, my fine rascal dimples

658
01:10:32,304 --> 01:10:36,834
are not for a warrior's son

659
01:10:36,910 --> 01:10:38,207
You little rogue!

660
01:10:46,824 --> 01:10:50,489
Oh? The Matsudaira Clan abolished?

661
01:10:50,562 --> 01:10:55,002
Yes. As with many another provincial warlord

662
01:10:55,070 --> 01:11:00,408
However... this Clan was a link in
Tokugawa power

663
01:11:00,477 --> 01:11:03,413
One outcome is sure... more ex-warriors!

664
01:11:03,481 --> 01:11:05,950
Listen?

665
01:11:06,552 --> 01:11:11,457
You heard how one threatened hara-kiri
at the Sengoku mansion

666
01:11:16,667 --> 01:11:27,275
An ex-warrior from a provincial clan,
one Shume Chi...

667
01:11:27,749 --> 01:11:33,053
Will this wake up the Sengoku?

668
01:11:33,123 --> 01:11:36,389
It doesn't matter

669
01:11:36,461 --> 01:11:44,769
Many ex-warriors force themselves
into various mansions

670
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,972
threatening hara-kiri

671
01:11:49,046 --> 01:11:52,643
To stop these disturbances,

672
01:11:52,718 --> 01:11:56,678
these households reluctantly offer them coins

673
01:11:56,756 --> 01:11:59,954
A most shameful turn of events

674
01:12:02,165 --> 01:12:05,567
Yes... a disgrace!

675
01:12:05,636 --> 01:12:08,606
These happened

676
01:12:08,673 --> 01:12:15,376
No officials' assistance,

677
01:12:15,650 --> 01:12:22,058
things will continues

678
01:12:23,661 --> 01:12:27,190
As you have said,

679
01:12:27,267 --> 01:12:33,641
no report of officials' efforts for
the help of times like these

680
01:12:33,709 --> 01:12:38,113
Live under the poverty... how can one
become so base?

681
01:12:40,652 --> 01:12:43,020
Yes... what is it?

682
01:12:43,089 --> 01:12:45,523
It is time now

683
01:12:45,592 --> 01:12:46,650
It's the time, he wants his milk

684
01:12:46,726 --> 01:12:49,697
Whenever he cries out, you feed him

685
01:12:49,765 --> 01:12:51,631
An evil habit to form

686
01:12:51,701 --> 01:12:52,998
Look... Kingo!

687
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:54,037
How, look...?

688
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:58,041
Kingo, like it?

689
01:13:29,822 --> 01:13:34,659
With Kingo, we fear nothing

690
01:13:34,729 --> 01:13:36,391
Life was full of laughter

691
01:13:36,464 --> 01:13:41,460
However... such happy days were not
destined continue forever

692
01:13:43,607 --> 01:13:46,236
The snowing winter,

693
01:13:46,311 --> 01:13:50,249
snow was as thick as the mountain

694
01:13:56,426 --> 01:14:03,334
One day... Miho vomited blood

695
01:14:32,176 --> 01:14:37,412
One had always been a delicate child
and drudgery was too much

696
01:14:37,484 --> 01:14:45,416
Her frail body had been over-worked too often

697
01:14:45,695 --> 01:14:50,566
I can help nothing...

698
01:15:24,650 --> 01:15:29,281
Motme tried hard

699
01:15:30,758 --> 01:15:32,920
The poor boy!

700
01:15:33,496 --> 01:15:35,657
Town Labor Poo

701
01:15:35,732 --> 01:15:40,330
Fifty men, forty yens

702
01:15:40,940 --> 01:15:44,605
Fifty men, forty yens

703
01:15:46,781 --> 01:15:49,683
Look, samurai!

704
01:15:49,752 --> 01:15:55,920
Stay out! The townsmen need work

705
01:15:55,994 --> 01:15:59,396
A sword-bearing laborer can only
bring me trouble

706
01:16:00,234 --> 01:16:06,971
Twenty men, forty-five yens

707
01:16:24,234 --> 01:16:31,837
Motome's plight was pitiful!

708
01:16:31,911 --> 01:16:35,747
His every effort ended in vain

709
01:16:35,817 --> 01:16:40,381
Miho went from bad to worse

710
01:16:40,457 --> 01:16:46,056
Strange how evil hounds misfortune!

711
01:16:46,131 --> 01:16:48,897
I still recall how we barely survived that year

712
01:16:48,969 --> 01:16:53,271
Then as the spring of this year brought
forth plum blossoms...

713
01:17:14,371 --> 01:17:16,864
What is it?

714
01:17:19,245 --> 01:17:21,077
Motome!

715
01:17:28,491 --> 01:17:31,393
Is it Miho?

716
01:17:33,532 --> 01:17:35,023
It is Miho?

717
01:17:36,703 --> 01:17:38,764
It's... Kingo...

718
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:41,308
What? Kingo?

719
01:17:44,347 --> 01:17:49,287
He's feverish! He burns with fever

720
01:17:54,328 --> 01:17:56,991
Miho... were you standing idly by

721
01:17:57,065 --> 01:18:01,230
while this child was stricken?

722
01:18:01,304 --> 01:18:06,005
It seemed a fever brought by a cold

723
01:18:06,077 --> 01:18:08,604
But... what did the physician say?

724
01:18:11,119 --> 01:18:13,054
He came... did he not?

725
01:18:25,839 --> 01:18:29,708
You have not called in the physician?

726
01:18:31,147 --> 01:18:35,347
But... why didn't you?

727
01:18:47,303 --> 01:18:55,873
Kingo! Don't give up

728
01:18:59,486 --> 01:19:04,552
This Old One and your parents

729
01:19:04,661 --> 01:19:08,292
have long since sold our valuables

730
01:19:08,365 --> 01:19:13,270
There is nothing... nothing we can
do to save you!

731
01:19:18,413 --> 01:19:24,446
Though we be so helpless

732
01:19:26,358 --> 01:19:28,849
Kingo a good samurai

733
01:19:28,927 --> 01:19:31,193
must not give up the fight!

734
01:19:35,671 --> 01:19:39,199
Kingo, you mustn't lose!

735
01:19:39,276 --> 01:19:40,676
You mustn't!

736
01:20:02,776 --> 01:20:07,340
You mustn't lose... you mustn't!

737
01:20:12,456 --> 01:20:15,153
There is still one final chance

738
01:20:20,134 --> 01:20:30,309
In my absence... look after Kingo

739
01:20:32,284 --> 01:20:38,020
Motome... what is this new idea?

740
01:20:39,761 --> 01:20:43,494
I know a former retainer

741
01:20:43,567 --> 01:20:46,162
who is now a money-lender

742
01:20:46,237 --> 01:20:50,299
But his rates were so high!

743
01:20:50,376 --> 01:20:53,745
And this is no time to be concerned
about details

744
01:20:53,815 --> 01:20:55,282
You are right!

745
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:58,844
If you know such a person... hurry!

746
01:20:58,922 --> 01:21:00,686
Yes, I go now

747
01:21:00,758 --> 01:21:04,752
I will return by evening at the latest

748
01:21:06,666 --> 01:21:09,761
As Miho is also bed-ridden,

749
01:21:10,005 --> 01:21:12,873
I beg you to look after Kingo

750
01:21:12,942 --> 01:21:16,276
Do not worry, I'll be here

751
01:21:16,346 --> 01:21:21,081
But, Motome, he is seriously ill

752
01:21:21,153 --> 01:21:22,382
The greatest haste is required

753
01:21:22,455 --> 01:21:25,949
Make arrangements and hurry back

754
01:21:26,995 --> 01:21:31,057
Yes... I will return by evening

755
01:21:31,467 --> 01:21:33,163
I go now

756
01:21:39,045 --> 01:21:42,608
We depend on you, Motome

757
01:22:19,769 --> 01:22:22,137
No, let me do it

758
01:22:37,695 --> 01:22:41,723
Kingo... just a while longer...

759
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:17,041
What delays him?

760
01:23:52,934 --> 01:23:54,664
This will not do!

761
01:23:55,638 --> 01:23:57,266
What is keeping Motome?

762
01:23:57,741 --> 01:24:00,540
What takes him so long?

763
01:24:30,421 --> 01:24:35,052
Getting up now will do no good for
Kingo's fever!

764
01:24:50,516 --> 01:24:55,113
Where can Motome be?

765
01:24:55,189 --> 01:24:57,623
He should have returned by evening

766
01:24:57,692 --> 01:24:59,388
He promised!

767
01:24:59,461 --> 01:25:04,663
What keeps him? Where can he be?

768
01:25:06,004 --> 01:25:09,703
I continued to wait

769
01:25:10,042 --> 01:25:15,004
Each hour seemed as long as autumn day

770
01:25:15,484 --> 01:25:17,749
But we waited in vain

771
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:21,816
Motome never did return to us

772
01:25:23,428 --> 01:25:26,489
I will return by evening

773
01:25:26,567 --> 01:25:28,468
Look after Kingo...

774
01:25:29,671 --> 01:25:33,540
Those were his words on departing

775
01:25:33,609 --> 01:25:38,049
Such was my final parting with
Motome Chijiiwa

776
01:25:47,896 --> 01:25:53,337
However... later that night at the Hour
of the Dog

777
01:25:53,405 --> 01:25:57,206
Motome did come home

778
01:25:57,276 --> 01:26:01,237
But only by himself

779
01:26:01,315 --> 01:26:06,550
He was accompanied by a gallant escort
of retainers

780
01:26:06,623 --> 01:26:09,286
and underlings of the Iyi Clan

781
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:16,662
Such was the hon. Chijiiwa's touching request

782
01:26:16,737 --> 01:26:21,039
However, our gateway was unsuitable,

783
01:26:21,110 --> 01:26:25,572
and we cordially accommodated him in
our garden,

784
01:26:25,650 --> 01:26:29,315
where he was able to fulfill his wish

785
01:26:31,358 --> 01:26:38,232
Of late, one hears of mansion frequently
visited by ex-warriors

786
01:26:38,301 --> 01:26:39,997
who extort a pittance

787
01:26:40,070 --> 01:26:43,872
by threatening disembowelment

788
01:26:43,942 --> 01:26:50,009
We understand that the households are
greatly embarrassed thereby

789
01:26:50,084 --> 01:26:53,680
However... advent of

790
01:26:53,755 --> 01:26:56,089
this honorable samurai, Chijiiwa,

791
01:26:56,160 --> 01:26:58,789
who did die by hara-kiri:

792
01:26:58,864 --> 01:27:03,165
And the honored House of Iyi

793
01:27:03,236 --> 01:27:06,901
which did not fail to adopt appropriate
measures;

794
01:27:07,208 --> 01:27:11,476
these two serve as examples to ex-warriors

795
01:27:11,548 --> 01:27:15,849
and to weak-kneed members of
other households

796
01:27:15,921 --> 01:27:19,653
A refreshing breeze

797
01:27:19,727 --> 01:27:24,097
and eye-opener for such disgraceful elements!

798
01:27:24,166 --> 01:27:28,103
Surely a matter for mutual congratulations

799
01:27:29,307 --> 01:27:31,741
Show the blades

800
01:27:32,044 --> 01:27:33,511
A moot point

801
01:27:34,881 --> 01:27:41,482
Will you examine the two swords of
the deceased?

802
01:27:46,063 --> 01:27:49,830
Please note... they are of bamboo

803
01:27:50,770 --> 01:27:52,432
Of bamboo?

804
01:27:53,840 --> 01:27:56,002
Miho!

805
01:28:09,763 --> 01:28:12,631
Note that both blades are of bamboo

806
01:28:12,701 --> 01:28:17,868
We want no claims regarding loss of the blades

807
01:28:17,941 --> 01:28:20,410
Is that quite clear?

808
01:28:24,351 --> 01:28:26,843
You understand?

809
01:28:31,227 --> 01:28:36,462
The... Motome begged the loan of a blade

810
01:28:36,534 --> 01:28:39,163
from one of you?

811
01:28:39,238 --> 01:28:42,140
Such was not the case

812
01:28:42,209 --> 01:28:47,149
He died magnificently... using that blades!

813
01:28:49,486 --> 01:28:55,428
Motome... died by the bamboo blade?

814
01:28:56,162 --> 01:28:57,960
Correct!

815
01:28:58,966 --> 01:29:02,699
We witnessed in detail the ritual performed
with bamboo blade

816
01:29:02,772 --> 01:29:05,503
An unsightly affair!

817
01:29:05,742 --> 01:29:10,738
A samurai needs to die by a true blade

818
01:29:10,816 --> 01:29:15,448
which is a warrior's soul

819
01:29:17,192 --> 01:29:20,924
Now... we take leave

820
01:31:10,018 --> 01:31:12,452
Miho wept...

821
01:31:14,891 --> 01:31:18,920
and wept...

822
01:31:19,598 --> 01:31:21,760
and wept...

823
01:32:56,568 --> 01:33:02,066
Forgive me!

824
01:33:06,615 --> 01:33:11,281
It was I... who was so thoughtless!

825
01:33:20,502 --> 01:33:24,099
You sold those blades...

826
01:33:24,441 --> 01:33:30,973
You sold them for Miho's sake...

827
01:33:47,273 --> 01:33:49,902
And still... I never realized...

828
01:33:49,976 --> 01:33:53,345
Yet... I never parted with mine

829
01:33:53,415 --> 01:33:57,113
I would never have dared

830
01:33:57,188 --> 01:34:00,590
In my ignorance,

831
01:34:00,825 --> 01:34:07,792
I clung... to these worthless symbols

832
01:34:26,896 --> 01:34:29,057
Useless tokens...

833
01:34:29,132 --> 01:34:32,865
Ravaged by raging fever and in a coma,

834
01:34:32,937 --> 01:34:36,534
Kingo died some two days later

835
01:34:38,146 --> 01:34:40,205
And three days later...

836
01:34:41,316 --> 01:34:43,785
Miho also passed on...

837
01:34:44,454 --> 01:34:48,016
following her child to the next world

838
01:34:50,996 --> 01:34:57,302
Thus was Hanshiro Tsugumo left alone
in this world

839
01:34:57,372 --> 01:35:00,672
Alone and solitary figure...

840
01:35:02,412 --> 01:35:04,746
Hon. Tsugumo...

841
01:35:06,952 --> 01:35:10,481
Does that conclude your tale?

842
01:35:11,759 --> 01:35:13,455
Yes... in a way

843
01:35:19,803 --> 01:35:22,797
No! I wish one final word

844
01:35:26,246 --> 01:35:30,685
I beg all in attendance to listen well

845
01:35:32,755 --> 01:35:37,057
No matter how dire his circumstances,

846
01:35:37,128 --> 01:35:40,896
for a member of the samurai class

847
01:35:40,967 --> 01:35:47,272
to extort aid by threatening hara-kiri

848
01:35:47,342 --> 01:35:50,871
is an abominable act and cannot be forgiven!

849
01:35:51,882 --> 01:35:54,375
On the other hand,

850
01:35:56,222 --> 01:36:03,096
This household's method of coping with Chijiiwa

851
01:36:03,331 --> 01:36:08,032
can justly be said to leave much to be desired

852
01:36:10,342 --> 01:36:13,574
A samurai shaming himself

853
01:36:13,780 --> 01:36:19,015
By begging a few days of grace must
certainly have a reason

854
01:36:22,058 --> 01:36:25,426
Certainly it was not out of place for you to
ask his reason!

855
01:36:25,830 --> 01:36:29,324
Is this asking too much?

856
01:36:29,403 --> 01:36:32,237
Did not one of you now present feel need

857
01:36:33,207 --> 01:36:36,644
for such consideration?

858
01:36:40,284 --> 01:36:43,118
With a wife fatally stricken

859
01:36:43,789 --> 01:36:48,387
and an innocent, ailing child demanding
immediate attention...

860
01:36:49,531 --> 01:36:51,556
He begged this chance to inform me

861
01:36:51,633 --> 01:36:56,231
and to make one final effort

862
01:36:56,473 --> 01:37:01,641
before leaving matters in my hands and
returning to this mansion

863
01:37:01,715 --> 01:37:04,183
Hanshiro Tsuguma!

864
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:07,250
Enough of your excuses!

865
01:37:11,228 --> 01:37:14,255
Chijiiwa may have been victim of

866
01:37:14,833 --> 01:37:17,895
various circumstances

867
01:37:19,538 --> 01:37:22,703
But he himself want to die!

868
01:37:23,912 --> 01:37:28,317
Though matters did not go as planned,

869
01:37:28,386 --> 01:37:30,854
he sowed his own seeds

870
01:37:31,823 --> 01:37:36,489
It was not for him to resent,
blame or accuse others!

871
01:37:37,866 --> 01:37:43,898
It was for him to forget all else and
die a magnificent death

872
01:37:44,841 --> 01:37:50,076
To go unwavering to one's death is
the way of the true samurai!

873
01:37:50,916 --> 01:37:53,352
But to plead for days of grace!

874
01:37:53,421 --> 01:37:57,052
Signs of a true coward!

875
01:37:57,492 --> 01:38:01,021
No wonder one thought him mad!

876
01:38:01,098 --> 01:38:03,567
Yes, you are right!

877
01:38:03,902 --> 01:38:07,601
Truly, Motome was not in his right mind

878
01:38:07,674 --> 01:38:10,235
But for such state of mind,

879
01:38:10,311 --> 01:38:12,405
I have only praise

880
01:38:14,117 --> 01:38:18,612
Even the famous samurai is a mere
human being

881
01:38:18,690 --> 01:38:21,819
He cannot live on air alone

882
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:26,097
In a crisis,

883
01:38:26,166 --> 01:38:30,161
even men like Motome will stand by
their family

884
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:32,367
Yes, and I'm glad!

885
01:38:33,243 --> 01:38:37,875
The bamboo ex-warrior

886
01:38:37,950 --> 01:38:42,389
Not only samurai...

887
01:38:42,756 --> 01:38:48,595
even the townsmen sneer at
Motome's memory

888
01:38:48,665 --> 01:38:50,964
Yes. Let them who would... laugh!

889
01:38:52,704 --> 01:38:58,737
It is impossible to fathom the hearts of all men

890
01:38:58,813 --> 01:39:03,080
The ruthless Shogunate policy of wiping
out the provincial lords,

891
01:39:03,152 --> 01:39:07,489
brings ruin to innocent thousands!

892
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:12,862
The well fed may never realize this

893
01:39:12,933 --> 01:39:15,767
Some among you

894
01:39:15,837 --> 01:39:18,830
may loathe Motome for his pleas

895
01:39:21,778 --> 01:39:26,275
Put yourself in his position,

896
01:39:26,552 --> 01:39:29,387
what would you have done?

897
01:39:29,689 --> 01:39:31,989
After all... our samurai honor...

898
01:39:32,060 --> 01:39:32,458
merely glosses the surface

899
01:39:32,527 --> 01:39:33,653
Enough nonsense!

900
01:39:33,829 --> 01:39:39,359
You dare suggest that our honor is
merely superficial?

901
01:39:40,438 --> 01:39:42,099
That's right!

902
01:39:45,111 --> 01:39:47,945
Some threaten hara-kiri

903
01:39:48,250 --> 01:39:50,775
and try to evade the consequences

904
01:39:50,852 --> 01:39:53,880
Such wishful thinking can be perilous

905
01:39:55,192 --> 01:40:01,099
Any who ask are allowed to die

906
01:40:01,835 --> 01:40:04,771
In fact... we see to it that they do!

907
01:40:04,839 --> 01:40:06,102
It is the way of our Clan

908
01:40:06,175 --> 01:40:08,371
No half measures for us!

909
01:40:26,203 --> 01:40:29,605
In other words,

910
01:40:29,674 --> 01:40:34,045
you believe that I have no intentions of dying?

911
01:40:34,114 --> 01:40:37,916
That I come, enraged at the way

912
01:40:37,986 --> 01:40:42,448
you dealt with my son-in-law,

913
01:40:42,526 --> 01:40:46,486
merely to give voice to my numerous grudges?

914
01:40:46,564 --> 01:40:48,966
Is that what you believe?

915
01:40:49,269 --> 01:40:51,430
Need you ask me?

916
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:55,303
You need only ask yourself

917
01:40:56,045 --> 01:41:01,384
Either way... you have no intention of
letting me get away?

918
01:41:01,687 --> 01:41:03,746
That is my choice

919
01:41:04,791 --> 01:41:07,956
I see no reason to ask you to leave

920
01:41:08,629 --> 01:41:15,299
Hon. Elder... suspicious eyes welcome the devil

921
01:41:15,372 --> 01:41:17,637
You recognize the proverb?

922
01:41:19,445 --> 01:41:24,350
My promise to perform hara-kiri is not a fraud

923
01:41:29,492 --> 01:41:33,658
Despite all my efforts... you still...

924
01:41:35,033 --> 01:41:39,233
First of all... even if I do live on,

925
01:41:39,307 --> 01:41:43,108
what is there to look forward to?

926
01:41:44,747 --> 01:41:46,944
Much rather would I hurry to join Motome...

927
01:41:47,017 --> 01:41:50,749
Miho... and Kingo

928
01:41:51,957 --> 01:41:57,261
In the Land beyond where they await
my coming

929
01:41:57,599 --> 01:42:04,473
However... I cannot go to them with
both these hands empty

930
01:42:05,643 --> 01:42:08,044
Is that not true?

931
01:42:13,020 --> 01:42:18,552
Explaining Motome's predicament enables

932
01:42:18,995 --> 01:42:23,331
your men to understand his position...

933
01:42:23,401 --> 01:42:27,305
To reflect on their own hot-blooded approach...

934
01:42:28,275 --> 01:42:32,737
Not all are convinced that they did right

935
01:42:32,981 --> 01:42:37,784
Was it possible that they might have
carried things too far?

936
01:42:39,089 --> 01:42:43,790
Perhaps more appropriate measures could
have been taken...

937
01:42:45,099 --> 01:42:49,366
A single word to this effect would being
satisfaction to Motome

938
01:42:49,438 --> 01:42:53,467
Would this not be most fitting gift I could
take to him?

939
01:42:55,112 --> 01:43:00,916
Such were my plans... but to my regret,
that was not to be

940
01:43:01,522 --> 01:43:06,325
Now we understand each other

941
01:43:07,630 --> 01:43:10,601
Your touching tale is of no use

942
01:43:10,668 --> 01:43:13,866
No... a samurai who claims that honor serves

943
01:43:16,176 --> 01:43:18,839
only to embellish the surface

944
01:43:18,913 --> 01:43:23,716
could never reach our hearts

945
01:43:24,054 --> 01:43:27,581
In short... they are the illogical

946
01:43:30,630 --> 01:43:36,435
grumbling of a senile ex-warrior?

947
01:43:38,741 --> 01:43:44,046
Well... it serves no purpose to lament that now

948
01:43:48,689 --> 01:43:53,754
Forgive my prolonged narrative

949
01:43:53,996 --> 01:43:58,094
Now I go through with the ritual...

950
01:44:00,973 --> 01:44:03,306
Oh... one moment!

951
01:44:05,245 --> 01:44:06,610
Before beginning,

952
01:44:07,783 --> 01:44:12,518
I must return some items entrusted to me

953
01:44:33,051 --> 01:44:38,286
Each bears the name of the original owner

954
01:44:38,359 --> 01:44:40,760
Please, study them

955
01:44:48,039 --> 01:44:53,946
Hon. Hayato Yazaki... hon.
Umenosuke Kawabe... both swordsmen

956
01:44:54,982 --> 01:44:59,478
held in high esteem by the Iyi Clan

957
01:44:59,555 --> 01:45:02,890
for their honored bravery

958
01:45:03,627 --> 01:45:05,859
But, hon. Elder...

959
01:45:06,498 --> 01:45:12,235
and others in attendance... be not concerned!

960
01:45:12,307 --> 01:45:15,175
I accepted only their top-knots

961
01:45:15,245 --> 01:45:18,113
and not their lives

962
01:45:24,390 --> 01:45:30,389
My encounter with hon. Yazaki took place
six days ago...

963
01:47:26,430 --> 01:47:28,159
One moment!

964
01:47:37,813 --> 01:47:41,146
Hon. Kawabe was disposed of five days ago...

965
01:47:41,216 --> 01:47:44,449
on May 8th

966
01:48:53,019 --> 01:48:59,324
But the master swordsmen of the
Shindo-Munen School,

967
01:48:59,861 --> 01:49:05,062
hon. Hikokuro Omodaka was not to be
made light of...

968
01:49:06,170 --> 01:49:10,939
Possibly aware of the fate of his
two companions,

969
01:49:11,011 --> 01:49:14,038
he was never off guard

970
01:49:14,115 --> 01:49:16,311
Yes... to be honest,

971
01:49:16,385 --> 01:49:22,793
I was at a loss as to how to deal with hon.
Omodaka

972
01:50:20,141 --> 01:50:23,874
As you reach out for your blade

973
01:50:24,514 --> 01:50:29,112
I draw... and fell you with one blow!

974
01:50:37,833 --> 01:50:44,707
However... I fear that my blade will be
blocked by this lintel

975
01:50:48,248 --> 01:50:54,052
A sideward blow at your waist is hampered
by this pillar

976
01:50:58,395 --> 01:50:59,693
Forgive my delay

977
01:50:59,764 --> 01:51:01,925
I couldn't find you

978
01:51:04,237 --> 01:51:05,932
Please, make ready

979
01:51:09,610 --> 01:51:12,546
As one cannot duel here,

980
01:51:12,614 --> 01:51:16,610
we will repair to the Plains of Gojin-In

981
01:51:19,759 --> 01:51:24,959
Hovel that it is,

982
01:51:28,337 --> 01:51:32,833
the owner may be annoyed if you fail to return

983
01:51:35,314 --> 01:51:38,547
And someone must come to dispose of
your corpse

984
01:51:43,992 --> 01:51:46,087
I suggest a short note stating that

985
01:51:46,163 --> 01:51:48,394
you proceed to the Plains of Gojin-In

986
01:51:48,465 --> 01:51:51,300
to duel with Hikokuro Omodaka

987
01:56:27,893 --> 01:56:31,057
He wisely took advantage of the winds

988
01:56:31,131 --> 01:56:35,001
But a blade not only cuts... it can stab or
be used to snap others

989
01:56:35,070 --> 01:56:37,733
Swordsmanship untested in battle

990
01:56:38,009 --> 01:56:40,603
is like swimming on land

991
01:56:40,678 --> 01:56:43,477
Be that as it may it was my first fight in
16 years

992
01:57:05,246 --> 01:57:10,312
Since the Summer Siege of Osaka

993
01:57:10,387 --> 01:57:15,019
Taking a man's head is not easy

994
01:57:15,961 --> 01:57:22,425
But to take only his top-knot was harder still!

995
01:57:27,978 --> 01:57:30,504
Irrespective of skill,

996
01:57:30,582 --> 01:57:36,318
to lose one's top-knot is equivalent to
losing one's head

997
01:57:37,025 --> 01:57:38,960
A laxity and dishonor

998
01:57:39,294 --> 01:57:41,992
which even death cannot wipe away!

999
01:57:43,468 --> 01:57:47,701
Yet, they claim illness and hide

1000
01:57:47,773 --> 01:57:52,474
until their top-knots grow back, hon. Elder!

1001
01:57:55,918 --> 01:58:00,219
You boast of traditions of bravery but

1002
01:58:00,290 --> 01:58:05,889
even the code of the House of Iyi seeks
only a false front!

1003
01:58:20,185 --> 01:58:24,055
A maniac! Fell the culprit!

1004
02:06:30,978 --> 02:06:34,279
Hanshiro Tsugumo has fallen, sire

1005
02:06:37,387 --> 02:06:40,118
And our casualties?

1006
02:06:40,558 --> 02:06:43,084
The casualties among our men!

1007
02:06:44,396 --> 02:06:47,367
Masakatsu Sugita... Sobei Umemura...

1008
02:06:47,435 --> 02:06:50,132
Ichiro Shinmen... Uemon Yoshioka...

1009
02:06:50,205 --> 02:06:52,197
died in action

1010
02:06:52,275 --> 02:06:54,301
Eight others suffer injuries

1011
02:06:57,282 --> 02:07:04,589
The ex-warrior from Geishu,
Hanshiro Tsugumo, died of hara-kiri

1012
02:07:06,729 --> 02:07:10,564
Our retainers died of illness

1013
02:07:11,903 --> 02:07:14,965
No retainer of the Iyi Clan was killed or maimed

1014
02:07:15,374 --> 02:07:19,506
by this impoverished ex-warrior!

1015
02:07:22,517 --> 02:07:26,512
At his own request,

1016
02:07:26,590 --> 02:07:30,585
ex-warrior Hanshiro Tsugumo performed hara-kiri!

1017
02:07:30,829 --> 02:07:32,729
Our men died of illness!

1018
02:07:32,798 --> 02:07:35,462
There can be no connection!

1019
02:07:40,176 --> 02:07:44,410
See that none other dies of illness

1020
02:07:44,482 --> 02:07:48,351
The injured must be given treatment
immediately!

1021
02:07:59,870 --> 02:08:02,361
Hon. Elder... I return

1022
02:08:05,812 --> 02:08:13,916
Omodaka... Hikokuro... died last night at
his residence

1023
02:08:16,526 --> 02:08:20,259
The two others, Kawabe and Yazaki,

1024
02:08:20,332 --> 02:08:23,792
still claim illness... but...

1025
02:08:23,871 --> 02:08:25,736
Foolish one!

1026
02:08:26,875 --> 02:08:30,869
Why did you not order them to die?

1027
02:08:31,148 --> 02:08:35,449
Go immediately... order them to die by hara-kiri!

1028
02:08:36,922 --> 02:08:39,414
And... take some skilled men with you!

1029
02:08:39,926 --> 02:08:41,758
Should they refuse,

1030
02:08:41,829 --> 02:08:44,958
they are to be slain on the spot! Understand!

1031
02:08:46,403 --> 02:08:50,501
Also, these men... Omodaka, too,

1032
02:08:50,575 --> 02:08:55,014
are victims of illness... not hara-kiri!

1033
02:08:56,450 --> 02:08:58,043
Stupid one!

1034
02:09:00,221 --> 02:09:03,248
You know the ways of administration...

1035
02:09:03,326 --> 02:09:07,628
You fall to realize the implications?

1036
02:09:08,032 --> 02:09:09,660
You idiot!

1037
02:09:10,270 --> 02:09:12,262
I go now, sire

1038
02:10:41,332 --> 02:10:45,633
Geishu ex-warrior, Hanshiro Tsugumo,

1039
02:10:46,772 --> 02:10:51,007
died by hara-kiri in the early evening

1040
02:10:51,813 --> 02:10:55,409
His words and actions markedly odd

1041
02:10:55,619 --> 02:10:59,351
Many considered him as being out of his mind

1042
02:11:01,727 --> 02:11:03,957
Also, disposition of Geishu ex-warrior,

1043
02:11:04,364 --> 02:11:09,565
Motome Chijiiwa, who died in January,

1044
02:11:10,874 --> 02:11:12,603
was found appropriate

1045
02:11:13,744 --> 02:11:17,044
and the fame of the House of Iyi was
greatly enhanced

1046
02:11:19,619 --> 02:11:23,148
In this case also,

1047
02:11:23,758 --> 02:11:25,522
our stern measures were soon known

1048
02:11:25,594 --> 02:11:27,222
throughout the administration

1049
02:11:27,296 --> 02:11:28,696
Consequently,

1050
02:11:29,299 --> 02:11:30,733
three days later,

1051
02:11:31,402 --> 02:11:36,341
during formal session at the Castle,

1052
02:11:36,409 --> 02:11:43,250
His Lordship took occasion to laud our hon.
Heir Bennosuke

1053
02:11:45,022 --> 02:11:47,924
...in peace as in turbulence...

1054
02:11:49,260 --> 02:11:51,662
With this borne in mind

1055
02:11:52,132 --> 02:11:56,126
the House of Iyi will prosper
throughout the ages

1056
02:11:57,806 --> 02:12:03,610
May 16th, 1630... 7th Year of Kan-Ei
