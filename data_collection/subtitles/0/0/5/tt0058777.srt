1
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,111
The Secretary of State for War
received the following dispatch

2
00:01:34,281 --> 00:01:39,500
from Lord Chelmsford, Commander-in-Chief of
Her Majesty's forces in Natal, South Africa.

3
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:45,700
"I regret to report a disastrous engagement which
took place on the morning of the 22nd of January

4
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:48,900
between the armies of
the Zulu king Cetewayo

5
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
and our Number 3 Column,
consisting of Five Companies of the

6
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:56,700
1st Battalion, 24th Regiment of Foot,
and one company of the 2nd Battalion,

7
00:01:56,800 --> 00:02:02,100
a total of nearly 1,500 men,
officers and other ranks. "

8
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,200
"The Zulus, in overwhelming numbers,
launched a highly disciplined attack

9
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,700
on the slopes of the mountain
ISANDHLWANA,

10
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:12,700
and in spite of gallant
resistance... "

11
00:05:15,727 --> 00:05:18,036
What did he ask, Father?

12
00:05:18,127 --> 00:05:21,040
Whether a man of God
like myself was pleased

13
00:05:21,128 --> 00:05:25,919
to see so many warriors married
to so many maidens at one time.

14
00:05:26,009 --> 00:05:28,921
How can he imagine
it would please anyone?

15
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,808
Do you think I said it
pleased me, daughter?

16
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:37,920
I told him I was unhappy to see so many
brides who may soon become widows.

17
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:41,723
That was a very good answer, Father.

18
00:07:44,027 --> 00:07:48,305
Why do they have those
little spears? The girls, I mean?

19
00:07:49,867 --> 00:07:53,702
It's a symbol of their
chastity, daughter.

20
00:08:15,711 --> 00:08:20,866
It's splendid, I know, but
it's quite horrible too, isn't it?

21
00:08:21,952 --> 00:08:26,310
The Book says, "What went she
out into the wilderness to see?"

22
00:08:26,393 --> 00:08:30,181
- "A man clothed in soft raiment?"
- Yes, Father.

23
00:09:09,678 --> 00:09:13,831
You must understand these things
if you're going to stay in Africa.

24
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:18,550
That's why I brought you here.
They are a great people, daughter.

25
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,431
But how can they let themselves
be married in droves?

26
00:09:23,521 --> 00:09:27,230
Young girls to... to old men.

27
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:32,475
In Europe, young women accept
arranged marriages with rich men.

28
00:09:32,561 --> 00:09:37,431
Perhaps the Zulu girls are luckier.
Getting a brave man.

29
00:10:43,011 --> 00:10:44,650
Margareta.

30
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:04,331
- O Lord in heaven!
- What is it? Father?

31
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,532
1,000 British soldiers
have been massacred.

32
00:11:07,615 --> 00:11:11,767
While I stood here talking peace,
a war has started.

33
00:11:15,575 --> 00:11:18,612
Ishiwan!
Didn't you say that Ishiwan...

34
00:11:18,735 --> 00:11:22,172
Yes. It's their name for our mission
station at Rorke's Drift.

35
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:24,896
- They're going to destroy it.
- Why?

36
00:11:24,977 --> 00:11:29,926
There are British soldiers
at Rorke's Drift.

37
00:11:31,538 --> 00:11:35,770
- It's a hospital. Tell him.
- Do you think he will listen?

38
00:11:35,858 --> 00:11:39,647
We must get there.
There'll be a massacre.

39
00:12:43,827 --> 00:12:47,582
- Alright, Corporal Allen.
- Sir. Corp? Let go.

40
00:14:01,558 --> 00:14:03,549
Right turn.

41
00:14:05,598 --> 00:14:07,590
Quick march.

42
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,673
Colour Sergeant Bourne,
what's that shooting?

43
00:14:25,761 --> 00:14:28,116
A rifle, Hughes.

44
00:14:28,201 --> 00:14:32,275
If you're sick in hospital,
I suggest you lie down.

45
00:14:43,403 --> 00:14:46,520
Hookie, who's doing
all that shooting?

46
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:49,482
- Who do you think?
- Who do you think?

47
00:14:49,564 --> 00:14:54,036
Mr Bromhead is shooting defenceless
animals for the officers' dinner.

48
00:15:26,049 --> 00:15:28,803
I wish he'd bring us
some fresh meat.

49
00:15:30,010 --> 00:15:32,205
I wonder what they're
cooking for supper.

50
00:15:32,290 --> 00:15:36,169
Same as usual.
Horse meat and axle grease.

51
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:41,922
Which one has got the bullet?

52
00:15:59,214 --> 00:16:00,851
Shut up, you cripple!

53
00:16:08,855 --> 00:16:10,811
Come on, make your mind up.

54
00:16:10,895 --> 00:16:14,889
- It's turning blue.
- Yes, very pretty. Which one?

55
00:16:16,056 --> 00:16:17,614
It's under that one.

56
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:23,533
The boy's clever. The boy's good.
How about putting some money on?

57
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,493
Five rounds!

58
00:16:25,576 --> 00:16:27,408
Independent! Fire!

59
00:16:27,497 --> 00:16:29,488
Stuff me with green apples.

60
00:16:29,577 --> 00:16:32,729
If a dog was as sick as him,
they'd shoot him.

61
00:16:36,978 --> 00:16:39,652
Shut up, you rotten, sick...

62
00:16:39,739 --> 00:16:42,207
Why don't you leave him alone?

63
00:16:45,260 --> 00:16:47,410
He's sick enough. You'll kill him!

64
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:51,891
Wouldn't bother Hookie, would it?
Wouldn't bother if Maxfield was dead.

65
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:55,257
I don't care if you were
all dead. Blimey!

66
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:59,700
Rorke's Drift.
It'd take an Irishman

67
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:05,295
to give his name to a rotten,
stinking middle-of-nowhere hole like this.

68
00:17:31,946 --> 00:17:34,016
Hold that pont!

69
00:17:40,667 --> 00:17:42,818
- Get some men in the water!
- Sir.

70
00:17:50,428 --> 00:17:53,785
You heard that officer of Engineers.
Get it.

71
00:18:12,951 --> 00:18:16,501
Heave! Put a bit more weight
on that rope, you men.

72
00:18:17,432 --> 00:18:20,230
He's even got a voice like a corporal.

73
00:18:20,312 --> 00:18:24,352
Sort of like a female
hippopotamus in labour.

74
00:18:52,317 --> 00:18:56,026
- Hot work?
- Damned hot work.

75
00:18:56,958 --> 00:19:00,109
Still, the river cools
you off a bit, though?

76
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:05,911
- Who are you?
- John Chard. Royal Engineers.

77
00:19:05,998 --> 00:19:11,915
Bromhead. 24th.
That's my post, up there.

78
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:18,355
- You've come down from the column?
- They want a bridge across the river.

79
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,959
Who said you could use my men?

80
00:19:23,841 --> 00:19:26,276
They were sitting on their
backsides doing nothing.

81
00:19:28,201 --> 00:19:31,239
I'd rather you asked first, old boy.

82
00:19:31,322 --> 00:19:34,394
I was told their officer
was out hunting.

83
00:19:44,364 --> 00:19:47,197
Yes. I'll tell my man to clean your kit.

84
00:19:47,284 --> 00:19:50,277
- Don't bother.
- No bother.

85
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:52,878
I'm not offering to clean it myself.

86
00:19:52,964 --> 00:19:57,595
A chap ought to look smart
in front of the men.

87
00:19:57,685 --> 00:20:02,316
Well, chin-chin. Do carry on
with your mud pies.

88
00:20:15,488 --> 00:20:17,480
You.

89
00:20:17,569 --> 00:20:19,559
- What's your name?
- Owen.

90
00:20:23,088 --> 00:20:26,047
- Are you supposed to be here?
- Yes, sir.

91
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:29,406
Well, not exactly. You see, sir...

92
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:32,209
Only, you've got my
solo tenor out there.

93
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:37,244
- I've got your what?
- 612 Williams, sir.

94
00:20:37,331 --> 00:20:40,927
We were going to practise this
afternoon with the company choir.

95
00:20:41,012 --> 00:20:45,084
But you've got my only solo tenor
working in the cold water.

96
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,845
Well, I hope he sings
better than he works.

97
00:20:49,732 --> 00:20:52,452
Indeed, sir. He does.

98
00:20:57,053 --> 00:21:01,332
Every piece of wood in this
blistering country's eaten by ants.

99
00:21:01,414 --> 00:21:05,203
The heat and the dust, sir.
Very nasty on the larynx.

100
00:21:08,055 --> 00:21:10,365
Mr Bromhead lets you have a choir?

101
00:21:10,456 --> 00:21:13,015
Every Welsh regiment has a choir, sir.

102
00:21:13,095 --> 00:21:17,533
Mr Bromhead is English,
but he is a proper gentleman.

103
00:21:17,616 --> 00:21:19,766
There's no doubt of that.

104
00:21:20,656 --> 00:21:24,616
- And what do you sing?
- Me, sir? Baritone, sir.

105
00:21:25,217 --> 00:21:27,015
Good.

106
00:21:27,098 --> 00:21:30,408
I can find work for baritones
as well as tenors.

107
00:21:40,899 --> 00:21:45,655
See what you make of that.
Below the escarpment. Two riders.

108
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:48,049
Gallopers from the column, sir?

109
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:52,695
Very wonderful things,
these, sir, aren't they?

110
00:22:01,623 --> 00:22:04,341
Get your party ashore at the double.

111
00:22:04,422 --> 00:22:09,781
You heard that officer of Engineers.
Make fast and back to the bank. Move.

112
00:22:10,783 --> 00:22:12,421
Come on, lad.

113
00:22:27,786 --> 00:22:30,619
- Trouble, sir?
- Could be.

114
00:22:30,706 --> 00:22:33,345
I can anchor the ponts midstream.

115
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:36,339
This is a situation you think
an Engineer officer can't handle?

116
00:22:36,427 --> 00:22:39,066
- No, sir. Beg your pardon, sir.
- Fall them in.

117
00:22:39,147 --> 00:22:41,820
We ain't finished the bridge, sir.

118
00:22:41,907 --> 00:22:44,661
- Fall them in, Corporal.
- Sir.

119
00:22:50,949 --> 00:22:55,818
Get fell in, you men.
Squad. Squad, 'shun.

120
00:22:55,909 --> 00:22:58,139
Left turn.

121
00:22:58,229 --> 00:23:01,108
Left wheel. By the left.
Quick march.

122
00:23:30,114 --> 00:23:33,265
Hey, you! What's going on down there?

123
00:23:34,875 --> 00:23:38,185
- They're building barricades.
- What's that?

124
00:23:45,236 --> 00:23:48,626
Ride like hell. Tell them
they can't get here too soon.

125
00:23:51,717 --> 00:23:55,073
Corporal, I want all
these people out of here.

126
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:57,592
Douse these fires
and turn the boilers over.

127
00:23:57,678 --> 00:23:59,748
- They've got soup in them.
- Pour it on the fires.

128
00:23:59,838 --> 00:24:03,149
- Get a rifle.
- A rifle? But I don't...

129
00:24:05,599 --> 00:24:08,557
- Mr Chard? - Commissary Dalton, is it?
- That is correct.

130
00:24:08,639 --> 00:24:12,473
- You've just asked this man...
- To pour the soup on the fires.

131
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,438
See that he does it. All these bags
of maize inside the perimeter.

132
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,637
I don't want these tents
providing cover for the enemy.

133
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:22,839
Does he know what it's like to make
soup for 100 men in this heat?

134
00:24:22,921 --> 00:24:30,311
Don't distress yourself, dear fellow.
There's your own officer.

135
00:24:36,643 --> 00:24:40,875
Chard? This is Adendorff,
Natal Native Contingent.

136
00:24:43,764 --> 00:24:45,675
You've come from there?

137
00:24:47,644 --> 00:24:50,955
Alright, man, is it true?

138
00:24:51,045 --> 00:24:54,799
Beg your pardon, sir.
About the soup, sir.

139
00:24:56,646 --> 00:24:58,716
What about the soup?

140
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:02,516
This gentleman, sir,
said to put it on the fire.

141
00:25:03,687 --> 00:25:06,564
- He did?
- We have thatched roofs here.

142
00:25:06,646 --> 00:25:10,083
No need to make the Zulus
a present of fire.

143
00:25:13,928 --> 00:25:15,520
Then get on with it.

144
00:25:15,608 --> 00:25:19,887
- There's a good fellow.
- Am I to take a rifle, too, sir?

145
00:25:20,609 --> 00:25:23,282
The entire column.

146
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:27,162
- It's damned impossible. 800 men?
- 1,200 men.

147
00:25:27,250 --> 00:25:29,843
There were 400 native levies also.

148
00:25:29,930 --> 00:25:33,240
Damn the levies.
More cowardly blacks.

149
00:25:34,730 --> 00:25:38,644
Cowardly blacks?
They died on your side.

150
00:25:38,731 --> 00:25:44,284
Who do you think is coming to wipe out
your command, the Grenadier Guards?

151
00:25:46,532 --> 00:25:48,285
What the deuce is
the matter with him?

152
00:25:52,093 --> 00:25:55,530
- Adendorff? Are you staying?
- Is there anywhere else to go?

153
00:25:55,613 --> 00:26:00,130
Talk to our levies, will you?
Tell them whose side they're on.

154
00:26:14,016 --> 00:26:15,768
Did the runner bring orders?

155
00:26:15,856 --> 00:26:19,247
He brought orders to
the commander of this post.

156
00:26:19,337 --> 00:26:22,534
- To do what?
- To hold our ground.

157
00:26:30,898 --> 00:26:33,891
What military genius
thought up that one?

158
00:26:33,979 --> 00:26:39,258
Somebody's son and heir, who got
a commission before he could shave?

159
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:44,493
I rather fancy that he's
nobody's son and heir now.

160
00:27:02,623 --> 00:27:05,695
- Who are they?
- The Witts.

161
00:27:05,783 --> 00:27:09,493
The Swedish missionaries here.
This is their station.

162
00:27:13,144 --> 00:27:16,978
They've chosen a damned odd
time for a prayer meeting.

163
00:27:35,627 --> 00:27:38,142
I think you better get
them out of here.

164
00:27:38,228 --> 00:27:40,616
Are you giving me an order, old boy?

165
00:27:47,428 --> 00:27:51,024
Bromhead, let's get one thing clear.
I'm no line officer. I'm an engineer.

166
00:27:51,109 --> 00:27:54,499
- I came here to build a bridge.
- Lucky for you.

167
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:58,060
Otherwise, you would've been chopped
with the rest of the column.

168
00:28:00,591 --> 00:28:03,742
Alright. What's the date
of your commission?

169
00:28:06,391 --> 00:28:11,226
Now don't tell me.
I suppose you have seniority.

170
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:14,110
1872. May.

171
00:28:15,352 --> 00:28:18,584
1872. February.

172
00:28:18,673 --> 00:28:23,702
Oh, well. I suppose there
are such things as gifted amateurs.

173
00:28:23,794 --> 00:28:28,500
- You question my right to command?
- Not your right. Never mind.

174
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:34,306
We can... cooperate, as they say.

175
00:28:39,115 --> 00:28:41,755
- I'll be here, won't I?
- Bromhead?

176
00:28:48,397 --> 00:28:52,185
Have you been here long
enough to put a lookout on that hill?

177
00:28:54,358 --> 00:28:57,235
Erm... Not since we've been chatting, no.

178
00:29:02,758 --> 00:29:08,277
I've started the barricades, though.
I managed to think of that.

179
00:29:08,359 --> 00:29:10,078
Who's the sergeant with the muscles?

180
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,759
Sgt Windridge. Good man.

181
00:29:18,241 --> 00:29:19,720
Not you again?

182
00:29:19,801 --> 00:29:22,635
Yes, sir, Surgeon Reynolds.
It's my arm, sir.

183
00:29:22,722 --> 00:29:25,315
The only trouble is
you never work with it.

184
00:29:25,401 --> 00:29:28,041
Pretty terrible pain, sir.

185
00:29:28,122 --> 00:29:30,590
Alright. Off with your vest.

186
00:29:31,762 --> 00:29:34,197
- Now, sir?
- Now, sir.

187
00:29:40,244 --> 00:29:42,633
It's cruel to bend, sir.

188
00:29:44,244 --> 00:29:47,157
You know what you've got there,
my malingering Hector?

189
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:49,712
No, sir. Hook's the name, sir.

190
00:29:49,804 --> 00:29:52,763
You've got a fine,
handsome boil, my friend.

191
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:56,441
There's one glistening boil
for every soldier in Africa.

192
00:29:56,526 --> 00:30:01,554
You may not win many medals, but
you'll certainly get more boils.

193
00:30:01,646 --> 00:30:05,435
For every gunshot wound I probe,
I expect to lance three boils.

194
00:30:05,527 --> 00:30:07,757
Medicinal brandy would set me up.

195
00:30:07,848 --> 00:30:09,440
Brandy's for heroes.

196
00:30:09,528 --> 00:30:15,080
The rest of you will make do with
boils, flies, and dysentery.

197
00:30:16,208 --> 00:30:21,408
Now. This is going to hurt you a lot
more than it will me, I'm happy to say.

198
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:31,527
Mr Bromhead? Cetewayo is coming
with two impies to destroy you.

199
00:30:31,611 --> 00:30:37,005
You must talk to It Chard, Mr Witt.
He commands here. Margareta.

200
00:30:37,092 --> 00:30:41,403
I am ready to take away your sick
and wounded. Please supply the wagons.

201
00:30:41,491 --> 00:30:46,407
- Daughter, tell the men to get ready.
- One moment, Miss Margareta. Mr Witt?

202
00:30:47,972 --> 00:30:50,851
I don't suppose you hold
the Queen's commission?

203
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,730
I am a man of peace, sir.

204
00:30:52,813 --> 00:31:00,210
Allow a Queen's officer to give orders.
How do you know what Cetewayo is doing?

205
00:31:00,295 --> 00:31:04,413
We have just come from his kraal.
He's a member of my parish.

206
00:31:06,296 --> 00:31:10,971
Your parish? Are you sure you're on
the right side of the river?

207
00:31:12,376 --> 00:31:15,766
I am here to do my duty.
I expect your cooperation.

208
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:20,088
What's our strength?

209
00:31:20,177 --> 00:31:25,206
Seven officers, including surgeon,
commissaries. And Adendorff.

210
00:31:25,298 --> 00:31:27,687
Wounded and sick, 36.

211
00:31:27,778 --> 00:31:32,488
Fit for duty, 97.
And about 40 native levies.

212
00:31:32,578 --> 00:31:34,615
Not much of an army for you.

213
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:40,331
There are 4,000 Zulus coming against you.
You must abandon this mission.

214
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:46,300
- Adendorff sent his trooper to Helpmekaar.

215
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,935
There's a relief column there.
- There was, 3 days ago.

216
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:57,541
Mr Bromhead, issue our walking
wounded with arms and ammunition.

217
00:31:57,622 --> 00:32:03,174
You will all be killed.
And the sick in their beds. All of you.

218
00:32:03,262 --> 00:32:07,859
I don't think so. The army doesn't
like more than one disaster in a day.

219
00:32:07,943 --> 00:32:12,699
Looks bad in the newspapers and
upsets civilians at their breakfast.

220
00:32:13,584 --> 00:32:17,419
Sir, the Book says, "There is no king

221
00:32:17,505 --> 00:32:23,024
that can be saved by
the multitude of a host... "

222
00:32:23,786 --> 00:32:29,144
When I have the impertinence to deliver
a sermon, then you may tell me my duty.

223
00:32:29,226 --> 00:32:32,024
It is not your duty
to sacrifice the sick.

224
00:32:32,106 --> 00:32:34,416
Are you a student of
tactics too, Miss Witt?

225
00:32:34,507 --> 00:32:36,782
Are you a Christian?

226
00:32:39,508 --> 00:32:43,865
- It is your duty to let us take those
men away. - Not that way, Miss Witt.

227
00:32:52,069 --> 00:32:57,144
Put 2 good men on that hill.
Tell them to keep their eyes peeled.

228
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:59,141
- Mr Bromhead, sir?
- Double up, dammit!

229
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:03,224
Carry on, Sgt Windridge,
there's a good fellow.

230
00:33:09,832 --> 00:33:13,109
I had a calf like you once,
back home in Merioneth.

231
00:33:13,953 --> 00:33:17,627
I'll get you some milk.
I'll make you strong.

232
00:33:17,712 --> 00:33:19,863
Would you like that, then?

233
00:33:22,153 --> 00:33:26,272
What the hell do you think
you're doing? Shut up!

234
00:33:39,436 --> 00:33:42,155
- You've got a voice?
- Yes, baritone, Sergeant.

235
00:33:42,236 --> 00:33:46,832
Get up on that hill and
sing out if you see anything.

236
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:48,555
You too.

237
00:33:49,477 --> 00:33:53,026
And take your bandook,
you dozy Welshman!

238
00:34:02,679 --> 00:34:07,037
The classical attack of the Zulus
is in the shape of a bull buffalo.

239
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:12,035
The head, the horns and the loins.

240
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:16,193
First, the head moves forward.
The enemy moves in to meet it.

241
00:34:16,280 --> 00:34:18,351
But it's only a feint.

242
00:34:18,441 --> 00:34:22,150
The warriors in the head disperse
to form the encircling horns.

243
00:34:22,241 --> 00:34:28,352
The enemy is drawn in on the loins.
The horns close in on the back and sides.

244
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:33,074
Finish.

245
00:34:35,923 --> 00:34:39,040
It looks jolly simple, doesn't it?

246
00:34:39,123 --> 00:34:42,196
It's jolly deadly, old boy.

247
00:34:43,884 --> 00:34:46,763
Well done. We'll make
an Englishman of you yet.

248
00:34:46,845 --> 00:34:48,756
No, thanks. I'm a Boer.

249
00:34:48,845 --> 00:34:53,124
The Zulus are the enemies of
my blood. What are you doing here?

250
00:34:53,206 --> 00:34:55,117
You don't object to our help?

251
00:34:56,326 --> 00:34:59,239
It depends what you damned English
want for it afterwards.

252
00:34:59,327 --> 00:35:02,762
Alright. Hospital. Church.

253
00:35:03,327 --> 00:35:05,318
Cattle kraal. Stables.

254
00:35:05,407 --> 00:35:08,763
An outside perimeter
joining the buildings here and here.

255
00:35:09,568 --> 00:35:12,162
We don't move out to meet
the feint of the buffalo head.

256
00:35:12,248 --> 00:35:19,200
We hold the outside perimeter.
If that collapses, we move back here.

257
00:35:19,289 --> 00:35:23,363
- How high can you build a wall?
- It should be shoulder high.

258
00:35:23,450 --> 00:35:26,647
But if the fuzzies moved out
of Isandhlwana immediately,

259
00:35:26,730 --> 00:35:29,198
they could be here, well, now.

260
00:35:29,290 --> 00:35:31,884
It's just a matter of time.

261
00:35:36,131 --> 00:35:37,929
We'll have to make the time.

262
00:35:41,692 --> 00:35:47,529
Your plan is to stand behind a few feet
of mealie bags, and wait for the attack?

263
00:35:48,973 --> 00:35:51,488
That's right. We wait.

264
00:35:51,574 --> 00:35:55,123
If 1,200 men couldn't hold
a defensive position this morning,

265
00:35:55,214 --> 00:35:58,172
what chance have we with 100?

266
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:04,247
Listen, I'll take the company
up into the hills.

267
00:36:04,335 --> 00:36:06,565
I know how to disperse them.

268
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:11,291
Ambush, you see?
We cut them down in the passes.

269
00:36:11,376 --> 00:36:14,414
Bromhead? I want that
line of boxes across here,

270
00:36:14,497 --> 00:36:18,171
from the cattle kraal
to the outside perimeter.

271
00:36:18,737 --> 00:36:22,252
If they get over this... redoubt.

272
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:32,210
And a final redoubt here.

273
00:36:53,142 --> 00:36:54,700
Put it in the middle.

274
00:36:54,782 --> 00:36:56,898
What are you doing in here?

275
00:36:58,222 --> 00:37:02,216
This is a church! Don't you realise,
this is an altar table?

276
00:37:02,303 --> 00:37:05,057
I'm sorry. There's nothing larger.
We need it now.

277
00:37:05,144 --> 00:37:07,135
There's no chloroform.

278
00:37:07,224 --> 00:37:10,660
Go to the hospital.
Tell the sick to be ready to leave.

279
00:37:10,744 --> 00:37:15,056
I want cold water, lots of it,
a probe, a saw, some nitric acid.

280
00:37:15,944 --> 00:37:17,856
Don't take it too badly, Mr Witt.

281
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:22,178
Isn't this as good a place as any
for a man to be when he's in pain?

282
00:38:16,313 --> 00:38:19,863
Excuse me, sir. Tuck your heads in
afore they fall off.

283
00:38:19,954 --> 00:38:24,072
Sorry, sir. I have orders
to get some of these bags outside.

284
00:38:24,154 --> 00:38:26,385
Alright, get on with it.

285
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:30,308
I was praying that your officer
may turn to God's word.

286
00:38:30,394 --> 00:38:34,991
That's right, sir. A prayer's as good
as a bayonet on a day like this.

287
00:38:35,075 --> 00:38:38,273
- Have you prayed?
- There'll be a time for it, sir.

288
00:38:38,356 --> 00:38:40,187
What will you say?

289
00:38:42,036 --> 00:38:47,430
Bit of the Psalms, I suppose.
My father was a lay preacher.

290
00:38:47,517 --> 00:38:50,157
A great one for the Psalms, he was.

291
00:38:50,238 --> 00:38:54,914
There was one that might
have been written for a soldier.

292
00:38:54,998 --> 00:38:58,707
Say it, man. Lift your voice to God.

293
00:38:58,798 --> 00:39:02,314
- Now, sir?
- Yes. Let them hear your voice.

294
00:39:02,399 --> 00:39:03,991
They know my voice.

295
00:39:04,079 --> 00:39:10,713
Let them hear it now in praise of the Lord.
Call upon him, man, for your salvation.

296
00:39:12,281 --> 00:39:16,718
As far as I can remember, sir,
it goes something like this.

297
00:39:16,801 --> 00:39:21,636
"He maketh wars to cease in all
the world; he breaketh the bow

298
00:39:21,721 --> 00:39:26,352
and snappeth the spear in sunder. "
D'you know it, sir?

299
00:39:26,442 --> 00:39:29,275
"I shall be exalted among the heathen,

300
00:39:29,363 --> 00:39:33,561
I shall be exalted in the earth.
The Lord of hosts is with us. "

301
00:39:33,643 --> 00:39:35,635
That's it, sir.

302
00:39:42,685 --> 00:39:48,715
Nobody told you to stop working.
You lead-backsided... Get sweating.

303
00:39:51,125 --> 00:39:55,244
I've been thinking.
I've got it all sorted out.

304
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,117
Company!

305
00:40:02,647 --> 00:40:04,718
What are you doing here, Miss?

306
00:40:07,688 --> 00:40:11,203
He doesn't need any help.
I'll look after him.

307
00:40:13,728 --> 00:40:15,720
Won't I?

308
00:40:18,849 --> 00:40:21,887
You are all to be evacuated
soon in the wagons.

309
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,881
- Who says?
- My father.

310
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:28,885
That's nice, isn't it? Your father.

311
00:40:28,971 --> 00:40:32,646
You and me, Hookie.
Mr Chard's orders. In this room.

312
00:40:34,932 --> 00:40:36,922
Here we are.

313
00:40:42,532 --> 00:40:45,923
What are you talking about?
I'm sick. I'm excused duty.

314
00:40:46,653 --> 00:40:48,211
What are you doing?

315
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,525
I'm making a loophole, see?

316
00:40:51,614 --> 00:40:54,492
Me and Hookie's gonna fight in here.

317
00:40:54,574 --> 00:40:59,603
You're joking, I'm sick! Nobody's got any
right to ask me to muck around in a battle.

318
00:40:59,695 --> 00:41:01,367
I'm getting out.

319
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,729
I know you, Hook.

320
00:41:13,817 --> 00:41:15,808
Yeah, you ought to.

321
00:41:16,377 --> 00:41:18,368
You're no good, Hook.

322
00:41:21,738 --> 00:41:25,129
They gave us you because
you are no good to anyone

323
00:41:25,219 --> 00:41:27,813
except the Queen and Sgt Maxfield.

324
00:41:28,698 --> 00:41:31,452
Thank you very much, the both of you.

325
00:41:35,979 --> 00:41:39,450
Take this rifle, Hook, and get to it!

326
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,531
I'll make a soldier of you yet.

327
00:41:56,102 --> 00:42:00,779
What for? Did I ever see a Zulu
walk down the City Road? No!

328
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:02,774
So what am I doing here?

329
00:42:02,863 --> 00:42:07,460
You are here because you were a thief.
And you still are one...

330
00:42:07,544 --> 00:42:10,536
- Certainly.
- Hook, my lad.

331
00:42:11,985 --> 00:42:16,501
And now, you can be a soldier,
like what they pay you for.

332
00:42:16,585 --> 00:42:22,854
You got me 28 days' field punishment
in Brecon. Isn't that enough?

333
00:42:24,706 --> 00:42:27,140
Pick up the bayonet and help Williams.

334
00:42:34,187 --> 00:42:36,258
And put your tunic on!

335
00:43:17,233 --> 00:43:20,066
28 days' field punishment. No pay.

336
00:43:21,034 --> 00:43:24,822
Know what he did?
Sent money to my missus.

337
00:43:25,794 --> 00:43:27,786
What did you do that for?

338
00:43:28,715 --> 00:43:30,387
You hate him for it?

339
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:33,627
What do you want me to do?
Cry my heart out?

340
00:43:33,716 --> 00:43:35,707
Give him a big kiss?

341
00:43:43,636 --> 00:43:46,674
I thought you might pray for him.

342
00:43:48,357 --> 00:43:50,713
She's a dry one. Very cool.

343
00:43:53,198 --> 00:43:55,428
You know what she needs.

344
00:43:55,518 --> 00:43:59,114
Play your cards right,
and it could be you.

345
00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:10,439
Can I help anyone?

346
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:15,831
There will be wagons soon
to take you away.

347
00:44:16,881 --> 00:44:20,670
He's dying.
There's nothing you can do.

348
00:44:22,322 --> 00:44:24,313
Nothing?
There must be.

349
00:44:26,243 --> 00:44:27,995
- 'Shun!
- Pay attention.

350
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:31,155
Are there any walking
sick without rifles?

351
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:33,682
Me.

352
00:44:34,643 --> 00:44:37,477
You, Dutchy?
You couldn't walk to the latrine.

353
00:44:37,564 --> 00:44:39,759
This is not my first action. Come on.

354
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:42,643
Are you expecting sick men to fight?

355
00:44:55,127 --> 00:45:00,326
- What's he going to do, 593?
- I think he wants to be a hero, 716.

356
00:45:00,407 --> 00:45:04,241
Haven't you red necks got
names instead of numbers?

357
00:45:04,327 --> 00:45:09,448
This is a Welsh regiment, man.
Though there are some english in it.

358
00:45:09,528 --> 00:45:13,761
I am Jones from Bwlchgwyn.
He is Jones from Builth Wells.

359
00:45:13,849 --> 00:45:19,049
There are 4 more Joneses in C Company.
Confusing, isn't it, Dutchy?

360
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,406
What's your name, then?

361
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,720
It's Schiess. And I'm
not Dutch. I'm Swiss.

362
00:45:30,291 --> 00:45:33,806
There's a silly man, by damn.
He's got himself into a private war.

363
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:37,009
I belong to Natal Mounted Police.

364
00:45:37,092 --> 00:45:42,247
Is that true, then? He's a peeler,
716. Come to arrest the Zulus.

365
00:45:42,333 --> 00:45:44,642
What do you know about Zulus?

366
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:46,292
Bunch of savages.

367
00:45:50,933 --> 00:45:54,244
Alright, how far can you
red necks march in a day?

368
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:56,290
15, 20 miles, is it?

369
00:45:56,374 --> 00:46:01,005
A Zulu regiment can run 50 miles
and fight a battle at the end of it.

370
00:46:01,095 --> 00:46:06,011
There's daft. I don't see no sense
in running to fight a battle.

371
00:46:11,457 --> 00:46:14,529
What are you doing here?
Why don't you go?

372
00:46:14,617 --> 00:46:17,256
No. Not until you have gone.

373
00:46:17,897 --> 00:46:21,732
You know Cetewayo has a regiment
of young girls, warriors,

374
00:46:21,818 --> 00:46:25,128
called Ripen At Noon.

375
00:46:26,379 --> 00:46:27,858
There's pretty.

376
00:46:28,699 --> 00:46:35,378
Hey, come on. Come on. Here.
Give us... Just a little kiss?

377
00:47:14,065 --> 00:47:15,862
Hey, boys! Take a look at this.

378
00:47:17,785 --> 00:47:20,937
- What is it, boyo?
- Flaming dust. What else?

379
00:47:21,026 --> 00:47:23,062
No, by damn, it's horses!

380
00:47:30,868 --> 00:47:36,147
- The cavalry! - It's the relief column,
you long-range sniper, you.

381
00:48:03,671 --> 00:48:08,268
Stephenson, Darnford's Horse.
I'm surprised you're still here.

382
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:10,423
There are 4,000 Zulus
coming this way.

383
00:48:10,513 --> 00:48:15,064
Can you throw out your men in a screen?
You know how Zulus feel about cavalry.

384
00:48:15,153 --> 00:48:20,865
I know how my men feel about Zulus.
We've just got through them.

385
00:48:20,954 --> 00:48:23,912
- What price, this?
- Your whole regiment's gone.

386
00:48:23,994 --> 00:48:27,225
Bromhead? You know this man.
Tell him we need him.

387
00:48:27,314 --> 00:48:29,431
I'm sorry. Look at my men.

388
00:48:29,515 --> 00:48:31,710
Stand fast, all of you!

389
00:48:31,795 --> 00:48:34,310
Where are they going?
Get them back here!

390
00:48:34,396 --> 00:48:37,194
- Let go of my bridle!
- Get them back here!

391
00:48:37,276 --> 00:48:39,791
If they're going to die,
they'll die on their own farms.

392
00:48:39,877 --> 00:48:42,789
You're the professionals.
You fight here if you want to.

393
00:48:42,877 --> 00:48:47,633
We need you! Don't go!
Don't go! Stay!

394
00:48:50,998 --> 00:48:52,909
We need you, damn you!

395
00:49:03,600 --> 00:49:05,955
You didn't say a single word to help.

396
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:09,317
When you take command, old boy,
you're on your own.

397
00:49:09,401 --> 00:49:13,872
The first lesson the General,
my grandfather, ever taught me.

398
00:50:02,488 --> 00:50:04,080
Alright, then.

399
00:50:05,528 --> 00:50:08,486
Nobody told you to stop working.

400
00:50:16,289 --> 00:50:22,365
Brothers! The way of the
Lord has been shown to us.

401
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:25,801
"Thou shalt not kill",
saith the Lord.

402
00:50:25,891 --> 00:50:28,086
Brothers!

403
00:50:30,412 --> 00:50:33,483
God's love is peace.

404
00:50:33,571 --> 00:50:35,528
- Colour Sergeant Bourne?
- Go in peace!

405
00:50:35,612 --> 00:50:40,561
Stay not to kill and
be killed. Go, I say.

406
00:50:46,934 --> 00:50:49,494
The sin of Cain will be upon you.

407
00:50:49,574 --> 00:50:52,612
"Am I my brother's keeper?"
asked Cain.

408
00:50:52,695 --> 00:50:56,847
Yea, we are all our brother's keeper.

409
00:50:59,455 --> 00:51:02,128
"The nations are but
a drop of a bucket,

410
00:51:02,295 --> 00:51:06,289
and are counted as the
small dust of the balance. "

411
00:51:09,977 --> 00:51:11,615
Bring him along.

412
00:51:18,938 --> 00:51:21,612
Mr Witt, I'm getting
you off this post.

413
00:51:21,699 --> 00:51:25,611
Sir, they've all
hopped it. All of them.

414
00:51:29,939 --> 00:51:33,376
Give me those wagons
and I will save the sick.

415
00:51:37,420 --> 00:51:39,491
You want the wagons?

416
00:51:39,581 --> 00:51:42,653
Mr Bourne? Windridge?
Get those wagons in.

417
00:51:43,501 --> 00:51:47,541
God loves a sinner
come to his understanding.

418
00:52:03,464 --> 00:52:05,455
Hey, we're in luck.

419
00:52:06,184 --> 00:52:09,973
Looks like the old parson
got Chard to let us go.

420
00:52:30,788 --> 00:52:32,779
Heave!

421
00:52:43,269 --> 00:52:45,464
Right, lads. Heave. Heave.

422
00:53:12,473 --> 00:53:15,590
O Lord God, give me strength!

423
00:53:16,753 --> 00:53:19,314
Oh, God! God forgive me.

424
00:53:20,674 --> 00:53:25,430
I have the strength of thousands
while the spirit of God is with me.

425
00:53:31,996 --> 00:53:34,556
Oh, God, forgive me.

426
00:53:34,636 --> 00:53:36,945
Get him away from here.

427
00:53:43,837 --> 00:53:46,830
Leave him alone!

428
00:53:50,318 --> 00:53:52,958
Animals! All of you! Animals!

429
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:59,434
We shall not go. If you send
us away, we shall come back.

430
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,591
Lock him in the storeroom.
Put a man on the door.

431
00:54:02,679 --> 00:54:04,830
Alright, men, get back to work.

432
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:07,838
And you...!

433
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:11,521
Put Miss Witt in the church
with Surgeon Reynolds.

434
00:54:34,444 --> 00:54:37,914
It was sad, you know. And sick.

435
00:54:38,004 --> 00:54:42,396
Had a battle coming, see?
Animals are very sensitive to noise.

436
00:54:42,485 --> 00:54:44,602
Why worry about a calf?

437
00:54:44,686 --> 00:54:47,644
I thought I was tired of farming.
No adventure in it.

438
00:54:48,926 --> 00:54:54,319
But this country's not a bit
as good as Bala and the lake there.

439
00:54:54,406 --> 00:54:57,717
Not really green, like.

440
00:54:58,567 --> 00:55:00,603
And the soil.

441
00:55:04,928 --> 00:55:06,919
There's no moisture in it.

442
00:55:09,129 --> 00:55:11,848
Nothing to hold a man in his grave.

443
00:55:27,011 --> 00:55:30,800
Chard? One of my men, Hook.
Do you know him?

444
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,725
In the hospital, malingering,
under arrest.

445
00:55:33,812 --> 00:55:37,772
He's a thief, a coward and
an insubordinate barrack-room lawyer.

446
00:55:37,853 --> 00:55:40,526
- And you've given him a rifle.
- What?

447
00:55:40,613 --> 00:55:44,572
In Queen's regulations,
it specifically states...

448
00:55:56,095 --> 00:55:58,086
Damn funny.

449
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,725
Like a... Like a train
in the distance.

450
00:56:34,181 --> 00:56:36,171
You were saying about Hook?

451
00:56:43,141 --> 00:56:47,738
Mr Bromhead, sir?
Sentries come in from the hill.

452
00:56:47,822 --> 00:56:49,858
Colour Sergeant?
You have something to report?

453
00:56:50,582 --> 00:56:52,096
- Sir?
- Then tell me.

454
00:56:55,383 --> 00:56:59,821
Very good, sir. The sentries
report Zulus to the southwest.

455
00:56:59,904 --> 00:57:01,700
Thousands of them.

456
00:57:08,945 --> 00:57:11,539
Alright, Colour Sergeant, stand to.

457
00:57:47,830 --> 00:57:50,584
Look to your front. Mark the orders.

458
00:57:51,151 --> 00:57:54,985
Mark the target when it comes.
Look to your front.

459
00:58:08,993 --> 00:58:12,269
- Hitch, do your tunic up.
- My tunic?

460
00:58:12,354 --> 00:58:15,187
Do it up. Where do you
think you are, man?

461
00:58:42,878 --> 00:58:45,345
Boy? You hear me, boy?

462
00:58:46,637 --> 00:58:49,835
Will you be Cain
and kill your brother?

463
00:58:49,918 --> 00:58:52,193
"Thou shalt not kill",
saith the Lord.

464
00:58:52,278 --> 00:58:55,954
You believe in the
Lord's word, don't you?

465
00:58:57,279 --> 00:59:01,114
Obey the word, boy. Obey the Lord.

466
00:59:02,440 --> 00:59:04,351
Go to the others.

467
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:07,274
Boy, go to the others.

468
00:59:13,641 --> 00:59:15,233
He's...

469
00:59:16,082 --> 00:59:19,233
- Mr Witt says...
- Never mind him, boy.

470
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:30,318
You get along back to
the ramparts with your mates.

471
00:59:41,045 --> 00:59:45,358
Mr Witt, sir? Be quiet now, will you?
There's a good gentleman.

472
00:59:45,446 --> 00:59:47,835
You'll upset the lads.

473
01:00:06,088 --> 01:00:09,604
- You know my father was at Waterloo.
- He was?

474
01:00:09,689 --> 01:00:12,408
- He got his colonelcy after that.
- Did he?

475
01:00:15,770 --> 01:00:18,125
And my great-grandfather,

476
01:00:18,210 --> 01:00:22,727
he was the johnny who knelt
beside Wolfe at Quebec.

477
01:00:22,811 --> 01:00:24,961
Did they make him a colonel too?

478
01:00:27,052 --> 01:00:30,168
No, you don't see what I'm driving at.

479
01:00:31,812 --> 01:00:35,725
You're telling me you're the
professional, I'm the amateur.

480
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:38,491
No. What I mean is...

481
01:00:38,573 --> 01:00:41,565
I mean, I wish right now,

482
01:00:42,213 --> 01:00:47,493
I were a damned ranker,
like Hook or Hitch.

483
01:00:48,615 --> 01:00:50,606
You're not, are you?

484
01:00:50,695 --> 01:00:53,334
You're an officer and a gentleman.

485
01:00:54,616 --> 01:00:56,094
Listen.

486
01:00:57,695 --> 01:00:59,890
That damned train again.

487
01:01:50,782 --> 01:01:56,380
"He breaketh the bow
and snappeth the spear in sunder!"

488
01:01:56,463 --> 01:01:59,376
"I will be exalted among the heathen. "

489
01:02:00,264 --> 01:02:02,539
"I will be exalted in the earth. "

490
01:02:03,744 --> 01:02:06,305
"The Lord of hosts is with us. "

491
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:10,622
I hope so. As I live
and die, I hope so.

492
01:02:27,828 --> 01:02:31,218
Company will fix bayonets!

493
01:02:42,269 --> 01:02:45,307
Attention!

494
01:02:48,390 --> 01:02:51,622
You slovenly soldier, Hitch.

495
01:05:38,574 --> 01:05:40,086
Load!

496
01:07:26,027 --> 01:07:28,417
North rampart, stand fast!

497
01:07:30,828 --> 01:07:34,902
South rampart,... at 100 yards!

498
01:07:36,709 --> 01:07:38,506
Volley fire!

499
01:07:39,509 --> 01:07:41,023
Present!

500
01:07:59,352 --> 01:08:01,183
Fire!

501
01:08:01,272 --> 01:08:03,264
Reload!

502
01:08:12,074 --> 01:08:13,553
Fire!

503
01:08:18,514 --> 01:08:23,350
Reload! Independent, fire at will!

504
01:08:24,115 --> 01:08:26,425
That's very nice of him.

505
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,315
- They're just asking for it.
- Keep firing, soldier.

506
01:08:53,399 --> 01:08:55,789
Mark your targets before you fire.

507
01:09:00,641 --> 01:09:02,677
Adendorff, what's wrong with them?

508
01:09:02,761 --> 01:09:07,471
- Why don't they fight?
- They're counting your guns.

509
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:11,679
See that old boy up on the hill?
He's counting your guns.

510
01:09:11,761 --> 01:09:15,721
Testing your firing power
with the lives of his warriors.

511
01:09:30,285 --> 01:09:32,276
Cease firing!

512
01:09:42,846 --> 01:09:44,484
- Well?
- They'll be back.

513
01:09:46,566 --> 01:09:48,558
Stand fast!

514
01:09:49,407 --> 01:09:52,444
60. We dropped at least 60,
wouldn't you say?

515
01:09:52,527 --> 01:09:53,756
That leaves only 3,940.

516
01:09:56,328 --> 01:10:00,640
"Rise up, my love,
my fair one, and come away. "

517
01:10:01,528 --> 01:10:05,363
"Behold, thou art fair, my love!"

518
01:10:06,049 --> 01:10:08,040
How long?

519
01:10:08,129 --> 01:10:13,488
10, 15 minutes. Maybe less.
As soon as they've regrouped.

520
01:10:13,570 --> 01:10:17,962
"Thy lips are like
a thread of scarlet,

521
01:10:18,051 --> 01:10:21,521
and thy speech is comely. "

522
01:10:22,452 --> 01:10:24,443
He can't be!

523
01:10:24,532 --> 01:10:28,127
He is. Drunk as a lord.

524
01:10:29,332 --> 01:10:32,881
- 15 minutes.
- If we're lucky.

525
01:10:35,733 --> 01:10:40,046
"Many waters cannot quench love,

526
01:10:40,134 --> 01:10:44,127
neither can the floods drown it. "

527
01:10:44,214 --> 01:10:47,366
Yes, sir, the gentleman has a bottle.

528
01:10:47,455 --> 01:10:52,245
Then get him out of here. Put him
on his cart. Tie him on if necessary.

529
01:10:52,335 --> 01:10:54,849
The sooner we get rid
of them the better.

530
01:10:59,016 --> 01:11:05,331
- They won't stand a chance with the Zulus.
- They're Witt's parishioners.

531
01:11:05,457 --> 01:11:09,167
But the woman, do you
want to see her killed?

532
01:11:09,258 --> 01:11:11,010
Do you, Bromhead?

533
01:11:11,098 --> 01:11:14,489
Because you will if we don't
get them out of here.

534
01:11:23,539 --> 01:11:25,895
Come along, sir.
There's a good gentleman.

535
01:11:33,101 --> 01:11:35,092
Alright, pick him up.

536
01:11:41,742 --> 01:11:45,894
"I have sinned against
heaven, and before thee. "

537
01:12:12,426 --> 01:12:15,543
"Peace be within thy walls... "

538
01:12:22,467 --> 01:12:25,904
Drive with the sun at your back.
You should make it safely.

539
01:12:29,309 --> 01:12:31,061
Leave me alone!

540
01:12:33,549 --> 01:12:35,779
Try to understand him, Miss Witt.

541
01:12:37,389 --> 01:12:39,027
Death awaits you!

542
01:12:39,109 --> 01:12:44,343
You have made a covenant with death
and with hell you are in agreement!

543
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:49,551
You're all going to die!
Don't you realise?

544
01:12:49,631 --> 01:12:52,099
Can't you see?

545
01:12:52,192 --> 01:12:55,582
You're all going to die!

546
01:13:02,592 --> 01:13:06,142
- Death awaits you all!
- He's right.

547
01:13:07,913 --> 01:13:09,791
Why is it us?

548
01:13:12,754 --> 01:13:16,668
Because we're here,
lad, and nobody else.

549
01:13:19,075 --> 01:13:21,067
Just us.

550
01:13:28,396 --> 01:13:31,786
Right, now get back to your posts.
At the double.

551
01:14:33,805 --> 01:14:36,764
Here they come again!

552
01:14:39,646 --> 01:14:41,125
Volley!

553
01:14:41,967 --> 01:14:43,957
Fire!

554
01:14:50,807 --> 01:14:54,164
- I can't see a bloody one now.
- They've gone to ground.

555
01:14:56,608 --> 01:14:58,599
Reload!

556
01:15:49,535 --> 01:15:51,333
There they go!

557
01:15:52,176 --> 01:15:55,293
Eyes front. Look to the front!

558
01:15:55,376 --> 01:15:57,368
What the devil's going on?

559
01:15:59,177 --> 01:16:01,371
Tell me what's happening.
I've got to know.

560
01:16:01,456 --> 01:16:05,370
They're on both sides! We haven't
enough men at the north wall.

561
01:16:05,457 --> 01:16:07,766
Can't you take some from the south?

562
01:16:07,857 --> 01:16:09,814
How will we hold that if we do?

563
01:16:09,898 --> 01:16:12,810
Adendorff, are they going
to hit us everywhere at once?

564
01:16:12,898 --> 01:16:15,697
I told you, remember.
The horns of the buffalo.

565
01:16:15,779 --> 01:16:18,168
The south could have been a feint.

566
01:16:18,259 --> 01:16:23,175
We can't man the whole perimeter.
We've got to outgun them somewhere.

567
01:16:29,420 --> 01:16:33,892
Alright, Bromhead, take men from
the south, one section in three.

568
01:16:35,061 --> 01:16:36,574
Reinforce the north wall.

569
01:16:37,101 --> 01:16:43,133
- But if they come from the south again?
- Get on with it. At the double.

570
01:16:43,703 --> 01:16:49,939
I want every other man from sections
1, 3, and 5 over at the north wall.

571
01:16:56,504 --> 01:16:58,096
First two.

572
01:16:59,624 --> 01:17:01,616
Follow me.

573
01:17:03,505 --> 01:17:05,496
Where would you like me?

574
01:17:06,706 --> 01:17:09,174
You pick your own ground.

575
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:11,655
It's your country, isn't it?

576
01:18:11,914 --> 01:18:14,303
Hey, who left the door open?

577
01:18:22,276 --> 01:18:24,073
Blazes! Where did they get those?

578
01:18:24,156 --> 01:18:26,624
Off the bodies of your
regiment at Isandhlwana.

579
01:18:26,716 --> 01:18:29,436
That's a bitter pill,
our own damn rifles!

580
01:18:41,958 --> 01:18:43,869
Keep your heads down.

581
01:18:49,079 --> 01:18:52,470
This is your section now.
Keep the heads of those marksmen down.

582
01:18:52,560 --> 01:18:56,190
- Can't see none of 'em, sir.
- Corporal, fire at the smoke.

583
01:18:56,281 --> 01:19:00,194
- Keep them pinned down, not us.
- Sir. Fire at the smoke.

584
01:19:36,846 --> 01:19:39,963
- Not the best of shots, are they?
- Get a platoon together.

585
01:19:40,046 --> 01:19:42,766
I'll need more than one
if I'm going after them.

586
01:19:42,847 --> 01:19:45,998
You're not. Get a platoon
of good bayonet men.

587
01:19:46,087 --> 01:19:50,525
Take head on anything that breaks through.
- It's still a holding action?

588
01:19:50,608 --> 01:19:56,240
Your job is to plug the gaps from the
inside. And get yourself a good sergeant.

589
01:20:30,093 --> 01:20:31,526
Hitch! Get down!

590
01:20:31,613 --> 01:20:34,207
How can I shoot them
if I can't see them?

591
01:20:38,374 --> 01:20:40,525
My leg! Corp!

592
01:21:06,498 --> 01:21:10,253
Can I undo my tunic
buttons now, can I, Corp?

593
01:21:24,340 --> 01:21:26,456
Stretcher bearers!

594
01:21:31,501 --> 01:21:33,060
Come on, attack, damn you!

595
01:21:40,502 --> 01:21:42,493
Here they come!

596
01:21:44,343 --> 01:21:46,652
North wall, volley fire! Present!

597
01:21:46,743 --> 01:21:48,654
At 100 yards!

598
01:21:50,464 --> 01:21:53,342
Fire! Reload!

599
01:21:53,424 --> 01:21:56,098
Independent, fire at will!

600
01:23:31,237 --> 01:23:32,716
- Bromhead!
- Follow me!

601
01:24:52,848 --> 01:24:55,124
Mr Chard, I'll get you help.

602
01:25:21,492 --> 01:25:24,451
Keep our squad on the wall, Sergeant.

603
01:25:30,214 --> 01:25:31,726
Chard! Are you alright?

604
01:25:33,173 --> 01:25:34,731
Take...

605
01:25:35,854 --> 01:25:37,572
command.

606
01:25:42,255 --> 01:25:44,246
You're the professional.

607
01:25:45,375 --> 01:25:47,765
Take command.

608
01:25:47,856 --> 01:25:50,973
Now, listen, old boy,
you're not badly hurt.

609
01:25:51,056 --> 01:25:55,369
We need you! Damn you,
we need you. Understand?

610
01:25:55,457 --> 01:25:57,253
Get him to Surgeon Reynolds.

611
01:25:57,336 --> 01:26:00,409
Take command. You want it, don't you?

612
01:26:22,780 --> 01:26:24,418
Scalpel.

613
01:26:30,021 --> 01:26:33,331
Orderly, damn it!
Will you keep the flies away!

614
01:26:34,342 --> 01:26:36,333
Fan it!

615
01:26:36,422 --> 01:26:40,052
Damn you, Chard!
Damn all you butchers!

616
01:26:52,424 --> 01:26:54,096
Why?

617
01:27:01,265 --> 01:27:03,416
It's alright, boy, you sleep.

618
01:27:03,506 --> 01:27:05,974
I'm damned if I can tell you why.

619
01:27:11,907 --> 01:27:16,935
Do you know this boy?
- Cole, Sir. He was a coiner.

620
01:27:18,587 --> 01:27:22,581
He's a dead paperhanger now.
Orderlies!

621
01:27:37,111 --> 01:27:39,102
Are you alright?

622
01:27:57,713 --> 01:28:03,152
- There they go, boys. After 'em!
- Stand fast! They're retiring, sir.

623
01:28:03,234 --> 01:28:06,307
North wall, hold your fire.

624
01:28:06,395 --> 01:28:08,464
Down!

625
01:28:12,555 --> 01:28:14,546
What is it? Another blasted trick?

626
01:28:14,635 --> 01:28:20,393
- They're forming up on the south plain.
- They're going to attack both walls at once.

627
01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:23,708
I doubt it, not unless
they have no other choice.

628
01:28:23,797 --> 01:28:28,587
The general couldn't use his rifles on
the hill for fear of hitting his own men.

629
01:28:28,677 --> 01:28:33,831
So he probes for weaknesses on the one
wall while he keeps the other pinned down.

630
01:28:45,759 --> 01:28:48,069
They're on the move, sir!

631
01:28:48,160 --> 01:28:53,918
North wall, keep those riflemen
pinned down. South wall, volley fire!

632
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:55,992
Present!

633
01:29:00,401 --> 01:29:02,392
Fire!

634
01:29:02,481 --> 01:29:03,961
Reload!

635
01:29:06,922 --> 01:29:09,675
- Hookie, do something!
- I'm excused duty.

636
01:29:09,763 --> 01:29:13,073
- I haven't excused you, have I?
- You want some help?

637
01:29:13,163 --> 01:29:15,154
Why didn't you say so?

638
01:29:32,245 --> 01:29:34,965
This rifle! Honestly,
I can't manage it.

639
01:29:35,046 --> 01:29:38,642
Now, now, you heard
what the officer said. Come on.

640
01:29:38,727 --> 01:29:43,084
But if it really came down to it,
sir, I couldn't really shoot anyone.

641
01:29:43,807 --> 01:29:46,402
Careful! Pop that chap, somebody!

642
01:29:50,608 --> 01:29:52,599
Good fellow. Good fellow.

643
01:29:52,688 --> 01:29:54,679
You see?

644
01:30:27,533 --> 01:30:29,524
You're doing fine.

645
01:30:29,613 --> 01:30:31,252
Where...

646
01:30:32,214 --> 01:30:34,330
You want to rest here a bit?

647
01:30:41,735 --> 01:30:43,726
Watch it!

648
01:30:48,856 --> 01:30:50,494
Can you move your leg?

649
01:30:50,576 --> 01:30:53,090
- If you want me to dance.
- I want you to crawl.

650
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:56,613
Come on, you slovenly soldier,
we've got work to do.

651
01:31:03,418 --> 01:31:05,649
It's alright, sir,
we'll do that for you.

652
01:31:05,739 --> 01:31:09,048
- I'm alright.
- You better get to the surgeon.

653
01:31:09,138 --> 01:31:13,212
- I'll try to get someone to help you.
- I can manage.

654
01:31:18,180 --> 01:31:20,171
Here.

655
01:31:32,662 --> 01:31:34,379
Hold them!

656
01:31:39,982 --> 01:31:42,622
Hey, Noel, Tommy, look!

657
01:31:46,944 --> 01:31:51,256
Bromhead, reorganise your
flying platoon with Sgt Windridge.

658
01:31:51,344 --> 01:31:53,700
But I... Yes, sir, of course.

659
01:31:56,825 --> 01:31:59,579
- Well done, Corporal. Stand by.
- Sir.

660
01:32:12,387 --> 01:32:14,139
Sir? Are you alright, sir?

661
01:32:19,908 --> 01:32:21,786
The men on the church roof,

662
01:32:21,869 --> 01:32:25,225
have them support your fire
against the hillside.

663
01:32:27,109 --> 01:32:32,024
Section on the roof, bring your rifles
about on the hillside. Fire at the smoke.

664
01:32:32,109 --> 01:32:37,025
The men on the hospital loopholes,
they've nothing to fire at.

665
01:32:37,110 --> 01:32:41,150
Bring them to the front windows
to support the north wall.

666
01:32:43,231 --> 01:32:46,668
- I want half your men now.
- An even number, sir?

667
01:32:46,872 --> 01:32:48,624
- Form two lines on the double.
- Sir!

668
01:33:01,754 --> 01:33:02,789
Company!

669
01:33:05,114 --> 01:33:07,106
Company! En garde!

670
01:33:18,716 --> 01:33:21,025
Fall back! Clear the line of fire!

671
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:26,471
Front rank! Fire!

672
01:33:26,557 --> 01:33:30,597
Rear rank! Fire! Advance!

673
01:34:12,163 --> 01:34:15,314
Independent, fire at will!

674
01:34:36,206 --> 01:34:37,275
Cease firing!

675
01:35:32,814 --> 01:35:34,691
Hey, Thomas. There's some water.

676
01:35:53,856 --> 01:35:57,611
- 470 Davies was hit, you know.
- No!

677
01:35:57,697 --> 01:35:59,688
Aye, in the throat.

678
01:36:01,658 --> 01:36:03,410
What a pity.

679
01:36:03,498 --> 01:36:06,296
The man is a great bass baritone.

680
01:36:07,179 --> 01:36:08,851
In the throat, is it?

681
01:36:10,659 --> 01:36:12,217
Hey, where are you going?

682
01:36:12,300 --> 01:36:16,657
- I'm going to see that calf, man.
- Come back! What are you doing?

683
01:36:19,900 --> 01:36:24,213
Mr Bourne, there should be 12 more
men working on this redoubt.

684
01:36:24,341 --> 01:36:26,172
They're very tired, sir.

685
01:36:27,421 --> 01:36:29,982
I don't give a damn.

686
01:36:30,062 --> 01:36:36,662
I want this nine foot high. Form
details to clear away the Zulu warriors.

687
01:36:36,743 --> 01:36:39,098
Rebuild the south ramparts.

688
01:36:39,183 --> 01:36:41,174
Keep them moving.

689
01:36:42,024 --> 01:36:43,662
- You understand?
- Yes, sir.

690
01:36:44,584 --> 01:36:46,574
Very good, sir.

691
01:36:52,865 --> 01:36:55,015
Alright, lads, keep it moving.

692
01:37:05,067 --> 01:37:08,264
We're next, boys.
This is the blind spot.

693
01:37:10,907 --> 01:37:15,423
Even if those flaming officers
ain't seen it, I bet the Zulus have.

694
01:37:16,628 --> 01:37:19,745
- Howarth, put your money up.
- Are you stupid?

695
01:37:19,828 --> 01:37:23,185
What bloody good will it do you
if you do win? We're all goners!

696
01:37:23,269 --> 01:37:26,386
Well, it don't matter if you lose!

697
01:37:34,951 --> 01:37:38,260
There's brandy in Reynolds'
medical cabinet. Borrow some.

698
01:37:38,350 --> 01:37:40,262
- It's locked up.
- Kick it down, then.

699
01:37:40,351 --> 01:37:43,502
Hey, that's company punishment.

700
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:47,543
On the right.

701
01:37:47,632 --> 01:37:49,702
Form close columns of platoons.

702
01:37:50,632 --> 01:37:54,069
- By the right!
- You lucky bastard!

703
01:38:10,235 --> 01:38:12,226
Oh dear.

704
01:38:13,075 --> 01:38:16,910
Well, your mum will need somebody
to milk her now, won't she?

705
01:38:36,038 --> 01:38:37,836
Stand to!

706
01:38:37,919 --> 01:38:40,228
Alright, alright, I can hear you.

707
01:40:36,575 --> 01:40:39,692
Out you get, Hookie,
you've done your bit.

708
01:40:53,057 --> 01:40:56,016
Quick! Thousands of 'em! 612!

709
01:41:07,458 --> 01:41:09,814
Knock a hole in that wall!

710
01:41:37,623 --> 01:41:39,898
Better get down now, sir.

711
01:41:46,904 --> 01:41:48,896
Get down now, sir!

712
01:41:56,105 --> 01:41:58,255
No! Jones, it's me!

713
01:41:58,345 --> 01:42:00,860
Come on, get through,
you bloody Englishman!

714
01:42:16,148 --> 01:42:19,505
Get out!

715
01:42:54,633 --> 01:42:56,305
Come on up!

716
01:43:11,316 --> 01:43:14,148
Get to Surgeon Reynolds.
Right, get on the wall.

717
01:43:29,798 --> 01:43:31,470
I know you!

718
01:43:32,559 --> 01:43:35,119
What about the money
you sent my old woman?

719
01:43:53,521 --> 01:43:55,558
That's it, Hook, my lad!

720
01:44:14,724 --> 01:44:17,158
Stay where you are, Maxfield!

721
01:44:22,765 --> 01:44:24,404
Get out!

722
01:44:27,606 --> 01:44:29,517
That's my boy, Hook!

723
01:44:29,606 --> 01:44:33,394
You're a soldier now!
I've made a soldier of you!

724
01:44:33,486 --> 01:44:35,238
Where's my bloody sergeant?

725
01:44:54,090 --> 01:44:55,728
Get out! Come on!

726
01:45:05,851 --> 01:45:07,921
Is everybody out? On the wall.

727
01:45:09,811 --> 01:45:13,202
Hookie? Where's Hookie? Come down!

728
01:45:35,175 --> 01:45:37,131
Hookie! That's a flogging offence!

729
01:45:41,616 --> 01:45:44,255
Get out, for God's sake, man!

730
01:45:55,177 --> 01:45:57,169
- Everybody out?
- Everybody that will get out.

731
01:46:00,978 --> 01:46:05,894
- Abandon the outside ramparts.
- Bugler! Retire to this wall!

732
01:47:20,149 --> 01:47:22,868
Colour Sergeant,
carry on building the inner redoubt.

733
01:47:22,949 --> 01:47:26,306
Alright, nobody told
you to stop working!

734
01:47:46,712 --> 01:47:48,988
Look at that.

735
01:47:50,033 --> 01:47:54,107
- Do you think he wanted it that way?
- Look at it burn!

736
01:48:02,594 --> 01:48:04,586
Any more in there?

737
01:48:07,755 --> 01:48:10,668
Then we'll have to take them
from the outside walls.

738
01:48:24,038 --> 01:48:26,631
- Are you awake, man?
- What is it?

739
01:48:27,357 --> 01:48:30,156
I didn't think it was going to die.

740
01:48:30,238 --> 01:48:34,232
- Can you see something?
- No, the calf, I'm talking about.

741
01:48:35,399 --> 01:48:37,390
There's sorry I am.

742
01:48:39,320 --> 01:48:41,356
Aye. Seems a pity, doesn't it?

743
01:48:46,601 --> 01:48:49,593
How many times have
they come since sunset?

744
01:48:49,681 --> 01:48:54,072
I don't know. Do you reckon
they'll come again?

745
01:48:57,962 --> 01:49:01,113
I think they've got more guts
than we have, boyo.

746
01:49:04,923 --> 01:49:06,481
Soldiers!

747
01:49:22,125 --> 01:49:24,593
Alright, back to your posts.

748
01:49:24,685 --> 01:49:26,438
You, hold there.

749
01:49:26,526 --> 01:49:28,517
Orderly, see to these men.

750
01:50:14,732 --> 01:50:17,566
Put a third of our men in the redoubt.

751
01:50:17,653 --> 01:50:19,848
Send the bugler to me.

752
01:50:21,653 --> 01:50:23,645
I was asleep, sir.

753
01:50:25,054 --> 01:50:27,045
You let me sleep?

754
01:50:27,974 --> 01:50:30,045
You shouldn't have done that.

755
01:50:36,815 --> 01:50:39,204
Is there any water?

756
01:50:39,295 --> 01:50:42,174
I sent what was left to Reynolds.

757
01:50:45,336 --> 01:50:47,851
It's fear dries the mouth, isn't it?

758
01:50:49,457 --> 01:50:51,607
When a man's as thirsty as this.

759
01:50:53,818 --> 01:50:56,286
I could have drunk a river.

760
01:51:01,338 --> 01:51:03,454
Thank you for what you said.

761
01:51:06,419 --> 01:51:09,377
Oh, you mean about our needing you?

762
01:51:11,780 --> 01:51:14,248
Yes. Don't bother, old boy, it's true.

763
01:51:19,221 --> 01:51:21,098
Come with me.

764
01:51:29,182 --> 01:51:31,821
Get in the redoubt, my lucky lads.

765
01:51:31,902 --> 01:51:33,894
Make a move.

766
01:51:34,943 --> 01:51:36,934
Come on.

767
01:52:16,789 --> 01:52:20,338
Alright, lads, take up your
positions on the firing step.

768
01:52:20,429 --> 01:52:22,226
Keep your heads down.

769
01:52:43,113 --> 01:52:45,501
- How old are you, boy?
- Sir?

770
01:52:46,992 --> 01:52:48,870
It doesn't matter.

771
01:52:48,953 --> 01:52:50,944
- You know what to sound?
- Yes, sir.

772
01:52:53,313 --> 01:52:55,305
Stay by me.

773
01:56:06,260 --> 01:56:09,536
Do you think the Welsh can't
do better than that, Owen?

774
01:56:09,620 --> 01:56:12,578
Well, they've got a very
good bass section, mind,

775
01:56:13,580 --> 01:56:16,539
but no top tenors, that's for sure.

776
01:56:42,664 --> 01:56:44,177
Sing!

777
01:56:47,425 --> 01:56:49,222
Come on, sing!

778
01:58:19,598 --> 01:58:21,588
At 100 yards!

779
01:58:23,037 --> 01:58:25,711
Volley fire! Present!

780
01:58:27,478 --> 01:58:30,915
Aim! Fire!

781
01:58:41,481 --> 01:58:43,676
Right, stand by. Lips dry?

782
01:58:45,761 --> 01:58:47,479
Prepare!

783
01:58:51,801 --> 01:58:52,712
Now!

784
01:58:54,362 --> 01:58:56,273
Spit, boy!

785
01:59:04,484 --> 01:59:06,042
Redoubt party!

786
01:59:07,044 --> 01:59:09,035
Fire!

787
01:59:13,484 --> 01:59:15,236
Volley by ranks!

788
01:59:15,324 --> 01:59:17,316
Front rank, fire!

789
01:59:17,405 --> 01:59:20,203
Second rank, fire!

790
01:59:20,285 --> 01:59:22,117
Third rank, fire!

791
01:59:47,089 --> 01:59:49,080
Cease firing!

792
02:00:34,135 --> 02:00:37,173
Three hours and they
haven't come again.

793
02:00:43,977 --> 02:00:48,289
The patrol's come back.
The Zulus have gone. All of them.

794
02:00:50,618 --> 02:00:52,609
It's a miracle!

795
02:00:53,098 --> 02:00:58,218
If it's a miracle, it's a short-chamber
Boxer-Henry. 45 calibre miracle.

796
02:00:58,298 --> 02:01:01,496
And a bayonet, sir,
with some guts behind it.

797
02:01:04,819 --> 02:01:07,129
- Fall them in. Call the roll.
- Sir.

798
02:01:08,580 --> 02:01:12,779
- Well, you did it.
- Me?

799
02:01:39,064 --> 02:01:41,704
- He's wounded, sir.
- He's dying, sir.

800
02:01:41,785 --> 02:01:43,264
- It's sad.

801
02:01:44,345 --> 02:01:46,337
Keep your voices down.

802
02:02:15,749 --> 02:02:18,741
- Who was left in here?
- I don't know.

803
02:02:19,949 --> 02:02:23,545
They had names and faces.
What do you mean, you don't know?

804
02:02:46,073 --> 02:02:51,467
- Well, you've fought your first action.
- Does everyone feel like this afterwards?

805
02:02:51,554 --> 02:02:53,590
How do you feel?

806
02:02:54,554 --> 02:02:56,546
Sick.

807
02:02:58,635 --> 02:03:01,673
Well, you have to
be alive to feel sick.

808
02:03:01,756 --> 02:03:04,145
You asked me, I told you.

809
02:03:06,475 --> 02:03:08,467
There's something else.

810
02:03:10,396 --> 02:03:12,387
I feel ashamed.

811
02:03:15,597 --> 02:03:19,830
Was that how it was for you?
The first time?

812
02:03:23,318 --> 02:03:27,437
You think I could stand this
butcher's yard more than once?

813
02:03:29,239 --> 02:03:31,231
I didn't know.

814
02:03:33,079 --> 02:03:35,149
I told you,

815
02:03:36,159 --> 02:03:38,674
I came up here to build a bridge.

816
02:03:53,923 --> 02:03:55,515
Excused duty.

817
02:03:58,522 --> 02:04:00,718
No comedians, please.

818
02:04:04,563 --> 02:04:08,193
Say "sir". Officer on parade.

819
02:04:18,406 --> 02:04:20,397
Hitch, I saw you.

820
02:04:20,486 --> 02:04:24,081
- You're alive.
- I am? Oh, thanks very much.

821
02:04:24,166 --> 02:04:27,397
- Answer the roll. Say "sir".
- Sir!

822
02:04:27,486 --> 02:04:31,446
Alright. Now get off into
the sickbay where you belong.

823
02:04:33,607 --> 02:04:36,168
- Yes, sir, me too.
- Stay where you are, Hook!

824
02:04:40,889 --> 02:04:45,246
Well, we haven't done too badly.

825
02:05:43,496 --> 02:05:46,295
Adendorff, why have they stopped?

826
02:05:50,698 --> 02:05:53,417
- I want an answer!
- Haven't you had enough?

827
02:05:53,498 --> 02:05:56,730
Both of you! My God,
can't you see it's all over!

828
02:05:56,819 --> 02:05:59,652
Your bloody egos
don't matter any more!

829
02:05:59,739 --> 02:06:02,095
We're dead!

830
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:05,851
What are you waiting for?

831
02:06:07,260 --> 02:06:09,569
Come on.

832
02:06:50,026 --> 02:06:52,017
Those bastards!

833
02:06:53,707 --> 02:06:56,301
They're taunting us!

834
02:07:02,107 --> 02:07:04,416
No. You couldn't be more wrong.

835
02:07:05,508 --> 02:07:07,897
They're... they're saluting you.

836
02:07:10,909 --> 02:07:13,582
They're saluting fellow braves.

837
02:07:16,069 --> 02:07:18,584
They're saluting you.

838
02:08:15,718 --> 02:08:18,356
Oh, my eye! Will you look!

839
02:08:54,923 --> 02:08:56,800
In the 100 years since
the Victoria Cross was created

840
02:08:56,883 --> 02:08:58,601
for extreme courage beyond that expected
