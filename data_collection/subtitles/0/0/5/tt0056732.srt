1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,997
THE EXTERMINATING ANGEL

2
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,830
Providence Street

3
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,038
- Where are you going?
- I'm going for a stroll

4
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:33,829
Now? We have 20 guests for dinner

5
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:38,278
I forgot that, but I promise
I'll be back soon

6
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:42,433
- You are going nowhere
- Please let me go

7
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,559
All right, but don't bother
coming back

8
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:15,470
Lucas has quit.
Has he been arguing with you?

9
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:19,349
No. He didn't tell us he was leaving

10
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,791
We got on well together.
He's a nice man

11
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,394
If he was not happy,
it's a good thing he's gone

12
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,994
Well, there are plenty more
like Lucas about

13
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,118
Maybe there's a woman involved

14
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,872
Camila, what shall we do?

15
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,272
Please yourself, but I simply
must go out

16
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,992
That's how I feel, but where
can we go at this hour?

17
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:00,958
And the weather's so awful

18
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:03,554
One of my friends will put us up

19
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:08,271
I'm taking a taxi, I could
drop you off

20
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:10,795
You'll wait for me

21
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,238
The caviar?

22
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,837
Madam wants the main dish
to be served first

23
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:32,993
- And I've got to do it
- Because you're a clown

24
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:25,390
Lucas isn't here. Your coats
will be taken upstairs

25
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:39,788
- Do you hear anything?
- They've gone upstairs

26
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,157
We shouldn't leave like this

27
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:46,676
You should have thought
of that before

28
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:48,592
Let's go

29
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,916
No, I've never tried it

30
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,198
Our youngest colonel, yet you
have no taste for heroism?

31
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,750
I dread the noise of guns, Blanca

32
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,876
What of your countrt?

33
00:05:33,040 --> 00:05:36,350
It's a network of rivers
flowing into the sea

34
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:39,956
- The sea is death
- Death for one's countrt

35
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,554
Alvaro, Edmundo wishes to speak

36
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:47,516
To the wonderful evening
given to us by Silvia...

37
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,309
...with her magnificent
virgin bride of Lammermoor

38
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:01,349
Bride, perhaps... but virgin?

39
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,513
- A title more appropriate to "Valkyrie"
- "Valkyrie"?

40
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:11,038
My name for Leticia.
She's ferocious and a virgin

41
00:06:11,200 --> 00:06:13,555
Are you sure she's virgin?

42
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:18,714
They say she preserves it -
a perversion, perhaps

43
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:24,269
To the wonderful evening
given to us by Silvia...

44
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:29,036
...with her magnificent
virgin bride of Lammermoor

45
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:46,952
I've taken the liberty
of varting the menu

46
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:52,672
<i>The hors-d'oeuvre will be a Maltese
dish, which is good for the appetite</i>

47
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,991
It's made of liver, honey, almonds
and a piquant sauce

48
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,551
<i>Delicious! I had it when
I conducted in Capri</i>

49
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,429
Right on cue, just as in the theatre

50
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:21,952
<i>Wonderful, Lucia!
That was really unexpected!</i>

51
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,317
<i>Lucia has a flair
for such chic surprises!</i>

52
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,436
I'm not in the least bit amused

53
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:03,909
I'm just in time.
Don't let him loose

54
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,755
Mr Russell doesn't like jokes,
put him in the garden

55
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:12,630
I think madam is wise.
There are other problems, too

56
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,916
- What's wrong?
- Odd things are happening

57
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,752
If madam will come with me...

58
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:21,038
- And the sheep, madam?
- Put them in the garden, too

59
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,873
- Where are you going?
- Madam...

60
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:33,989
Are you leaving, too, Pablo?

61
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,073
I must see my poor sister,
madam

62
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:40,993
Why? Is she ill?

63
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:43,230
She felt unwell this morning

64
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:48,428
<i>Ridiculous! This is an insult
to my guests</i>

65
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:52,149
Everything is ready to be served,
madam

66
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:55,710
<i>God, give me patience!
Have you been unhappy here?</i>

67
00:08:55,880 --> 00:09:01,113
On the contrart, a vert happy
five years, madam

68
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:04,477
- So?
- Forgive me

69
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,590
- And where are you going?
- I'm going with Pablo

70
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,153
- We'll be back in the morning
- Consider yourselves dismissed

71
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:18,756
I would like to be of service
to madam

72
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:21,354
Please forgive us.
Excuse me

73
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,276
No doubt they planned this.
Why?

74
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:31,149
Servants become more impertinent
evert day

75
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:35,279
Continue serving with the footmen.
I'm relying on you

76
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,950
- What about our things?
- We'll come back for them tomorrow

77
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,875
They won't let us in.
I'm taking my suitcase now

78
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,831
A passing Jew

79
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,719
No, it was "Valkyrie"

80
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,870
A fascinating woman

81
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:30,278
- What is your name?
- Beatriz. And yours?

82
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,668
Eduardo

83
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,638
- Age?
- Thirty

84
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:40,793
- Profession?
- Architect

85
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:46,836
- Single?
- Until Saturday, like you

86
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,276
Five more days

87
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:55,434
I ate with real appetite tonight,
doctor

88
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,670
Your treatment has transformed me

89
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:02,550
Not at all.
Your ailments are not serious

90
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,188
- Do you dance?
- I've never tried

91
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:08,511
A pity. I would love to be
in your arms

92
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:12,559
I'm flattered that my patient
is so pleased with me

93
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:21,795
- Transference
- I've long wanted to satisfy that desire

94
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,315
Did you bring your pills?

95
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,278
- What's the matter?
- It's nothing, doctor

96
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:31,399
With your ulcer you shouldn't
eat so much

97
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,634
May I present an old friend of mine?

98
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,711
- It's a pleasure to meet you
- Likewise

99
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,235
- Will you excuse me?
- Of course

100
00:11:44,040 --> 00:11:47,749
- Blanca is playing for us
- We'll be back in a minute

101
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:52,152
Why did she kiss you so passionately?

102
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:57,075
Poor Leonora, how is her cancer?
Any hope?

103
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:02,633
None. I give her three months
to total baldness

104
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:04,756
A good skull

105
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:15,432
<i>- Leandro!
- My dear Cristin</i>

106
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:19,479
It's so nice to see you.
I thought you were still in New York

107
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:24,953
- I turn up like a bad penny
- We must get together

108
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,113
We must arrange one of our
special entertainments

109
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,316
Careful, we're not alone

110
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,755
May I present Mr Russell?

111
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:37,833
Don't bother.
Continue to present each other

112
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:41,515
Besides, it's all Greek to me.
Excuse me

113
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:46,633
<i>- That Russell is eccentric
- He must be a man of letters. Too bad!</i>

114
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:49,872
Shall we go and listen to Blanca?

115
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:37,678
<i>Bravo! Well done!</i>

116
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:41,594
<i>- Magnificent!
- An exquisite performance</i>

117
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:45,673
How superb it would be
with a harpsichord

118
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,593
Now something by Scarlatti, I beg you

119
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,832
Excuse me, but it's late and I'm tired

120
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:57,120
But it's the most intimate,
agreeable moment of our evening

121
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:00,989
- You've been wonderful, Blanca
- Was it Paradisi?

122
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,878
<i>Exquisite!</i>

123
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:06,316
So, the great conductor is one of us

124
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:11,873
I'm happy to make your acquaintance...
so fraternally

125
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,315
- Which lodge?
- Dawn Twenty-one

126
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,913
Sublime column

127
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:20,471
<i>Maestro, what do you think
of the pizzicato we've just heard?</i>

128
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,279
Sonata, sir, sonata

129
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:27,672
May I introduce you? Seor Ugalde,
this is...

130
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,910
- Leandro Gmez
- Nice to meet you

131
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,355
- Will you stay long?
- Will you?

132
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,317
- You first
- No, you

133
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,472
- I live here
- Just as I thought

134
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,320
- Time for the coats
- Yes, sir

135
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:58,675
Please excuse him. He felt
rejuvenated this evening

136
00:14:58,840 --> 00:15:01,957
He drank a little, and he's tired

137
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:06,238
One cannot but admire his stamina
on the rostrum

138
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:09,437
How can he sustain
such demanding activity?

139
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:15,436
Well, after the concert
he even tried to...

140
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,434
I've nothing to complain about.
I even have to restrain him

141
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:23,275
<i>Let him sleep. He may trt again here!</i>

142
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,433
My goodness, I don't think
he would do that here

143
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,752
Of course not.
I expressed myself badly

144
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,232
She's a little tired. It's only
natural in her condition

145
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:39,358
Congratulations. Drowsiness
is a good sign

146
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:43,354
- Your fourth child?
- I've lost count

147
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:48,116
- Are you sure you're the father?
- You'd better ask her

148
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:50,350
Science will decide

149
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,836
I thought you'd gone

150
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:00,913
Ral is telling us about
the fauna of Romania

151
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,479
The climate, you see...

152
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:06,713
I really must go now.
Where is my shawl?

153
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,836
Just a second

154
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:33,359
They won't go. It's nearly four

155
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:38,469
They'll go soon. Then you
can slip up to my room

156
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:40,874
Your husband?

157
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:45,113
<i>If he finds you, I'll say I wanted
to show you my incunabula</i>

158
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,236
Good idea

159
00:16:58,280 --> 00:17:00,236
Thank you so much

160
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:09,671
It went well, in spite of...

161
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:14,038
It's late, and your lipstick
is fading

162
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:18,876
We must look after our friends.
They are feeling cooped-up

163
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:28,679
I enjoy the spontaneity
of this situation

164
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,796
If you care to spend
the night here...

165
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:34,236
...we will have rooms prepared
for you

166
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:38,473
I'm glad to see that the spirit
of improvisation still survives

167
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:44,636
You are the perfect host, but we
must not abuse your hospitality

168
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,836
I have a rehearsal tomorrow

169
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:51,232
And I have an appointment...
in only four hours time

170
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,799
Now they're turning out the lights

171
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,919
We must make a decision.
We must leave

172
00:18:11,080 --> 00:18:14,038
If the others are drunk or mad
they can stay

173
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:20,797
<i>This is outrageous!
If I weren't a guest here...</i>

174
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,428
...I'd teach that lout a lesson

175
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:29,835
These clothes may suit statues,
but not men at 5am

176
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:40,871
Isn't that going a bit too far?

177
00:18:41,040 --> 00:18:44,396
Don't forget that he's lived
in the United States

178
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:50,192
It's warm, and the body
is most exhausted at this hour

179
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:54,558
They will be ashamed when they
recall their conduct

180
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:58,872
Certainly, and I wish to spare them
embarrassment

181
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:05,229
Let us go to their level, to mitigate
their conduct a little

182
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,153
Please, Lucia, sit here

183
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,430
Our first night together

184
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:31,598
But why are we here?
Why haven't we left?

185
00:20:34,560 --> 00:20:36,312
Because evertone decided to stay

186
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,311
Is that normal?

187
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:47,439
Life is amusing... and strange

188
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:55,554
I can hardly keep awake

189
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:59,076
Come... Let's sleep

190
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:35,391
- Did you sleep well?
- I didn't wake once

191
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:41,476
For me it was worse than
the Nice Express derailment

192
00:22:41,640 --> 00:22:45,269
<i>You were in a derailment?
Fascinating!</i>

193
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,590
<i>You should see yourself!</i>

194
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:52,436
I'm bewildered. What's going on?

195
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:57,672
How could this happen to us?
It's a bit much

196
00:22:57,840 --> 00:23:03,392
We must offer them breakfast,
then they'll go home

197
00:23:03,560 --> 00:23:07,235
I hope so. I'm relying
on their discretion

198
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:09,868
I was quite shocked

199
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:14,716
A third-class carriage was squashed
like a concertina

200
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:17,872
<i>And inside, what carnage!</i>

201
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:21,077
The sight didn't upset me.
I must be insensitive

202
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:22,593
I'm hungrt

203
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,912
Yet you fainted at the bier
of Prince Lourcat

204
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,354
<i>No comparison!</i>

205
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:34,117
How could one be insensitive
to his grandeur in death?

206
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:36,794
He had such a noble profile

207
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,678
Don't they eat breakfast here?

208
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:43,834
I think the lower orders are
insensitive to suffering

209
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,356
Have you ever seen a wounded bull?
It's impassive

210
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:54,278
I'm going to tidy myself. We look
horrible, but it's amusing

211
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,152
Did you sleep well?

212
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,997
I must look awful. Why stare at me,
dear sister?

213
00:24:03,160 --> 00:24:07,597
You are more interesting than ever -
unkemptness becomes you

214
00:24:21,680 --> 00:24:24,672
I must look awful.
Why are you staring at me?

215
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:29,311
You are more interesting than ever -
unkemptness becomes you

216
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,436
<i>What sharp ears!</i>

217
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:48,552
After a bad night,
he lost consciousness at dawn

218
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:52,315
You should have told me.
He must be put to bed

219
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:56,109
It's better not move him. We'll do
what we can for him here

220
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:59,989
- Keep him warm
- I thought he was looking odd at dinner

221
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:03,755
It may not be anything serious,
it's not the first time

222
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:08,391
- How is he?
- Almost totally bald

223
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:13,076
- I don't understand
- He only has a few hours to live

224
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:17,438
And your prognoses are never wrong

225
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:21,229
- I don't feel vert well, either
- It's nothing

226
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,952
Julio, do your best to provide
breakfast for our guests

227
00:25:32,120 --> 00:25:35,192
It's vert early,
the tradesmen haven't delivered yet

228
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:38,113
- Not even the milkman?
- Not even him. It's really odd

229
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:42,671
Bring the cold meat from dinner
and some hot coffee

230
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,751
Lucia, where could we freshen up
a little?

231
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:56,277
I should have attended to that
earlier. Come to my room

232
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:04,916
I bet they won't go

233
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,070
You see? What do you make
of this situation?

234
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,189
I don't know. It's uncommon,
or perhaps only too common

235
00:26:15,360 --> 00:26:18,670
No one seems to behave logically

236
00:26:18,840 --> 00:26:21,400
Why didn't you and your fiance
leave?

237
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:25,712
I don't know... like evertone else...
and you?

238
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,876
I don't know

239
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:33,873
That's what bothers me

240
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:39,512
Not one of us has made
the slightest effort to go home

241
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:44,919
Why? Was it natural for us
to spend the night here...

242
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:48,277
...against the elementart rules
of etiquette?

243
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,512
Have we become a gypsy encampment?

244
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:55,150
I think it's vert original.
I love things out of the ordinart

245
00:26:55,320 --> 00:27:00,838
I don't like it. But I said nothing,
out of politeness

246
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:04,959
Come, gentlemen, let's not exaggerate

247
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:10,831
We were enchanted by the music,
the conversation...

248
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:14,436
It's not a cause for surprise.
My feet are swollen

249
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:19,632
May I ask our charming Lucia...

250
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:24,316
...why serve breakfast here,
instead of in the dining room?

251
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,678
Well, doctor, since we're all here
I thought...

252
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:33,470
The doctor loves to play
Sherlock Holmes, doesn't he?

253
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,953
My husband and children must be
worried. I'm going home

254
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:45,070
We'll go with you.
This is all so absurd

255
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,839
- Are you coming, Rita?
- Isn't it rather early to go out?

256
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:58,470
We must see our children off
to school

257
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:03,668
My children study at home
with their tutor, Abb Samson

258
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:08,755
I think he is something of a saint.
Even my husband says...

259
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:10,672
Isn't it true, Cristin?

260
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:15,914
Madam, this is no time to prattle
about priests... Let's go

261
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:19,436
Excuse me

262
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,679
What have we got to lose
by drinking coffee?

263
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:28,831
I can't smoke on an empty stomach

264
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:32,754
I'd like some, too.
Will you join us, Blanca?

265
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:41,478
This is excessive

266
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:44,359
I find this atmosphere
almost hysterical

267
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:48,877
It's not the first time that
I've breakfasted at a party

268
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,271
Lucia, I'm afraid there are
no sugar spoons

269
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:59,159
I'm sorrt, the butler has no help

270
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:01,993
- Julio, the sugar spoons
- Yes, madam

271
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,756
May I get you something, gentlemen?
Some coffee?

272
00:29:12,920 --> 00:29:16,629
No, Julio. Just do as you were told

273
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:20,952
I think I should attend until
breakfast is completed

274
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:24,032
Didn't you hear me ask you
to fetch sugar spoons?

275
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,910
- I merely thought...
- Do as I asked

276
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:41,279
What's the matter?
Do you feel unwell?

277
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:49,671
Blanca, what's wrong? Can I help you?

278
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,232
What's your opinion of all this?

279
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:04,192
The butler's strange disobedience
confirms my observations

280
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:10,230
No matter how we trt,
we cannot leave this room

281
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:12,960
What's going on?

282
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,715
<i>A man is vert ill!</i>

283
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:19,959
- How is he, doctor?
- Bluntly, he is in a coma

284
00:31:20,120 --> 00:31:23,795
If only I had some heart stimulants

285
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:32,439
Cristin, we need to make an effort
and put and end to this apathy

286
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:34,750
We must get Mr Russell out of here

287
00:31:34,920 --> 00:31:37,878
He urgently needs proper
medical facilities

288
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:43,475
The doctor is right.
We must make an effort

289
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,596
Who will dare to take him?

290
00:31:45,760 --> 00:31:50,072
Why don't you do it? You know
we'll all follow you

291
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,196
It's useless

292
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,877
We're lost. Why did you
bring me here, dear sister?

293
00:31:59,040 --> 00:32:03,192
Don't be cruel. It was you
who made me come here

294
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:05,316
Calm down...

295
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,160
There's no water

296
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:36,598
Isn't there any coffee left?
I'm dying of thirst

297
00:32:36,760 --> 00:32:40,594
Madam must excuse me,
but there's not a drop left

298
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:46,039
This can't be bad. A squeeze
of lemon will improve the taste

299
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:49,158
Thank you, Eduardo,
but I'd rather wait

300
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:56,558
I don't understand,
there must be a solution

301
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:58,995
Look at me.
We haven't gone mad, have we?

302
00:32:59,160 --> 00:33:03,597
Evertone's forgotten us. We've been
here for 24 hours. We're lost

303
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:07,230
That's what worries me most

304
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,868
What's the matter?
Why don't people come...

305
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:13,555
Unless evertone's dead
and we're the only survivors

306
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:18,350
- Why don't they come for us?
- Calm down

307
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,753
<i>Shut up!</i>

308
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:29,639
- I'm breaking the window
- Use the door

309
00:33:29,800 --> 00:33:32,997
There's a connection between this
and the servants leaving

310
00:33:33,160 --> 00:33:35,310
Gentlemen, please

311
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,190
Let's not be alarmist. The servants
must have had their reasons

312
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:44,831
Like rats when they leave
a sinking ship

313
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:49,312
May I just say...
I think they left for no reason

314
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:52,677
They were all happy until
shortly before you arrived

315
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,071
In short, there's no explanation.
It's extraordinart

316
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:00,358
We must keep calm, there's
nothing worse than panic

317
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:03,830
A situation like this
can't last forever

318
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:08,516
We're not spellbound, this isn't
a sorcerer's castle

319
00:34:08,680 --> 00:34:13,515
We will only overcome our plight
by cold analysis

320
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:16,148
I propose...

321
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:20,518
...that we should all concentrate,
make a supreme effort...

322
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:25,356
...be determined to get out of here,
to succeed...

323
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,311
Shut up, Nobile.
You're responsible for all this

324
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,153
We're all victims of a joke
that's in vert bad taste

325
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,359
I, my dear friend? Because
I invited you to dinner?

326
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:41,432
<i>- Because I opened my door?
- Exactly!</i>

327
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:46,037
You invited each of us
to dine here

328
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:50,352
"Would you do me the honour... "
et cetera

329
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:54,718
<i>We'd rather have slept at home,
or in a brothel. Anywhere!</i>

330
00:34:54,880 --> 00:34:58,589
Why did you extend
that strange invitation?

331
00:34:58,760 --> 00:35:02,958
Strange? But you were all delighted

332
00:35:03,120 --> 00:35:06,476
You yourself said
how happy you were

333
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:13,512
<i>Then I correct myself. One person
caused this degradation - you!</i>

334
00:35:13,680 --> 00:35:17,878
Me? You've lost your wits

335
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:20,554
Edmundo is right.
You're nothing but a fool

336
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,676
If you weren't a lady...

337
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,432
The water didn't seem to harm
the butler

338
00:35:32,600 --> 00:35:35,751
- I've got a headache
- No, Blanca, don't

339
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:48,277
Can't these men do anything?
They bicker like tarts

340
00:35:48,440 --> 00:35:53,355
Silvia, find a way for us
to get out of this hole

341
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:57,957
Don't be offended. He's more
sensitive than a young girl

342
00:35:58,120 --> 00:36:02,398
I'm sure this situation upsets him
more than it does us

343
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,790
<i>Don't make me worse!</i>

344
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:09,511
I don't want to hear anyone.
I want to be alone

345
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:23,835
I'm content. I won't see
the extermination

346
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:32,432
I wouldn't mind dying, but not
among people, like this

347
00:36:32,600 --> 00:36:35,160
I want the chance to be alone
with you

348
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:38,630
What hope have we got to be alone?

349
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:42,998
There is a way we can isolate
ourselves from the others

350
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:45,674
I don't see how

351
00:36:45,840 --> 00:36:50,789
I'll tell you when they're asleep,
if they ever decide to sleep

352
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:14,955
I lifted the lid and saw a precipice
and a raging torrent

353
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,430
As I sat down an eagle flew by
below me

354
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:22,798
The wind blew dead leaves
in my face

355
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,916
I'm cold

356
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:25,635
<i>Consumatum est</i>

357
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:30,635
<i>Just what we need! It would be better
if we evaporated when we died</i>

358
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:33,439
This corpse will demoralise them

359
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:38,720
Why didn't the old man die?
What's one conductor, more or less?

360
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:41,599
What shall we do?

361
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:21,116
- Were you seen?
- I don't know. I don't care

362
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:02,595
- Here it flows into the sea
- I can't reach

363
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,716
Keep descending

364
00:40:06,040 --> 00:40:10,113
Already the horrible, fixed grin

365
00:40:10,280 --> 00:40:12,475
My love

366
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:16,918
<i>My death.
Oh, my enclosure!</i>

367
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:22,875
Still nothing

368
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:26,032
- What do you suggest?
- This can't go on forever

369
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:31,399
Three days ago the mayor
tried to establish contact

370
00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:37,590
He wanted to give them instructions
by loudspeaker, if any are still alive

371
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:40,479
But I made him see the absurdity
of the idea

372
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,995
It strikes me as a good idea

373
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:50,639
But there's a simpler way. Why not
enter the house? No one's done that

374
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:56,272
Yesterday we ordered a brigade
of sappers to enter

375
00:41:56,440 --> 00:42:01,275
At nightfall they returned
to the barracks defeated

376
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:06,594
- Did they trt to enter?
- No, that's the worst of it

377
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:17,517
<i>- Let us go in! We're not animals
- Clear off!</i>

378
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,318
Why is it taking so long?
It's easy

379
00:42:43,480 --> 00:42:45,436
What's wrong?

380
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:48,994
- Me first. I'm feverish
- Me, too

381
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,116
Wait your turn

382
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:57,193
<i>You stepped on my foot!
Must you wear shoes?</i>

383
00:42:57,360 --> 00:42:59,555
Why is it taking so long?

384
00:42:59,720 --> 00:43:02,598
Maybe the water has been cut off

385
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:09,720
You could help them

386
00:43:09,880 --> 00:43:11,950
Excuse me

387
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:34,473
<i>Move away! Women first!</i>

388
00:43:40,320 --> 00:43:45,917
Get in line. Drink only
one glassful now

389
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:49,755
It will be dangerous to drink
too much at first

390
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:51,876
Drink in moderation

391
00:43:53,280 --> 00:43:57,432
<i>- Women first! Didn't you hear?
- Here, drink up</i>

392
00:43:57,600 --> 00:44:00,239
<i>I won't let you brutalise my brother!</i>

393
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:06,960
How nice and fresh

394
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:22,309
Hungrt... I'm hungrt

395
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,792
<i>Don't eat! Don't leave me alone!</i>

396
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:44,275
He's gone two days without speaking.
He's oblivious to evertone, even me

397
00:44:44,440 --> 00:44:46,271
And you say it isn't serious?

398
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:49,352
It isn't. He's suffering no more
than we are

399
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:53,149
He may feel the effects more
because of his age

400
00:44:53,320 --> 00:44:57,074
My hands are like dead twigs

401
00:44:57,240 --> 00:45:00,550
We might be better off without water

402
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,429
We'll only prolong our agony
by drinking it

403
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:12,233
- What are you eating?
- Paper. It helps to stave off hunger

404
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,598
- It's nauseating
- The taste isn't disagreeable

405
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:22,995
We used to eat it at school.
The lessons bored us

406
00:45:23,160 --> 00:45:26,470
My teachers were Jesuits,
good people

407
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,677
We were bored, like most children

408
00:45:29,840 --> 00:45:34,868
I know that paper is made
from softwood trees

409
00:45:35,040 --> 00:45:40,194
It can't harm you.
Would you care to trt it?

410
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:44,876
- Julio, come here
- Excuse me

411
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:55,670
<i>- Put this cloth around it
- Don't go! Don't leave me alone!</i>

412
00:45:55,840 --> 00:46:01,915
<i>Prince! Save me! Our pact!</i>

413
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:41,799
<i>I can't stand it anymore!</i>

414
00:46:41,960 --> 00:46:47,273
<i>I can't bear the way that harpy
combs her hair! I hate her!</i>

415
00:46:47,440 --> 00:46:51,194
<i>Better hunger and thirst than her!</i>

416
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,318
Why not comb it properly?

417
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:06,349
<i>Like that, you see!
Comb it right through!</i>

418
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:10,439
We are fed up with your odd habits

419
00:47:12,840 --> 00:47:15,718
Sorrt to bother your, Beatriz

420
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:21,398
Have you seen a silver box
containing pills?

421
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:26,918
A silver box? No, I'm sorrt

422
00:47:27,080 --> 00:47:32,632
They're my husband's pills. We used
to take great care of them but...

423
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,155
...now we're all feeling a bit...

424
00:47:35,320 --> 00:47:38,039
I'll look for them

425
00:47:43,920 --> 00:47:45,876
I'm hungrt

426
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:51,714
By any chance, is there
a lump of sugar?

427
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:56,874
I'm sorrt, madam, but there's
been nothing for two days

428
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:09,316
Are you feeling better? Someone
will find the box, you'll see

429
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:14,156
Doubtless someone has it,
but wants to see me suffer

430
00:48:14,320 --> 00:48:16,436
Don't say that

431
00:48:16,600 --> 00:48:20,957
You know, I wonder...

432
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:24,795
I wonder what they're doing.
I think of them all the time

433
00:48:24,960 --> 00:48:29,590
I never forget them, either.
Our poor children

434
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:33,070
My only consolation is that
the Abb will care for them

435
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:38,109
<i>The Abb! I'm worried that they're
at the mercy of that hypocrite</i>

436
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:41,397
- That's unjust
- Admit he chases after you

437
00:48:41,560 --> 00:48:47,430
<i>- I won't say more
- Go on, say more!</i>

438
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,875
Are you interested?

439
00:48:50,040 --> 00:48:54,556
You and your marital problems
mean nothing to me

440
00:48:55,880 --> 00:49:00,829
<i>You're insolent! I thought so
as soon as I saw you!</i>

441
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:04,993
I don't care. I've nothing
but contempt for you

442
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:11,838
Gentlemen, we are all
in the same boat

443
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,753
We'll all gain by treating
each other considerately

444
00:49:14,920 --> 00:49:18,230
- You'd better keep quiet
- That's right

445
00:49:18,400 --> 00:49:22,109
It's cynical to give advice
to your victims

446
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:27,434
My victims? What do you mean?

447
00:49:27,600 --> 00:49:29,830
I'd be relieved to hear
of some good reason...

448
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:31,911
I'm tired of explaining

449
00:49:32,080 --> 00:49:37,279
Come with me, don't say anymore.
Don't make them more irritable

450
00:49:42,560 --> 00:49:44,471
Sit down

451
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:49,558
Sit down with me, please

452
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:58,393
My friend, I'd give my life
to remedy this situation

453
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:05,590
I am appalled by suffering. I've
always tried to help the needy

454
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:07,955
How could they possibly believe
that I...

455
00:50:08,120 --> 00:50:11,271
Calm down

456
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:16,150
Alvaro, I'm so hungrt

457
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:19,198
Think of a way to get us out

458
00:50:19,360 --> 00:50:22,830
Only a miracle can free us

459
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:26,310
Why don't we all pray together?

460
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:29,517
We have made a solemn vow

461
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:35,630
<i>If Divine Providence frees us
we will offer a Te Deum</i>

462
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:42,789
<i>That frightful smell. It's unbearable!</i>

463
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,394
We're trting to contain it

464
00:50:52,640 --> 00:50:55,712
<i>Don't go! Don't leave me alone!</i>

465
00:51:13,600 --> 00:51:17,957
I'm so cold

466
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,151
I'm so cold

467
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:52,159
Blanca, remember what I told you
about your hair

468
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:54,276
Doctor?

469
00:51:56,480 --> 00:52:00,837
What can we do? She's suffering
so much, poor thing

470
00:52:08,600 --> 00:52:12,878
I can't stand it.
Why don't you kill me and end it all?

471
00:52:13,040 --> 00:52:17,716
Don't be silly. You had a good night

472
00:52:17,880 --> 00:52:22,078
We need analgesics as much
as we need food

473
00:52:22,240 --> 00:52:24,629
We haven't even an aspirin

474
00:52:24,800 --> 00:52:28,509
Don't leave me, doctor

475
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:31,638
I feel better when you're near

476
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:39,270
If we ever get out of this trap
I'll go to Lourdes

477
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:44,275
- Promise that you will come with me
- I promise

478
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:49,391
We'll humble ourselves
at the Virgin's feet...

479
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,235
...for only she can get us out of here

480
00:52:53,400 --> 00:52:57,154
Don't talk so much. It won't help
if you get excited

481
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:01,035
When we are at Lourdes...

482
00:53:01,200 --> 00:53:05,432
...you must buy me a washable
rubber Virgin

483
00:53:05,600 --> 00:53:07,875
You will, won't you?

484
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:43,270
Are these yours?

485
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,671
We call this room
"The Paradise of Thebes"

486
00:53:46,840 --> 00:53:52,073
A few friends gather here
to pass unforgettable hours

487
00:53:52,240 --> 00:53:54,674
Why didn't you show me before?

488
00:53:54,840 --> 00:53:59,709
In these circumstances, just imagine
if the others knew

489
00:53:59,880 --> 00:54:04,112
What was for pleasure
can now relieve pain

490
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,555
Laudanum, codeine and morphine

491
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,836
Morphine? Where?

492
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:24,673
- What is it?
- It's none of your business

493
00:54:24,840 --> 00:54:28,879
What has he got hidden there?

494
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:31,998
You'll sample it
when evertone is asleep

495
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:39,274
- I'm hungrt
- Silence

496
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:43,319
This is too much,
show some respect

497
00:54:49,120 --> 00:54:52,157
<i>- You smell like a hyena!
- What?</i>

498
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,595
<i>Like a hyena, madam!</i>

499
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:58,309
How dare you? Why insult me?

500
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:02,837
Shame on you for mentioning what
we have the dignity to ignore

501
00:55:03,000 --> 00:55:08,199
<i>It's the truth. She stinks,
like you, I, and evertone!</i>

502
00:55:08,360 --> 00:55:12,399
We live in a pigsty, like real pigs

503
00:55:12,560 --> 00:55:16,838
<i>You all disgust me. I hate you!</i>

504
00:55:21,280 --> 00:55:23,840
Take no notice, he's hypersensitive

505
00:55:28,960 --> 00:55:31,838
This will end badly, my dear

506
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:38,633
What I've always hated most -
coarseness, violence and filth

507
00:55:38,800 --> 00:55:43,032
They're now our inseparable
companions

508
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:47,478
Death is preferable
to this abject promiscuity

509
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:54,431
Lord Elohim, be with me

510
00:55:54,520 --> 00:55:59,878
The empire of witchcraft
is assembled here

511
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:05,949
Before I die, divine Lord...

512
00:56:06,120 --> 00:56:09,874
<i>...come! come! come!</i>

513
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:02,392
What have you done?
Have you lost your mind?

514
00:58:02,560 --> 00:58:05,677
<i>- Tie her hands up
- Take her away at once!</i>

515
00:58:05,840 --> 00:58:07,592
Call an ambulance

516
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:12,072
She's feverish. Put cold compresses
on her forehead

517
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:18,793
Don't crt, it's over. They'll take turns
to ensure nothing happens to you

518
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:32,629
- It's nauseating
- But it will kill the pain

519
00:58:56,160 --> 00:59:00,153
- What day is it?
- What?

520
00:59:00,320 --> 00:59:04,916
We've been here over a month,
haven't we?

521
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:10,234
Not yet. We'd have died of hunger
before now

522
00:59:10,400 --> 00:59:13,551
I feel we've always been here

523
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:16,154
I feel the same way

524
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:18,390
And we'll always be here

525
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,158
Unless...

526
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:30,872
Unless we escape together,
lose ourselves in the shadows

527
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:35,396
You don't answer

528
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:39,553
Where you go, I'll follow

529
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:01,718
- Look, it's just what we thought
- Yes

530
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,676
What's that?

531
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,356
<i>- What's the problem now?
- Be quiet!</i>

532
01:01:01,520 --> 01:01:03,033
Who stepped on my hand?

533
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,317
- What's the matter?
- I may have dreamt it

534
01:01:06,480 --> 01:01:08,835
<i>I'm not blind, sir!</i>

535
01:01:09,000 --> 01:01:12,629
<i>- What are you talking about?
- You behave like an incubus!</i>

536
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,360
Please, don't be ridiculous

537
01:01:15,520 --> 01:01:17,078
<i>Watch your tongue!</i>

538
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:20,038
- Calm down, gentlemen
- What's the matter?

539
01:01:20,200 --> 01:01:22,873
<i>The colonel took advantage
of the dark, like a thief!</i>

540
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:27,192
<i>You swine! Enough of this!
I challenge you to a duel!</i>

541
01:01:27,360 --> 01:01:30,830
<i>- I accept!
- A madhouse! One can't even sleep</i>

542
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:34,879
Nobile's at the centre of it all,
it's another of his schemes

543
01:01:35,040 --> 01:01:38,589
Don't you see
he's got an upset stomach?

544
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,515
This is madness. Calm down
and talk reasonably

545
01:01:43,680 --> 01:01:47,434
<i>Anything but physical violence!
It's not like us!</i>

546
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,990
Remember your upbringing,
remember who you are

547
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:54,914
I'd like to know if Nobile
provoked this

548
01:01:55,080 --> 01:01:58,277
We'll show him he can't play with us

549
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:01,079
I prefer not to answer, gentlemen

550
01:02:01,240 --> 01:02:03,310
There's a limit to our patience

551
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,789
Rita, trt to pacify him

552
01:02:05,960 --> 01:02:08,713
I'll never forget how
you've ridiculed me

553
01:02:08,880 --> 01:02:13,317
<i>- I'd rather have food than fighting
- Leave me alone!</i>

554
01:02:13,480 --> 01:02:15,232
How could you?

555
01:02:15,400 --> 01:02:19,109
Even the strongest
are losing their heads

556
01:02:19,280 --> 01:02:21,396
Have pity on me

557
01:02:21,560 --> 01:02:27,396
Cristin, please,
evert problem has a solution

558
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:31,155
I beg your pardon,
yours and evertone's

559
01:02:31,320 --> 01:02:35,199
I was out of my mind.
I was not myself

560
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:39,990
Please forgive me, madam

561
01:02:41,080 --> 01:02:46,029
May I make a suggestion which
I hope you will approve of?

562
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:50,671
To avoid lamentable brushes
in future...

563
01:02:50,840 --> 01:02:55,755
...ladies should sleep on one side
of the room, men on the other

564
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,229
<i>Remember you are speaking
to gentlemen!</i>

565
01:02:58,400 --> 01:03:02,473
He's a degenerate. He enjoys
insulting us

566
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:06,030
- Edmundo is right
- I just thought...

567
01:03:06,200 --> 01:03:10,352
Don't trt anymore,
can't you see that...?

568
01:04:10,200 --> 01:04:11,553
Thank you

569
01:04:11,720 --> 01:04:16,953
Remember now, behave yourselves.
Let's go

570
01:04:19,720 --> 01:04:22,234
- Where are you going?
- They're Ugalde's children

571
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:26,359
We're going to look at the house,
their parents are inside

572
01:04:26,520 --> 01:04:29,273
- Go ahead
- Thank you

573
01:04:36,320 --> 01:04:43,032
I'm sure I can go in and talk to them,
if they're still alive

574
01:04:43,200 --> 01:04:47,159
- Are you sure?
- I'll show you

575
01:04:48,920 --> 01:04:54,517
<i>Won't you let me? Then I'll tell
the Press!</i>

576
01:04:54,680 --> 01:05:00,312
<i>I need to be listened to,
I'm sure I can solve this business!</i>

577
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,436
Another maniac

578
01:05:07,840 --> 01:05:09,990
Go on, Johnny, don't stop

579
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:13,357
- Why have you stopped?
- Go on, Johnny?

580
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:17,399
<i>- He must not stop
- Keep going, child!</i>

581
01:05:20,280 --> 01:05:23,272
<i>Why run back?
You can't trust children!</i>

582
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:27,638
<i>- Come on, trt again!
- No, let's go</i>

583
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:15,989
So as not to fall into total apathy...

584
01:06:16,160 --> 01:06:20,199
...we must keep the place
clean and tidy

585
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:24,517
We'll organise cleaning teams

586
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:28,597
How are you?

587
01:06:28,760 --> 01:06:33,550
- All right, except for my head
- You poor thing

588
01:06:33,720 --> 01:06:37,838
If it weren't for him and Leticia,
they'd act like savages

589
01:06:38,000 --> 01:06:41,709
I'll never forget their defence of you

590
01:06:49,560 --> 01:06:54,350
I had a presentiment before going
to the opera that night

591
01:06:54,520 --> 01:07:00,709
I heard a voice insisting:
"Take the keys, take the keys"

592
01:07:00,880 --> 01:07:02,677
The keys?

593
01:07:02,840 --> 01:07:08,836
In the cabala, a key is anything
which opens the doors of the unknown

594
01:07:10,120 --> 01:07:15,114
Now, Blanca, hold that firmly.
Like this

595
01:07:17,000 --> 01:07:22,791
And you, Silvia, the other one,
like this

596
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:46,756
<i>Victim!</i>

597
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:14,112
I can't feel anything,
we need innocent blood

598
01:08:14,280 --> 01:08:16,919
We must await the sacrifice
of the last sheep

599
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:34,551
<i>- What's the matter?
- Look!</i>

600
01:08:36,800 --> 01:08:38,756
In the cupboard...

601
01:09:00,160 --> 01:09:02,879
Listen evertone...

602
01:09:06,200 --> 01:09:09,590
- What's the matter?
- It's over

603
01:09:09,760 --> 01:09:15,995
<i>Eduardo, Beatriz...
Doctor, in there!</i>

604
01:09:22,120 --> 01:09:24,190
What's going on?

605
01:09:30,760 --> 01:09:35,356
Leandro, Colonel, help me.
Keep evertbody away

606
01:09:35,520 --> 01:09:38,432
Let me see, Alvaro

607
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:41,592
- How did they do it?
- It doesn't matter. Back off

608
01:09:41,760 --> 01:09:44,115
They slit their wrists

609
01:10:19,640 --> 01:10:21,835
What's so funny?

610
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:23,956
I was thinking...

611
01:10:25,800 --> 01:10:30,271
...what if I pushed you into
the other room?

612
01:10:30,440 --> 01:10:33,159
I'd kill you

613
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,597
What does that mean?

614
01:10:48,760 --> 01:10:51,274
They've lost whatever reason
they had

615
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:57,231
It's a Masonic call for help.
They must go to each other's aid

616
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:59,595
But here... unless, of course,
the bear...

617
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:14,158
Cristin, the time has come
to speak the unutterable word

618
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:23,353
C... H... I... H... H... O... H

619
01:12:36,160 --> 01:12:38,754
<i>Shut the windows!</i>

620
01:12:38,920 --> 01:12:41,434
<i>Save yourselves!</i>

621
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,750
<i>They're coming in their millions!</i>

622
01:12:45,600 --> 01:12:50,594
<i>- It's late, my boy. Off to bed
- I'm not sleepy</i>

623
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:55,754
<i>- So many people!
- He died in mortal sin</i>

624
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:31,269
<i>My dear child!</i>

625
01:13:32,920 --> 01:13:36,708
<i>I shall never see you again!</i>

626
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:40,475
<i>Look, at the summit!
Can you see him?</i>

627
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,359
<i>- The Pope!
- Yes, it is</i>

628
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:47,354
<i>So solemn and majestic,
like a warrior</i>

629
01:14:00,800 --> 01:14:02,916
<i>I'll tuck you in</i>

630
01:14:04,480 --> 01:14:07,836
<i>- Good night, my dear
- Good night, Mum</i>

631
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,397
<i>Nothing! The same as usual,
like a tomb</i>

632
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:14,712
- Why the quarantine flag?
- It could be an epidemic

633
01:15:14,880 --> 01:15:17,713
<i>- Typhus would be better than this
- Pablo!</i>

634
01:15:17,880 --> 01:15:20,474
What brings you here?

635
01:15:20,640 --> 01:15:24,315
The same as you, to see
if there's any news

636
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:27,233
- Maybe they're all dead
- You think so?

637
01:15:27,400 --> 01:15:29,994
Sometimes you can smell the stench
from here

638
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:34,517
Perhaps it's the food rotting
in the kitchen

639
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:47,279
<i>Don't shoot! No, don't kill it, please!
It's quite tame. I work here</i>

640
01:15:49,040 --> 01:15:50,996
The cook and the maids...

641
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:53,628
- You told them we were coming?
- I've not said a word

642
01:15:53,800 --> 01:15:55,836
- What are they doing here?
- I don't know

643
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:59,276
Let's find out.
Perhaps they've heard some news

644
01:16:34,480 --> 01:16:38,393
Ral says we'll be free
if Nobile dies

645
01:16:38,560 --> 01:16:40,516
Dead spiders spin no webs

646
01:16:40,680 --> 01:16:43,148
If he had any dignity he'd know
what to do

647
01:16:43,320 --> 01:16:45,675
He's hiding with Leticia

648
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,833
<i>Stop that! It's the most decent
thing you could do</i>

649
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:54,073
Speak up, gentlemen. Let's all
hear your plotting

650
01:16:54,240 --> 01:16:56,390
We want to get rid of him

651
01:16:56,560 --> 01:17:02,590
Are you mad? That's completely
irrational

652
01:17:02,760 --> 01:17:05,194
We don't want reason,
we want to get out

653
01:17:05,360 --> 01:17:09,399
<i>- If you're looking for a fight...
- Alvaro, stand aside!</i>

654
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,632
- We've nothing against you two
- We're justified by necessity

655
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:17,032
<i>- Kill him!
- Better late than never!</i>

656
01:17:17,200 --> 01:17:20,431
<i>- Listen, fools!
- Kill the doctor, too</i>

657
01:17:20,600 --> 01:17:23,114
Why is he trting to stop us?

658
01:17:23,280 --> 01:17:26,875
Think of the terrible consequences
of your actions

659
01:17:27,040 --> 01:17:29,634
This won't be the last vile act

660
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:35,033
It means the disintegration
of human dignity. It's bestial

661
01:17:35,200 --> 01:17:38,715
Stand aside, or I won't answer
for your safety

662
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:41,633
<i>Enough of talking!
Get him!</i>

663
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:54,240
<i>- That's enough, Ral!
- You stay out of this!</i>

664
01:18:06,280 --> 01:18:08,236
<i>Look, it's Nobile!</i>

665
01:18:09,320 --> 01:18:15,714
There's no need for violence. You can
have what you want easily

666
01:18:18,680 --> 01:18:20,636
Thank you, Leticia

667
01:18:57,080 --> 01:18:59,275
Just a moment. Stand still

668
01:19:02,240 --> 01:19:05,198
- What's the matter?
- I don't know

669
01:19:06,720 --> 01:19:08,676
Yes, now I know

670
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,435
It's really extraordinart

671
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:21,195
How long have we been here?
I've lost track of time

672
01:19:21,360 --> 01:19:25,319
Think how often we've changed
positions during...

673
01:19:27,320 --> 01:19:29,914
...this terrible eternity

674
01:19:34,920 --> 01:19:39,869
It's like a chess game.
We have made thousands of moves

675
01:19:40,040 --> 01:19:44,830
We've even moved the furniture
hundreds of times

676
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:52,750
Yet now everything is
just as it was then...

677
01:19:52,920 --> 01:19:55,388
...people and furniture...

678
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,519
...the scene as it was that night

679
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:04,476
Is it another hallucination,
or is it true? Tell me, Alvaro

680
01:20:04,640 --> 01:20:08,918
<i>- Tell me!
- It's true</i>

681
01:20:09,080 --> 01:20:14,518
I was here and you were beside me,
weren't you?

682
01:20:14,680 --> 01:20:16,796
And I was sitting here

683
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:22,830
We sat here and I held
your hand in mine

684
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:28,358
- Who remembers?
- After dinner I sat at the piano

685
01:20:28,520 --> 01:20:32,479
<i>- You were there
- It's true!</i>

686
01:20:32,640 --> 01:20:37,430
That's all vert well,
but what's the point?

687
01:20:44,040 --> 01:20:47,112
Can you remember what you played?

688
01:20:48,560 --> 01:20:50,790
Perfectly

689
01:20:50,960 --> 01:20:55,909
The last piece I played
was a Paradisi sonata

690
01:20:56,080 --> 01:21:02,394
<i>Play it again. Just the end.
Go on, play it!</i>

691
01:21:02,560 --> 01:21:04,516
Play it

692
01:21:08,880 --> 01:21:13,908
You stood behind me. Go on, get up

693
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:44,796
You were clapping

694
01:21:44,960 --> 01:21:49,670
You rose from the piano,
someone came up to you

695
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,716
Who spoke first?

696
01:21:56,120 --> 01:22:01,240
<i>Make an effort!
Trt to remember!</i>

697
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:13,592
An exquisite performance

698
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:17,309
Answer. What would you have replied?

699
01:22:17,480 --> 01:22:19,789
Yes, yes

700
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:24,272
I'm sorrt we have no harpsichord
for you

701
01:22:24,440 --> 01:22:29,514
How superb it would be
with a harpsichord

702
01:22:29,680 --> 01:22:33,468
Now something by Scarlatti,
I beg you

703
01:22:33,640 --> 01:22:38,077
It's late, isn't it?
It's three o'clock

704
01:22:38,240 --> 01:22:42,836
Excuse me, but it's late
and I'm tired

705
01:22:43,000 --> 01:22:47,915
We're all tired and we want
to go home, don't we?

706
01:22:55,760 --> 01:22:59,878
<i>Let's go, then! Come on, follow me!</i>

707
01:23:01,160 --> 01:23:03,116
<i>Follow me!</i>

708
01:23:14,480 --> 01:23:16,516
<i>This way!</i>

709
01:23:36,880 --> 01:23:41,078
- It's good. Brandy from the house?
- My last bottle

710
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:45,550
<i>Look! There's light!</i>

711
01:23:48,080 --> 01:23:52,278
Camila, come here.
Look, the light's on

712
01:23:52,440 --> 01:23:55,512
<i>- It's them
- My goodness!</i>

713
01:23:55,680 --> 01:23:58,194
- Let's go in
- After you

714
01:26:23,800 --> 01:26:25,995
Why not wait for the faithful
to leave?

715
01:26:26,160 --> 01:26:29,516
- Wait? Why?
- Well...

716
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:41,790
- Father...
- Yes?

717
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,512
Something's wrong

718
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,877
- Let's wait a moment
- A good idea

719
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:50,996
I've forgotten my missal

720
01:26:52,200 --> 01:26:55,158
- Why are they not leaving?
- Let me through

721
01:26:55,320 --> 01:26:56,912
I'll explain

722
01:26:57,080 --> 01:26:59,071
- You go first
- I'm in no hurrt

723
01:26:59,240 --> 01:27:01,629
What's going on? Let's go

724
01:28:18,040 --> 01:28:21,749
The End
