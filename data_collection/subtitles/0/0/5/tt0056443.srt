20
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,393
So Mutsuta refused?

21
00:02:41,202 --> 00:02:43,670
Count my uncle out.

22
00:02:43,772 --> 00:02:46,741
I gave him our proposal
to purge the clan of corruption.

23
00:02:46,841 --> 00:02:52,040
He just glanced at it and said,
"I'm aware of the situation."

24
00:02:52,247 --> 00:02:54,715
- Then why does he do nothing?
- I asked him that.

25
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,647
"Why overlook the corruption
of your vice-chamberlain

26
00:02:57,819 --> 00:03:01,016
and provincial steward
in the daimyo's absence?"

27
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,615
He smiled and said,

28
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:07,387
"Perhaps I'm behind it.

29
00:03:08,596 --> 00:03:13,192
You all think I'm a good-natured halfwit,
a scarecrow who'll do your bidding.

30
00:03:13,368 --> 00:03:16,633
People aren't what they seem.
Be careful.

31
00:03:16,905 --> 00:03:21,171
You'd never suspect
who the worst are. Be careful."

32
00:03:21,342 --> 00:03:23,742
Then he tore -
- He tore it up?

33
00:03:25,146 --> 00:03:27,011
He really went too far.

34
00:03:27,749 --> 00:03:28,647
And then?

35
00:03:28,817 --> 00:03:30,717
I gave up on him.

36
00:03:30,885 --> 00:03:34,048
I met with Superintendent Kikui,
as we planned.

37
00:03:34,689 --> 00:03:35,747
What did he say?

38
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:38,392
He understood our position,
just as expected.

39
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,519
At first he seemed troubled and said
he'd discuss it with my uncle,

40
00:03:42,697 --> 00:03:45,325
but when I told him my uncle's words,
he was shocked.

41
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:49,436
He thought about it and said,
"All right. I'm with you.

42
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,843
I'd like to talk with your group.
Gather all your men quickly."

43
00:03:57,011 --> 00:03:57,909
There you have it.

44
00:04:00,014 --> 00:04:02,778
- Kikui's the real thing!
- We can reason with him.

45
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:07,354
He's extremely influential.
He's no good-natured scarecrow.

46
00:04:16,564 --> 00:04:17,895
<i>Wait just a minute.</i>

47
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:39,780
- That's quite a story.
- You heard us? Stop him!

48
00:04:43,558 --> 00:04:44,684
Imbecile.

49
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:47,919
Do I look
like I'm going anywhere?

50
00:04:53,201 --> 00:04:55,396
What the hell
are you doing here?

51
00:04:56,771 --> 00:04:59,569
It's a free room for the night.

52
00:05:00,942 --> 00:05:05,675
By the way,
you should be glad I overheard you.

53
00:05:06,748 --> 00:05:11,151
"The spectator sees more than the player."
He can judge the right course of action.

54
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:13,252
Listen.

55
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:16,681
If you ask me,

56
00:05:16,858 --> 00:05:19,326
the chamberlain is the real thing,

57
00:05:19,694 --> 00:05:22,527
and the superintendent
is a phony.

58
00:05:22,797 --> 00:05:25,322
What? Such insolence
won't go unpunished!

59
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,158
Don't get all testy.

60
00:05:28,469 --> 00:05:30,869
I haven't seen
either of their faces,

61
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:36,003
so I can't be fooled
by their looks.

62
00:05:37,812 --> 00:05:40,975
The chamberlain
is ugly, isn't he?

63
00:05:46,221 --> 00:05:48,155
I guess I must be right.

64
00:05:48,823 --> 00:05:54,227
But judging from your story,
he must be a great man

65
00:05:55,029 --> 00:05:58,965
who doesn't care
if you think he's a fool.

66
00:06:01,836 --> 00:06:04,634
But this Superintendent Kikui -

67
00:06:04,906 --> 00:06:09,570
You say he's the real thing,
"just as expected."

68
00:06:10,979 --> 00:06:15,211
That must mean
he looks the parit.

69
00:06:23,258 --> 00:06:24,885
Am I right?

70
00:06:26,027 --> 00:06:27,995
But people aren't
what they seem.

71
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,655
Be careful.

72
00:06:30,832 --> 00:06:33,266
Enough! What does
a worithless ronin know?

73
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:36,870
I'm just repeating
what the chamberlain said.

74
00:06:37,538 --> 00:06:40,530
Don't you get it?
His words were even more precise:

75
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,375
"You'd never suspect
who the worst are. Be careful."

76
00:06:47,248 --> 00:06:51,776
I may be wrong, but it sounds like
Kikui is the rotten one.

77
00:06:51,953 --> 00:06:53,545
Fool!

78
00:06:53,721 --> 00:06:56,087
Quiet down and listen.

79
00:06:56,324 --> 00:06:58,758
What's the superintendent's job?

80
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:02,222
To quiet discord
in the ranks, right?

81
00:07:02,397 --> 00:07:06,390
Instead,
he's inciting you to revolt.

82
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,793
Don't you find that odd?

83
00:07:16,411 --> 00:07:21,007
What's more,
he told you to gather quickly.

84
00:07:21,182 --> 00:07:23,241
That's a bad sign.

85
00:07:23,718 --> 00:07:27,711
If he's the mastermind,
he can kill you all in one fell swoop.

86
00:07:28,723 --> 00:07:31,954
Don't do as he says.
Just watch and wait.

87
00:07:37,665 --> 00:07:42,728
But we're meeting him
here tonight.

88
00:07:42,904 --> 00:07:45,031
What?

89
00:08:07,929 --> 00:08:10,762
I was right.
Take a look.

90
00:08:59,647 --> 00:09:02,081
We're completely surrounded.

91
00:09:03,151 --> 00:09:05,711
Not even an ant could escape.

92
00:09:22,804 --> 00:09:25,500
The foolishness
never ends, does it?

93
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:28,674
Put your swords away.
This is no time to play war.

94
00:09:28,843 --> 00:09:30,868
Shut up!
We're not listening to you!

95
00:09:31,045 --> 00:09:32,637
Suit yourselves.

96
00:09:32,814 --> 00:09:36,250
I'm sure Kikui will be delighted
to see you all dead.

97
00:09:43,524 --> 00:09:46,618
But... we're surrounded.

98
00:09:48,529 --> 00:09:50,963
Just leave it to me.

99
00:10:07,648 --> 00:10:10,947
Superintendent Kikui sent us.
Surrender!

100
00:10:15,423 --> 00:10:17,288
You're surrounded!

101
00:10:17,925 --> 00:10:19,688
Do not resist!

102
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:32,864
What a racket!
What do you want?

103
00:10:45,686 --> 00:10:47,779
What do you think you're doing?

104
00:10:52,894 --> 00:10:55,920
Take your shoes off
before you go in my room!

105
00:11:03,804 --> 00:11:05,271
Who is this guy?

106
00:11:05,439 --> 00:11:08,135
So... you wanna fight?

107
00:11:08,976 --> 00:11:12,912
Watch out. You woke me up,
and I'm in a bad mood.

108
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,971
Pull back!

109
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:48,006
It's not him we're looking for.

110
00:11:52,386 --> 00:11:56,948
Besides, disposing of this one
would take too long.

111
00:12:00,628 --> 00:12:02,687
You're quite able.

112
00:12:06,033 --> 00:12:09,935
If you wish to serve our clan, come
see me at the superintendent's estate.

113
00:12:11,405 --> 00:12:12,804
My name is Hanbei Muroto.

114
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,768
It's safe now. Come out.

115
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:03,051
We don't know
how to thank you.

116
00:13:03,958 --> 00:13:07,394
No thanks needed,
but some money would be nice.

117
00:13:08,062 --> 00:13:12,590
I've been starving for days.
A cup of sake and some food's enough.

118
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,315
This'll do.

119
00:13:41,429 --> 00:13:42,691
See ya around.

120
00:13:55,976 --> 00:14:00,845
But what will you do now?

121
00:14:02,216 --> 00:14:03,979
You've opened our eyes.

122
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:08,053
We'll rush to apologize to my uncle
and follow his instructions.

123
00:14:09,557 --> 00:14:13,459
Very reasonable.
Good boys.

124
00:14:17,631 --> 00:14:20,930
Wait. That won't do.

125
00:14:22,103 --> 00:14:24,435
The chamberlain's
in danger now.

126
00:14:24,605 --> 00:14:26,630
- The chamberlain?
- That's right.

127
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:30,038
If I were Kikui, I'd arrest him,

128
00:14:30,444 --> 00:14:33,902
since he seems to know
that Kikui is behind the corruption.

129
00:14:44,058 --> 00:14:45,753
- Where are you going?
- To my uncle's.

130
00:14:45,926 --> 00:14:47,951
So they can catch you?

131
00:14:48,162 --> 00:14:51,063
They know you.
Show your face and you're finished.

132
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:53,894
But it's my fault.
If I hadn't been so stupid -

133
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,798
We're all responsible.
You were just following our plan.

134
00:14:57,972 --> 00:15:00,236
But if anything happens
to my uncle -

135
00:15:00,407 --> 00:15:02,375
Idiot! Stop saying "my uncle"!

136
00:15:02,543 --> 00:15:05,842
You can't just act
on your own whims.

137
00:15:06,313 --> 00:15:07,678
That's right.

138
00:15:08,015 --> 00:15:10,745
The nine of us
are in this together.

139
00:15:15,089 --> 00:15:16,283
The ten of us!

140
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:19,493
I can't watch you
blunder your way to your deaths.

141
00:15:44,952 --> 00:15:47,978
It's quiet.
Everything seems all right.

142
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:52,421
No, something's wrong.
The shutters are usually closed now.

143
00:15:54,128 --> 00:15:56,187
Are there fish in this pond?

144
00:15:58,199 --> 00:16:00,064
A lot of big carp.

145
00:16:22,690 --> 00:16:24,419
Must have been a fish.

146
00:16:41,242 --> 00:16:44,507
Just as you suspected.
Those three are Kikui's men.

147
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,580
That's my uncle's room.
He must be in trouble.

148
00:16:49,049 --> 00:16:52,485
Don't be hasty.
Let's wait and see.

149
00:17:06,934 --> 00:17:10,335
We can't move like this,
like a centipede.

150
00:17:11,071 --> 00:17:13,539
Is there somewhere
we can hide?

151
00:17:13,707 --> 00:17:15,868
There's a barn just ahead.

152
00:17:16,043 --> 00:17:18,102
Good. Let's go.

153
00:17:36,897 --> 00:17:39,229
Koiso! What's wrong?

154
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:41,360
Master Izaka!

155
00:17:49,176 --> 00:17:51,303
Fool! This is no time for tears.

156
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:54,073
My lord is in terrible trouble!

157
00:17:54,248 --> 00:17:56,910
Calm down.
Tell us what happened.

158
00:17:57,584 --> 00:18:01,577
The superintendent suddenly
arrived with a host of men.

159
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:05,247
We were eating -
- Never mind that. Where's my uncle?

160
00:18:05,426 --> 00:18:07,417
Ten men took him away.

161
00:18:07,594 --> 00:18:10,495
Where the hell were the guards?

162
00:18:10,664 --> 00:18:14,930
They were taken by surprise
and locked up in the main house.

163
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:16,501
And my aunt?

164
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:19,696
I don't know.
Probably under watch somewhere.

165
00:18:19,873 --> 00:18:21,033
And Chidori?

166
00:18:21,508 --> 00:18:24,944
I think she's with her mother.

167
00:18:25,879 --> 00:18:29,178
- How many men are on watch?
- Fouriteen or 15.

168
00:18:29,550 --> 00:18:31,381
Then how did you escape?

169
00:18:31,552 --> 00:18:33,816
The sentries asked me
to get some sake,

170
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,218
so I pretended to go
to the kitchen.

171
00:18:36,390 --> 00:18:39,553
- Unaccompanied?
- A man followed me the first time.

172
00:18:39,727 --> 00:18:42,560
This time they let me go alone.

173
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:44,991
Send her right back.

174
00:18:45,165 --> 00:18:48,134
- Send her back?
- Yes, to Kikui's men.

175
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:52,063
Too bad,
since she managed to get away,

176
00:18:52,272 --> 00:18:55,139
but they'll raise the alarm
if she disappears.

177
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:59,711
Best to get them
drunk on sake.

178
00:19:00,514 --> 00:19:04,177
Then we can rescue
the chamberlain's old lady and the girl.

179
00:19:05,686 --> 00:19:06,983
I see.

180
00:19:07,755 --> 00:19:10,019
Koiso, will you go back?

181
00:19:14,728 --> 00:19:16,923
Yes, I will.

182
00:19:24,104 --> 00:19:25,833
Now there's a samurai.

183
00:19:28,509 --> 00:19:30,136
More reliable than all of you.

184
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:49,655
We're grateful,
but please watch your language.

185
00:19:49,930 --> 00:19:52,262
Calling the chamberlain's wife
his "old lady"...

186
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:56,830
And it's annoying to have you
decide our every move.

187
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,569
You want to rescue
the ladies first,

188
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:02,675
but the chamberlain's safety
is more pressing.

189
00:20:02,943 --> 00:20:07,039
Very well.
Where is he then?

190
00:20:07,881 --> 00:20:10,509
We can't rescue him
without knowing where he is.

191
00:20:10,784 --> 00:20:14,777
What's the superintendent
planning to do with him?

192
00:20:14,955 --> 00:20:18,447
We can't do anything
without knowing that.

193
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:25,121
Kikui must've told the old lady
why he hauled her husband off.

194
00:20:26,433 --> 00:20:29,231
Don't you wanna ask her
what she knows?

195
00:20:35,609 --> 00:20:37,008
Understand now?

196
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:39,305
Good. Now split up.

197
00:20:39,613 --> 00:20:44,209
You three and I
will rescue the old lady.

198
00:20:44,885 --> 00:20:47,479
The rest of you,
look for the chamberlain.

199
00:20:48,689 --> 00:20:53,626
We'll meet in a safe place.
Is there anything around here?

200
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:58,062
We can't go far at night
with the ladies in tow.

201
00:20:58,265 --> 00:21:00,062
My house is closest.

202
00:21:00,234 --> 00:21:03,328
Are you crazy?
You're next door to Kurofuji.

203
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:08,566
- Who's Kurofuji?
- One of the traitors. A vice-chamberlain.

204
00:21:09,176 --> 00:21:11,303
Sounds like fun.
Let's meet there.

205
00:21:11,478 --> 00:21:13,275
That's ridiculous!

206
00:21:13,447 --> 00:21:17,383
Were you born in the Year of the Ox?
You always fly off the handle.

207
00:21:19,186 --> 00:21:23,680
Nobody thinks to look
right under his own nose.

208
00:22:07,134 --> 00:22:09,068
There are three guards.

209
00:22:10,737 --> 00:22:15,470
I'll knock one down,
and you two take him prisoner.

210
00:22:16,043 --> 00:22:17,567
Don't kill him.

211
00:22:17,945 --> 00:22:21,176
He may tell us
where the chamberlain is.

212
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,950
While I do away
with the other two,

213
00:22:28,188 --> 00:22:31,123
you rush in
and rescue the women folk.

214
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:36,251
We'll meet back at the barn.
Got it?

215
00:22:46,607 --> 00:22:48,734
Why are you looking
at me like that?

216
00:22:49,543 --> 00:22:52,478
You want to draw your swords?
Forget it.

217
00:22:52,746 --> 00:22:55,442
A stupid friend's sword
is deadlier than an enemy's.

218
00:22:55,716 --> 00:22:58,150
I don't want to get cut to pieces.

219
00:23:05,659 --> 00:23:10,494
That's the guardhouse.
Your plan seems to have worked.

220
00:23:13,734 --> 00:23:15,895
Now's our chance.

221
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:49,034
That was close.

222
00:23:49,236 --> 00:23:51,136
They've changed the guard.

223
00:23:51,305 --> 00:23:54,035
Muroto.
You just met him at the shrine.

224
00:23:56,176 --> 00:23:59,077
He offered me a job.

225
00:23:59,246 --> 00:24:01,840
What's he do for Kikui?
- Henchman and enforcer.

226
00:24:02,049 --> 00:24:05,280
Let's go now. He's alone.

227
00:24:05,452 --> 00:24:07,181
Are you blind?

228
00:24:07,854 --> 00:24:10,379
Those three guards
are kitty cats.

229
00:24:11,258 --> 00:24:14,421
He may be alone,
but he's a tiger.

230
00:24:34,448 --> 00:24:36,245
What's the hell's that racket?

231
00:24:37,084 --> 00:24:40,178
The guards are drunk, sir.

232
00:24:46,460 --> 00:24:48,587
Your faces are red.

233
00:24:51,398 --> 00:24:53,832
Wash them in the pond.

234
00:25:07,981 --> 00:25:09,573
Do it!

235
00:25:14,788 --> 00:25:17,655
I'm going to the main house.
Stand guard.

236
00:25:46,653 --> 00:25:52,455
Kikui said he arrested Uncle to stop him
from destroying evidence of corruption.

237
00:25:52,626 --> 00:25:54,389
Is that right?

238
00:25:55,729 --> 00:25:58,926
<i>He thought of everything,</i>
<i>didn't he?</i>

239
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,736
Who is that gentleman?

240
00:26:07,140 --> 00:26:12,134
It's hard to explain. A strange series
of events has made him our ally.

241
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:16,442
Indeed, he saved our lives.
- Is that so?

242
00:26:17,050 --> 00:26:18,915
Thank you.

243
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,306
What's keeping those two?
It's dangerous staying here.

244
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:45,508
Yes, but I've never run so
in my entire life.

245
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:49,240
I must rest a bit
or I shan't even be able to walk.

246
00:26:54,588 --> 00:26:57,751
This is my first time here.

247
00:26:58,391 --> 00:27:01,554
The hay smells lovely.

248
00:27:01,728 --> 00:27:05,061
I love this smell.

249
00:27:05,899 --> 00:27:10,063
We come here often,
don't we, lori?

250
00:27:15,809 --> 00:27:17,743
I'll find those two.

251
00:27:21,081 --> 00:27:24,016
Why do you two come here?

252
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,675
It's so quiet,
even in the daytime.

253
00:27:26,887 --> 00:27:32,223
You can lean back in the hay
and feel like you're floating.

254
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:37,987
Enveloped in its scent,
you drift into a dreamy haze.

255
00:27:38,932 --> 00:27:40,524
You know,

256
00:27:41,201 --> 00:27:47,071
I even fell asleep once
on lori's arm.

257
00:27:50,243 --> 00:27:52,234
Not very ladylike.

258
00:27:54,114 --> 00:27:55,775
But...

259
00:27:56,550 --> 00:27:58,745
actually...

260
00:28:02,489 --> 00:28:05,185
it does smell nice.

261
00:28:16,069 --> 00:28:17,434
No wonder they were late.

262
00:28:17,637 --> 00:28:21,334
They were dunking his head in the pond
to make him spit out my uncle's location.

263
00:28:22,375 --> 00:28:24,502
Stubborn bastard wouldn't talk.

264
00:28:25,445 --> 00:28:28,414
- Only spat out water, eh?
- He may not know anything.

265
00:28:28,582 --> 00:28:30,550
Why should I talk?

266
00:28:31,551 --> 00:28:32,848
Son of a bitch!

267
00:28:33,486 --> 00:28:34,453
What do we do?

268
00:28:34,621 --> 00:28:37,215
He saw our faces.
We have to kill him.

269
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:39,585
That just won't do.

270
00:28:40,727 --> 00:28:44,424
And you killed
the other two as well, didn't you?

271
00:28:47,334 --> 00:28:50,565
I did it to rescue you.
I had no choice.

272
00:28:50,737 --> 00:28:55,436
I hesitate to say this
after you so kindly saved us,

273
00:28:56,142 --> 00:28:59,305
but killing people
is a bad habit.

274
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:11,246
You glisten too brightly.

275
00:29:12,359 --> 00:29:14,452
- Glisten?
- Yes.

276
00:29:14,928 --> 00:29:16,418
Like a drawn sword.

277
00:29:16,596 --> 00:29:18,461
A drawn sword?

278
00:29:19,633 --> 00:29:24,263
You're like a sword
without a sheath.

279
00:29:24,437 --> 00:29:26,667
You cut well,

280
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,107
but the best sword
is kept in its sheath.

281
00:29:36,983 --> 00:29:39,747
So what do we do with him?

282
00:29:42,022 --> 00:29:45,458
Come with us, will you?

283
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:48,654
We won't harm you.

284
00:29:51,631 --> 00:29:53,531
<i>- Over here!</i>
<i>- What is it?</i>

285
00:29:55,902 --> 00:29:58,097
Hurry!
Over the rear wall!

286
00:30:15,655 --> 00:30:17,247
That way!

287
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:20,015
Guard the front gate!

288
00:30:23,229 --> 00:30:24,821
Hurry!

289
00:30:25,298 --> 00:30:30,258
That may be easy for you,
but for us it's impossible.

290
00:30:30,437 --> 00:30:31,529
Just try.

291
00:30:31,705 --> 00:30:34,833
We can't.
Isn't that right, Mother?

292
00:30:35,008 --> 00:30:36,999
Hurry!

293
00:30:38,445 --> 00:30:40,743
Use me as a footstool.

294
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,317
- No, I couldn't.
- Never mind that.

295
00:30:45,485 --> 00:30:46,975
But -

296
00:30:47,153 --> 00:30:51,852
No buts. Your hesitation
will force me to kill more men.

297
00:30:52,792 --> 00:30:53,986
Hurry!

298
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:56,060
Please forgive me.

299
00:31:09,142 --> 00:31:10,700
Please hurry.

300
00:31:11,845 --> 00:31:14,336
We can't let
Kurofuji's men see us.

301
00:31:35,902 --> 00:31:40,271
- I'm hungry. Get me some food.
- The servants are making rice balls.

302
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,907
Got any sake?

303
00:31:42,075 --> 00:31:46,739
This is no time for drinking.
We need to plan our next steps.

304
00:31:47,247 --> 00:31:49,579
I'm smariter when I drink.

305
00:31:52,619 --> 00:31:56,988
Sounds like Kikui plans to pin
his crimes on Chamberlain Mutsuta.

306
00:31:57,157 --> 00:32:01,184
They may even force him
to write a confession, and then -

307
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,489
And then what?

308
00:32:10,770 --> 00:32:14,331
You can be frank with us.

309
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:23,046
They'll make him commit harakiri.

310
00:32:25,051 --> 00:32:27,042
What shall we do, Mother?

311
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:29,120
There's nothing to fear.

312
00:32:29,389 --> 00:32:32,654
Your father is a shrewd old fox.

313
00:32:32,826 --> 00:32:37,456
It won't be easy to make him
commit harakiri.

314
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,902
Now, what do you gentlemen
intend to do next?

315
00:32:47,507 --> 00:32:51,671
First we'll find Uncle
and bring him back. Then -

316
00:32:51,845 --> 00:32:53,813
That's all you need to do.

317
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,347
Pinning the blame on your uncle
is practically a confession of guilt.

318
00:32:59,986 --> 00:33:02,887
If we rescue him,
they're finished.

319
00:33:05,525 --> 00:33:07,652
That's quite correct.

320
00:33:07,827 --> 00:33:10,318
But can we get him back?

321
00:33:10,496 --> 00:33:12,862
If not, we're the ones
who're finished.

322
00:33:13,933 --> 00:33:17,266
Well, then,
please do your best.

323
00:33:25,879 --> 00:33:30,475
But please refrain
from excessive violence.

324
00:33:33,786 --> 00:33:36,949
By the way,
may we know your name?

325
00:33:37,457 --> 00:33:38,856
My name?

326
00:33:51,905 --> 00:33:53,634
My name is...

327
00:34:02,882 --> 00:34:06,181
Sanjuro Tsubaki...
(30-year-old Camellia)

328
00:34:06,352 --> 00:34:08,582
Though I'm now almost 40.

329
00:34:10,723 --> 00:34:13,385
You're a most interesting man.

330
00:34:17,030 --> 00:34:21,262
Speaking of camellias,
those are truly splendid.

331
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:25,598
Kurofuji's estate has so many
that it's called Camellia Mansion.

332
00:34:25,972 --> 00:34:27,963
Let's see
what they're up to.

333
00:34:41,721 --> 00:34:43,154
Anything happening?

334
00:34:47,727 --> 00:34:49,251
It's very quiet.

335
00:35:14,253 --> 00:35:15,652
Who's there?

336
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:19,019
It's just the camellias.

337
00:35:21,627 --> 00:35:26,792
Why don't you calm down
and have another drink?

338
00:35:31,637 --> 00:35:34,629
But Kurofuji,
what's going to happen?

339
00:35:35,008 --> 00:35:39,274
I doubt Mutsuta will write
a confession so easily.

340
00:35:39,445 --> 00:35:42,881
Leave that to Kikui.
Have a drink.

341
00:35:44,150 --> 00:35:47,984
But Kikui's made
one blunder after another.

342
00:36:10,410 --> 00:36:14,369
Chamberlain Mutsuta
is making trouble.

343
00:36:15,581 --> 00:36:17,606
We underestimated him.
- You mean -

344
00:36:17,784 --> 00:36:20,150
No, there's still a way.

345
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:23,515
We'll use his wife and daughter.

346
00:36:24,557 --> 00:36:27,424
Who's there?
<i>- Muroto.</i>

347
00:36:41,107 --> 00:36:43,575
Muroto's reporiting
to Kurofuji right now.

348
00:36:43,743 --> 00:36:46,007
Telling him he lost my aunt
and Chidori, no doubt.

349
00:36:46,179 --> 00:36:48,841
If he's taking
that reporit next door,

350
00:36:49,048 --> 00:36:51,073
that means the traitors
are there right now.

351
00:36:51,284 --> 00:36:53,582
The three of them
must be hatching a scheme.

352
00:36:53,853 --> 00:36:58,586
If they're in that house,
my uncle must be there too.

353
00:36:59,659 --> 00:37:02,423
You idiot!
What were the guards doing?

354
00:37:03,629 --> 00:37:07,429
Now what? We can't use
the women anymore.

355
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:09,534
Actually, we can.

356
00:37:09,869 --> 00:37:13,270
Mutsuta doesn't know
we lost them.

357
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:17,972
The problem is,
they must be watching our homes.

358
00:37:18,611 --> 00:37:22,809
They saw you enter.
They'll know we're here.

359
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:26,179
- We're in danger!
- Don't worry.

360
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:31,649
I sent messengers
to your homes as well.

361
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,758
Something's fishy at Kikui's place.
A man just rushed in.

362
00:37:36,929 --> 00:37:38,328
What?

363
00:37:39,098 --> 00:37:42,761
There's a commotion at Takebayashi's.
A messenger just barreled in.

364
00:37:44,804 --> 00:37:46,829
It seems they're not together.

365
00:37:47,006 --> 00:37:49,372
Then where's my uncle?

366
00:37:49,542 --> 00:37:55,071
They'll eventually have to meet
where they have him confined.

367
00:37:55,248 --> 00:37:56,738
We must wait for now.

368
00:37:56,916 --> 00:38:00,784
Don't just wait.
The chamberlain has disappeared.

369
00:38:01,420 --> 00:38:05,948
Raise a stink so people
demand to know why.

370
00:38:06,893 --> 00:38:12,024
They want to kill him
before that happens. Don't let them.

371
00:38:12,532 --> 00:38:15,558
They'll panic
and have a meeting.

372
00:38:25,478 --> 00:38:27,912
- The emergency drum!
- What's going on?

373
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:29,513
It's parit of our plan.

374
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:51,267
"We have found that Chamberlain
Mutsuta abused his authority.

375
00:38:51,437 --> 00:38:57,171
Accused of malfeasance,
he tried to destroy the evidence.

376
00:38:57,610 --> 00:38:59,441
Therefore,

377
00:38:59,612 --> 00:39:03,412
the elders have sent a messenger
to Edo for instructions

378
00:39:03,616 --> 00:39:08,383
and detained the chamberlain
as a precaution.

379
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,149
He seems to have
many followers.

380
00:39:12,325 --> 00:39:16,261
Remain calm.
Do not let them incite you.

381
00:39:16,429 --> 00:39:18,090
Superintendent Kikui."

382
00:39:23,069 --> 00:39:24,969
They beat us to the punch.

383
00:39:25,338 --> 00:39:27,238
They're clever enemies.

384
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,974
This is bad.

385
00:39:30,309 --> 00:39:34,712
With the clan on their side,
we can't do anything.

386
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:38,179
Whatever we do
only proves their claims.

387
00:39:39,452 --> 00:39:42,319
Meanwhile, they'll have
time to carry out their plan.

388
00:39:42,488 --> 00:39:45,582
They won't make any rash moves.
- Yes, they will.

389
00:39:46,926 --> 00:39:49,588
They don't know
there are only ten of us.

390
00:39:49,762 --> 00:39:52,526
They said "many followers," right?

391
00:39:53,232 --> 00:39:55,632
They can't sit idly by.

392
00:40:00,673 --> 00:40:03,733
<i>At any rate, we've done</i>
<i>everything we could.</i>

393
00:40:05,311 --> 00:40:07,677
<i>Relax, Takebayashi.</i>

394
00:40:07,847 --> 00:40:10,179
We must focus
on breaking Mutsuta down.

395
00:40:10,349 --> 00:40:11,748
And his men?

396
00:40:11,917 --> 00:40:14,442
Their hands are tied.

397
00:40:15,588 --> 00:40:20,992
That's what worries me.
Desperate men will try anything.

398
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,856
They're too dangerous.
We must act.

399
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,600
Very well.
Here's what we'll do.

400
00:40:30,102 --> 00:40:33,435
We'll lure them out
once again, and then -

401
00:40:33,806 --> 00:40:35,034
How will you do that?

402
00:40:35,207 --> 00:40:36,572
There's one way:

403
00:40:36,942 --> 00:40:40,571
Let them know
where the chamberlain is.

404
00:40:42,782 --> 00:40:46,218
As you said,

405
00:40:46,419 --> 00:40:51,118
they're desperate and will try
anything to get him back.

406
00:40:52,224 --> 00:40:53,350
We'll arrest them
when they arrive.

407
00:40:54,126 --> 00:40:57,061
Idiot! Are you mad?

408
00:40:57,229 --> 00:41:00,164
I was afraid it would come to this.
- Listen.

409
00:41:00,633 --> 00:41:03,431
It won't be here, of course.

410
00:41:03,602 --> 00:41:07,333
We can lure them
to a place of our choosing.

411
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:10,964
We just let them know
where we'll be meeting.

412
00:41:11,177 --> 00:41:15,307
- Never!
- Don't worry. There'll be no danger.

413
00:41:16,482 --> 00:41:20,384
Our palanquins will arrive
at the meeting,

414
00:41:20,553 --> 00:41:23,886
but we don't have
to be in them.

415
00:41:43,476 --> 00:41:45,273
They're finally making a move!

416
00:41:45,478 --> 00:41:47,776
I'll follow them.
Tell the others.

417
00:42:10,703 --> 00:42:13,467
Kurofuji left in a palanquin.

418
00:42:19,311 --> 00:42:21,575
Kurofuji's arrived
at Kikui's house.

419
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:24,113
<i>- Kikui's house?</i>
<i>- That means -</i>

420
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,215
Two palanquins
have left Kikui's.

421
00:42:29,388 --> 00:42:32,084
<i>- Two?</i>
- Kurofuji and Kikui.

422
00:42:32,358 --> 00:42:34,121
<i>Where the hell are they going?</i>

423
00:42:36,662 --> 00:42:38,789
They've entered
Takebayashi's compound.

424
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:40,761
All three in the same place?

425
00:42:40,933 --> 00:42:42,525
- That means -
- Yes, it must.

426
00:42:46,005 --> 00:42:48,098
Three palanquins
have left Takebayashi's place.

427
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:51,300
They took the Akamatsu road west.
- West?

428
00:42:51,477 --> 00:42:53,138
Kurofuji's villa is along that road.

429
00:42:53,312 --> 00:42:55,177
That's the place. Let's go!

430
00:42:55,347 --> 00:42:56,609
Wait.

431
00:42:57,583 --> 00:43:00,108
If their men see you,
you're in trouble.

432
00:43:00,286 --> 00:43:04,120
But there's only
one guard per palanquin.

433
00:43:04,290 --> 00:43:09,785
This is fishy. The ten of us
could easily capture them all.

434
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:11,190
Good idea!

435
00:43:11,363 --> 00:43:13,331
Capture them,
then make 'em talk.

436
00:43:13,499 --> 00:43:17,526
Fool! Doesn't it seem
too good to be true?

437
00:43:18,037 --> 00:43:20,835
And if it seems so,
it usually is.

438
00:43:21,006 --> 00:43:24,533
But we can't
let this chance slip away.

439
00:43:24,743 --> 00:43:27,473
Let's follow them for now.

440
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,444
Circumstances will decide
whether we attack or not.

441
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:32,549
What do you say?

442
00:43:33,285 --> 00:43:37,688
It's a stupid plan, but some excitement
might keep me awake.

443
00:44:27,373 --> 00:44:30,137
- Are they really inside?
- How should he know?

444
00:44:30,309 --> 00:44:32,174
Are there any booby traps?

445
00:44:32,344 --> 00:44:35,404
Idiot! That's even harder to tell.
What about hidden guards?

446
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:37,446
None at all.

447
00:44:37,616 --> 00:44:39,516
Good, let's attack.

448
00:44:39,685 --> 00:44:41,846
Quickly, before they enter the villa!

449
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,912
Wait.

450
00:44:44,557 --> 00:44:47,025
I don't like the looks of this.

451
00:45:15,654 --> 00:45:17,622
I told you to wait.

452
00:45:17,890 --> 00:45:20,825
Something's not right here.
- Shut up!

453
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:24,024
Suit yourselves.
It isn't my problem.

454
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:26,955
Let's go!

455
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,651
Pardon us.

456
00:45:56,829 --> 00:46:01,926
These seem to be the palanquins
of our clan leaders.

457
00:46:02,101 --> 00:46:06,003
We learned today
of the chamberlain's misdeeds

458
00:46:06,171 --> 00:46:08,867
and that he has many followers.

459
00:46:09,074 --> 00:46:11,668
It's careless to have
so few guards.

460
00:46:11,877 --> 00:46:16,712
We offer you our services.

461
00:46:19,918 --> 00:46:23,479
Surrender!

462
00:46:23,656 --> 00:46:24,782
You're under arrest!

463
00:46:24,990 --> 00:46:26,116
Under arrest?

464
00:46:27,192 --> 00:46:31,629
Don't play dumb! Do you claim
not to be the chamberlain's men?

465
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:35,228
The chamberlain's men?
That's ridiculous!

466
00:46:35,868 --> 00:46:39,133
Your denials ring hollow!
This is all Lord Kikui's trap.

467
00:46:39,304 --> 00:46:43,035
You followed these decoy palanquins
right to your own downfall.

468
00:46:43,242 --> 00:46:45,005
Wait.

469
00:46:57,022 --> 00:47:00,822
I'm out of patience.
I've had enough of you idiots.

470
00:47:16,075 --> 00:47:17,440
How did you get out?

471
00:47:19,178 --> 00:47:24,047
I happened to sneeze loudly,
and the lady heard me.

472
00:47:24,216 --> 00:47:26,582
She let me out of the closet.

473
00:47:28,854 --> 00:47:30,788
This fool's wearing my best kimono.

474
00:47:30,956 --> 00:47:33,049
I apologize.
She let me wear it.

475
00:47:34,026 --> 00:47:36,051
But why didn't you escape?

476
00:47:38,497 --> 00:47:43,662
It never occurred to the lady
that I would, so I couldn't.

477
00:47:44,870 --> 00:47:48,567
Also, I've overheard
your discussions since last night,

478
00:47:48,741 --> 00:47:51,676
and they contradict
everything I've been told.

479
00:47:52,044 --> 00:47:53,807
I've learned a great deal.

480
00:48:00,219 --> 00:48:01,618
Now, if you'll excuse me.

481
00:48:11,363 --> 00:48:14,628
The lady is hopelessly na<i>:</i>ve.

482
00:48:15,634 --> 00:48:17,864
She's a little slow, that's all.

483
00:48:20,372 --> 00:48:24,672
So you mean the horsemen
weren't the conspirators?

484
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:26,242
Yes.

485
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:29,742
We know that...

486
00:48:31,283 --> 00:48:34,878
because we released them,
but they refused to go.

487
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:41,824
They even went to the estate,
demanding an explanation.

488
00:48:46,498 --> 00:48:50,195
Trapped by your own little tricks!

489
00:48:50,369 --> 00:48:53,861
You've made yet more enemies.

490
00:48:54,039 --> 00:48:55,768
I wonder about that.

491
00:48:56,408 --> 00:49:00,344
They were coming
to our defense.

492
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:06,648
If we explain why we used the decoys,
they may agree to help us.

493
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:07,876
What do you think?

494
00:49:08,187 --> 00:49:12,556
Indeed.
They're proud of their skills

495
00:49:12,825 --> 00:49:14,952
and will gladly
use them to aid us.

496
00:49:15,127 --> 00:49:16,458
Good.

497
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,495
Add them to my roster
and send them here.

498
00:49:20,032 --> 00:49:25,595
This isn't like you.
That will reveal that we're here.

499
00:49:26,772 --> 00:49:29,104
And why not?

500
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,203
It's time for a showdown.

501
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:47,485
We've come as far as we can.

502
00:49:49,361 --> 00:49:52,091
Judging from those horsemen,

503
00:49:52,264 --> 00:49:55,062
the clan members
are all on the traitors' side.

504
00:49:55,300 --> 00:49:56,892
That's right.

505
00:49:57,202 --> 00:49:59,636
We're as good as dead.

506
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:02,867
We don't stand a chance, do we?

507
00:50:03,242 --> 00:50:07,872
It doesn't matter. Live or die,
the nine of us are together.

508
00:50:08,480 --> 00:50:10,209
Ten of us.

509
00:50:16,288 --> 00:50:18,188
I'll go see Kikui.

510
00:50:19,658 --> 00:50:21,785
What for?

511
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:23,894
To offer my services.

512
00:50:24,529 --> 00:50:27,054
Muroto kindly offered me a job.

513
00:50:42,881 --> 00:50:45,247
- Where are you going?
- After him.

514
00:50:45,417 --> 00:50:47,885
- To see what he's up to.
- What if he betrays us?

515
00:50:48,353 --> 00:50:49,820
Idiots!

516
00:50:50,722 --> 00:50:53,156
Why tell us his plan
if he intends to betray us?

517
00:50:53,325 --> 00:50:55,987
Muroto's invitation allows him
to look around the grounds.

518
00:50:56,161 --> 00:50:58,095
- I agree.
- Me too.

519
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:01,357
- Shut up, little boy!
- No! He would never do that to us!

520
00:51:01,533 --> 00:51:04,229
I'd like to think so too,
but the way he said it -

521
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:07,633
He was just provoking us.
That's how he is.

522
00:51:08,774 --> 00:51:10,503
It's true.

523
00:51:10,676 --> 00:51:13,975
But you never know
what he'll do.

524
00:51:15,013 --> 00:51:16,310
He's a monster!

525
00:51:40,005 --> 00:51:44,135
- What the hell do you want?
- Tell Muroto I'm here.

526
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,140
He's busy!

527
00:52:23,081 --> 00:52:25,572
So you made it!

528
00:52:26,485 --> 00:52:28,214
I've been waiting for you.

529
00:52:29,988 --> 00:52:34,049
But I hear you're busy.
I'll come again.

530
00:52:34,393 --> 00:52:36,554
I don't mind. Come in.

531
00:52:45,270 --> 00:52:47,465
I don't care what you say.
I trust him.

532
00:52:47,672 --> 00:52:50,368
Think how many times
he's saved our lives!

533
00:52:50,542 --> 00:52:52,942
It doesn't mean
he'll do it again!

534
00:52:53,111 --> 00:52:55,341
Why should we mean
anything to him?

535
00:52:55,514 --> 00:52:58,039
He has to worry about himself.

536
00:52:58,216 --> 00:53:01,481
He has a job waiting
if he turns us in.

537
00:53:01,653 --> 00:53:05,453
How dare you! He may dress in rags,
but he's a true samurai.

538
00:53:05,724 --> 00:53:09,683
Look how he thrashed Kikui's men!
- Quiet!

539
00:53:09,895 --> 00:53:14,923
He begged us for money.
A samurai would starve rather than beg.

540
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:18,900
He's just outspoken
and a bit eccentric.

541
00:53:19,071 --> 00:53:20,971
I refuse to doubt him.

542
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:23,903
He's a good man.
I don't care what logic says.

543
00:53:24,076 --> 00:53:28,069
You're the lady's kin.
You'll trust anyone, but -

544
00:53:28,413 --> 00:53:29,903
What is it?

545
00:53:35,253 --> 00:53:40,486
You were shouting so loudly.
Mother sent me to ask what's wrong.

546
00:53:40,926 --> 00:53:42,553
Nothing.

547
00:53:44,329 --> 00:53:45,227
But -

548
00:53:45,397 --> 00:53:46,489
It's nothing!

549
00:53:56,775 --> 00:53:58,970
<i>Excuse me.</i>

550
00:54:04,549 --> 00:54:07,609
I've been listening carefully
from the closet.

551
00:54:07,786 --> 00:54:10,380
- Get back in there!
- In a moment.

552
00:54:10,889 --> 00:54:14,052
I trust that ronin as well.

553
00:54:14,326 --> 00:54:15,793
Please listen.

554
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:21,327
It may sound strange,
but when the lady climbed the wall,

555
00:54:21,600 --> 00:54:25,969
he got on all fours
to serve as her footstool.

556
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:30,741
He was moved by her purity of soul.
That alone shows he's a good man.

557
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:35,141
Nonsense!
He called her "a little slow."

558
00:54:35,947 --> 00:54:40,008
As someone said,
that's just his odd way of speaking.

559
00:54:40,185 --> 00:54:42,847
His praise
comes out as abuse.

560
00:54:48,493 --> 00:54:51,485
- Now you understand?
- No, I don't!

561
00:54:52,097 --> 00:54:54,258
- You still insist?
- Enough talk!

562
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:57,333
We're following him.
He's dangerous.

563
00:54:57,602 --> 00:54:59,593
We mustn't fight
among ourselves.

564
00:54:59,804 --> 00:55:03,001
Our judgment will be skewed
if only the doubters go.

565
00:55:03,208 --> 00:55:05,972
Let's take two from each side.

566
00:55:06,144 --> 00:55:10,604
Yasukawa and Kawahara,
Izaka and Hirose.

567
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:47,849
The household is nearly empty,
so we can't welcome you properly.

568
00:55:48,486 --> 00:55:51,284
But we can still
share a drink.

569
00:55:55,827 --> 00:55:57,658
I'm grateful.

570
00:55:58,697 --> 00:56:04,101
With your help,
we'll see some real results.

571
00:56:05,704 --> 00:56:08,070
You came just in time.

572
00:56:09,241 --> 00:56:11,038
I saw the notice board.

573
00:56:11,209 --> 00:56:14,178
It's seems
there's unrest in the clan.

574
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:19,414
A large contingent of men just left.
Where did they go?

575
00:56:19,951 --> 00:56:22,146
I'll take you there now.

576
00:56:25,457 --> 00:56:30,224
Just so you know, everything
in that notice was a bald-faced lie.

577
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,794
Superintendent Kikui
is the rotten one.

578
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:38,162
- But you're his -
- Retainer.

579
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:42,033
Like attracts like.
I'm rotten too.

580
00:56:46,811 --> 00:56:51,544
You see, Chamberlain Mutsuta
is a shrewd character.

581
00:56:51,716 --> 00:56:53,741
Not easy to break.

582
00:56:53,985 --> 00:56:59,048
But with him out of the way,
this clan is ours for the taking.

583
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:03,453
Kikui is cunning
but not a commanding presence.

584
00:57:03,728 --> 00:57:06,094
He pushes Mutsuta
out of the way -

585
00:57:07,132 --> 00:57:09,100
And you and I eat him up.

586
00:57:09,668 --> 00:57:11,329
Precisely.

587
00:57:14,172 --> 00:57:17,141
I'll take you to him now.

588
00:57:18,343 --> 00:57:21,938
But remember:
He has an inflated view of himself, so -

589
00:57:22,781 --> 00:57:26,182
Stroke his ego
and he'll purr?

590
00:57:27,786 --> 00:57:31,745
You catch on fast.
Good boy.

591
00:57:51,142 --> 00:57:52,871
Someone's following us.

592
00:57:55,447 --> 00:57:57,506
Turn right at the corner.

593
00:58:33,451 --> 00:58:34,611
Take them alive!

594
00:58:43,595 --> 00:58:44,755
Fool! What's this?

595
00:58:44,929 --> 00:58:47,762
I was against it,
but they said you'd betray us.

596
00:58:47,932 --> 00:58:51,265
Idiot! Now you'll have
to give yourself up.

597
00:58:51,436 --> 00:58:55,065
Muroto's coming. Attack me!
Don't just stand there!

598
00:58:57,242 --> 00:58:58,266
Come on!

599
00:59:06,418 --> 00:59:09,876
This greenhorn here
put up a good fight.

600
00:59:12,690 --> 00:59:16,421
A fine present.
He's the leader of the resistance.

601
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:18,687
Izaka, the chamberlain's nephew.

602
00:59:35,079 --> 00:59:37,479
They make a good present,

603
00:59:37,682 --> 00:59:40,651
but they're too heavy
to carry to Kikui.

604
00:59:59,838 --> 01:00:01,362
Take them away.

605
01:00:03,775 --> 01:00:05,242
Get up!

606
01:00:12,450 --> 01:00:17,319
We should take more men.
The others will try to rescue these four.

607
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:20,151
We're defenseless
on the road.

608
01:00:21,092 --> 01:00:22,525
Very well.

609
01:00:31,936 --> 01:00:34,302
Bring reinforcements quickly.

610
01:00:36,774 --> 01:00:38,708
It's not safe to go alone.

611
01:00:38,910 --> 01:00:40,400
Take two men with you.

612
01:00:52,390 --> 01:00:55,257
Three's not enough.
I'll go too.

613
01:01:15,647 --> 01:01:17,444
I'm going with you.

614
01:01:35,533 --> 01:01:38,366
It's me! Open up!

615
01:01:40,972 --> 01:01:41,904
What happened?

616
01:01:42,073 --> 01:01:44,803
Those three are already dead.

617
01:01:50,682 --> 01:01:52,377
It must have been them.

618
01:01:57,622 --> 01:02:00,318
I'll go instead.
Where is it?

619
01:02:00,491 --> 01:02:04,222
Nobody knows you there.
I'll go. You take charge here.

620
01:02:59,083 --> 01:03:01,643
We've had enough
of your trouble.

621
01:03:14,132 --> 01:03:15,565
What are you doing?

622
01:03:16,801 --> 01:03:18,894
Can't you tell?

623
01:03:19,103 --> 01:03:21,230
I'm setting them free.

624
01:04:18,896 --> 01:04:21,558
This butchery
is all thanks to you.

625
01:04:35,580 --> 01:04:37,275
Tie me up!

626
01:05:07,745 --> 01:05:12,273
We're too late. Ten men stay
to clean up. The rest hurry back.

627
01:05:39,143 --> 01:05:40,633
What's this mess?

628
01:05:40,812 --> 01:05:42,541
I expected more from you.

629
01:05:42,914 --> 01:05:44,711
I'm deeply ashamed.

630
01:05:45,383 --> 01:05:50,150
But when you're that outnumbered,
you can only surrender.

631
01:05:52,490 --> 01:05:57,484
I'm not bound by duty
to die like these guys here.

632
01:05:58,596 --> 01:06:00,325
This isn't good.

633
01:06:01,933 --> 01:06:05,960
I can't recommend you
after a disgrace like this.

634
01:06:07,271 --> 01:06:08,704
I'm sorry.

635
01:06:10,408 --> 01:06:13,673
But I remember
that greenhorn's face.

636
01:06:14,445 --> 01:06:16,970
I'll redeem myself
by bringing him to you.

637
01:06:26,023 --> 01:06:28,491
You're all so damned clever!

638
01:06:28,926 --> 01:06:31,895
You ruined my well-laid plan.

639
01:06:32,096 --> 01:06:36,089
And you still don't know
where Kikui's huge army went.

640
01:06:39,203 --> 01:06:41,637
What a life of leisure!

641
01:06:41,839 --> 01:06:45,832
At this rate,
by the time you find Mutsuta,

642
01:06:46,077 --> 01:06:49,877
I'll be a silver-haired
70-year-old.

643
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,714
How beautiful!

644
01:07:00,892 --> 01:07:05,886
This water comes
from the Camellia Mansion next door.

645
01:07:06,063 --> 01:07:08,395
How do you know that?

646
01:07:08,666 --> 01:07:13,262
I once heard Terada tell lori,

647
01:07:14,572 --> 01:07:18,872
"They say stealing another's water
is wrong even if you're parched,

648
01:07:19,143 --> 01:07:23,705
but I'm drinking the water
of that blackguard Kurofuji."

649
01:07:30,254 --> 01:07:31,482
Look.

650
01:07:36,327 --> 01:07:40,024
Iori's name is on that paper.

651
01:07:40,197 --> 01:07:43,166
I see Terada's name too.

652
01:07:43,334 --> 01:07:47,100
What's that red blot?

653
01:07:48,773 --> 01:07:51,970
- It's signed in blood!
- Blood?

654
01:07:53,077 --> 01:07:54,635
Iori!

655
01:07:58,349 --> 01:08:00,374
Not so loud!
Kurofuji is next door.

656
01:08:00,551 --> 01:08:04,112
But you should see this.
Shouldn't he, Mother?

657
01:08:04,288 --> 01:08:06,279
What is that?

658
01:08:25,776 --> 01:08:30,110
So Uncle tore up our petition,
then placed it in his sleeve.

659
01:08:31,816 --> 01:08:35,047
He wore the same kimono
when Kikui abducted him

660
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,616
as when I met
with him earlier that day.

661
01:08:39,957 --> 01:08:41,390
Right?

662
01:08:44,895 --> 01:08:46,453
That means -

663
01:08:47,231 --> 01:08:49,859
Look what I found in the stream!

664
01:08:50,034 --> 01:08:52,502
Pieces of the torn petition.

665
01:08:53,904 --> 01:08:56,634
No doubt about it.

666
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,866
Uncle is next door.

667
01:08:59,844 --> 01:09:05,009
In order to protect us,
fools that we are,

668
01:09:06,951 --> 01:09:09,818
he seized a moment
when his captors weren't looking

669
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,888
and threw these in the stream.

670
01:09:18,629 --> 01:09:21,120
Aren't you tired
of being stupid yet?

671
01:09:22,033 --> 01:09:26,197
You want to attack?
That's what they're waiting for.

672
01:09:28,272 --> 01:09:32,868
Don't you get it?
Kikui's men are next door.

673
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:35,535
Take a look
if you doubt me.

674
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:23,023
- He wrote it?
- Finally?

675
01:10:43,047 --> 01:10:44,514
What is this?

676
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:46,813
This isn't a confession!

677
01:10:47,284 --> 01:10:48,751
It's an indictment!

678
01:10:48,919 --> 01:10:52,252
The skunk!
How long will he keep this up?

679
01:10:53,023 --> 01:10:54,251
What now?

680
01:11:06,570 --> 01:11:08,629
There are a great many of them.

681
01:11:17,448 --> 01:11:18,972
What do we do?

682
01:11:19,150 --> 01:11:21,744
They overestimate our number,
which is worse.

683
01:11:21,919 --> 01:11:23,546
That's it!

684
01:11:23,921 --> 01:11:28,119
I'll go tell them
I know where you are.

685
01:11:30,427 --> 01:11:35,160
They overestimate
the size of your group.

686
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,994
If I say an army
has assembled somewhere,

687
01:11:40,571 --> 01:11:43,165
Kikui will send his men there.

688
01:11:43,807 --> 01:11:46,173
The house will be empty,

689
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,304
leaving you free to raid it.

690
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:54,483
Where shall I say you are?

691
01:11:54,752 --> 01:11:58,620
Another shrine would be boring.
How about a temple?

692
01:11:59,924 --> 01:12:05,226
I'll say I was snoozing on the second floor
of the gate and heard you swarm in.

693
01:12:05,462 --> 01:12:08,260
Not a bad plan, eh?
You know a good temple?

694
01:12:10,434 --> 01:12:15,167
Far enough away to give you time
to rescue the chamberlain.

695
01:12:16,307 --> 01:12:20,539
Komyo Temple.
A good distance, and very secluded.

696
01:12:20,711 --> 01:12:23,441
Good. Komyo Temple it is.

697
01:12:24,648 --> 01:12:26,206
But listen.

698
01:12:26,684 --> 01:12:31,348
Even after Kikui's men leave,
wait for my signal.

699
01:12:32,022 --> 01:12:35,048
Once you're inside,
rescue him quickly.

700
01:12:35,226 --> 01:12:37,592
They're still willing to kill him
as a last recourse.

701
01:12:49,740 --> 01:12:51,469
There's no other way.

702
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:59,212
We must turn
to our last recourse.

703
01:13:01,719 --> 01:13:03,346
Understand?

704
01:13:04,121 --> 01:13:08,854
Wait until I signal
that it's safe to rescue him.

705
01:13:09,059 --> 01:13:10,822
We understand.
What's the signal?

706
01:13:10,995 --> 01:13:13,759
Wait until I've set
the house ablaze.

707
01:13:13,931 --> 01:13:16,923
Goodness, no!
That's too reckless.

708
01:13:19,703 --> 01:13:21,728
I have an idea.

709
01:13:23,574 --> 01:13:27,010
Send something
down the stream.

710
01:13:27,578 --> 01:13:32,242
We'll watch the stream
and see your signal for sure.

711
01:13:32,783 --> 01:13:37,743
My dear,
that's a marvelous idea.

712
01:13:38,188 --> 01:13:40,952
Such a beautifully gentle approach.

713
01:13:41,358 --> 01:13:45,419
Mother, since it's
from Camellia Mansion,

714
01:13:45,929 --> 01:13:48,397
wouldn't camellias be nice?

715
01:13:49,333 --> 01:13:52,234
Red camellias...

716
01:13:52,436 --> 01:13:54,700
how lovely that would be.

717
01:13:55,039 --> 01:13:59,874
I rather prefer white myself.

718
01:14:01,478 --> 01:14:04,914
What's the difference?
It's all camellias.

719
01:14:05,082 --> 01:14:07,312
But sometimes
they fall in naturally.

720
01:14:07,484 --> 01:14:09,782
I'll dump in a pile of 'em.

721
01:14:30,808 --> 01:14:32,332
Open up!

722
01:14:32,743 --> 01:14:34,608
I want to see Muroto.

723
01:14:46,223 --> 01:14:47,349
Bad news!

724
01:14:47,524 --> 01:14:51,790
Komyo Temple's gate
doesn't have a second story!

725
01:14:51,962 --> 01:14:55,056
They'll see
right through his story!

726
01:15:05,976 --> 01:15:08,342
How did you know I was here?

727
01:15:10,347 --> 01:15:13,407
I heard the superintendent's men
were here.

728
01:15:13,584 --> 01:15:15,779
I assumed you would be too.

729
01:15:19,523 --> 01:15:21,388
What do you want?

730
01:15:23,727 --> 01:15:25,627
I brought you a nice gift.

731
01:15:28,866 --> 01:15:32,267
I was asleep on the second floor
of the gate at Komyo Temple...

732
01:15:43,781 --> 01:15:47,114
- What'll we do?
- It's too late.

733
01:15:47,284 --> 01:15:50,117
We didn't catch
the mistake right off.

734
01:15:52,222 --> 01:15:54,122
Maybe they won't either.

735
01:15:55,826 --> 01:15:57,953
I'll have a look.

736
01:16:04,835 --> 01:16:06,803
Wait in here for now.

737
01:17:03,994 --> 01:17:07,430
- What? 130 men at Komyo Temple?
- So he says.

738
01:17:07,631 --> 01:17:13,035
- Who's this ronin asleep above the gate?
- Never mind that now.

739
01:17:13,237 --> 01:17:16,695
Kikui, we can't afford
another failure.

740
01:17:18,141 --> 01:17:20,871
Very well.
I'll go myself this time.

741
01:17:36,627 --> 01:17:39,653
We're going to Komyo Temple.
You're coming with us.

742
01:17:43,400 --> 01:17:46,995
Actually, I haven't
eaten since yesterday.

743
01:17:47,638 --> 01:17:49,663
I can't fight
on an empty stomach.

744
01:17:50,240 --> 01:17:51,901
Give me something to eat.

745
01:17:52,776 --> 01:17:55,336
I'll catch up with you
after I've eaten.

746
01:18:29,012 --> 01:18:31,947
It worked!
The men have left!

747
01:18:32,115 --> 01:18:34,083
- You sure?
- Even Kikui was on his horse.

748
01:18:34,251 --> 01:18:36,811
- Kikui left too?
- He was livid!

749
01:19:29,539 --> 01:19:31,336
Thank you for your patience.

750
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:35,103
I want to eat alone.
Scram. It's cramped in here.

751
01:20:35,539 --> 01:20:37,404
What are you doing?

752
01:20:40,844 --> 01:20:43,369
I like camellias.

753
01:20:45,615 --> 01:20:47,242
Enough games!

754
01:20:58,595 --> 01:21:00,085
Wait a minute!

755
01:21:00,297 --> 01:21:03,994
The gate at Komyo Temple -
It's all a lie!

756
01:21:19,049 --> 01:21:21,313
Is anybody here?

757
01:21:26,523 --> 01:21:29,515
It's a trap! That temple gate
has no second floor!

758
01:21:29,693 --> 01:21:31,957
Call your men back!
It's a trap!

759
01:21:32,162 --> 01:21:35,461
There's blood on your sword,
and it's fresh.

760
01:21:35,632 --> 01:21:38,157
You tricked me last night,
you scum.

761
01:21:38,335 --> 01:21:40,895
You can question him later!
Hurry!

762
01:22:06,863 --> 01:22:08,854
You guys are done for.

763
01:22:10,834 --> 01:22:12,665
No, you are.

764
01:22:14,004 --> 01:22:17,405
Poor fools,
you have no idea.

765
01:22:18,441 --> 01:22:21,274
They'll be attacking soon.

766
01:22:21,444 --> 01:22:22,809
Who?

767
01:22:23,180 --> 01:22:26,377
The conspirators, of course.

768
01:22:28,018 --> 01:22:32,455
They're next door,
waiting for my signal.

769
01:22:32,823 --> 01:22:37,556
Without my signal to aborit,
you'll be dead before the army returns.

770
01:22:41,031 --> 01:22:43,693
Take a look
if you don't believe me.

771
01:23:15,832 --> 01:23:19,063
- Still no signal?
- What's taking him so long?

772
01:23:19,269 --> 01:23:22,204
If something's happened to him,
he can't signal.

773
01:23:22,405 --> 01:23:25,306
- What shall we do?
- We can't wait.

774
01:23:26,276 --> 01:23:27,766
Let's attack!
- But...

775
01:23:34,651 --> 01:23:36,312
We can't wait!

776
01:23:36,620 --> 01:23:40,556
Hold on! We always botch things
by ignoring his orders.

777
01:23:40,724 --> 01:23:42,749
Let's wait for the signal.

778
01:23:52,068 --> 01:23:56,437
It's just as he said!
We have to do something quick!

779
01:23:57,474 --> 01:23:59,738
See? You'd better hurry.

780
01:24:00,377 --> 01:24:03,642
But I'll make you an offer.

781
01:24:03,813 --> 01:24:06,680
I'll tell you the signal
for fifty <i>ryo.</i>

782
01:24:07,250 --> 01:24:10,310
Gramps, they were
watching the stream, right?

783
01:24:11,554 --> 01:24:12,543
He's right.

784
01:24:13,390 --> 01:24:16,086
You'd better hurry and send
something down the stream.

785
01:24:18,094 --> 01:24:22,690
He had a lot of red camellias
when he was caught!

786
01:24:24,501 --> 01:24:26,799
What are they the signal for?

787
01:24:27,904 --> 01:24:31,738
- Give me fifty <i>ryo.</i>
- Tell us or we'll kill you!

788
01:24:33,910 --> 01:24:35,002
Okay, 30.

789
01:24:35,612 --> 01:24:38,638
All right, I'll tell you.

790
01:24:39,683 --> 01:24:42,311
Red camellias mean to attack.

791
01:24:42,619 --> 01:24:45,053
White means to aborit.

792
01:24:45,322 --> 01:24:49,850
No signal means I'm in trouble,
and they'll attack.

793
01:24:51,895 --> 01:24:53,590
Don't forget: The white ones!

794
01:24:59,336 --> 01:25:00,997
Hurry!

795
01:25:03,807 --> 01:25:06,367
Don't be stingy! Pile them in!

796
01:25:28,631 --> 01:25:29,996
The signal!

797
01:25:31,234 --> 01:25:32,997
How beautiful!

798
01:25:39,342 --> 01:25:40,866
What a close call!

799
01:25:42,879 --> 01:25:46,747
Thanks for your help, fellas!
The color made no difference.

800
01:25:46,916 --> 01:25:51,285
130 men are on their way!
Flap around all you like!

801
01:25:56,426 --> 01:25:58,917
Don't kill them!

802
01:26:17,714 --> 01:26:20,547
Open up! It's Muroto!

803
01:26:20,750 --> 01:26:22,809
Open the gate!

804
01:27:04,060 --> 01:27:05,789
It's all over.

805
01:27:51,541 --> 01:27:53,099
This one's late.

806
01:27:53,276 --> 01:27:56,768
What was his name again?
- Tsubaki.

807
01:27:57,614 --> 01:28:01,175
Forgetting the name of the man
who saved your life -

808
01:28:01,751 --> 01:28:04,777
that's awful.
- Yes, I know.

809
01:28:06,055 --> 01:28:08,319
Dear, will you ask him
to come in?

810
01:28:09,459 --> 01:28:12,019
Let him know everyone is waiting.

811
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:27,406
Let's get this unpleasant subject
over with now.

812
01:28:28,645 --> 01:28:32,081
The traitors
have been sentenced.

813
01:28:34,984 --> 01:28:40,081
Kikui chose to commit harakiri
soon after the incident.

814
01:28:41,491 --> 01:28:43,220
A regrettable turn of events.

815
01:28:44,961 --> 01:28:47,862
Like the other two, his family name
would have been revoked,

816
01:28:48,631 --> 01:28:50,826
and he and his household banished,

817
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:56,768
but I could have at least
had his life spared.

818
01:29:00,276 --> 01:29:06,044
I had hoped to deal
with the corruption more discreetly.

819
01:29:07,617 --> 01:29:11,849
I'd planned to gather
evidence of their traitorous intent

820
01:29:12,055 --> 01:29:16,014
and force them to retire quietly.

821
01:29:19,028 --> 01:29:20,586
Forgive us.

822
01:29:20,763 --> 01:29:23,823
No need to apologize.

823
01:29:24,867 --> 01:29:28,928
I'm at fault for not inspiring
your confidence.

824
01:29:29,105 --> 01:29:34,975
This long horse face of mine
causes all sorits of trouble.

825
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:40,678
A long time ago,

826
01:29:40,850 --> 01:29:46,482
someone saw me on horseback
and said,

827
01:29:46,990 --> 01:29:50,756
"The rider has a longer face
than the horse!"

828
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:09,878
- He's gone.
- Gone?

829
01:30:10,046 --> 01:30:13,413
I found only this kimono
in his room.

830
01:30:13,583 --> 01:30:16,017
So he left in his rags?

831
01:30:16,953 --> 01:30:20,445
Gentlemen, please break
into groups and find him.

832
01:30:20,657 --> 01:30:21,817
Quickly!

833
01:30:32,168 --> 01:30:37,333
Thank goodness he won't return.

834
01:30:38,241 --> 01:30:40,334
Thank goodness?

835
01:30:40,510 --> 01:30:44,071
He's a great man.

836
01:30:44,280 --> 01:30:50,276
But extraordinary men like him
just make me look bad.

837
01:30:51,621 --> 01:30:53,680
Listen.

838
01:30:54,490 --> 01:31:00,190
He would find it
too confining here.

839
01:31:02,031 --> 01:31:04,226
He wouldn't want
to wear these fine garments

840
01:31:05,268 --> 01:31:09,466
and be a docile servant
of the clan.

841
01:31:18,948 --> 01:31:21,940
- I don't see him anywhere.
- The guard said he went west.

842
01:31:22,118 --> 01:31:24,279
Then it has to be this road.

843
01:31:30,593 --> 01:31:32,720
There he is!

844
01:31:41,804 --> 01:31:44,568
Go home.
I'm not going back.

845
01:31:52,148 --> 01:31:55,208
- You insist on fighting?
- Yes.

846
01:31:55,852 --> 01:32:00,255
I've never been so outraged.
You made a fool of me.

847
01:32:00,957 --> 01:32:02,754
Don't get so angry.

848
01:32:03,292 --> 01:32:04,919
I had to do it.

849
01:32:06,229 --> 01:32:09,357
I knew you were stronger than me,
so I had to -

850
01:32:09,532 --> 01:32:12,433
It's too late for words.
Draw!

851
01:32:14,737 --> 01:32:16,728
I'd rather not.

852
01:32:17,673 --> 01:32:20,107
If I do, one of us must die.

853
01:32:20,309 --> 01:32:22,106
It's not worith it.

854
01:32:23,146 --> 01:32:24,738
It is to me.

855
01:32:25,982 --> 01:32:29,713
Otherwise I can
never be at peace.

856
01:32:32,688 --> 01:32:34,246
Very well.

857
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:39,020
But even if you kill me,

858
01:32:39,195 --> 01:32:41,425
you mustn't kill them.

859
01:32:42,765 --> 01:32:45,097
No matter what,
you all stay out of this!

860
01:33:54,871 --> 01:33:56,202
That was brilliant!

861
01:33:57,940 --> 01:34:00,704
Idiot!
What do you know about anything?

862
01:34:12,054 --> 01:34:13,385
Be careful.

863
01:34:15,291 --> 01:34:17,316
I'm in a bad mood.

864
01:34:30,640 --> 01:34:33,006
He was just like me.

865
01:34:33,543 --> 01:34:38,503
A drawn sword
that wouldn't stay in its sheath.

866
01:34:39,815 --> 01:34:43,876
But you know,
the lady was right.

867
01:34:44,554 --> 01:34:47,785
The best sword
is kept in its sheath.

868
01:34:50,693 --> 01:34:53,161
You'd better stay in yours.

869
01:35:03,739 --> 01:35:06,902
Stop following me
or I'll kill you!

870
01:35:33,102 --> 01:35:34,399
See ya around.

871
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:47,738
THE END
