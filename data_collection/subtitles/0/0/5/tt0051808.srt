7
00:01:52,944 --> 00:01:54,275
Stay away from me!

8
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,411
You stink of dead bodies.

9
00:01:57,149 --> 00:01:59,913
Give it up.
We both smell of corpses.

10
00:02:00,485 --> 00:02:01,975
And it's all your fault!

11
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:11,922
Your smell makes me want to puke.

12
00:02:12,697 --> 00:02:16,133
Though shitworms can't smell shit.

13
00:02:16,935 --> 00:02:18,596
What?

14
00:02:20,705 --> 00:02:23,936
You're a shitworm.
You make me sick.

15
00:02:24,843 --> 00:02:28,836
And you thought we'd make
a fortune at the war.

16
00:02:35,921 --> 00:02:37,320
What's funny, you idiot!

17
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:41,050
It's all funny!

18
00:02:43,962 --> 00:02:46,157
First, we arrived late to the war.

19
00:02:47,999 --> 00:02:50,832
Then they mistook us for
the defeated side

20
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,301
and forced us to bury the dead.

21
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:01,610
We finally escaped and now it's
been 2 days we've only had water.

22
00:03:05,383 --> 00:03:09,979
But the funniest thing is
your foolish cry baby face.

23
00:04:10,148 --> 00:04:11,137
Let's go home.

24
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,948
Don't you have any pride?

25
00:04:16,488 --> 00:04:21,585
We've even been stripped
of the arms we sold our homes for.

26
00:04:22,894 --> 00:04:25,055
We can't go home like this.

27
00:04:25,931 --> 00:04:27,922
Then take it off this dead guy.

28
00:04:29,668 --> 00:04:34,037
Even if I'm desperate,
I'm not a thief.

29
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,765
Do what you want. I'm going!

30
00:04:37,909 --> 00:04:41,538
Go. I'll come home after
I make a buck.

31
00:04:41,913 --> 00:04:43,904
Don't come crying to me then.

32
00:04:44,616 --> 00:04:48,382
Get caught again
and be a gravedigger.

33
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:52,251
Fool! Go away!

34
00:04:53,858 --> 00:04:58,989
It'll be a blessing to see you go,
you shitworm.

35
00:05:24,622 --> 00:05:27,750
We can't cross the border
from this road.

36
00:05:28,693 --> 00:05:30,456
It's a Yamana check station.

37
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:34,159
Not even a mouse could pass
through those barricades.

38
00:05:52,183 --> 00:05:53,582
If they find us, we're dead.

39
00:06:13,138 --> 00:06:13,832
What now?

40
00:06:19,611 --> 00:06:22,808
Unless a fog breaks out,
we can't move.

41
00:06:41,966 --> 00:06:43,456
What does it say up there?

42
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:48,629
It's a notice about a reward
for 10 pieces of gold.

43
00:06:49,908 --> 00:06:50,897
Read it to me.

44
00:06:52,811 --> 00:06:58,181
"Wanted. Princess Yuki of Akizuki."

45
00:06:58,716 --> 00:07:02,618
"A reward of ten ryo
for her capture."

46
00:07:03,455 --> 00:07:08,950
"Three ryo for information
of her whereabouts."

47
00:07:09,094 --> 00:07:13,497
"By order of the Lord of Yamana."

48
00:07:27,679 --> 00:07:29,271
- Move!
- Walk!

49
00:07:55,473 --> 00:07:56,838
I'm not one of them.

50
00:08:12,790 --> 00:08:16,692
I'm thankful for the fog
but I can't see anything.

51
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:23,857
Which way is Hayakawa?

52
00:08:24,335 --> 00:08:26,269
Shut up and follow me!

53
00:08:45,423 --> 00:08:46,355
Who is it?

54
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:18,645
Not grave digging again.

55
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:39,941
Matashichi!

56
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:42,196
Listen!

57
00:10:43,608 --> 00:10:47,669
There is 200 kan of pure gold
hidden in this castle.

58
00:10:48,579 --> 00:10:53,312
Until you find it, you're no
longer men but moles!

59
00:10:55,486 --> 00:10:58,922
So dig! Dig until you drop, moles!

60
00:13:20,865 --> 00:13:23,425
Matashichi, this is hell.

61
00:13:23,568 --> 00:13:25,195
It's the end!

62
00:13:25,503 --> 00:13:27,767
If we're going to die,
let's die together.

63
00:14:18,422 --> 00:14:19,446
That way!

64
00:14:33,638 --> 00:14:35,663
Thieves! Rice thieves!

65
00:14:40,444 --> 00:14:43,743
What shall we do now?

66
00:14:47,818 --> 00:14:49,683
Find the Princess.

67
00:14:50,755 --> 00:14:51,744
The Princess?

68
00:14:52,757 --> 00:14:54,782
The sole survivor
of the Akizuki clan.

69
00:14:55,893 --> 00:14:59,886
I think the reward on her head
is ten ryo.

70
00:15:01,265 --> 00:15:02,289
Ten pieces of gold?

71
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,491
Informers get three.

72
00:15:06,704 --> 00:15:07,864
Three pieces of gold?

73
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:16,343
It's no good. That's only a dream.

74
00:15:17,415 --> 00:15:20,248
If we get greedy and get caught,
we're done for.

75
00:15:23,554 --> 00:15:26,182
I guess we'd better go home.

76
00:15:27,258 --> 00:15:31,024
But how will we cross the border?

77
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:34,922
Bang and we're dead.

78
00:15:41,973 --> 00:15:44,441
Let's eat.

79
00:15:45,409 --> 00:15:47,536
I can't think on an empty stomach.

80
00:15:51,315 --> 00:15:52,805
Not ready.

81
00:15:55,353 --> 00:15:57,753
These don't burn at all.

82
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:27,439
What's this?

83
00:16:42,299 --> 00:16:44,597
Why, it's gold!

84
00:16:49,206 --> 00:16:50,901
You're right! It's gold!

85
00:17:00,818 --> 00:17:03,685
But... a piece of gold...
inside a stick?

86
00:17:06,357 --> 00:17:10,691
I've heard of a rich man hiding
gold in the pillars of his home, but...

87
00:17:12,129 --> 00:17:14,154
What's this? An insignia!

88
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,394
Looks like a crescent.

89
00:17:18,869 --> 00:17:20,632
The crescent is the Akizuki crest!

90
00:17:21,639 --> 00:17:25,439
That's the reserve gold they were
digging for in the castle.

91
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:53,700
You made the fire -
where did you get the wood?

92
00:18:14,325 --> 00:18:16,725
Let's split up and look.

93
00:18:19,663 --> 00:18:22,655
I'll go this way.
You go over there to the marsh.

94
00:19:20,224 --> 00:19:21,191
The same piece!

95
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,992
What are you doing?

96
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,722
One's mine!

97
00:19:26,564 --> 00:19:27,622
I found both!

98
00:19:28,265 --> 00:19:29,357
I found the stick first.

99
00:19:29,867 --> 00:19:30,629
I threw it!

100
00:19:31,168 --> 00:19:32,396
I picked up the gold!

101
00:19:32,803 --> 00:19:35,397
Liar! I'm the one who
noticed it was gold.

102
00:19:39,610 --> 00:19:42,238
- Let's go back.
- Back?

103
00:19:43,747 --> 00:19:45,647
There must be more.

104
00:19:47,585 --> 00:19:50,179
If someone else notices it,
we're screwed.

105
00:19:58,495 --> 00:19:59,723
He's following us.

106
00:20:00,931 --> 00:20:03,126
Watch out. Maybe he's a bandit.

107
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,828
He's not a bandit. He has no sword.

108
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:09,767
You can't be sure.
He may work for one.

109
00:20:28,025 --> 00:20:29,219
He stopped following us.

110
00:20:30,227 --> 00:20:31,421
Let's go back.

111
00:20:34,198 --> 00:20:36,894
No, better be careful.

112
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:42,971
It's late, anyway.
It won't hurt to wait one night.

113
00:20:43,874 --> 00:20:47,002
It's a big job.
Better safe than sorry.

114
00:21:06,530 --> 00:21:11,797
We haven't seen that guy since,
so maybe we didn't need to worry.

115
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:22,410
Probably a lumberjack
or a charcoal maker.

116
00:21:23,881 --> 00:21:26,281
So, let's get this straight now.

117
00:21:29,353 --> 00:21:30,411
What?

118
00:21:32,589 --> 00:21:36,389
Don't play dumb.
How to split up the gold.

119
00:21:38,529 --> 00:21:41,760
Let's be fair and divide it equally.

120
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:46,360
You don't like it?

121
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:53,874
- But I...
- Then it's settled! All right?

122
00:21:59,650 --> 00:22:00,912
Let's sleep.

123
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:06,715
Sleep tight, and let's dream
of mountains of gold.

124
00:22:47,631 --> 00:22:48,359
Hey!

125
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,164
Good eve...

126
00:23:04,381 --> 00:23:05,143
Hey!

127
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:12,921
Cold, isn't it?

128
00:23:45,889 --> 00:23:49,620
What are you doing here
in the mountain?

129
00:23:51,562 --> 00:23:52,790
How about you?

130
00:23:54,565 --> 00:24:01,471
- Us? We intend to cross the border.
- The border?

131
00:24:02,539 --> 00:24:07,067
- We want to go to Hayakawa.
- Hayakawa?

132
00:24:08,745 --> 00:24:10,303
But beyond the mountains
it's Yamana.

133
00:24:14,485 --> 00:24:18,979
Yes... but you see...

134
00:24:22,259 --> 00:24:27,925
to go to Hayakawa...

135
00:24:29,166 --> 00:24:30,531
This is Hayakawa.

136
00:24:32,269 --> 00:24:36,535
And this is Akizuki

137
00:24:37,574 --> 00:24:39,565
where we are now.

138
00:24:40,978 --> 00:24:47,713
This is... Yamana.

139
00:24:50,587 --> 00:24:57,117
We want to go from Akizuki
to Hayakawa.

140
00:24:57,628 --> 00:25:02,793
But the border is guarded
by Yamana soldiers.

141
00:25:04,268 --> 00:25:12,403
So, we'll cross first to Yamana.

142
00:25:12,676 --> 00:25:16,737
And then slip into Hayakawa.

143
00:25:17,414 --> 00:25:18,676
See...

144
00:25:19,416 --> 00:25:24,046
There's no way that survivors
of the Akizuki clan

145
00:25:24,188 --> 00:25:27,123
would go to Yamana,
the enemy territory.

146
00:25:28,325 --> 00:25:34,787
So the border between Akizuki
and Yamana should be open.

147
00:25:36,233 --> 00:25:37,257
That's right.

148
00:25:38,969 --> 00:25:42,336
The Hayakawa-Yamana border
must be

149
00:25:42,472 --> 00:25:48,843
easier to cross than
the Akizuki-Hayakawa border.

150
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:53,982
Anyway, we're just peasants.

151
00:25:54,651 --> 00:25:58,143
Even if anything happened,
we'd still make it.

152
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:13,936
All right. I've made up my mind.

153
00:26:15,572 --> 00:26:19,201
Going through Yamana
is a good idea.

154
00:26:21,411 --> 00:26:25,370
The 200 gold pieces are useless
here, but with three men

155
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:27,881
and three horses,
we can carry it out.

156
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:37,017
200 gold pieces?
What are you talking about?

157
00:26:38,929 --> 00:26:39,987
Be honest.

158
00:27:19,136 --> 00:27:20,603
I've got an eye on that place.

159
00:27:57,641 --> 00:28:03,602
- Don't kick the stones.
- You stop grabbing my leg.

160
00:29:37,007 --> 00:29:37,871
What now?

161
00:29:39,443 --> 00:29:41,070
What is he doing?

162
00:29:47,284 --> 00:29:48,046
He's not here.

163
00:29:51,121 --> 00:29:51,985
Where did he go?

164
00:29:54,658 --> 00:29:56,489
That guy can't be trusted.

165
00:29:59,830 --> 00:30:01,991
What is this place?

166
00:30:15,712 --> 00:30:17,509
It's what they call
a hidden fortress.

167
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:20,749
A hidden fortress?
The Akizuki one.

168
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:25,453
Look. You can see all of Yamana.

169
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:31,127
But...

170
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:35,620
For a fortress,
it's strangely empty.

171
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,334
Someone's here!

172
00:30:47,611 --> 00:30:49,078
What are you doing?

173
00:30:54,584 --> 00:30:57,678
Oh, it's that guy.

174
00:30:59,389 --> 00:31:01,823
Hey. Come down quickly.

175
00:31:23,313 --> 00:31:25,338
How did you get down there?

176
00:31:25,782 --> 00:31:26,874
What are your names?

177
00:31:27,684 --> 00:31:29,151
I'm Matashichi.

178
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:30,887
I'm Tahei.

179
00:31:31,922 --> 00:31:33,446
Matashichi, put the rice down.

180
00:31:34,624 --> 00:31:36,615
Tahei, you put the rice in the pot.

181
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:40,627
Hurry up!

182
00:31:44,367 --> 00:31:50,863
Where's the water? I need
a drink before the food.

183
00:31:51,741 --> 00:31:54,107
Me too. I can't even spit anymore.

184
00:31:56,212 --> 00:31:59,238
Hey. What's your name?

185
00:32:02,485 --> 00:32:07,184
Me? I'm Rokurota Makabe.

186
00:32:08,058 --> 00:32:12,051
Rokurota Makabe?
I've heard that name before.

187
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:16,691
Makabe...

188
00:32:18,501 --> 00:32:19,900
Rokurota Makabe...

189
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:26,336
Get out of here. Rokurota Makabe

190
00:32:26,476 --> 00:32:30,003
is a legendary Akizuki
samurai general.

191
00:32:33,083 --> 00:32:35,381
You take us for fools.

192
00:33:02,178 --> 00:33:03,509
We shouldn't put up with this.

193
00:33:05,215 --> 00:33:11,051
Hey. Stop fooling around. You're no
general, you're just a bully.

194
00:33:12,455 --> 00:33:15,322
What's with the big attitude?

195
00:33:18,328 --> 00:33:23,163
Don't make fun of us. Damn you.

196
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,158
What?

197
00:33:59,936 --> 00:34:01,096
That wasn't very nice.

198
00:34:03,073 --> 00:34:06,600
You could have told us if
there was a secret passageway.

199
00:34:07,711 --> 00:34:10,839
We've been partners
since last night.

200
00:34:11,614 --> 00:34:14,742
Besides, just because you found
this place first,

201
00:34:14,884 --> 00:34:16,749
doesn't mean you're the boss.

202
00:34:25,228 --> 00:34:28,026
Let's decide now how
we're going to divvy up.

203
00:34:28,965 --> 00:34:32,457
Fair and square, we share it
in three equal parts. Deal?

204
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:34,261
Here's the water.

205
00:35:07,403 --> 00:35:08,495
Excellent.

206
00:35:22,152 --> 00:35:27,852
This is some fortress that
they have water like this.

207
00:35:46,009 --> 00:35:49,308
Don't bother.
I already went through there.

208
00:35:50,146 --> 00:35:51,511
Just prepare the rice.

209
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:55,517
Shut up. I can't take it anymore.
You can stuff your orders.

210
00:35:57,053 --> 00:35:58,179
You want to fight?

211
00:35:58,321 --> 00:36:00,186
Don't hold back. Do him in.

212
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,351
Cook the rice.

213
00:36:42,999 --> 00:36:43,966
It's a girl.

214
00:37:04,621 --> 00:37:06,748
Where is she? Who is she?

215
00:37:07,891 --> 00:37:11,588
I don't know. She's really quick
though. She's already gone.

216
00:37:15,832 --> 00:37:19,962
Look. She's mine, OK? I'll kill you
if you go near her.

217
00:37:21,437 --> 00:37:23,371
Cook and then it's work.

218
00:37:27,510 --> 00:37:28,602
What are you doing?

219
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:34,098
Don't touch me, fool!
It's uncomfortable enough.

220
00:38:35,712 --> 00:38:38,738
It's your face that
makes me uncomfortable.

221
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:44,281
Leave my face alone.

222
00:38:47,924 --> 00:38:52,759
I hate the way you blink
all the time.

223
00:38:55,598 --> 00:38:57,190
There you go again.

224
00:39:01,204 --> 00:39:04,833
Shut up. Put your filthy teeth away.

225
00:39:06,776 --> 00:39:11,110
Show them to me once more
and I'll bash them in.

226
00:39:26,029 --> 00:39:31,160
I'm quitting! This is idiotic!
I dig and dig and nothing!

227
00:39:32,735 --> 00:39:34,430
It's his fault.

228
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:44,676
Dammit. Gone again.

229
00:39:50,653 --> 00:39:56,148
He's on his high horse
watching us do all the work.

230
00:39:56,959 --> 00:40:00,861
Right. He's probably running
around looking for that girl.

231
00:40:02,231 --> 00:40:07,692
Maybe he already found a place
and is sleeping with her.

232
00:40:08,337 --> 00:40:13,832
We agreed to split everything in
three. The girl should be the same.

233
00:40:14,610 --> 00:40:17,078
That bully is not just anyone.

234
00:40:17,713 --> 00:40:19,840
I can't figure out what he's up to.

235
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:26,118
He may already have found the 200
pieces of gold and moved them.

236
00:40:29,125 --> 00:40:32,424
That's very likely. I'm sure of it.

237
00:40:36,732 --> 00:40:40,759
That means he's hiding the gold
right now.

238
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,398
So if he's not in this fortress...

239
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:48,001
Look!

240
00:40:48,711 --> 00:40:50,338
That spring is fishy.

241
00:40:52,348 --> 00:40:56,284
Pretending like he's already
checked it out... damn.

242
00:41:58,481 --> 00:42:00,005
Where do you live?

243
00:42:04,587 --> 00:42:06,077
Hey, lady, don't be mad.

244
00:43:39,782 --> 00:43:41,010
What are you doing?

245
00:43:41,150 --> 00:43:45,211
Shut up! I told you I'd kill you
if you touched her!

246
00:43:49,692 --> 00:43:53,025
Wait, boss. It's not fair.

247
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:56,521
Look. The girl dropped this.

248
00:43:58,768 --> 00:44:03,137
Don't go behind our back.
She's worth 10 ryo.

249
00:44:04,273 --> 00:44:06,298
This does not belong
to a country girl.

250
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:10,876
Maybe you think she's the
Akizuki princess.

251
00:44:14,216 --> 00:44:15,342
You're right.

252
00:44:16,585 --> 00:44:18,348
That comb does belong
to Princess Yuki.

253
00:44:19,655 --> 00:44:23,056
But now it belongs to me.
Give it back.

254
00:44:26,562 --> 00:44:28,689
I took it from the Princess
and gave it to her.

255
00:44:29,065 --> 00:44:29,963
What?

256
00:44:30,199 --> 00:44:31,097
I don't lie.

257
00:44:32,902 --> 00:44:34,199
Then where is Princess Yuki?

258
00:44:35,404 --> 00:44:36,996
I captured her and handed her
over to the Yamana authorities.

259
00:44:38,874 --> 00:44:41,536
Careful. I think he's full of crap.

260
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:50,408
Here's the reward of 10 ryo.
Still think it's a lie?

261
00:45:07,570 --> 00:45:09,162
Tell me. Where did Matashichi go?

262
00:45:09,872 --> 00:45:10,861
I don't know.

263
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,469
What are you plotting? Tell me!

264
00:45:16,345 --> 00:45:18,108
To... to the town.

265
00:45:18,447 --> 00:45:19,744
To do what?

266
00:45:21,183 --> 00:45:23,447
He went to report.

267
00:45:23,753 --> 00:45:25,152
Report who?

268
00:45:25,488 --> 00:45:29,049
- The princess, of course.
- The princess?

269
00:45:36,632 --> 00:45:40,033
We're not as stupid as you think.

270
00:45:41,370 --> 00:45:45,329
You thought you had fooled us
but we're not that gullible.

271
00:45:47,343 --> 00:45:48,742
I know your game.

272
00:45:49,712 --> 00:45:57,812
Your reward money is just
a part of the hidden gold.

273
00:45:59,755 --> 00:46:02,417
You're greedy on top of it.

274
00:46:02,825 --> 00:46:06,124
You want to capture
the princess yourself

275
00:46:06,262 --> 00:46:08,594
so you can have all the reward.

276
00:46:09,198 --> 00:46:11,063
It won't go so smoothly.

277
00:46:12,968 --> 00:46:14,731
I made a mistake
by relying on scum.

278
00:46:16,272 --> 00:46:18,297
You think you're better, scum?

279
00:46:24,647 --> 00:46:28,310
Matashichi, did you see
the officers?

280
00:46:28,617 --> 00:46:31,882
Fool. Do you think
I'd be back so soon?

281
00:46:33,022 --> 00:46:37,049
It's the talk of town already.
The princess was captured

282
00:46:37,193 --> 00:46:40,924
a while back and
she was beheaded yesterday.

283
00:47:03,052 --> 00:47:06,613
Boss, we're sorry we doubted you.

284
00:48:36,612 --> 00:48:37,704
It's Rokurota Makabe.

285
00:48:38,314 --> 00:48:39,303
Enter.

286
00:48:53,128 --> 00:48:53,890
Any news?

287
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:58,196
Kofuyu served her duty.

288
00:49:03,706 --> 00:49:06,004
The enemy will relax
their guard now.

289
00:49:07,543 --> 00:49:09,807
Now is our chance to escape.

290
00:49:11,313 --> 00:49:14,407
What happened to Kofuyu?

291
00:49:16,218 --> 00:49:20,052
As a dutiful servant, my sister went
in place of your Highness.

292
00:49:21,890 --> 00:49:25,326
This assures the safety
of your Highness.

293
00:49:26,195 --> 00:49:27,219
Rokurota!

294
00:49:28,497 --> 00:49:28,986
Fool!

295
00:49:29,131 --> 00:49:31,429
What are you saying your Highness?

296
00:49:32,668 --> 00:49:38,937
Kofuyu was 16... I am 16. What
difference is there in our souls?

297
00:49:39,708 --> 00:49:45,977
It is our duty as servants.
Kofuyu was honored...

298
00:49:46,548 --> 00:49:52,145
Lies! If I were Kofuyu,
I would curse this Princess.

299
00:49:52,287 --> 00:49:57,657
Your words are too harsh.
Rokurota has no leg to stand on.

300
00:49:58,227 --> 00:49:59,057
Be quiet!

301
00:50:00,996 --> 00:50:05,365
I don't even want to see your face!

302
00:50:06,769 --> 00:50:10,671
Your nobility that doesn't
even shed a tear

303
00:50:10,806 --> 00:50:12,239
when you've killed your sister.

304
00:50:17,379 --> 00:50:18,744
I hate it!

305
00:50:20,015 --> 00:50:20,913
I hate it!

306
00:50:30,793 --> 00:50:36,163
I don't know what to do with her
Highness. It's the Lord's fault.

307
00:50:37,066 --> 00:50:39,694
Even if he was lacking an heir,

308
00:50:39,835 --> 00:50:43,931
it was cruel to raise her Highness
like a boy.

309
00:50:44,673 --> 00:50:48,200
Say right and she'll go left,
say left and she'll go right.

310
00:50:49,178 --> 00:50:56,050
And though she is a girl,
she has never shown me a tear.

311
00:50:56,852 --> 00:50:58,649
The same
with her present behavior.

312
00:51:00,022 --> 00:51:04,618
Insensitive to your pain of having
sacrificed your sister, she...

313
00:51:05,194 --> 00:51:09,358
She herself does not shed a tear,
but she still criticizes you.

314
00:51:09,965 --> 00:51:11,796
It's too much.

315
00:51:13,836 --> 00:51:15,599
Her Highness is the real sacrifice.

316
00:51:17,172 --> 00:51:20,835
Her suffering of having to rebuild
the Akizuki clan...

317
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:11,658
The Yamana's are here!

318
00:52:12,928 --> 00:52:15,021
There are horses at the spring.

319
00:53:12,187 --> 00:53:17,454
This is good, to fool the Yamana's
by going through enemy lines.

320
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:22,488
This was the peasants' idea.

321
00:53:23,732 --> 00:53:27,691
Depending on their answers,
I was ready to kill them.

322
00:53:27,836 --> 00:53:31,966
But hearing their plan to go
through Yamana to Hayakawa,

323
00:53:32,107 --> 00:53:33,267
I was stunned.

324
00:53:33,408 --> 00:53:35,842
Sometimes even moss can be smart...

325
00:53:40,415 --> 00:53:43,475
How long can we rely on them?

326
00:53:44,419 --> 00:53:46,216
We can rely on their greed.

327
00:53:46,955 --> 00:53:49,617
Make them carry gold and
they'll put up with anything.

328
00:53:51,393 --> 00:53:53,452
That takes care of the gold.

329
00:53:55,464 --> 00:54:00,959
But we cannot take a chance
with the Princess.

330
00:54:02,004 --> 00:54:05,405
But staying here is not safe either.

331
00:54:06,975 --> 00:54:09,910
This hidden fortress will soon
be discovered by the Yamana's too.

332
00:54:10,812 --> 00:54:15,442
And our deal with Lord Hayakawa
may not last either.

333
00:54:16,952 --> 00:54:17,976
Understood.

334
00:54:19,388 --> 00:54:23,415
But what shall we do
with the Princess?

335
00:54:29,131 --> 00:54:31,929
We can disguise her looks,
but not her class.

336
00:54:34,336 --> 00:54:36,804
And her speech...

337
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:42,074
Her Highness
will have to be a mute.

338
00:54:42,277 --> 00:54:46,907
A mute... isn't there any other way?

339
00:54:48,317 --> 00:54:49,306
There isn't.

340
00:54:50,252 --> 00:54:54,154
I don't know if the Princess
would agree.

341
00:54:59,494 --> 00:55:00,927
Leave it to me.

342
00:55:05,100 --> 00:55:06,362
I hadn't ridden in a long time.

343
00:55:07,336 --> 00:55:11,033
She runs fast. She's too good
to be a packhorse.

344
00:55:11,807 --> 00:55:14,674
Just in case you need to ride.

345
00:55:15,744 --> 00:55:18,975
So we finally pass
through enemy lines.

346
00:55:21,283 --> 00:55:27,654
- Speaking of which, could you play mute?
- Mute?

347
00:55:29,057 --> 00:55:32,288
I'm sure you couldn't do it.

348
00:55:35,697 --> 00:55:40,566
To go through Yamana, my greatest
concern is your speech.

349
00:55:41,370 --> 00:55:45,067
We were discussing
you could be a mute...

350
00:55:46,008 --> 00:55:47,737
But I think it's impossible.

351
00:55:50,078 --> 00:55:54,742
I was captured once and
had to pretend to be a mute.

352
00:55:55,684 --> 00:55:58,244
It was agony.

353
00:55:59,054 --> 00:56:01,614
Your Highness couldn't take it.

354
00:56:11,967 --> 00:56:13,127
I'm not biting.

355
00:56:15,537 --> 00:56:18,199
When you say right, I say left.

356
00:56:20,709 --> 00:56:24,406
I'm a handful.

357
00:56:25,380 --> 00:56:30,408
Let me use reverse psychology.

358
00:56:30,819 --> 00:56:31,615
Princess.

359
00:56:32,220 --> 00:56:33,084
All right.

360
00:56:39,895 --> 00:56:45,333
This once I will let you fool me.
Otherwise your plan will be foiled.

361
00:56:50,038 --> 00:56:52,973
Your noble face again.

362
00:56:54,042 --> 00:56:57,011
If you need anything, tell me now.

363
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:01,472
Once I'm a mute,
I'm not talking until Hayakawa.

364
00:57:20,902 --> 00:57:21,926
We have to tell him.

365
00:57:22,070 --> 00:57:24,197
The bully? Never mind him.

366
00:57:31,146 --> 00:57:33,774
Idiot, shut up. We'll get caught.

367
00:57:57,239 --> 00:57:58,171
Where are you going?

368
00:57:59,074 --> 00:58:03,443
Boss, run! The Yamana soldiers
have found us.

369
00:58:03,979 --> 00:58:07,779
There were horses by the spring.

370
00:58:12,554 --> 00:58:15,648
Idiots. I stole those.

371
00:58:18,360 --> 00:58:21,022
We can't carry 200 pieces
of gold without them.

372
00:58:21,563 --> 00:58:22,291
Gold?

373
00:58:24,666 --> 00:58:25,928
We'll climb down today.

374
00:58:27,335 --> 00:58:29,303
Where is the gold?

375
00:58:43,251 --> 00:58:46,448
Hey. Where is the gold?

376
00:58:47,489 --> 00:58:50,390
Don't hold out on us. Come on.

377
00:58:59,467 --> 00:59:00,365
I knew it!

378
00:59:03,772 --> 00:59:05,740
Don't fool around with us.

379
00:59:06,174 --> 00:59:08,768
You said you had already gone
through there.

380
00:59:09,211 --> 00:59:11,645
Why did you make us dig
at the fortress?

381
00:59:12,747 --> 00:59:13,975
I was testing you.

382
00:59:15,550 --> 00:59:19,384
We'll need a lot of backbone
on the road. You did well.

383
00:59:20,188 --> 00:59:23,419
Lift the gold out of the water
and onto the horses.

384
00:59:24,025 --> 00:59:25,856
The three of us will carry the rest.

385
00:59:38,106 --> 00:59:39,368
Gold!

386
00:59:40,408 --> 00:59:43,241
Leave the gold in the wood.

387
01:00:28,590 --> 01:00:29,579
Dammit.

388
01:00:36,398 --> 01:00:37,592
Where did you hide this?

389
01:00:38,933 --> 01:00:41,595
You're so suspicious.
That's just firewood.

390
01:00:45,807 --> 01:00:50,835
It's a bad idea to take the girl.
She'll slow us down.

391
01:00:54,082 --> 01:00:56,141
What if she blabs...

392
01:00:57,352 --> 01:01:00,014
- She's mute. Don't worry.
- Mute?

393
01:02:25,540 --> 01:02:28,100
This will be an easy border
to cross.

394
01:02:29,244 --> 01:02:30,040
Wait.

395
01:02:33,448 --> 01:02:34,472
Better be cautious.

396
01:02:41,956 --> 01:02:43,924
Don't move 'til I come back.

397
01:02:52,667 --> 01:02:55,966
If we want to get rid of him,
now's our chance.

398
01:03:02,744 --> 01:03:04,143
Don't worry. She's mute.

399
01:03:04,712 --> 01:03:06,145
She's mute but she can hear.

400
01:03:06,648 --> 01:03:11,483
Stupid. A mute can't speak
because she's deaf.

401
01:03:16,090 --> 01:03:17,421
This is where we have to think.

402
01:03:18,259 --> 01:03:22,787
He's sly so we can't trust him even
if we cross into Hayakawa.

403
01:03:23,832 --> 01:03:25,026
He'll cheat us.

404
01:03:26,868 --> 01:03:28,267
Let's run away.

405
01:03:29,137 --> 01:03:31,037
What about his load?

406
01:03:33,074 --> 01:03:37,909
We can't carry it.
We'll take his horse.

407
01:03:43,918 --> 01:03:46,352
There's no time to argue.

408
01:03:47,589 --> 01:03:50,217
Let's tell her we're taking
the horses for a drink.

409
01:04:00,502 --> 01:04:02,129
Fool. They're not drinking sake.

410
01:06:02,857 --> 01:06:04,552
What are you doing?

411
01:06:42,397 --> 01:06:43,523
Where are the horses?

412
01:06:54,509 --> 01:06:55,635
What shall we do?

413
01:07:31,679 --> 01:07:32,236
Princess!

414
01:07:34,282 --> 01:07:37,843
It's frustrating to be a mute.
All I can do is watch.

415
01:07:38,352 --> 01:07:38,841
The two of them?

416
01:07:39,620 --> 01:07:43,716
Out of greed, they took the horses.

417
01:07:44,659 --> 01:07:47,924
Then the enemy spotted them.
Fine allies.

418
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:07,304
You!

419
01:08:13,287 --> 01:08:16,256
We can't cross that river.

420
01:08:17,225 --> 01:08:19,284
There is a firing squad
on the other side.

421
01:08:25,166 --> 01:08:28,829
I know your game.
Take the gold and get lost.

422
01:09:16,050 --> 01:09:17,608
He's gone.

423
01:09:23,157 --> 01:09:26,126
Boss!

424
01:09:28,963 --> 01:09:31,454
There he is.

425
01:09:33,401 --> 01:09:36,893
Boss, the other side is lined
with Yamana soldiers.

426
01:09:37,338 --> 01:09:39,101
What would you do?

427
01:09:40,608 --> 01:09:41,540
What do I care?

428
01:09:43,311 --> 01:09:45,506
What are you doing?

429
01:09:46,214 --> 01:09:47,875
Wait and see at the fortress?

430
01:09:48,683 --> 01:09:50,378
Shut up. Go away.

431
01:09:51,752 --> 01:09:53,686
Please, take us with you.

432
01:09:54,155 --> 01:09:57,147
We promise to behave.

433
01:10:09,637 --> 01:10:10,501
What's that?

434
01:10:24,552 --> 01:10:26,611
The Yamana's found it!

435
01:10:30,358 --> 01:10:32,451
What will we do?

436
01:10:55,316 --> 01:10:56,180
We're leaving.

437
01:10:57,351 --> 01:10:58,113
Which way?

438
01:10:58,986 --> 01:10:59,918
Straight ahead.

439
01:11:00,454 --> 01:11:01,318
You're joking!

440
01:11:04,859 --> 01:11:06,520
Leave it to me. I have a plan.

441
01:11:41,796 --> 01:11:42,888
Your pass?

442
01:11:44,899 --> 01:11:45,831
Wait!

443
01:11:50,404 --> 01:11:51,268
Boss.

444
01:11:56,610 --> 01:11:57,338
Next!

445
01:12:01,983 --> 01:12:03,814
Your pass. What's your problem?

446
01:12:05,553 --> 01:12:06,577
I picked up something.

447
01:12:07,021 --> 01:12:09,285
What? It's just a piece of wood.

448
01:12:10,257 --> 01:12:12,623
I found it at Mt. Suribachi.

449
01:12:21,469 --> 01:12:23,096
He found this.

450
01:12:30,344 --> 01:12:31,572
The Akizuki crest!

451
01:12:33,280 --> 01:12:35,145
You really found it
at Mt. Suribachi?

452
01:12:36,951 --> 01:12:39,647
Bring me my horse!

453
01:12:40,421 --> 01:12:42,116
That gold is mine. Give it back.

454
01:12:42,623 --> 01:12:43,521
No.

455
01:12:44,625 --> 01:12:46,786
Give me the gold or a reward.

456
01:12:48,662 --> 01:12:49,993
Shut up. Get lost.

457
01:12:51,766 --> 01:12:53,563
Give me a reward. I won't move!

458
01:13:05,913 --> 01:13:09,246
A reward! Give me a reward!

459
01:13:41,015 --> 01:13:42,073
Greedy.

460
01:14:04,772 --> 01:14:08,765
Two or three loaded horses,
several men and a girl.

461
01:14:09,243 --> 01:14:11,438
If you see such a group,
arrest them immediately.

462
01:14:11,846 --> 01:14:15,646
There are signs that Princess
Yuki's party has been here.

463
01:14:16,417 --> 01:14:19,682
But she was beheaded...

464
01:14:20,154 --> 01:14:22,748
Using a double has been
done before.

465
01:14:23,591 --> 01:14:26,355
You also saw the smoke rise
on the mountain across.

466
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,193
That was Akizuki's hidden fortress.

467
01:14:28,929 --> 01:14:34,367
It was guarded by an old soldier
and two others.

468
01:14:34,602 --> 01:14:36,092
They could have escaped. Instead
they burned the fortress

469
01:14:36,270 --> 01:14:38,636
and fought 'til their end.

470
01:14:38,772 --> 01:14:43,800
It appears they wanted to signal
and gain time for others to escape.

471
01:14:45,312 --> 01:14:49,908
The Princess and a few men
escaped with the gold for sure.

472
01:14:50,351 --> 01:14:52,876
There are traces on the road.

473
01:14:53,654 --> 01:14:58,091
Don't slack. Catch them
and you will be rewarded.

474
01:15:40,367 --> 01:15:41,493
Are you ok, boss?

475
01:15:42,670 --> 01:15:44,900
Let's take a back road.

476
01:15:45,439 --> 01:15:49,136
- Stop sneaking around. It invites suspicion.
- But...

477
01:16:42,896 --> 01:16:43,760
What are you doing?

478
01:16:44,665 --> 01:16:45,927
We're staying here tonight.

479
01:16:47,601 --> 01:16:48,465
Here?

480
01:16:51,138 --> 01:16:54,130
You've got to be kidding me.
Let's hurry through the night.

481
01:16:58,412 --> 01:17:00,437
It's a long way. Let's not push it.

482
01:17:00,748 --> 01:17:02,841
Then let's camp out.

483
01:17:03,984 --> 01:17:07,977
Hide a stone among stones
and a man among men.

484
01:17:22,036 --> 01:17:24,664
Where will we hide the gold?

485
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:27,234
Leave it out in the open.

486
01:18:04,111 --> 01:18:08,912
You're so slow. Get a clue
and bring some water.

487
01:18:19,927 --> 01:18:24,125
Always crying,
but you refuse to take johns.

488
01:18:24,765 --> 01:18:27,325
You were a lousy deal.

489
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:29,001
Where did you get her?

490
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:33,802
In Akizuki. Lose a war
and plenty of women go on sale.

491
01:18:34,108 --> 01:18:35,040
How much?

492
01:18:35,342 --> 01:18:37,469
Five silver pieces. Want her?

493
01:18:37,711 --> 01:18:40,646
Idiot. I'm not a dog like you.

494
01:18:41,815 --> 01:18:43,442
- You bluff.
- No, sorry.

495
01:18:45,419 --> 01:18:46,545
Now, look here.

496
01:18:53,494 --> 01:18:54,222
Look.

497
01:18:54,661 --> 01:19:01,590
Average looking, but excellent
body. How about it?

498
01:19:02,703 --> 01:19:05,536
For one silver piece,
she's yours for the night.

499
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:10,805
What's the use of buying a woman
who won't take customers?

500
01:19:18,118 --> 01:19:18,948
How much is she?

501
01:19:21,054 --> 01:19:24,251
She's a looker!

502
01:19:24,658 --> 01:19:26,558
She's not one of yours?

503
01:19:33,734 --> 01:19:36,294
I'll buy her.
Who does she belong to?

504
01:19:38,505 --> 01:19:39,870
Whose girl is she?

505
01:19:40,474 --> 01:19:44,968
I'll buy her! I'll buy her
for a piece of gold!

506
01:19:47,781 --> 01:19:48,839
Enough!

507
01:19:50,284 --> 01:19:52,650
- She's a mute.
- Mute?

508
01:20:02,396 --> 01:20:05,058
That's too bad. I'll pass.

509
01:20:26,787 --> 01:20:28,448
Who's the owner
of the horse outside?

510
01:20:35,796 --> 01:20:36,728
Is it yours?

511
01:20:37,998 --> 01:20:39,727
Do you want to sell her to me?

512
01:20:40,601 --> 01:20:43,195
I'll give you whatever you want.

513
01:20:43,537 --> 01:20:44,765
But my load...

514
01:20:45,172 --> 01:20:53,136
She's too good for a packhorse. 5
silver pieces. You can buy 5 horses.

515
01:21:03,290 --> 01:21:05,485
Boss. What shall we do?

516
01:21:09,730 --> 01:21:11,425
Two horses are not enough
for everything.

517
01:21:14,334 --> 01:21:17,497
It's hard to find another one.

518
01:21:33,887 --> 01:21:35,013
This sucks.

519
01:21:35,255 --> 01:21:36,517
There is no time for girls.

520
01:21:42,829 --> 01:21:45,798
Buy that girl back.

521
01:21:46,633 --> 01:21:47,327
I cannot.

522
01:21:48,535 --> 01:21:51,333
Why not? I am
the Princess of Akizuki.

523
01:21:52,239 --> 01:21:54,366
I can't bear to see one
of our own in trouble.

524
01:21:55,008 --> 01:21:57,499
No, you're in trouble...

525
01:21:58,579 --> 01:22:00,945
Your kindness will harm you.

526
01:22:02,983 --> 01:22:08,285
Whatever. Buy her back.

527
01:22:08,956 --> 01:22:14,258
- No.
- You cannot make my heart mute too!

528
01:22:20,901 --> 01:22:22,493
A cart was a bad idea.

529
01:22:23,203 --> 01:22:25,262
We're the horses now.

530
01:22:26,206 --> 01:22:28,731
And we've even taken in that girl.

531
01:22:45,025 --> 01:22:47,550
Stop following us. Go away.

532
01:22:49,296 --> 01:22:50,957
Go back to Akizuki.

533
01:23:02,309 --> 01:23:03,742
Don't stop. Continue.

534
01:23:17,290 --> 01:23:22,250
Have you seen four people,
three horses and a girl?

535
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:25,356
If you do, report them immediately.

536
01:23:35,142 --> 01:23:39,238
It went well. We're lucky.

537
01:23:47,821 --> 01:23:51,450
Who said a cart was a bad idea?

538
01:23:52,259 --> 01:23:55,490
You were grumbling about the girl.

539
01:23:58,198 --> 01:24:03,226
But those men are stupid.
Why not check the wood?

540
01:24:12,713 --> 01:24:14,408
What shall we do now?

541
01:24:20,854 --> 01:24:21,684
Be calm!

542
01:24:37,904 --> 01:24:38,734
Put it down.

543
01:24:47,547 --> 01:24:48,536
Report them!

544
01:24:53,987 --> 01:24:55,579
Run! Wait on the hill!

545
01:26:10,125 --> 01:26:13,288
Why, if it isn't Rokurota Makabe!

546
01:26:17,866 --> 01:26:19,265
Hey, Hyoe Tadokoro!

547
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:25,635
Stand aside!
You're no match for him!

548
01:26:28,844 --> 01:26:29,776
A rare meeting.

549
01:26:31,180 --> 01:26:35,276
I regret not meeting you on the
battlefields this time around.

550
01:26:36,585 --> 01:26:38,052
I regret it, too.

551
01:26:45,861 --> 01:26:46,793
How about a duel?

552
01:26:47,429 --> 01:26:48,327
With pleasure!

553
01:26:52,067 --> 01:26:54,729
With what? A spear?

554
01:26:56,972 --> 01:26:57,996
Sounds good.

555
01:26:58,941 --> 01:27:00,909
All of them are inferior,
but choose one.

556
01:34:03,999 --> 01:34:04,829
I lost!

557
01:34:13,775 --> 01:34:14,935
Wait!

558
01:34:28,356 --> 01:34:29,618
We'll meet again.

559
01:34:34,296 --> 01:34:35,228
Rokurota!

560
01:35:18,573 --> 01:35:21,440
- Firewood?
- What about firewood?

561
01:35:21,576 --> 01:35:23,840
Apparently gold is hidden
in the wood.

562
01:35:24,479 --> 01:35:26,913
They're hiding here with all that.

563
01:35:27,616 --> 01:35:30,551
Four of them.
One girl with three men.

564
01:35:31,253 --> 01:35:33,414
She's Princess Yuki from Akizuki.

565
01:35:34,723 --> 01:35:37,590
The reward is 200 pieces
of gold for her.

566
01:35:37,959 --> 01:35:40,120
Five pieces just for information.

567
01:35:42,364 --> 01:35:45,458
Don't jump the gun.
It won't be easy.

568
01:35:46,067 --> 01:35:50,128
A strong general, Rokurota Makabe,
is with her.

569
01:36:17,465 --> 01:36:18,523
It's cold!

570
01:36:21,036 --> 01:36:22,765
It's been three days now.

571
01:36:24,639 --> 01:36:28,166
- More rain. More rain.
- What?

572
01:36:30,879 --> 01:36:33,177
We can't move even if it stops.

573
01:36:34,583 --> 01:36:38,212
We go out there
and we'll get beheaded.

574
01:36:39,120 --> 01:36:42,214
You madman.
Are you glad to be beheaded?

575
01:36:43,859 --> 01:36:44,826
Why not?

576
01:36:46,194 --> 01:36:48,754
It's better than putting up
with this.

577
01:36:49,598 --> 01:36:53,227
Then give up the gold and get lost.

578
01:36:56,304 --> 01:36:57,362
Good idea.

579
01:36:58,306 --> 01:36:59,330
I'll leave.

580
01:37:00,008 --> 01:37:01,839
But I'm taking all I can carry.

581
01:37:02,711 --> 01:37:04,372
I'll be set for life.

582
01:37:16,892 --> 01:37:18,257
I'll leave too.

583
01:37:22,998 --> 01:37:26,399
Great. What's left is all mine.

584
01:37:27,736 --> 01:37:29,465
Take what you want and beat it.

585
01:37:37,545 --> 01:37:41,311
But we're not getting anywhere.

586
01:37:52,460 --> 01:37:53,324
Where are you going?

587
01:37:54,596 --> 01:37:57,793
I'm going to find something
to put the gold in.

588
01:39:15,710 --> 01:39:18,838
The one with the shorter one
disappears for a while.

589
01:40:23,244 --> 01:40:24,336
He's late.

590
01:40:25,447 --> 01:40:29,907
I'm sure he'll be back soon.

591
01:41:19,834 --> 01:41:22,302
What's going on?
Everyone is carrying wood...

592
01:41:23,505 --> 01:41:25,132
I know! It's the Fire Festival.

593
01:41:25,807 --> 01:41:30,904
Haven't you heard of the Yamana
Fire Festival where the villagers

594
01:41:31,045 --> 01:41:32,478
dance around a bonfire?

595
01:41:33,047 --> 01:41:34,378
We lucked out!

596
01:41:38,820 --> 01:41:42,688
They're going in our direction.
If we join the crowd...

597
01:41:51,332 --> 01:41:55,462
I don't get it. Why do we have
to patrol a Fire Festival?

598
01:41:56,437 --> 01:41:58,997
Look. There's a lot
of wood at the Festival.

599
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:04,377
The Akizuki clan may hide here
with their gold hidden in firewood.

600
01:42:07,115 --> 01:42:07,877
What's this?

601
01:43:11,346 --> 01:43:13,143
There is too much wood to check.

602
01:43:13,581 --> 01:43:17,745
We'll inspect the suspicious ones
who stray from the crowd.

603
01:43:47,915 --> 01:43:48,506
Where is everyone?

604
01:43:48,650 --> 01:43:50,174
To the Festival...

605
01:43:50,318 --> 01:43:51,376
Marching with the crowd...

606
01:44:00,862 --> 01:44:09,236
The life of a man

607
01:44:10,138 --> 01:44:16,270
Burn it with the fire

608
01:44:17,512 --> 01:44:26,079
The life of an insect

609
01:44:26,821 --> 01:44:33,488
Throw it into the fire

610
01:44:35,997 --> 01:44:44,666
Ponder and you'll see

611
01:44:45,606 --> 01:44:51,567
The world is dark

612
01:44:53,181 --> 01:45:03,580
And this floating world is a dream

613
01:45:04,392 --> 01:45:12,390
Burn with abandon

614
01:45:34,389 --> 01:45:38,826
Burn it! Throw the cart
into the fire!

615
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:40,458
No!

616
01:45:43,364 --> 01:45:48,392
- Don't be stingy, fool.
- No!

617
01:45:50,638 --> 01:45:51,605
They're suspicious.

618
01:45:53,141 --> 01:45:55,336
Move. Burn it!

619
01:46:12,960 --> 01:46:14,018
Dance!

620
01:47:41,582 --> 01:47:43,379
That's enough. Let's pack it up.

621
01:47:43,818 --> 01:47:45,251
But, Boss, there's more...

622
01:47:46,020 --> 01:47:47,112
Don't be greedy!

623
01:47:48,756 --> 01:47:50,587
There's no point in taking more
than we can carry.

624
01:47:51,792 --> 01:47:55,523
You two carry 30 kan each.

625
01:47:56,864 --> 01:47:59,298
I carry 40... with the two women,
that's 20...

626
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:01,768
What? I can carry 40 kan too.

627
01:48:02,336 --> 01:48:03,428
I'll carry 50 kan.

628
01:48:45,613 --> 01:48:46,545
Hurry up!

629
01:49:34,261 --> 01:49:37,424
It's such a shame to leave
that gold.

630
01:49:42,036 --> 01:49:42,934
Go back?

631
01:49:51,212 --> 01:49:53,112
Where are you going?

632
01:50:25,079 --> 01:50:26,512
No more.

633
01:50:27,682 --> 01:50:28,580
What are you looking for?

634
01:51:37,017 --> 01:51:39,315
Boss, help us!

635
01:51:40,888 --> 01:51:43,288
Help!

636
01:52:13,487 --> 01:52:14,886
If you want to live,
pick up your load.

637
01:52:44,084 --> 01:52:45,949
Follow me!

638
01:54:16,477 --> 01:54:20,641
Hurry up! We can cross
the mountain overnight.

639
01:55:06,527 --> 01:55:09,394
It's hard. I'd rather be dead.

640
01:55:12,366 --> 01:55:13,560
Then die.

641
01:55:35,656 --> 01:55:36,680
Boss!

642
01:55:37,558 --> 01:55:38,388
Calm down!

643
01:56:00,214 --> 01:56:01,078
Don't stand up!

644
01:56:04,118 --> 01:56:07,781
Listen! I'll run and distract them.
Escape while you can.

645
01:56:38,752 --> 01:56:40,185
We're done for. Let's run.

646
01:56:42,523 --> 01:56:43,319
Farewell!

647
01:56:45,092 --> 01:56:46,059
Did you say something?

648
01:57:04,511 --> 01:57:09,915
I'm not worth it. Leave me and go.

649
01:57:37,044 --> 01:57:39,979
It's the end.

650
01:57:43,183 --> 01:57:45,879
If we get caught, they'll kill us.

651
01:57:49,289 --> 01:57:51,723
Not if we don't have any gold.

652
01:57:52,526 --> 01:57:53,857
We'll turn them in.

653
01:57:54,962 --> 01:57:58,864
You're right.
Maybe we'll even get a reward.

654
01:57:58,999 --> 01:58:03,436
Idiot! They'll shoot us
if we're not careful.

655
01:58:06,874 --> 01:58:11,971
I'm sure Yamana and Hayakawa
are patrolling their border.

656
01:58:13,213 --> 01:58:14,612
We can report them there.

657
01:59:11,738 --> 01:59:13,535
Your Highness... Hayakawa.

658
01:59:30,724 --> 01:59:34,353
Are you joking? We got them
and their gold long ago.

659
01:59:34,761 --> 01:59:36,285
Go home, fools.

660
02:00:12,132 --> 02:00:18,037
Look carefully! You won't see
200 gold pieces again!

661
02:00:22,376 --> 02:00:25,140
I'd rather see Princess Yuki!

662
02:00:25,879 --> 02:00:27,107
She's a sight for sore eyes.

663
02:00:28,582 --> 02:00:31,745
To think she'll be beheaded
tomorrow...

664
02:00:34,855 --> 02:00:35,651
Stay away!

665
02:00:35,789 --> 02:00:36,949
Just a glance.

666
02:00:41,028 --> 02:00:42,859
Let me through!

667
02:00:45,666 --> 02:00:48,931
Tadokoro here to identify them.

668
02:01:08,889 --> 02:01:11,255
Hyoe Tadokoro!

669
02:01:26,740 --> 02:01:27,707
What happened to you?

670
02:01:40,554 --> 02:01:41,578
Where did you get that scar?

671
02:01:54,301 --> 02:01:56,895
You. You've changed.

672
02:02:00,407 --> 02:02:01,533
Naturally.

673
02:02:04,077 --> 02:02:08,173
Tell me what happened. We're on
opposite sides,

674
02:02:09,049 --> 02:02:10,744
but we're true friends.

675
02:02:11,785 --> 02:02:17,155
Friends? Then why did you let me
survive the shame of my defeat?

676
02:02:18,358 --> 02:02:21,088
To defeat an enemy and to let him
live appears to be a kind act,

677
02:02:21,228 --> 02:02:23,788
but it is cruel.

678
02:02:24,865 --> 02:02:27,299
Look at me!

679
02:02:28,201 --> 02:02:29,964
My Lord shamed me
before everyone.

680
02:02:30,804 --> 02:02:32,829
See the scar left by
the relentless beating?

681
02:02:35,108 --> 02:02:36,097
I curse you!

682
02:02:36,676 --> 02:02:40,942
Fool! Are you the
great Hyoe Tadokoro?

683
02:02:44,217 --> 02:02:46,117
What you make of another's
kindness is up to you.

684
02:02:46,586 --> 02:02:51,387
You and your Lord.
Evidently you're both fools.

685
02:02:53,460 --> 02:02:57,863
To punish you so for losing
to an enemy...

686
02:02:59,366 --> 02:03:02,529
Even I do not dare such a thing.

687
02:03:02,803 --> 02:03:04,464
I'm the Princess. It's me.

688
02:03:04,604 --> 02:03:05,662
Stop.

689
02:03:07,207 --> 02:03:09,801
I appreciate your loyalty,
but this is it.

690
02:03:12,979 --> 02:03:14,503
I want to die with dignity.

691
02:03:16,016 --> 02:03:20,453
Your Highness, this Rokurota
cannot apologize enough.

692
02:03:21,521 --> 02:03:25,821
You endured so much
and it was all in vain.

693
02:03:26,893 --> 02:03:31,387
You're wrong, Rokurota.
I had a good time.

694
02:03:35,035 --> 02:03:38,095
The happiness of these days
I would have

695
02:03:38,238 --> 02:03:40,706
never known living in the castle.

696
02:03:43,009 --> 02:03:45,068
I saw people as they really are...

697
02:03:46,346 --> 02:03:54,412
I saw their beauty and their
ugliness with my own eyes.

698
02:03:57,157 --> 02:04:00,615
Rokurota, I thank you.

699
02:04:02,796 --> 02:04:07,927
- I can now die without regret.
- Your Highness!

700
02:04:09,936 --> 02:04:10,994
Rokurota.

701
02:04:13,006 --> 02:04:16,407
That Fire Festival was fun.

702
02:04:19,579 --> 02:04:20,978
I like that song.

703
02:04:25,452 --> 02:04:38,456
The life of a man

704
02:04:40,433 --> 02:04:48,568
Burn it with the fire

705
02:04:50,510 --> 02:05:01,148
The life of an insect

706
02:05:02,622 --> 02:05:11,655
Throw it into the fire

707
02:05:13,700 --> 02:05:25,601
Ponder and you'll see

708
02:05:26,947 --> 02:05:35,412
The world is dark

709
02:05:37,424 --> 02:05:48,392
And this floating world is a dream

710
02:06:57,003 --> 02:07:05,274
The life of a man

711
02:07:08,815 --> 02:07:16,517
Burn it with the fire

712
02:07:22,262 --> 02:07:23,251
Let's burn it!

713
02:07:26,633 --> 02:07:27,531
Turn the horses!

714
02:07:30,970 --> 02:07:32,665
Turn them, I said!

715
02:07:45,952 --> 02:07:48,113
He's mad! Get them!

716
02:08:19,552 --> 02:08:23,010
Hurry, Rokurota! Take the Princess!

717
02:08:35,034 --> 02:08:37,628
She is a great leader...
serve her well.

718
02:08:40,473 --> 02:08:41,337
Hyoe!

719
02:08:43,409 --> 02:08:46,572
Don't die in vain!
If you wish, follow us!

720
02:08:51,684 --> 02:08:52,343
Come!

721
02:09:25,885 --> 02:09:26,874
Forgive this traitor!

722
02:11:40,253 --> 02:11:44,849
Damn. When I got to Hayakawa
with the gold,

723
02:11:46,492 --> 02:11:49,290
I imagined I'd be so happy.

724
02:11:56,536 --> 02:11:58,663
We're lucky to have our heads.

725
02:12:01,074 --> 02:12:04,407
Let's stay friends.

726
02:12:07,313 --> 02:12:13,548
We risked death together, we'll stay
friends back at the village.

727
02:12:36,943 --> 02:12:38,035
Stray horses.

728
02:12:53,259 --> 02:12:55,090
Gold!

729
02:13:13,079 --> 02:13:14,239
This is all mine.

730
02:13:14,580 --> 02:13:16,411
What? Give me one of them.

731
02:13:17,483 --> 02:13:18,882
I found them first.

732
02:13:19,652 --> 02:13:25,716
You are greedy. You said we
should split everything 50/50.

733
02:13:25,992 --> 02:13:27,584
That was then, this is now.

734
02:13:29,028 --> 02:13:31,223
You shithead.

735
02:14:29,822 --> 02:14:33,189
You. Are you from the Akizuki clan?

736
02:14:33,960 --> 02:14:38,294
No, we're just peasants.

737
02:14:39,432 --> 02:14:43,459
I don't get it.
Peasants with all this gold?

738
02:14:48,407 --> 02:14:49,237
Arrest them!

739
02:15:02,955 --> 02:15:08,291
Let's stay friends in heaven too.

740
02:15:33,553 --> 02:15:37,421
Matashichi! Tahei! Look up!

741
02:15:47,133 --> 02:15:49,260
What? It's me.

742
02:15:49,735 --> 02:15:53,637
No wonder.
Even I didn't recognize you.

743
02:15:54,774 --> 02:15:57,607
Your armor becomes you.

744
02:16:00,746 --> 02:16:02,043
Rokurota Makabe.

745
02:16:04,850 --> 02:16:06,818
You look even more handsome.

746
02:16:15,595 --> 02:16:20,726
You don't recognize
your Princess Yuki?

747
02:16:25,538 --> 02:16:28,371
The mute. The mute girl.

748
02:17:07,947 --> 02:17:10,347
Matashichi. Tahei.

749
02:17:12,985 --> 02:17:16,113
You two went through a lot for us.

750
02:17:17,423 --> 02:17:23,055
However, that gold is an indispensable
fund to restore Akizuki.

751
02:17:24,096 --> 02:17:28,192
Not I, not even the Princess
can take it.

752
02:17:30,136 --> 02:17:33,867
I hope you will be satisfied
with this. Here.

753
02:17:39,645 --> 02:17:43,411
Split it fairly. No fighting.

754
02:18:13,079 --> 02:18:16,139
You keep this.

755
02:18:17,216 --> 02:18:18,843
No you keep it.

756
02:18:19,852 --> 02:18:21,046
But...

757
02:18:21,187 --> 02:18:22,381
Don't worry about it.

758
02:18:39,071 --> 02:18:48,844
The End
