1
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,508
<i>In the year of our Lord...</i>

2
00:00:35,710 --> 00:00:40,420
<i>...Judea, for nearly a century,
had lain under the mastery of Rome.</i>

3
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:43,190
<i>In the seventh year of the reign
of Augustus Caesar...</i>

4
00:00:43,390 --> 00:00:45,745
<i>...an imperial decree
ordered every Judean...</i>

5
00:00:45,950 --> 00:00:48,305
<i>...each to return
to his place of birth...</i>

6
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:50,740
<i>...to be counted and taxed.</i>

7
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:55,423
<i>Converging ways of many of them led
to their capital city, Jerusalem...</i>

8
00:00:55,630 --> 00:00:58,542
<i>...the troubled heart of their land.</i>

9
00:00:58,870 --> 00:01:02,146
<i>The old city was dominated
by the fortress of Antonia...</i>

10
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:03,669
<i>...the seat of Roman power...</i>

11
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:05,906
<i>...and by the great golden temple...</i>

12
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:10,189
<i>...the outward sign of
an inward and imperishable faith.</i>

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,944
<i>Even while they obeyed
the will of Caesar...</i>

14
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:17,187
<i>...the people clung proudly
to their ancient heritage...</i>

15
00:01:17,390 --> 00:01:20,268
<i>...always remembering
the promise of their prophets...</i>

16
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:23,627
<i>...that one day there would be
born among them a redeemer...</i>

17
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:27,266
<i>...to bring them salvation
and perfect freedom.</i>

18
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,578
You'll be counted at Hebron.

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:39,666
-Name?
-Samuel.

20
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:40,985
-What city?
-Joppa.

21
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,543
-What family?
-Michael.

22
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,502
-Move on. Move on.
-Yes.

23
00:01:44,950 --> 00:01:46,224
-Name?
-Joseph.

24
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:47,909
-What city?
-Nazareth.

25
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:50,428
-What family?
-David of Bethlehem.

26
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:51,785
And the woman?

27
00:01:52,270 --> 00:01:53,146
My wife.

28
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,705
Move on.
You'll be counted at Bethlehem.

29
00:01:56,870 --> 00:01:58,269
Come on, come on.

30
00:08:03,790 --> 00:08:05,223
What village is this?

31
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:06,585
Nazareth.

32
00:08:07,350 --> 00:08:09,705
We should arrive in Jerusalem
tomorrow night.

33
00:08:28,470 --> 00:08:30,859
You're not watching
the soldiers, Joseph?

34
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:33,186
We've seen Romans before.

35
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:34,459
Yes...

36
00:08:35,150 --> 00:08:37,505
...and we will see them again.

37
00:08:40,990 --> 00:08:43,345
My table is not finished.

38
00:08:43,550 --> 00:08:45,029
Where is your son?

39
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:47,465
He's walking in the hills.

40
00:08:49,790 --> 00:08:52,179
He neglects his work, Joseph.

41
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:53,665
No.

42
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,219
Once, I reproached him with
forgetting his work. He said to me:

43
00:08:58,430 --> 00:09:00,990
"I must be about my father's business. "

44
00:09:01,230 --> 00:09:03,619
Then why isn't he here, working?

45
00:09:05,710 --> 00:09:07,143
He's working.

46
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,341
Trumpeters of the legion!

47
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,182
Welcome, Messala.

48
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:17,989
The command is yours.

49
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:19,538
Thank you.

50
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:22,423
Thank you for relieving me.

51
00:10:31,790 --> 00:10:32,905
Drusus...

52
00:10:35,110 --> 00:10:38,989
...when I was a boy, I dreamed
of commanding this garrison.

53
00:10:41,710 --> 00:10:43,701
Now the wheel has turned.

54
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:46,227
I am in command.

55
00:10:55,110 --> 00:10:56,509
Attention!

56
00:10:58,630 --> 00:11:01,588
Aisle one, face right!

57
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:03,865
Forward!

58
00:11:11,510 --> 00:11:13,182
I'd forgotten the heat.

59
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:15,388
If it were only the heat.

60
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:19,347
I lived here until I was 14.
Jerusalem was my home.

61
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,939
-My father was head of...
-Yes, I know.

62
00:11:22,430 --> 00:11:25,547
Your father is well-remembered.
Fine governor.

63
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,182
If there can be such a thing
in this forsaken land.

64
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:34,147
If you want to rise, Sextus,
do the difficult.

65
00:11:35,110 --> 00:11:37,180
I asked to be sent here.

66
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:41,227
You'll find the people changed
since you were a boy.

67
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:43,023
In what way?

68
00:11:43,270 --> 00:11:47,263
Oh, won't pay their taxes,
an irrational resentment of Rome....

69
00:11:48,710 --> 00:11:50,746
There's nothing new in all that.

70
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:54,659
And then there's religion. I tell
you, they're drunk with religion.

71
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:58,624
They smash the statues of our gods,
even those of the emperor.

72
00:11:59,710 --> 00:12:00,938
Punish them.

73
00:12:03,310 --> 00:12:04,629
We do.

74
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:07,302
When we can find them.

75
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:10,099
Find the leaders.

76
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:13,507
You don't know. There's nothing
you can put your finger on.

77
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:15,985
There are strange forces
at work here.

78
00:12:16,190 --> 00:12:17,623
This "messiah" business...

79
00:12:17,830 --> 00:12:20,390
I know. There was one
predicted when I was a boy.

80
00:12:20,590 --> 00:12:25,266
A king of the Jews, who will lead them
into some sort of anti-Roman paradise.

81
00:12:25,470 --> 00:12:26,903
Makes your head spin.

82
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,869
There's a wild man
in the desert named John...

83
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:31,987
...who drowns people in water.

84
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:35,978
And a carpenter's son who does magic
tricks. "Miracles" they call them.

85
00:12:36,230 --> 00:12:38,539
There's always a rabble-rouser
stirring up trouble.

86
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:40,866
No, no, no. This man is different.

87
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:44,580
He teaches that God is near,
in every man.

88
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:49,508
It's actually quite profound,
some of it.

89
00:12:51,030 --> 00:12:53,260
You've been too long away from Rome.

90
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,869
Go back, Sextus.

91
00:12:55,110 --> 00:12:57,419
Go to Capri.
Bathe, rest, lie by the sea...

92
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,667
...and forget that
God is in every man.

93
00:13:00,990 --> 00:13:04,699
-There is divinity in only one man.
-Yes, I know.

94
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:07,306
The emperor is displeased.

95
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:11,341
He wishes Judea made into a more
obedient and disciplined province.

96
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:14,622
He's ordered me to restore order.
I shall carry out his wishes.

97
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:19,187
How? You can break a man's skull,
arrest him, throw him into a dungeon.

98
00:13:19,390 --> 00:13:22,462
But how do you control this?
How do you fight an idea?

99
00:13:22,670 --> 00:13:24,422
Especially a new idea.

100
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:31,785
There's a Jew outside.
He wants to see the tribune Messala.

101
00:13:32,830 --> 00:13:34,104
I assume he has a name.

102
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:38,303
-He says he's a prince, Judah Ben-Hur.
-Then treat him like one!

103
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:42,748
Tell him I will join him.

104
00:13:43,670 --> 00:13:45,103
Yes, tribune.

105
00:13:45,950 --> 00:13:47,178
Centurion!

106
00:13:53,190 --> 00:13:56,148
This was his country
before it was ours.

107
00:13:56,630 --> 00:13:57,699
Don't forget that.

108
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,498
Yes, tribune.

109
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:06,064
Very wise. This Ben-Hur is
the richest man in Jerusalem.

110
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:12,508
And the head of one
of the greatest families in Judea.

111
00:14:12,710 --> 00:14:14,587
We were friends as boys.

112
00:14:15,150 --> 00:14:16,788
We were like brothers.

113
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,259
Sextus...

114
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:24,108
...you ask how to fight an idea.

115
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:26,222
Well, I'll tell you how.

116
00:14:27,350 --> 00:14:29,306
With another idea.

117
00:15:06,510 --> 00:15:08,262
I said I'd come back.

118
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:11,502
I never thought you would.

119
00:15:13,350 --> 00:15:14,829
I'm so glad.

120
00:15:23,230 --> 00:15:24,868
-Look at you.
-Look at you!

121
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,186
You've come back a tribune.

122
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:31,264
When I heard that news,
I drank a toast to you.

123
00:15:33,230 --> 00:15:34,743
We'll drink another now.

124
00:15:35,870 --> 00:15:37,747
-Your sister and mother?
-They're fine.

125
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,748
They've talked of you
ever since we knew you were coming.

126
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:42,269
-Is Tirzah married?
-No.

127
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:45,109
Suitors come and go, but she dreams.

128
00:15:45,310 --> 00:15:47,665
She's been in love with you
since she was 5.

129
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:49,940
I can't wait to see them.

130
00:15:50,190 --> 00:15:52,545
Do you still hunt jackals and lions?

131
00:15:52,750 --> 00:15:55,423
Or have you become too dignified?

132
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:15,789
-Down Eros, up Mars!
-Down Eros, up Mars!

133
00:16:24,670 --> 00:16:26,183
Where the beams cross?

134
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:40,625
Good.

135
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:00,467
After all these years!

136
00:17:01,830 --> 00:17:03,309
Still close.

137
00:17:03,550 --> 00:17:05,108
In every way.

138
00:17:07,870 --> 00:17:09,303
I hope so.

139
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:12,179
I know.

140
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:17,139
You're a Roman, and I'm a Jew...

141
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:19,949
...whose life you once saved.

142
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:23,587
The best thing I ever did.

143
00:17:28,230 --> 00:17:29,265
Judah...

144
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:33,784
...it will be very difficult
to govern here.

145
00:17:33,990 --> 00:17:35,548
I'm going to need help.

146
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:38,500
Your help. Your advice.

147
00:17:43,350 --> 00:17:45,705
-You want my advice?
-Yes, I do.

148
00:17:47,430 --> 00:17:49,182
Withdraw your legions.

149
00:17:51,510 --> 00:17:52,989
Give us our freedom.

150
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,469
Unfortunately, the emperor
is devoted to his empire.

151
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:01,865
He's particularly fond of Judea.

152
00:18:02,150 --> 00:18:04,789
And Judea's not fond of the emperor.

153
00:18:04,990 --> 00:18:08,460
Is there anything so sad
as unrequited love?

154
00:18:14,150 --> 00:18:15,299
My quarters.

155
00:18:16,670 --> 00:18:17,625
A bit grim.

156
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:19,229
Not grim.

157
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:21,864
Austere. Virtuous.

158
00:18:22,550 --> 00:18:23,539
Roman.

159
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:32,022
I'm going to be second-in-command
to the new governor, Valerius Gratus.

160
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:34,460
He's coming in a few days
with more legions.

161
00:18:36,910 --> 00:18:38,502
Then the rumors are true.

162
00:18:42,150 --> 00:18:44,505
The emperor does not approve
of your countrymen.

163
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:48,466
There is rebellion in the wind.
It will be crushed.

164
00:18:53,470 --> 00:18:55,745
But you and your family
need have no concern.

165
00:18:55,990 --> 00:18:58,629
I'm next in authority to the governor,
and you're my friend.

166
00:18:58,830 --> 00:19:01,708
-I'm a Jew.
-Ah, you are like a Roman!

167
00:19:01,910 --> 00:19:05,266
What have you in common
with the troublemaking rabble?

168
00:19:05,510 --> 00:19:08,707
-They're my people. I'm one of them.
-Be wise, Judah.

169
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:12,823
It's a Roman world. If you want to
live in it, you must become part of it.

170
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:14,779
You've changed.

171
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:18,346
I've grown up. I've seen the world
since I left Jerusalem.

172
00:19:18,550 --> 00:19:22,145
I've seen Rome. It's no accident
that one small village on the Tiber...

173
00:19:22,350 --> 00:19:23,988
...was chosen to rule the world.

174
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,822
Your legions.

175
00:19:27,430 --> 00:19:29,705
It wasn't just our legions.

176
00:19:30,550 --> 00:19:34,225
Other countries have armies,
fine armies. I know, I fought them.

177
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:35,465
Oh, no.

178
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:40,621
No, it was fate that chose us
to civilize the world. And we have.

179
00:19:40,830 --> 00:19:43,742
Our roads and ships connect
every corner of the earth.

180
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:47,266
Roman law, architecture, literature
are the glory of the human race.

181
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,779
I believe in the future of my people.

182
00:19:50,470 --> 00:19:53,507
Of course you do.
And you can help them.

183
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,865
How?

184
00:19:57,110 --> 00:19:58,338
You're an aristocrat.

185
00:19:58,550 --> 00:20:01,747
Your family's name is honored.
You're a prince to your people.

186
00:20:01,950 --> 00:20:04,510
You're rich and powerful.
Your reputation is stainless.

187
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:07,099
They'd listen if you
spoke out against rebellion.

188
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,507
Persuade your people that
their resistance to Rome is stupid.

189
00:20:10,710 --> 00:20:12,985
It is worse than stupid, futile!

190
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:16,546
For it can end in only one way,
extinction for your people!

191
00:20:21,990 --> 00:20:24,709
I'm against violence.
Everyone knows this.

192
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:27,424
I've spoken against it.
I shall do so again.

193
00:20:27,630 --> 00:20:28,949
Then we're agreed!

194
00:20:30,630 --> 00:20:32,985
Now, when can I come
to see your family?

195
00:20:34,710 --> 00:20:37,543
-We had hoped tomorrow.
-Good.

196
00:20:39,790 --> 00:20:41,348
And now for our toast.

197
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:46,261
It's dreadful wine, by the way.

198
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:49,788
It's especially fermented
for the Roman army.

199
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:52,820
You're very cruel to your conquerors.

200
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,546
It's an insane world.

201
00:21:00,950 --> 00:21:03,339
But in it there is one sanity:

202
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:06,339
The loyalty of old friends.

203
00:21:08,390 --> 00:21:10,824
Judah, we must believe in one another.

204
00:21:11,590 --> 00:21:13,182
Will you drink to that?

205
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,862
With all my heart.

206
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:40,464
Here it is, the place I've remembered.

207
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:43,339
The court where we played
at changing the guard.

208
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:47,589
The roof where we'd throw pebbles
at people in the street and then hide.

209
00:21:47,870 --> 00:21:51,021
-We were rascals, weren't we?
-No, you were good boys.

210
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,226
I would have that time again.

211
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,785
And here it is. Nothing has changed.

212
00:21:55,990 --> 00:21:57,389
Except for the fountain.

213
00:21:57,590 --> 00:22:01,583
-The old well would go dry, remember?
-Promptly, every summer.

214
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:06,343
A new fountain and a new Tirzah.
You've grown up.

215
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:09,980
-He hasn't changed, has he, Mother?
-No?

216
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:14,542
Of course he has. He was a boy
when he left us, now he's a man.

217
00:22:14,750 --> 00:22:16,980
With great responsibilities.

218
00:22:18,190 --> 00:22:19,259
Come.

219
00:22:20,270 --> 00:22:23,580
The emperor builds and builds,
turning brick to marble.

220
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,623
Oh, I almost forgot.
I brought you this.

221
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:34,465
I've never seen anything
like this before. It's beautiful!

222
00:22:34,670 --> 00:22:37,548
-Is it Roman?
-It's Libyan. I was there last year.

223
00:22:37,750 --> 00:22:39,229
A tremendous campaign.

224
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,740
Our armies met on the coast.
After two days of fighting, they fled.

225
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:46,022
We marched on their capital.
Barbaric city, but fascinating.

226
00:22:46,270 --> 00:22:48,022
Or was, till we destroyed it.

227
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:51,902
Now it's nothing but ashes.

228
00:22:54,150 --> 00:22:56,266
I'm boring you with soldier stories.

229
00:22:57,150 --> 00:23:00,222
Come with me, there's something
I want to show you.

230
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:02,305
Thank you for this.

231
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:06,298
I chose the right present for you.
It's a brooch for a woman.

232
00:23:21,430 --> 00:23:22,829
What do you think of it?

233
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:25,829
Magnificent.

234
00:23:29,630 --> 00:23:31,109
It's Arabic.

235
00:23:31,390 --> 00:23:34,587
I think he has the look of the breed.
I've raised him.

236
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:36,383
Let me try him sometime.

237
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:38,979
Whenever you like. He's yours.

238
00:23:42,150 --> 00:23:43,868
Do you mean you'll give me this?

239
00:23:44,470 --> 00:23:46,108
Oh, Judah.

240
00:23:47,910 --> 00:23:51,698
You are good. It's going
to be like old times, I know it.

241
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,302
Judah, tell me, did you...

242
00:24:00,990 --> 00:24:02,389
...think about what I said?

243
00:24:02,590 --> 00:24:05,184
Yes. Talked to a number
of people already.

244
00:24:05,390 --> 00:24:07,984
Spoken against violence,
against incidents.

245
00:24:08,230 --> 00:24:09,982
Most of the men agree with me.

246
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,107
Most? Not all?

247
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:14,104
No, not all.

248
00:24:14,310 --> 00:24:15,504
Who does not agree?

249
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:19,503
Well, the resentful, the impatient.

250
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,699
Who are they?

251
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:26,663
Yes, Judah. Who are they?

252
00:24:33,430 --> 00:24:36,183
Would I retain your friendship
if I became an informer?

253
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:38,460
Telling the names of criminals
is not informing.

254
00:24:38,670 --> 00:24:41,389
They're not criminals, Messala.
They're patriots.

255
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:43,023
Patriots?!

256
00:24:50,430 --> 00:24:54,343
Let me explain something to you.
Something you may not know.

257
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:59,548
The emperor is watching us.
At this moment, he watches the East.

258
00:24:59,870 --> 00:25:02,543
This is my great opportunity,
and yours too.

259
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:05,139
If I bring order here,
I can have any post I want.

260
00:25:05,350 --> 00:25:08,501
You'll rise with me, I promise.
And do you know where it can end?

261
00:25:08,710 --> 00:25:11,588
Rome! Yes, perhaps at the side
of Caesar himself.

262
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:14,384
I mean it. It can happen
and this is the moment.

263
00:25:14,590 --> 00:25:16,262
I swear, this is the time.

264
00:25:16,470 --> 00:25:20,145
The emperor is watching us, judging
us. All I need do is serve him.

265
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:23,706
And all you need do
is help me serve him.

266
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:29,259
-You speak as if he were God.
-He is God. The only God.

267
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,349
He is power,
real power on earth, not...

268
00:25:34,910 --> 00:25:36,343
Not that.

269
00:25:38,550 --> 00:25:39,983
Help me, Judah.

270
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,983
I would do anything
for you, Messala...

271
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:48,349
...except betray my own people.

272
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:52,948
In the name of all the gods, what do
the lives of a few Jews mean to you?

273
00:25:56,110 --> 00:26:00,342
If I cannot persuade them, that does
not mean I would help you murder them.

274
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:05,819
Besides, you must
understand this, Messala.

275
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:08,624
I believe in the past
and future of my people.

276
00:26:08,830 --> 00:26:11,390
Future? You are a conquered people.

277
00:26:13,350 --> 00:26:16,899
You may conquer the land.
You may slaughter the people.

278
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,186
But that is not the end.
We will rise again.

279
00:26:19,590 --> 00:26:23,469
You live on dead dreams.
You live on the myths of the past.

280
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:25,945
Solomon's glory is gone.
You think it will return?

281
00:26:26,190 --> 00:26:28,988
Joshua will not rise again
to save you nor David.

282
00:26:29,230 --> 00:26:32,939
There is only one reality in
the world today. Look to the West.

283
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,509
Don't be a fool! Look to Rome!

284
00:26:34,710 --> 00:26:36,666
Better a fool
than a traitor or a killer.

285
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:39,543
-I am a soldier.
-Who kills for Rome and Rome is evil.

286
00:26:39,750 --> 00:26:42,583
-I warn you...
-No! I warn you.

287
00:26:42,790 --> 00:26:44,462
Rome is an affront to God.

288
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:47,901
Rome is strangling my people
and my country, the whole earth!

289
00:26:48,150 --> 00:26:49,503
But not forever.

290
00:26:49,710 --> 00:26:53,305
And I tell you, the day Rome falls
there will be a shout of freedom...

291
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,149
...such as the world
has never heard before.

292
00:27:04,830 --> 00:27:08,584
Either you help me or you oppose me.
You have no other choice.

293
00:27:09,350 --> 00:27:11,784
You're either for me or against me.

294
00:27:16,990 --> 00:27:19,220
If that is the choice...

295
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,386
...then I am against you.

296
00:27:48,950 --> 00:27:50,303
There they are.

297
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,343
Where's Messala?

298
00:27:55,150 --> 00:27:56,788
-Where's...?
-He's gone.

299
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,698
Gone?

300
00:27:59,870 --> 00:28:01,622
-But why?
-He couldn't stay.

301
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:05,140
-What happened?
-A new tribune must have many duties.

302
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:08,023
Come. Let us have dinner.

303
00:28:21,670 --> 00:28:24,503
Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God,
King of the world...

304
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:27,019
...who bringeth to us
bread from the earth.

305
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,665
We shall never see him again, Tirzah.

306
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:42,142
He wanted to use me
to betray our people.

307
00:29:29,630 --> 00:29:32,906
-Master, the caravan from Antioch.
-Yes, Amrah, I saw.

308
00:29:33,950 --> 00:29:35,508
Simonides.

309
00:29:39,270 --> 00:29:41,704
-Oh, welcome homecoming.
-Master.

310
00:29:41,910 --> 00:29:44,378
Simonides has brought gifts, as usual.

311
00:29:44,590 --> 00:29:47,309
Amber and jade for me.
Silk for Tirzah.

312
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:49,307
And for the master, Iberian wine.

313
00:29:49,510 --> 00:29:52,308
Not to mention the best gift of all,
your presence

314
00:29:52,510 --> 00:29:56,139
You do your servant honor.
I also bring good news from Antioch.

315
00:29:56,350 --> 00:29:58,818
-Caravans from Petra.
-Have all arrived.

316
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:00,748
-Good.
-Here is the accounting.

317
00:30:00,950 --> 00:30:02,269
And what of Numidia?

318
00:30:02,470 --> 00:30:05,940
The trade route is ours,
guaranteed by treaty with the king.

319
00:30:06,470 --> 00:30:08,620
Once a year,
you bring your accounting.

320
00:30:08,830 --> 00:30:11,549
And once a year,
I find myself wealthier.

321
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:14,498
Yeah, but my greatest treasure
is my steward.

322
00:30:14,830 --> 00:30:17,219
My life belongs to the House of Hur.

323
00:30:17,430 --> 00:30:20,661
Nothing else exists for me,
except my daughter.

324
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,460
-She must be a young woman by now.
-Yes, and your property.

325
00:30:24,670 --> 00:30:26,581
She was born
the daughter of your slave.

326
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:30,226
When I inherited you,
I inherited a friend, not a slave.

327
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:33,979
Still, Esther has come with me from
Antioch for your permission to marry.

328
00:30:34,230 --> 00:30:37,779
It's granted. I wish you
the joy of many grandchildren.

329
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:41,221
If it is the Lord's will,
I shall rejoice.

330
00:31:14,270 --> 00:31:17,228
With your permission,
Esther wishes to speak to her master.

331
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,665
You're eager to marry, Esther?

332
00:31:38,910 --> 00:31:40,741
It is my father's wish.

333
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:45,780
Your husband will be fortunate.

334
00:31:47,430 --> 00:31:48,829
What is his name?

335
00:31:49,630 --> 00:31:51,666
David, son of Mathias.

336
00:31:51,870 --> 00:31:53,428
Of what house?

337
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:56,710
-His own, master.
-He is a freeman.

338
00:31:58,430 --> 00:31:59,579
Tell me more about him.

339
00:32:01,470 --> 00:32:03,142
I have seen him only once.

340
00:32:03,350 --> 00:32:05,386
He is a merchant,
well-thought-of in Antioch.

341
00:32:05,790 --> 00:32:07,985
He will pay for Esther's freedom.

342
00:32:08,430 --> 00:32:11,945
Her freedom will be
my wedding gift to Esther.

343
00:32:15,710 --> 00:32:17,826
You are generous, master.

344
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:25,706
Do you love this man?

345
00:32:30,230 --> 00:32:32,107
I will learn to love him.

346
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,586
You have my permission to marry.

347
00:32:52,350 --> 00:32:54,625
We'll drink to your happiness.

348
00:32:55,630 --> 00:32:57,939
And a safe return to Antioch.

349
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,502
I disturbed you.

350
00:33:24,150 --> 00:33:25,185
No.

351
00:33:25,830 --> 00:33:27,388
What were you thinking?

352
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:30,580
I was saying goodbye...

353
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:32,783
...to this city...

354
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:35,302
...and this house.

355
00:33:39,550 --> 00:33:43,259
You've not often been here.
What do you remember of it?

356
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,944
My father sometimes brought me here...

357
00:33:47,310 --> 00:33:48,743
...when I was little.

358
00:33:50,510 --> 00:33:53,707
It was a house
where I was always happy.

359
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:57,982
Except once.

360
00:33:59,350 --> 00:34:02,103
When you and your friend,
the Roman boy...

361
00:34:02,590 --> 00:34:04,308
-Messala.
-Yes.

362
00:34:05,190 --> 00:34:07,101
You had been out hunting...

363
00:34:08,350 --> 00:34:10,864
...and they brought you home injured.

364
00:34:12,710 --> 00:34:15,099
I touched your face
as you lay there...

365
00:34:19,510 --> 00:34:23,219
...and prayed to God,
"Don't let this boy die. "

366
00:34:26,630 --> 00:34:31,021
I can hear how you said it.
Gently, as you say it now.

367
00:34:32,950 --> 00:34:33,985
Yes, master.

368
00:34:34,230 --> 00:34:37,506
Master?
Why, I've given you your freedom.

369
00:34:39,470 --> 00:34:43,258
It's strange. I hardly felt a slave.

370
00:34:48,590 --> 00:34:49,818
And now...

371
00:34:51,350 --> 00:34:53,022
...I hardly feel free.

372
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:58,899
You know, in the old, wise days
of Solomon...

373
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,141
...if there was among his slaves...

374
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:04,023
...some girl who filled his eyes...

375
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:07,230
...he could choose her out
from the rest...

376
00:35:08,350 --> 00:35:09,829
...and take her to him.

377
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:12,865
Wise days of Solomon.

378
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:15,908
Different days.

379
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,263
And long ago.

380
00:35:28,910 --> 00:35:31,344
If you were not a bride...

381
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:34,505
...I should kiss you goodbye.

382
00:35:37,310 --> 00:35:39,141
If I were not a bride...

383
00:35:39,710 --> 00:35:42,144
...there would be no goodbyes
to be said.

384
00:35:54,910 --> 00:35:56,662
Your slave ring.

385
00:36:00,030 --> 00:36:01,668
Fair exchange.

386
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:06,382
Freedom to you. The ring to me.

387
00:36:06,790 --> 00:36:08,382
You will wear it?

388
00:36:15,710 --> 00:36:18,224
Until you meet the woman
you will marry?

389
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:26,703
Until then.

390
00:37:57,310 --> 00:37:59,221
The gods favor my lord Gratus.

391
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:02,547
If it is the governor's pleasure,
the wreath of office.

392
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:04,383
Thank you, tribune.

393
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:08,741
I see no delegation from the city.

394
00:38:08,950 --> 00:38:11,020
-There will not be one, sir.
-No?

395
00:38:11,270 --> 00:38:13,500
Jerusalem's welcome will not
be a warm one.

396
00:38:13,710 --> 00:38:16,383
But I pledge, my lord,
it will be a quiet one.

397
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:18,509
Let us proceed.

398
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,349
There's Messala.

399
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:32,822
He saw you, Judah.

400
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:02,669
The new governor.

401
00:40:18,030 --> 00:40:19,304
Stand back!

402
00:40:21,310 --> 00:40:23,619
-Stand back.
-You, come!

403
00:40:23,910 --> 00:40:25,662
Had to be the Jews!

404
00:40:31,790 --> 00:40:34,463
Open up in the name
of the divine emperor!

405
00:40:44,590 --> 00:40:48,139
Judah! Tirzah! What is it?
What's happened?

406
00:40:48,350 --> 00:40:50,147
Open up in the name of the law!

407
00:40:50,350 --> 00:40:53,342
-I was watching the...
-A tile fell and struck the governor.

408
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:55,620
-It wasn't my fault.
-They won't believe her.

409
00:40:55,830 --> 00:40:59,300
She won't have to say anything.
You hear? Tirzah, say nothing.

410
00:40:59,750 --> 00:41:01,502
Open the gates!

411
00:41:07,510 --> 00:41:08,909
I'll speak to them.

412
00:41:09,630 --> 00:41:11,905
-Arrest him!
-Let me tell you what happened.

413
00:41:12,150 --> 00:41:14,300
-Hold those women.
-Stop them!

414
00:41:15,030 --> 00:41:16,509
It was an accident.

415
00:41:18,510 --> 00:41:21,946
Let me tell you what happened.
It was an accident.

416
00:41:22,190 --> 00:41:25,546
-This is the man, sir. We saw him.
-It was an accident.

417
00:41:26,750 --> 00:41:28,024
-Accident?
-I swear it.

418
00:41:28,230 --> 00:41:31,381
I put my hand on the ledge.
A tile was loose. It gave way.

419
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:33,342
Take him. Take all of them.

420
00:41:33,550 --> 00:41:37,304
-He's telling the truth!
-It was me! Let them go!

421
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:39,269
Attention!

422
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,784
Messala.

423
00:41:54,030 --> 00:41:56,498
In the name of God,
tell them it's a mistake.

424
00:41:56,710 --> 00:41:59,668
I leaned on the tile,
and it broke loose.

425
00:42:03,110 --> 00:42:05,305
It was an accident.

426
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:17,307
Let them go!
They had nothing to do with it!

427
00:42:22,750 --> 00:42:24,149
Let the servants go.

428
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,910
Let them go. Return to your ranks.

429
00:43:52,670 --> 00:43:53,739
Come.

430
00:43:54,030 --> 00:43:55,099
Where?

431
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:56,945
Tirus.

432
00:43:58,710 --> 00:44:00,109
Tirus?

433
00:44:02,030 --> 00:44:03,748
I've had no trial.

434
00:44:04,390 --> 00:44:07,143
I'm to die in the galleys
without even a trial?

435
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:09,944
There's no truth in the charge!
Not a word of truth!

436
00:44:10,190 --> 00:44:13,307
Wait. My mother, my sister.
What happened to them?

437
00:44:13,510 --> 00:44:14,943
Tie his hands.

438
00:44:17,390 --> 00:44:20,860
-At least tell me if they're safe.
-I can tell you nothing.

439
00:44:50,430 --> 00:44:51,909
Get along. Keep moving.

440
00:45:06,510 --> 00:45:07,704
Jailer!

441
00:45:09,110 --> 00:45:11,226
Guard, in there!

442
00:45:11,710 --> 00:45:13,507
Up the stairs!

443
00:45:13,870 --> 00:45:14,939
Jailer!

444
00:45:16,750 --> 00:45:17,819
Jailer!

445
00:45:19,870 --> 00:45:21,144
To the right.

446
00:46:13,256 --> 00:46:15,406
-Wait!
-Send them out.

447
00:46:24,536 --> 00:46:25,605
Go!

448
00:46:30,336 --> 00:46:31,371
The door.

449
00:46:39,736 --> 00:46:41,852
Where are my mother and sister?

450
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:54,205
Where are they?

451
00:46:57,296 --> 00:46:59,412
Here, within these walls.

452
00:47:00,576 --> 00:47:03,010
The governor is recovering.
They won't die.

453
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:07,127
Of course, they will be sentenced.

454
00:47:10,616 --> 00:47:12,368
Is it possible?

455
00:47:15,416 --> 00:47:18,249
Is it possible
you could do this to us?

456
00:47:18,456 --> 00:47:20,492
To people you've known?
A family you've loved?

457
00:47:23,616 --> 00:47:26,653
You will let them go.
You will gladly let them go!

458
00:47:30,816 --> 00:47:33,808
I didn't try to kill the governor.
I'm not a murderer!

459
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:35,608
I know you're not.

460
00:47:37,016 --> 00:47:38,734
You know?

461
00:47:42,616 --> 00:47:43,765
You are evil.

462
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:46,605
No, Judah, I am not evil.

463
00:47:47,296 --> 00:47:48,968
I wanted your help.

464
00:47:49,696 --> 00:47:51,527
Now you've given it to me.

465
00:47:52,336 --> 00:47:55,453
By making this example of you,
I discourage treason.

466
00:47:55,736 --> 00:47:59,524
By condemning without hesitation
an old friend, I shall be feared.

467
00:48:02,136 --> 00:48:04,127
But not my family.

468
00:48:05,496 --> 00:48:07,134
Let them go.

469
00:48:07,736 --> 00:48:08,691
Please.

470
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:13,411
-Messala, I beg you.
-Beg?!

471
00:48:16,416 --> 00:48:18,452
Didn't I beg you?

472
00:48:23,576 --> 00:48:26,295
You chose this.
There's nothing more to be said.

473
00:48:27,136 --> 00:48:29,286
Kill me, and your mother
and sister will die...

474
00:48:29,496 --> 00:48:31,726
...nailed to crosses in front of you!

475
00:48:33,656 --> 00:48:35,328
Go on, Judah.

476
00:48:36,376 --> 00:48:37,570
Kill me!

477
00:48:49,976 --> 00:48:52,171
May God grant me vengeance.

478
00:48:52,376 --> 00:48:56,051
I will pray that
you live till I return.

479
00:48:57,056 --> 00:48:58,011
Return?

480
00:49:03,336 --> 00:49:04,405
Take him.

481
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:39,852
Sentries, salute.

482
00:49:42,936 --> 00:49:44,654
The tribune will see you now.

483
00:50:14,816 --> 00:50:18,286
Tribune, I'm steward
of the House of Hur.

484
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:20,969
I remember you.

485
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:24,891
We were on our way to Antioch
when we heard what had happened.

486
00:50:25,136 --> 00:50:28,731
Judah Ben-Hur could not have done
this thing. You knew him, tribune.

487
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:30,449
Better than you.

488
00:50:30,696 --> 00:50:34,974
Then there must be no doubt in
your mind, the charge is groundless.

489
00:50:35,296 --> 00:50:37,332
The prisoners have been sentenced.

490
00:50:37,696 --> 00:50:39,687
-Sentenced?
-But there's no truth in it.

491
00:50:39,896 --> 00:50:43,252
There was never a threat against
the governor in Judah's mind.

492
00:50:43,456 --> 00:50:46,129
Surely you must know
he would never have done this.

493
00:50:46,336 --> 00:50:48,531
In your heart, you must know it.

494
00:50:53,656 --> 00:50:54,771
Drusus.

495
00:50:59,536 --> 00:51:02,733
This man had better be kept here
until we can question him.

496
00:51:56,136 --> 00:51:57,251
Hold!

497
00:52:51,056 --> 00:52:52,728
Water for the soldiers.

498
00:52:53,056 --> 00:52:54,774
Soldiers first!

499
00:52:57,376 --> 00:53:00,049
Get away from that well.
No water for them!

500
00:53:00,536 --> 00:53:03,004
Get them away from that well!
Here, you!

501
00:53:03,256 --> 00:53:05,975
Come on, you! Water for the horses!

502
00:53:09,816 --> 00:53:12,569
-Water. Water.
-Soldiers first!

503
00:53:21,056 --> 00:53:22,125
Here.

504
00:53:44,136 --> 00:53:45,205
Wait.

505
00:53:46,176 --> 00:53:47,768
No water for him.

506
00:54:08,856 --> 00:54:10,255
God...

507
00:54:10,976 --> 00:54:12,853
...help me.

508
00:55:04,536 --> 00:55:07,289
You! I said no water for him!

509
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,252
All right, on your feet, all of you!

510
00:55:42,496 --> 00:55:43,815
Get them on their feet!

511
00:55:44,896 --> 00:55:46,932
Back in line, you dog!

512
00:55:59,456 --> 00:56:00,809
On your feet!

513
00:56:01,176 --> 00:56:02,575
Get them going!

514
00:56:05,536 --> 00:56:08,846
You there, back to your place!
Back to your place!

515
00:56:11,776 --> 00:56:13,687
Forward, you dogs!

516
00:57:16,256 --> 00:57:18,645
Soon, the counselor's barge
will be coming alongside.

517
00:57:18,856 --> 00:57:20,653
Be ready to raise oars.

518
00:57:26,616 --> 00:57:29,369
Raise oars!

519
00:57:31,736 --> 00:57:33,806
Down oars!

520
00:57:51,496 --> 00:57:53,168
The new commander, Quintus Arrius.

521
00:58:12,776 --> 00:58:15,495
-How many rowers?
-Two hundred, consul.

522
00:58:15,696 --> 00:58:18,415
-And reliefs?
-Of 30, every hour.

523
00:58:51,896 --> 00:58:54,933
This man is ill. Replace him.

524
00:58:55,176 --> 00:58:57,212
-Change him.
-Right, sir.

525
00:59:02,856 --> 00:59:06,405
-This man's been giving you trouble?
-He's insubordinate, consul.

526
00:59:06,696 --> 00:59:08,573
That will stop.

527
00:59:31,736 --> 00:59:33,692
What service have you seen?

528
00:59:35,576 --> 00:59:36,929
Forty-one.

529
00:59:37,736 --> 00:59:40,967
A month's less a day in this ship.

530
00:59:41,616 --> 00:59:45,211
You keep an exact account.
And before?

531
00:59:45,416 --> 00:59:48,772
Three years in other ships.

532
00:59:50,216 --> 00:59:52,013
Three years.

533
01:00:12,416 --> 01:00:14,771
You have the spirit to fight back...

534
01:00:15,376 --> 01:00:17,526
...but the good sense to control it.

535
01:00:20,816 --> 01:00:24,445
Your eyes are full of hate, 41.

536
01:00:24,856 --> 01:00:28,849
That's good. Hate keeps a man alive.

537
01:00:29,176 --> 01:00:30,928
It gives him strength.

538
01:00:32,896 --> 01:00:34,534
Now, listen to me, all of you.

539
01:00:34,856 --> 01:00:39,213
You are all condemned men.
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

540
01:00:43,776 --> 01:00:45,653
So row well...

541
01:00:46,496 --> 01:00:48,054
...and live.

542
01:00:56,256 --> 01:00:58,850
-Ship ready, consul.
-Strike oars.

543
01:00:59,136 --> 01:01:02,572
Strike oars!

544
01:01:22,216 --> 01:01:24,366
You know a fleet
of Macedonian galleys...

545
01:01:24,576 --> 01:01:27,249
...has been raiding Roman commerce.

546
01:01:27,816 --> 01:01:30,649
The emperor has honored us
with the task...

547
01:01:30,856 --> 01:01:33,370
...of seeking out and destroying them.

548
01:02:03,896 --> 01:02:05,693
Battle speed, hortator.

549
01:02:07,816 --> 01:02:10,046
Battle speed!

550
01:02:39,376 --> 01:02:40,525
Attack speed.

551
01:02:41,016 --> 01:02:42,734
Attack speed!

552
01:03:21,456 --> 01:03:22,605
Ramming speed.

553
01:03:23,856 --> 01:03:25,335
Ramming speed!

554
01:04:36,456 --> 01:04:37,445
Rest.

555
01:04:38,216 --> 01:04:39,729
Halt!

556
01:04:40,776 --> 01:04:42,050
Rest!

557
01:05:42,656 --> 01:05:43,771
Why are you here?

558
01:05:43,976 --> 01:05:47,286
I was ordered to report to you
during my relief.

559
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:50,974
Oh, yes.

560
01:05:51,456 --> 01:05:53,014
I'd forgotten.

561
01:05:59,056 --> 01:06:01,126
You could have killed me
as I lay there.

562
01:06:01,336 --> 01:06:03,406
You're a condemned man.
Why didn't you?

563
01:06:04,016 --> 01:06:05,927
I'm not ready to die.

564
01:06:06,296 --> 01:06:08,173
What do you think will save you?

565
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,891
The God of my fathers.

566
01:06:12,416 --> 01:06:14,293
Your God has forsaken you.

567
01:06:14,496 --> 01:06:17,568
He has no more power
than the images I pray to.

568
01:06:17,776 --> 01:06:21,451
My gods will not help me.
Your God will not help you.

569
01:06:21,656 --> 01:06:23,055
I might.

570
01:06:23,496 --> 01:06:26,329
Does that interest you, 41?

571
01:06:28,296 --> 01:06:30,287
I can see that it does.

572
01:06:31,536 --> 01:06:34,573
I'm a fighting man by profession,
and in my leisure moments...

573
01:06:34,776 --> 01:06:37,449
...it amuses me to train fighting men.

574
01:06:37,656 --> 01:06:40,648
I own some of the best gladiators
and charioteers in Rome.

575
01:06:40,856 --> 01:06:42,972
Would you like to become one of them?

576
01:06:43,376 --> 01:06:45,253
To die as your slave?

577
01:06:45,656 --> 01:06:47,886
Better than to live in chains
below these decks.

578
01:06:48,496 --> 01:06:50,452
I will not be here forever.

579
01:06:51,816 --> 01:06:52,771
No?

580
01:06:57,016 --> 01:06:59,450
What would you do if you escaped?

581
01:07:00,856 --> 01:07:04,485
Two people were condemned with me,
my mother and sister...

582
01:07:04,696 --> 01:07:06,846
...though they were innocent.
I won't rest...

583
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,808
Do not say that you were innocent.

584
01:07:09,016 --> 01:07:12,167
-Would it do any good to say it again?
-No.

585
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:17,293
Consider my offer carefully. You will
never escape while we are victorious.

586
01:07:17,496 --> 01:07:21,535
If we are not, you will sink
with this ship, chained to your oar.

587
01:07:21,856 --> 01:07:24,575
I cannot believe that
God has let me live these years...

588
01:07:24,776 --> 01:07:26,448
...to die chained to an oar.

589
01:07:26,656 --> 01:07:30,126
It's a strange, stubborn faith
you keep...

590
01:07:30,336 --> 01:07:33,089
...to believe that
existence has a purpose.

591
01:07:33,296 --> 01:07:37,335
A sane man would have learned
to lose it long before this.

592
01:07:37,536 --> 01:07:38,969
As you have.

593
01:07:39,776 --> 01:07:41,687
What drove it out of you?

594
01:07:43,136 --> 01:07:45,650
Go back to your oar, 41.

595
01:08:01,536 --> 01:08:03,492
Consul, enemy sighted.

596
01:08:04,536 --> 01:08:06,891
Signal the fleet.
Prepare for battle.

597
01:08:13,496 --> 01:08:16,169
All the watch to battle posts.

598
01:08:20,896 --> 01:08:22,966
-Stand by to load.
-Make ready to fire.

599
01:08:23,176 --> 01:08:24,529
Hurry, quick!

600
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:29,609
Hurry up with that resin.
Get some more ammunition.

601
01:08:34,976 --> 01:08:37,012
Raise oars!

602
01:08:38,176 --> 01:08:40,451
Down oars!

603
01:08:40,776 --> 01:08:41,731
Chain rowers!

604
01:09:03,736 --> 01:09:04,964
Guard.

605
01:09:07,536 --> 01:09:08,969
Unlock 41.

606
01:09:09,416 --> 01:09:11,532
No! I don't want to die!

607
01:09:11,736 --> 01:09:13,454
I don't want to die!

608
01:09:42,696 --> 01:09:45,733
41, why did he do that?

609
01:09:46,496 --> 01:09:47,849
I don't know.

610
01:09:50,496 --> 01:09:53,374
Once before, a man helped me.

611
01:09:54,256 --> 01:09:56,247
I didn't know why then.

612
01:09:57,616 --> 01:10:00,767
Normal speed!

613
01:10:35,456 --> 01:10:37,572
Number 1, flame.

614
01:10:38,656 --> 01:10:39,611
Fire.

615
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:52,805
Fire!

616
01:10:53,496 --> 01:10:54,451
Fire!

617
01:10:59,936 --> 01:11:01,813
Hold withdrawal on command.

618
01:11:03,256 --> 01:11:05,929
Lift oars! Raise!

619
01:11:06,336 --> 01:11:08,054
Withdraw!

620
01:11:10,536 --> 01:11:11,571
Steersman, right.

621
01:11:19,056 --> 01:11:20,694
Extend oars!

622
01:11:22,336 --> 01:11:23,485
Fire!

623
01:11:44,136 --> 01:11:45,615
-Watch out!
-Fire!

624
01:12:01,576 --> 01:12:04,454
Steersman, ram course! Order below!

625
01:12:04,656 --> 01:12:06,806
-Ramming speed!
-Ramming speed!

626
01:12:17,776 --> 01:12:20,210
Consul, barge on ramming course.

627
01:12:27,496 --> 01:12:30,966
We're going to be rammed!
We're going to be rammed!

628
01:17:13,976 --> 01:17:15,329
Why did you save me?

629
01:17:18,016 --> 01:17:20,450
Why did you have me unchained?

630
01:17:40,296 --> 01:17:42,730
What is your name, 41?

631
01:17:44,896 --> 01:17:46,409
Judah Ben-Hur.

632
01:17:47,376 --> 01:17:49,207
Judah Ben-Hur...

633
01:17:50,776 --> 01:17:52,050
...let me die.

634
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:58,327
We keep you alive to serve this ship.

635
01:17:58,736 --> 01:18:00,215
Row well and live.

636
01:18:15,536 --> 01:18:16,764
Is the sail square?

637
01:18:18,696 --> 01:18:20,527
I can't tell.

638
01:18:21,936 --> 01:18:24,370
Better for us both if it's the enemy.

639
01:18:25,736 --> 01:18:26,771
My death.

640
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:28,974
Your freedom.

641
01:18:33,456 --> 01:18:35,492
It's a Roman sail.

642
01:19:04,056 --> 01:19:05,455
Face rear!

643
01:19:05,656 --> 01:19:09,535
Welcome, consul.
We had given up all hope for you.

644
01:19:12,776 --> 01:19:13,891
Water.

645
01:19:18,176 --> 01:19:20,053
The fleet, all lost?

646
01:19:20,296 --> 01:19:21,854
Five galleys.

647
01:19:22,456 --> 01:19:25,653
-And the battle?
-The battle was won.

648
01:19:26,016 --> 01:19:27,335
You have a victory.

649
01:19:28,296 --> 01:19:30,810
-It was a victory?
-Complete.

650
01:19:48,736 --> 01:19:50,886
In His eagerness to save you...

651
01:19:51,136 --> 01:19:54,606
...your God has also saved
the Roman fleet.

652
01:20:27,696 --> 01:20:30,210
Hail Arrius!

653
01:20:32,656 --> 01:20:34,692
Right oars!

654
01:23:21,016 --> 01:23:25,373
You have cleared the seaways
of a great danger, Quintus Arrius.

655
01:23:26,216 --> 01:23:29,526
This baton of victory
has been nobly won.

656
01:23:37,056 --> 01:23:39,934
This man riding beside you, who is he?

657
01:23:40,336 --> 01:23:43,294
The man who saved me, divine emperor,
to return and serve you.

658
01:23:43,496 --> 01:23:45,452
Is that all you know about him?

659
01:23:47,816 --> 01:23:52,412
No. He was accused of an attack
on the governor of Judea.

660
01:23:52,616 --> 01:23:54,413
But he was innocent.

661
01:23:54,616 --> 01:23:57,289
If not, there's a strange
inconsistency in this man...

662
01:23:57,496 --> 01:24:01,728
...who tries to kill my governor,
yet saves the life of my consul.

663
01:24:02,656 --> 01:24:05,489
Come tomorrow. We'll talk of it.

664
01:24:33,976 --> 01:24:36,774
We have all the information
on this man...

665
01:24:36,976 --> 01:24:39,331
...a man of some influence
in his own country.

666
01:24:39,696 --> 01:24:43,689
His attack upon our governor is one
upon the senate and the people of Rome.

667
01:24:43,896 --> 01:24:46,649
I am convinced that
no such attack was intended.

668
01:24:47,056 --> 01:24:50,332
Consul, allow us to continue.

669
01:24:51,456 --> 01:24:53,765
Allow us to be generous.

670
01:24:54,936 --> 01:24:58,053
As a reward to you
for your great victory...

671
01:24:58,376 --> 01:25:01,925
...we shall not send him back to
the galleys. Take him as your slave.

672
01:25:06,296 --> 01:25:08,491
Such is the will of the senate...

673
01:25:09,296 --> 01:25:11,173
...and the people of Rome.

674
01:26:28,496 --> 01:26:30,646
Not long ago, I returned to Rome...

675
01:26:30,856 --> 01:26:33,529
...with a young man
who had saved my life.

676
01:26:33,736 --> 01:26:36,808
You all know him as
the finest charioteer in Rome.

677
01:26:37,016 --> 01:26:40,372
Five times, he's driven
my horses to victory.

678
01:26:46,456 --> 01:26:50,927
I know him as one who stands
in the place of the son I lost.

679
01:26:51,936 --> 01:26:54,496
I have the love and pride
in a son's achievements...

680
01:26:54,936 --> 01:26:57,006
...which I thought
I should never have again.

681
01:27:02,256 --> 01:27:04,292
Nothing could make stronger
our bond...

682
01:27:04,496 --> 01:27:06,930
...but tonight I wish
to share it with you all.

683
01:27:08,056 --> 01:27:11,844
The formalities of adoption
have been completed.

684
01:27:12,056 --> 01:27:15,093
Young Arrius is now
the legal bearer of my name...

685
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,412
...and the heir to my property.

686
01:27:21,856 --> 01:27:24,165
This ring of my ancestors...

687
01:27:24,736 --> 01:27:26,692
...would have gone to my son.

688
01:27:28,016 --> 01:27:30,576
So now it is yours.

689
01:27:50,736 --> 01:27:55,287
It's a strange destiny that
brought me to a new life...

690
01:27:56,056 --> 01:27:57,569
...a new home...

691
01:27:58,496 --> 01:27:59,929
...a new father.

692
01:28:01,376 --> 01:28:03,412
It brought me here.

693
01:28:04,056 --> 01:28:05,967
It may take me away.

694
01:28:06,736 --> 01:28:08,454
But wherever I may be...

695
01:28:08,696 --> 01:28:12,689
...I shall always try to wear this ring
as a son of Arrius should.

696
01:28:13,216 --> 01:28:16,208
With gratitude and affection...

697
01:28:17,416 --> 01:28:18,690
...and with honor.

698
01:28:37,496 --> 01:28:39,930
My old friend Pontius Pilate,
young Arrius.

699
01:28:40,176 --> 01:28:43,213
Before you came to this city,
my horses always won.

700
01:28:43,416 --> 01:28:45,327
Magnificent horses, extremely swift.

701
01:28:45,536 --> 01:28:47,731
Yes, but not swift enough
to defeat you.

702
01:28:47,936 --> 01:28:50,291
-Tell me, you come from Judea?
-Yes, sir.

703
01:28:50,496 --> 01:28:53,169
I hear that the climate
is difficult to live in.

704
01:28:53,376 --> 01:28:55,207
Not for Judeans.

705
01:28:58,696 --> 01:29:01,893
It's a terrible prospect.
I am to be made governor.

706
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:03,808
-Of Judea?
-Yes.

707
01:29:04,016 --> 01:29:05,415
I asked for Alexandria.

708
01:29:05,616 --> 01:29:08,369
But it seems the wilderness
needs my particular talents.

709
01:29:08,576 --> 01:29:11,534
The scorpions and holy prophets
can't get on without me.

710
01:29:11,736 --> 01:29:15,046
Lay the dust of Judea,
at least for this evening.

711
01:29:15,296 --> 01:29:17,605
Goats and Jehovah.

712
01:29:35,376 --> 01:29:36,695
You're leaving.

713
01:29:39,736 --> 01:29:41,169
I must.

714
01:29:42,496 --> 01:29:44,851
It's a journey I can't keep you from.

715
01:29:46,336 --> 01:29:50,614
Your eyes have never left it all
these months. I can recognize pain.

716
01:29:50,816 --> 01:29:54,411
But still, my counsel is to wait.

717
01:29:54,616 --> 01:29:56,971
Gratus is to be replaced.

718
01:29:57,216 --> 01:30:00,253
The governorship goes
to Pontius Pilate.

719
01:30:03,936 --> 01:30:05,005
When?

720
01:30:05,496 --> 01:30:06,895
Very soon.

721
01:30:07,456 --> 01:30:09,651
It's very much to our purpose.

722
01:30:10,776 --> 01:30:15,167
Nothing is to the purpose if, when
I come back to Judea, I come too late.

723
01:30:18,216 --> 01:30:22,289
That is the thought which has punished
me every moment I've spent here.

724
01:30:28,976 --> 01:30:31,171
Will Rome see you again?

725
01:30:38,016 --> 01:30:41,406
Here is a part of my life
which you have made for me.

726
01:30:42,936 --> 01:30:44,688
I shall remember it.

727
01:30:47,776 --> 01:30:52,008
Whoever the gods are, they take
small interest in an old man's hopes.

728
01:30:52,896 --> 01:30:54,249
They have their way.

729
01:32:30,896 --> 01:32:32,329
Forgive me.

730
01:32:32,696 --> 01:32:34,812
You're a stranger here.

731
01:32:36,016 --> 01:32:38,325
Would you be from Nazareth?

732
01:32:40,496 --> 01:32:41,849
Why do you ask?

733
01:32:42,336 --> 01:32:43,291
I thought...

734
01:32:44,856 --> 01:32:47,051
...you might be the one...

735
01:32:48,976 --> 01:32:52,412
The one that I have come back
from my country to find.

736
01:32:56,216 --> 01:32:58,571
He would be about your age.

737
01:32:59,696 --> 01:33:00,492
Who?

738
01:33:04,056 --> 01:33:05,808
When I find Him...

739
01:33:07,136 --> 01:33:08,615
...I shall know Him.

740
01:33:13,736 --> 01:33:16,967
Oh, but forgive me.
I am Balthasar of Alexandria.

741
01:33:17,216 --> 01:33:19,571
I am the guest of Sheik Ilderim.

742
01:33:20,416 --> 01:33:22,134
Sack of flesh without brains!

743
01:33:22,336 --> 01:33:24,975
No! No! Not the whip!

744
01:33:26,496 --> 01:33:27,531
That is my host.

745
01:33:27,736 --> 01:33:28,851
Gently! Gently!

746
01:33:29,456 --> 01:33:32,812
Fool! Headless toad!
You know nothing of horses!

747
01:33:33,016 --> 01:33:36,247
Whip my children once and
I'll drain every drop of your blood.

748
01:33:36,456 --> 01:33:40,415
Now, gently around the first turn,
and let them run! Go on!

749
01:33:45,416 --> 01:33:48,772
Keep my words in your head!
Let us see some wisdom!

750
01:33:49,576 --> 01:33:50,770
Beautiful horses.

751
01:34:01,976 --> 01:34:04,331
Now! Now! They are ready!
Let them go!

752
01:34:10,816 --> 01:34:13,171
Watch. They'll never hold the turn.

753
01:34:15,256 --> 01:34:17,724
No! No!

754
01:34:19,496 --> 01:34:21,566
Abadon, stop him!

755
01:34:23,496 --> 01:34:24,815
Stop that whip!

756
01:34:25,016 --> 01:34:26,927
I'll kill him! I'll kill...!

757
01:34:32,216 --> 01:34:35,253
Moonhead!
Give me those reins, you fool!

758
01:34:38,216 --> 01:34:40,855
You think you can treat
my horses like animals?!

759
01:34:42,296 --> 01:34:45,015
Drive cows and goats!
That's all you're fit for!

760
01:34:45,256 --> 01:34:46,769
Get off, idiot!

761
01:34:51,896 --> 01:34:53,409
Drive goats, not horses!

762
01:34:53,616 --> 01:34:55,686
I am doomed.
You saw what happened here?

763
01:34:55,896 --> 01:34:59,013
This traveler told what would happen
before it happened.

764
01:35:00,856 --> 01:35:03,689
Your horses are very fine,
but they're not a team.

765
01:35:03,896 --> 01:35:05,249
Not a team?

766
01:35:05,456 --> 01:35:08,175
But one of them held steady,
the one on the outside.

767
01:35:08,376 --> 01:35:10,571
-Antares.
-The slow one?

768
01:35:10,776 --> 01:35:14,928
He should run on the inside where
he can steady the others in the turns.

769
01:35:20,456 --> 01:35:23,732
You have a keen eye.
Where did you acquire it?

770
01:35:23,936 --> 01:35:25,733
In the circus in Rome.

771
01:35:27,696 --> 01:35:30,164
You have driven in the great circus?

772
01:35:31,816 --> 01:35:35,968
Tell me, my friend, could you
make my four run as one?

773
01:35:36,216 --> 01:35:37,695
I'm on my way to Jerusalem.

774
01:35:37,896 --> 01:35:39,887
Would your caravan rest until tomorrow?

775
01:35:40,136 --> 01:35:42,127
We have time enough
to eat, drink and talk.

776
01:35:42,336 --> 01:35:44,406
Come into my tent
and refresh yourself.

777
01:35:44,616 --> 01:35:47,847
And let me hear how you raced in Rome.

778
01:35:49,656 --> 01:35:53,444
If I had a voice to sing,
I would sing you the psalm of horses.

779
01:35:53,656 --> 01:35:56,216
No other animal has
descended so in scale...

780
01:35:56,416 --> 01:35:58,884
...from the first innocent falling
of the world.

781
01:35:59,896 --> 01:36:03,491
And tomorrow, I shall put Antares
on the inside.

782
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:07,006
When you do, shorten the yoke.
It will help them in the turns.

783
01:36:07,496 --> 01:36:09,407
Judah Ben-Hur.

784
01:36:09,616 --> 01:36:12,335
You're a Jew,
yet you drove in the great circus.

785
01:36:12,536 --> 01:36:13,651
Yes.

786
01:36:15,176 --> 01:36:19,010
By a strange choice
and a stranger fortune.

787
01:36:19,816 --> 01:36:22,330
Your coming here was so fit, so right.

788
01:36:22,536 --> 01:36:25,004
We might have achieved wonders!

789
01:36:25,216 --> 01:36:26,968
You have to go.

790
01:36:31,216 --> 01:36:33,172
I make a journey which will not wait.

791
01:36:33,376 --> 01:36:35,606
Ah, well, then perhaps
you will come back.

792
01:36:35,816 --> 01:36:38,125
And when you do,
bring your friends, your wives.

793
01:36:38,336 --> 01:36:39,974
I have no wives.

794
01:36:40,216 --> 01:36:42,047
No wives at all?

795
01:36:42,376 --> 01:36:44,571
I have six, no, seven.

796
01:36:44,776 --> 01:36:46,368
I've counted eight.

797
01:36:46,656 --> 01:36:49,728
And that is because he is traveling.
At home, he has more.

798
01:36:49,936 --> 01:36:53,167
Believe me, it is a great advantage
to have many wives.

799
01:36:53,376 --> 01:36:55,936
-Someday, I hope to have one.
-One wife!

800
01:36:56,176 --> 01:37:00,374
One God, that I can understand.
But one wife, that is not civilized.

801
01:37:00,696 --> 01:37:02,573
It is not generous.

802
01:37:07,616 --> 01:37:11,211
-Was the food not to your liking?
-Indeed.

803
01:37:22,696 --> 01:37:24,527
Thank you. Thank you.

804
01:37:24,736 --> 01:37:29,207
And take my advice, my friend.
Buy yourself some wives.

805
01:37:30,376 --> 01:37:33,812
And now I must say good night
to my beauties.

806
01:37:34,456 --> 01:37:37,129
When ready for sleep,
they get impatient and jealous.

807
01:37:37,336 --> 01:37:40,055
They wait to see which one
I will embrace first.

808
01:37:40,576 --> 01:37:42,806
-I'll make my farewells then.
-No, no, no, stay.

809
01:37:43,016 --> 01:37:44,893
Stay and see them.

810
01:37:58,216 --> 01:38:01,014
Come, my children. Come.

811
01:38:06,856 --> 01:38:08,448
Strangers make them shy.

812
01:38:09,736 --> 01:38:10,612
Come.

813
01:38:11,056 --> 01:38:13,775
Come, do not be afraid. Come.

814
01:38:19,336 --> 01:38:21,292
There, my children.

815
01:38:21,616 --> 01:38:24,335
They are descended from
the Arabians of the Pharaohs...

816
01:38:24,536 --> 01:38:26,766
...and I have named them
for the stars.

817
01:38:28,416 --> 01:38:29,929
Come, Antares.

818
01:38:30,176 --> 01:38:33,566
You are the slowest, and you can
run all day without tiring.

819
01:38:33,776 --> 01:38:36,210
What? Yes, yes.

820
01:38:36,416 --> 01:38:40,045
Yes, I love you too.
There's my good Antares.

821
01:38:40,296 --> 01:38:41,445
Come, Rigel.

822
01:38:41,656 --> 01:38:45,205
We've both supped well,
and the world is good.

823
01:38:45,576 --> 01:38:46,725
There's my good Rigel.

824
01:38:48,896 --> 01:38:51,126
Yes, you are ready for sleep.

825
01:38:52,376 --> 01:38:54,765
The day's work done for you, eh?

826
01:38:56,016 --> 01:38:58,291
Yes, well, you can go
to sleep in a minute.

827
01:38:58,536 --> 01:39:00,845
Good night. Good night, my treasure.

828
01:39:02,896 --> 01:39:05,968
Steady, Aldebaran.
I haven't forgotten you.

829
01:39:06,216 --> 01:39:09,731
No. You are the swiftest,
but you must be steady.

830
01:39:12,176 --> 01:39:14,451
Never seen finer horses, even in Rome.

831
01:39:14,656 --> 01:39:16,567
You should see their mother, Mira.

832
01:39:16,776 --> 01:39:19,688
I dare not bring her.
My people couldn't bear her absence.

833
01:39:19,896 --> 01:39:21,773
All right, all right.

834
01:39:25,976 --> 01:39:29,605
You are their friend, and they do
not give their affections readily.

835
01:39:30,336 --> 01:39:33,772
Come, Antares, Rigel, it is late.

836
01:39:34,536 --> 01:39:38,609
Altair, Aldebaran, go to sleep.

837
01:39:39,336 --> 01:39:41,725
You must be strong and swift.

838
01:39:41,936 --> 01:39:44,291
Go, my children. Go.

839
01:39:48,496 --> 01:39:51,454
At Jerusalem, they'll race
the world's finest teams...

840
01:39:51,656 --> 01:39:55,251
...and the champion of the East,
Messala, with his black devils.

841
01:39:55,456 --> 01:39:57,048
He stops at nothing to win.

842
01:39:57,296 --> 01:40:00,015
-Messala? In the circus?
-Yes.

843
01:40:00,216 --> 01:40:01,808
You knew him?

844
01:40:02,856 --> 01:40:04,005
I know him.

845
01:40:04,376 --> 01:40:06,492
Perhaps without much liking.

846
01:40:09,896 --> 01:40:11,614
My people are praying for a man...

847
01:40:11,816 --> 01:40:14,250
...to drive their team
to victory over Messala.

848
01:40:14,456 --> 01:40:16,492
You could be that man, the one...

849
01:40:16,696 --> 01:40:18,732
...to stamp his arrogance
into the sand.

850
01:40:18,936 --> 01:40:21,928
My horses need only a driver
who is worthy of them...

851
01:40:22,176 --> 01:40:25,646
...one who will rule them with love.
For him, they'd outrace the wind.

852
01:40:25,856 --> 01:40:27,528
It's not possible.

853
01:40:28,776 --> 01:40:30,334
That is a pity.

854
01:40:31,296 --> 01:40:33,252
Think of it. To break his pride...

855
01:40:33,456 --> 01:40:36,812
...to humble this tribune before
the very people he has degraded.

856
01:40:37,016 --> 01:40:41,373
Just think, his defeat and humiliation
at the hands of a Jew!

857
01:40:41,976 --> 01:40:44,046
I know it is not possible.

858
01:40:44,416 --> 01:40:47,055
Does it not delight your imagination?

859
01:40:48,456 --> 01:40:50,686
Does it not answer your purpose?

860
01:40:51,696 --> 01:40:53,812
I must deal with Messala
in my own way.

861
01:40:54,456 --> 01:40:56,526
And your way is to kill him.

862
01:41:00,176 --> 01:41:02,929
I see this terrible thing
in your eyes.

863
01:41:03,296 --> 01:41:07,335
But no matter what this man has done,
you have no right to kill him.

864
01:41:07,736 --> 01:41:10,011
He will be punished inevitably.

865
01:41:11,056 --> 01:41:12,614
I don't believe in miracles.

866
01:41:13,616 --> 01:41:15,447
But all life is a miracle.

867
01:41:15,656 --> 01:41:17,886
Why will you not
accept God's judgment?

868
01:41:20,656 --> 01:41:22,487
You do not believe in miracles.

869
01:41:23,336 --> 01:41:26,248
Yet God once spoke to me
out of the darkness...

870
01:41:26,456 --> 01:41:29,016
...and a star led me
to a village called Bethlehem...

871
01:41:29,216 --> 01:41:32,174
...where I found a newborn child
in a manger.

872
01:41:32,376 --> 01:41:34,173
And God lived in this child.

873
01:41:35,256 --> 01:41:38,965
By now, He is a grown man
and must be ready to begin his work.

874
01:41:39,216 --> 01:41:40,808
That is why I have returned here...

875
01:41:41,016 --> 01:41:43,689
...so that I may be at hand
when He comes among us.

876
01:41:45,816 --> 01:41:47,329
He is near.

877
01:41:48,296 --> 01:41:51,766
He saw the sun set this evening,
as we did.

878
01:41:52,296 --> 01:41:56,050
Perhaps He's standing in a doorway
somewhere or on a hilltop.

879
01:41:56,696 --> 01:41:58,766
Perhaps He is a shepherd...

880
01:41:58,976 --> 01:42:01,729
...a merchant, a fisherman.

881
01:42:02,216 --> 01:42:03,854
But He lives...

882
01:42:04,056 --> 01:42:08,208
...and all our lives from now on
will carry His mark.

883
01:42:10,296 --> 01:42:12,935
There are many paths to God, my son.

884
01:42:14,016 --> 01:42:16,166
I hope yours will not
be too difficult.

885
01:42:26,576 --> 01:42:28,328
I'm ready for sleep.

886
01:42:42,176 --> 01:42:44,485
Balthasar is a good man...

887
01:42:44,696 --> 01:42:48,769
...but until all men are like him,
we must keep our swords bright.

888
01:42:49,056 --> 01:42:51,047
And our intention true.

889
01:42:52,176 --> 01:42:53,848
So I must leave you.

890
01:42:55,976 --> 01:42:57,773
One last thought.

891
01:42:57,976 --> 01:43:00,570
There is no law in the arena.

892
01:43:01,416 --> 01:43:03,168
Many are killed.

893
01:43:05,816 --> 01:43:07,090
I hope to see you again.

894
01:43:22,416 --> 01:43:24,691
Fine Damascus silk.

895
01:43:24,976 --> 01:43:27,206
Fine Damascus silk.

896
01:45:29,136 --> 01:45:30,455
Esther?

897
01:45:41,536 --> 01:45:43,208
It's Judah.

898
01:45:51,136 --> 01:45:52,967
You are alive.

899
01:45:53,976 --> 01:45:56,126
You are alive.

900
01:45:57,816 --> 01:46:01,604
What are you doing here?
What has happened?

901
01:46:10,656 --> 01:46:11,930
I'm here.

902
01:46:13,816 --> 01:46:14,931
I'm with you.

903
01:46:21,176 --> 01:46:22,768
Where's your father?

904
01:46:27,576 --> 01:46:31,251
The day they took you away,
they imprisoned him.

905
01:46:31,696 --> 01:46:33,414
They tortured him.

906
01:46:33,856 --> 01:46:38,213
When they were sure he was hiding
nothing, they let him go.

907
01:46:39,616 --> 01:46:44,167
Ever since then, we have been
living here, in hiding.

908
01:46:44,776 --> 01:46:46,892
You never went back to Antioch?

909
01:46:47,256 --> 01:46:48,371
No.

910
01:46:48,616 --> 01:46:52,848
The Romans took everything.
There was nothing left for us there.

911
01:46:59,136 --> 01:47:01,013
Where are my mother and sister?

912
01:47:10,256 --> 01:47:12,212
Let me tell him first.

913
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:31,125
Father.

914
01:47:32,336 --> 01:47:34,930
Father, something wonderful
has happened.

915
01:47:36,216 --> 01:47:38,207
Judah Ben-Hur is alive.

916
01:47:39,576 --> 01:47:42,773
He has come home. He is here.

917
01:47:59,736 --> 01:48:01,010
Judah.

918
01:48:02,776 --> 01:48:05,006
Judah Ben-Hur.

919
01:48:07,576 --> 01:48:09,646
My dear old friend.

920
01:48:11,576 --> 01:48:13,453
Let me look at you.

921
01:48:13,976 --> 01:48:15,455
Let me see you.

922
01:48:16,816 --> 01:48:19,649
Yes, yes. It is true.

923
01:48:20,376 --> 01:48:23,812
Praise God for His mercy.

924
01:48:44,496 --> 01:48:45,815
Where are they?

925
01:48:46,976 --> 01:48:50,048
Since that terrible day...

926
01:48:50,936 --> 01:48:53,370
...there has been no word of them.

927
01:49:08,576 --> 01:49:10,487
You should have been less loyal.

928
01:49:10,696 --> 01:49:12,607
Do not pity me, Master Judah.

929
01:49:12,816 --> 01:49:15,728
In fact, I'm twice the man I was.

930
01:49:17,216 --> 01:49:21,175
There is Malluch, my other half.
We met in the dungeons of the citadel.

931
01:49:21,376 --> 01:49:23,367
We were released on the same day.

932
01:49:23,576 --> 01:49:28,206
Malluch without a tongue,
and I without life in my legs.

933
01:49:28,416 --> 01:49:30,725
Since then, I have been his tongue...

934
01:49:30,936 --> 01:49:32,528
...and he has been my legs.

935
01:49:32,736 --> 01:49:35,808
Together, we make a considerable man.

936
01:49:37,656 --> 01:49:39,214
Old friend.

937
01:49:40,616 --> 01:49:43,289
She always said you would return.

938
01:49:43,496 --> 01:49:45,726
She never gave up hope.

939
01:49:47,736 --> 01:49:50,204
Though I hoped it,
I didn't believe it.

940
01:49:51,456 --> 01:49:55,131
I see that your one thought is
to save your mother and sister.

941
01:49:56,416 --> 01:49:58,611
But suppose that isn't possible.

942
01:49:58,816 --> 01:50:01,284
If one purpose fails,
it is good to have another.

943
01:50:02,176 --> 01:50:04,212
Much of your fortune is safe, Judah.

944
01:50:04,416 --> 01:50:07,214
They could not make me
tell them where it is.

945
01:50:07,416 --> 01:50:08,485
It is there still...

946
01:50:08,696 --> 01:50:11,972
...to put power into our hands
and buy death for the Romans.

947
01:50:15,136 --> 01:50:17,366
That's not why I came back.

948
01:50:17,616 --> 01:50:20,414
Judah, they are dead.

949
01:50:20,816 --> 01:50:25,287
Four years. No one could live
so long in the dungeons.

950
01:50:29,856 --> 01:50:32,654
Who lives more than one year
in the galleys?

951
01:50:33,336 --> 01:50:35,452
Yes, it is true.

952
01:50:37,696 --> 01:50:40,415
Judah Ben-Hur.

953
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:46,571
You have come back to us
like a returning faith.

954
01:50:46,776 --> 01:50:49,768
Judah, I should like to laugh again.

955
01:50:49,976 --> 01:50:51,250
-Let us laugh.
-We will.

956
01:50:51,456 --> 01:50:53,253
There will be joy again
in this house.

957
01:50:53,456 --> 01:50:56,289
We will celebrate among the dust.

958
01:51:08,736 --> 01:51:10,135
I will take him.

959
01:51:40,416 --> 01:51:42,293
We stood here before.

960
01:51:45,416 --> 01:51:47,372
A long while ago.

961
01:51:48,456 --> 01:51:49,809
Four years.

962
01:51:53,536 --> 01:51:55,254
But now it seems as if...

963
01:51:55,856 --> 01:51:57,687
...only yesterday....

964
01:51:59,536 --> 01:52:00,969
I was saying:

965
01:52:03,136 --> 01:52:06,731
"If you were not a bride,
I should kiss you goodbye. "

966
01:52:08,696 --> 01:52:10,732
"If I were not a bride...

967
01:52:10,936 --> 01:52:13,609
...there would be
no goodbyes to be said. "

968
01:52:23,896 --> 01:52:25,648
I am not a bride.

969
01:52:56,296 --> 01:52:58,446
Why did you never marry?

970
01:53:00,536 --> 01:53:02,254
My father needed me.

971
01:53:06,816 --> 01:53:08,135
And also....

972
01:53:16,696 --> 01:53:18,607
It's still on my finger.

973
01:53:20,856 --> 01:53:25,407
I said I should wear it
till I met a woman I would marry.

974
01:53:32,056 --> 01:53:34,616
It's become a part of my hand.

975
01:53:43,056 --> 01:53:45,968
If Messala once knew you were here....

976
01:53:46,416 --> 01:53:47,769
As he must.

977
01:53:48,336 --> 01:53:50,213
He will know where they are.

978
01:53:57,936 --> 01:53:59,608
And if you should find...?

979
01:54:02,256 --> 01:54:05,805
-If he says they're dead...
-Messala will wish they were living.

980
01:54:11,136 --> 01:54:14,253
I've seen too much
of what hate can do.

981
01:54:14,816 --> 01:54:16,932
My father is burned up with it.

982
01:54:18,936 --> 01:54:23,373
But I've heard of a young rabbi who
says that forgiveness is greater...

983
01:54:23,576 --> 01:54:26,295
...and love more powerful than hatred.

984
01:54:27,376 --> 01:54:28,809
I believe it.

985
01:54:29,416 --> 01:54:31,247
-Esther.
-Judah.

986
01:54:31,776 --> 01:54:33,368
Stay alive.

987
01:54:33,936 --> 01:54:35,813
Keep away from Messala.

988
01:54:36,056 --> 01:54:38,775
Only if I can give up
thinking and feeling.

989
01:54:40,816 --> 01:54:42,727
That time isn't yet come.

990
01:54:42,936 --> 01:54:47,248
The stone that fell from this roof
so long ago is still falling.

991
01:54:47,736 --> 01:54:50,330
Only this time you won't be sent
to the galleys.

992
01:54:50,536 --> 01:54:52,652
This time you will be destroyed.

993
01:54:52,856 --> 01:54:54,335
You'll die.

994
01:55:36,376 --> 01:55:39,766
Tribune, compliments of Quintus
Arrius. He awaits your pleasure.

995
01:55:39,976 --> 01:55:42,536
-Consul here?
-Quintus Arrius, the younger tribune.

996
01:55:42,736 --> 01:55:44,727
Thank him. Bring him to me.

997
01:55:45,536 --> 01:55:50,610
-I didn't know the consul had a son.
-He's a champion of the great circus.

998
01:55:50,936 --> 01:55:52,289
Why is he presenting me with gifts?

999
01:55:54,376 --> 01:55:56,651
-Perhaps he'll race against you.
-Look.

1000
01:55:58,496 --> 01:56:00,134
It's magnificent.

1001
01:56:00,336 --> 01:56:02,167
And from a man I've never met.

1002
01:56:02,376 --> 01:56:04,332
You're wrong, Messala.

1003
01:56:27,896 --> 01:56:30,774
By what magic do you bear
the name of a consul of Rome?

1004
01:56:32,056 --> 01:56:34,251
You were the magician, Messala.

1005
01:56:34,456 --> 01:56:36,651
You condemned me to the galleys.

1006
01:56:37,376 --> 01:56:40,049
When my ship was sunk,
I saved the consul's life.

1007
01:56:51,776 --> 01:56:53,334
You know his seal?

1008
01:57:04,856 --> 01:57:06,687
Now I have come back...

1009
01:57:06,976 --> 01:57:09,251
...as I swore I would.

1010
01:57:14,536 --> 01:57:18,575
Your gift is exquisitely
appropriate, young Arrius.

1011
01:57:19,576 --> 01:57:22,170
You suggest I use it on myself?

1012
01:57:23,616 --> 01:57:27,325
What has become of
my mother and my sister?

1013
01:57:30,936 --> 01:57:33,848
It is not my duty
to keep track of prisoners.

1014
01:57:34,496 --> 01:57:35,770
Find them, Messala.

1015
01:57:37,216 --> 01:57:39,650
Restore them to me,
and I'll forget what I vowed...

1016
01:57:39,856 --> 01:57:43,246
...with every stroke of that oar
you chained me to.

1017
01:57:46,696 --> 01:57:49,654
I am not the governor.
I can do nothing without approval.

1018
01:57:49,856 --> 01:57:50,811
Then get it.

1019
01:57:55,576 --> 01:57:57,692
I will come back tomorrow.

1020
01:57:58,576 --> 01:58:01,249
Don't disappoint me, Messala.

1021
01:58:15,536 --> 01:58:17,128
What became of them?

1022
01:58:17,416 --> 01:58:20,806
It's been almost five years.
Do you suppose they're still alive?

1023
01:58:21,016 --> 01:58:23,530
Go to the citadel, Drusus. Find out.

1024
01:58:23,736 --> 01:58:25,852
-And if they're dead?
-They're dead!

1025
01:58:40,216 --> 01:58:43,174
"Miriam, wife. Tirzah, daughter. "

1026
01:58:43,376 --> 01:58:45,810
Yes, they are the ones.
Are they alive?

1027
01:58:46,256 --> 01:58:47,575
E section...

1028
01:58:48,816 --> 01:58:50,249
...lower level.

1029
01:58:51,336 --> 01:58:54,453
Cell two.
Jailer on that level will know.

1030
01:59:11,416 --> 01:59:12,531
Water.

1031
01:59:13,056 --> 01:59:14,125
Water.

1032
01:59:14,736 --> 01:59:15,964
Let me out!

1033
01:59:50,136 --> 01:59:52,889
-How long since you've seen them?
-Never.

1034
01:59:53,136 --> 01:59:57,015
And I've been here three years.
But they're alive all right.

1035
02:00:00,136 --> 02:00:01,774
The food disappears.

1036
02:00:34,816 --> 02:00:36,135
Lepers.

1037
02:01:04,216 --> 02:01:06,969
They must be taken outside the city
and released at once.

1038
02:01:07,216 --> 02:01:08,774
Then we'll burn out the cell.

1039
02:01:53,656 --> 02:01:55,135
Is someone there?

1040
02:02:00,536 --> 02:02:02,572
There is someone there.

1041
02:02:15,376 --> 02:02:16,570
Who are you?

1042
02:02:19,576 --> 02:02:21,294
Don't come any closer.

1043
02:02:24,456 --> 02:02:25,411
Who are you?

1044
02:02:28,696 --> 02:02:29,651
Esther.

1045
02:02:31,576 --> 02:02:32,850
It's Miriam.

1046
02:02:33,376 --> 02:02:34,445
Miriam.

1047
02:02:36,696 --> 02:02:37,924
Miriam?

1048
02:02:40,496 --> 02:02:42,566
Stay where you are.

1049
02:02:44,696 --> 02:02:46,493
You have come home.

1050
02:02:48,176 --> 02:02:50,167
Stand back, Esther.

1051
02:02:58,496 --> 02:02:59,895
We are lepers.

1052
02:03:12,936 --> 02:03:14,494
Oh, Esther.

1053
02:03:16,336 --> 02:03:17,564
Tirzah.

1054
02:03:25,976 --> 02:03:27,375
Esther...

1055
02:03:29,056 --> 02:03:31,286
...is Judah living?

1056
02:03:32,056 --> 02:03:34,775
Yes, he is alive.

1057
02:03:35,536 --> 02:03:37,174
He is here.

1058
02:03:39,896 --> 02:03:40,851
Where?

1059
02:03:42,736 --> 02:03:46,012
He is searching for you now.

1060
02:03:46,336 --> 02:03:49,134
I must find him and tell him.

1061
02:03:49,336 --> 02:03:50,485
-No!
-Tell my father.

1062
02:03:50,696 --> 02:03:51,811
No.

1063
02:03:52,736 --> 02:03:54,374
Tell no one.

1064
02:03:56,976 --> 02:04:00,286
We are going away
to the Valley of the Lepers.

1065
02:04:00,696 --> 02:04:02,175
We won't return.

1066
02:04:05,256 --> 02:04:07,292
Judah has to be told.

1067
02:04:07,736 --> 02:04:08,691
No.

1068
02:04:11,616 --> 02:04:12,685
Please.

1069
02:04:31,216 --> 02:04:33,571
I couldn't see his face.

1070
02:04:35,296 --> 02:04:36,854
Is it changed?

1071
02:04:39,656 --> 02:04:42,614
No, he is not changed.

1072
02:04:48,056 --> 02:04:49,774
He's not changed.

1073
02:04:52,016 --> 02:04:54,007
You love him, Esther.

1074
02:05:04,696 --> 02:05:06,334
Promise me...

1075
02:05:06,936 --> 02:05:08,927
...on your love for him...

1076
02:05:10,136 --> 02:05:12,696
...you will never tell him
you've seen us.

1077
02:05:21,416 --> 02:05:23,293
Is he never to know?

1078
02:05:27,136 --> 02:05:29,604
Let him remember us as we were.

1079
02:05:31,136 --> 02:05:32,285
Promise me.

1080
02:05:42,536 --> 02:05:45,687
There's nothing else I can hope for.

1081
02:05:46,696 --> 02:05:48,288
Only this.

1082
02:05:55,136 --> 02:05:56,774
I promise.

1083
02:06:00,696 --> 02:06:02,368
I am content.

1084
02:06:20,976 --> 02:06:22,125
Wait.

1085
02:07:06,336 --> 02:07:08,372
Messala will find out.
I am sure of that.

1086
02:07:08,576 --> 02:07:12,489
I pray to God they're alive
and that Messala will free them.

1087
02:07:12,696 --> 02:07:14,493
He'll free them.

1088
02:07:14,696 --> 02:07:16,732
He wants to survive.

1089
02:07:18,176 --> 02:07:19,894
He cannot free them, Judah.

1090
02:07:23,616 --> 02:07:24,571
What do you mean?

1091
02:07:33,336 --> 02:07:34,325
I saw them.

1092
02:07:34,736 --> 02:07:36,328
You saw them?

1093
02:07:36,536 --> 02:07:37,651
Where?

1094
02:07:37,856 --> 02:07:39,448
When did you see them?

1095
02:07:44,856 --> 02:07:46,255
They were dead.

1096
02:07:48,736 --> 02:07:50,328
They were dead.

1097
02:07:52,376 --> 02:07:53,331
When?

1098
02:07:54,936 --> 02:07:57,211
When? When?!

1099
02:07:59,456 --> 02:08:00,809
In the prison.

1100
02:08:02,936 --> 02:08:05,689
When I was waiting
for news of my father.

1101
02:08:10,136 --> 02:08:11,854
Why didn't you tell me?

1102
02:08:17,336 --> 02:08:18,689
I couldn't tell you.

1103
02:08:19,896 --> 02:08:21,568
Nor even you, Father.

1104
02:08:23,176 --> 02:08:25,485
I was afraid that
if you saw Messala....

1105
02:08:26,256 --> 02:08:29,373
Judah, you have come
to the end of your search.

1106
02:08:29,576 --> 02:08:30,895
It's over now.

1107
02:08:31,376 --> 02:08:32,525
Over?

1108
02:08:33,416 --> 02:08:34,929
-Judah.
-Over?

1109
02:08:35,176 --> 02:08:39,249
Judah, forget, forget, forget Messala.
Go back to Rome.
