{285}{318}(gavel)
{321}{389}Silence. Be upstanding in court.
{392}{479}All persons who have|anything to do before my lords,
{482}{603}the queen's justices of oyer and terminer|and general jail delivery
{606}{686}for the jurisdiction|of the Central Criminal Court
{689}{800}draw near and give your attendance.|God save the queen.
{2942}{3040}What a beautiful day. I've been hoping|for a bit of sun for our homecoming.
{3043}{3189}It's worth having the fog just to appreciate|the sunshine. Is there a draught?
{3193}{3312}- Shall I roll up the window?|- Roll up your mouth. You talk too much.
{3315}{3399}If I'd known how much you talked|I'd never have come out of my coma.
{3403}{3458}- This thing weighs a ton.|- Now, now.
{3461}{3596}We've been flat on our back|for two months, we'd better be careful.
{3836}{3964}Lovely, lovely. It must be perfectly lovely|to live and work in the lnns of Court.
{3967}{4027}How lucky you lawyers are.
{4053}{4140}I almost married a lawyer.|I was in attendance for his appendectomy
{4144}{4209}and we became engaged|as soon as he could sit up.
{4212}{4285}And then peritonitis set in|and he went like that.
{4288}{4362}He certainly was a lucky lawyer.
{4646}{4739}Teeny-weeny steps, now. Remember|we had a teeny-weeny heart attack.
{4742}{4794}Oh, shut up!
{4797}{4846}Williams, my cane.
{4996}{5045}Here he comes!
{5314}{5411}Good afternoon. Thank you very much.|Everybody back to work.
{5414}{5513}Sir Wilfrid, if you don't mind, I'd like|to read you a poem to welcome you back.
{5516}{5616}Very touching. You can recite it|after office hours in your own time.
{5619}{5679}Now back to work.|What's the matter with you?
{5682}{5757}Nothing. I'm just happy|that you're your old self again.
{5760}{5861}Any more sentimentality around here,|I shall go back to the hospital!
{5864}{5950}They won't take him back.|He wasn't really discharged, you know,
{5953}{6034}he was expelled for conduct|unbecoming a cardiac patient.
{6037}{6148}Put these in water, blabbermouth!|Come on in, Carter.
{6277}{6386}Look at this room.|It's ugly, old and musty.
{6389}{6483}But I never knew|I could miss anything so much.
{6486}{6564}- Missed you too, you musty old buzzard.|- Oh, thank you, sir.
{6567}{6677}I'm not a religious man, but when they|carted you off, I went out and lit a candle.
{6680}{6770}- Why, thank you, Carter.|- Actually, sir, I was lighting it for myself.
{6774}{6865}If anything happened to you,|what would happen to me, after 37 years?
{6868}{6943}37 years! Has it been all that long?
{6946}{7066}Yes, sir. This is 1952, that was in October|191 5. The Shepherd's Bush murder.
{7069}{7187}The chemist accused of putting|cyanide in his uncle's toothpaste.
{7190}{7310}My first murder trial.|I was more frightened than the defendant.
{7313}{7428}First time I rose to make an objection,|my wig fell off. Where's my wig?
{7432}{7481}Right here.
{7512}{7603}- I've guarded it with me life.|- I hope it still fits.
{7606}{7675}I lost 30lbs in that wretched hospital.
{7678}{7766}Still, I suppose my head isn't any smaller.
{7887}{7937}What's all this?
{7940}{8050}- We've put it in mothballs.|- Mothballs? Am I not to practise again?
{8053}{8136}Of course. The solicitors|have been breaking down our doors.
{8140}{8229}- I've got some interesting briefs for you.|- That's better.
{8232}{8343}Divorce case, a tax appeal,|and an important marine insurance claim.
{8346}{8426}- Nice smooth matters with excellent fees.|- No, Carter.
{8429}{8534}I'm sorry, but you're not to undertake|any criminal cases. Your doctors have...
{8537}{8645}Doctors! They've deprived me of alcohol,|tobacco, female companionship.
{8648}{8711}If only they'd let me do|something worthwhile!
{8714}{8739}Sorry, sir.
{8742}{8830}Might as well get a bigger box,|more mothballs, put me away too.
{8833}{8924}- 2.30, Sir Wilfrid. Time for our little nap!|- Oh, get out!
{8928}{9030}Beddy-bye. We'd better go upstairs now,|get undressed and lie down.
{9033}{9123}- We? What a nauseating prospect.|- Upstairs, please.
{9126}{9187}Are you aware that, while on my sickbed,
{9191}{9320}I seriously considered strangling you|with one of your own rubber tubes.
{9323}{9466}I would then have admitted the crime,|retained myself for the defence.
{9469}{9617}My lord, members of the jury, I hereby|enter a plea of justifiable homicide.
{9620}{9741}For four months this alleged|angel of mercy has pored, probed,
{9744}{9843}punctured, pillaged and plundered|my helpless body
{9846}{9946}while tormenting my mind|with a steady drip of baby talk.
{9949}{10012}Come along now, like a good boy. Oh, no.
{10015}{10082}Take your hands off me,|or I'll strike you with my cane.
{10085}{10168}- You wouldn't, it might break your cigars.|- What cigars?
{10171}{10252}- The ones you're smuggling in your cane.|- Cane?
{10420}{10497}You could be jailed for this.|You had no search warrant.
{10500}{10580}In hospital he'd hide cigars and brandy|all over the place.
{10583}{10649}We called him Wilfrid the fox.
{10652}{10754}- I'm confiscating these.|- Can't I have just one?
{10757}{10813}No. Upstairs.
{10840}{10909}A few puffs after meals? Please.
{10941}{11039}I'll do it. Some dark night when her back|is turned, I'll snatch her thermometer
{11042}{11136}and plunge it between|her shoulder blades. So help me, I will.
{11139}{11294}Oh, no, sir. You mustn't walk up. We've|installed something for you here. It's a lift.
{11298}{11390}A lift? I'm sick of this plot|to make me a helpless invalid.
{11394}{11491}I think it's a splendid idea.|Let's try it, shall we?
{11494}{11610}Out of there. I'll try it.|It's my lift because it was my heart attack.
{11613}{11705}Here you are. Simply press this button|for up and this one for down.
{11708}{11782}Carter, I warn you,|if this contraption should collapse,
{11785}{11887}if the barrister|should fall off the bannister...
{12065}{12129}Remarkable.|Smoothest flight I've had in years.
{12132}{12250}- Upsy-daisy!|- Once more to get the feel of the controls.
{12587}{12650}Good afternoon.|Is it possible to see Sir Wilfrid?
{12653}{12720}I didn't make an appointment,|but this is urgent.
{12723}{12837}If it's about a brief, I'm sorry, but we're|full. Sir Wilfrid has all that he can handle.
{12840}{12892}I'm sure he'll want this brief.
{12895}{12957}Serious criminal matter.
{13008}{13088}Absolutely not, Mr Mayhew.|Sir Wilfrid is still convalescent.
{13091}{13165}He can't accept anything|of an overstimulating nature.
{13169}{13246}Put me on a diet of bland civil suits.|Hello, Mayhew.
{13249}{13310}Hello. Distressing news about your health.
{13313}{13401}It's tragic. You'd better get|a man with younger arteries.
{13404}{13497}If you could just give us a few minutes.|This is Mr Leonard Vole.
{13500}{13632}- He's in rather a ghastly mess, I'm afraid.|- How do you do, Mr Vole?
{13635}{13709}Well, according to Mr Mayhew,|I'm not doing at all well.
{13712}{13776}Sir Wilfrid! Sir Wilfrid!
{13780}{13857}- You're dawdling again!|- Oh, shut up!
{13860}{13959}Sorry, Mayhew. Try me again when|you've something not too stimulating.
{13962}{14036}Like a postman bitten by a stray dog.
{14179}{14305}I wish you could help us, Wilfrid, but|I quite understand. Take care of yourself.
{14331}{14408}Mayhew! Mayhew!
{14411}{14477}Oh, no. Sir Wilfrid, please.
{14480}{14565}Don't worry, we won't take the brief,|but an old friend needs help.
{14569}{14637}Surely I can give him a word of advice.
{14640}{14734}Come on, I'll give you five minutes.|No, no, I don't want you, just Mayhew.
{14738}{14802}Our nap! Sir Wilfrid! Our nap!
{14806}{14870}You go ahead. Start it without me.
{14895}{14965}This is your fault.|You should not have permitted it.
{14968}{15058}It is not my fault. I distinctly told|Sir Wilfrid no criminal cases.
{15061}{15120}Well, if it's anyone's fault,|I expect it's mine.
{15124}{15200}Seems silly to me,|but Mr Mayhew thinks it's very urgent.
{15204}{15298}- He thinks I may be arrested any minute.|- Arrested for what?
{15302}{15352}Well, for murder.
{15355}{15393}Oh!
{15396}{15485}It's the case of Emily French.|You've probably seen reports in the press.
{15489}{15580}Middle-aged widow, well-off,|living with a housekeeper at Hampstead.
{15583}{15635}Mr Vole had been with her earlier.
{15638}{15708}When the housekeeper returned,|she found her dead,
{15711}{15765}struck on the back of the head|and killed.
{15768}{15844}Vole seems caught|in a web of circumstantial evidence.
{15847}{15940}Perhaps if I gave you the details you'd|suggest the strongest line of defence.
{15943}{16030}- I'd probably think better with a cigar.|- Of course.
{16033}{16130}No previous convictions. He's of good|character with an excellent war record.
{16133}{16236}- You'd like him a lot.|- They've confiscated the matches. A light.
{16239}{16340}The defence may turn on establishing|an alibi for the night of the murder.
{16344}{16457}- I haven't got any. Let me get you some.|- Lord, no! You don't know Miss Plimsoll.
{16460}{16524}This will take all our cunning.
{16640}{16687}Young man!
{16690}{16735}Come here, please.
{16738}{16840}Your solicitor and I feel you may be able|to enlighten me on an important point.
{16843}{16894}- Yes. Thank you.|- Sir Wilfrid!
{16897}{16971}You're not in bed yet? Upstairs!
{17051}{17109}- Give me a match.|- Sorry, I never carry them.
{17112}{17183}- What? You said I'd like him.|- But I do have a lighter.
{17186}{17268}You're quite right, Mayhew,|I do like him. Thank you.
{17272}{17379}Can you imagine Miss Plimsoll's face|if she saw me now?
{17382}{17486}Then let's make absolutely sure|that she doesn't.
{17490}{17587}Splendid. All the instincts|of a skilled criminal.
{17590}{17658}- Thank you, sir.|- Here.
{17766}{17825}Whether or not you murdered|a middle-aged widow,
{17828}{17919}you certainly saved the life|of an elderly barrister.
{17922}{17976}I haven't murdered anybody. It's absurd.
{17980}{18079}Christine, that's my wife, she thought|I may be implicated and needed a lawyer.
{18082}{18159}That's why I went to see Mr Mayhew.|Now he thinks he needs a lawyer
{18162}{18225}and now I have two lawyers.|It's rather silly.
{18228}{18281}I am a solicitor. Sir Wilfrid is a barrister.
{18284}{18359}Only a barrister can actually|plead a case in court.
{18362}{18460}- Oh, I see.|- She shall not even find the ashes.
{18532}{18602}- Sit down.|- Thank you.
{18605}{18701}I saw in the paper that Mrs French had|been found dead with her head bashed in.
{18704}{18822}It also said the police were anxious to|interview me since I visited that evening.
{18825}{18919}- Naturally, I went to the police station.|- Did they caution you?
{18922}{19009}I don't quite know.|They asked if I'd like to make a statement
{19013}{19118}and said they'd write it down and it might|be used against me. Is that a caution?
{19121}{19174}Well, it can't be helped now.
{19177}{19282}- They seemed quite satisfied.|- They seemed satisfied, Mr Vole.
{19285}{19377}He thinks that he made a statement|and that's the end of it. Isn't it obvious
{19380}{19498}that you will be regarded as the principal|suspect? I'm afraid you'll be arrested.
{19501}{19556}I've done nothing!|Why should I be arrested?
{19559}{19661}This is England! You don't get arrested|or convicted for crimes you haven't done.
{19665}{19727}We try not to make a habit of it.
{19747}{19816}But it does happen, though, doesn't it?
{19819}{19931}Of course. There was that case of|that fellow, whatshisname, Adolph Beck.
{19934}{20012}In jail for years and they|suddenly found it was another chap.
{20015}{20103}- He'd been innocent!|- Unfortunate, but restitution was made.
{20106}{20208}He received a pardon, a bounty from the|crown, and was restored to normal life.
{20211}{20302}That's all right for him. What if|it had been murder? What if he'd hanged?
{20306}{20382}How would they have restored him|to his normal life then?
{20385}{20490}Mr Vole, you must not take|such a morbid point of view.
{20494}{20591}It's just when you say these things|are closing in on me, it's like a nightmare.
{20594}{20706}Relax. You're in the hands of the finest,|most experienced barrister in London.
{20709}{20795}Let's get this straight. I may have done|something highly unethical.
{20798}{20886}I've taken your cigar|but I'm not taking your case. I can't.
{20889}{21012}I'm forbidden. My doctors would never|allow it. I'm truly sorry, young man.
{21015}{21085}But if you'd like the case|handled by these chambers,
{21088}{21180}- I'd recommend Mr Brogan-Moore.|- Yes. A very able man.
{21183}{21316}- I second Sir Wilfrid's recommendation.|- All right, sir, if you say so.
{21393}{21442}Hold this.
{21522}{21550}Carter?
{21553}{21647}I would like to see Brogan-Moore here|as soon as he comes in from court.
{21650}{21721}Sir Wilfrid, I have never|known such insubordination.
{21723}{21779}Not even as a nurse during the war.
{21782}{21873}What war was that?|The Crimean War, no doubt.
{21897}{21980}You'll like Brogan-Moore,|he's had excellent training. Under me.
{21984}{22078}This morning I had no lawyers at all|and now suddenly I have three.
{22082}{22147}We should explain|that I have very little money.
{22150}{22206}I shan't be able to pay|all the costs and fees.
{22210}{22264}We'll get a fourth lawyer to sue you.
{22267}{22342}He won't get very much.|I haven't had a job in four months.
{22345}{22418}- What sort of work do you do?|- Well, uh...
{22422}{22552}My last job was as a mechanic.|The foreman kept riding me all the time.
{22555}{22635}- I took it as long as I could, then I quit.|- And before that?
{22638}{22742}I worked in a department store, in toys,|demonstrating children's building sets.
{22745}{22863}Of course, it lasted only during Christmas.|Before that I tested electric blankets.
{22866}{22979}- Electric blankets?|- I suppose you think I'm a bit of a drifter.
{22983}{23044}It's true, in a way,|but I'm really not like that.
{23047}{23157}My army service unsettled me. That and|living abroad. I was stationed in Germany.
{23160}{23224}It was fine there, though.|That's where I met my wife.
{23228}{23338}She was an actress, and a good one.|She's a wonderful wife to me, too.
{23341}{23406}But I haven't been much of a provider,|I'm afraid.
{23409}{23520}Somehow, I just don't seem able to settle|down now I've come back to this country.
{23523}{23621}- If I could just put my eggbeater across.|- Eggbeater?
{23634}{23759}Yes, sir. I, uh, I'm a bit of an inventor.|Nothing big, just little household things.
{23762}{23839}Pocket pencil sharpeners,|key chain flashlights.
{23842}{23896}But my best is really this eggbeater.
{23899}{23982}It not only beats,|it also separates the yolk from the white.
{23986}{24043}Is that really desirable?
{24046}{24108}If you were a housewife,|you'd see it right away.
{24111}{24188}The trouble is, I need money|for manufacturing and promotion.
{24191}{24288}I was really hoping that's what Mrs|French might do for me after I met her.
{24291}{24420}- Exactly how did you meet Mrs French?|- That's rather funny in itself.
{24424}{24514}It was 3 September. I remember|because it's my wife's birthday.
{24517}{24585}I was window-shopping in Oxford Street,
{24588}{24707}daydreaming about what I'd buy for her,|if I had any money.
{25834}{25884}- You really like this one?|- Very much.
{25888}{25948}- You don't think it's too mad?|- Mad?
{25951}{26059}Not at all. Daring, perhaps. I wouldn't|recommend it to every woman. But you?
{26062}{26130}- Why shouldn't you attract attention?|- You think so?
{26134}{26215}Absolutely. But if I could|suggest one little thing.
{26218}{26322}Perhaps we could tip it and bring it back|a bit like that. Show more of your face.
{26325}{26354}(squealing brakes)
{26357}{26425}- My bus. Goodbye.|- Good...
{26451}{26511}You buy that hat. I insist.
{26533}{26648}Actually, it was a ridiculous sort of hat -|a silly thing with ribbons and flowers.
{26651}{26757}I'm constantly surprised that women's|hats do not provoke more murders.
{26760}{26793}Go on, please.
{26796}{26857}I was only trying to be nice|to make her feel good.
{26860}{26916}I never dreamed I'd see her again.|Or the hat.
{26919}{26972}- But you did?|- Yes, a few weeks later.
{26975}{27112}Again, by accident. I was peddling my|eggbeaters and business was a little slow.
{27171}{27236}(gunfire and action-sequence music)
{27675}{27748}Would you mind, madam? Your hat.
{27751}{27807}- Oh, it's you!|- Hello!
{27810}{27892}It's your fault, you know.|You chose it yourself.
{27895}{27948}- May l?|- Sure, if you like.
{28042}{28153}Thank you. It's such a bother|taking it off and putting it back on again.
{28156}{28277}That chap is Jesse James. They've led|him into an ambush. It's not at all cricket.
{28281}{28340}- Don't worry, he shoots his way out.|- He does?
{28343}{28410}- I've seen it. I got to the movies a lot.|- You do?
{28413}{28541}I get restless so I go out. Then I find|I've no place to go so I go to the movies.
{28544}{28645}Sometimes I see the same one|two or three times. Ooh.
{28649}{28711}- Toffee?|- Oh, yes, please.
{28714}{28786}At this time you had no idea|that Mrs French was well-off?
{28789}{28865}No. Absolutely not.|We were sitting in the cheap seats.
{28869}{28960}All I knew was she seemed to be|very lonely, had no friends whatsoever.
{28964}{29030}She and her husband|lived abroad in British Nigeria.
{29033}{29143}He was in the colonial service.|He died in '45, of a heart attack.
{29146}{29225}Please, Mayhew, not when I'm smoking.|Go on, young man.
{29228}{29306}Well, they finally|polished off Jesse James,
{29309}{29391}and after we left the movie|she invited me to her house for tea.
{29394}{29443}(Mrs French laughs)
{29486}{29580}I think it's the most fascinating thing|I've ever seen. Janet, come and look.
{29584}{29632}I've seen eggbeaters before, ma'am.
{29635}{29709}But this beats so quickly|and it separates too!
{29712}{29785}It must be cen-trifugal|or centrifugal, which is it?
{29788}{29851}It's specific gravity,|but it whips cream too.
{29854}{29929}Did you hear that, Janet?|It whips cream too.
{29932}{29993}We must have one. Is it expensive?
{29996}{30078}Compliments of the inventor,|manufacturer and sole distributor.
{30081}{30177}Thank you. We'll use it constantly,|won't we, Janet?
{30180}{30291}Come, we'd better get out of here.|Janet doesn't like visitors in her kitchen.
{30456}{30494}Ha!
{30542}{30620}It's a bit chilly in here, isn't it?|Shall we have a fire?
{30624}{30673}Why not?
{30676}{30739}This is a charming room.
{30742}{30846}Hubert and I collected all these things|when we lived in Africa.
{30849}{30902}Hubert was my husband.
{30928}{30995}Well, now, there's a loveable chap.
{30998}{31057}That's the mask of the witch doctor.
{31060}{31120}He wore it when he pulled|our servants' teeth.
{31123}{31214}So Hubert used to call him a witch dentist.
{31237}{31316}- Hubert was so witty.|- Yes, I can see that.
{31319}{31372}Oh, here's tea.
{31431}{31544}- Let's use our good silver and china.|- Oh, no, don't bother, Mrs French.
{31547}{31619}- This is perfectly all right.|- Lemon or milk, please?
{31622}{31681}- I don't really care.|- Would you prefer sherry?
{31684}{31733}- That'd be fine.|- We've no' got any.
{31736}{31840}Oh, but we have. There's that bottle,|the one we bought last Christmas.
{31843}{31963}If you care for an eggnog there's a wasted|egg in the kitchen ready and separated.
{31967}{32083}Do sit down. Don't mind Janet, Mr Vole.|It's just that she's terribly Scotch.
{32086}{32171}Oh, is she? I thought|she came with the collection.
{32197}{32292}You know, maybe|I'll take a glass of sherry myself.
{32295}{32363}I feel like Christmas, somehow.
{32392}{32504}After that I saw her once or twice a week.|She always kept a bottle of sherry for me.
{32507}{32580}We'd talk, play canasta,|listen to gramophone records,
{32583}{32635}Gilbert and Sullivan mostly.
{32638}{32742}It's so weird to think of her now,|lying in that living room, murdered.
{32745}{32854}I assure you she's been moved by now.|To leave her would be unfeeling, unlawful,
{32857}{32906}and unsanitary.
{32969}{33033}Tell Sir Wilfrid about|the evening of the murder.
{33051}{33115}I went around to see her|about eight o'clock.
{33118}{33189}She fixed a sandwich,|we talked, listened to The Mikado.
{33192}{33290}I left about nine. I walked home.|I got there about half past.
{33293}{33392}I can prove that. I can swear to it, in or out|of court, in the witness box, anywhere!
{33394}{33459}How much money did you get|from Mrs French?
{33462}{33511}- Nothing.|- The truth. How much?
{33515}{33605}- Why should she give me any money?|- Because she was in love with you.
{33608}{33657}That's ridiculous. She liked me.
{33660}{33732}She pampered me like an aunt.|But that's all, I swear.
{33735}{33802}- Why didn't you tell her you had a wife?|- I did!
{33805}{33884}But you never took your wife along|when you went there. Why not?
{33887}{33931}- Because...|- Because what?
{33934}{34021}Because she was under the impression|we didn't get along too well.
{34024}{34081}- Is that true?|- No! We love each other.
{34084}{34179}- Then how did she get that impression?|- She just seemed to want to believe it.
{34182}{34265}- You never corrected her. Why?|- I was afraid she'd lose interest.
{34268}{34348}Because she was rich,|and you were after her money.
{34351}{34401}Well, yes, in a way.
{34417}{34533}I was hoping for a loan for my new|invention. Just a few hundred pounds.
{34536}{34614}An honest business proposition, that's all.|Is that so wicked?
{34617}{34669}You knew it was|the housekeeper's day off?
{34672}{34737}- Well, yes.|- You went there because she'd be alone?
{34740}{34802}No, because I thought|she might be lonely.
{34805}{34895}All right, lonely. You and the rich|lonely widow all alone in that house
{34899}{34967}with a gramophone blaring The Mikado.
{34971}{35034}Perhaps you turned up|the volume to drown her cries.
{35037}{35149}- When I left her she was alive!|- When Janet came back she was dead.
{35151}{35246}The house had been ransacked! It said|in the papers. It must've been a burglar.
{35249}{35329}I didn't do it. No matter|how bad things look, I didn't do it!
{35332}{35437}You must believe me.|You do believe me, don't you?
{35461}{35512}I do now, but I wasn't sure.
{35515}{35598}That's why I subjected your eyes|and my arteries to that ordeal.
{35601}{35657}- I'm sorry.|- That's all right.
{35660}{35754}As for things looking bad, they|don't look bad, Mr Vole, they look terrible.
{35757}{35860}- Apparently you've no alibi at all.|- But I have. I left Mrs French's at nine.
{35863}{35943}- By bus or underground?|- No, I walked. It was a fine night.
{35947}{36020}- Did anyone see you?|- Christine saw me when I got home.
{36023}{36146}It was 9.26. I know because I went right to|work on a clock I've been tinkering with.
{36150}{36216}- My wife will tell you.|- Your wife loves you, yes?
{36219}{36274}Very much.|We're devoted to each other.
{36277}{36403}You realise, Mr Vole, the testimony of a|devoted wife does not carry much weight.
{36406}{36472}People might think|Christine would lie on my account?
{36475}{36570}It has been known, Mr Vole.|Blood is thicker than evidence.
{36599}{36714}- Ah, Brogan-Moore. Come in, come in.|- So good to have you out of hospital.
{36717}{36834}I didn't get a full pardon, I'm out on|parole. You know Mr Mayhew, I believe.
{36837}{36904}- This is his client, Mr Leonard Vole.|- How do you do?
{36908}{36964}- How do you do?|- The Emily French murder.
{36967}{37025}- Oh, how do you do?|- Badly, thank you.
{37028}{37125}A mass of circumstantial evidence.|No alibi whatsoever. It's a hot potato.
{37128}{37183}- Tossing it into your lap.|- Much obliged.
{37186}{37261}Your line of defence,|however, will be lack of motive.
{37265}{37340}You will agree that we can rule out|a crime of passion, hm?
{37343}{37409}That leaves us with a murder for profit.
{37413}{37512}If Mr Vole had been sponging off Mrs|French, why cut off the source of supply?
{37515}{37625}Or, if he'd been hoping for a golden egg,|why kill the goose before it was laid?
{37628}{37701}No motive. No motive whatsoever.
{37738}{37858}- You find some flaw in this reasoning?|- No, no, it's very sound as far as it goes.
{37861}{37966}Well, it's all yours. You'll find Mr Vole|very responsive and quite candid.
{37969}{38051}So candid, he's already told me|we'll have to sue him for our fees.
{38054}{38146}Oh, we'll simply put a lean|on Mr Vole's 80,000.
{38149}{38254}- What 80,000?|- The 80,000 Mrs French left you.
{38257}{38285}Left me?
{38288}{38413}They opened Mrs French's|bank vault today and found her will.
{38432}{38537}- Congratulations.|- 80,000!
{38540}{38625}And I was worried about a couple|of hundred for that silly eggbeater.
{38628}{38677}I must call Christine.
{38775}{38811}Oh.
{38814}{38886}This doesn't make things|look any better for me, does it?
{38889}{38972}- No. I wouldn't think so.|- So now they'll say I did have a motive.
{38976}{39108}They will indeed. 80,000 makes for|a very handsome motive.
{39111}{39176}I thought you were crazy|but now they will arrest me!
{39179}{39227}It's not unlikely.
{39252}{39311}(car pulls up)
{39403}{39485}As a matter of fact, it's quite likely.|They're on their way up now.
{39489}{39597}I knew nothing about that will. I'd no idea|she'd any intention of leaving me money.
{39600}{39707}- If I didn't know, how can it be a motive?|- We'll certainly bring that out in court.
{39710}{39818}- It's our old friend lnspector Hearne.|- Chief lnspector as of last month.
{39821}{39909}Chief lnspector? They must think|a lot of you at Scotland Yard.
{39912}{39977}You're getting the de luxe treatment.
{39980}{40108}- Oh, in here, Chief lnspector.|- Sorry to disturb you in your chambers.
{40111}{40201}That's perfectly all right.|I never object to the actions of the police
{40204}{40297}- except once in a great while in court.|- Yes, sir, I still have the scars.
{40300}{40358}You know Mr Mayhew, Mr Brogan-Moore.
{40361}{40471}This is Leonard Vole. You'd better search|him, he may be armed with an eggbeater.
{40474}{40539}- Is your name Leonard Vole?|- Yes, it is.
{40542}{40678}I have a warrant for your arrest|on the charge of murdering Emily French.
{40681}{40801}I must warn you that anything you say|may be taken down and used in evidence.
{40805}{40875}Well, I'm ready. Must I be handcuffed?
{40879}{40938}That won't be necessary, sir.
{40941}{41027}I've never been arrested before,|not even for walking a dog off a lead
{41030}{41122}- or having a beer after hours.|- There's no disgrace in being arrested.
{41125}{41253}Kings, prime ministers, archbishops,|even barristers have stood in the dock.
{41360}{41456}- Somebody better call my wife.|- I will, don't worry.
{41459}{41513}I'll go too, see you're properly charged.
{41516}{41586}- You will see to it that he is well-treated?|- We will.
{41589}{41679}Would you like a cigar? Pardon me.
{41705}{41824}- That's very kind of you, Sir Wilfrid.|- I'd better not. It would constitute a bribe.
{41864}{41912}We ought to be going, Mr Vole.
{42015}{42111}One thing I've learned for sure, never|look in a window with women's hats.
{42114}{42163}Good day, sir.
{42210}{42265}Makes a very nice impression,|doesn't he?
{42268}{42372}- Yes, rather. Give him the monocle test?|- Passed with flying colours.
{42375}{42459}I hope he does as well in the dock.|This is sticky, you know.
{42462}{42554}Of course. The prosecution will|blast in with their heaviest artillery.
{42557}{42667}All you'll have is one little popgun,|an alibi furnished by his wife.
{42670}{42719}Isn't that an intriguing challenge?
{42722}{42818}I think I'd like it more if it was less|of a challenge and less intriguing.
{42840}{42963}Miss Plimsoll has issued an ultimatum.|In bed in one minute or she'll resign.
{42966}{43047}Splendid. Give her a month's pay|and kick her down the stairs.
{43051}{43126}Either you take care of yourself|or l, too, shall resign.
{43129}{43190}This is blackmail.|But you're quite right.
{43193}{43292}For my first day this has already|been rather hectic. I should be in bed.
{43389}{43483}I'd better get in touch with Mrs Vole|and have her come over. Will you sit in?
{43486}{43635}Thank you, no. I'm in no condition to cope|with emotional wives drenched in tears.
{43659}{43786}Miss Plimsoll, how alluring you look,|waiting like a hangman on the scaffold.
{43789}{43842}Take me, I'm yours.
{43894}{43909}Oh!
{43912}{44021}About Mrs Vole. Handle her gently,|especially when you tell her of the arrest.
{44024}{44138}Bear in mind she's a foreigner, so prepare|for hysterics, even a fainting spell.
{44141}{44241}Better have smelling salts ready,|box of tissues and a nip of brandy.
{44244}{44329}(woman) I do not think|that will be necessary.
{44403}{44464}I never faint in case I don't fall gracefully,
{44468}{44559}and I never use smelling salts|because they puff up the eyes.
{44562}{44622}I'm Christine Vole.
{44625}{44689}How do you do?|This is Mr Brogan-Moore.
{44692}{44741}How do you do?
{44744}{44816}- I am Wilfrid Robarts.|- How do you do?
{44819}{44890}My dear Mrs Vole, I'm afraid|we have bad news for you.
{44892}{45012}- Don't be afraid, I'm quite disciplined.|- There's nothing to be alarmed about yet.
{45015}{45102}Leonard has been arrested|and charged with murder. Is that it?
{45105}{45187}- Yes.|- I knew he would be, I told him so.
{45190}{45254}I'm glad you're showing such fortitude.
{45257}{45330}Call it what you like.|What is the next step?
{45344}{45407}Your husband will have|to stand trial, I'm afraid.
{45410}{45535}Will you explain the procedure?|Mr Brogan-Moore will lead the defence.
{45538}{45572}Oh?
{45575}{45643}- You will not defend Leonard?|- Regrettably not.
{45646}{45707}My health, or, rather,|the lack of it, forbids me.
{45710}{45841}It is regrettable. Mr Mayhew described|you as champion of the hopeless cause.
{45917}{46012}Is it, perhaps,|that this cause is too hopeless?
{46182}{46302}I'll have a serious talk with Dr Harrison. It|was a mistake to let you come back here.
{46305}{46367}I should have taken you|to a rest-home or a resort.
{46370}{46429}Some place quiet, far off, like Bermuda.
{46432}{46503}Shut up. You just want|to see me in those nasty shorts.
{46506}{46585}Come now, Sir Wilfrid,|you must not think of it.
{46588}{46684}You must get ready for sleep,|think beautiful thoughts.
{46705}{46837}Now, let's get undressed. Put these on,|tops and bottoms, while I make your bed.
{46840}{46913}After your rest|we'll have a nice cup of cocoa.
{46916}{46990}Then perhaps|we'll have a walk around the square.
{46992}{47057}You know, I feel sorry|for that nice Mr Vole.
{47060}{47168}And not just because he was arrested,|but that wife of his. She must be German.
{47171}{47283}That's what happens when we let our|boys cross the Channel. They go crazy.
{47286}{47397}The government should do something|about foreign wives. Like an embargo.
{47400}{47493}How else can we take care of our own|surplus. Don't you agree, Sir Wilfrid?
{47497}{47554}All right. Hop in!
{47580}{47638}Sir Wilfrid?
{47705}{47747}Sir Wilfrid!
{47750}{47794}Come back!
{47802}{47916}Yes, of course I knew that Leonard had|been seeing Mrs French quite frequently.
{47919}{47947}Go on.
{47950}{48040}I knew when he came home with a pair|of green socks she'd knitted for him.
{48043}{48120}That's quite natural.|I'm sure a jury will find it endearing.
{48123}{48219}Leonard can be very endearing.|He hates that particular shade of green
{48222}{48274}and the socks were two sizes too large,
{48278}{48342}but he wore them just the same|to give her pleasure.
{48345}{48394}Leonard has a way with women.
{48398}{48536}I only hope he has an all-woman jury.|They will carry him from court in triumph.
{48539}{48660}A simple acquittal will do. Now, you know|Mrs French left your husband money?
{48663}{48713}Yes. A lot of money.
{48717}{48833}Of course, your husband had|no previous knowledge of this bequest?
{48837}{48890}Is that what he told you?
{48894}{48953}Surely you're not suggesting different?
{48956}{49053}Oh, no, no. I do not suggest anything.
{49057}{49197}Clearly, she had come to look upon your|husband as a son or favourite nephew.
{49213}{49305}You think Mrs French looked|upon Leonard as a son? Or a nephew?
{49308}{49395}I do. An entirely natural|and understandable relationship.
{49399}{49479}What hypocrites you are in this country.
{49523}{49579}Pardon me, Brogan-Moore.
{49582}{49694}- Do you mind if I ask you a question?|- Go right ahead, Sir Wilfrid.
{49697}{49794}You realise your husband's entire|defence rests on his word and yours?
{49797}{49878}- I realise that.|- And that the jury will be quite sceptical
{49881}{49980}of the word of a man accused of murder|when supported only by that of his wife?
{49983}{50051}- I realise that too.|- Let us, then, at least make sure
{50054}{50146}- the two are not in conflict.|- By all means, let's.
{50149}{50214}I assume you want to help your husband?
{50216}{50353}Of course I want to help Leonard. I want|to help Mr Brogan-Moore and to help you.
{50356}{50455}There. Isn't that|more comfortable for you?
{50469}{50549}Now, Mrs Vole. This is very important.
{50552}{50646}On the night of the murder your husband|came home before 9.30. Correct?
{50649}{50730}Precisely. Isn't that|what he wants me to say?
{50733}{50780}Isn't it the truth?
{50783}{50828}Of course.
{50831}{50901}But when I told the police,|I do not think they believed me.
{50904}{50981}Maybe I didn't say it well.|Maybe because of my accent.
{50984}{51040}My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts
{51043}{51121}we accept the evidence|of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian
{51124}{51187}and who must have an interpreter.
{51191}{51269}We accept the evidence|of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all,
{51272}{51330}as long as they tell the truth.
{51333}{51413}You're aware that when you're|in the witness box you will be sworn
{51416}{51490}- and you will testify under oath?|- Yes.
{51493}{51586}Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely|and did not go out again.
{51589}{51713}The truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth. Is that better?
{51750}{51873}- Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?|- Leonard thinks I do.
{51876}{51967}- Well, do you?|- Am I already under oath?
{51970}{52049}Whatever your gambit may be,|do you know that, under British law,
{52052}{52149}you cannot be called to give testimony|damaging to your husband?
{52152}{52206}How very convenient.
{52209}{52260}We are dealing with a capital crime.
{52264}{52355}The prosecution|will try to hang your husband.
{52381}{52444}He is not my husband.
{52597}{52656}Leonard and I went through|a form of marriage,
{52659}{52753}but I had a husband living somewhere|in East Germany, in the Russian zone.
{52756}{52851}- Did you tell Leonard?|- I did not. It would have been stupid.
{52854}{52953}He would not have married me and|I'd have been left to starve in the rubble.
{52956}{53019}But he did marry you|and brought you safely here.
{53022}{53077}Don't you think you should be grateful?
{53080}{53131}One can get very tired of gratitude.
{53135}{53199}Your husband loves you|very much, does he not?
{53202}{53282}Leonard?|He worships the ground I walk on.
{53285}{53337}And you?
{53340}{53397}You want to know too much.
{53400}{53459}Auf Wiedersehen, gentlemen.
{53486}{53615}Thank you for coming in, Mrs Vole.|Your visit has been most reassuring.
{53618}{53731}Do not worry, Sir Wilfrid. I will give him|an alibi and I shall be very convincing.
{53734}{53854}There will be tears in my eyes when I say|"Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely."
{53857}{53950}You're a very remarkable woman,|Mrs Vole.
{53976}{54035}And you're satisfied, I hope?
{54068}{54202}- I'm damned if I'm satisfied!|- Care for a whiff of those smelling salts?
{54205}{54266}That woman's up to something. But what?
{54269}{54366}The prosecution will break her down|in no time when she's in the witness box.
{54369}{54454}This case is going to be rather|like the charge of the Light Brigade
{54457}{54547}or one of those Japanese suicide pilots.|Quite one-sided.
{54551}{54608}With the odds all on the other side.
{54611}{54673}I haven't got much to go on, have l?
{54676}{54737}The fact is, I've got nothing.
{54763}{54816}Let me ask you something.
{54820}{54903}Do you believe Leonard Vole is innocent?
{54975}{55023}Do you?
{55056}{55115}Do you?
{55118}{55167}I'm not sure.
{55170}{55255}Oh, I'm sorry, Wilfrid.|Of course, I'll do my best.
{55259}{55325}It's all right, Brogan-Moore.
{55328}{55392}I'll take it from here.
{55423}{55544}I have called Dr Harrison and given him|a report on your shocking behaviour.
{55547}{55607}- Give me a match, Miss Plimsoll.|- Sir Wilfrid!
{55610}{55682}Did you hear me? A match!
{56444}{56588}Mr Mayhew. Sir Wilfrid. I'm told you are|going to represent me. I'm very grateful.
{56591}{56720}I struck a bargain with my doctors. They|exile me to Bermuda as soon as we finish.
{56724}{56786}- Thank you.|- There's hope that we'll both survive.
{56789}{56843}- Get into these. We need a photograph.|- Why?
{56847}{56896}This is what you were wearing that night.
{56899}{56993}We'll circulate a photo on the chance|that someone saw you on your way home.
{56996}{57054}Over here against the wall, please.
{57115}{57183}Hold it.|One more in profile, please.
{57187}{57271}Do we really need this? My wife knows|what time I came home that night.
{57274}{57339}A disinterested witness|may be of more value.
{57343}{57412}Yes, of course,|Christine is an interested witness.
{57415}{57469}I'll pick up the negatives later. Thank you.
{57472}{57571}I don't understand it.|Why hasn't she come to see me?
{57599}{57684}Won't they let her see me?|I mean, it's been two weeks now.
{57687}{57751}Mayhew, give me the reports.
{57754}{57829}Have you been talking to her?|Is there something the matter?
{57832}{57955}I want to read a portion of the evidence|of Janet McKenzie, the housekeeper.
{58052}{58139}"Mr Vole helped Mrs French|with her business affairs,
{58142}{58193}particularly her income tax returns."
{58196}{58266}Oh, yes, I did. Some of those forms|are very complicated.
{58269}{58347}There's also a hint you may|have helped her draft her new will.
{58350}{58422}Well, that's not true!|If Janet said that she's lying.
{58425}{58490}She was always against me,|I don't know why!
{58493}{58642}It's obvious. You threw an eggbeater into|the wheels of her Victorian household.
{58645}{58735}Now, this cut in your wrist.|You say you cut yourself with a knife?
{58738}{58827}Well, that's true, I did.|I was cutting bread and the knife slipped.
{58831}{58991}But that was two days after. Christine|was there. She'll tell them in her evidence.
{59022}{59121}Are you keeping something from me?|Is she ill? Was she shocked?
{59125}{59222}All things considered, she took it well.|Though that may be only on the surface.
{59224}{59308}Wives are often profoundly|disturbed at such a time.
{59312}{59384}Yes, it must be hard.|We've never been separated before.
{59387}{59490}- Not since our first meeting.|- How did you meet your wife, Mr Vole?
{59493}{59542}In Germany in 1945.
{59569}{59706}It's rather funny. The very first time|I saw her, the ceiling fell right in on me.
{59709}{59799}I was stationed outside Hamburg,|with an RAF maintenance unit.
{59802}{59934}I'd just installed a shower in the officers'|billet, so they gave me a weekend pass.
{59937}{59986}(music and cheers)
{60016}{60040}(woman) Come on!
{60044}{60080}# Join the party
{60083}{60157}# Have a hearty glass of rum
{60160}{60247}# Don't ever think about tomorrow
{60250}{60324}# For tomorrow may never come
{60352}{60431}# When I find me a happy place
{60435}{60508}# That's where I wanna stay
{60511}{60675}# Time is nothing|as long as I'm living it up this way
{60679}{60794}# I may never go home any more
{60797}{60880}# Dim the lights|and start locking the door
{60883}{60961}# Give your arms to me|Give your charms to me
{60964}{61051}# After all that's what sailors are for
{61054}{61173}# I've got kisses and kisses galore
{61176}{61255}# That have never been tasted before
{61258}{61337}# If you treat me right|This could be the night
{61340}{61376}# I may never go home
{61382}{61418}# I may never go home
{61424}{61464}# I may never go home
{61470}{61506}# I may never go home
{61510}{61593}# I may never go home any more
{61688}{61801}# I may never go home any more
{61804}{61880}Hey, Fraulein, show us some legs.
{61883}{61981}They rob you blind|and then throw you a ruddy sailor!
{61984}{62070}- Come on, let's see 'em.|- We want legs!
{62087}{62164}Come help the cabaret out of her trousers!
{62168}{62248}All right, Fraulein,|if you won't show 'em, I will.
{62250}{62299}(cheering)
{62501}{62550}(whistle)
{62891}{62995}All right, outside, everybody.|Come on, let's go.
{63325}{63351}Come on.
{63397}{63466}Bring him round to the other truck.
{63564}{63637}We'll be back, baby! We'll be back!
{64533}{64582}Gesundheit.
{64746}{64813}- What are you looking for?|- My accordion.
{64815}{64865}Oh, let me help you.
{64868}{64917}(discordant noise)
{64943}{65039}- I think I found it.|- Step on it again, it's still breathing.
{65042}{65078}(discordant noise)
{65081}{65138}I'm terribly sorry.
{65141}{65197}You better go. We've had trouble enough.
{65200}{65297}Well, it's your own fault. That costume|in the picture gave the boys ideas
{65300}{65404}- then those trousers let them down hard.|- That costume went in the first raid.
{65407}{65492}Then raid by raid, my other dresses,|and now you've bombed my trousers.
{65496}{65544}Cigarette? Gum?
{65760}{65814}You're burning my nose.
{65817}{65878}- Oh, I'm sorry.|- That's all right.
{65881}{65941}How about a cup of coffee?|I've got a tin of coffee.
{65944}{65982}How much?
{65985}{66036}I don't know.|What's the rate of exchange?
{66039}{66134}- Depends whether it's fresh or powdered.|- It's instant coffee.
{66137}{66186}Got any hot water at your place?
{66189}{66272}- Sometimes.|- Let's take a chance. Where do you live?
{66275}{66313}Nearby.
{66334}{66378}Come.
{66531}{66582}Sorry, it's the maid's night off.
{66586}{66672}This is pretty horrible.|In a gemutlich sort of way.
{66675}{66762}Oh, it's fine now.|I used to have a roommate. A dancer.
{66765}{66845}She had luck, she married a Canadian.|She now lives in Toronto.
{66848}{66914}She has a Ford automobile.
{66917}{66991}Make yourself comfortable,|the stove is slow these days.
{66994}{67072}That's all right, I've got a weekend pass.
{67076}{67162}No, not that chair. It holds up the|beam and that holds up the ceiling.
{67165}{67223}You'd better sit down on the cot.
{67226}{67266}The cot?
{67270}{67354}Getting more gemutlich all the time.|Are you married?
{67357}{67403}- Why?|- Well, the, um...
{67406}{67470}Oh, that. No, no, I'm not married.
{67473}{67567}I just wear it when I'm working.|Gives a little protection with all the men.
{67570}{67683}- Didn't work too well tonight, did it?|- No, tonight was bad.
{67687}{67740}But it's getting better.
{67829}{67906}- Where's the coffee?|- Ah, coffee, ja voll.
{67909}{68057}Finest Brazilian blend. The same brand|that Field Marshal Montgomery drinks.
{68458}{68518}Is that a fair rate of exchange?
{68522}{68571}Very fair.
{68593}{68695}Would you be interested|in having the whole tin?
{68698}{68747}I would.
{68964}{69058}- How are you fixed for sugar?|- I could use some.
{69062}{69104}Milk?
{69107}{69151}Sure.
{69192}{69247}Milk. Sugar.
{69275}{69332}It's a pleasure to do business with you.
{69335}{69379}Yeah.
{69501}{69597}I also carry biscuits, powdered eggs,
{69600}{69709}- bacon, marmalade.|- I don't know if I can afford it.
{69713}{69812}Don't worry, we'll work out something,|like an instalment plan.
{69815}{69898}# I may never go home any more
{70045}{70117}I'm terribly sorry.|Now you have no ceiling.
{70120}{70214}- Maybe I can fix it, I'm good at it.|- Why fix it? It's not raining.
{70217}{70250}Ooh.
{70253}{70327}- Are you all right?|- I think so. My head aches a little.
{70330}{70384}Maybe I can fix it.
{70387}{70436}I'm good at it.
{70583}{70653}I had a weekend pass,|a month's pay in my pocket.
{70656}{70748}- And she already had a wedding ring.|- Yes, that's right.
{70751}{70830}We got married. When I got out|of the service I brought her here.
{70834}{70926}It was wonderful.|I rented a little flat, Edgware Road.
{70929}{71013}First time she saw it, she was so happy|she broke down and cried.
{71016}{71130}Naturally. She had a solid roof|over her head and a British passport.
{71133}{71266}You don't know her, how she feels about|me. You will when she gives evidence.
{71269}{71387}Mr Vole, I must tell you|I am not putting her in the witness box.
{71410}{71458}You're not? Why not?
{71461}{71551}She's a foreigner, unfamiliar|with the subtleties of our language.
{71554}{71612}The prosecution could easily trip her up.
{71616}{71691}I hear it may be Mr Myers for the crown.|We can't take chances.
{71694}{71795}Quite. We'd better be going. Miss Plimsoll|is waiting in the car with her pills
{71797}{71881}- and a Thermos of lukewarm cocoa.|- Officer.
{71885}{71996}- But Christine must give evidence.|- Mr Vole, you must learn to trust me.
{71999}{72115}For no other reason than I'm a mean,|ill-tempered old man who hates to lose.
{72118}{72183}Let us wish each other luck.
{72310}{72450}Look, I can't face this without Christine.|I tell you, I need her. Without her I'm sunk.
{72481}{72565}Touching, isn't it?|The way he counts on his wife.
{72569}{72687}Yes. Like a drowning man|clutching at a razor blade.
{73056}{73184}Leonard Stephen Vole, you are|charged on indictment for that you,
{73188}{73286}on the 14th day of October,|in the county of London,
{73289}{73359}murdered Emily Jane French.
{73362}{73428}How say you, Leonard Stephen Vole?
{73431}{73504}Are you guilty or not guilty?
{73556}{73591}Not guilty.
{73595}{73635}(murmuring)
{73638}{73689}Members of the jury,
{73693}{73807}the prisoner stands indicted for that he,|on the 1 4th day of October,
{73810}{73879}murdered Emily Jane French.
{73882}{73972}To this indictment|he has pleaded not guilty.
{73975}{74066}And it is your charge to say,|having heard the evidence,
{74069}{74141}whether he be guilty or not.
{74243}{74324}Members of the jury,|by the oath which you have just taken,
{74328}{74412}you have sworn|to try this case on the evidence.
{74415}{74478}You must shut out|from your minds everything
{74482}{74567}except what will take place in this court.
{74571}{74655}You may proceed|for the prosecution, Mr Myers.
{74658}{74744}May it please you, my lord.|Members of the jury,
{74747}{74860}I appear in this case with my learned|friend, Mr Barton, for the prosecution.
{74864}{74957}And my learned friends|Sir Wilfrid Robarts and Mr Brogan-Moore
{74961}{75010}appear for the defence.
{75105}{75161}I trust we are not to be deprived
{75165}{75235}of the learned and stimulating|presence of Sir Wilfrid?
{75238}{75341}My lord, may I assure my learned friend|that Sir Wilfrid is in the Old Bailey.
{75344}{75421}He's slightly incapacitated,|but will be in his seat presently.
{75425}{75549}My lord, may I express my regret that|Sir Wilfrid is even slightly incapacitated.
{75552}{75681}You may, Mr Myers. You may also|proceed with the case for the prosecution.
{75684}{75738}Thank you, my lord.
{75742}{75836}The facts in this case are simple|and, to a point, not in dispute.
{75840}{75939}You will hear how the prisoner made|the acquaintance of Mrs Emily French,
{75942}{75979}a woman of 56.
{75982}{76088}How he was treated by her|with kindness and even affection.
{76092}{76153}On the night of October 14 last,
{76157}{76252}between 9.30 and 10,|Mrs French was murdered.
{76279}{76339}Medical testimony|will be introduced to prove
{76342}{76422}that death was caused by a blow|from a blunt and heavy instrument,
{76426}{76488}and it is the case for the prosecution
{76491}{76568}that the blow was dealt|by the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
{76572}{76621}That's not true! I didn't do it!
{76624}{76647}(murmuring)
{76684}{76751}Among the witnesses,|you will hear police evidence,
{76753}{76846}also the evidence of Mrs French's|housekeeper, Janet McKenzie,
{76849}{76916}and from the medical|and laboratory experts,
{76919}{77054}and the evidence of the murdered|woman's solicitor, who drew her final will.
{77057}{77148}I now call Chief lnspector Hearne,|Criminal lnvestigation Department,
{77151}{77219}- New Scotland Yard.|- (man) Chief lnspector Hearne.
{77222}{77296}- Chief lnspector Hearne.|- Chief lnspector Hearne.
{77727}{77838}This is ridiculous. Just nervous heartburn.|I always get it the first day of a trial.
{77842}{77905}240 above 1 30.|You shouldn't be here at all.
{77908}{77983}- I should be in court, the trial's begun.|- Syringe, please.
{77986}{78044}Be a good, brave boy, Sir Wilfrid.
{78047}{78140}It may interest you to know|that I am descended from a warrior family
{78143}{78271}which traces its brave past|back to Richard the Lion-Hearted.
{78328}{78382}You're to have a calcium injection daily,
{78385}{78478}- tranquillising pill every hour.|- I'll set my wristwatch alarm.
{78481}{78577}Any pain or shortness of breath,|pop one of these nitroglycerin tablets
{78580}{78645}under your tongue.|Oh, and I'll leave you some...
{78649}{78750}That's enough, Doctor.|The judge will be asking for a saliva test.
{78754}{78863}Carter, I'd better take|that Thermos of cocoa with me.
{78867}{78934}- Helps me wash down the pills.|- Let me see it, please.
{78937}{79067}My learned patient is not above|substituting brandy for cocoa.
{79070}{79130}It is cocoa. So sorry.
{79133}{79206}If you were a woman, Miss Plimsoll,|I would strike you.
{79210}{79273}Take care of this, Carter.
{79314}{79401}Now, Sir Wilfrid, in the courtroom,|you must avoid overexcitement.
{79405}{79438}Yes, Doctor, yes, yes.
{79441}{79507}Watch your temper.|Keep your blood pressure down.
{79510}{79618}Thank you, Doctor, I shall be quite safe,|what with the pills and the cocoa.
{79621}{79670}Come along, Carter.
{79699}{79771}From the body temperature|and other factors,
{79774}{79863}we placed the time of death|at between 9.30 and 1 0pm,
{79866}{79999}approximately 30 minutes before Janet|McKenzie returned home and called us.
{80014}{80148}Death was instantaneous, caused by one|blow from a heavy and blunt instrument.
{80151}{80203}Were there any signs of a struggle?
{80206}{80262}None. Just the one blow.
{80266}{80360}Would that indicate that the murderer|had taken Mrs French by surprise?
{80364}{80442}My lord, I must object.
{80463}{80551}My learned friend refers|to the assailant as "the murderer".
{80554}{80639}We have not yet determined whether|the assailant was a man or a woman.
{80642}{80713}It could quite conceivably|have been "the murderess".
{80716}{80859}Mr Myers, Sir Wilfrid has joined us just in|time to catch you on a point of grammar.
{80862}{80914}Please rephrase your question.
{80918}{81062}Yes, my lord. Inspector,|is it your opinion that the assailant,
{81066}{81166}whether he, she or it,|had taken Mrs French by surprise?
{81169}{81221}My lord, I am taken by surprise
{81224}{81341}that my learned friend should try to solicit|from the witness an opinion, not a fact.
{81344}{81414}Quite so. You'll have|to do better than that, Mr Myers.
{81417}{81473}My lord, I withdraw the question entirely.
{81476}{81540}- Is that better?|- That's much better.
{81543}{81592}(murmuring)
{81681}{81726}Silence! Silence!
{81729}{81778}(gavel)
{81805}{81875}Very well, lnspector,|let us proceed with the facts.
{81878}{81983}After establishing the cause and the time|of death, what did you then do?
{81986}{82078}A search was made, photographs were|taken and the premises fingerprinted.
{82081}{82181}- What fingerprints did you discover?|- I found the fingerprints of Mrs French,
{82184}{82292}those of Janet McKenzie, and some which|later proved to be those of Leonard Vole.
{82294}{82347}- No others?|- No others.
{82350}{82465}Did you say the room had the appearance|that a robbery had been committed?
{82468}{82597}Yes. Things were strewn about and the|window had been broken near the catch.
{82600}{82696}There was glass on the floor,|and fragments were found outside.
{82700}{82830}The glass outside was not consistent with|the window being forced from the outside.
{82833}{82995}You're saying that someone made it look|as if it had been forced from the outside?
{82998}{83102}My lord, I must object. My learned friend|is putting words in the witness' mouth.
{83105}{83175}After all, if he insists|on answering his own questions,
{83178}{83261}the presence of the witness|would seem superfluous.
{83264}{83322}Quite. Don't you think so, Mr Myers?
{83325}{83374}Yes, my lord.
{83401}{83436}Inspector,
{83439}{83525}did you ascertain if any of the murdered|woman's property was missing?
{83528}{83603}According to the housekeeper,|nothing was missing.
{83606}{83740}In your experience, lnspector,|when burglars or burglaresses
{83743}{83837}break into a house,|do they leave without taking anything?
{83840}{83867}No, sir.
{83870}{83940}- Do you produce a jacket, lnspector?|- Yes, sir.
{83943}{83997}Is that the jacket?
{84075}{84167}- Yes, sir.|- That is exhibit P1, my lord.
{84170}{84219}Where did you find this, lnspector?
{84222}{84283}That is the jacket|found in the prisoner's flat,
{84287}{84346}which I handed to our lab|to test for bloodstains.
{84349}{84409}- And did you find any bloodstains?|- Yes.
{84412}{84473}Though an attempt|had been made to wash them out.
{84476}{84521}What tests were made?
{84524}{84625}First to determine|if the stains were human blood,
{84629}{84686}then to classify it by group or type.
{84689}{84754}And was the blood|of a particular group or type?
{84757}{84827}Yes, sir. It is type O.
{84830}{84908}And did you subsequently|test the blood of the dead woman?
{84911}{84967}- Yes, sir.|- What type was that?
{85002}{85059}- The same. Type O.|- (murmuring)
{85062}{85153}Thank you, lnspector.|No further questions.
{85156}{85277}Inspector, you say the only fingerprints|you found were those of Mrs French,
{85280}{85339}Janet McKenzie and Leonard Vole.
{85342}{85461}In your experience, when a burglar breaks|in, does he usually leave fingerprints
{85464}{85520}- or does he wear gloves?|- He wears gloves.
{85523}{85580}So the absence|of fingerprints in a robbery
{85583}{85636}- would hardly surprise you?|- No, sir.
{85639}{85734}Can't we surmise the burglar might have|entered a presumably empty house,
{85737}{85803}suddenly encountered|Mrs French and struck her,
{85806}{85885}then, realising she was dead,|fled without taking anything?
{85888}{85950}I submit, my lord,|that it is entirely impossible
{85954}{86063}to guess what went on in the mind|of some entirely imaginary burglar.
{86066}{86121}With or without gloves.
{86124}{86218}Let us not surmise, Sir Wilfrid,|but confine ourselves to facts.
{86274}{86375}Inspector, when you questioned|the prisoner as to the stains on his jacket,
{86378}{86475}did he not show you|a recently-healed scar on his wrist,
{86478}{86592}- saying he had cut himself slicing bread?|- Yes, sir, that is what he said.
{86595}{86662}And were you not told|the same thing by his wife?
{86664}{86757}- Yes, sir. But afterwards...|- Just a simple yes or no, please.
{86761}{86817}Did the prisoner's wife show you a knife
{86820}{86917}and tell you that her husband|had cut his wrist while slicing bread?
{86920}{87031}- Yes, sir.|- I will ask you to examine this knife.
{87132}{87221}Just test the edge of it|with your finger. Carefully!
{87224}{87320}You agree that the point|and the cutting edge are razor-sharp?
{87323}{87381}- Yes, sir.|- Now, if such a knife were to slip,
{87384}{87457}might it not inflict a cut|that would bleed profusely?
{87461}{87489}Yes, sir, it might.
{87493}{87615}Inspector, you stated that the bloodstains|on the prisoner's jacket were analysed,
{87618}{87737}as was the blood of Mrs French, and|they were both found to be of group O.
{87740}{87799}- That is correct.|- However,
{87803}{87885}if the prisoner's blood|were also of this same group,
{87888}{87954}then the stains on his jacket|may well have resulted
{87957}{88022}from the household accident|he described to you.
{88025}{88082}Yes, sir.
{88085}{88176}Did you examine|the prisoner's blood, lnspector?
{88179}{88217}No, sir.
{88257}{88326}I have here a certificate
{88329}{88432}stating that Leonard Stephen Vole|is a blood donor
{88435}{88491}at the North London Hospital.
{88494}{88575}And that his blood is group O.
{88578}{88627}(murmuring)
{88688}{88746}Thank you, lnspector.
{88817}{88931}Inspector, granted that the cut|on the wrist was caused by that knife,
{88934}{89007}is there anything to show|whether it was an accident
{89010}{89108}or done deliberately after the murder|to account for the bloodstains?
{89111}{89178}- Oh, really, my lord!|- I withdraw the question.
{89181}{89215}You may stand down.
{89284}{89356}- Call Janet McKenzie.|- Janet McKenzie.
{89359}{89428}- Janet McKenzie.|- Janet McKenzie.
{89987}{90054}I swear by Almighty God|that the evidence...
{90058}{90106}(buzzer)
{90114}{90196}..the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth.
{90199}{90275}Carter. Carter. Pill. Pill.
{90278}{90362}- Your name is Janet McKenzie?|- Aye, that's my name.
{90366}{90485}- When did you first come to London?|- That was many years ago. 28 years ago.
{90489}{90596}- Where do you live?|- Now that Mrs French, poor soul, is dead,
{90599}{90690}I've moved in with my niece|at 19 Glenister Road.
{90693}{90770}You were companion-housekeeper|to the late Mrs Emily French?
{90773}{90849}I was her housekeeper!|I've no opinion of companions,
{90852}{90931}poor feckless bodies, afraid|of a bit of honest domestic work.
{90935}{91059}I meant you were on friendly terms, not|altogether those of mistress and servant.
{91062}{91137}Aye. Ten years I was with her|and looked after her.
{91140}{91205}She knew me and she trusted me.
{91207}{91276}Many's the time|I prevented her doing a foolish thing.
{91279}{91397}Please tell us, in your own words, about|the events of the evening of October 14.
{91413}{91510}It was a Friday and my night out. I was|going to see my niece at Glenister Road,
{91514}{91620}which is about five minutes' walk.|I left the house at half past seven.
{91623}{91725}I promised to take her|a dress pattern that she admired.
{91728}{91815}- Och, is this thing necessary?|- An excellent question.
{91818}{91924}However, it has been installed at|considerable expense to the taxpayers,
{91928}{92015}so let us take advantage of it.|Please continue.
{92018}{92109}Well, when I got to my niece's,|I found I'd left the pattern behind.
{92112}{92194}So after supper I slipped|back to get it as it was no distance.
{92198}{92276}I got back to the house at 25 past 9.
{92279}{92335}I let myself in|and went upstairs to my room.
{92338}{92463}As I passed the sitting room, I heard the|prisoner in there, talking to Mrs French.
{92467}{92566}- No, it wasn't me! It wasn't my voice!|- (court murmurs)
{92569}{92618}Talking and laughing they were.
{92621}{92705}But it was no business of mine,|so I went upstairs to fetch my pattern.
{92709}{92790}Now, let us be very exact as to the time.
{92793}{92887}You say that you|re-entered the house at 25 past 9?
{92890}{92996}Aye. The pattern was on a shelf in my|room next to my clock so I saw the time.
{92999}{93107}- And it was 25 past 9.|- Go on, please.
{93110}{93254}I went back to my niece. Och,|she was delighted with the pattern. Si...
{93299}{93450}Simply delighted. I stayed until 20 to 1 1,|then I said good night and I come home.
{93453}{93544}I went into the sitting room to see|if the mistress wanted anything
{93548}{93596}before she went to bed.
{93599}{93708}And there she was, dead.|And everything tossed hither and thither.
{93712}{93781}Did you really think|that a burglary had been committed?
{93785}{93834}My lord, I must protest!
{93837}{93936}I will not allow that question|to be answered, Mr Myers.
{93940}{94034}Miss McKenzie, were you aware|that Leonard Vole was a married man?
{94037}{94106}No, indeed.|And neither was the mistress.
{94109}{94157}- Janet!|- My lord, I must object.
{94160}{94279}What Mrs French knew or did not know is|pure conjecture on Janet McKenzie's part.
{94315}{94373}Let me put it this way.|You formed the opinion
{94376}{94459}that Mrs French thought|Leonard Vole was a single man?
{94462}{94547}- Have you any facts to support this?|- The books that she ordered.
{94550}{94667}A life of the Baroness Burdett-Coutts,|and the one about Disraeli and his wife.
{94670}{94767}Both of them about women that married|men years younger than themselves. Oh!
{94770}{94858}- I knew what she was thinking.|- I'm afraid we cannot admit that.
{94861}{94923}- Why?|- (laughter)
{94926}{95051}Members of the jury, it is possible|for a woman to read The Life of Disraeli
{95055}{95154}without contemplating marriage|with a man younger than herself.
{95157}{95208}(laughter)
{95211}{95339}Were you aware of the arrangements Mrs|French made to dispose of her money?
{95342}{95427}She had her old will revoked|and a new one drawn up.
{95429}{95487}I heard her calling Mr Stokes,|her solicitor.
{95490}{95561}He was there at the time.|The prisoner, I mean.
{95574}{95656}You heard Mrs French|and the prisoner discussing her new will?
{95659}{95727}Yes. He was to have all her money,|she told him,
{95730}{95837}as she had no near relations nor anybody|that meant to her what he did.
{95840}{95921}- When did this take place?|- On October 8.
{95924}{96003}One week to the day|before she was murdered.
{96007}{96085}Thank you.|That concludes my examination.
{96107}{96170}Not just yet, Miss McKenzie.
{96196}{96272}Would you...? Thank you.
{96276}{96380}Miss McKenzie, you have|given evidence about two wills.
{96383}{96432}In the old will, that which was revoked,
{96435}{96527}were you not to receive|the bulk of Mrs French's estate?
{96530}{96559}That's so.
{96562}{96666}Whereas in the new will, except for|a bequest to you of a small annuity,
{96669}{96756}the principal beneficiary|is the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
{96759}{96850}It'll be a wicked injustice|if he ever touches a penny of that money.
{96853}{96958}It is entirely understandable|that you are antagonistic to the prisoner.
{96961}{97022}I'm not antagonistic to him.
{97025}{97121}He's a shiftless, scheming rascal.|But I'm not antagonistic to him.
{97124}{97143}(laughter)
{97146}{97195}I suggest you formed this opinion
{97198}{97289}because his friendship with Mrs French|cost you the bulk of her estate.
{97292}{97392}- I've never liked him.|- Your candour is refreshing.
{97395}{97460}Now. On the night of October 14
{97463}{97543}you say you heard the prisoner|and Mrs French talking together.
{97546}{97628}- What did you hear them say?|- I didn't hear what they actually said.
{97631}{97693}You mean you only heard the voices?
{97696}{97764}- The murmur of voices?|- They were laughing.
{97767}{97841}What makes you say|the man's voice was Leonard Vole's?
{97845}{97949}- I know his voice well enough.|- The door was closed, was it not?
{97952}{98035}- Aye, that's so.|- You were in a hurry to get the pattern
{98039}{98109}so you probably walked|quickly past the closed door,
{98112}{98176}yet you are sure|you heard Leonard Vole's voice?
{98180}{98246}I was there long enough|to hear what I heard.
{98249}{98399}Come, I'm sure you don't wish to suggest|to the jury that you were eavesdropping.
{98402}{98462}It was him in there.|Who else could it have been?
{98465}{98569}What you mean is that you wanted it to|be him. That's the way your mind worked.
{98572}{98670}Now, tell me, did Mrs French sometimes|watch television in the evening?
{98673}{98745}Yes. She was fond|of a talk or a good play.
{98748}{98825}Wasn't it possible when you|returned home and passed the door,
{98828}{98880}what you really heard was the television
{98883}{98945}and a man and woman's|voices and laughter?
{98948}{99055}There was a play called Lover's Leap|on the television that night.
{99084}{99189}- It was not the television.|- Oh, why not?
{99192}{99313}Because the television was away|being repaired that week, that's why.
{99316}{99358}(laughter)
{99495}{99545}(gavel)
{99568}{99613}Silence! Silence!
{99654}{99729}Odd. It's not time yet.
{99732}{99805}If my learned friend has no further|questions, I'd like...
{99808}{99882}I have not quite finished.
{99885}{99996}You are registered, are you not,|under the National Health lnsurance Act?
{99999}{100089}Aye, that's so.|Four and sixpence I pay out every week.
{100092}{100165}That's a terrible lot of money|for a working woman to pay.
{100168}{100238}I am sure that many agree with you.
{100241}{100395}Miss McKenzie, did you recently apply|to the National Health lnsurance for...
{100398}{100485}- (quietly)..a hearing aid?|- For... for what?
{100488}{100560}I protest against the way|in which this question was put!
{100563}{100637}I will repeat the question, my lord.
{100640}{100783}I asked you in a normal tone of voice,|audible to everyone in open court,
{100786}{100903}did you apply to the National Health|lnsurance for a hearing aid?
{100906}{100931}Yes, I did.
{100934}{100992}- Did you get it?|- Not yet.
{100995}{101122}However, you state that you walked past|a door, which is four inches of solid oak,
{101125}{101202}you heard voices,|and you are willing to swear
{101206}{101280}that you could distinguish the voice of...
{101283}{101335}(quietly)..the prisoner, Leonard Vole.
{101338}{101387}Who? Who?
{101390}{101413}(murmuring)
{101416}{101465}No further questions.
{101523}{101579}Och, maybe you could help me,|Your Lordship.
{101582}{101680}Six months ago I applied for|my hearing aid, and I'm still waiting for it.
{101683}{101802}My dear Miss McKenzie, considering|the rubbish that is being talked nowadays,
{101805}{101876}you are missing very little.|You may stand down now.
{101879}{101938}(laughter)
{101941}{102019}(Myers) Call Police Constable Jeffries.
{102021}{102124}- Police Constable Jeffries.|- Police Constable Jeffries.
{102378}{102445}I swear by Almighty God|that the evidence I shall give
{102448}{102570}shall be the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth.
{102888}{102957}Mr Myers, does that conclude your case?
{102960}{103080}No, my lord. I now call the final witness|for the prosecution, Christine Helm.
{103093}{103174}- Christine Helm!|- Christine Helm.
{103454}{103503}Christine.
{103762}{103827}I swear by Almighty God|that the evidence I shall give
{103830}{103918}shall be the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth.
{103921}{103983}My lord, I have the most serious objection
{103986}{104084}to this witness being summoned,|as she is the wife of the prisoner.
{104088}{104138}I call my learned friend's attention
{104141}{104249}to the fact that I summoned|not Mrs Vole, but Mrs Helm.
{104252}{104350}- Your name, in fact, is Christine Helm?|- Yes. Christine Helm.
{104353}{104440}And you have been living|as the wife of the prisoner, Leonard Vole?
{104443}{104508}- Yes.|- Are you actually his wife?
{104520}{104558}No.
{104560}{104668}I went through a marriage ceremony|with him, but I already had a husband.
{104672}{104734}- He's still alive.|- Christine, that's not true!
{104737}{104821}There is proof of a marriage|between the witness and the prisoner,
{104824}{104895}but is there any proof|of a so-called previous marriage?
{104898}{105032}My lord, the so-called previous marriage|is, in fact, well-documented.
{105035}{105179}Mrs Helm, is this a certificate of marriage|between yourself and Otto Ludwig Helm,
{105182}{105295}the ceremony having taken place|in Breslau on 18 April 1942?
{105298}{105366}Yes, that is the paper of my marriage.
{105369}{105511}I don't see any reason why this witness|should not be qualified to give evidence.
{105612}{105722}You're willing to give evidence against the|man you've been calling your husband?
{105725}{105759}Yes.
{105776}{105865}You stated to the police that on the night|that Mrs French was murdered,
{105869}{105994}Leonard Vole left the house at 7.30|and returned at 25 minutes past 9.
{105998}{106060}Did he, in fact, return at 25 past 9?
{106100}{106176}No. He returned at ten minutes past ten.
{106179}{106291}Christine, what are you saying?|It's not true. You know it's not true!
{106294}{106329}(murmuring)
{106377}{106428}Silence!
{106432}{106481}I must have silence.
{106514}{106586}As your counsel will tell you,|Vole, you will very shortly
{106589}{106660}have an opportunity of|speaking in your own defence.
{106663}{106762}Leonard Vole returned, you say,|at ten minutes past ten.
{106765}{106850}- And what happened next?|- He was breathing hard, very excited.
{106854}{106919}He threw off his coat|and examined the sleeves.
{106922}{106974}Then he told me to wash the cuffs.
{106977}{107029}- They had blood on them.|- Go on.
{107032}{107104}- I said "What have you done?"|- What did the prisoner say?
{107107}{107161}He said "I've killed her."
{107165}{107272}Christine! Why are you lying?|Why are you saying these things?
{107275}{107375}- What an awful woman.|- She's evil. I've known it all along.
{107453}{107536}If the defence so desires,|I will adjourn for a short time
{107539}{107615}so that the prisoner|may gain control of himself.
{107618}{107708}My lord is most gracious,|but pray let the witness continue.
{107711}{107813}We are all of us caught up|in the suspense of this horror fiction.
{107816}{107909}To have to hear it in instalments|might prove unendurable.
{107912}{107982}- Proceed, Mr Myers.|- Mrs Helm,
{107985}{108100}when the prisoner said "l have killed her",|did you know to whom he referred?
{108103}{108172}It was that woman|he had been seeing so often.
{108174}{108289}When questioned by the police, you told|them that the prisoner returned at 9.25.
{108292}{108348}Yes. Because Leonard|asked me to say that.
{108351}{108401}But you've changed your story now. Why?
{108404}{108458}I cannot go on lying to save him.
{108461}{108540}I said to the police what he wanted|because I'm grateful to him.
{108543}{108610}He married me|and brought me to this country.
{108612}{108685}What he has asked me to do I have|because I was grateful.
{108688}{108761}It was not because|he was your husband and you loved him?
{108764}{108813}I never loved him.
{108826}{108902}It was gratitude, then,|that prompted you to give him an alibi
{108905}{108988}- in your statement to the police?|- That is it. Exactly.
{108991}{109076}- But now you think it was wrong to do so.|- Because it is murder.
{109079}{109130}That woman, she was a harmless old fool,
{109133}{109195}and he makes of me|an accomplice to the murder.
{109198}{109293}I cannot come into court and swear that|he was with me at the time it was done.
{109296}{109361}I cannot do it! I cannot do it!
{109364}{109417}Then this is the truth?
{109420}{109506}That Leonard Vole returned|that night at ten minutes past ten,
{109509}{109559}he had blood on the sleeves of his coat,
{109562}{109661}and that he said to you|"l have killed her"?
{109700}{109742}That is the truth.
{109745}{109821}That is the truth, before God?
{109825}{109876}That is the truth.
{109887}{109936}Thank you.
{110061}{110146}Mrs Vole, or Mrs Helm,|which do you prefer to be called?
{110150}{110198}- It does not matter.|- Does it not?
{110201}{110298}In this country we are inclined to take|a rather more serious view of marriage.
{110301}{110426}However, it would appear that when|you first met the prisoner in Hamburg
{110429}{110537}- you lied to him about your marital status.|- I wanted to get out of Germany, so...
{110541}{110614}You lied, did you not?|Just yes or no, please.
{110617}{110666}- Yes.|- Thank you.
{110669}{110743}And in arranging the marriage,|you lied to the authorities?
{110746}{110816}I, um, did not tell the truth|to the authorities.
{110819}{110874}- You lied to them?|- Yes.
{110877}{110981}And in the ceremony, when you swore|to love, honour and cherish your husband,
{110984}{111045}- that too was a lie?|- Yes.
{111048}{111125}And when the police questioned you|about this wretched man
{111128}{111186}who believed himself married and loved,
{111189}{111249}- you told them...|- I told them what he wanted me to.
{111252}{111344}You told them that he was at home|with you at 25 minutes past 9,
{111347}{111450}- and now you say that that was a lie?|- Yes, a lie!
{111453}{111559}And when you said that he had|accidentally cut his wrist, again, you lied?
{111562}{111679}- Yes!|- And today you told a new story entirely.
{111682}{111766}The question is, Frau Helm,|were you lying then, are you lying now?
{111769}{111859}Or are you not, in fact,|a chronic and habitual liar?!
{111862}{111923}(murmuring)
{111926}{111944}(coughs)
{111948}{112051}Carter, Carter!|The other pill. Under the tongue.
{112055}{112158}My lord, is my learned friend to be|allowed to bully and insult the witness?
{112161}{112262}Mr Myers, this is a capital charge|and, within the bounds of reason,
{112266}{112365}I should like the defence|to have every latitude.
{112441}{112502}My lord, may I also|remind my learned friend
{112505}{112599}that his witness, by her own admission,|has already violated so many oaths
{112602}{112696}that I am surprised the Testament|did not leap from her hand
{112699}{112763}when she was sworn here today.
{112766}{112869}I doubt if anything is to be gained|by questioning you any further.
{112872}{112924}That will be all, Frau Helm.
{112927}{112976}(muttering)
{113042}{113150}Mrs Helm, I presume you know the|meaning of the English word "perjury"?
{113153}{113239}- In German, the word is Meineid.|- Yes. Meineid.
{113243}{113293}It means to swear falsely under oath.
{113296}{113339}And are you aware, Mrs Helm,
{113342}{113461}that the penalty in this country for perjury|is a heavy term of imprisonment?
{113464}{113522}Yes, I'm aware.
{113525}{113639}Mindful of this fact, I ask you once more,|is the evidence that you have given
{113642}{113730}the truth, the whole truth|and nothing but the truth?
{113733}{113780}So help me, God.
{113808}{113913}Then that, my lord,|is the case for the prosecution.
{114340}{114431}- Want a tissue?|- Yes, thanks.
{114434}{114547}It's the first murder trial|I've ever been to. It's terrible.
{114550}{114573}Silence.
{114627}{114716}Sir Wilfrid.|Are you ready for the defence?
{114768}{114859}My lord, members of the jury,
{114862}{114986}the prosecution has very ably presented|against the prisoner, Leonard Vole,
{114989}{115094}a case with the most overwhelming|circumstantial evidence.
{115098}{115182}Among the witnesses you have heard|Chief lnspector Hearne,
{115185}{115307}who has given his testimony in a fair|and impartial manner, as he always does.
{115310}{115428}He has put before you a clever theory|of how this crime was committed.
{115431}{115526}Whether it is theory|or actual fact, however,
{115529}{115591}you will decide for yourselves.
{115616}{115690}And then you have heard|the evidence of Janet McKenzie,
{115693}{115793}a worthy and devoted housekeeper who|has suffered two most grievous losses.
{115796}{115852}One, the death of her beloved mistress
{115856}{115991}and, second, in being deprived|of an inheritance of 80,000,
{115994}{116061}which she'd fully expected to receive.
{116064}{116156}I will not comment|further on her evidence,
{116181}{116277}but will express only|my deepest sympathy for her
{116280}{116349}in both these... mishaps.
{116373}{116509}And most damaging of all, the prosecution|has produced a surprise witness,
{116513}{116624}one Christine Helm, whom the prisoner|brought from the rubble of her homeland
{116627}{116740}to the safety of this country, giving her|his love and the protection of his name.
{116743}{116834}I objected to her testimony|because a wife cannot give evidence
{116837}{116896}harmful to her husband.
{116899}{117059}But it has been proven that her marriage|to Mr Vole was fraudulent and bigamous.
{117062}{117210}Therefore, her evidence must be admitted|and you must consider it.
{117213}{117282}For what it is worth.
{117322}{117427}Such is the prosecution's case.|Now it is the turn of the defence.
{117430}{117528}We could present, on behalf of|the prisoner, witnesses to his character,
{117531}{117626}his war record, the lack of criminal|or evil association in his past.
{117629}{117766}However, only one witness|can shed new light
{117769}{117838}on this tragic riddle.
{117865}{117913}The prisoner himself.
{117948}{118000}Members of the jury,
{118004}{118089}I call Leonard Stephen Vole.
{118551}{118631}I swear by Almighty God|that the evidence I give will be the truth,
{118634}{118711}- the whole truth and nothing but the truth.|- No.
{118740}{118839}- Is your name Leonard Stephen Vole?|- It is.
{118842}{118916}- Where do live?|- 620 Edgware Road.
{118919}{119046}Leonard Stephen Vole, did you or did|you not on the night of October 14 last,
{119049}{119104}murder Emily Jane French?
{119117}{119211}- I did not.|- Thank you, that will be all.
{119214}{119260}(muttering)
{119263}{119371}Have you, in fact, concluded your|examination of the prisoner, Sir Wilfrid?
{119374}{119500}The prisoner has endured three days|of profound mental agony and shock.
{119503}{119563}The defence feels|his faculties should be spared
{119567}{119652}for the cross-examination|by my learned friend for the prosecution.
{119655}{119724}This is not a plea for any indulgence.
{119727}{119800}I am confident that|no matter how searching this may be,
{119803}{119872}the prisoner will withstand it.
{119909}{119996}At the time you made the acquaintance|of Mrs French, were you employed?
{119999}{120048}- No, sir.|- How much money did you have?
{120051}{120102}- A few pounds.|- Did she give you any?
{120105}{120123}No.
{120127}{120180}- Did you expect to receive any?|- No, sir.
{120183}{120301}Did you know that in her new will,|you were the beneficiary of 80,000?
{120304}{120332}No, I didn't.
{120335}{120452}Now, Mr Vole, when you went to visit|Mrs French for the last time,
{120455}{120534}did you wear a trench coat|and a brown hat?
{120557}{120646}- Yes, I did.|- Was it this coat and hat?
{120685}{120709}Yes, sir.
{120713}{120838}My lord, the defence, in its efforts|to establish an alibi for the prisoner,
{120841}{120918}circulated this photograph,|hoping to bring forth a witness
{120921}{120998}who had seen him leaving|Mrs French's house or entering his own
{121001}{121063}at the times that he has stated.
{121066}{121149}Apparently, this splendid effort|was without results.
{121153}{121209}However, the defence|will be pleased to learn
{121212}{121289}that, at the last moment,|a witness has come forward,
{121292}{121404}and that the prisoner had been|seen wearing this coat and this hat.
{121407}{121537}Lamentably, he had not been seen on the|night of the murder but one week before.
{121540}{121644}On the afternoon of October 8, were you|not in a travel agency in Regent Street?
{121647}{121744}And did you not make inquiries about|prices and schedules of foreign cruises?
{121747}{121825}Supposing I did? It's not a crime, is it?
{121828}{121927}Not at all. Many people go on a cruise|when they can afford to pay for it.
{121930}{122051}- But you couldn't pay for it, could you?|- Well, I was hard up. I told you that.
{122055}{122180}And yet you came to this particular|travel agency with a clinging brunette?
{122184}{122241}A clinging brunette, Mr Myers?
{122260}{122310}My lord, the lady was so described to me.
{122313}{122421}She was very affectionate with the|prisoner, constantly clinging to his arm.
{122424}{122471}Oh.
{122488}{122598}You then admit that you made inquiries|about expensive and luxurious cruises?
{122602}{122653}How did you expect|to pay for such a thing?
{122656}{122734}- I don't know. It was...|- If you don't know, perhaps I can help.
{122737}{122843}On the morning of the very same day,|you heard Mrs French change her will,
{122846}{122902}- leaving you the bulk of her money.|- I didn't!
{122905}{122979}And in the afternoon,|you started plans to dispose of it.
{122983}{123036}No! It was nothing of the kind.
{123039}{123114}I was in a pub and I met a girl.|I don't even remember her name.
{123117}{123168}We had a drink and walked out together.
{123171}{123316}We passed the window and saw the fancy|posters, all blue seas and palm trees.
{123319}{123447}The Grecian isles or somewhere. We went|in for fun and I started asking for folders.
{123450}{123542}Well, the man gave me a funny look|because I did look a bit shabby.
{123546}{123627}Anyway, it irritated me,|so I kept asking for the swankiest tours,
{123630}{123715}all de luxe and cabin on the boat deck,|but it was just an act!
{123718}{123818}An act? You knew that in a week|you were going to inherit 80,000!
{123821}{123929}No! It wasn't that way at all.|It was make-believe and childish but...
{123932}{124038}it was fun and I enjoyed it. I never thought|of killing anyone or inheriting any money.
{124042}{124136}It's just a coincidence that Mrs French|should be killed only one week later?
{124140}{124198}I told you! I didn't kill her!
{124213}{124311}Do you know any reason why Christine|Helm should give the evidence she has
{124314}{124406}- if it were not true?|- No. I don't know why my wife...
{124424}{124549}I don't know why I still call her my wife.|She must be lying or out of her mind.
{124553}{124615}She seemed remarkably|sane and self-possessed.
{124619}{124726}- But insanity is all you can suggest?|- I don't understand it.
{124729}{124791}Oh, God! What's happened?|What's changed her?
{124794}{124892}Very effective, I'm sure.|But in this court we deal with fact.
{124895}{124965}And the fact, Mr Vole,|is that we've only your word for it.
{124968}{125038}That you left Mrs French's house|at the time you say,
{125041}{125156}that you came home at 5 and 20 minutes|past 9, and that you did not go out again!
{125159}{125235}Somebody must have seen me|in the street or going in the house!
{125238}{125342}One would think so. But the only person|who did see you come home that night
{125345}{125425}says it was ten past ten|and that you had blood on your hands.
{125428}{125500}- I cut my wrist!|- You cut your wrist deliberately!
{125503}{125552}No, I didn't! I didn't do anything.
{125555}{125625}But you make it sound as though I did.|I can hear it myself.
{125628}{125680}You came home at ten past ten!
{125683}{125788}No, I didn't! You've got to believe me.|You've got to believe me!
{125792}{125845}You killed Emily French!
{125848}{125903}No, I didn't! I didn't do it!
{125906}{125999}I didn't kill her! I never killed anybody!
{126002}{126112}God, it's like a nightmare.|Some ghastly, horrible dream.
{126248}{126308}Good evening, Sir Wilfrid.|How did it go today?
{126311}{126364}Oh, Sir Wilfrid.
{126367}{126495}I'm from Hawks and Hill, sir, and I've|brought your Bermuda shorts for a fitting.
{126520}{126544}What?
{126548}{126656}- You'd better slip these on, Sir Wilfrid.|- I'm in the middle of a murder trial.
{126659}{126756}It'll all be over by the afternoon,|and the boat train doesn't go until 9.40.
{126759}{126842}You work it out. You know my shape,|you've stabbed it often enough.
{126845}{126953}Upstairs. You need a lukewarm bath|and your calcium injection.
{126956}{127027}And there's a lot more packing to be done.
{127050}{127166}It's ridiculous having boat reservations.|The jury may be out for days.
{127169}{127273}Not on this case, I'm afraid.|It seems too open-and-shut.
{127322}{127409}I watched when Frau Helm|was on the stand. They didn't like her.
{127412}{127514}No, but they believed her. They liked|Leonard Vole but they didn't believe him.
{127517}{127595}And that travel agency business|doesn't help either. Cigar?
{127599}{127618}No.
{127622}{127688}- Wilfrid, do you think she lied?|- Well, don't you?
{127691}{127724}I'm not sure.
{127727}{127817}I am. She lied. Whether she calls it|Meineid or perjury, she lied.
{127820}{127941}The only question is why. What's|her game? What is she up to? What?
{127954}{128078}I hope that in your final speech you|won't become too emotionally involved.
{128081}{128151}- You must think of your condition.|- He's right.
{128154}{128239}I want to see you save yourself.|This isn't going to be your last case.
{128242}{128333}Yes, it is. But until it's over,|I'm still a barrister.
{128336}{128428}My client's life is at stake.|That's all that matters - his life.
{128431}{128500}He's entitled to the best that I can do.
{128503}{128600}If I can't stand up to make my final appeal|for him, I'll make it sitting down.
{128603}{128706}If I become short of breath I'll take a pill,|or two pills, or all of them and the box too.
{128709}{128770}(telephone rings)
{128896}{128970}- Yes?|- (woman) This Sir Wilfrid Robarts' place?
{128973}{129054}- Well, yes, it is.|- Let me talk to the old geezer.
{129057}{129163}- Who is this speaking, please?|- Never you mind. Let me talk to 'im.
{129166}{129250}I'm afraid that's impossible.|What is the nature of your business?
{129253}{129333}It's business all right.|I've got something to sell 'im, I 'ave.
{129336}{129365}Well, really, madam!
{129368}{129440}And what I want to sell 'im,|believe me, 'e'll want to buy.
{129443}{129532}- It's got to do with that Leonard Vole.|- Leonard Vole?
{129535}{129589}It's about that German wife.
{129592}{129677}I've got the goods on her and it's for sale.
{129721}{129814}This is Wilfrid Robarts speaking.|Now, what is this all about?
{129817}{129873}Well, hello, ducky.
{129877}{129947}What is this you said|about Mrs Leonard Vole?
{129950}{130042}I'm not just saying.|I've got it in black and white.
{130046}{130117}- You've got what?|- Listen to this carefully, ducks.
{130120}{130203}I'm at the buffet at Euston Station|at the far end of the bar.
{130206}{130289}I'll be here for 30 minutes|because that's when me train leaves.
{130292}{130370}If you want the lowdown on|that German bag, get yourself here.
{130373}{130435}What lowdown?|What do you know about her?
{130438}{130489}Uh-uh. Not on the phone.
{130492}{130594}You'd better get on over here,|and bring plenty of money.
{130610}{130689}Now, just a moment! Hello? Hello?
{130734}{130873}That's... bilge. Some drunken crank.|You get those in every murder trial.
{130877}{130985}Giving me an ultimatum, Euston Station in|30 minutes. Got the lowdown on Mrs Vole.
{130988}{131032}Balderdash.
{131035}{131167}I'm too old and too sick|to go on a wild-goose chase.
{131170}{131239}- Come on, Mayhew.|- Where to, Sir Wilfrid?
{131242}{131316}Euston Station, where do you think?
{131354}{131402}Now, sir?
{131406}{131449}Shortly.
{131471}{131509}Cigar!
{131531}{131580}Sir Wilfrid, where are you going?
{131583}{131695}Your bath, your massage,|your dinner, your injection!
{131699}{131748}Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
{131888}{131952}(train announcement on PA)
{132370}{132443}- You wouldn't be Sir Wilfrid, would you?|- I would.
{132446}{132560}Didn't recognise you without your wig.|Lovely you all look in them wigs.
{132563}{132619}Two o' yer? I'm not talking to two o' yer.
{132622}{132683}This is Mr Mayhew,|Leonard Vole's solicitor.
{132686}{132759}- Well, that's all right, then.|- And your name, please?
{132762}{132893}No need for mine. If I did give you a name|it mightn't be the right one, might it?
{132897}{132998}'Ave a drink, boys.|Two whiskies for me gen'lmen friends.
{133002}{133063}Now what is this information|you allegedly have?
{133067}{133173}You realise that you're duty-bound|to give any evidence that you might have?
{133176}{133288}- Come off it. Did you bring any money?|- What is it you have, madam?
{133291}{133398}Letters. Letters that German wife|of 'is wrote. That's what I've got.
{133401}{133517}- Letters written to the prisoner?|- To the prisoner? Don't make me laugh.
{133520}{133614}Poor bleeder, he's been took in|by 'er all right. And these letters prove it.
{133617}{133741}If we could see these letters, we could|advise you as to how pertinent they are.
{133744}{133810}Well, I don't expect you...
{133887}{133984}Well, as I say, I don't expect you|to buy without seeing, but fair's fair.
{133987}{134097}If these letters get the boy off,|it's 1 00 for me, right?
{134100}{134217}If these letters contain information useful|to the defence, I'm prepared to offer 1 0.
{134220}{134301}What? Ten bleeding pounds|for letters like these?
{134304}{134372}Take that piece of glass|out o' yer eye. Good night.
{134375}{134426}If these help prove my client's innocence,
{134429}{134514}20 should, I think, not be an|unreasonable sum for your expenses.
{134517}{134590}50 and it's a bargain.|That's if you're satisfied with 'em.
{134593}{134650}- 40.|- All right, blast yer.
{134654}{134722}'Ere, take 'em. Nice little lot there.
{134726}{134775}How do we know|these are from Mrs Vole?
{134778}{134881}Oh, she wrote 'em all right.|It's all fair an' square.
{134943}{135012}I 'ope they fix 'er good and proper.
{135057}{135150}I've had messages from Mrs Vole.|It looks like her handwriting.
{135153}{135212}Good heavens, look at this.
{135274}{135323}Juicy, ain't they?
{135326}{135421}- There's one that's even better.|- How did you get hold of these?
{135424}{135498}What's the difference|so long as she gets what's coming?
{135501}{135577}- What have you got against her?|- Ha!
{135581}{135662}I'll give you something|to dream about, mister.
{135688}{135747}Want to kiss me, ducky?
{135835}{135854}Ha!
{135858}{135952}- I didn't suppose you would.|- Christine Vole did that to you?
{135956}{136075}Not 'er, the chap I was going with. He was|a bit younger than me but I loved 'im.
{136078}{136197}Then she come along, started seeing 'im|on the sly. Then one day he cleared out.
{136200}{136330}I found 'em together. I said what I thought|of 'er and he cut me face up proper.
{136333}{136439}- Did you go to the police about it?|- Who, me? Not likely.
{136442}{136579}It wasn't 'is fault. It was all 'ers, gettin' 'im|away from me, turnin' 'im against me.
{136583}{136700}But I waited me time to pay 'er back.|And it's come now.
{136704}{136831}I'm deeply sorry, deeply sorry.|We'll make it another 5 for the letters.
{136834}{136937}'Olding out on me, were yer?|I knew I was being soft with yer.
{136940}{137027}Cold-blooded vindictiveness.|Read this one.
{137074}{137135}Unbelievable.
{137138}{137242}We'd better have the full name of the man|to whom these were addressed, Miss...
{137245}{137293}Miss, um...
{137296}{137341}Where is she?
{137485}{137623}On that train, I should think. Doesn't want|her other cheek slashed. Can't blame her.
{137681}{137731}- Care for another, sir?|- Hm?
{137734}{137783}Good idea.
{137953}{137995}(gavel)
{137999}{138034}Silence!
{138037}{138088}Be upstanding in court.

{138334}{138439}draw near and give your attendance.|God save the queen.
{138770}{138849}Since the defence has called|but one witness, the prisoner,
{138853}{138910}it has the right to be heard last.
{138913}{139064}Mr Myers, if you are ready, let us have|the final address for the prosecution.
{139067}{139173}My lord, members of the jury,|I will be brief in my final speech
{139176}{139288}because I think we've proved so obvious|a case of murder against Leonard Vole,
{139292}{139373}that a verdict of guilty|must be the only possible conclusion.
{139389}{139477}- I will briefly summarise these facts...|- (footsteps)
{139616}{139670}You'd better begin again, Mr Myers.
{139685}{139788}That is, if Sir Wilfrid|is at all interested in our proceedings.
{139790}{139897}I am, indeed, my lord. The speech|for the crown, however, is premature.
{139900}{140020}I ask that the case for the defence be|reopened. And that a witness be recalled.
{140024}{140116}I most strenuously object to the case|being reopened at this final stage.
{140119}{140198}Evidence of a startling nature|has come into my possession.
{140201}{140282}The course my learned friend|proposes is quite unprecedented.
{140285}{140376}I have anticipated this objection|and can meet it with ample precedent.
{140379}{140518}There is the king vs Stillman, reported|in the criminal appeal reports of 1926
{140522}{140579}at page 463.
{140582}{140685}Also, the king vs Porter in volume one|of the king's bench division reports,
{140688}{140769}1942 at page 1 53.
{140772}{140841}And lastly there is the case|of the king vs Sullivan
{140844}{140942}in which this issue was raised, which|I'm sure Your Lordship will remember,
{140945}{141007}since you appeared for the prosecution.
{141010}{141124}I did? Oh, yes, before Mr Justice Swindon.
{141127}{141180}What is this new evidence, Sir Wilfrid?
{141183}{141233}Letters, my lord.
{141236}{141310}Letters written by Christine Helm.
{141367}{141452}My lord, the prosecution|continues its objection.
{141455}{141541}If my memory serves me well,|Your Lordship's similar objection
{141544}{141633}in the king against Sullivan|was sustained.
{141678}{141764}Your memory, for once,|serves you ill, Mr Myers.
{141767}{141876}My objection then was overruled|by Mr Justice Swindon.
{141880}{141956}As yours is now, by me.
{141959}{142008}(muttering)
{142109}{142161}Call Christine Helm.
{142181}{142221}Christine Helm.
{142224}{142290}- Christine Helm.|- Christine Helm.
{142689}{142809}If you still have doubts about Mr Vole, l|wouldn't mind betting you a box of cigars.
{142812}{142908}Mrs Helm, you appreciate|you are still under oath?
{142911}{142939}Yes.
{142942}{143080}- Do you know a man named Max?|- I don't know what you mean.
{143083}{143179}It's a simple question. Do you|or do you not know a man called Max?
{143182}{143236}Max? Certainly not.
{143239}{143331}It's a fairly common name and yet|you've never known a man named Max?
{143334}{143395}In Germany, perhaps, but a long time ago.
{143398}{143562}I shall not ask you to go back that far.|Just a few weeks, to... October 20 last.
{143601}{143672}- What have you got there?|- A letter.
{143675}{143731}I suggest that on October 20
{143735}{143815}- you wrote a letter...|- I don't know what you're talking about.
{143818}{143901}-..addressed to a man named Max.|- I did nothing of the sort.
{143904}{144003}The letter was but one of a series|written to the same man.
{144022}{144073}Lies! All lies!
{144077}{144176}You seem to have been, well, let us say,|on intimate terms with this man.
{144179}{144244}How dare you say a thing like that?|It isn't true!
{144248}{144379}I'm not concerned with the general trend|of this correspondence, only one letter.
{144382}{144499}"My beloved Max,|an extraordinary thing has happened."
{144502}{144573}"l believe all our difficulties|may be ended."
{144576}{144639}I will not stand here|and listen to a pack of lies!
{144642}{144733}That letter's a forgery.|It isn't even my letter paper!
{144737}{144791}- It isn't?|- No!
{144794}{144876}I write my letters on small blue paper|with my initials on it.
{144974}{145012}Like this?
{145014}{145058}(muttering)
{145076}{145205}This is a bill from my tailor for a pair|of extremely becoming Bermuda shorts.
{145208}{145239}(laughter)
{145242}{145350}Wilfrid the fox! That's what we call him|and that's what he is.
{145353}{145456}Now, Mrs Helm, you've been kind enough|to identify your letter paper.
{145459}{145577}Now, if you like, I can have an expert|identify your handwriting.
{145580}{145625}Damn you!
{145637}{145709}- Damn you!|- Leave her alone!
{145713}{145766}- Damn you!|- Mrs Helm!
{145769}{145852}Let me go!|Let me get out of here! Let me go!
{145855}{145889}- Mrs Helm!|- Let me go!
{145893}{145958}Usher, get the witness a chair.
{145961}{146010}(Christine sobs)
{146109}{146257}Sir Wilfrid, will you now read the letter|in question so that the jury may hear it?
{146379}{146505}"My beloved Max,|an extraordinary thing has happened."
{146508}{146597}"All our difficulties may soon be solved."
{146600}{146721}"Leonard is suspected of murdering|the old lady I told you about."
{146724}{146865}"His only hope of an alibi|depends on me and me alone."
{146890}{147039}"Suppose I testify that he was not at home|with me at the time of the murder,
{147042}{147135}that he came home|with blood on his sleeves,
{147138}{147232}and that he even admitted to me|that he'd killed her?"
{147236}{147318}"Strange that he always said|he would never let me leave him."
{147321}{147408}"But now, if this succeeds,|he will be leaving me
{147411}{147504}because they will take him away forever
{147507}{147621}and I shall be free and yours,|my beloved."
{147625}{147741}"l count the hours until|we are together. Christine."
{147814}{147908}Mrs Helm?|Will you go back to the witness box?
{148152}{148278}I now ask you again, Christine Helm,|did you write this letter?
{148282}{148359}Christine, tell him you didn't write it.|I know you didn't.
{148362}{148461}Please answer my question.|Did you write this letter?
{148464}{148507}Before answering, Mrs Helm,
{148510}{148639}I wish to warn you that the law regarding|perjury in this country is very severe.
{148643}{148728}If you have already|committed perjury in this courtroom,
{148731}{148818}I strongly advise you|not to add to your crime.
{148822}{148912}But, if this letter|has not been written by you,
{148915}{149003}then now is the time to state this fact.
{149064}{149115}I wrote the letter.
{149118}{149172}(muttering)
{149175}{149269}And that, my lord,|is the case for the defence.
{149457}{149539}I keep asking which is harder,|your head or your arteries?
{149542}{149595}Stop pressing your luck, you're overdue.
{149598}{149697}We're all packed and ready.|I hope the jury won't take all afternoon.
{149700}{149728}I concede.
{149731}{149808}- Congratulations, here are your cigars.|- Not yet.
{149811}{149895}Come on, it's all over,|wrapped up neat and tidy.
{149898}{149980}- What's wrong?|- It's a little too neat, too tidy,
{149983}{150083}and altogether too symmetrical,|that's what's wrong with it.
{150086}{150163}- The jury is back.|- You're not worried about the verdict?
{150166}{150266}It's not their judgment|that worries me, it's mine.
{150271}{150315}Come along.
{150338}{150387}Where's my wig?
{151081}{151140}The prisoner will stand up.
{151201}{151320}Members of the jury,|are you all agreed upon your verdict?
{151358}{151387}We are.
{151390}{151492}Do you find the prisoner at the bar,|Leonard Stephen Vole,
{151495}{151604}guilty or not guilty|of the murder of Emily Jane French?
{151699}{151732}Not guilty, m'lord.
{151735}{151793}(shouting / gasping)
{152213}{152244}Silence!
{152250}{152292}Silence!
{152362}{152454}Leonard Stephen Vole,|you have been found not guilty
{152457}{152566}of the murder|of Emily Jane French on October 14.
{152569}{152677}You are hereby discharged|and are free to leave the court.
{152939}{153019}Persons with anything more to do|before the queen's justices
{153022}{153075}of oyer and terminer and jail delivery
{153078}{153197}for the jurisdiction of the Central|Criminal Court may depart the area.
{153407}{153495}Thank you. Yes, we'll talk later.|Thank you, Mr Mayhew.
{153498}{153558}Thank you, Mr Brogan-Moore. Carter.
{153561}{153643}Thank you, Sir Wilfrid, for everything.|You were wonderful.
{153647}{153738}- I'd say we were lucky all around.|- Yeah.
{153741}{153833}I have your belongings. Sign the receipt,|Mr Vole, and we can release you.
{153836}{153911}"Mr Vole." They didn't call me Mr|when they charged me.
{153915}{154039}- I'll go with you, I have your hat and coat.|- Let's go before they change their mind!
{154266}{154343}Chipper, isn't he? An hour ago,|he had one foot on the gallows
{154346}{154397}and the other on a banana peel.
{154400}{154478}You ought to be very proud, Wilfrid.|Aren't you?
{154481}{154553}Not yet. We've disposed of the gallows,
{154556}{154653}but there's still that banana peel|somewhere, under somebody's foot.
{154657}{154695}(commotion)
{154979}{155092}- (woman) Every word you said was a lie!|- (man) You ought to be locked up! Liar!
{155095}{155174}You'd better wait here|until we get rid of that crowd, madam.
{155177}{155226}Thank you.
{155317}{155395}Ready, sir? Miss Plimsoll will be waiting.
{155398}{155532}Let me finish the last of the cocoa|while I'm still beyond her jurisdiction.
{155535}{155639}Would you excuse me,|Brogan-Moore, Carter? Thank you.
{156286}{156384}I never thought you British could get|so emotional. Especially in public.
{156387}{156447}- I apologise for my compatriots.|- It's all right.
{156450}{156544}I don't mind being called names or|pushed around or even kicked in the shin.
{156547}{156604}But I have a ladder|in my last pair of nylons.
{156607}{156709}In case you are not familiar with|our prison regulations, no silk stockings.
{156712}{156765}Prison? Will I go to prison?
{156768}{156855}You heard the judge.|You will certainly be charged with perjury,
{156858}{156962}- tried for it, and to prison you shall go.|- Well, it won't be for life, will it?
{156965}{157052}If I were appearing|for the prosecution, it would be.
{157055}{157151}You loathe me, don't you?|Like the people outside.
{157154}{157229}What a wicked woman I am,|and how brilliantly you exposed me
{157232}{157345}and saved Leonard's life.|The great Sir Wilfrid Robarts did it again.
{157348}{157487}Well, let me tell you something.|You didn't do it alone. You had help.
{157513}{157554}What are you driving at?
{157557}{157628}I'm not driving at anything.|Leonard is free and we did it.
{157631}{157664}- We?|- Remember?
{157667}{157755}When you said that no jury would|believe an alibi given by a loving wife,
{157758}{157856}no matter how much she swore|he was innocent? That gave me the idea.
{157859}{157898}What idea?
{157901}{158008}The idea that I should be a witness, not|for my husband, but for the prosecution.
{158011}{158106}That I should swear Leonard was guilty|and that you should expose me as a liar
{158109}{158212}because only then would they believe|Leonard was innocent.
{158215}{158303}So now you know|the whole story, Sir Wilfrid.
{158430}{158532}I'll give yer something|to dream about, mister.
{158535}{158598}Want to kiss me, ducky?
{158688}{158786}I suspected something, but not that.
{158789}{158861}- Never that!|- Thank you for the compliment.
{158864}{158954}It's been a long time since I acted|and I never played such a vital role.
{158957}{159026}All those blue letters!
{159029}{159117}It took me hours to write them,|to invent Max. There never was a Max.
{159120}{159178}There's never been anyone but Leonard.
{159181}{159235}My dear, could you not have trusted me,
{159239}{159333}worked with me truthfully|and honourably? We would have won.
{159337}{159406}I could not run that risk.|You thought he was innocent.
{159410}{159486}And you knew he was innocent.|I understand.
{159489}{159567}No, Sir Wilfrid,|you do not understand at all.
{159570}{159630}I knew he was guilty.
{159711}{159782}That can't be true! No!
{159811}{159869}Listen to me, once and for all.
{159873}{159937}He came home after ten,|he had blood on his sleeves,
{159940}{160023}he said he had killed the woman,|only I could save him. He pleaded.
{160027}{160101}And you saved him? A murderer?
{160104}{160155}Again, you don't understand.
{160158}{160207}I love him.
{160346}{160403}I told you she was an actress.|And a good one.
{160406}{160445}Leonard!
{160448}{160524}I knew she'd do something,|but I just didn't know what or how.
{160527}{160576}Leonard, Leonard.
{160625}{160758}- Fooled you completely, didn't she?|- It was you, Vole, who fooled me.
{160761}{160896}Oh, easy. Easy. We both got|out of this alive, let's stay this way.
{160900}{160983}- Where are your pills?|- You've made a mockery of English law.
{160986}{161064}Who did? You got me off|and I can't be tried again for this.
{161067}{161177}- That's English law too, isn't it?|- You can't touch him now. Nobody can.
{161180}{161246}The scales of justice|may tip one way or another,
{161249}{161323}but ultimately they balance out.|You'll pay for this.
{161326}{161426}Ultimately's a long way off. I'd rather|pay for it as soon as possible and in cash.
{161429}{161539}Suppose we double your fee? There'll be|lots of money once the will goes through.
{161542}{161612}I'm not cheap, I want everybody|to get something out of it.
{161615}{161701}There's Janet McKenzie.|We'll get her that new hearing aid.
{161705}{161824}And we'll get you a new one of these.|18-carat gold if they make them.
{161828}{161916}And when they try you for perjury|there'll be 5,000 for the defence.
{161919}{162033}I don't care, just so we'll be together.|You don't know what I've been through.
{162036}{162155}Standing in the witness box, having|to face you, saying I never loved you.
{162158}{162187}What is it, Leonard?
{162190}{162283}The luggage is in the car and we've|only 20 minutes to catch the boat train.
{162286}{162348}This is a nice young lady|I met during the trial.
{162351}{162383}Len!
{162387}{162426}Oh, Len!
{162429}{162469}Len...
{162507}{162596}Oh, Len, they've been trying to keep|me away. It's had me nearly crazy.
{162599}{162659}Leonard, who's this girl?
{162663}{162727}I'm not this girl, I'm his girl.
{162731}{162774}Tell her, Len.
{162778}{162861}Leonard, is this the girl|who was with you in the travel bureau?
{162864}{162940}The girl you said you hardly knew,|didn't even know her name?
{162943}{163055}That's right. That's who I am and I know|all about you. You're not his wife.
{163058}{163161}Never have been. You're years older than|he is. We've been together for months
{163164}{163306}and we're going away on a cruise,|just like they said in court. Tell her, Len.
{163309}{163429}- Yes, Len, tell me yourself.|- All right, Diana, come along.
{163432}{163497}You can't, not after what I've done.|I won't let you.
{163500}{163571}I saved your life|getting you out of Germany,
{163574}{163651}you got me out of this mess,|so we're even. It's over now.
{163654}{163763}Don't, Leonard! Don't leave me!|Don't, Leonard! Don't!
{163766}{163835}Pull yourself together.|They'll have you up for perjury.
{163838}{163948}Don't make it worse|or they'll try you as an accessory.
{163952}{164006}And you know what that means.
{164009}{164122}I don't care. Let them. Let them try me|for perjury, or an accessory, or...
{164146}{164209}- Ready?|- Or better yet...
{164212}{164260}Iet them try me for...!
{164263}{164307}Argh!
{164386}{164430}(Diana screams)
{164472}{164516}(sobs)
{164824}{164934}- Call a doctor.|- It's no use. No doctor can help now.
{164959}{165016}- What happened?|- She killed him.
{165019}{165067}Killed him?
{165070}{165125}She executed him.
{165163}{165225}Carter, what have you done|with the luggage?
{165229}{165366}I sent it on ahead to the station,|and I've got a cab waiting outside.
{165522}{165617}- A remarkable woman.|- You can just barely catch the boat train.
{165620}{165711}Better bring the luggage back,|and you can dismiss the cab.
{165715}{165789}We are not going yet, are we?
{165846}{165915}Thank you, Miss Plimsoll.
{165918}{165983}Get Brogan-Moore to my chambers,|and Mayhew too.
{165986}{166088}We're appearing for the defence|in the trial of Christine Vole.
{166091}{166135}Sir Wilfrid?
{166138}{166203}You've forgotten your brandy.
{166746}{166792}The management of this theatre suggests
{166795}{166897}that for the greater entertainment of|friends who have not yet seen the picture,
{166900}{166977}you will not divulge to anyone|the secret of the ending
{166980}{167045}of "Witness For The Prosecution".
