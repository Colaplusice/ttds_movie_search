1
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:55,519
You never did eat your lunch,
did you?

2
00:02:55,589 --> 00:02:58,752
I better get back to the office.
These extended lunch hours...

3
00:02:58,825 --> 00:03:00,759
give my boss excess acid.

4
00:03:00,827 --> 00:03:02,692
Why don't you call your boss
and tell him...

5
00:03:02,762 --> 00:03:04,992
you're taking the rest
of the afternoon off?

6
00:03:05,065 --> 00:03:07,499
It's Friday anyway,
and hot.

7
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:12,368
What do I do with my free afternoon?
Walk you to the airport?

8
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:14,964
Well, we could laze
around here a while longer.

9
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,875
Checking-out time is 3:00 p.m.

10
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:22,381
Hotels of this sort aren't
interested in you when you come in...

11
00:03:22,449 --> 00:03:24,849
but when your time is up...

12
00:03:24,918 --> 00:03:27,682
Oh, Sam, I hate having to be with you
in a place like this.

13
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:29,688
I've heard of married couples who
deliberately spend a night...

14
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:31,485
in a cheap hotel.

15
00:03:31,558 --> 00:03:35,517
When you're married you can do
a lot of things deliberately.

16
00:03:35,595 --> 00:03:38,223
You sure talk like
a girl who's been married.

17
00:03:38,298 --> 00:03:41,358
Oh, Sam, this is
the last time.

18
00:03:41,434 --> 00:03:44,995
- Yeah? For what?
- For this.

19
00:03:45,071 --> 00:03:48,734
For meeting you in secret
so we can be secretive.

20
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:51,606
You come down here
on business trips,

21
00:03:51,678 --> 00:03:54,010
and we steal lunch hours.

22
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:57,140
I wish you
wouldn't even come.

23
00:03:57,217 --> 00:04:00,846
What do we do instead?
Write each other lurid love letters?

24
00:04:00,921 --> 00:04:03,116
Oh, I have to go, Sam.

25
00:04:05,392 --> 00:04:08,555
- I can come down next week.
- No.

26
00:04:08,628 --> 00:04:13,725
Not even just to see you?
Have lunch in public?

27
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,964
Oh, we can see each other.
We can even have dinner.

28
00:04:18,038 --> 00:04:20,006
But respectably.

29
00:04:20,073 --> 00:04:22,906
In my house with my mother's
picture on the mantel and...

30
00:04:22,976 --> 00:04:26,707
my sister helping me broil
a big steak for three.

31
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:29,078
And after the steak, do we
send sister to the movies...

32
00:04:29,149 --> 00:04:31,083
turn Mama's picture to the wall?

33
00:04:31,151 --> 00:04:33,210
Sam!

34
00:04:35,388 --> 00:04:37,549
All right.

35
00:04:43,129 --> 00:04:46,223
Marion, whenever it's possible,
I want to see you.

36
00:04:46,299 --> 00:04:50,827
And under any circumstances,
even respectability.

37
00:04:50,904 --> 00:04:54,237
You make respectability
sound disrespectful.

38
00:04:54,307 --> 00:04:59,609
I'm all for it. It requires patience,
temperance, a lot of sweating out.

39
00:04:59,679 --> 00:05:03,945
Otherwise, though,
it's just hard work.

40
00:05:04,017 --> 00:05:09,080
But if I can see you and touch you
even as simply as this, I won't mind it.

41
00:05:11,391 --> 00:05:13,882
I'm tired of sweating
for people who aren't there.

42
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:16,861
I sweat to pay off my father's
debts, and he's in his grave.

43
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:19,865
I sweat to pay my ex-wife alimony,
and she's living...

44
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:21,594
on the other side of the world.

45
00:05:22,669 --> 00:05:24,500
I pay too.

46
00:05:26,106 --> 00:05:28,666
They also pay
who meet in hotel rooms.

47
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:34,074
A couple of years and
my debts will be paid off.

48
00:05:34,147 --> 00:05:36,240
If she ever remarries,
the alimony stops.

49
00:05:36,316 --> 00:05:40,946
- I haven't even been married once yet.
- But when you do, you'll swing.

50
00:05:41,021 --> 00:05:43,956
Oh, Sam, let's get married.

51
00:05:47,794 --> 00:05:52,697
And live with me in a storeroom
behind a hardware store in Fairvale?

52
00:05:52,766 --> 00:05:55,326
We'll have lots of laughs.
I'll tell you what.

53
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:59,031
When I send my ex-wife her alimony,
you can lick the stamps.

54
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,869
I'll lick the stamps.

55
00:06:09,115 --> 00:06:14,417
You want to cut this off, go out
and find yourself somebody available?

56
00:06:14,487 --> 00:06:16,887
I'm thinking of it.

57
00:06:19,993 --> 00:06:23,429
How could you even
think a thing like that?

58
00:06:23,496 --> 00:06:26,260
- Don't miss your plane.
- We can leave together, can't we?

59
00:06:26,332 --> 00:06:30,200
Mm-mm. I'm late and, uh,
you have to put your shoes on.

60
00:06:43,016 --> 00:06:45,507
Isn't Mr. Lowery
back from lunch?

61
00:06:45,585 --> 00:06:48,486
He's lunching with the man who's
buying the Harris Street property.

62
00:06:48,555 --> 00:06:52,013
The old lease man. That's why
he's late. You got a headache?

63
00:06:52,092 --> 00:06:55,027
It'll pass.
Headaches are like resolutions...

64
00:06:55,095 --> 00:06:57,586
you forget them
as soon as they stop hurting.

65
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,599
Have you got some aspirin?
I've got something, not aspirin.

66
00:07:00,667 --> 00:07:03,534
My mother's doctor gave them to me
the day of my wedding.

67
00:07:03,603 --> 00:07:06,629
Teddy was furious when he found out
I'd taken tranquilizers.

68
00:07:06,706 --> 00:07:08,799
Any calls?

69
00:07:08,875 --> 00:07:13,209
Teddy called me. My mother
called to see if Teddy called.

70
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,544
Oh, your sister called to say she's
going to Tucson to do some buying...

71
00:07:16,616 --> 00:07:18,914
and she'll be gone the whole weekend...

72
00:07:21,855 --> 00:07:26,622
Wow. It's as hot
as fresh milk.

73
00:07:26,693 --> 00:07:31,392
Hey, you girls oughta get your boss
to air condition ya up.

74
00:07:31,464 --> 00:07:33,557
He can afford it today.

75
00:07:33,633 --> 00:07:36,659
Marion, will you get the copies
of that deed ready for Mr. Cassidy?

76
00:07:36,736 --> 00:07:40,672
- Yes, sir.
- Tomorrow's the day, my little girl.

77
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,107
Oh... Oh, not you.
My daughter.

78
00:07:44,177 --> 00:07:46,509
A baby.

79
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:51,482
Tomorrow she stands her sweet self
up there and gets married away from me.

80
00:07:51,551 --> 00:07:56,454
I want you to take a look at my baby.

81
00:07:57,991 --> 00:07:59,925
Eighteen years old...

82
00:07:59,993 --> 00:08:04,657
and she never had an unhappy day
in any one of those years.

83
00:08:04,731 --> 00:08:07,859
Come on, Tom.
My office is air conditioned.

84
00:08:07,934 --> 00:08:10,459
Do you know what I do
about unhappiness?

85
00:08:10,537 --> 00:08:13,097
I buy it off.

86
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:15,539
Are, uh...
Are you unhappy?

87
00:08:15,608 --> 00:08:18,600
Uh, not inordinately.

88
00:08:20,780 --> 00:08:25,183
I'm buying this house
for my baby's wedding present.

89
00:08:25,251 --> 00:08:27,879
Forty thousand
dollars cash.

90
00:08:29,422 --> 00:08:31,856
Now that's...
that's not buying happiness.

91
00:08:31,925 --> 00:08:35,361
That's just buying off unhappiness.

92
00:08:37,163 --> 00:08:40,655
I never carry more than
I can afford to lose.

93
00:08:40,733 --> 00:08:43,065
- Count 'em!
- I declare!

94
00:08:43,136 --> 00:08:46,697
I don't. That's how
I get to keep it.

95
00:08:46,773 --> 00:08:50,971
Tom, a cash transaction
of this size is most irregular.

96
00:08:51,044 --> 00:08:53,706
Ah, so what?
It's my private money.

97
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:57,045
- Now it's yours.
- Suppose we put it in the safe,

98
00:08:57,116 --> 00:09:00,517
and then Monday morning
when you're feeling good...

99
00:09:00,587 --> 00:09:05,650
Oh, speaking of feeling good, where's
that bottle you said was in your desk?

100
00:09:05,725 --> 00:09:09,684
Uh-oh.

101
00:09:09,762 --> 00:09:14,358
You know, uh, sometimes
I can keep my mouth shut.

102
00:09:19,706 --> 00:09:22,834
Lowery, I am dying
of "thirst-aroonie."

103
00:09:25,345 --> 00:09:28,143
I don't even want it in
the office over the weekend.

104
00:09:28,214 --> 00:09:33,117
Put it in the safe deposit box in the
bank, and we'll get a check on Monday.

105
00:09:33,186 --> 00:09:35,746
Yes.

106
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:44,222
He was flirting with you. I guess
he must've noticed my wedding ring.

107
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:59,501
Come in.

108
00:10:01,347 --> 00:10:05,249
The copies. If you don't mind,
I'd like to go home after the bank.

109
00:10:05,318 --> 00:10:07,684
- I have a slight...
- You go right on home.

110
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:10,655
Because me and your boss are goin' out
and get ourselves...

111
00:10:10,723 --> 00:10:12,657
a little drinkin' done, right?

112
00:10:12,725 --> 00:10:15,523
- Of course. Do you feel ill?
- Just a headache.

113
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:20,157
What you need is a weekend in Las Vegas,
the playground of the world.

114
00:10:20,233 --> 00:10:22,531
I'm going to spend this weekend
in bed. Thank you.

115
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:29,732
Aren't you going to take the pills?
They'll knock that headache out.

116
00:10:29,809 --> 00:10:33,210
Can't buy off unhappiness
with pills.

117
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,148
I guess I'll go put this money in the
bank and then go home and sleep it off.

118
00:12:40,339 --> 00:12:43,672
Marion, what in the world...
What are you doing up here?

119
00:12:43,743 --> 00:12:46,507
Of course I'm glad to see you.
I always am.

120
00:12:46,579 --> 00:12:50,515
What is it, Marion?

121
00:14:26,712 --> 00:14:29,681
Uh, hold it there.

122
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:37,254
In quite a hurry.

123
00:14:37,323 --> 00:14:42,818
I didn't intend to sleep so long. I
almost had an accident from sleepiness.

124
00:14:42,895 --> 00:14:46,558
- So, I decided to pull over.
- You slept here all night?

125
00:14:46,632 --> 00:14:50,534
Yes. As I said,
I couldn't keep my eyes open.

126
00:14:50,603 --> 00:14:54,039
There are plenty of motels
in this area. You should've...

127
00:14:54,106 --> 00:14:56,301
I mean, just to be safe.

128
00:14:56,375 --> 00:14:59,310
I didn't intend to sleep all night.
I just pulled over.

129
00:14:59,378 --> 00:15:01,369
Have I broken any laws?

130
00:15:01,447 --> 00:15:03,677
- No, ma'am.
- Then I'm free to go?

131
00:15:05,117 --> 00:15:07,881
Is anything wrong?

132
00:15:07,954 --> 00:15:11,617
Of course not. Am I acting
as if there's something wrong?

133
00:15:11,691 --> 00:15:16,685
- Frankly, yes.
- Please, I'd like to go.

134
00:15:16,762 --> 00:15:19,458
- Well, is there?
- Is there what?

135
00:15:22,401 --> 00:15:24,699
I've told you there's nothing wrong,
except I'm in a hurry...

136
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:26,704
and you're taking up my time.

137
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:28,637
Now, just a moment.

138
00:15:28,708 --> 00:15:32,269
Turn your motor off, please.

139
00:15:32,345 --> 00:15:35,246
May I see your license?

140
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:40,885
- Why?
- Please.

141
00:17:46,379 --> 00:17:49,041
Be with you in a second!

142
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,742
- I'm in no mood for trouble.
- What?

143
00:18:54,814 --> 00:18:57,874
There's an old saying: "First customer
of the day is always the most trouble."

144
00:18:57,950 --> 00:18:59,884
But I'm in no mood for it,

145
00:18:59,952 --> 00:19:02,420
so I'm gonna treat you so fair
you won't have one reason...

146
00:19:02,488 --> 00:19:06,083
- Can I trade my car and take another?
- Do anything you have a mind to.

147
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:09,093
Bein' a woman, you will.
That yours?

148
00:19:09,161 --> 00:19:11,857
Yes, it's, it's... There's
nothing wrong with it. I just...

149
00:19:11,931 --> 00:19:13,865
Sick of the sight of it.

150
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:17,494
Have a look around and see if there's
something that strikes your eyes,

151
00:19:17,570 --> 00:19:19,834
and I'll have my mechanic
give yours the once-over.

152
00:19:19,905 --> 00:19:21,839
- You want some coffee?
- No, thank you. I'm in a hurry...

153
00:19:21,907 --> 00:19:23,670
and just wanna make a change.

154
00:19:23,742 --> 00:19:25,505
One thing people never oughta be
when they're buyin' used cars...

155
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,944
and that's in a hurry, but like I said,
it's too nice a day to argue.

156
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:32,143
I'll shoot your car
in the garage here.

157
00:19:53,105 --> 00:19:55,039
That's the one I'd have
picked for you myself.

158
00:19:55,107 --> 00:19:56,734
- How much?
- Go ahead.

159
00:19:56,809 --> 00:19:58,504
- Spin it around the block.
- It looks fine.

160
00:19:58,577 --> 00:20:00,511
How much would it be
with my car?

161
00:20:00,579 --> 00:20:03,776
You mean you don't want the usual day
and a half to think it over?

162
00:20:03,849 --> 00:20:08,218
You are in a hurry, aren't you?
Somebody chasin' ya?

163
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:10,221
Of course not.
Please.

164
00:20:10,289 --> 00:20:16,194
Well, it's the first time the customer
ever high pressured the salesman.

165
00:20:16,262 --> 00:20:20,756
Ah, I figure roughly...

166
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:23,825
your car plus $700.

167
00:20:23,903 --> 00:20:28,340
- Seven hundred.
- You always got time to argue money.

168
00:20:28,407 --> 00:20:30,466
All right.

169
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:37,515
I take it you can prove
that car is yours.

170
00:20:37,583 --> 00:20:40,780
I mean, out-of-state license.
You got your pink slip...

171
00:20:40,853 --> 00:20:44,084
I believe I have the necessary papers.
Is there a ladies room?

172
00:20:44,156 --> 00:20:46,989
In the building.

173
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,599
Over there.

174
00:21:55,961 --> 00:21:58,589
I think you better take it
for a trial spin.

175
00:21:58,664 --> 00:22:01,394
I don't want any bad word of mouth
about California Charlie.

176
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:04,402
I'd really rather not.
Can't we just settle this...

177
00:22:04,470 --> 00:22:08,770
I might as well be perfectly honest with
you. It's not that I don't trust you...

178
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:12,277
But what? Is there
anything so terribly wrong...

179
00:22:12,344 --> 00:22:14,869
about making a decision
and wanting to hurry?

180
00:22:14,947 --> 00:22:18,280
- Do you think I've stolen my car?
- No, ma'am.

181
00:22:18,350 --> 00:22:21,877
All right,
let's go inside.

182
00:22:58,123 --> 00:23:00,057
Hey!

183
00:23:06,699 --> 00:23:09,725
Just put it in here, please.

184
00:23:11,904 --> 00:23:14,065
Thank you.

185
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,515
Heck, Officer,
that was the first time...

186
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,347
I saw the customer
high pressure the salesman.

187
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:29,353
Somebody chasin' her?

188
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:32,356
I better have a look
at those papers, Charlie.

189
00:23:32,424 --> 00:23:36,622
- She look like a wrong one to you?
- Acted like one.

190
00:23:36,695 --> 00:23:40,893
The only funny thing,
she paid me $700 in cash.

191
00:23:48,874 --> 00:23:51,138
Yes, Mr. Lowery.

192
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:53,542
Caroline. Marion still isn't in?

193
00:23:53,612 --> 00:23:57,275
No, Mr. Lowery, but then she's always
a bit late on Monday mornings.

194
00:23:57,349 --> 00:24:00,807
Buzz me the minute
she comes in.

195
00:24:00,886 --> 00:24:04,219
And call her sister.
No one's answering at the house.

196
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:08,658
I called her sister where she works...
The Music Makers Music Store...

197
00:24:08,727 --> 00:24:11,525
and she doesn't know where Marion
is any more than we do.

198
00:24:11,597 --> 00:24:15,328
You better run out to the house. She may
be, well, unable to answer the phone.

199
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:18,733
Her sister's going to do that.
She's as worried as we are.

200
00:24:22,107 --> 00:24:24,803
No, I haven't the faintest idea.

201
00:24:24,877 --> 00:24:27,869
As I said, I last saw your sister
when she left this office on Friday.

202
00:24:27,946 --> 00:24:31,541
She said she didn't feel well and wanted
to leave early, and I said she could.

203
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:34,313
That was the last I saw...
Oh, wait a minute.

204
00:24:34,386 --> 00:24:37,719
I did see her
some time later driving...

205
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:41,851
Uh, I think you'd better come
over here to my office, quick.

206
00:24:41,927 --> 00:24:44,896
Caroline,
get Mr. Cassidy for me.

207
00:24:46,932 --> 00:24:51,130
After all, Cassidy,
I told you, all that cash!

208
00:24:51,203 --> 00:24:53,569
I'm not taking
the responsibility.

209
00:24:53,639 --> 00:24:58,099
Oh, for heaven's sake. A girl works
for you for ten years, you trust her.

210
00:24:58,177 --> 00:25:00,111
All right, yes,
you better come over.

211
00:25:02,181 --> 00:25:05,708
Well, I ain't about
to kiss off $40,000!

212
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:07,843
I'll get it back, and if any of it's
missin', I'll replace it...

213
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,854
with her fine, soft flesh!

214
00:25:09,922 --> 00:25:12,891
- We'll track her, never you doubt it.
- Hold on, Cassidy.

215
00:25:12,958 --> 00:25:18,191
I still can't believe... It must be
some kind of a mystery. l, I can't...

216
00:25:18,263 --> 00:25:21,528
You checked with the bank, no?
They never laid eyes on her, no?

217
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,730
You still trustin'? Hot creepers!
She sat there while I dumped it out!

218
00:25:25,804 --> 00:25:30,571
Hardly even looked at it. Plannin'.
And, and even flirtin' with me!

219
00:27:55,554 --> 00:28:00,753
Gee, I'm sorry I didn't hear you
in all this rain. Go ahead in, please.

220
00:28:05,597 --> 00:28:08,191
- Dirty night.
- Do you have a vacancy?

221
00:28:08,266 --> 00:28:12,532
Oh, we have 12 vacancies.
12 cabins, 12 vacancies.

222
00:28:12,604 --> 00:28:15,937
They, uh... They moved
away the highway.

223
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,842
Oh, I thought I'd gotten
off the main road.

224
00:28:19,911 --> 00:28:25,110
I knew you must have. Nobody ever stops
here anymore unless they've done that.

225
00:28:25,183 --> 00:28:29,085
But... there's no sense
dwelling on our losses.

226
00:28:29,154 --> 00:28:33,386
We just keep on lighting the lights
and following the formalities.

227
00:28:36,795 --> 00:28:40,754
Your home address.
Oh, just the town will do.

228
00:28:43,502 --> 00:28:46,403
Los Angeles.

229
00:28:52,511 --> 00:28:57,312
Cabin one. It's closer in case you want
anything. It's right next to the office.

230
00:28:57,382 --> 00:29:00,215
I want sleep more than anything else,
except maybe food.

231
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:03,686
There's a big diner about ten miles
up the road, just outside of Fairvale.

232
00:29:03,755 --> 00:29:08,488
- Am I that close to Fairvale?
- Fifteen miles. I'll get your bags.

233
00:29:27,512 --> 00:29:29,844
Boy, it's stuffy in here.

234
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,189
Well, the, uh, mattress
is soft and...

235
00:29:38,256 --> 00:29:40,486
there's hangers in the closet
and stationery...

236
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,493
with "Bates Motel"
printed on it...

237
00:29:42,561 --> 00:29:46,292
in case you wanna make your
friends back home feel envious.

238
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:48,355
And the, uh...

239
00:29:49,701 --> 00:29:52,431
- Over there.
- The bathroom.

240
00:29:52,504 --> 00:29:54,836
Yeah.

241
00:29:54,906 --> 00:29:59,240
Well, uh, i-i-if you want anything,
just... just tap on the wall.

242
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,245
- I'll be in the office.
- Thank you, Mr. Bates.

243
00:30:01,313 --> 00:30:03,804
Norman Bates.

244
00:30:06,251 --> 00:30:09,709
You're not really gonna go out again
and drive up to the diner, are you?

245
00:30:09,788 --> 00:30:12,222
- No.
- Then would you do me a favor?

246
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:13,985
Would you have dinner with me?

247
00:30:14,059 --> 00:30:18,587
I was just about to myself. Nothing
special... just sandwiches and milk.

248
00:30:18,663 --> 00:30:22,360
But I'd like it very much
if you'd come up to the house.

249
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:25,835
I don't set a fancy table,
but the kitchen's awful homey.

250
00:30:27,572 --> 00:30:29,540
- I'd like to.
- All right.

251
00:30:29,608 --> 00:30:32,338
You get yourself settled and,
and take off your wet shoes.

252
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:35,902
- I'll be back as soon as it's ready.
- Okay.

253
00:30:35,981 --> 00:30:39,576
With my... With my trusty umbrella.

254
00:31:59,397 --> 00:32:02,457
No! I tell you no!

255
00:32:02,534 --> 00:32:05,594
I won't have you bringing strange
young girls in for supper!

256
00:32:05,670 --> 00:32:09,538
By candlelight, I suppose,
in the cheap, erotic fashion...

257
00:32:09,608 --> 00:32:13,237
- of young men with cheap, erotic minds!
- Mother, please.

258
00:32:13,311 --> 00:32:16,678
And then what, after supper?
Music? Whispers?

259
00:32:16,748 --> 00:32:19,876
Mother, she's just a stranger.
She's hungry and it's raining out.

260
00:32:19,951 --> 00:32:25,412
"Mother, she's just a stranger." As if
men don't desire strangers. As if...

261
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:30,086
Oh! I refuse to speak of disgusting
things, because they disgust me!

262
00:32:30,161 --> 00:32:32,391
Do you understand, boy?
Go on.

263
00:32:32,464 --> 00:32:35,490
Go tell her she'll not be
appeasing her ugly appetite...

264
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:38,263
with my food or my son!

265
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:41,305
Or do I have to tell her
'cause you don't have the guts?

266
00:32:41,373 --> 00:32:45,901
- Huh, boy? You have the guts, boy?
- Shut up! Shut up!

267
00:33:27,218 --> 00:33:31,211
- I've caused you some trouble.
- No, uh...

268
00:33:31,289 --> 00:33:34,190
Mother...
My mother, uh...

269
00:33:34,259 --> 00:33:36,955
What is the phrase?

270
00:33:37,028 --> 00:33:40,259
She isn't quite
herself today.

271
00:33:40,332 --> 00:33:45,565
You shouldn't have bothered. I really
don't have that much of an appetite.

272
00:33:45,637 --> 00:33:48,333
Oh, I'm sorry.

273
00:33:50,075 --> 00:33:53,772
I wish you could apologize
for other people.

274
00:33:53,845 --> 00:33:55,779
Don't worry about it.

275
00:33:55,847 --> 00:33:59,783
But as long as you've fixed
the supper, we may as well eat it.

276
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:14,127
It, uh... It might be, uh, nicer
and warmer in the office.

277
00:34:27,579 --> 00:34:29,843
Well, it stopped
raining.

278
00:34:29,914 --> 00:34:33,873
Uh, eating in an office
is just... just too officious.

279
00:34:33,952 --> 00:34:36,887
- I have the parlor back here.
- All right.

280
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:55,263
- Sit down.
- Oh, thank you.

281
00:34:58,176 --> 00:35:01,509
You're very kind.

282
00:35:01,579 --> 00:35:05,345
It's all for you.
I'm not hungry. Go ahead.

283
00:35:10,688 --> 00:35:13,020
You... You eat like a bird.

284
00:35:14,626 --> 00:35:17,595
And you'd know,
of course.

285
00:35:17,662 --> 00:35:19,596
No, not really.

286
00:35:19,664 --> 00:35:23,122
Anyway, I hear the expression
"Eats like a bird"...

287
00:35:23,201 --> 00:35:27,695
is really a fal...
false... falsity.

288
00:35:27,772 --> 00:35:31,469
Because birds really
eat a tremendous lot.

289
00:35:33,478 --> 00:35:38,313
But I really don't know anything about
birds. My hobby is stuffing things.

290
00:35:38,383 --> 00:35:40,317
You know, taxidermy.

291
00:35:40,385 --> 00:35:44,947
And I guess I'd just rather
stuff birds because...

292
00:35:45,023 --> 00:35:47,423
I hate the look of beasts
when they're stuffed.

293
00:35:47,492 --> 00:35:49,483
You know,
foxes and chimps.

294
00:35:49,561 --> 00:35:53,691
Some people even stuff dogs and cats,
but, oh, I can't do that.

295
00:35:53,765 --> 00:35:57,166
I think only birds
look well stuffed because...

296
00:35:57,235 --> 00:36:00,932
Well, because they're kind
of passive to begin with.

297
00:36:01,005 --> 00:36:03,872
It's a strange hobby.
Curious.

298
00:36:03,942 --> 00:36:07,503
- Uncommon too.
- Oh, I imagine so.

299
00:36:07,579 --> 00:36:11,345
And it's... it's not as expensive
as you'd think. It's cheap, really.

300
00:36:11,416 --> 00:36:14,146
You know, needles
and thread, sawdust.

301
00:36:14,219 --> 00:36:16,687
The chemicals are the only
thing that, that cost anything.

302
00:36:16,754 --> 00:36:19,746
A man should have a hobby.

303
00:36:19,824 --> 00:36:23,726
Well, it's...
it's more than a hobby.

304
00:36:25,864 --> 00:36:29,061
A hobby's supposed to
pass the time, not fill it.

305
00:36:29,133 --> 00:36:32,068
Is your time so empty?

306
00:36:32,136 --> 00:36:34,798
No. Uh...

307
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:37,000
Well, I run the office...

308
00:36:37,075 --> 00:36:39,407
and tend the cabins
and grounds...

309
00:36:39,477 --> 00:36:42,344
and do little, uh,
errands for my mother...

310
00:36:42,413 --> 00:36:45,211
the ones she allows
I might be capable of doing.

311
00:36:45,283 --> 00:36:48,411
Do you go out with friends?

312
00:36:50,355 --> 00:36:53,256
Well, a boy's best friend
is his mother.

313
00:36:55,727 --> 00:37:00,221
You've never had an empty moment
in your entire life, have you?

314
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:07,064
- Only my share.
- Where are you going?

315
00:37:07,138 --> 00:37:09,606
I didn't mean to pry.

316
00:37:09,674 --> 00:37:12,404
I'm looking for
a private island.

317
00:37:14,546 --> 00:37:17,379
What are you
running away from?

318
00:37:19,284 --> 00:37:23,243
- Why do you ask that?
- No.

319
00:37:23,321 --> 00:37:25,755
People never run away
from anything.

320
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:32,519
The rain didn't last long,
did it? You know what I think?

321
00:37:32,597 --> 00:37:35,191
I think that...

322
00:37:37,001 --> 00:37:39,196
we're all in
our private traps,

323
00:37:40,705 --> 00:37:44,539
clamped in them, and none of us
can ever get out.

324
00:37:46,344 --> 00:37:48,539
We scratch and...
and claw,

325
00:37:48,613 --> 00:37:52,549
but only at the air,
only at each other.

326
00:37:52,617 --> 00:37:57,486
And for all of it,
we never budge an inch.

327
00:37:57,555 --> 00:38:00,046
Sometimes we deliberately
step into those traps.

328
00:38:03,261 --> 00:38:05,695
I was born in mine.
I don't mind it anymore.

329
00:38:05,763 --> 00:38:09,130
Oh, but you should.
You should mind it.

330
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:11,668
Oh, I do, but I say I don't.

331
00:38:14,672 --> 00:38:18,904
You know, if anyone ever talked
to me the way I heard...

332
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:22,640
the way she spoke to you...

333
00:38:22,714 --> 00:38:26,741
Sometimes when she talks
to me like that,

334
00:38:26,818 --> 00:38:31,221
I feel I'd like to go up there and
curse her and, and leave her forever.

335
00:38:31,289 --> 00:38:33,723
Or at least defy her.

336
00:38:38,463 --> 00:38:42,524
But I know I can't.
She's ill.

337
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:46,661
She sounded strong.

338
00:38:46,738 --> 00:38:49,298
No, I mean... ill.

339
00:38:50,875 --> 00:38:54,641
She had to raise me all by herself,
after my father died.

340
00:38:54,712 --> 00:38:58,409
I was only five and it,
it must've been quite a strain for her.

341
00:38:58,483 --> 00:39:02,351
I mean, she didn't have to go to work or
anything. He left her a little money.

342
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:07,084
Anyway, a few years ago,
Mother met this man.

343
00:39:07,158 --> 00:39:10,559
And he... he talked her
into building this motel.

344
00:39:10,628 --> 00:39:13,654
He could have talked her
into anything.

345
00:39:13,731 --> 00:39:17,827
And when he died too, it was
just too great a shock for her.

346
00:39:19,237 --> 00:39:21,228
And the way
he died...

347
00:39:22,874 --> 00:39:27,675
I guess it's nothing to talk about
while you're eating.

348
00:39:27,745 --> 00:39:32,375
Anyway, it was just too great
a loss for her. She had nothing left.

349
00:39:32,450 --> 00:39:34,816
Except you.

350
00:39:34,886 --> 00:39:38,151
Well, a son is a poor substitute
for a lover.

351
00:39:40,224 --> 00:39:42,692
Why don't you go away?

352
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:44,990
To a private island,
like you?

353
00:39:48,266 --> 00:39:51,895
No... not like me.

354
00:39:51,969 --> 00:39:56,133
I couldn't do that.
Who'd look after her?

355
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:59,040
She'd be alone up there.

356
00:40:00,912 --> 00:40:03,278
The fire would go out.

357
00:40:03,347 --> 00:40:07,181
It'd be cold and damp
like a grave.

358
00:40:07,251 --> 00:40:11,620
If you love someone, you don't do that
to them, even if you hate them.

359
00:40:13,524 --> 00:40:17,790
You understand, l...
I don't hate her.

360
00:40:17,862 --> 00:40:21,958
I hate what she's become.
I hate the illness.

361
00:40:24,235 --> 00:40:29,195
Wouldn't it be better
if you put her... some place?

362
00:40:33,411 --> 00:40:36,778
You mean an institution?
A madhouse?

363
00:40:39,117 --> 00:40:44,111
People always call a madhouse
"some place," don't they?

364
00:40:44,188 --> 00:40:46,122
Put her in "some place."

365
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,793
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it
to sound uncaring.

366
00:40:50,862 --> 00:40:53,296
What do you know
about caring?

367
00:40:53,364 --> 00:40:56,561
Have you ever seen the inside
of one of those places?

368
00:40:56,634 --> 00:41:00,365
The laughing and the tears...

369
00:41:00,438 --> 00:41:02,804
and the cruel eyes
studying you.

370
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:04,842
My mother there?

371
00:41:06,878 --> 00:41:09,904
But she's harmless.

372
00:41:11,482 --> 00:41:14,417
She's as harmless as one
of those stuffed birds.

373
00:41:16,287 --> 00:41:18,278
I am sorry.

374
00:41:18,356 --> 00:41:22,520
I only felt...
It seems she's hurting you.

375
00:41:24,095 --> 00:41:28,191
- I meant well.
- People always mean well.

376
00:41:28,266 --> 00:41:31,895
They cluck their thick tongues
and shake their heads and suggest...

377
00:41:31,969 --> 00:41:34,028
oh, so very delicately...

378
00:41:40,645 --> 00:41:44,843
Of course,
I've suggested it myself.

379
00:41:44,916 --> 00:41:49,353
But I hate to even think about it.
She needs me.

380
00:41:53,958 --> 00:41:58,657
It... It's not as if she were
a... a maniac, a raving thing.

381
00:41:58,729 --> 00:42:01,289
She...

382
00:42:01,365 --> 00:42:04,459
She just goes
a little mad sometimes.

383
00:42:06,604 --> 00:42:09,869
We all go a little mad
sometimes.

384
00:42:11,275 --> 00:42:13,971
Haven't you?

385
00:42:16,013 --> 00:42:18,140
Yes.

386
00:42:18,216 --> 00:42:23,483
Sometimes just one time
can be enough. Thank you.

387
00:42:24,689 --> 00:42:26,657
Thank you, "Norman."

388
00:42:26,724 --> 00:42:29,522
Norman.

389
00:42:29,594 --> 00:42:33,030
Oh, you're not... you're not
going back to your room already?

390
00:42:33,097 --> 00:42:35,861
I'm very tired.

391
00:42:35,933 --> 00:42:38,993
And I have a long drive tomorrow,
all the way back to Phoenix.

392
00:42:39,070 --> 00:42:40,867
Really?

393
00:42:40,938 --> 00:42:44,305
I stepped into a private trap
back there...

394
00:42:44,375 --> 00:42:48,903
and I'd like to go back and try
to pull myself out of it...

395
00:42:50,581 --> 00:42:53,015
before it's too late
for me too.

396
00:42:53,084 --> 00:42:56,520
Are you sure you wouldn't like
to stay a little while longer?

397
00:42:56,587 --> 00:43:00,250
- I mean, just for talk.
- Oh, I'd like to, but...

398
00:43:00,324 --> 00:43:02,758
All right. Well,
I'll see you in the morning.

399
00:43:02,827 --> 00:43:04,761
I'll bring you some breakfast,
all right?

400
00:43:04,829 --> 00:43:07,889
- What time?
- Very early. Dawn.

401
00:43:07,965 --> 00:43:10,195
All right, Miss, uh...

402
00:43:10,268 --> 00:43:12,259
- Crane.
- Crane. That's it.

403
00:43:12,336 --> 00:43:14,531
Good night.

404
00:47:21,485 --> 00:47:24,852
Ow! No!

405
00:47:24,922 --> 00:47:27,288
No! Aaah!

406
00:49:29,513 --> 00:49:31,845
Mother! Oh, God, Mother!

407
00:49:31,915 --> 00:49:35,476
Blood! Blood!

408
01:00:01,044 --> 01:00:03,478
I've tried many brands.

409
01:00:03,546 --> 01:00:07,312
So far, of those I've used, I haven't
had much luck with any of them.

410
01:00:07,384 --> 01:00:10,319
Let's see what they say
about this one.

411
01:00:10,387 --> 01:00:12,821
They tell you
what its ingredients are...

412
01:00:12,889 --> 01:00:16,825
and how it's guaranteed to exterminate
every insect in the world,

413
01:00:16,893 --> 01:00:19,760
but they do not tell you
whether it's painless.

414
01:00:19,829 --> 01:00:23,663
And I say, insect or man,
death should always be painless.

415
01:00:23,733 --> 01:00:27,669
This one seems to claim more and better
qualities than lots of the others.

416
01:00:39,115 --> 01:00:41,447
Sam?

417
01:00:41,518 --> 01:00:44,544
Sam!
Lady wants to see ya.

418
01:00:50,493 --> 01:00:53,018
- Yes, miss?
- I'm Marion's sister.

419
01:00:53,096 --> 01:00:55,826
- Oh, sure. Lila.
- Is Marion here?

420
01:00:57,567 --> 01:01:00,229
- Well, of course not. Something wrong?
- Thank you.

421
01:01:04,107 --> 01:01:06,200
She left home on Friday.

422
01:01:06,276 --> 01:01:09,768
I was in Tucson over the weekend
and I haven't heard from her since.

423
01:01:09,846 --> 01:01:12,337
Not even a phone call.

424
01:01:12,415 --> 01:01:15,851
If you two are in this together,
it's none of my business,

425
01:01:15,919 --> 01:01:19,082
but I want Marion to tell me it's none
of my business and then I'll go...

426
01:01:19,155 --> 01:01:22,682
Bob, run out and get yourself
some lunch, will ya?

427
01:01:22,759 --> 01:01:25,785
- That's okay. I brought it with me.
- Run out and eat it.

428
01:01:30,633 --> 01:01:34,729
Now, what thing
could we be in together?

429
01:01:34,804 --> 01:01:36,931
Sorry about the tears.

430
01:01:37,007 --> 01:01:40,272
Well, is Marion in trouble?
What is it?

431
01:01:40,343 --> 01:01:43,278
Let's all talk about
Marion, shall we?

432
01:01:46,883 --> 01:01:48,817
Who are you, friend?

433
01:01:48,885 --> 01:01:51,149
My name is Arbogast, friend.

434
01:01:51,221 --> 01:01:54,054
I'm a private investigator.

435
01:01:54,124 --> 01:01:57,753
- Where is she, Miss Crane?
- I don't know you.

436
01:01:57,827 --> 01:02:01,854
I know you don't, because if you did
I wouldn't be able to follow you.

437
01:02:01,931 --> 01:02:04,365
What's your interest
in this?

438
01:02:04,434 --> 01:02:07,562
Well, $40,000.

439
01:02:08,905 --> 01:02:10,839
- $40,000?
- That's right.

440
01:02:14,210 --> 01:02:18,078
One of you'd better tell me what's going
on, and fast. I can take so much...

441
01:02:18,148 --> 01:02:20,082
Now, take it easy,
friend.

442
01:02:20,150 --> 01:02:23,916
It's just that your girlfriend
stole $40,000.

443
01:02:23,987 --> 01:02:26,421
What are you talking about?
What is this?

444
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:30,983
She was supposed to bank it on Friday
for her boss, and she didn't.

445
01:02:31,061 --> 01:02:34,258
- No one has seen her since.
- Someone has seen her.

446
01:02:34,330 --> 01:02:36,855
Someone always sees a girl
with $40,000.

447
01:02:36,933 --> 01:02:40,300
They don't want to prosecute,
they just want the money back.

448
01:02:40,370 --> 01:02:43,305
- Sam, if she's here...
- She isn't. She isn't.

449
01:02:43,373 --> 01:02:47,173
Miss Crane, can I ask you, did you come
up here on a hunch and nothing more?

450
01:02:47,243 --> 01:02:50,144
Oh, not even a hunch.
Just hope.

451
01:02:50,213 --> 01:02:53,944
Well, with a little checking
I could get to believe you.

452
01:02:54,017 --> 01:02:56,952
I don't care
if you believe me or not.

453
01:02:57,020 --> 01:03:00,148
All I want to do is see Marion
before she gets in this too deeply.

454
01:03:00,223 --> 01:03:03,192
Did you check Phoenix?
Maybe she had an accident, or a holdup.

455
01:03:03,259 --> 01:03:08,390
No, she was seen leaving town in her
own car... by her employer, I might add.

456
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:11,025
I can't believe it.
Can you?

457
01:03:12,569 --> 01:03:15,003
We're always quickest
to doubt people...

458
01:03:15,071 --> 01:03:17,562
who have a reputation
for being honest.

459
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,904
I think she's here,
Miss Crane.

460
01:03:19,976 --> 01:03:22,410
Where there's
a boyfriend...

461
01:03:22,479 --> 01:03:27,416
She's not back there with the nuts and
bolts, but she's in this town somewhere.

462
01:03:27,484 --> 01:03:30,419
I'll find her.
I'll be seeing you.

463
01:04:07,190 --> 01:04:09,124
- Evening.
- Evening.

464
01:04:09,192 --> 01:04:11,126
I almost drove
right past.

465
01:04:11,194 --> 01:04:14,459
I'm always forgetting to turn
the sign on, but we do have a vacancy.

466
01:04:14,531 --> 01:04:17,398
Twelve, in fact.
Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.

467
01:04:17,467 --> 01:04:19,401
- Candy?
- No, thanks.

468
01:04:19,469 --> 01:04:23,405
Last two days I've been to so many
motels my eyes are bleary with neon,

469
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:26,909
but this is the first place that looks
like it's hiding from the world.

470
01:04:26,976 --> 01:04:29,911
To tell the truth, I didn't
really forget to turn the sign on.

471
01:04:29,979 --> 01:04:32,914
-Just doesn't seem like any use anymore.
-Oh?

472
01:04:32,982 --> 01:04:36,418
See, that used to be
the main highway right there.

473
01:04:36,486 --> 01:04:39,421
- Wanna register?
- Sit down. I don't wanna trouble you.

474
01:04:39,489 --> 01:04:42,424
- I just wanna ask a few questions.
- No trouble. Today's linen day.

475
01:04:42,492 --> 01:04:45,427
I always change the beds once a week
whether they've been used or not.

476
01:04:45,495 --> 01:04:50,057
Hate the smell of dampness. It's such a,
I don't know... creepy smell.

477
01:04:51,367 --> 01:04:53,358
You out to buy a motel?

478
01:04:54,871 --> 01:04:56,805
No.

479
01:04:56,873 --> 01:04:59,569
Reason I ask, you said you'd seen
so many the past couple of days,

480
01:04:59,642 --> 01:05:01,439
I thought maybe...

481
01:05:01,511 --> 01:05:04,446
What, uh... What was it
you wanted to ask?

482
01:05:04,514 --> 01:05:07,074
I'm looking for
a missing person.

483
01:05:07,150 --> 01:05:10,119
My name's Arbogast.
I'm a private investigator.

484
01:05:10,186 --> 01:05:12,620
I've been trying
to trace a girl...

485
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:16,125
that's been missing for,
oh, about a week now from Phoenix.

486
01:05:16,192 --> 01:05:19,059
It's a private matter.
The family wants to forgive her.

487
01:05:19,128 --> 01:05:21,062
She's not
in any trouble.

488
01:05:21,130 --> 01:05:24,065
I didn't think the police went looking
for people who aren't in trouble.

489
01:05:24,133 --> 01:05:26,192
- I'm not the police.
- Oh, yeah.

490
01:05:26,269 --> 01:05:30,797
We have reason to believe she came
along this way. Did she stop here?

491
01:05:30,873 --> 01:05:33,808
No one's stopped here
for a couple of weeks.

492
01:05:33,876 --> 01:05:35,810
Mind looking at the picture
before committing yourself?

493
01:05:35,878 --> 01:05:37,368
Commit myself?

494
01:05:37,447 --> 01:05:40,780
- You sure talk like a policeman.
- Look at the picture, please.

495
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:44,445
- Mm-mmm. Yeah.
- Sure?

496
01:05:45,521 --> 01:05:47,455
Well, she may have
used an alias.

497
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:49,457
Marion Crane's
her real name,

498
01:05:49,525 --> 01:05:52,961
but she could've registered
under a different one.

499
01:05:53,029 --> 01:05:57,159
I tell ya, I don't even much bother
with guests registering anymore.

500
01:05:57,233 --> 01:06:00,168
One by one,
you drop the formalities.

501
01:06:00,236 --> 01:06:04,195
I shouldn't even bother changing
the sheets, but old habits die hard.

502
01:06:04,274 --> 01:06:07,107
Which reminds me...

503
01:06:08,011 --> 01:06:09,911
- What's that?
- The sign.

504
01:06:09,979 --> 01:06:13,312
A couple last week said
if the thing hadn't been on,

505
01:06:13,383 --> 01:06:16,318
they would've thought
this was an old, deserted...

506
01:06:16,386 --> 01:06:18,547
You see,
that's exactly my point.

507
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:21,055
Nobody'd been here
for a couple weeks,

508
01:06:21,124 --> 01:06:25,060
and there's a couple came by
and didn't know that you were open.

509
01:06:25,128 --> 01:06:27,187
As you say,
old habits die hard.

510
01:06:27,263 --> 01:06:31,097
This girl could've registered
under another name. Mind if I look?

511
01:06:31,167 --> 01:06:33,397
- No.
- Thank you.

512
01:06:35,104 --> 01:06:37,436
All right.

513
01:06:37,507 --> 01:06:41,273
I'll get the date
somewhere. Mm-hmm.

514
01:06:41,344 --> 01:06:43,835
See, there's nobody.

515
01:06:43,913 --> 01:06:47,349
Let's see, I have a sample
of her handwriting here.

516
01:06:48,685 --> 01:06:50,619
Oh, yes.

517
01:06:50,687 --> 01:06:52,621
Here we are.

518
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:54,623
- Marie Samuels.
- Hmm.

519
01:06:54,691 --> 01:06:56,625
That's an interesting alias.

520
01:06:56,693 --> 01:06:59,127
- Is that her?
- Yeah, I think so.

521
01:06:59,195 --> 01:07:01,129
Marie, Marion.

522
01:07:01,197 --> 01:07:04,360
- Samuels. Her boyfriend's name is Sam.
- Mm-hmm.

523
01:07:04,434 --> 01:07:09,235
Mm-hmm. Was she
in disguise, by any chance?

524
01:07:09,305 --> 01:07:12,934
- Wanna check the picture again?
- I wasn't lying to you.

525
01:07:13,009 --> 01:07:15,944
Oh, I know that.
I know you wouldn't lie.

526
01:07:16,012 --> 01:07:17,877
It's tough keeping track
of the time around here.

527
01:07:17,947 --> 01:07:19,278
I know.

528
01:07:19,349 --> 01:07:21,408
Oh, yeah.

529
01:07:21,484 --> 01:07:26,649
Well, i-i-it was raining
and, um, her hair was all wet.

530
01:07:26,723 --> 01:07:28,657
I tell ya, it's not really
a very good picture of her.

531
01:07:28,725 --> 01:07:30,386
No, I guess not.

532
01:07:30,460 --> 01:07:32,394
Tell me all about her.

533
01:07:32,462 --> 01:07:34,555
Well, um,

534
01:07:34,630 --> 01:07:38,760
she arrived, um, rather late
one night, went straight to sleep...

535
01:07:38,835 --> 01:07:41,395
and, uh, left early
the next morning.

536
01:07:41,471 --> 01:07:44,599
- How early?
- Oh, ex... very early.

537
01:07:44,674 --> 01:07:47,905
Mm-hmm.
Which morning was that?

538
01:07:47,977 --> 01:07:49,911
Uh, the, um...

539
01:07:49,979 --> 01:07:53,244
Th-Th-Th-The next morning.

540
01:07:53,316 --> 01:07:55,614
- Sunday.
- I see. Mm-hmm.

541
01:07:55,685 --> 01:07:57,619
- Did anyone meet her here?
- No.

542
01:07:57,687 --> 01:08:00,417
- Did she arrive with anyone?
- No.

543
01:08:00,490 --> 01:08:03,288
- Did she make any phone calls or...
- No.

544
01:08:03,359 --> 01:08:05,293
- Locally?
- Uh-uh.

545
01:08:05,361 --> 01:08:09,297
- Did you spend the night with her?
- No.

546
01:08:09,365 --> 01:08:12,630
Then how would you know
she didn't make any calls?

547
01:08:14,871 --> 01:08:16,930
Uh, w-w...

548
01:08:17,006 --> 01:08:19,270
Well, she was very tired
a-and, uh...

549
01:08:19,342 --> 01:08:22,106
See, l... N-Now I'm staring
to, um... remember.

550
01:08:22,178 --> 01:08:24,646
l-I'm making a mental picture
of it in my mind.

551
01:08:24,714 --> 01:08:27,774
- If you make a mental picturization...
- Right. Take your time.

552
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:31,047
Um, she was...
she was sitting back there...

553
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,055
N-No, she was standing back there
with a sandwich in her hand.

554
01:08:34,123 --> 01:08:37,058
She said she had to
go to sleep early...

555
01:08:37,126 --> 01:08:41,256
because she had a long d-d-dr-drive,
uh, ahead of her.

556
01:08:41,330 --> 01:08:44,060
- Mm-hmm. Back where?
- Back where she came from.

557
01:08:44,133 --> 01:08:46,829
No, you said before she
was standing back there...

558
01:08:46,903 --> 01:08:48,837
Yes, b-back in my parlor.

559
01:08:48,905 --> 01:08:51,840
She was very hungry,
I made her a sandwich...

560
01:08:51,908 --> 01:08:56,845
and then she said she was tired and
she, uh, um, had to go r-right to bed.

561
01:08:56,913 --> 01:08:58,847
I see.
How did she pay you?

562
01:08:58,915 --> 01:09:00,678
- Cash? Check?
- Cash.

563
01:09:00,750 --> 01:09:02,684
Cash, huh?
Mm-hmm.

564
01:09:02,752 --> 01:09:07,212
- After she left, she didn't come back?
- Uh-uh. Why should she?

565
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:11,852
Hmm.

566
01:09:11,928 --> 01:09:15,364
Well, M-Mr. Arbogast, uh,
I guess that's about it.

567
01:09:15,431 --> 01:09:18,992
l-I've got some work to do,
if you don't mind.

568
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,003
To tell you the truth,
I do mind.

569
01:09:22,071 --> 01:09:25,472
See, if it doesn't jell,
it isn't aspic, and this ain't jelling.

570
01:09:25,541 --> 01:09:28,476
It's not coming together.
Something's missing.

571
01:09:28,544 --> 01:09:32,002
Well, l-l-I don't know
what you c-could expect me to know.

572
01:09:32,081 --> 01:09:34,015
People just come and go,
you know.

573
01:09:34,083 --> 01:09:36,517
That's right.
She isn't still here, is she?

574
01:09:36,586 --> 01:09:38,383
No.

575
01:09:38,454 --> 01:09:44,051
If I wanted to check the cabins, all
twelve, I'd need a warrant, wouldn't I?

576
01:09:44,126 --> 01:09:47,562
If you don't believe me, come on
with me. You can help me change beds.

577
01:09:47,630 --> 01:09:49,621
Oh. No, thanks.

578
01:10:06,616 --> 01:10:08,550
Uh, change your mind?

579
01:10:10,253 --> 01:10:12,187
Oh.

580
01:10:12,255 --> 01:10:16,055
You know, l... I think I have one of
those faces you can't help believing.

581
01:10:16,125 --> 01:10:17,990
- Is anyone at home?
- No.

582
01:10:18,060 --> 01:10:20,654
Oh? There's somebody
sitting in the window.

583
01:10:20,730 --> 01:10:22,823
- N-N-No, there isn't.
- Sure. Take a look.

584
01:10:22,899 --> 01:10:24,890
Oh, th-that must be
my mother.

585
01:10:24,967 --> 01:10:27,401
She's an, uh, "inavlid..."
an invalid.

586
01:10:27,470 --> 01:10:29,938
Uh, it's practically
like living alone.

587
01:10:30,006 --> 01:10:32,099
Oh, I see.

588
01:10:32,174 --> 01:10:36,907
If this girl, Marion Crane, were here,
you wouldn't be hiding her, would you?

589
01:10:36,979 --> 01:10:39,413
- No.
- Not even if she paid you well?

590
01:10:39,482 --> 01:10:41,507
No.

591
01:10:41,584 --> 01:10:46,351
Let's say, for the sake of argument,
she wanted you to gallantly protect her.

592
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:48,481
You'd know
you were being used.

593
01:10:48,558 --> 01:10:51,550
- You wouldn't be made a fool of.
- I'm not a fool.

594
01:10:51,627 --> 01:10:54,187
And I'm not capable of being fooled,
not even by a woman.

595
01:10:54,263 --> 01:10:57,198
- This is not a slur on your manhood.
- Let's put it this way.

596
01:10:57,266 --> 01:11:00,702
She might have fooled me,
but she didn't fool my mother.

597
01:11:00,770 --> 01:11:03,705
Then your mother met her.
Could I talk to your mother?

598
01:11:03,773 --> 01:11:05,832
No. As I told you,
she's confined.

599
01:11:05,908 --> 01:11:09,674
Just for a few minutes. There might be
some hint that you missed out on.

600
01:11:09,745 --> 01:11:12,908
Sick old women
are usually pretty sharp.

601
01:11:12,982 --> 01:11:14,916
- I wouldn't disturb her.
- Mr. Arbogast, l-I think I've...

602
01:11:14,984 --> 01:11:18,442
- I think I've talked to you all I want.
- Yes, but just for...

603
01:11:18,521 --> 01:11:21,456
It'd be much better
if you left now. Thanks.

604
01:11:21,524 --> 01:11:23,549
Well, all right.

605
01:11:23,626 --> 01:11:27,494
You sure would save me a lot of
leg work if you'd let me talk to her.

606
01:11:27,563 --> 01:11:30,691
- Would I need a warrant for that too?
- Sure.

607
01:11:30,766 --> 01:11:32,700
All right.
Thanks, anyway.

608
01:12:27,056 --> 01:12:30,492
Hello, Loomis.
This is Arbogast. Is Lila there?

609
01:12:30,559 --> 01:12:32,993
Let me talk to her, please.

610
01:12:34,330 --> 01:12:36,423
Hello, Lila.

611
01:12:36,499 --> 01:12:40,230
Lila, listen.
Marion was up here.

612
01:12:40,302 --> 01:12:43,237
Yes, she spent last Saturday night
at the Bates Motel.

613
01:12:43,305 --> 01:12:45,239
It's out
on the old highway.

614
01:12:45,307 --> 01:12:48,799
I even know what cabin she was in...
it was number one.

615
01:12:48,878 --> 01:12:53,178
Well, this young fella that runs
the place said she just spent the night,

616
01:12:53,249 --> 01:12:55,945
left the next day
and that was it.

617
01:12:56,018 --> 01:12:59,454
Mmm.
Um, no, not exactly.

618
01:13:01,223 --> 01:13:03,157
Well, I did question him,
believe me,

619
01:13:03,225 --> 01:13:06,160
but I think I got
all there was to get.

620
01:13:06,228 --> 01:13:09,163
I'll just have to pick up
the pieces from here.

621
01:13:09,231 --> 01:13:12,667
Well, I tell ya,
I don't feel entirely satisfied, uh...

622
01:13:12,735 --> 01:13:15,670
See, this boy
had a sick old mother.

623
01:13:15,738 --> 01:13:18,605
I think she saw Marion
and talked to her.

624
01:13:18,674 --> 01:13:22,007
No. No, unfortunately,
he wouldn't let me see her.

625
01:13:22,078 --> 01:13:26,572
Well, I was, but I think I'll go
back to the motel first.

626
01:13:26,649 --> 01:13:30,415
No, you stay there with Loomis.
I'll be back in about an hour.

627
01:13:30,486 --> 01:13:32,420
All right, fine.
Listen, l...

628
01:13:32,488 --> 01:13:35,423
You'll be happy to know
what I think.

629
01:13:35,491 --> 01:13:39,427
Uh, I think our friend Sam Loomis
didn't know that Marion was here.

630
01:13:40,930 --> 01:13:43,865
All right. See ya
in about an hour... or less.

631
01:13:43,933 --> 01:13:45,867
All right, bye-bye.

632
01:14:41,490 --> 01:14:43,424
Bates?

633
01:17:16,645 --> 01:17:20,843
Sometimes Saturday night has a Ionely
sound. Ever notice that, Lila?

634
01:17:22,785 --> 01:17:25,720
Sam, he said
an hour or less.

635
01:17:25,788 --> 01:17:28,018
Yeah.

636
01:17:28,090 --> 01:17:30,024
It's been three.

637
01:17:30,092 --> 01:17:32,219
Are we just
going to sit here and wait?

638
01:17:32,294 --> 01:17:34,421
He'll be back.

639
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:36,987
Let's sit still
and hang on, okay?

640
01:17:41,904 --> 01:17:45,340
- How far is the old highway?
- You wanna go out there, don't you?

641
01:17:45,407 --> 01:17:47,841
- Bust in on Arbogast and the old lady.
- Yes.

642
01:17:47,910 --> 01:17:50,208
- Maybe shake her up.
- Yes!

643
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:53,214
- That wouldn't be wise.
- Patience doesn't run in my family.

644
01:17:53,282 --> 01:17:55,216
- I'm going out there.
- Arbogast said...

645
01:17:55,284 --> 01:17:57,218
An hour, or less.

646
01:18:00,856 --> 01:18:02,790
Well, I'm going.

647
01:18:02,858 --> 01:18:04,792
You'll never find it.

648
01:18:07,997 --> 01:18:10,431
- Stay here.
- Why can't I go?

649
01:18:10,499 --> 01:18:14,435
I don't know. One of us has to be here,
in case he's on the way.

650
01:18:14,503 --> 01:18:16,937
What am I supposed to do,
just sit here and wait?

651
01:18:17,006 --> 01:18:18,598
Yeah. Stay here.

652
01:18:38,861 --> 01:18:40,795
Arbogast?

653
01:18:41,864 --> 01:18:43,798
Arbogast!

654
01:18:46,635 --> 01:18:48,569
Arbogast!

655
01:19:17,866 --> 01:19:20,460
- He didn't come back here?
- Sam!

656
01:19:20,536 --> 01:19:23,869
No Arbogast, no Bates.
Only the old lady at home.

657
01:19:23,939 --> 01:19:27,204
Sick old lady unable to answer
the door... or unwilling.

658
01:19:27,276 --> 01:19:29,210
Where could he
have gone?

659
01:19:29,278 --> 01:19:31,212
Maybe he got
some definite lead.

660
01:19:31,280 --> 01:19:33,214
- Maybe he went right on.
- Without calling me?

661
01:19:33,282 --> 01:19:35,216
- In a hurry.
- Sam, he called...

662
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:37,218
when he had nothing
but a dissatisfied feeling.

663
01:19:37,286 --> 01:19:41,222
Don't you think he'd have called
if he had anything at all?

664
01:19:41,290 --> 01:19:43,224
Yes, I think
he would've.

665
01:19:43,292 --> 01:19:45,487
- Let's go see Al Chambers.
- Who's he?

666
01:19:45,561 --> 01:19:48,997
- Our deputy sheriff around here.
- Let me get my coat.

667
01:19:57,239 --> 01:19:59,173
Good evening.

668
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:03,337
Well, l... I don't know where to start,
except at the beginning.

669
01:20:03,412 --> 01:20:05,346
Yes.

670
01:20:05,414 --> 01:20:08,349
- This is Lila Crane from Phoenix.
- How do you do?

671
01:20:08,417 --> 01:20:11,352
She's been here
searching for her sister.

672
01:20:11,420 --> 01:20:13,354
There's this
private detective helping.

673
01:20:13,422 --> 01:20:16,084
We got a call from this
detective... he'd traced her...

674
01:20:16,158 --> 01:20:18,092
to that motel
on the old highway.

675
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:20,094
That must be
the Bates Motel.

676
01:20:20,162 --> 01:20:23,222
He called to say he was going
to question Mrs. Bates.

677
01:20:23,298 --> 01:20:25,232
Norman took a wife?

678
01:20:25,300 --> 01:20:28,736
No, l-I don't think so.
An old woman. His mother.

679
01:20:28,804 --> 01:20:31,796
That was early this evening. We
haven't seen or heard from him since.

680
01:20:31,874 --> 01:20:35,469
Now, your sister's
missing how long?

681
01:20:35,544 --> 01:20:38,604
She left Phoenix a week ago
yesterday without a trace.

682
01:20:38,680 --> 01:20:42,343
How'd you and this detective come
to trace her to Fairvale?

683
01:20:42,417 --> 01:20:44,578
They thought
she'd be coming to me.

684
01:20:44,653 --> 01:20:47,087
- Left Phoenix under her own steam?
- Yes.

685
01:20:47,156 --> 01:20:49,090
She's not missing so much
as she's run away.

686
01:20:49,158 --> 01:20:51,092
That's right.

687
01:20:51,160 --> 01:20:53,094
From what?

688
01:20:54,863 --> 01:20:56,797
She stole some money.

689
01:20:56,865 --> 01:20:58,856
A lot?

690
01:20:58,934 --> 01:21:00,868
Forty thousand dollars.

691
01:21:00,936 --> 01:21:02,961
The police haven't
been able to...

692
01:21:03,038 --> 01:21:06,633
Everyone concerned thought if they
could get her to give the money back,

693
01:21:06,708 --> 01:21:09,643
they could avoid involving her
with the police.

694
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:11,645
That explains
the private detective.

695
01:21:11,713 --> 01:21:13,704
He traced her
to the Bates place.

696
01:21:13,782 --> 01:21:16,717
What exactly did he say
when he called you?

697
01:21:16,785 --> 01:21:20,084
He said Marion was there
for one night, then she left.

698
01:21:20,155 --> 01:21:22,089
- With the $40,000?
- He didn't say anything...

699
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,591
about the money.

700
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:27,094
It isn't important
what he said, is it?

701
01:21:27,162 --> 01:21:30,928
He was supposed to come talk to us after
he talked to the mother, and he didn't.

702
01:21:30,999 --> 01:21:32,933
That's what I want you
to do something about.

703
01:21:33,001 --> 01:21:34,468
Like what?

704
01:21:34,536 --> 01:21:36,970
I'm sorry if I seem overanxious.

705
01:21:37,039 --> 01:21:40,770
I'm sure there's something wrong
out there, and I have to know what.

706
01:21:40,842 --> 01:21:44,608
Well, I think there's something wrong
too, Miss, but not the same thing.

707
01:21:44,680 --> 01:21:47,615
I think what's wrong
is your private detective.

708
01:21:47,683 --> 01:21:51,779
I think he got himself a hot lead
as to where your sister was goin',

709
01:21:51,853 --> 01:21:53,821
probably from Norman Bates,

710
01:21:53,889 --> 01:21:57,188
and called you to keep you still while
he took off after her and the money.

711
01:21:57,259 --> 01:22:01,696
No, no, he said he was dissatisfied
and he was going back there.

712
01:22:01,763 --> 01:22:03,697
Call Norman and let him
say what happened.

713
01:22:03,765 --> 01:22:05,699
At this hour?

714
01:22:05,767 --> 01:22:10,431
He was out when I was there a while ago.
If he's back, he probably isn't in bed.

715
01:22:10,505 --> 01:22:13,372
He wasn't out; he just wasn't answerin'
the door in the dead of night,

716
01:22:13,442 --> 01:22:15,376
like some people do.

717
01:22:15,444 --> 01:22:18,311
This fellow lives
like a hermit.

718
01:22:18,380 --> 01:22:21,178
You must remember that bad business
out there about ten years ago.

719
01:22:21,250 --> 01:22:23,184
Please. Call.

720
01:22:28,690 --> 01:22:32,854
Florrie, the sheriff wants you
to connect him with the Bates Motel.

721
01:22:38,967 --> 01:22:42,095
Norman?
Sheriff Chambers.

722
01:22:42,170 --> 01:22:45,105
Ye... I been
just fine, thanks.

723
01:22:45,173 --> 01:22:47,767
Listen, we got
worries here.

724
01:22:47,843 --> 01:22:51,279
Yeah, have you had a fella
stop by there tonight...

725
01:22:52,514 --> 01:22:54,948
Well, this one
wouldn't be a customer.

726
01:22:55,017 --> 01:22:58,077
- A private detective, name of...
- Arbogast.

727
01:22:58,153 --> 01:23:00,087
Arbogast.

728
01:23:02,557 --> 01:23:04,491
And after he left?

729
01:23:07,195 --> 01:23:09,390
No, that's...
that's okay, Norman.

730
01:23:12,067 --> 01:23:15,002
This detective was there,
Norman told him about the girl,

731
01:23:15,070 --> 01:23:18,005
the detective thanked him
and he went away.

732
01:23:18,073 --> 01:23:21,406
And he didn't come back?
He didn't see the mother?

733
01:23:21,476 --> 01:23:24,411
Your detective told you
he couldn't come right back...

734
01:23:24,479 --> 01:23:27,937
because he was going to question
Norman Bates' mother, right?

735
01:23:28,016 --> 01:23:29,950
Yes.

736
01:23:30,018 --> 01:23:32,851
Norman Bates' mother
has been dead and buried...

737
01:23:32,921 --> 01:23:37,085
in Greenlawn Cemetery
for the past ten years.

738
01:23:37,159 --> 01:23:40,788
I helped Norman pick out the dress
she was buried in. Periwinkle blue.

739
01:23:40,862 --> 01:23:42,796
'Tain't only
local history, Sam.

740
01:23:42,864 --> 01:23:46,732
It's the only case of murder
and suicide on Fairvale ledgers.

741
01:23:46,802 --> 01:23:50,602
Mrs. Bates poisoned this guy
she was... involved with...

742
01:23:50,672 --> 01:23:53,140
when she found out
he was married,

743
01:23:53,208 --> 01:23:56,405
then took a helpin' of
the same stuff herself.

744
01:23:56,478 --> 01:24:00,107
Strychnine.
Ugly way to die.

745
01:24:00,182 --> 01:24:02,946
Norman found them
dead together.

746
01:24:03,018 --> 01:24:05,885
In bed.

747
01:24:05,954 --> 01:24:08,388
You mean that old woman I saw sittin'
in the window wasn't Bates' mother?

748
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:13,053
Now, wait a minute, Sam.
Are you sure you saw an old woman?

749
01:24:13,128 --> 01:24:15,494
Yes! In the house
behind the motel!

750
01:24:15,564 --> 01:24:17,794
I called and pounded
but she just ignored me!

751
01:24:17,866 --> 01:24:20,357
You saw
Norman Bates' mother?

752
01:24:20,435 --> 01:24:24,064
But it had to be...
because Arbogast said so too!

753
01:24:24,139 --> 01:24:27,836
And the young man wouldn't let him
see her because she was too ill.

754
01:24:27,909 --> 01:24:31,845
Well, if the woman up there
is Mrs. Bates,

755
01:24:31,913 --> 01:24:35,542
who's that woman buried
out in Greenlawn Cemetery?

756
01:25:18,160 --> 01:25:22,358
Now, Mother, um...
l-I'm gonna bring something up...

757
01:25:22,431 --> 01:25:25,025
I am sorry, boy,

758
01:25:25,100 --> 01:25:28,695
but you do manage to look ludicrous
when you give me orders.

759
01:25:28,770 --> 01:25:30,704
Please, Mother.

760
01:25:30,772 --> 01:25:33,935
No!
I will not hide in the fruit cellar.

761
01:25:34,009 --> 01:25:37,172
Ha! You think
I'm fruity, huh?

762
01:25:37,245 --> 01:25:39,304
I'm staying right here.

763
01:25:39,381 --> 01:25:42,282
This is my room and
no one will drag me out of it,

764
01:25:42,350 --> 01:25:44,875
least of all
my big, bold son.

765
01:25:44,953 --> 01:25:46,887
They'll come now, Mother.

766
01:25:46,955 --> 01:25:50,686
He came after the girl,
and now someone will come after him.

767
01:25:50,759 --> 01:25:54,923
Mother, please, it's just for
a few days so they won't find you.

768
01:25:54,996 --> 01:25:57,191
Just for a few days?

769
01:25:57,265 --> 01:26:01,065
In that dark, dank
fruit cellar? No!

770
01:26:01,136 --> 01:26:04,537
You hid me there once, boy, and you
won't do it again, not ever again!

771
01:26:04,606 --> 01:26:07,598
Now get out!

772
01:26:07,676 --> 01:26:11,442
- I told you to get out, boy.
- I'll carry you, Mother.

773
01:26:11,513 --> 01:26:14,539
Norman, what do you
think you're doing?

774
01:26:14,616 --> 01:26:18,245
Don't you touch me!
Don't! Norman!

775
01:26:23,358 --> 01:26:26,521
Put me down! Put me down!
I can walk on my own.

776
01:26:31,867 --> 01:26:33,801
Wonderful sermon today.

777
01:26:33,869 --> 01:26:36,337
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

778
01:26:36,404 --> 01:26:38,668
We thought we'd drive out
to that motel with you.

779
01:26:38,740 --> 01:26:41,106
- He's already been.
- Went out before service.

780
01:26:41,176 --> 01:26:43,736
- Did you two have breakfast?
- Didn't find anything?

781
01:26:43,812 --> 01:26:47,475
Nothing. Let's
clear the way here.

782
01:26:47,549 --> 01:26:49,847
What did he say
about my sister?

783
01:26:49,918 --> 01:26:53,183
Just what he told your detective:
She used a fake name.

784
01:26:53,255 --> 01:26:57,521
Saw the register myself. Saw the
whole place. That boy's alone there.

785
01:26:57,592 --> 01:27:00,527
- No mother?
- You must have seen an illusion, Sam.

786
01:27:00,595 --> 01:27:03,029
I know you're not
the seein'-illusions type,

787
01:27:03,098 --> 01:27:05,999
but no woman was there and I don't
believe in ghosts, so there it is.

788
01:27:06,067 --> 01:27:08,001
I still feel
there's something...

789
01:27:08,069 --> 01:27:11,630
Can see you do. I'm sorry I couldn't
make you feel better.

790
01:27:11,706 --> 01:27:16,143
Come to my office this afternoon and
report a missing person and a theft.

791
01:27:16,211 --> 01:27:19,078
The sooner you drop this
in the lap of the law,

792
01:27:19,147 --> 01:27:22,674
that's the sooner you stand a chance
of your sister bein' picked up.

793
01:27:22,751 --> 01:27:24,810
How 'bout that?

794
01:27:24,886 --> 01:27:27,980
- I don't know.
- It's Sunday.

795
01:27:28,056 --> 01:27:32,254
Come to the house and do your reporting
around dinnertime. It'll make it nicer.

796
01:27:32,327 --> 01:27:34,261
You too, Sam.

797
01:27:34,329 --> 01:27:37,264
Thank you.

798
01:27:37,332 --> 01:27:42,269
- Maybe I am the seeing-illusions type.
- No, you're not.

799
01:27:42,337 --> 01:27:45,534
- You want me to drop you at the hotel...
- Sam.

800
01:27:45,607 --> 01:27:50,237
I still won't feel satisfied
until I go out there.

801
01:27:50,312 --> 01:27:53,509
Neither will I.
Come on.

802
01:27:53,582 --> 01:27:57,643
We better decide what we're gonna say
or do when we walk in there.

803
01:27:57,719 --> 01:27:59,949
We're going to register
as man and wife.

804
01:28:00,021 --> 01:28:03,218
We're going to
get shown to a cabin,

805
01:28:03,291 --> 01:28:06,886
and then we're going to search every
inch of the place, inside and out.

806
01:28:30,218 --> 01:28:33,153
I wonder where Norman Bates
does his hermiting.

807
01:28:33,221 --> 01:28:35,155
Someone's at that window.
I just saw the curtain move.

808
01:28:35,223 --> 01:28:36,349
Come on.

809
01:28:39,661 --> 01:28:42,095
- Well?
- Just coming up to ring for you.

810
01:28:42,163 --> 01:28:44,097
Uh-huh.
Suppose you want a room.

811
01:28:44,165 --> 01:28:46,599
We were gonna try to make it
to San Francisco,

812
01:28:46,668 --> 01:28:49,102
but we don't like the look
of that sky.

813
01:28:49,170 --> 01:28:52,105
Looks like a bad day coming,
doesn't it?

814
01:28:58,947 --> 01:29:01,415
- I'll take you to cabin ten.
- Better sign in first, hadn't we?

815
01:29:01,483 --> 01:29:03,417
That's not necessary.

816
01:29:03,485 --> 01:29:07,182
My boss is paying for this trip
and, uh, well, it's 90%business.

817
01:29:07,255 --> 01:29:10,053
He wants practically
notarized receipts.

818
01:29:10,125 --> 01:29:13,060
I'd better sign in
and get a receipt.

819
01:29:30,912 --> 01:29:32,846
Thank you.

820
01:29:35,216 --> 01:29:37,150
- I'll get your bags.
- Haven't any.

821
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:43,783
- I'll show you the room, then.
- First time I've ever seen it happen.

822
01:29:43,858 --> 01:29:45,792
You check in any other place
in this country without bags...

823
01:29:45,860 --> 01:29:49,796
- and you have to pay in advance.
- Ten dollars.

824
01:29:56,371 --> 01:29:58,703
That receipt.

825
01:30:03,578 --> 01:30:06,206
I'll go on ahead.

826
01:30:10,885 --> 01:30:13,854
All right, there's your receipt.
I'll show you the cabin.

827
01:30:13,922 --> 01:30:16,789
Don't bother yourself.
We'll find it.

828
01:30:35,276 --> 01:30:37,608
Sam, we have to go into that cabin
and search it,

829
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:40,614
no matter what we're afraid of
finding or how much it may hurt.

830
01:30:40,682 --> 01:30:42,616
I know.

831
01:30:42,684 --> 01:30:44,618
Do you think if something
happened, it happened there?

832
01:30:44,686 --> 01:30:46,620
I don't know, but if you had...

833
01:30:46,688 --> 01:30:50,146
a useless business like this motel,
what would you need to get out?

834
01:30:50,225 --> 01:30:53,592
To get a new business somewhere else?
Forty thousand dollars?

835
01:30:56,397 --> 01:30:58,490
How could we prove that...

836
01:30:58,566 --> 01:31:01,364
If he opens a motel on
the new highway in, say, a year...

837
01:31:01,436 --> 01:31:03,700
There must be some proof
that exists now,

838
01:31:03,772 --> 01:31:06,969
something that proves he got
that money away from Marion somehow.

839
01:31:07,041 --> 01:31:12,035
- What makes you sound so certain?
- Arbogast. He liked me, Sam.

840
01:31:12,113 --> 01:31:14,047
Or he felt sorry for me
and he was beginning to feel...

841
01:31:14,115 --> 01:31:15,673
the same way about you.

842
01:31:15,750 --> 01:31:18,514
I could tell the last time
I talked to him on the phone.

843
01:31:18,586 --> 01:31:21,020
He wouldn't have gone anywhere or done
anything without telling us,

844
01:31:21,089 --> 01:31:22,522
unless he was stopped.

845
01:31:22,590 --> 01:31:26,424
And he was stopped. So he must
have found out something.

846
01:31:28,696 --> 01:31:31,392
We'll start with cabin one.

847
01:31:33,234 --> 01:31:36,362
If he sees us,
we're just taking the air.

848
01:32:08,336 --> 01:32:10,270
Bates.

849
01:32:58,953 --> 01:33:00,921
No shower curtain.

850
01:33:00,989 --> 01:33:03,514
- Sam! Look!
- Huh? What is it?

851
01:33:03,591 --> 01:33:05,752
It's figuring. It didn't
get washed down. Look.

852
01:33:05,827 --> 01:33:09,763
Some figure has been added to
or subtracted from 40,000.

853
01:33:09,831 --> 01:33:12,299
That proves Marion was here.
It'd be too wild a coincidence...

854
01:33:12,367 --> 01:33:14,301
Bates never denied she was here.

855
01:33:14,369 --> 01:33:17,532
Oh. Doesn't that prove
he found out about the money?

856
01:33:17,605 --> 01:33:20,233
Do we simply ask him
where he's hidden it?

857
01:33:20,308 --> 01:33:23,675
But that old woman, whoever she is,
she told Arbogast something.

858
01:33:23,745 --> 01:33:27,078
I want her to tell us
the same thing.

859
01:33:27,148 --> 01:33:29,378
- You can't go up there.
- Why not?

860
01:33:29,450 --> 01:33:31,384
- Bates.
- Well, let's find him.

861
01:33:31,452 --> 01:33:34,615
One of us can keep him occupied while
the other gets to the old woman.

862
01:33:34,689 --> 01:33:38,022
You'll never be able to hold him
still if he doesn't want to be held.

863
01:33:38,092 --> 01:33:40,993
I don't like you going
into that house alone.

864
01:33:41,062 --> 01:33:42,996
I can handle a sick old woman.

865
01:33:43,064 --> 01:33:45,999
All right, I'll find Bates
and keep him occupied.

866
01:33:47,035 --> 01:33:49,026
Wait a minute.

867
01:33:49,103 --> 01:33:52,368
If you get anything
out of the mother,

868
01:33:52,440 --> 01:33:54,635
can you find your way
back to town?

869
01:33:54,709 --> 01:33:57,041
Yes, of course.

870
01:33:57,111 --> 01:34:00,478
If you do get anything,
don't stop to tell me.

871
01:34:23,304 --> 01:34:25,898
- You looking for me?
- Why, yes, as a matter off act.

872
01:34:25,974 --> 01:34:28,135
Wife's taking a nap and...

873
01:34:28,209 --> 01:34:32,168
I never can keep quiet enough for her,
so I thought I'd look you up and talk.

874
01:34:32,246 --> 01:34:35,579
- Good. You satisfied with your cabin?
- Oh, it's fine.

875
01:35:48,689 --> 01:35:51,658
I've been doing all the talking
so far, haven't I?

876
01:35:51,726 --> 01:35:54,160
I thought it was the people
who were alone most of the time...

877
01:35:54,228 --> 01:35:56,594
who did all the talking
when they got the chance.

878
01:35:56,664 --> 01:35:58,825
Here you are
doing all the listening.

879
01:35:58,900 --> 01:36:01,368
- You are alone here, aren't you?
- Mm-hmm.

880
01:36:01,436 --> 01:36:04,030
Drive me crazy.

881
01:36:04,105 --> 01:36:07,040
I think that would be a rather
extreme reaction, don't you?

882
01:36:07,108 --> 01:36:12,239
Just an expression. What I meant was,
uh, I'd do anything to get away.

883
01:36:12,313 --> 01:36:14,281
- Wouldn't you?
- No.

884
01:36:18,319 --> 01:36:21,550
Mrs. Bates?

885
01:37:38,366 --> 01:37:40,926
I'm not saying you
shouldn't be contented here,

886
01:37:41,002 --> 01:37:42,936
I'm just doubting that you are.

887
01:37:43,004 --> 01:37:46,599
I think if you saw a chance to get out
from under you'd unload this place.

888
01:37:46,674 --> 01:37:50,610
This place? This place happens
to be my only world.

889
01:37:50,678 --> 01:37:53,613
I grew up in that house.
I had a very happy childhood.

890
01:37:53,681 --> 01:37:56,309
My mother and I
were more than happy.

891
01:38:58,112 --> 01:39:00,546
You look frightened. Have I been
saying something frightening?

892
01:39:00,615 --> 01:39:02,549
I don't know
what you've been saying.

893
01:39:02,617 --> 01:39:05,745
I've been talking about your mother,
about your motel.

894
01:39:05,820 --> 01:39:07,981
- How you gonna do it?
- Do what?

895
01:39:08,055 --> 01:39:10,819
Buy a new one in a new town where you
won't have to hide your mother.

896
01:39:10,891 --> 01:39:13,792
Why don't you just get in
your car and drive away?

897
01:39:13,861 --> 01:39:17,763
Where will you get the money to do that?
Or do you already have it socked away?

898
01:39:17,832 --> 01:39:21,097
- Shut up!
- A lot of it. Forty thousand dollars.

899
01:39:24,538 --> 01:39:27,996
I bet your mother knows where the money
is and what you did to get it.

900
01:39:28,075 --> 01:39:31,806
I think she'll tell us.

901
01:39:31,879 --> 01:39:35,508
Where's that girl you came here with?
Where is she?

902
01:40:40,348 --> 01:40:42,680
Mrs. Bates, it's...

903
01:41:02,103 --> 01:41:06,233
Norman Bates!

904
01:41:34,502 --> 01:41:38,199
If anyone gets any answers
it'll be the psychiatrist.

905
01:41:38,272 --> 01:41:40,968
Even I couldn't get to Norman
and he knows me.

906
01:41:41,041 --> 01:41:43,066
- You warm enough, miss?
- Yes.

907
01:41:44,311 --> 01:41:46,973
Did he talk to you?

908
01:41:47,047 --> 01:41:49,948
No.

909
01:41:50,017 --> 01:41:55,080
I got the whole story, but not from
Norman. I got it from his "mother."

910
01:41:56,323 --> 01:41:59,918
Norman Bates
no longer exists.

911
01:41:59,994 --> 01:42:02,724
He only half-existed
to begin with.

912
01:42:02,797 --> 01:42:06,893
And now the other half
has taken over,

913
01:42:06,967 --> 01:42:09,527
probably for all time.

914
01:42:11,272 --> 01:42:13,263
Did he kill my sister?

915
01:42:13,340 --> 01:42:16,832
Yes... and no.

916
01:42:16,911 --> 01:42:19,607
Now look, if you're trying to lay
some psychiatric groundwork...

917
01:42:19,680 --> 01:42:22,342
for some sort of plea
this fellow would like to cop...

918
01:42:22,416 --> 01:42:25,544
A psychiatrist
doesn't lay the groundwork.

919
01:42:25,619 --> 01:42:28,019
He merely tries
to explain it.

920
01:42:28,088 --> 01:42:31,114
- But my sister is...
- Yes.

921
01:42:33,427 --> 01:42:38,091
Yes, I'm sorry.
The private investigator too.

922
01:42:38,165 --> 01:42:41,965
If you drag that swamp somewhere in
the vicinity of the motel, you'Il...

923
01:42:45,973 --> 01:42:48,840
Uh, have you any unsolved
missing persons cases on your books?

924
01:42:48,909 --> 01:42:52,106
- Yes, two.
- Young girls?

925
01:42:52,179 --> 01:42:55,205
- Did he confess to...
- Like I said,

926
01:42:55,282 --> 01:42:57,216
the "mother."

927
01:42:59,053 --> 01:43:03,046
To understand it the way I understood
it, hearing it from the "mother"...

928
01:43:03,123 --> 01:43:06,684
that is from the "mother" half
of Norman's mind...

929
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,729
you have to go back
ten years...

930
01:43:09,797 --> 01:43:12,322
to the time when Norman murdered
his mother and her lover.

931
01:43:12,399 --> 01:43:17,496
He was already dangerously disturbed,
had been since his father died.

932
01:43:19,139 --> 01:43:23,735
His mother was
a clinging, demanding woman,

933
01:43:23,811 --> 01:43:27,747
and for years the two of them lived as
if there was no one else in the world.

934
01:43:29,283 --> 01:43:31,774
Then she met a man,

935
01:43:31,852 --> 01:43:36,289
and it seemed to Norman that
she threw him over for this man.

936
01:43:36,357 --> 01:43:39,793
That pushed him over the line
and he killed them both.

937
01:43:39,860 --> 01:43:44,024
Matricide is probably the most
unbearable crime of all,

938
01:43:45,833 --> 01:43:49,735
most unbearable
to the son who commits it.

939
01:43:49,803 --> 01:43:55,173
So he had to erase the crime,
at least in his own mind.

940
01:43:57,578 --> 01:44:00,046
He stole her corpse.

941
01:44:01,916 --> 01:44:05,010
A weighted coffin was buried.

942
01:44:05,085 --> 01:44:07,986
He hid the body
in the fruit cellar,

943
01:44:08,055 --> 01:44:11,149
even treated it to keep it
as well as it would keep.

944
01:44:11,225 --> 01:44:14,023
And that still
wasn't enough.

945
01:44:14,094 --> 01:44:17,825
She was there...
but she was a corpse.

946
01:44:20,334 --> 01:44:23,098
So he began to think
and speak for her,

947
01:44:23,170 --> 01:44:26,230
give her half his life,
so to speak.

948
01:44:26,307 --> 01:44:30,937
At times he could be both personalities,
carry on conversations.

949
01:44:31,011 --> 01:44:35,345
At other times, the "mother" half
took over completely.

950
01:44:35,416 --> 01:44:40,012
He was never all Norman,
but he was of ten only "Mother,"

951
01:44:41,722 --> 01:44:45,317
and because he was so
pathologically jealous of her,

952
01:44:45,392 --> 01:44:48,054
he assumed that she
was as jealous of him.

953
01:44:48,128 --> 01:44:53,430
Therefore, if he felt a strong
attraction to any other woman,

954
01:44:53,500 --> 01:44:57,231
the "mother" side of him
would go wild.

955
01:44:59,540 --> 01:45:02,509
When he met your sister,

956
01:45:02,576 --> 01:45:05,204
he was touched by her,
aroused by her.

957
01:45:05,279 --> 01:45:08,043
He wanted her.

958
01:45:08,115 --> 01:45:11,983
That set off the jealous "mother"
and "Mother" killed the girl.

959
01:45:14,655 --> 01:45:18,955
After the murder Norman returned
as if from a deep sleep...

960
01:45:19,026 --> 01:45:22,757
and, like a dutiful son, covered up
all traces of the crime...

961
01:45:22,830 --> 01:45:25,230
he was convinced
his "mother" had committed!

962
01:45:25,299 --> 01:45:27,767
Why was he...
dressed like that?

963
01:45:27,835 --> 01:45:30,702
He's a transvestite.

964
01:45:30,771 --> 01:45:33,467
Uh, not exactly.

965
01:45:33,540 --> 01:45:37,101
A man who dresses in women's clothing
in order to achieve a sexual change,

966
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:39,372
or satisfaction,
is a transvestite.

967
01:45:39,446 --> 01:45:43,746
But in Norman's case, he was simply
doing everything possible...

968
01:45:43,817 --> 01:45:47,014
to keep alive the illusion
of his mother being alive.

969
01:45:48,422 --> 01:45:51,482
And when reality
came too close,

970
01:45:51,558 --> 01:45:55,153
when danger or desire
threatened that illusion,

971
01:45:57,531 --> 01:46:00,591
he dressed up, even to
a cheap wig he bought.

972
01:46:00,668 --> 01:46:04,627
He'd walk about the house,
sit in her chair, speak in her voice.

973
01:46:04,705 --> 01:46:06,935
He tried to be
his mother.

974
01:46:08,475 --> 01:46:11,638
And, uh, now he is.

975
01:46:11,712 --> 01:46:16,706
That's what I meant when I said
I got the story from the "mother."

976
01:46:16,784 --> 01:46:20,720
You see, when the mind
houses two personalities...

977
01:46:20,788 --> 01:46:24,315
there's always
a conflict, a battle.

978
01:46:24,391 --> 01:46:28,054
In Norman's case,
the battle is over...

979
01:46:28,128 --> 01:46:30,255
and the dominant personality
has won.

980
01:46:30,330 --> 01:46:34,460
And the $40,000?
Who got that?

981
01:46:34,535 --> 01:46:38,301
The swamp. These were
crimes of passion, not profit.

982
01:46:40,074 --> 01:46:42,736
He feels a little chill.
Can I bring him this blanket?

983
01:46:44,078 --> 01:46:46,046
- Oh, sure.
- All right.

984
01:46:58,625 --> 01:47:01,059
Thank you.

985
01:47:07,668 --> 01:47:10,660
It's sad when a mother
has to speak the words...

986
01:47:10,738 --> 01:47:13,002
that condemn her own son,

987
01:47:13,073 --> 01:47:16,873
but I couldn't allow them
to believe that I would commit murder.

988
01:47:16,944 --> 01:47:21,347
They'll put him away now,
as I should have years ago.

989
01:47:21,415 --> 01:47:24,282
He was always bad,
and in the end...

990
01:47:24,351 --> 01:47:28,811
he intended to tell them I killed
those girls and that man,

991
01:47:28,889 --> 01:47:32,586
as if I could do anything
except sit and stare,

992
01:47:32,659 --> 01:47:35,651
like one of his stuffed birds.

993
01:47:35,729 --> 01:47:39,290
They know I can't even
move a finger, and I won't.

994
01:47:39,366 --> 01:47:44,963
I'll just sit here and be quiet,
just in case they do suspect me.

995
01:47:48,008 --> 01:47:51,774
They're probably watching me.
Well, let them.

996
01:47:51,845 --> 01:47:55,645
Let them see
what kind of a person I am.

997
01:47:55,716 --> 01:47:58,014
I'm not even
gonna swat that fly.

998
01:47:58,085 --> 01:48:01,521
I hope they are watching.
They'll see.

999
01:48:01,588 --> 01:48:03,522
They'll see
and they'll know,

1000
01:48:03,590 --> 01:48:09,290
and they'll say, "Why, she
wouldn't even harm a fly."
