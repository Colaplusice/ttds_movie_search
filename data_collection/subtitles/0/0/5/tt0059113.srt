1
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
What are they like, these girls?

2
00:07:39,001 --> 00:07:40,001
They're very good.

3
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:41,001
Bit wild.

4
00:07:41,001 --> 00:07:43,002
Spend their money quickly, work hard.

5
00:07:43,002 --> 00:07:46,003
-Are they literate?
-Some of them.

6
00:07:46,003 --> 00:07:51,005
In reformatories since being picked up.
Jobs like this. It's degrading.

7
00:07:51,005 --> 00:07:53,006
You shouldn't use
human beings to move earth.

8
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,007
-No.
-And it's not efficient.

9
00:07:57,007 --> 00:07:59,008
If they'd give me more excavators
I'd be a year ahead.

10
00:08:00,008 --> 00:08:01,009
You're an impatient generation.

11
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:04,010
-Weren't you?
-Yes, we were.

12
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,010
Very.

13
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:09,012
Don't be too impatient, comrade.
We've come very far, very fast.

14
00:08:10,012 --> 00:08:11,012
I know, comrade.

15
00:08:11,012 --> 00:08:14,013
Yes, but do you know what it cost?

16
00:08:15,014 --> 00:08:17,014
There were children then
who lived off human flesh.

17
00:08:17,014 --> 00:08:18,015
Did you know that?

18
00:08:27,018 --> 00:08:30,019
What is your interest
in this girl, Comrade General?

19
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,020
She may be my brother's child.

20
00:08:33,020 --> 00:08:35,021
-Yuri Andreyevich?
-Yes.

21
00:08:35,021 --> 00:08:38,022
My half brother, I should say.

22
00:08:39,022 --> 00:08:43,024
If she is, she's also Lara's child.

23
00:08:45,025 --> 00:08:46,025
The Lara?

24
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,026
The Lara, yes.

25
00:08:50,026 --> 00:08:52,027
This is. . .

26
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:55,028
. . .a new edition
of the Lara poems.

27
00:08:55,028 --> 00:08:56,029
Yes, I know.

28
00:08:57,029 --> 00:09:01,030
-We admire your brother very much.
-Yes. Everybody seems to, now.

29
00:09:02,031 --> 00:09:05,032
We couldn't admire him when
we weren't allowed to read him.

30
00:09:06,032 --> 00:09:07,032
No.

31
00:09:22,038 --> 00:09:24,039
Come in.

32
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:31,041
I sent for you, comrade.

33
00:09:31,041 --> 00:09:33,042
You're not in any trouble.

34
00:09:44,046 --> 00:09:48,047
I'm General Yevgraf
Andreyevich Zhivago.

35
00:09:49,048 --> 00:09:50,048
I'm looking for someone.

36
00:09:52,049 --> 00:09:53,049
Do you understand?

37
00:09:57,051 --> 00:10:00,052
The person I'm looking for
would be my niece.

38
00:10:04,053 --> 00:10:05,053
Please sit down.

39
00:10:08,055 --> 00:10:09,055
Your name is--?

40
00:10:09,055 --> 00:10:12,056
Tonya Komarov, Comrade General.

41
00:10:12,056 --> 00:10:14,057
They found you in Mongolia?

42
00:10:15,057 --> 00:10:18,058
-Yes, Comrade General.
-What were you doing there?

43
00:10:18,058 --> 00:10:21,059
-I was lost, Comrade General.
-How did you come to be lost?

44
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,061
-I've forgotten.
-Was Komarovsky your father's name?

45
00:10:25,061 --> 00:10:27,061
I suppose so, Comrade General.

46
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:29,062
You suppose so?

47
00:10:29,062 --> 00:10:30,062
It's a common name.

48
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,064
Do you remember your father?

49
00:10:33,064 --> 00:10:34,064
No.

50
00:10:35,064 --> 00:10:37,065
Do you remember your mother?

51
00:10:37,065 --> 00:10:40,066
Yes, I remember my mother.

52
00:10:40,066 --> 00:10:43,067
-What was her name?
-Mummy.

53
00:10:44,068 --> 00:10:45,068
What was she like?

54
00:10:45,068 --> 00:10:47,069
I mean, what did she look like?

55
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,070
Big.

56
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:52,070
Big?

57
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:56,072
I was little. She looked big.

58
00:11:03,074 --> 00:11:05,075
-Can you read?
-Yes.

59
00:11:06,075 --> 00:11:10,077
"Lara: A Cycle of Poems
by Y.A. Zhivago. "

60
00:11:10,077 --> 00:11:13,078
Not me. My half brother.

61
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,079
The person I'm looking for. . .

62
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:20,081
. . .would be this man's daughter.

63
00:11:24,082 --> 00:11:25,082
This would be her mother.

64
00:11:29,084 --> 00:11:30,084
"Lara. "

65
00:11:32,085 --> 00:11:35,086
Did anybody ever
call your mother Lara?

66
00:11:36,086 --> 00:11:37,087
I don't know.

67
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:39,087
I don't think so.

68
00:11:42,088 --> 00:11:44,089
She's nice.

69
00:11:46,090 --> 00:11:48,091
I'm not your niece, Comrade General.

70
00:11:48,091 --> 00:11:50,091
I'm nobody's idea of an uncle.

71
00:11:50,091 --> 00:11:53,092
But if this man were my father,
I should want to know.

72
00:11:54,093 --> 00:11:57,094
Did your mother tell you
your father was a poet?

73
00:11:57,094 --> 00:11:59,095
My father wasn't a poet.

74
00:11:59,095 --> 00:12:01,095
What was your father?

75
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,096
Not a poet.

76
00:12:07,097 --> 00:12:08,098
Did you like your father?

77
00:12:09,098 --> 00:12:10,099
I've forgotten.

78
00:12:10,099 --> 00:12:12,099
But you liked your mother.

79
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
Yes, of course.

80
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:21,103
Does the name Strelnikov mean
anything to you? Strelnikov?

81
00:12:24,104 --> 00:12:25,104
Varykino?

82
00:12:26,104 --> 00:12:28,105
That's a place, not a person.

83
00:12:29,105 --> 00:12:31,106
-Gromeko?
-Gromeko.

84
00:12:31,106 --> 00:12:33,107
Yes.

85
00:12:35,108 --> 00:12:36,108
You see. . .

86
00:12:37,108 --> 00:12:39,109
. . .he lost his mother. . .

87
00:12:39,109 --> 00:12:41,110
. . .at about the same age you were. . .

88
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,110
. . .when your mother. . .

89
00:12:44,111 --> 00:12:46,112
. . .Iost you.

90
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:50,113
And in the same part of the world.

91
00:14:15,144 --> 00:14:18,145
"Now is life's artful triumph
of vanities destroyed. . .

92
00:14:18,145 --> 00:14:21,146
. . .for the spirit has vanished
from its tabernacle.

93
00:14:22,146 --> 00:14:23,147
Its clay groweth black.

94
00:14:23,147 --> 00:14:26,148
The vessel is shattered,
voiceless, emotionless. . .

95
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:30,149
. . .dead. Committing
which unto the grave. . . . "

96
00:15:42,175 --> 00:15:43,175
Yuri!

97
00:16:13,186 --> 00:16:15,187
You and your husband will dine
with us, Madame Gromeko.

98
00:16:16,187 --> 00:16:17,188
Thank you, Father.

99
00:16:19,188 --> 00:16:22,190
Will you lie down then, Yuri?

100
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:26,191
Your mummy and I were great friends.

101
00:16:26,191 --> 00:16:30,192
So now we are going to look after you.

102
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,193
Thank you.

103
00:16:36,195 --> 00:16:37,195
That's Mother's!

104
00:16:37,195 --> 00:16:38,195
It's yours now.

105
00:16:39,196 --> 00:16:41,196
Yes, Yuri, Mummy left it to you.

106
00:16:41,196 --> 00:16:42,197
In her will.

107
00:16:42,197 --> 00:16:45,198
Do you know what a will is, old chap?

108
00:16:45,198 --> 00:16:47,199
Money.

109
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:49,199
No, Yuri, just this.

110
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,200
Your daddy has all--

111
00:16:51,200 --> 00:16:53,201
Can you play it?

112
00:16:54,201 --> 00:16:56,202
Thought all people here
could play the balalaika.

113
00:16:56,202 --> 00:16:58,203
You don't live here, do you?

114
00:16:59,203 --> 00:17:00,203
No, we live in Moscow.

115
00:17:00,203 --> 00:17:03,204
That's a long way from here.
But you'll like Moscow.

116
00:17:04,205 --> 00:17:05,205
-Won't he?
-In a bit.

117
00:17:05,205 --> 00:17:08,206
Takes time to get used
to things, doesn't it?

118
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:10,207
Mother could play it.

119
00:17:11,207 --> 00:17:14,208
Well, your mother was an artist, Yuri.

120
00:17:14,208 --> 00:17:18,210
She could make this common little
instrument sound like two guitars.

121
00:17:18,210 --> 00:17:20,210
Your mother had a gift.

122
00:17:20,210 --> 00:17:22,211
Perhaps Yuri's got a gift.

123
00:17:22,211 --> 00:17:23,212
Would you like lessons?

124
00:17:23,212 --> 00:17:25,212
I can't play it.

125
00:17:30,214 --> 00:17:32,215
Say good night to Yuri, Tonya.

126
00:17:35,216 --> 00:17:37,217
He's your brother now.

127
00:17:41,218 --> 00:17:43,219
Good night, Yuri.

128
00:17:43,219 --> 00:17:46,220
-Good night, old chap.
-Good night.

129
00:18:56,245 --> 00:18:59,246
The Gromekos didn 't know
what to make of him.

130
00:19:00,247 --> 00:19:04,248
He made his reputation as a poet
while he studied to be a doctor.

131
00:19:04,248 --> 00:19:07,249
He said poetry was no more
a vocation than good health.

132
00:19:07,249 --> 00:19:09,250
What he needed was a job.

133
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,250
Pretty?

134
00:19:11,251 --> 00:19:12,251
Very.

135
00:19:18,253 --> 00:19:19,253
It's their right to be pretty.

136
00:19:21,254 --> 00:19:25,256
-What do you do next year, Zhivago?
-I thought of general practice.

137
00:19:25,256 --> 00:19:27,256
Think about doing pure research.

138
00:19:27,256 --> 00:19:30,257
It's exciting, important.
Can be beautiful.

139
00:19:30,257 --> 00:19:31,258
General practice.

140
00:19:31,258 --> 00:19:33,259
Life. He wants to see life.

141
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:38,260
Well, you'll find that pretty
creatures do ugly things to people.

142
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,294
What's your name?

143
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:16,296
-Antipov.
-Address?

144
00:21:16,296 --> 00:21:17,296
1 5 Petrovka.

145
00:21:17,296 --> 00:21:20,297
-I'll have these.
-We have permission from the police.

146
00:21:20,297 --> 00:21:23,298
Well, you claim them
at the station.

147
00:21:23,298 --> 00:21:26,299
-When?
-Now, if you like.

148
00:21:26,299 --> 00:21:30,301
-Very well.
-Pasha! He's my brother.

149
00:21:31,301 --> 00:21:32,301
Well, take him home, miss.

150
00:21:32,301 --> 00:21:35,303
Before he gets into trouble.

151
00:21:40,304 --> 00:21:41,305
Pasha, please.

152
00:21:42,305 --> 00:21:43,305
It's got to be done.

153
00:21:44,306 --> 00:21:45,306
Why has it got to be done?

154
00:21:45,306 --> 00:21:48,307
For them. For the Revolution.

155
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:50,308
They don't want a revolution.

156
00:21:50,308 --> 00:21:53,309
They do. They don't know it,
but that's what they want.

157
00:21:53,309 --> 00:21:54,309
Give me some of those, comrade.

158
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,311
Pasha?

159
00:21:58,311 --> 00:21:59,311
Are you a Bolshevik?

160
00:21:59,311 --> 00:22:03,313
No, the Bolsheviks don't like me,
and I don't like them.

161
00:22:03,313 --> 00:22:05,313
They don't know right from wrong.

162
00:22:05,313 --> 00:22:08,314
Pasha Antipov, you're an awful prig.

163
00:22:14,317 --> 00:22:16,317
Why did you tell him
I was your brother?

164
00:22:16,317 --> 00:22:18,318
What else could I have told him?

165
00:22:19,318 --> 00:22:21,319
You could've told him
I was your fianc.

166
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:24,320
Pasha, don't be silly. I'm--

167
00:22:29,322 --> 00:22:32,323
Monsieur Komarovsky has come
to see my mother on business.

168
00:22:33,324 --> 00:22:35,324
People gossip round here.

169
00:22:35,324 --> 00:22:36,325
It's the system, Lara.

170
00:22:36,325 --> 00:22:39,326
People will be different
after the Revolution.

171
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:42,327
Will you come?

172
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:44,327
No, Pasha.

173
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:49,329
I've got exams to take, Pasha.
I've got to get my scholarship.

174
00:23:13,338 --> 00:23:15,339
Hello, Auntie.

175
00:23:15,339 --> 00:23:17,339
-There's a letter for you.
-Oh!

176
00:23:17,339 --> 00:23:19,340
-From Paris.
-Oh. . . .

177
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:23,342
-Lovely writing.
-She's coming home next month.

178
00:23:24,342 --> 00:23:27,343
Tonya? Oh, that's good.

179
00:23:35,346 --> 00:23:37,347
He does seem
to be very well-informed.

180
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:40,348
And such a handsome figure of a--

181
00:23:40,348 --> 00:23:42,348
Good evening, maman.

182
00:23:42,348 --> 00:23:44,349
-Madame.
-Larissa.

183
00:23:44,349 --> 00:23:47,350
You can work in there, dear.
Monsieur Komarovsky's here.

184
00:24:06,357 --> 00:24:08,358
Good evening, Larissa.

185
00:24:09,358 --> 00:24:10,359
Good evening, monsieur.

186
00:24:16,361 --> 00:24:18,361
He advises some very important people.

187
00:24:18,361 --> 00:24:19,362
Yes, I know.

188
00:24:19,362 --> 00:24:21,363
He has government connections.

189
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:23,363
I don't know, I'm sure.

190
00:24:23,363 --> 00:24:26,364
Isn't he very expensive?

191
00:24:26,364 --> 00:24:29,365
Monsieur Komarovsky advises me
out of kindness, baroness.

192
00:24:30,366 --> 00:24:31,366
He was a friend of my late husband's.

193
00:24:32,366 --> 00:24:34,367
-Oh, I see.
-Allow me.

194
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,378
Tuesday, if I can, my dear. Bye.

195
00:25:22,385 --> 00:25:23,385
Where did you get this?

196
00:25:24,385 --> 00:25:25,386
Friend gave it to me, monsieur.

197
00:25:26,386 --> 00:25:28,387
You're not to go to this
"peaceful" demonstration.

198
00:25:29,387 --> 00:25:30,387
May not be as peaceful as they think.

199
00:25:31,388 --> 00:25:34,389
That's all I'll say.
Tell your friend she's silly.

200
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:37,390
Yes, monsieur.

201
00:25:47,394 --> 00:25:49,394
How old are you now?

202
00:25:50,395 --> 00:25:51,395
Seventeen, monsieur.

203
00:27:04,421 --> 00:27:05,422
Hundred and three.

204
00:27:05,422 --> 00:27:09,423
Oh, dear. And I was
so looking forward to it.

205
00:27:09,423 --> 00:27:12,424
Oh, never mind.
I'll be all right here.

206
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:15,425
You will take Lara,
won't you, Victor lppolitovich?

207
00:27:15,425 --> 00:27:18,426
So stupid of me.
It's her first long gown--

208
00:27:21,427 --> 00:27:25,429
-I think you'd better call it off.
-I'll stay with you.

209
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:28,430
Nonsense, I'll be perfectly
all right. I've got a book.

210
00:27:28,430 --> 00:27:30,431
So disappointing for her,
Victor lppolitovich.

211
00:27:31,431 --> 00:27:34,432
There's so little opportunity
to mix with good society.

212
00:27:36,433 --> 00:27:38,434
Very well, get your coat.

213
00:27:39,434 --> 00:27:42,435
We're late, if we're going.
I want to avoid Kropotkin Street.

214
00:28:19,448 --> 00:28:23,450
"Brotherhood and freedom. "
Yuri, what splendid words.

215
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,451
"Justice, equality and bread. "

216
00:28:27,451 --> 00:28:29,452
Don't you think they're splendid?

217
00:28:29,452 --> 00:28:30,452
Yes, I do.

218
00:28:31,453 --> 00:28:32,453
"Brotherhood and freedom. "

219
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:36,455
Brotherhood and fiddlesticks,
you're frozen through.

220
00:28:36,455 --> 00:28:40,456
You've no right, Anushka.
It isn't fair.

221
00:28:43,457 --> 00:28:47,459
Ah! We'd given you up, monsieur.

222
00:28:47,459 --> 00:28:49,459
My niece. Coat, Lara?

223
00:28:55,461 --> 00:28:57,462
Come, my dear.

224
00:29:23,472 --> 00:29:24,472
How's the foie de veau Gascogne?

225
00:29:25,472 --> 00:29:26,473
As always, monsieur.

226
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:30,474
-All right, not too much--
-Not too much mustard, monsieur.

227
00:29:35,476 --> 00:29:39,477
-Wine, monsieur?
-A little light wine, yes.

228
00:29:42,478 --> 00:29:44,479
This place must be very
expensive, Monsieur Komarovsky.

229
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:50,481
It is.
Why not "Victor lppolitovich"?

230
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:54,483
I can't.

231
00:30:20,492 --> 00:30:22,493
Mother made this dress.

232
00:30:22,493 --> 00:30:24,494
Very nice.

233
00:30:24,494 --> 00:30:26,494
She's clever, isn't she?

234
00:30:26,494 --> 00:30:29,495
Your mother? Yes.
Fine little woman.

235
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:13,511
No doubt they'll sing in tune
after the Revolution.

236
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,534
Prepare!

237
00:32:36,541 --> 00:32:38,542
Mount!

238
00:33:48,567 --> 00:33:50,568
Tote sabers.

239
00:35:12,598 --> 00:35:13,598
What, what--?

240
00:35:13,598 --> 00:35:14,598
What?

241
00:35:46,610 --> 00:35:47,610
Good night, dear.

242
00:35:47,610 --> 00:35:50,611
Good night, Victor lppolitovich.

243
00:36:04,616 --> 00:36:06,617
Go inside your houses, please.

244
00:36:06,617 --> 00:36:10,619
All these people will be taken
care of. Go inside, please.

245
00:36:11,619 --> 00:36:15,620
All these people will be taken
care of. Go inside, please.

246
00:36:21,622 --> 00:36:22,623
Get inside.

247
00:36:26,624 --> 00:36:28,625
Yuri, please. No trouble.

248
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:31,626
Take him inside,
or I'll put him under arrest.

249
00:36:31,626 --> 00:36:35,628
Yuri, I beg you.
Tonya's coming home tomorrow.

250
00:37:22,644 --> 00:37:24,645
Yuri!

251
00:37:25,646 --> 00:37:26,646
Tonya!

252
00:37:47,654 --> 00:37:48,654
Yuri?

253
00:37:53,656 --> 00:37:54,656
Well!

254
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,659
Daddy!

255
00:38:07,661 --> 00:38:10,662
There, now. That's enough.

256
00:38:10,662 --> 00:38:12,663
Your mother, your mother.

257
00:38:15,664 --> 00:38:16,664
Mummy!

258
00:38:24,667 --> 00:38:25,667
Mummy, how are you?

259
00:38:26,668 --> 00:38:29,669
Me? Fit as a fiddle.

260
00:38:29,669 --> 00:38:31,669
Turn round.

261
00:38:34,670 --> 00:38:37,672
Well, they've taught her something.

262
00:38:44,674 --> 00:38:48,676
-Look at that.
-Isn't Yuri looking well, Tonya?

263
00:38:48,676 --> 00:38:50,676
Well, let's get along, dear.

264
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:52,677
Yes, run along, you two.

265
00:38:56,678 --> 00:38:58,679
Oh, I bought you this.

266
00:38:58,679 --> 00:39:00,680
It has a piece
about young Russian poets.

267
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:03,681
Oh, good, thank you.
Does it mention me?

268
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:06,682
It begins with you. You're the best.

269
00:39:07,682 --> 00:39:09,683
Very intelligent nation, the French.

270
00:39:09,683 --> 00:39:11,684
They have their heads together.

271
00:39:11,684 --> 00:39:14,685
Yes, they're looking at the paper.

272
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:15,685
They're head over heels.

273
00:39:16,686 --> 00:39:18,686
Anushka, stop it!

274
00:39:18,686 --> 00:39:22,688
Good marriages are made in heaven.
Or some such place.

275
00:39:30,691 --> 00:39:33,692
-Victor lppolitovich?
-Pasha.

276
00:39:36,693 --> 00:39:38,694
I want to talk to you.

277
00:39:39,694 --> 00:39:40,694
No, Pasha.

278
00:39:41,695 --> 00:39:42,695
It's important.

279
00:39:44,696 --> 00:39:45,696
All right.

280
00:39:52,699 --> 00:39:53,699
Pasha!

281
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:56,700
How did you do it?

282
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,701
I didn't.

283
00:39:59,701 --> 00:40:00,702
A dragoon did.

284
00:40:02,702 --> 00:40:04,703
Oh, Pasha, darling!

285
00:40:04,703 --> 00:40:06,704
Come, come.

286
00:40:09,705 --> 00:40:10,705
Where's your mother?

287
00:40:10,705 --> 00:40:11,706
Asleep.

288
00:40:13,706 --> 00:40:14,707
Pasha.

289
00:40:28,712 --> 00:40:30,712
Pasha, I can't deal with this.

290
00:40:30,712 --> 00:40:32,713
Have you got any iodine?

291
00:40:32,713 --> 00:40:33,713
-Yes, but--
-Get it.

292
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:52,720
Pasha, darling!

293
00:40:54,721 --> 00:40:57,722
Pasha, you must go to a hospital.

294
00:40:58,722 --> 00:41:00,723
I daren't for a day or two.

295
00:41:01,724 --> 00:41:04,725
-Will you do something for me?
-Oh, yes. What?

296
00:41:06,725 --> 00:41:07,726
Hide this.

297
00:41:12,728 --> 00:41:14,728
Oh, throw it away!

298
00:41:14,728 --> 00:41:18,730
No. There'll be no more
peaceful demonstrations.

299
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:22,731
There were women and children.
They rode them down.

300
00:41:22,731 --> 00:41:24,732
Starving women, asking for bread.

301
00:41:25,732 --> 00:41:29,734
Up on Tamskaya Avenue, the pigs
were eating, drinking and dancing.

302
00:41:29,734 --> 00:41:31,734
Hide it for me.

303
00:41:34,735 --> 00:41:36,736
Thanks, comrade.

304
00:41:36,736 --> 00:41:39,737
Oh, Pasha, darling,
I'm not your comrade.

305
00:41:44,739 --> 00:41:46,740
-Yes?
-Who's there?

306
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:48,741
-It's only Pasha.
-Oh.

307
00:41:49,741 --> 00:41:54,743
-You came in very late last night.
-The time went so quickly.

308
00:41:54,743 --> 00:41:55,743
Good.

309
00:41:57,744 --> 00:41:59,745
-Are you going to church?
-Yes.

310
00:42:11,749 --> 00:42:14,750
You know what our Lord said
to the woman taken in adultery?

311
00:42:14,750 --> 00:42:18,751
Yes, Father.
He said, "Go and sin no more. "

312
00:42:18,751 --> 00:42:19,752
And did she?

313
00:42:20,752 --> 00:42:23,753
-I don't know, Father.
-Nobody does, child.

314
00:42:24,754 --> 00:42:27,755
The flesh is not weak. It is strong.

315
00:42:27,755 --> 00:42:31,756
Remember, only the sacrament
of marriage will contain it.

316
00:42:58,766 --> 00:43:02,767
Monsieur, it's number six
this evening, sir.

317
00:43:03,768 --> 00:43:05,768
The most important person here.

318
00:43:15,772 --> 00:43:20,774
-Sorry I'm late.
-I've been waiting nearly an hour.

319
00:43:20,774 --> 00:43:23,775
-Have you ordered?
-No.

320
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:26,776
Well, you should have done.

321
00:43:47,784 --> 00:43:48,784
You chose it, Victor.

322
00:43:52,785 --> 00:43:56,787
-You've grown up a lot, haven't you?
-Yes.

323
00:43:56,787 --> 00:44:00,788
-What did you tell your mama tonight?
-Victor, don't.

324
00:44:01,789 --> 00:44:04,790
-May I smoke?
-Yes, of course.

325
00:44:08,791 --> 00:44:12,793
You like it, don't you? Cigar smoke.

326
00:44:13,793 --> 00:44:15,794
Come along, my dear.

327
00:44:23,797 --> 00:44:25,797
Drink, drink, drink.

328
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:26,798
Up, up.

329
00:44:44,804 --> 00:44:48,806
Where did you tell her
we were going, your mama?

330
00:44:48,806 --> 00:44:50,806
She didn't ask.

331
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:52,807
-That's because she knows.
-No.

332
00:44:52,807 --> 00:44:56,808
You'd both take an oath she doesn't,
but she does. You know it.

333
00:44:56,808 --> 00:44:59,810
-Victor, don't.
-What?

334
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,810
-Torment me.
-Torment?

335
00:45:02,811 --> 00:45:03,811
What a little hypocrite it is.

336
00:45:06,812 --> 00:45:08,813
I'm going now, Victor.

337
00:45:09,813 --> 00:45:10,813
If you like, dear.

338
00:45:13,815 --> 00:45:16,816
You see, you'll always come back.

339
00:45:23,818 --> 00:45:25,819
Stay, darling.

340
00:45:28,820 --> 00:45:29,820
Stay.

341
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:28,842
Wake up! Take this and show it
to someone if you lose your way.

342
00:46:29,842 --> 00:46:32,843
Professor Boris Kurt.
You find him! Now, go on.

343
00:46:32,843 --> 00:46:34,844
Professor Boris Kurt!

344
00:46:49,849 --> 00:46:52,850
But, Boris, this is genius.

345
00:46:52,850 --> 00:46:56,852
Oh? I thought it was Rachmaninoff.
I'm going for a smoke.

346
00:47:05,855 --> 00:47:07,856
How's the general practitioner?

347
00:47:07,856 --> 00:47:11,857
-A bit scared of his finals.
-I don't think he need be.

348
00:47:11,857 --> 00:47:15,859
How do you like the idea of marrying
a general practitioner?

349
00:47:15,859 --> 00:47:18,860
Very much. But no GP has asked me.

350
00:47:18,860 --> 00:47:21,861
No? I thought you nomads
were hot-blooded?

351
00:47:22,861 --> 00:47:26,863
A slow lot, these GPs. How do you
fancy a professor of pathology?

352
00:47:27,863 --> 00:47:30,864
-Does he write poetry?
-Alas, no.

353
00:47:30,864 --> 00:47:34,865
Then I'm afraid it's out
of the question. Excuse me.

354
00:47:43,869 --> 00:47:48,871
-That's a marvelous girl, Zhivago.
-Yes, I'd noticed.

355
00:47:49,871 --> 00:47:51,872
It's for you.

356
00:48:08,878 --> 00:48:11,879
How'd the poet like to see
a bit of general practice?

357
00:48:15,880 --> 00:48:18,881
Thank God you've come.
This is very good of you.

358
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:21,882
-I know. My assistant.
-How do you do?

359
00:48:21,882 --> 00:48:24,884
-Come on, where is she?
-This way.

360
00:48:38,889 --> 00:48:41,890
-When did she do it?
-About 8:00 this evening.

361
00:48:46,891 --> 00:48:47,892
You know what it was?

362
00:48:53,894 --> 00:48:55,895
-Why not get a local doctor?
-I couldn't.

363
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:58,896
No, I suppose you couldn't.
Come on, then.

364
00:48:59,896 --> 00:49:01,897
Let's turn her over.

365
00:49:06,899 --> 00:49:07,899
Right.

366
00:49:10,900 --> 00:49:11,900
Water.

367
00:49:25,906 --> 00:49:28,907
Right, Yuri. Come on,
my dear, pick up.

368
00:49:29,907 --> 00:49:31,908
Now, Yuri.

369
00:49:32,908 --> 00:49:34,909
Come on, dear.

370
00:49:34,909 --> 00:49:37,910
-Oh, come on, Yuri.
-Sorry.

371
00:49:38,910 --> 00:49:41,911
Well, my dear. That's it.

372
00:49:41,911 --> 00:49:44,912
That's it. Good. Good.

373
00:49:45,913 --> 00:49:47,913
Good.

374
00:49:54,916 --> 00:49:55,916
Is she gonna live?

375
00:49:57,917 --> 00:49:58,917
Water.

376
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:06,920
-She is, isn't she?
-Yes.

377
00:50:07,921 --> 00:50:11,922
Funny thing. There's a man,
speaks on public platforms.

378
00:50:12,923 --> 00:50:16,924
In with the government, in with
the Liberals, in with everybody.

379
00:50:16,924 --> 00:50:19,925
And he risks it all. For that!

380
00:50:20,925 --> 00:50:24,927
That's not how poets see them, is it?
That's how GPs see them.

381
00:50:24,927 --> 00:50:29,929
-That's how they are.
-From here, she looks beautiful.

382
00:50:29,929 --> 00:50:31,929
Zhivago, I think you're a hard case.

383
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:37,932
Lara. Lara!

384
00:50:37,932 --> 00:50:40,933
There's a child in the case.
Her daughter.

385
00:50:40,933 --> 00:50:42,933
Oh, for heaven's sake, Boris.

386
00:50:42,933 --> 00:50:45,934
She might've thought about Lara
before she did it.

387
00:50:46,935 --> 00:50:48,936
-Does the girl know?
-I'm afraid she does.

388
00:50:49,936 --> 00:50:50,936
-Is she here?
-Yes.

389
00:50:50,936 --> 00:50:54,938
Well, tell her that
her mother's going to live.

390
00:50:55,938 --> 00:50:59,939
-Wait a minute, Victor. Yuri.
-Yes, of course.

391
00:51:01,940 --> 00:51:05,942
-What are we gonna say about this?
-Must we say anything?

392
00:51:06,942 --> 00:51:09,943
I'm afraid so.
I'm taking her to the hospital.

393
00:51:09,943 --> 00:51:12,944
You know that needn't be difficult.

394
00:53:37,997 --> 00:53:40,998
-What's the name of your assistant?
-Zhivago.

395
00:53:40,998 --> 00:53:44,999
-Andreyevich?
-Yes, why? Do you know him?

396
00:53:44,999 --> 00:53:49,001
-No, I knew his father slightly.
-Right.

397
00:53:58,004 --> 00:54:02,005
Cheer up. I'll have the
poor bitch in hospital tonight.

398
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:04,006
What's his name?

399
00:54:04,006 --> 00:54:07,007
That's Victor Komarovsky.
He says he knows you.

400
00:54:07,007 --> 00:54:10,008
-He executed my father's will.
-Oh.

401
00:54:10,008 --> 00:54:12,009
Uncle Alex turned it down.

402
00:54:12,009 --> 00:54:17,011
Komarovsky said there wasn't much
in it, and what was there was his.

403
00:54:17,011 --> 00:54:21,012
He's a very good businessman.
But I doubt that he's crooked.

404
00:54:21,012 --> 00:54:25,014
Very good company. Knows life.

405
00:54:25,014 --> 00:54:27,014
He's had a bad scare tonight.

406
00:54:45,021 --> 00:54:47,021
You don't mind coming here, do you?

407
00:54:47,021 --> 00:54:51,023
No, no. It reminds me of my youth.

408
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:55,024
-I went to the hospital again.
-And?

409
00:54:56,025 --> 00:54:59,026
She wants you to forgive her.
For her suspicions.

410
00:54:59,026 --> 00:55:02,027
You can tell her
the truth if you like.

411
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:11,030
-Is this him?
-Yes.

412
00:55:11,030 --> 00:55:13,031
-He knows nothing about--
-No!

413
00:55:19,033 --> 00:55:22,034
Pasha, this is Monsieur Komarovsky.

414
00:55:25,035 --> 00:55:26,036
Please.

415
00:55:34,038 --> 00:55:36,039
-Will you eat?
-No, thank you.

416
00:55:36,039 --> 00:55:39,040
I hope you don't think
this is impertinent.

417
00:55:40,041 --> 00:55:41,041
Not at all.

418
00:55:41,041 --> 00:55:46,043
I've advised Lara's mother for years.
I'm interested in what happens to her.

419
00:55:46,043 --> 00:55:49,044
--something I have to tell you
and that is this:

420
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,045
I am committed to the Revolution.

421
00:55:52,045 --> 00:55:56,046
Nothing, not even Lara. . .

422
00:55:56,046 --> 00:55:58,047
. . .has more importance for me.

423
00:56:00,048 --> 00:56:04,049
You misunderstand.
Your political views don't concern me.

424
00:56:04,049 --> 00:56:07,050
I'm probably more sympathetic
than you suppose.

425
00:56:07,050 --> 00:56:11,052
I have a few contacts of my own
which might surprise you.

426
00:56:11,052 --> 00:56:14,053
-How will you live?
-I have a teaching post.

427
00:56:14,053 --> 00:56:17,054
-May I know where?
-Gradov, in the Urals.

428
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:22,056
-I know it. Not much of a place.
-It's beautiful country, monsieur.

429
00:56:22,056 --> 00:56:26,057
-Be a quiet life, won't it?
-That's what we want.

430
00:56:26,057 --> 00:56:29,058
You'll excuse me:
Will your salary be adequate?

431
00:56:29,058 --> 00:56:31,059
Adequate, not more.

432
00:56:34,060 --> 00:56:37,061
Pavel Pavlovich,
my chief impression. . .

433
00:56:37,061 --> 00:56:40,062
. . .and I mean no offense,
is that you're very young.

434
00:56:41,063 --> 00:56:46,064
Monsieur, I hope I don't offend you.
Do people improve with age?

435
00:56:46,064 --> 00:56:50,066
-They grow more tolerant.
-To tolerate more in themselves.

436
00:56:50,066 --> 00:56:53,067
What do older people
bring to their marriage?

437
00:56:53,067 --> 00:56:56,068
A little experience.

438
00:56:56,068 --> 00:56:59,069
I'm 26. My mother died
needlessly when I was 8.

439
00:56:59,069 --> 00:57:03,071
My father died in prison.
I have fended for myself.

440
00:57:03,071 --> 00:57:05,071
I've worked my way through school.

441
00:57:05,071 --> 00:57:09,073
I am familiar with things
you can hardly guess at.

442
00:57:09,073 --> 00:57:11,073
This is experience
of a kind, certainly.

443
00:57:12,074 --> 00:57:15,075
I've no amorous experience,
if that's what you mean.

444
00:57:15,075 --> 00:57:18,076
Lara's 1 7. That speaks for itself.

445
00:57:19,076 --> 00:57:21,077
You probably find
this situation comic.

446
00:57:22,077 --> 00:57:24,078
We don't. We will marry next year.

447
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:36,082
-I hope I haven't offended you.
-Not at all. Admirable.

448
00:57:44,085 --> 00:57:45,086
A young crusader.

449
00:57:46,086 --> 00:57:48,087
-He's--
-He's a very fine young man.

450
00:57:48,087 --> 00:57:50,088
That's obvious.

451
00:57:50,088 --> 00:57:53,089
You're very generous,
Monsieur Komarovsky.

452
00:57:56,090 --> 00:57:58,090
Larissa, I want to talk to you.

453
00:58:07,094 --> 00:58:09,094
Monsieur Komarovsky, have you--?

454
00:58:09,094 --> 00:58:14,096
I beg you, drop this affectation
of calling me "Monsieur Komarovsky. "

455
00:58:15,097 --> 00:58:18,098
Under the circumstances,
I find it rather ridiculous.

456
00:58:19,098 --> 00:58:22,099
I shall save you
from a dreadful error.

457
00:58:22,099 --> 00:58:26,101
There are two kinds of men.
That young man is one kind.

458
00:58:26,101 --> 00:58:28,101
He is high-minded. He is pure.

459
00:58:28,101 --> 00:58:33,103
The kind of man the world
pretends to look up to, but despises.

460
00:58:33,103 --> 00:58:38,105
The kind of man who breeds
unhappiness, particularly in women.

461
00:58:38,105 --> 00:58:39,105
-Understand?
-No.

462
00:58:39,105 --> 00:58:41,106
I think you do.

463
00:58:41,106 --> 00:58:43,107
There's another kind.

464
00:58:43,107 --> 00:58:46,108
Not high-minded.
Not pure. But alive.

465
00:58:47,108 --> 00:58:51,110
That your tastes should favor
the juvenile is understandable.

466
00:58:51,110 --> 00:58:54,111
But for you to marry him
would be a disaster.

467
00:58:54,111 --> 00:58:56,111
Because there's two kinds of women.

468
00:58:58,112 --> 00:59:02,114
Two kinds of women. And you, as we
well know, are not the first kind.

469
00:59:06,115 --> 00:59:08,116
You, my dear. . .

470
00:59:08,116 --> 00:59:10,116
. . .are a slut.

471
00:59:10,116 --> 00:59:12,117
I am not!

472
00:59:13,117 --> 00:59:15,118
We'll see.

473
00:59:57,133 --> 01:00:02,135
Don't delude yourself this was rape.
That would flatter us both.

474
01:00:45,151 --> 01:00:48,152
-The master's not home, Miss Lara.
-Not at home?

475
01:00:48,152 --> 01:00:51,153
No. He went to the
Sventytskis' Christmas party.

476
01:00:53,154 --> 01:00:58,155
Are you going there, miss?
Please don't say I told you.

477
01:00:58,155 --> 01:01:02,157
-No. Thank you, Piotr!
-Merry Christmas, Miss Lara!

478
01:01:03,157 --> 01:01:06,158
Thank you and merry Christmas to you.

479
01:01:11,160 --> 01:01:14,161
Merry Christmas, Yuri Andreyevich.

480
01:01:53,175 --> 01:01:55,176
What's the matter?

481
01:01:59,177 --> 01:02:01,178
We had an appointment this evening.

482
01:02:01,178 --> 01:02:06,180
-Haven't you read the letter?
-I've not been home. I'm going now.

483
01:02:08,181 --> 01:02:11,182
Where are you going?
I've a right to know.

484
01:02:11,182 --> 01:02:13,182
Lara, what's in this letter?

485
01:02:14,183 --> 01:02:16,184
What's in this letter?

486
01:02:17,184 --> 01:02:21,185
-Are you breaking--?
-It's all in the letter.

487
01:02:21,185 --> 01:02:23,186
-What is?
-Everything.

488
01:02:24,186 --> 01:02:25,187
Don't!

489
01:03:27,209 --> 01:03:30,210
There's an extraordinary girl
at this party.

490
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,211
I know. I'm dancing with her.

491
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:37,213
-You're keen tonight, Victor.
-I like to win.

492
01:03:38,213 --> 01:03:42,215
Silence! Silence, everybody.
Silence, please.

493
01:03:43,215 --> 01:03:46,216
I have a very delightful
announcement to make.

494
01:03:48,217 --> 01:03:52,218
-Oh, Madame Sventytski.
-Yes, why not?

495
01:03:53,219 --> 01:03:57,220
I have to announce that
Dr. Yuri Zhivago, yes, Dr. Zhivago. . .

496
01:03:57,220 --> 01:04:00,221
. . .he came third in all Moscow.

497
01:04:01,221 --> 01:04:03,222
Now, listen. Please, please.

498
01:04:04,223 --> 01:04:07,224
Dr. Zhivago is betrothed
in marriage to--

499
01:04:29,232 --> 01:04:31,232
My dear Victor!

500
01:04:31,232 --> 01:04:33,233
My dear man.

501
01:04:33,233 --> 01:04:35,234
-Get her out.
-What?

502
01:04:36,234 --> 01:04:38,235
Get her out. Get her out!

503
01:04:38,235 --> 01:04:41,236
-Yes, yes. I'll get the police.
-No!

504
01:04:42,236 --> 01:04:44,237
-Don't get the police.
-Leave me!

505
01:04:44,237 --> 01:04:47,238
I do not want the police.
Just get her out!

506
01:05:05,245 --> 01:05:07,245
Let her go.

507
01:05:30,254 --> 01:05:33,255
Please. Quiet, friends.
Please give way, yes?

508
01:05:33,255 --> 01:05:36,256
Please, would you mind?

509
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:39,257
Would you mind? Thank you.

510
01:05:51,261 --> 01:05:54,262
-Our destinies seem to be interwoven.
-Yes.

511
01:05:55,263 --> 01:05:59,264
-I was a close friend of your father.
-I knew you were his business partner.

512
01:06:00,264 --> 01:06:03,266
Rather more than that.
I was present at his death.

513
01:06:05,266 --> 01:06:07,267
Also, I'm in contact
with your brother.

514
01:06:08,267 --> 01:06:09,268
Yevgraf?

515
01:06:09,268 --> 01:06:14,269
I'm in contact with those in contact
with him. I disagree with Bolshevism.

516
01:06:14,269 --> 01:06:15,270
Thank you.

517
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:18,271
You seem to know your trade.

518
01:06:18,271 --> 01:06:22,272
But I can still
admire Bolsheviks as men.

519
01:06:23,273 --> 01:06:25,273
Shall I tell you why?

520
01:06:25,273 --> 01:06:27,274
Yes.

521
01:06:28,275 --> 01:06:30,275
They may win.

522
01:06:33,276 --> 01:06:37,278
I'd like to meet him. Yevgraf.
He sent me a marvelous letter.

523
01:06:38,278 --> 01:06:42,280
-He likes my poetry.
-That would've pleased your father.

524
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:46,281
Your father was not a bad man, Yuri.
If I may call you Yuri.

525
01:06:47,281 --> 01:06:48,282
I hardly knew him.

526
01:06:49,282 --> 01:06:52,283
You, perhaps, may not credit this. . .

527
01:06:53,284 --> 01:06:56,285
. . .but he was devoted to your mother.

528
01:07:09,289 --> 01:07:12,290
May I continue to rely
on your professional discretion?

529
01:07:14,291 --> 01:07:19,293
You mean, will I tell anyone
the truth about that girl?

530
01:07:19,293 --> 01:07:21,294
That's what I mean, yes.

531
01:07:22,294 --> 01:07:27,296
You may continue to rely
on my professional. . .et cetera.

532
01:07:27,296 --> 01:07:29,297
You are fastidious, aren't you?

533
01:07:30,297 --> 01:07:35,299
What happens to a girl like that
when a man like you is done with her?

534
01:07:35,299 --> 01:07:39,300
Interested? I give her to you.

535
01:07:42,301 --> 01:07:45,302
You shouldn't smoke.
You've had a shock.

536
01:07:51,305 --> 01:07:54,306
I give her to you, Yuri Andreyevich.

537
01:07:55,306 --> 01:07:56,306
A wedding present.

538
01:09:07,332 --> 01:09:09,333
Where have you seen that girl before?

539
01:09:09,333 --> 01:09:13,334
-What makes you think I've seen her?
-Haven't you?

540
01:09:14,334 --> 01:09:16,335
-Yes.
-Where?

541
01:09:16,335 --> 01:09:19,336
I'm not supposed to say.
It was on a case. Her mother--

542
01:09:19,336 --> 01:09:22,337
No, don't tell me if you shouldn't.

543
01:10:00,351 --> 01:10:04,353
To the bourgeois, it was a war
between the Allies and Germany.

544
01:10:04,353 --> 01:10:08,354
To the Bolsheviks, the Allied
and the German upper classes.

545
01:10:09,354 --> 01:10:12,355
And which of them won
was a matter of indifference.

546
01:10:28,361 --> 01:10:33,363
I was ordered by the Party to enlist.
I gave my name as Petrov.

547
01:10:34,363 --> 01:10:36,364
They shouted for victory
all over Europe...

548
01:10:36,364 --> 01:10:39,365
...prayed for victory,
to the same God.

549
01:10:39,365 --> 01:10:44,367
My task, the Party's task,
was to organize defeat.

550
01:10:44,367 --> 01:10:47,368
From defeat would
spring the Revolution.

551
01:10:47,368 --> 01:10:50,369
And the Revolution would be
victory for us.

552
01:10:50,369 --> 01:10:53,370
The Party looked
to the conscript peasants.

553
01:10:53,370 --> 01:10:56,371
Most of them wearing
their first good pair of boots.

554
01:10:57,372 --> 01:11:00,373
When the boots wore out,
they'd be ready to listen.

555
01:11:00,373 --> 01:11:04,374
Later, I took three battalions
with me out of the front line.

556
01:11:04,374 --> 01:11:06,375
The best day's work I ever did.

557
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:09,376
For now, there was nothing to be done.

558
01:11:09,376 --> 01:11:14,378
There were too many volunteers,
like me. Mostly it was mere hysteria.

559
01:11:15,378 --> 01:11:19,380
There were men with better motives,
who saw that times were critical...

560
01:11:20,380 --> 01:11:22,381
...and wanted a man 's part.
Good men, wasted.

561
01:11:23,381 --> 01:11:27,383
Unhappy men too.
Unhappy in their jobs.

562
01:11:27,383 --> 01:11:29,383
Unhappy with their wives.

563
01:11:30,384 --> 01:11:32,384
Doubting themselves.

564
01:11:32,384 --> 01:11:34,385
Happy men don 't volunteer.

565
01:11:35,385 --> 01:11:39,387
They wait their turn and thank God
if their age or work delays it.

566
01:11:40,387 --> 01:11:44,389
The ones who got back home at the
price of an arm, an eye or a leg...

567
01:11:45,389 --> 01:11:46,389
... these were the lucky ones.

568
01:11:52,392 --> 01:11:55,393
Even Comrade Lenin underestimated...

569
01:11:55,393 --> 01:11:58,394
...both the anguish
of that 900-mile-long front...

570
01:11:59,394 --> 01:12:02,395
...and our cursed capacity
for suffering.

571
01:12:04,396 --> 01:12:07,397
By the second winter of the war...

572
01:12:07,397 --> 01:12:10,398
... the boots had worn out...

573
01:12:10,398 --> 01:12:13,399
...but the line still held.

574
01:12:13,399 --> 01:12:16,400
Their greatcoats fell
to pieces on their backs.

575
01:12:17,401 --> 01:12:19,401
Their rations were irregular.

576
01:12:19,401 --> 01:12:24,403
Half of them went into action without
arms, led by men they didn 't trust.

577
01:12:25,403 --> 01:12:26,404
Come on, you bastards!

578
01:12:28,405 --> 01:12:30,405
And those they did trust....

579
01:12:30,405 --> 01:12:32,406
Come on, comrades, come on!

580
01:12:33,406 --> 01:12:34,407
Come on!

581
01:12:36,407 --> 01:12:38,408
Come on!

582
01:12:49,412 --> 01:12:53,414
Comrades! Earthshakers! Show them!

583
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:59,416
Charge them!

584
01:13:18,423 --> 01:13:23,424
At last, they did what
all the armies dreamed of doing.

585
01:13:23,424 --> 01:13:25,425
They began to go home.

586
01:13:35,429 --> 01:13:38,430
That was the beginning
of the Revolution.

587
01:14:02,438 --> 01:14:03,439
Deserters.

588
01:14:04,439 --> 01:14:05,440
Replacements.

589
01:14:17,444 --> 01:14:19,445
Tote. . .

590
01:14:20,445 --> 01:14:21,445
. . .arms!

591
01:14:28,448 --> 01:14:30,449
Come back!

592
01:14:30,449 --> 01:14:32,449
Stick together!

593
01:14:35,450 --> 01:14:38,451
Stick together and we'll be all right.

594
01:14:38,451 --> 01:14:40,452
And be ready for them.

595
01:15:05,461 --> 01:15:07,462
-Turn round, lads.
-Don't go any further.

596
01:15:07,462 --> 01:15:11,463
-Come on, turn around.
-Pigs for the slaughter.

597
01:15:11,463 --> 01:15:13,464
Turn round, lads!

598
01:15:15,465 --> 01:15:21,467
Don't listen to them.
Get back in your ranks, I say!

599
01:15:21,467 --> 01:15:24,468
Don't pay any attention
to those cowards!

600
01:15:24,468 --> 01:15:28,470
No more war! No more war!

601
01:15:34,472 --> 01:15:38,473
Listen, lads. Ten miles
up that road are the Germans!

602
01:15:40,474 --> 01:15:42,475
-Rubbish!
-It's not rubbish. They're coming.

603
01:15:43,475 --> 01:15:45,476
And they're coming fast.

604
01:15:45,476 --> 01:15:47,476
You've let them in!

605
01:15:49,477 --> 01:15:52,478
They're coming for your wives,
your houses. . .

606
01:15:53,479 --> 01:15:56,480
-. . .your country.
-Your country, officer!

607
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,481
Yes, my country! And proud--

608
01:16:14,486 --> 01:16:16,487
Get back in your ranks!

609
01:16:17,487 --> 01:16:19,488
Get back in your ranks, I say!

610
01:16:24,490 --> 01:16:25,490
Get back!

611
01:16:28,491 --> 01:16:30,492
Get back in ranks!

612
01:17:43,518 --> 01:17:46,519
-Are you a nurse?
-Yes.

613
01:17:46,519 --> 01:17:48,520
-Are you all right?
-Yes.

614
01:17:48,520 --> 01:17:50,521
Then help me.

615
01:18:17,531 --> 01:18:19,531
I'm not a trained nurse,
I'm a volunteer.

616
01:18:20,532 --> 01:18:24,533
I see, right. Why did you volunteer?

617
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,534
-I came here to find my husband.
-Very gently.

618
01:18:27,534 --> 01:18:30,535
-Have you ever seen an operation?
-Yes.

619
01:18:30,535 --> 01:18:31,536
We'll manage.

620
01:18:43,540 --> 01:18:47,541
They're in the next village,
brothers! The Germans.

621
01:18:47,541 --> 01:18:49,542
-Your Honor--
-Keep still.

622
01:19:18,553 --> 01:19:20,553
Did you find your husband?

623
01:19:21,554 --> 01:19:22,554
No.

624
01:19:22,554 --> 01:19:26,555
-Your Honor. . . .
-Yes, we'd better be off.

625
01:19:41,561 --> 01:19:44,562
You often look at me
as though you knew me.

626
01:19:44,562 --> 01:19:48,563
I have seen you. Four years ago,
Christmas Eve.

627
01:19:49,564 --> 01:19:51,564
Were you there?

628
01:19:52,565 --> 01:19:54,566
No wonder you look at me.

629
01:19:55,566 --> 01:19:59,567
-Did you know Victor Komarovsky?
-Yes, I did.

630
01:19:59,567 --> 01:20:02,568
-That young man who took you away. . . .
-My husband.

631
01:20:02,568 --> 01:20:05,570
A lot of courage.
He made us look very feeble.

632
01:20:05,570 --> 01:20:10,571
As a matter of fact, I thought
you both did. Good man to shoot at.

633
01:20:11,572 --> 01:20:13,572
I'd give anything
never to have met him.

634
01:20:42,583 --> 01:20:44,584
The Tsar's in prison.

635
01:20:45,584 --> 01:20:47,585
Lenin's in Moscow!

636
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:51,586
-Civil war has started.
-Good!

637
01:20:51,586 --> 01:20:53,587
Civil war, good?

638
01:20:54,587 --> 01:20:56,588
Not good, Comrade Nurse. Inevitable.

639
01:20:57,588 --> 01:21:00,589
But Lenin in Moscow!

640
01:21:01,590 --> 01:21:04,591
This Lenin, will he be
the new Tsar then?

641
01:21:05,591 --> 01:21:09,593
Listen, Daddy, no more Tsars,
no more masters!

642
01:21:09,593 --> 01:21:12,594
Only workers in a workers' state!
How about that?

643
01:21:13,594 --> 01:21:15,595
-Are you a doctor?
-Yes.

644
01:21:15,595 --> 01:21:17,596
Follow me, please.

645
01:22:02,612 --> 01:22:04,613
I can't deal with this.

646
01:22:04,613 --> 01:22:07,614
Order of the Provisional Government.
You'll have to try.

647
01:22:15,616 --> 01:22:18,618
"If you could see how hard
we've been working. . .

648
01:22:18,618 --> 01:22:21,619
. . .I'm sure you'd forgive me
for not writing more. "

649
01:22:21,619 --> 01:22:24,620
-When was that written?
-July 20th.

650
01:22:24,620 --> 01:22:25,620
Eight weeks!

651
01:22:25,620 --> 01:22:28,621
"But now the war seems
to have stopped.

652
01:22:28,621 --> 01:22:31,622
The hospital is emptying,
and I shall have more time.

653
01:22:31,622 --> 01:22:36,624
I may even get time to write some
verse, if I've not forgotten how to. "

654
01:22:36,624 --> 01:22:38,625
Oh, I do hope so.

655
01:22:40,626 --> 01:22:44,627
"Larissa Antipova is still here,
and I admire her more and more.

656
01:22:45,627 --> 01:22:49,629
She has that strange gift of healing,
which doctors don't believe in.

657
01:22:50,629 --> 01:22:54,631
She often does the wrong things,
but it always seems to work out right.

658
01:22:55,631 --> 01:22:58,632
How is Uncle Alex?
Can he still get his tobacco?"

659
01:22:58,632 --> 01:23:00,633
Would that he could.

660
01:23:00,633 --> 01:23:03,634
"Can Sasha say his letters yet?
And how is Auntie Anna?"

661
01:23:04,634 --> 01:23:06,635
He didn't get my letter.

662
01:23:07,635 --> 01:23:10,636
"Most of all, my dearest,
how are you?"

663
01:23:10,636 --> 01:23:13,637
Strangely upsetting,
he doesn't know she's dead.

664
01:23:14,638 --> 01:23:17,639
Can't see what difference it makes.

665
01:23:17,639 --> 01:23:19,640
They're at it again!

666
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,641
I wish they'd decide
once and for all. . .

667
01:23:23,641 --> 01:23:28,643
. . .which gang of hooligans constitutes
the government of this country!

668
01:23:34,645 --> 01:23:35,645
Cheer up, Sergei.

669
01:23:36,646 --> 01:23:38,646
Don't you want to go home?

670
01:23:38,646 --> 01:23:42,648
There's fighting at home, Your Honor.
I've had enough.

671
01:23:42,648 --> 01:23:46,649
Red Guards and White Guards. . . .
The old man's had enough.

672
01:23:47,650 --> 01:23:49,650
Your Honor is a kind gentleman.

673
01:23:52,652 --> 01:23:54,652
And the nurse is a kind lady!

674
01:24:08,657 --> 01:24:11,658
-Finished?
-Just about.

675
01:24:19,661 --> 01:24:24,663
-In a while, you'll be with your girl.
-If I can get on a train.

676
01:24:26,664 --> 01:24:30,665
I want to be with Katya
more than anything in the world.

677
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:31,666
Yes, of course.

678
01:24:32,666 --> 01:24:35,667
But now that we're going, I feel sad.

679
01:24:37,668 --> 01:24:40,669
Sad. Really sad.

680
01:24:41,669 --> 01:24:43,670
Well, we've been here some time.

681
01:24:45,671 --> 01:24:49,672
This must have been a lovely
house once. Don't you think?

682
01:24:50,672 --> 01:24:51,673
What are you going to do?

683
01:24:52,673 --> 01:24:54,674
-In Gradov?
-Yes.

684
01:24:55,674 --> 01:24:59,676
-I'll be all right.
-I wish I could think so.

685
01:25:04,677 --> 01:25:06,678
You could run a laundry.

686
01:25:07,679 --> 01:25:08,679
What will you do?

687
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:11,680
I suppose I'll go back
to the hospital.

688
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,681
It's funny to think of you there.

689
01:25:18,683 --> 01:25:20,683
I used to pass it on my way to school.

690
01:25:21,684 --> 01:25:25,685
-Do you ever come to Moscow?
-From Gradov?

691
01:25:25,685 --> 01:25:28,686
If only there were someone
to look after you.

692
01:25:28,686 --> 01:25:31,687
Of course, if there were,
I'd be destroyed by jealousy.

693
01:25:31,687 --> 01:25:33,688
Zhivago, don't.

694
01:25:36,689 --> 01:25:38,690
My dear. . . .

695
01:25:38,690 --> 01:25:40,690
Don't, please.

696
01:25:45,692 --> 01:25:47,693
Now, look what you've made me do.

697
01:25:52,695 --> 01:25:56,696
Yuri, we've been
together six months. . .

698
01:25:56,696 --> 01:25:58,697
. . .on the road and here.

699
01:25:58,697 --> 01:26:02,698
We've not done anything
you'll have to lie about to Tonya.

700
01:26:03,699 --> 01:26:05,700
I don't want you to have
to lie about me.

701
01:26:07,700 --> 01:26:09,701
You understand that, Yuri?

702
01:26:12,702 --> 01:26:14,703
You understand everything.

703
01:26:23,706 --> 01:26:26,707
Come on, comrades! I'm in a hurry!

704
01:26:26,707 --> 01:26:27,707
Going home, Kirill?

705
01:26:27,707 --> 01:26:31,709
Home, Your Excellency? Petrograd.
I'm joining the Red Guard.

706
01:26:32,709 --> 01:26:34,710
What about your wife?

707
01:26:34,710 --> 01:26:37,711
Sometimes, Comrade Nurse,
women have to wait.

708
01:26:37,711 --> 01:26:40,712
Right. Goodbye, honored doctor.

709
01:26:41,713 --> 01:26:42,713
Want some advice?

710
01:26:42,713 --> 01:26:47,715
-Said the millstone to the barley.
-That's right. Adapt yourself.

711
01:26:54,717 --> 01:26:57,718
-Goodbye, lvanov.
-Goodbye, Your Honor.

712
01:26:59,719 --> 01:27:00,719
Goodbye, Andre.

713
01:27:01,720 --> 01:27:03,720
Goodbye, Simeon.

714
01:27:06,722 --> 01:27:10,723
I'll never forget Your Honor. Never.

715
01:27:11,723 --> 01:27:13,724
Goodbye, Zhivago.

716
01:27:14,724 --> 01:27:16,725
Goodbye. Thank you.

717
01:27:19,726 --> 01:27:20,727
Pilenko.

718
01:27:46,736 --> 01:27:47,736
Giddap!

719
01:27:57,740 --> 01:28:00,741
-Goodbye, brothers!
-Goodbye!

720
01:28:43,757 --> 01:28:45,757
The doctor is a gentleman.

721
01:28:45,757 --> 01:28:48,758
-Right. Written all over him.
-He's a good man.

722
01:28:48,758 --> 01:28:51,759
God rot good men.

723
01:29:06,765 --> 01:29:08,766
Yuri!

724
01:29:38,776 --> 01:29:42,778
This is Comrade Yelkin,
our local delegate. He lives here.

725
01:29:43,778 --> 01:29:44,779
How do you do?

726
01:29:45,779 --> 01:29:46,779
Welcome.

727
01:29:47,780 --> 01:29:49,780
-Comrade Kaprugina.
-Welcome.

728
01:29:49,780 --> 01:29:51,781
It's not for you to welcome us.

729
01:29:52,781 --> 01:29:56,783
Comrade Kaprugina is the Chairman
of the Residents' Committee.

730
01:29:56,783 --> 01:29:58,784
-Yes, of course.
-Your discharge papers?

731
01:30:01,785 --> 01:30:04,786
I signed them myself, I'm afraid.

732
01:30:09,788 --> 01:30:11,788
Holy Cross? What?

733
01:30:12,789 --> 01:30:16,790
-Holy Cross Hospital, it's on--
-The Second Reformed Hospital.

734
01:30:18,791 --> 01:30:20,792
Good. It needed reforming.

735
01:30:25,793 --> 01:30:28,794
Medicals report
to their place of work at once.

736
01:30:29,795 --> 01:30:31,796
Yes, I believe there's typhus.

737
01:30:32,796 --> 01:30:37,798
You've been listening to rumormongers.
There is no typhus in our city.

738
01:30:37,798 --> 01:30:41,799
Well, that's good news.
I'll report tomorrow.

739
01:30:41,799 --> 01:30:44,800
When you've started work,
you'll get a ration book.

740
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,801
I've always worked.

741
01:30:51,803 --> 01:30:55,804
-Whatever is the matter?
-You are.

742
01:30:57,805 --> 01:31:02,807
There was living space
for 1 3 families in this one house.

743
01:31:05,808 --> 01:31:09,809
Yes, this is a better arrangement,
comrades. More just.

744
01:31:17,812 --> 01:31:20,813
But it is more just.
Why did it sound so funny?

745
01:31:30,817 --> 01:31:32,818
Is it good to be home?

746
01:31:41,821 --> 01:31:43,822
-Sasha?
-Who else?

747
01:31:46,823 --> 01:31:49,824
-This is your daddy, Sasha.
-Sasha.

748
01:31:50,824 --> 01:31:51,824
Sasha!

749
01:31:52,825 --> 01:31:56,826
-Naughty boy!
-No, don't say that.

750
01:31:57,827 --> 01:31:58,827
May I come in?

751
01:32:01,828 --> 01:32:02,828
Watch carefully.

752
01:32:03,829 --> 01:32:08,831
I'm about to ignite the last half
of the last cigar in Moscow.

753
01:32:09,831 --> 01:32:11,832
-Good meal?
-Very.

754
01:32:11,832 --> 01:32:12,832
Say something.

755
01:32:14,833 --> 01:32:17,834
-That was very good, Tonya.
-That was nothing.

756
01:32:17,834 --> 01:32:20,835
She saved that salami
for three months.

757
01:32:20,835 --> 01:32:23,836
-Have you, darling?
-I got it for a clock.

758
01:32:23,836 --> 01:32:26,837
She's a marvel. Coffee, you observe.

759
01:32:26,837 --> 01:32:29,838
Stop it, Daddy.
He knows I'm a marvel.

760
01:32:30,839 --> 01:32:33,840
-Did you write any poetry?
-Quite a lot.

761
01:32:33,840 --> 01:32:35,840
Is it good?

762
01:32:35,840 --> 01:32:38,841
Yes. I think so.

763
01:32:38,841 --> 01:32:41,843
-Can I see it?
-But of course.

764
01:32:43,843 --> 01:32:47,845
What happened to Nurse Antipova?
Your letters were full of her.

765
01:32:48,845 --> 01:32:50,846
Yes, I suppose they were.

766
01:32:50,846 --> 01:32:53,847
The girl who shot
friend Komarovsky, isn't it?

767
01:32:53,847 --> 01:32:55,848
Yes, Daddy. You know it is.

768
01:32:55,848 --> 01:32:58,849
She's gone home to her little girl.

769
01:32:58,849 --> 01:33:01,850
-Oh, we shan't see her then?
-No.

770
01:33:01,850 --> 01:33:03,850
What a pity.

771
01:33:11,853 --> 01:33:14,854
Farewell, the pleasures of the flesh.

772
01:33:15,855 --> 01:33:19,856
What I don't understand is how
we'll stay alive this winter.

773
01:33:23,858 --> 01:33:25,858
You have no right
to call me from work.

774
01:33:26,859 --> 01:33:29,860
-As a Soviet Deputy, l--
-That gives you power, not the right.

775
01:33:29,860 --> 01:33:32,861
It's noticed, you know.
Your attitude is noticed.

776
01:33:33,861 --> 01:33:35,862
You should have called
the area doctor.

777
01:33:35,862 --> 01:33:37,863
I want this done quietly.

778
01:33:38,863 --> 01:33:40,864
Why, what is it? Typhus?

779
01:33:49,867 --> 01:33:52,868
I'll take him away.
Get me some transport.

780
01:33:52,868 --> 01:33:54,869
It isn't typhus.

781
01:33:55,869 --> 01:33:58,870
It's another disease we don't have
in Moscow: starvation.

782
01:33:58,870 --> 01:34:02,872
-That gives you satisfaction?
-It'd satisfy me to hear you admit it.

783
01:34:02,872 --> 01:34:05,873
-Would it? Why?
-Because it is so.

784
01:34:06,873 --> 01:34:10,875
Your attitude is noticed, you know.
Oh, yes, it's been noticed.

785
01:34:13,876 --> 01:34:15,876
-Yuri!
-Hello.

786
01:34:19,878 --> 01:34:21,879
The stove's out.

787
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,881
Tonya, the stove's out.

788
01:34:27,881 --> 01:34:31,882
What's wrong with you?
No wonder he's losing weight.

789
01:34:38,885 --> 01:34:44,887
She lets it out as soon as you go
and lights it before you come home.

790
01:34:56,891 --> 01:34:58,892
We haven't enough fuel.

791
01:35:16,898 --> 01:35:18,899
I told myself it was beneath
my dignity...

792
01:35:18,899 --> 01:35:21,900
... to arrest a man
for pilfering firewood.

793
01:35:24,901 --> 01:35:26,902
But nothing ordered by the Party
is beneath dignity...

794
01:35:27,902 --> 01:35:28,903
...and the Party was right.

795
01:35:28,903 --> 01:35:31,904
One man desperate
for a bit of fuel is pathetic.

796
01:35:32,904 --> 01:35:35,905
Five million people desperate
for fuel will destroy a city.

797
01:35:36,906 --> 01:35:40,907
That was the first time I ever saw
my brother. But I knew him.

798
01:35:41,907 --> 01:35:43,908
And I knew that I would
disobey the Party.

799
01:35:44,909 --> 01:35:47,910
Perhaps it was the tie of blood
between us, but I doubt it.

800
01:35:47,910 --> 01:35:51,911
We were only half-tied.
Brothers will betray a brother.

801
01:35:51,911 --> 01:35:52,911
As a policeman, I'd say:

802
01:35:53,912 --> 01:35:56,913
"Get hold of a man 's brother,
and you're halfway home. "

803
01:35:56,913 --> 01:36:00,914
Nor was it admiration
for a better man than me.

804
01:36:00,914 --> 01:36:04,916
I did admire him, but I didn 't
think he was a better man.

805
01:36:04,916 --> 01:36:08,917
Besides, I've executed better men
than me with a small pistol.

806
01:36:38,928 --> 01:36:41,929
You'll have to live like
the rest of us, doctor.

807
01:36:41,929 --> 01:36:43,930
Bring it back! Bring that back!

808
01:36:44,930 --> 01:36:46,931
Oh, listen to His Excellency.

809
01:36:48,932 --> 01:36:52,933
I want no anarchy!
I want this carried out correctly.

810
01:36:55,934 --> 01:36:58,935
-What are you doing?
-Reallocation of living space.

811
01:36:58,935 --> 01:37:01,936
50 square meters per family
of less than five.

812
01:37:01,936 --> 01:37:05,938
-Damn it, whose house is this anyway?
-Father, be quiet!

813
01:37:05,938 --> 01:37:08,939
50 square meters!
What're you doing with my things?

814
01:37:08,939 --> 01:37:11,940
-They're being stored.
-They're being stolen.

815
01:37:12,940 --> 01:37:14,941
Just a minute!

816
01:37:23,944 --> 01:37:26,945
-And where did you get this?
-I pulled it out of a fence.

817
01:37:53,955 --> 01:37:55,956
I told them who I was.

818
01:37:56,956 --> 01:38:00,958
The old man was hostile.
The girl, cautious.

819
01:38:00,958 --> 01:38:02,958
My brother...

820
01:38:03,959 --> 01:38:05,959
...seemed very pleased.

821
01:38:08,961 --> 01:38:12,962
I think the girl was the only one
who guessed at their position.

822
01:38:14,963 --> 01:38:17,964
You're just as I imagined:
my political conscience.

823
01:38:17,964 --> 01:38:21,965
I asked him, hadn 't he one of his own?
So he talked about the Revolution.

824
01:38:22,966 --> 01:38:26,967
You lay life on a table, and you
cut out all the tumors of injustice.

825
01:38:26,967 --> 01:38:29,968
I told him if he felt like that,
he shouldjoin the Party.

826
01:38:30,969 --> 01:38:33,970
Cutting out the tumors
of injustice is a deep operation.

827
01:38:33,970 --> 01:38:38,971
Someone must keep life alive while you
do it, by living. Isn't that right?

828
01:38:38,971 --> 01:38:40,972
I thought, then, it was wrong.

829
01:38:41,972 --> 01:38:45,974
He told me what he thought
of the Party and I trembled for him.

830
01:38:45,974 --> 01:38:49,975
He approved of us, but for reasons
which were subtle, like his verse.

831
01:38:50,976 --> 01:38:53,977
Approval such as his could
vanish overnight. I told him so.

832
01:38:53,977 --> 01:38:57,978
I can't approve tonight
something you may do tomorrow.

833
01:38:57,978 --> 01:39:01,980
He was walking about with a noose
round his neck and didn 't know.

834
01:39:01,980 --> 01:39:05,981
So I told him what
I had heard about his poems.

835
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:08,982
Not liked?

836
01:39:09,983 --> 01:39:11,983
Not liked by whom?

837
01:39:12,984 --> 01:39:13,984
Why not liked?

838
01:39:13,984 --> 01:39:16,985
So I told him that.

839
01:39:24,988 --> 01:39:27,989
Do you think it's "personal,
petit-bourgeois and self-indulgent"?

840
01:39:29,990 --> 01:39:30,990
I lied.

841
01:39:31,991 --> 01:39:32,991
But he believed me.

842
01:39:33,991 --> 01:39:36,992
It struck me through
to see that my opinion mattered.

843
01:39:38,993 --> 01:39:40,994
The girl knew what it meant.

844
01:39:40,994 --> 01:39:43,995
They couldn 't survive
what was coming in the city.

845
01:39:44,995 --> 01:39:46,996
I urged them to live
obscurely in the country...

846
01:39:47,996 --> 01:39:49,997
... where they could stay alive.

847
01:39:49,997 --> 01:39:53,998
We have-- Used to have an estate
at Varykino near Yuryatin.

848
01:39:55,999 --> 01:39:58,000
People know us there.

849
01:39:58,000 --> 01:40:02,001
He didn 't resist. I offered
to obtain permits, passes, warrants.

850
01:40:03,002 --> 01:40:05,002
Told them what to take
and what to leave behind.

851
01:40:09,004 --> 01:40:13,005
I had the impertinence to ask him
for a volume of his poems.

852
01:40:14,006 --> 01:40:15,006
And so we parted.

853
01:40:15,006 --> 01:40:19,008
I think I told him we'd
meet again in better times.

854
01:40:19,008 --> 01:40:21,008
But perhaps I didn 't.

855
01:42:15,049 --> 01:42:18,050
Fifty persons! Fifty persons only!

856
01:42:20,051 --> 01:42:22,052
-Tonya!
-Yes!

857
01:42:24,053 --> 01:42:28,054
Fifty persons only! Get back!

858
01:42:51,062 --> 01:42:53,063
Charming accommodation.

859
01:42:53,063 --> 01:42:57,065
"Charming accommodation. "
That's very good.

860
01:42:57,065 --> 01:42:58,065
I'm an intellectual.

861
01:42:59,065 --> 01:43:02,066
Shut up, you "intellectual. "

862
01:43:03,067 --> 01:43:05,067
Shut up, you lickspittle.

863
01:43:12,070 --> 01:43:13,070
Forced labor.

864
01:43:23,074 --> 01:43:27,075
Attention, comrades, your train
will leave tomorrow morning.

865
01:43:27,075 --> 01:43:29,076
"Health regulations for the journey:

866
01:43:30,076 --> 01:43:32,077
Night soil will be
emptied every morning.

867
01:43:32,077 --> 01:43:36,079
Straw to be replaced at 1 0-day
intervals, the old straw burned.

868
01:43:36,079 --> 01:43:40,080
If fresh straw is unavailable,
old straw will be turned. "

869
01:43:41,080 --> 01:43:43,081
This is disinfectant. Use it.

870
01:43:45,082 --> 01:43:48,083
-"We have a unit of Voluntary Labor. "
-Liar.

871
01:43:53,085 --> 01:43:56,086
"You're required by the
Military Committee to assist them.

872
01:43:56,086 --> 01:44:01,088
One car is occupied by sailors of
the heroic Kronstadt Sailors' Soviet. "

873
01:44:02,088 --> 01:44:05,089
-So you'll be in good hands.
-They're idiots.

874
01:44:06,089 --> 01:44:11,091
"In approximately 1 1 days' time, you'll
pass through the Urals Province. . .

875
01:44:11,091 --> 01:44:15,093
. . .where White Guards,
aided by foreign interventionists. . .

876
01:44:15,093 --> 01:44:18,094
. . .and other criminal reactionary
elements have been active.

877
01:44:19,094 --> 01:44:21,095
The Military Committee assures you. . .

878
01:44:21,095 --> 01:44:25,096
. . .the criminals have been routed
in that area by Red Guard units. . .

879
01:44:25,096 --> 01:44:29,098
. . .under the command of
People's Commander Strelnikov. "

880
01:44:30,098 --> 01:44:33,099
There's a man. Clap him.

881
01:44:34,100 --> 01:44:38,101
"The line is definitely clear.
Long live the Revolution. "

882
01:44:38,101 --> 01:44:41,102
Long live anarchy! Lickspittle!

883
01:44:41,102 --> 01:44:43,103
Bureaucrat!

884
01:44:51,106 --> 01:44:53,106
Is that necessary?

885
01:44:54,107 --> 01:44:58,108
Six volunteers I've signed for,
and six I'll deliver.

886
01:44:59,109 --> 01:45:02,110
I'm a free man, lickspittle.

887
01:45:02,110 --> 01:45:05,111
There's nothing you can do about it.

888
01:45:10,113 --> 01:45:13,114
I'm the only free man on this train.

889
01:45:14,114 --> 01:45:16,115
The rest of you are cattle!

890
01:50:15,223 --> 01:50:18,224
Help me, for the love of God!

891
01:50:33,229 --> 01:50:34,230
Come on!

892
01:50:53,236 --> 01:50:56,238
Yuri, the child is dead.

893
01:51:05,241 --> 01:51:10,243
It wasn't my child, dear,
and his little soul's in heaven now.

894
01:51:11,243 --> 01:51:15,244
-Who did it, comrade, the Whites?
-The Whites?

895
01:51:17,245 --> 01:51:19,246
No. Strelnikov.

896
01:51:20,246 --> 01:51:23,247
Well, then, you must have
done something.

897
01:51:23,247 --> 01:51:28,249
It wasn't us. The commander said
we'd sold horses to the Whites.

898
01:51:28,249 --> 01:51:32,251
It was those pigs in Kuniko.
We told him, but he didn't believe us.

899
01:51:32,251 --> 01:51:35,252
-You were lying.
-As God's my witness--

900
01:51:35,252 --> 01:51:36,252
But he isn't.

901
01:51:38,253 --> 01:51:40,253
Commander Strelnikov is a great man.

902
01:51:42,254 --> 01:51:45,255
A commander, Sasha,
and he lives on bread and water.

903
01:51:45,255 --> 01:51:49,257
-Does he?
-I don't know. They say so.

904
01:51:49,257 --> 01:51:52,258
It's true. No one knows
where he comes from.

905
01:51:52,258 --> 01:51:56,259
-And they never know where he is.
-He's back up the line.

906
01:51:56,259 --> 01:51:57,260
Yes?

907
01:51:58,260 --> 01:52:02,261
Now, someone's for it, eh?

908
01:52:03,262 --> 01:52:06,263
Oh, really! Not again.

909
01:52:06,263 --> 01:52:08,264
What this time?

910
01:52:17,267 --> 01:52:21,268
Never mind, Father.
Get a good night's sleep.

911
01:52:25,270 --> 01:52:27,270
I know what I'm going to do.

912
01:52:49,278 --> 01:52:50,279
Look!

913
01:52:51,279 --> 01:52:52,279
The Urals.

914
01:52:54,280 --> 01:52:57,281
Look, Sasha!
That's where we're going, darling.

915
01:52:57,281 --> 01:52:59,282
Through the mountains
and into the forest.

916
01:53:00,282 --> 01:53:02,283
Then keeping much warmer still.

917
01:53:03,283 --> 01:53:06,284
Will there be wolves in the forest?

918
01:53:29,293 --> 01:53:31,293
Strelnikov!

919
01:53:36,295 --> 01:53:38,296
Yes.

920
01:53:38,296 --> 01:53:40,297
That's Strelnikov.

921
01:58:22,290 --> 01:58:23,591
Daddy?

922
01:58:26,091 --> 01:58:28,392
What's that noise?

923
01:58:28,891 --> 01:58:30,391
It's only a waterfall.

924
01:58:30,691 --> 01:58:33,191
No, the other noise.

925
01:58:36,092 --> 01:58:37,992
Guns, Sasha.

926
01:58:38,192 --> 01:58:40,993
-Are they fighting?
-They must be.

927
01:58:41,193 --> 01:58:42,793
It's a long way away.

928
01:58:43,093 --> 01:58:44,794
Let's go to sleep.

929
01:59:33,199 --> 01:59:34,199
Get him!

930
01:59:34,500 --> 01:59:35,500
No!

931
01:59:40,001 --> 01:59:41,000
Look.

932
01:59:48,902 --> 01:59:50,901
-Is that all?
-That's all.

933
01:59:59,403 --> 02:00:00,403
Bring him.

934
02:00:12,704 --> 02:00:14,105
Who sent you here?

935
02:00:14,904 --> 02:00:17,005
No one sent me here,
commander.

936
02:00:17,205 --> 02:00:20,605
I'm with my wife and child.
They're on the train from Moscow.

937
02:00:20,905 --> 02:00:23,605
-Yes, we've checked that.
-Then?

938
02:00:23,805 --> 02:00:27,206
You put your knife with a fork
and a spoon and it looks innocuous.

939
02:00:27,506 --> 02:00:31,207
Perhaps you travel with a wife
and child for the same reason.

940
02:00:34,307 --> 02:00:37,907
Yuryatin is occupied by White Guards.
Is that why you're going there?

941
02:00:38,408 --> 02:00:41,108
No, we're going on to Varykino.

942
02:00:41,308 --> 02:00:43,608
Not through Yuryatin.
It's under shellfire.

943
02:00:44,308 --> 02:00:47,009
Commander,
I'm not a White Agent.

944
02:00:47,809 --> 02:00:49,509
No, I don't think you are.

945
02:00:49,809 --> 02:00:52,410
All right, Kolya. Thank you.
Sit down, doctor.

946
02:00:52,709 --> 02:00:54,109
Take it.

947
02:00:55,210 --> 02:00:59,210
It's not as silly as it seems.
There have been one or two attempts.

948
02:01:04,111 --> 02:01:06,011
Are you the poet?

949
02:01:06,311 --> 02:01:07,411
Yes.

950
02:01:07,711 --> 02:01:10,511
-I used to admire your poetry.
-Thank you.

951
02:01:10,811 --> 02:01:12,012
I shouldn't now.

952
02:01:12,912 --> 02:01:16,412
I should find it absurdly personal,
don't you agree?

953
02:01:16,712 --> 02:01:20,713
Feelings, insights, affections.
It's suddenly trivial now.

954
02:01:21,513 --> 02:01:23,613
You don't agree.
You're wrong.

955
02:01:23,813 --> 02:01:28,114
The personal life is dead in Russia.
History has killed it.

956
02:01:29,714 --> 02:01:32,214
I can see how you might hate me.

957
02:01:33,214 --> 02:01:36,915
I hate everything you say,
but not enough to kill you for it.

958
02:01:39,115 --> 02:01:40,415
You have a brother.

959
02:01:40,715 --> 02:01:43,415
-Yevgraf?
-Yevgraf, yes. The policeman.

960
02:01:43,815 --> 02:01:47,016
-I didn't know that.
-Perhaps not. A secret policeman.

961
02:01:47,216 --> 02:01:49,416
-Did he send you here?
-Yevgraf?

962
02:01:49,616 --> 02:01:51,417
No, Yevgraf's a Bolshevik.

963
02:01:55,617 --> 02:01:58,417
I don't know anything
about these things.

964
02:01:58,618 --> 02:02:01,117
Oh, you know a great deal.

965
02:02:01,318 --> 02:02:04,319
When you came in,
you recognized me. How?

966
02:02:05,218 --> 02:02:07,819
-Has someone shown you photographs?
-No.

967
02:02:08,319 --> 02:02:10,619
I am certain you recognized me.

968
02:02:13,019 --> 02:02:14,519
I've seen you before.

969
02:02:15,920 --> 02:02:16,920
When?

970
02:02:17,120 --> 02:02:19,720
-Six years ago.
-Go on.

971
02:02:20,620 --> 02:02:22,120
Christmas Eve, you--

972
02:02:23,320 --> 02:02:24,821
You were there?

973
02:02:25,121 --> 02:02:26,621
Or has someone told you this?

974
02:02:27,621 --> 02:02:30,221
I attended to the man who was injured
by your wife.

975
02:02:31,421 --> 02:02:32,922
Why do you call her my wife?

976
02:02:34,522 --> 02:02:38,622
I met her again. We served together
on the Ukrainian front.

977
02:02:38,922 --> 02:02:40,723
I'm sure she'd vouch for me.

978
02:02:41,923 --> 02:02:44,223
I haven't seen her since the war.

979
02:02:45,023 --> 02:02:46,024
She's in Yuryatin.

980
02:02:49,324 --> 02:02:50,524
Yuryatin?

981
02:02:52,124 --> 02:02:54,225
The private life is dead...

982
02:02:54,825 --> 02:02:57,125
...for a man with any manhood.

983
02:02:57,925 --> 02:03:00,925
We saw a sample of your manhood
on the way, at Mink.

984
02:03:01,125 --> 02:03:04,025
-They sold horses to the Whites.
-No.

985
02:03:04,425 --> 02:03:07,827
-It seems you burnt the wrong village.
-They always say that, does it matter?

986
02:03:08,026 --> 02:03:10,426
A village betrays us, one is burnt.
Point made.

987
02:03:11,027 --> 02:03:12,526
Your point, their village.

988
02:03:13,327 --> 02:03:14,427
Kolya!

989
02:03:20,727 --> 02:03:23,628
What will you do with your wife
and child in Varykino?

990
02:03:23,928 --> 02:03:25,628
Just live.

991
02:03:26,728 --> 02:03:29,428
Take him away.
He's innocent.

992
02:03:39,730 --> 02:03:40,730
You're lucky.

993
02:04:13,834 --> 02:04:16,234
We were diverted.
Do you know where to?

994
02:04:16,534 --> 02:04:18,235
Varykino Halt.

995
02:04:31,737 --> 02:04:32,836
Hello?

996
02:04:41,537 --> 02:04:43,038
How lovely.

997
02:04:47,539 --> 02:04:49,439
Oh, how lovely!

998
02:04:51,339 --> 02:04:52,839
Hello?

999
02:05:00,240 --> 02:05:03,640
-Alexander Maximovich?
-Yes.

1000
02:05:04,040 --> 02:05:05,241
It's me, Petya.

1001
02:05:07,341 --> 02:05:08,841
-Your Honor.
-Now, now, now.

1002
02:05:09,141 --> 02:05:11,041
That's all done with,
you know.

1003
02:05:12,942 --> 02:05:14,841
How do we get
to the house, Petya?

1004
02:05:15,542 --> 02:05:16,942
As you always did.

1005
02:05:38,245 --> 02:05:39,445
Look, Sasha.

1006
02:05:44,146 --> 02:05:46,946
What is it, Petya?
Forest fire?

1007
02:05:47,246 --> 02:05:50,246
Forest fire, Your Honor?
That's Yuryatin.

1008
02:05:51,647 --> 02:05:54,447
Poor souls. First the Reds,
then the Whites.

1009
02:05:54,747 --> 02:05:56,547
Now the Reds again.

1010
02:05:56,848 --> 02:06:00,248
That Strelnikov,
his heart must be dead.

1011
02:06:01,547 --> 02:06:02,548
Go on.

1012
02:06:03,448 --> 02:06:04,948
We'll soon be there, Sasha.

1013
02:06:05,149 --> 02:06:06,548
Another five miles.

1014
02:06:06,748 --> 02:06:10,448
Is it that far? One forgets.
How is the place?

1015
02:06:10,649 --> 02:06:15,149
Well enough, Your Honor.
It's all locked up, you know?

1016
02:06:31,751 --> 02:06:33,252
Varykino.

1017
02:07:22,558 --> 02:07:24,858
All locked up, you see.

1018
02:07:30,758 --> 02:07:32,959
A body, styling itself...

1019
02:07:33,259 --> 02:07:36,359
...the "Yuryatin Committee
of Revolutionary Justice"...

1020
02:07:36,660 --> 02:07:40,060
...has expropriated my house
in the name of the people.

1021
02:07:40,960 --> 02:07:41,961
Very well.

1022
02:07:42,561 --> 02:07:45,461
I'm one of the people too!

1023
02:07:47,061 --> 02:07:50,161
Don't, Your Honor!
They'd call it counterrevolution.

1024
02:07:50,462 --> 02:07:55,562
Father, don't. Petya brought us here,
making him a counterrevolutionary.

1025
02:07:55,862 --> 02:07:58,462
They shoot counterrevolutionaries.

1026
02:08:10,464 --> 02:08:13,464
It's not the Reds in the town,
but in the forest.

1027
02:08:13,664 --> 02:08:15,265
-Partisans.
-Here?

1028
02:08:15,565 --> 02:08:18,565
Who knows? They go where they want
and do what they want.

1029
02:08:18,765 --> 02:08:20,265
All we need is a roof.

1030
02:08:20,565 --> 02:08:22,265
And a bit of garden.

1031
02:08:22,465 --> 02:08:24,266
Is there nowhere?

1032
02:08:28,166 --> 02:08:29,866
They didn't lock the cottage.

1033
02:08:40,067 --> 02:08:42,467
Oh, yes, we can manage here.

1034
02:08:45,969 --> 02:08:47,868
The stove works.

1035
02:08:48,569 --> 02:08:52,669
-I'll find a few sticks of furniture.
-And some seed potatoes?

1036
02:08:53,169 --> 02:08:56,469
I'm afraid the garden is
dreadfully run back.

1037
02:09:06,271 --> 02:09:07,670
Yes, thank you.

1038
02:09:36,075 --> 02:09:37,474
Well done, my boy.

1039
02:09:37,674 --> 02:09:40,475
Scratch a Russian
and you'll find a peasant.

1040
02:09:40,675 --> 02:09:41,975
I've always said so.

1041
02:09:42,175 --> 02:09:46,175
Well, you're wrong. He works like
a peasant but he isn't a peasant.

1042
02:09:46,375 --> 02:09:48,476
I don't mind, Tonya, really.

1043
02:09:48,776 --> 02:09:50,676
-It's a good life.
-Certainly is.

1044
02:09:50,976 --> 02:09:55,477
I wouldn't be surprised if you looked
back on this time as one of your best.

1045
02:09:56,377 --> 02:09:59,677
Awfully glad about the expected
new arrival, Yuri.

1046
02:09:59,977 --> 02:10:02,078
Anna was born here,
you know.

1047
02:10:02,378 --> 02:10:06,079
No, I didn't know that.
Oh, I'm terribly glad.

1048
02:10:06,579 --> 02:10:08,278
Here's winged Mercury.

1049
02:10:10,579 --> 02:10:12,579
Looks a bit down in the mouth.

1050
02:10:14,580 --> 02:10:15,579
Petya.

1051
02:10:16,179 --> 02:10:17,680
What news from Yuryatin?

1052
02:10:17,980 --> 02:10:21,580
No lard, no sugar.
Oil next week, perhaps.

1053
02:10:21,880 --> 02:10:24,680
Flour, salt, coffee...

1054
02:10:24,880 --> 02:10:25,981
...and nails.

1055
02:10:30,181 --> 02:10:31,982
Bad news?

1056
02:10:32,181 --> 02:10:35,782
-Oh, Lord, not another purge.
-No.

1057
02:10:36,082 --> 02:10:39,182
-Strelnikov's gone.
-Well, that's not bad news.

1058
02:10:39,483 --> 02:10:43,283
No, he's in Manchuria, they say.

1059
02:10:47,183 --> 02:10:48,484
That's the news.

1060
02:11:08,786 --> 02:11:10,486
They've shot the Tsar.

1061
02:11:12,787 --> 02:11:14,287
And all his family.

1062
02:11:17,687 --> 02:11:20,888
Oh, that's a savage deed!

1063
02:11:23,087 --> 02:11:25,088
What's it for?

1064
02:11:27,388 --> 02:11:29,489
It's to show there's no going back.

1065
02:12:39,297 --> 02:12:42,098
Yuri, why don't you go to Yuryatin?

1066
02:12:42,398 --> 02:12:45,898
Yes, why don't you, my boy?
It'd do you good.

1067
02:12:46,799 --> 02:12:48,198
Why?
What's in Yuryatin?

1068
02:12:49,398 --> 02:12:52,999
It isn't Petersburg.
Very decent little library there.

1069
02:12:53,199 --> 02:12:56,199
-If it's still there.
-I wish you would.

1070
02:12:58,400 --> 02:13:00,100
No, I don't think so.

1071
02:13:00,800 --> 02:13:02,700
Anyway, the roads are blocked.

1072
02:15:02,015 --> 02:15:03,715
Zhivago.

1073
02:15:06,816 --> 02:15:08,316
Yes.

1074
02:15:13,517 --> 02:15:15,117
How are you?

1075
02:15:16,417 --> 02:15:18,117
What are you doing here?

1076
02:15:18,417 --> 02:15:19,917
We're at Varykino.

1077
02:15:21,717 --> 02:15:23,318
Varykino?

1078
02:15:29,318 --> 02:15:30,919
Why Varykino?

1079
02:15:31,219 --> 02:15:33,219
Why not?
We had to go somewhere.

1080
02:15:33,519 --> 02:15:35,519
But here?

1081
02:15:36,020 --> 02:15:39,220
I came to find my husband.
The one reported killed.

1082
02:15:39,420 --> 02:15:40,820
Strelnikov.

1083
02:15:41,020 --> 02:15:42,120
I met him.

1084
02:15:43,120 --> 02:15:45,320
-Met him?
-Yes.

1085
02:17:14,731 --> 02:17:16,832
How long have you been living here?

1086
02:17:17,932 --> 02:17:19,332
About a year.

1087
02:17:23,933 --> 02:17:26,333
-Alone?
-With Katya.

1088
02:17:27,133 --> 02:17:30,534
-Where is Katya now?
-At school.

1089
02:18:18,639 --> 02:18:20,340
Is Tonya with you?

1090
02:18:21,340 --> 02:18:22,740
All of us.

1091
02:18:23,140 --> 02:18:25,541
-Sasha?
-Of course.

1092
02:18:30,242 --> 02:18:34,541
-What are we going to do?
-I don't know.

1093
02:19:45,751 --> 02:19:46,750
Yuri?

1094
02:19:48,351 --> 02:19:50,751
It's awfully early, isn't it?

1095
02:19:51,051 --> 02:19:52,651
Half past 6.

1096
02:19:52,951 --> 02:19:54,152
What're you doing?

1097
02:19:55,051 --> 02:19:57,252
Nothing. Couldn't sleep.

1098
02:19:57,452 --> 02:20:00,552
-Is anything the matter?
-No.

1099
02:20:05,053 --> 02:20:06,953
Shall I get some tea?

1100
02:20:08,753 --> 02:20:10,354
Yes, do.

1101
02:21:27,964 --> 02:21:30,564
Hello. You are silly.
We called and called.

1102
02:21:30,864 --> 02:21:33,564
-Did you? I didn't hear.
-Well, we did.

1103
02:21:35,865 --> 02:21:37,964
-Hello, Lara.
-Hello.

1104
02:21:40,065 --> 02:21:43,565
-How's Olya Petrovna?
-She gets worse and worse.

1105
02:21:44,066 --> 02:21:46,565
She gave us C.I. and arithmetic
all morning.

1106
02:21:46,866 --> 02:21:49,566
-C.I.?
-Civic Instruction.

1107
02:21:50,066 --> 02:21:50,966
Look.

1108
02:21:53,566 --> 02:21:55,967
-That's very good, Katya.
-Thank you.

1109
02:21:56,367 --> 02:21:57,766
It's the Tsar.

1110
02:21:59,667 --> 02:22:02,167
The Tsar's an enemy
of the people.

1111
02:22:03,267 --> 02:22:06,168
Well, he didn't know he was
an enemy of the people.

1112
02:22:06,368 --> 02:22:08,468
Well, he should've known,
shouldn't he?

1113
02:22:08,668 --> 02:22:10,368
Yes, he should.

1114
02:22:10,668 --> 02:22:14,269
Fancy not knowing C.I. Doesn't
your little boy go to school?

1115
02:22:14,469 --> 02:22:15,769
Lunch.

1116
02:22:16,169 --> 02:22:17,370
Good.

1117
02:22:17,870 --> 02:22:19,569
Come on, you.

1118
02:22:49,373 --> 02:22:50,373
Smell.

1119
02:22:52,174 --> 02:22:53,173
What?

1120
02:22:55,374 --> 02:22:57,374
This one's a prizefighter.

1121
02:22:57,874 --> 02:22:58,875
Yuri.

1122
02:23:01,075 --> 02:23:02,375
Wait a minute.

1123
02:23:03,375 --> 02:23:04,376
There.

1124
02:23:22,477 --> 02:23:25,478
-I'm going into Yuryatin, darling.
-What, now?

1125
02:23:25,778 --> 02:23:28,778
Yes, I want to get some morphine,
disinfectant.

1126
02:23:29,078 --> 02:23:31,678
-I shan't need morphine.
-You never know.

1127
02:23:31,978 --> 02:23:33,379
I shan't need it today.

1128
02:23:33,679 --> 02:23:36,379
No, but it's pretty close.
I hadn't realized.

1129
02:23:38,480 --> 02:23:40,980
-You'll be back before dark?
-Long before.

1130
02:23:53,881 --> 02:23:56,781
Yes, yes, my darling,
do what's best.

1131
02:23:56,982 --> 02:23:58,582
I am not coming back.

1132
02:23:58,782 --> 02:24:02,583
-I understand.
-But never, Lara!

1133
02:24:03,283 --> 02:24:04,782
You understand?

1134
02:24:06,083 --> 02:24:07,583
Do you believe me?

1135
02:25:07,191 --> 02:25:09,791
Comrade Doctor, I need
a medical officer.

1136
02:25:09,991 --> 02:25:12,391
Sorry, I have a wife and child
in Varykino.

1137
02:25:12,591 --> 02:25:14,592
And a mistress in Yuryatin.

1138
02:25:16,891 --> 02:25:21,392
Comrade Medical Officer, we are Red
Partisans. And we shoot deserters.

1139
02:26:08,898 --> 02:26:11,598
-Where are you taking me?
-To the front.

1140
02:26:12,098 --> 02:26:14,899
-And where is the front?
-Good question, doctor.

1141
02:26:15,199 --> 02:26:17,399
It's where there are
enemies of the Revolution.

1142
02:26:17,699 --> 02:26:22,300
Wherever there is one gang of White
Guards or foreign interventionists.

1143
02:26:22,500 --> 02:26:25,700
Where there's a resentful bourgeois,
an unreliable schoolmaster...

1144
02:26:26,000 --> 02:26:28,600
...one dubious poet hugging
his private life.

1145
02:26:28,800 --> 02:26:31,001
That too is the front.

1146
02:26:32,102 --> 02:26:35,502
-How long will you keep me?
-For as long as we need you.

1147
02:27:23,707 --> 02:27:24,808
Now!

1148
02:27:33,609 --> 02:27:34,809
Charge!

1149
02:28:29,616 --> 02:28:31,016
Well, that was easy.

1150
02:28:31,416 --> 02:28:33,716
Come on, doctor, let's see
what we've done.

1151
02:29:17,222 --> 02:29:20,022
St. Michael's Military School.

1152
02:29:25,323 --> 02:29:28,223
You old bastard!

1153
02:29:38,525 --> 02:29:39,924
It doesn't matter.

1154
02:29:43,725 --> 02:29:46,126
Did you ever love a woman, Razin?

1155
02:29:46,426 --> 02:29:48,525
I once had a wife and four children.

1156
02:30:01,427 --> 02:30:04,128
-He has been a good comrade.
-And a good medic.

1157
02:30:04,327 --> 02:30:07,428
We took him from his wife
and from his child.

1158
02:30:07,628 --> 02:30:09,428
None of this matters.

1159
02:30:10,228 --> 02:30:14,029
What does matter, Comrade Commissar?
Tell me, I've forgotten.

1160
02:30:14,329 --> 02:30:17,529
-This is contemptible. He stays.
-I command this unit!

1161
02:30:17,729 --> 02:30:21,229
We command jointly.
The Party bulletin expressly states--

1162
02:30:23,330 --> 02:30:26,230
I could have you taken out and shot.

1163
02:30:26,530 --> 02:30:29,131
And could you have the Party
taken out and shot?

1164
02:30:29,431 --> 02:30:34,331
As the military struggle nears its
close, the political one intensifies.

1165
02:30:34,931 --> 02:30:37,432
In victory, the military
will have served its purpose.

1166
02:30:37,632 --> 02:30:40,232
All men will then be judged
politically...

1167
02:30:40,632 --> 02:30:43,432
...regardless of their
military record.

1168
02:30:45,033 --> 02:30:49,233
Meanwhile, there are still White Units
in this area. The doctor stays.

1169
02:30:49,433 --> 02:30:51,833
That concludes the meeting.

1170
02:31:41,539 --> 02:31:43,840
Comrade, where are you going?

1171
02:31:44,040 --> 02:31:46,740
Are you running away, comrade?

1172
02:31:47,340 --> 02:31:50,340
-Soldiers.
-Red soldiers or White soldiers?

1173
02:31:50,540 --> 02:31:52,241
Soldiers.

1174
02:33:36,654 --> 02:33:37,854
Tonya?

1175
02:33:38,855 --> 02:33:41,655
Tonya! Sasha!

1176
02:33:44,155 --> 02:33:45,455
Tonya!

1177
02:34:47,563 --> 02:34:51,264
-This is Yuryatin?
-Yes, Yuryatin.

1178
02:34:51,864 --> 02:34:53,464
What's happened at Varykino?

1179
02:34:53,764 --> 02:34:56,464
-Moscow folks?
-Yes.

1180
02:34:56,764 --> 02:35:01,064
They've gone away. Gone away.
There's nobody at Varykino.

1181
02:35:51,071 --> 02:35:54,271
<i>Lord, what happiness!
They say you're alive.</i>

1182
02:35:54,572 --> 02:35:56,471
<i>Someone saw you near the town.</i>

1183
02:35:56,671 --> 02:36:00,372
<i>I take it you've gone to Varykino,
so I'm going there myself with Katya.</i>

1184
02:36:00,572 --> 02:36:03,972
<i>Just in case, I've left a little food.
Boiled potatoes mostly.</i>

1185
02:36:04,172 --> 02:36:06,873
<i>Put the lid back on the pan
or the rats will get it.</i>

1186
02:36:07,173 --> 02:36:10,273
<i>I'm mad with joy!</i>

1187
02:37:22,482 --> 02:37:23,483
Tonya.

1188
02:37:25,182 --> 02:37:26,683
<i>Tonya!</i>

1189
02:37:27,183 --> 02:37:28,983
<i>-Yuri.
-Tonya!</i>

1190
02:37:29,283 --> 02:37:30,983
<i>-Yuri.
-Tonya.</i>

1191
02:37:31,183 --> 02:37:33,283
<i>Yuri, darling.</i>

1192
02:37:46,785 --> 02:37:48,886
It's all right, Yuri.

1193
02:37:49,186 --> 02:37:52,086
They're safe. They're in Moscow.

1194
02:37:52,286 --> 02:37:54,286
-In Moscow?
-Yes.

1195
02:37:54,686 --> 02:37:58,186
-Tonya?
-All of them. They're safe.

1196
02:37:59,387 --> 02:38:00,687
Safe.

1197
02:38:03,087 --> 02:38:04,888
Firing squads!

1198
02:38:41,392 --> 02:38:42,492
Better.

1199
02:38:51,093 --> 02:38:52,294
What?

1200
02:38:53,593 --> 02:38:55,694
I've got a letter for you.

1201
02:38:55,894 --> 02:38:57,694
I've had it three months.

1202
02:38:59,694 --> 02:39:02,094
And it was three months getting here.

1203
02:39:02,394 --> 02:39:03,895
It's from Moscow.

1204
02:39:05,995 --> 02:39:07,695
I think it's from Tonya.

1205
02:39:07,995 --> 02:39:10,495
It's addressed to you, care of me.

1206
02:39:12,396 --> 02:39:16,296
She came into Yuryatin to find you
when you vanished.

1207
02:39:16,597 --> 02:39:18,397
Someone sent her here.

1208
02:39:18,696 --> 02:39:20,097
You met?

1209
02:39:22,797 --> 02:39:24,697
She's very fine.

1210
02:39:34,399 --> 02:39:36,199
<i>My dearest dear.</i>

1211
02:39:36,499 --> 02:39:39,100
<i>I'm sending this
to Larissa Antipova's...</i>

1212
02:39:39,300 --> 02:39:42,200
<i>...because if you are alive,
which God grant...</i>

1213
02:39:42,500 --> 02:39:44,900
<i>...I think that is where you will go.</i>

1214
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:48,600
<i>We have a little daughter, Yuri.
Did you know?</i>

1215
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:50,501
<i>Her name's Anna.</i>

1216
02:39:50,701 --> 02:39:52,601
<i>Father sends greetings.</i>

1217
02:39:52,901 --> 02:39:56,701
<i>Sasha has grown quite a lot.
He's quite big now.</i>

1218
02:39:57,401 --> 02:40:01,602
<i>Whenever we speak of you, he weeps
and won't be comforted.</i>

1219
02:40:01,902 --> 02:40:03,502
<i>This is what I have to tell you:</i>

1220
02:40:03,803 --> 02:40:06,202
<i>We are being deported from Russia.</i>

1221
02:40:06,503 --> 02:40:09,803
<i>We can't make out
if you'd be allowed to join us.</i>

1222
02:40:10,003 --> 02:40:13,903
<i>An organization in Paris, which I
mustn't name, will know where we are.</i>

1223
02:40:14,203 --> 02:40:16,704
<i>Nothing is certain,
and there's little time.</i>

1224
02:40:17,004 --> 02:40:18,904
<i>I'm writing this in haste.</i>

1225
02:40:19,204 --> 02:40:22,804
<i>They're coming for us now.
God bless you.</i>

1226
02:40:23,605 --> 02:40:27,505
<i>I must honestly admit
that Antipova is a good person.</i>

1227
02:40:37,507 --> 02:40:41,707
Yuri, when they got away to Moscow,
she left something here.

1228
02:41:16,212 --> 02:41:17,711
Yuri?

1229
02:41:41,915 --> 02:41:43,314
May I come in?

1230
02:41:45,415 --> 02:41:48,315
Yuri Andreyevich, you've changed,
I think.

1231
02:41:49,416 --> 02:41:51,916
Oh, yes, decidedly.

1232
02:41:52,816 --> 02:41:54,116
Larissa...

1233
02:41:55,816 --> 02:41:57,717
...remarkably the same.

1234
02:42:04,717 --> 02:42:06,518
I came from Moscow.

1235
02:42:07,418 --> 02:42:09,518
I'm on the way to Vladivostok.

1236
02:42:16,819 --> 02:42:18,319
I'm here to offer you my help.

1237
02:42:18,619 --> 02:42:20,020
We don't want it.

1238
02:42:20,220 --> 02:42:22,620
-Speak for yourself.
-We don't want it.

1239
02:42:23,120 --> 02:42:26,620
Yuri Andreyevich, you spent two years
with the Partisan's 5th Division.

1240
02:42:26,820 --> 02:42:29,220
You have no discharge,
so you are a deserter.

1241
02:42:29,520 --> 02:42:33,121
Your family in Paris is involved
in a dangerous migr organization.

1242
02:42:33,321 --> 02:42:36,022
Now all these are technicalities.

1243
02:42:36,322 --> 02:42:37,721
But your style of life...

1244
02:42:37,921 --> 02:42:43,122
...everything you say, your published
writings, are flagrantly subversive.

1245
02:42:43,422 --> 02:42:45,023
Your days are numbered...

1246
02:42:45,623 --> 02:42:47,323
...unless I help you.

1247
02:42:47,523 --> 02:42:51,123
-Do you want my help?
-No.

1248
02:42:52,023 --> 02:42:53,424
Wait, Yuri.

1249
02:42:58,325 --> 02:43:00,124
Larissa, three glasses.

1250
02:43:00,724 --> 02:43:02,225
No.

1251
02:43:02,425 --> 02:43:06,125
Yuri, you must see
how serious this is.

1252
02:43:08,625 --> 02:43:10,526
Please don't underestimate me.

1253
02:43:10,726 --> 02:43:13,726
Practically or morally,
I'm not the man you take me for.

1254
02:43:16,026 --> 02:43:20,326
How do you know all this about Yuri?
How can you help?

1255
02:43:20,627 --> 02:43:22,927
I do and I can.
lsn't that sufficient?

1256
02:43:23,128 --> 02:43:24,327
No.

1257
02:43:37,729 --> 02:43:40,730
Our Eastern Seaboard is
an undeveloped area.

1258
02:43:41,429 --> 02:43:45,730
The commissariat of foreign affairs
wants to form an independent state.

1259
02:43:46,230 --> 02:43:50,831
It affords us a temporary channel of
communication with the outside world.

1260
02:43:51,031 --> 02:43:54,331
I have good contacts in the Far East.

1261
02:43:54,931 --> 02:43:57,432
I've been appointed
the Minister of Justice.

1262
02:43:57,632 --> 02:44:00,432
-The Bolsheviks trust you?
-They trust no one.

1263
02:44:00,632 --> 02:44:02,332
They found me useful.

1264
02:44:07,232 --> 02:44:09,133
Here's how I can help you.

1265
02:44:09,833 --> 02:44:13,734
You come with me as far
as the Pacific Coast.

1266
02:44:13,934 --> 02:44:15,733
From there you can go
where you like.

1267
02:44:17,034 --> 02:44:19,134
To Paris, or not.

1268
02:44:20,434 --> 02:44:21,835
I think you'd better go.

1269
02:44:22,635 --> 02:44:27,336
Your rarefied selfishness
is intolerable.

1270
02:44:27,635 --> 02:44:29,335
Larissa's in danger too.

1271
02:44:30,036 --> 02:44:32,135
-By association with me?
-No.

1272
02:44:32,436 --> 02:44:35,437
Not by association with you.
You're a small fry.

1273
02:44:35,637 --> 02:44:37,937
By association with Strelnikov.

1274
02:44:38,337 --> 02:44:42,437
-I never met Strelnikov.
-You're married to him, they know that.

1275
02:44:42,637 --> 02:44:46,438
-I was married to Pasha Antipov.
-I understand, I understand.

1276
02:44:46,738 --> 02:44:48,338
But they don't.

1277
02:44:48,637 --> 02:44:50,738
You're being watched.

1278
02:44:51,238 --> 02:44:52,739
Do you know why?

1279
02:44:53,938 --> 02:44:57,539
A husband is a sticky commodity,
my dear.

1280
02:44:58,639 --> 02:44:59,639
Go away.

1281
02:45:02,639 --> 02:45:06,340
More of your high-minded lunacy?

1282
02:45:07,140 --> 02:45:08,841
You have a child to think of!

1283
02:45:09,441 --> 02:45:10,540
Look here.

1284
02:45:12,941 --> 02:45:16,341
-That's sugar for the child.
-I don't want it.

1285
02:45:17,142 --> 02:45:19,542
You would refuse my sugar?

1286
02:45:20,642 --> 02:45:22,243
Who are you to refuse me anything?

1287
02:45:22,742 --> 02:45:24,342
Now you go.

1288
02:45:27,742 --> 02:45:29,143
-I came--
-Go!

1289
02:45:30,243 --> 02:45:31,343
Go!

1290
02:45:32,643 --> 02:45:35,443
I came to you in good faith.

1291
02:45:39,944 --> 02:45:42,745
Stay here then,
and get your desserts!

1292
02:45:45,945 --> 02:45:48,545
Your desserts, do you hear me?

1293
02:45:51,746 --> 02:45:54,246
Do you think you're immaculate?

1294
02:45:57,646 --> 02:45:59,547
You're not immaculate!

1295
02:46:01,447 --> 02:46:03,347
I know you!

1296
02:46:04,548 --> 02:46:06,247
Do you hear me?

1297
02:46:06,748 --> 02:46:11,948
We're all made of the same clay,
you know!

1298
02:46:12,849 --> 02:46:14,648
Clay!

1299
02:46:15,349 --> 02:46:17,249
Clay!

1300
02:46:21,849 --> 02:46:22,949
Lara?

1301
02:46:25,850 --> 02:46:27,650
He's rubbish, Lara.

1302
02:46:28,650 --> 02:46:30,650
Yes. Rubbish.

1303
02:46:32,751 --> 02:46:35,051
I wish he'd never happened.

1304
02:46:35,451 --> 02:46:37,052
Does it matter?

1305
02:46:37,452 --> 02:46:38,751
Doesn't it?

1306
02:46:39,251 --> 02:46:40,652
Not to me.

1307
02:46:49,653 --> 02:46:52,353
What shall we do?
Can we get on a train?

1308
02:46:52,653 --> 02:46:55,054
No, they'd arrest us on the spot.

1309
02:46:55,254 --> 02:46:59,255
-I don't want to stay here and wait.
-No.

1310
02:47:01,354 --> 02:47:02,455
Listen...

1311
02:47:03,755 --> 02:47:06,655
-...we could go to--
-Varykino.

1312
02:47:08,255 --> 02:47:12,356
-They'd find out sooner or later.
-Yes, but later.

1313
02:47:12,855 --> 02:47:15,656
-If our days are really numbered....
-Yes.

1314
02:47:15,957 --> 02:47:17,656
We'd better live them...

1315
02:47:19,757 --> 02:47:21,857
...before we are parted.

1316
02:47:22,457 --> 02:47:23,457
Yes.

1317
02:48:46,167 --> 02:48:49,468
<i>Father caught a flea!
Ho, ho, ho</i>

1318
02:48:49,767 --> 02:48:52,568
<i>I love the snow
One, two, three</i>

1319
02:49:55,676 --> 02:49:57,876
Anna taught me to write
at this desk.

1320
02:53:44,605 --> 02:53:46,705
This isn't me, Yuri.

1321
02:53:47,305 --> 02:53:50,505
-Yes, it is.
-No.

1322
02:53:51,605 --> 02:53:53,006
It's you.

1323
02:53:57,707 --> 02:53:59,106
"Lara."

1324
02:54:47,112 --> 02:54:48,313
Yuri!

1325
02:54:49,113 --> 02:54:52,513
-Yuri, there's a wolf howling!
-Oh, yes, I've--

1326
02:54:56,714 --> 02:54:59,814
I've seen them. They're frightened.
They won't harm us.

1327
02:55:00,114 --> 02:55:02,314
Yes, I know.

1328
02:55:03,114 --> 02:55:05,315
I'm sorry. It's--

1329
02:55:13,116 --> 02:55:16,216
Oh, Lord, this is an awful time
to be alive!

1330
02:55:16,516 --> 02:55:19,016
-No.
-It is. It is!

1331
02:55:19,216 --> 02:55:20,717
No, no.

1332
02:56:22,724 --> 02:56:25,325
Wouldn't it have been lovely
if we'd met before?

1333
02:56:25,525 --> 02:56:28,225
Before we did? Yes.

1334
02:56:31,225 --> 02:56:33,926
We'd have got married,
had a house and children.

1335
02:56:37,026 --> 02:56:41,027
If we'd had children, Yuri,
would you have liked a boy or a girl?

1336
02:56:42,227 --> 02:56:46,227
I think we may go mad
if we think about all that.

1337
02:56:46,828 --> 02:56:48,827
I shall always think about it.

1338
02:56:50,028 --> 02:56:52,728
-Will you write today?
-No, not today.

1339
02:57:12,031 --> 02:57:13,231
Katya!

1340
02:57:13,930 --> 02:57:15,331
Come to me, darling.

1341
02:57:27,832 --> 02:57:29,033
Victor!

1342
02:57:30,332 --> 02:57:31,633
We thought it was....

1343
02:57:33,333 --> 02:57:34,533
Quite.

1344
02:57:36,534 --> 02:57:38,234
I wonder if you'd mind, comrades?

1345
02:57:43,234 --> 02:57:45,635
My government has a train,
standing in Yuryatin.

1346
02:57:45,935 --> 02:57:48,635
There's a carriage for me
and my assistants.

1347
02:57:48,835 --> 02:57:51,635
You will travel in comfort and safety.

1348
02:57:51,835 --> 02:57:53,536
I'm not going with you.

1349
02:57:53,836 --> 02:57:57,136
I'm not going without you.
So there's an end to it.

1350
02:57:57,436 --> 02:58:00,536
Then I'll have to speak
to Yuri Andreyevich in private.

1351
02:58:15,439 --> 02:58:17,338
Strelnikov is dead.

1352
02:58:17,638 --> 02:58:20,539
-What?
-Spare me your expressions of regret.

1353
02:58:20,840 --> 02:58:24,140
He was a murderous neurotic,
and no loss to anyone.

1354
02:58:25,140 --> 02:58:27,140
Do you see how this affects Larissa?

1355
02:58:27,440 --> 02:58:29,241
You don't?

1356
02:58:29,540 --> 02:58:31,340
You're a fool.

1357
02:58:35,341 --> 02:58:36,941
She's Strelnikov's wife.

1358
02:58:37,141 --> 02:58:39,641
Why do you think
they haven't arrested her?

1359
02:58:39,941 --> 02:58:44,342
Why do you think they had her watched?
They were waiting for Strelnikov.

1360
02:58:44,842 --> 02:58:48,643
If they thought he'd come running
to his wife, they didn't know him.

1361
02:58:48,943 --> 02:58:53,043
They knew him well enough.
They caught him five miles from here.

1362
02:58:53,343 --> 02:58:56,243
He was arrested on the road.
He didn't conceal himself.

1363
02:58:56,543 --> 02:58:57,944
Throughout the interview...

1364
02:58:58,244 --> 02:59:00,544
...he insisted they call him
Pavel Antipov...

1365
02:59:00,744 --> 02:59:03,045
...and refused to answer
to "Strelnikov."

1366
02:59:03,744 --> 02:59:07,544
On his way to execution, he took
a pistol and blew his own brains out.

1367
02:59:08,545 --> 02:59:10,145
Oh, my God!

1368
02:59:11,745 --> 02:59:13,045
Don't tell Lara this.

1369
02:59:13,246 --> 02:59:15,546
I think I know her at least
as well as you.

1370
02:59:15,945 --> 02:59:19,347
But don't you see her position?
She's served her purpose.

1371
02:59:19,547 --> 02:59:24,747
These men who came to escort me today
will come tomorrow as a firing squad.

1372
02:59:25,047 --> 02:59:29,047
Now I know exactly what you think
of me, and why.

1373
02:59:29,247 --> 02:59:32,048
But if you're not coming with me,
she's not coming.

1374
02:59:32,948 --> 02:59:35,148
So are you coming with me?

1375
02:59:35,549 --> 02:59:40,749
Do you accept the protection of this
ignoble Caliban on any terms?

1376
02:59:41,150 --> 02:59:43,349
Is your delicacy so exorbitant...

1377
02:59:43,549 --> 02:59:46,650
...that you'd sacrifice a woman
and a child to it?

1378
02:59:55,951 --> 02:59:58,551
There's some bags to carry,
comrades.

1379
03:00:14,454 --> 03:00:15,553
Get in.

1380
03:00:19,954 --> 03:00:21,154
Come.

1381
03:00:24,954 --> 03:00:25,955
-How many?
-All of us.

1382
03:00:26,355 --> 03:00:29,155
-Sorry, not enough room.
-There's got to be room.

1383
03:00:29,355 --> 03:00:31,456
It's all right.
I'll bring our sledge.

1384
03:00:31,656 --> 03:00:34,356
Hurry. This train has
important people.

1385
03:00:34,556 --> 03:00:36,656
You start. I'll catch you up.

1386
03:00:42,357 --> 03:00:43,557
Right, comrades!

1387
03:00:45,957 --> 03:00:47,558
We'll see you at--

1388
03:00:48,258 --> 03:00:49,457
Hurry!

1389
03:02:21,269 --> 03:02:24,069
I'm afraid that's it.
Your young man's not coming.

1390
03:02:24,970 --> 03:02:26,969
You fool.

1391
03:02:27,270 --> 03:02:29,570
Did you really think
he would come with you?

1392
03:02:38,772 --> 03:02:40,371
The man's an idiot.

1393
03:02:41,972 --> 03:02:45,872
-From Mongolia he could've gone to--
-He'll never leave Russia.

1394
03:02:46,072 --> 03:02:47,972
You've come with me, haven't you?

1395
03:02:49,873 --> 03:02:51,073
Yes.

1396
03:02:52,473 --> 03:02:54,874
To be sure, it was your duty
as a mother.

1397
03:02:55,973 --> 03:02:57,774
That's right, Victor.

1398
03:03:00,273 --> 03:03:02,574
I'm carrying Yuri's child.

1399
03:03:07,675 --> 03:03:11,175
<i>I was born out there.
In the Far East somewhere.</i>

1400
03:03:11,375 --> 03:03:13,475
Maybe Mongolia. I don't remember.

1401
03:03:13,775 --> 03:03:16,376
You were born in Mongolia,
that very year.

1402
03:03:16,676 --> 03:03:18,276
So were a lot of others.

1403
03:03:18,576 --> 03:03:21,876
Not many named Tonya,
bearing the name Komarov.

1404
03:03:22,076 --> 03:03:23,677
Komarov's a common name.

1405
03:03:23,977 --> 03:03:28,778
With fair hair, blue eyes, lost at 8
when war broke out in the Far East?

1406
03:03:28,978 --> 03:03:33,278
There's something you haven't told me.
How did you come to be lost?

1407
03:03:33,478 --> 03:03:36,278
-I can't remember!
-You must remember something!

1408
03:03:36,579 --> 03:03:37,779
No!

1409
03:03:38,978 --> 03:03:41,179
I'll tell you how I first
met your mother.

1410
03:03:41,479 --> 03:03:44,079
-If she was my mother.
-You judge.

1411
03:03:44,379 --> 03:03:47,179
I picked my brother up,
literally, on a Moscow street.

1412
03:03:47,880 --> 03:03:51,080
He had a fourth-class ration book
and was undernourished.

1413
03:03:51,280 --> 03:03:53,881
He didn't seem to mind that
or anything.

1414
03:03:54,081 --> 03:03:56,781
I thought he was a happier man
than me.

1415
03:03:57,781 --> 03:04:00,381
He suffered me to buy him
a new suit...

1416
03:04:00,581 --> 03:04:03,182
...and to get him a job
at his old hospital.

1417
03:04:03,881 --> 03:04:06,182
I saw him off
for his first day's work.

1418
03:04:06,582 --> 03:04:10,883
This was eight years
after he and Lara parted.

1419
03:04:12,383 --> 03:04:13,883
So he never saw her again?

1420
03:04:18,684 --> 03:04:20,984
Thank you. You've been
very kind to me.

1421
03:04:27,985 --> 03:04:29,785
<i>He must've known how ill he was.</i>

1422
03:04:29,985 --> 03:04:32,086
<i>The walls of his heart
were like paper.</i>

1423
03:04:32,286 --> 03:04:33,985
<i>But he kept it to himself.</i>

1424
03:04:34,485 --> 03:04:36,486
<i>He kept a lot to himself.</i>

1425
03:04:59,789 --> 03:05:00,789
Please.

1426
03:06:04,297 --> 03:06:07,897
<i>I was astonished at the extent
of his reputation.</i>

1427
03:06:08,197 --> 03:06:10,198
<i>His work was unobtainable
at the time.</i>

1428
03:06:10,498 --> 03:06:12,898
<i>It was disapproved of by the Party.</i>

1429
03:06:13,198 --> 03:06:16,298
<i>But if people love poetry,
they love poets.</i>

1430
03:06:16,598 --> 03:06:18,599
<i>And nobody loves poetry
like a Russian.</i>

1431
03:06:28,600 --> 03:06:30,200
Excuse me, comrade.

1432
03:06:31,201 --> 03:06:32,600
Are you Yevgraf?

1433
03:06:33,600 --> 03:06:34,901
My name is Lara.

1434
03:06:35,101 --> 03:06:39,902
<i>I knew her name from the Lara poems
I'd found with Yuri's manuscripts.</i>

1435
03:06:40,102 --> 03:06:42,002
I knew your brother.

1436
03:06:43,602 --> 03:06:44,702
I need your help.

1437
03:06:45,402 --> 03:06:48,203
<i>She'd come to Moscow
to look for her child.</i>

1438
03:06:48,403 --> 03:06:50,603
<i>I helped her as far as I could.</i>

1439
03:06:53,903 --> 03:06:55,503
<i>But I knew it was hopeless.</i>

1440
03:07:01,304 --> 03:07:03,604
<i>I think I was a little
in love with her.</i>

1441
03:07:11,905 --> 03:07:14,105
<i>One day she went away
and didn't come back.</i>

1442
03:07:14,805 --> 03:07:17,106
<i>She died or vanished somewhere...</i>

1443
03:07:17,406 --> 03:07:19,406
<i>...in one of the labor camps.</i>

1444
03:07:19,706 --> 03:07:24,107
<i>A nameless number on a list
that was afterwards mislaid.</i>

1445
03:07:24,407 --> 03:07:27,307
<i>That was quite common in those days.</i>

1446
03:07:34,909 --> 03:07:36,008
Tonya.

1447
03:07:36,808 --> 03:07:39,209
How did you come to be lost?

1448
03:07:40,509 --> 03:07:42,509
-We were running in a street.
-We?

1449
03:07:42,709 --> 03:07:44,909
-My father.
-Not your father. Komarovsky.

1450
03:07:45,209 --> 03:07:46,710
I don't know!

1451
03:07:47,010 --> 03:07:48,610
The street was on fire.

1452
03:07:48,810 --> 03:07:52,410
There were explosions
and houses were falling down.

1453
03:07:54,211 --> 03:07:57,011
He let go of my hand!

1454
03:07:57,611 --> 03:08:00,412
He let go of my hand.

1455
03:08:01,211 --> 03:08:03,012
And I was lost.

1456
03:08:05,812 --> 03:08:08,013
Your father would've done that?

1457
03:08:08,213 --> 03:08:11,213
Oh, yes. People will do anything.

1458
03:08:11,413 --> 03:08:13,413
It was Komarovsky.

1459
03:08:16,114 --> 03:08:20,214
This man was your father.

1460
03:08:22,014 --> 03:08:24,014
Why won't you believe it?

1461
03:08:24,915 --> 03:08:26,814
Don't you want to believe it?

1462
03:08:27,615 --> 03:08:29,815
Not if it isn't true.

1463
03:08:32,916 --> 03:08:34,416
That's inherited.

1464
03:08:34,715 --> 03:08:39,016
Comrade General, when I was a child,
I wanted parents.

1465
03:08:39,216 --> 03:08:42,217
You can imagine how I wanted parents.

1466
03:08:43,016 --> 03:08:45,817
I wanted to die when I was a child.

1467
03:08:46,217 --> 03:08:47,217
You know?

1468
03:08:50,118 --> 03:08:52,418
Now I don't know.

1469
03:08:53,618 --> 03:08:56,518
I can't be of any use to them now,
can I?

1470
03:08:57,118 --> 03:08:59,819
I was hoping I might be
of some use to you.

1471
03:09:01,819 --> 03:09:03,920
-Will you think about it?
-Yes.

1472
03:09:10,020 --> 03:09:11,821
It's all right, David.

1473
03:09:15,021 --> 03:09:16,021
You work here?

1474
03:09:16,221 --> 03:09:17,621
Yes, I'm an operator.

1475
03:09:17,921 --> 03:09:21,121
-And what do you operate?
-That.

1476
03:09:36,924 --> 03:09:38,923
You've promised to think about it.

1477
03:09:51,325 --> 03:09:52,525
Tonya!

1478
03:09:54,026 --> 03:09:55,625
Can you play the balalaika?

1479
03:09:55,825 --> 03:09:58,727
Can she play? She's an artist!

1480
03:09:59,027 --> 03:10:01,527
An artist? Who taught you?

1481
03:10:01,727 --> 03:10:02,927
No one taught her.

1482
03:10:05,427 --> 03:10:07,228
Then it's a gift.
