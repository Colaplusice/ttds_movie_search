00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,350
"RIO
BRAVO"

2
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,438
Joe, you're under arrest.

3
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,188
Maybe so, but don't turn around, Sheriff.

4
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,796
Now what are you gonna do, Sheriff?

5
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,549
You can do
just about what you want, Chance.

6
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,236
Anybody else you want besides Joe?

7
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,675
No.

8
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,114
Give me a hand.

9
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,389
What is all this?

10
00:05:49,480 --> 00:05:50,515
Hello, Mr. Wheeler.

11
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,319
Tell your men to stay with the wagons
till they're told different.

12
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:55,834
Who the devil do you think
you're ordering around here?

13
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:59,151
First Burdette's men stop me,
and now you stand there and try...

14
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:01,878
Say, seems like I ought to know you.

15
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,552
Think you do, Mr. Wheeler.

16
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:05,871
Yeah, I remember you now.

17
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:09,278
That star you're wearing kind
of threw me off for a minute.

18
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,397
Aren't you the fella the Mexicans
used to call Brochin?

19
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,389
That's nearly right, only it's Borrachn.

20
00:06:15,480 --> 00:06:18,233
I don't think
I've ever seen you like this before.

21
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,719
You mean sober? You're probably right.

22
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,392
You know what Borrachn means?

23
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:25,357
My Spanish ain't too good.

24
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:26,873
It means drunk.

25
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,317
Now if the name bothers you,
they used to call me Dude.

26
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,075
Now, are you gonna tell your men,
or do I?

27
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,312
I'll tell my men.

28
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,716
Standby the wagons, everybody!

29
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,434
Pass the word.

30
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,516
SHERIFF

31
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,913
Chance, what's going on here?

32
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:17,989
People stopping me.

33
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:20,230
Everybody telling me what I can do
and what I can't do.

34
00:07:20,320 --> 00:07:22,117
Next thing I know you'll be telling me
what to do.

35
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:24,156
- All right, Pat, I will tell you.
- What?

36
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,595
- Stop your wagons.
- I give up.

37
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:34,479
Now, don't tell me what's going on. Just
leave me wandering around in this fog.

38
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,755
I like it. I'm getting used to it.
It makes me feel so good.

39
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:39,798
You better look out, Pat.
You'll blow up and bust.

40
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:43,031
Listen, Chance, remember me,
your old friend Pat Wheeler?

41
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,156
- Now, will you please...
- Hey, Chance!

42
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,630
What do you wanna do about this outfit?
Do you wanna take their guns?

43
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,278
Got any new men with you, Pat?

44
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,555
No, nobody except Colorado here.

45
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,037
- Where'd you take him on?
- Fort Worth.

46
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,189
What does he do?

47
00:07:56,280 --> 00:07:59,238
I speak English, Sheriff,
if you want to ask me.

48
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,110
All right, buster, what do you do?

49
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,274
I'm riding guard.

50
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,511
Pretty young for that, aren't you?

51
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,875
Just how old do you have to be, Sheriff?

52
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:14,756
You remember Ryan from Denver,
don't you?

53
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:15,875
Rocky Ryan?

54
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,559
That's his boy.

55
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,070
He tells me the kid's faster than he was.

56
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,232
He better be, packing a pair of guns.

57
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:27,752
Now, Sheriff, if it's the two guns that
bother you, I could give you one of 'em.

58
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:29,838
I could let you have them both.

59
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,911
They wouldn't do me too much good.

60
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,719
That fellow in the door there
has a shotgun on me.

61
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,758
- Stumpy, didn't I tell...
- I know.

62
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:38,558
I'm going. I'm going.

63
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,956
You can keep your guns, Colorado.

64
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,759
Thanks, Sheriff.
I don't want any trouble.

65
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,553
Well, then don't start any.

66
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,949
I won't, unless I tell you first.

67
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,719
That's good enough.

68
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:55,354
Pat, you can put your wagons
in that corral.

69
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:57,118
I ought to do just that.

70
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,668
- What?
- I'm just guessing, you understand.

71
00:09:00,040 --> 00:09:02,918
It seems to me that you've already got
some trouble around here.

72
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,069
You're guessing right.

73
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:07,914
It so happens that part of my load there
is fuel oil and dynamite.

74
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,355
Would you like to have that sitting
right next to you?

75
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,759
No, I wouldn't.

76
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:14,035
They could put 'em over there
by the creek,

77
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,872
near the Burdette warehouse.

78
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,992
If it's gonna blow,
that's just as good a place as any.

79
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,712
Show 'em the way, Dude.

80
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,472
You can go along, Colorado.

81
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,029
Is that the way you want it, Mr. Wheeler?

82
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,154
Go ahead.

83
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,914
Well?

84
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,389
Let's get out
of the middle of the street.

85
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:52,710
Now that you're satisfied
and that the kid's got his guns,

86
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:56,477
would you mind telling me
what this is all about?

87
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,311
We've got Joe Burdette in here.

88
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,671
Joe Burdette in jail? Nathan's brother?

89
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,909
That's right.

90
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,357
What are you holding him for?

91
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:09,432
They were about to bury the reason
when you were coming in.

92
00:10:09,520 --> 00:10:10,555
Murder?

93
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,073
No other word for it.

94
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,870
No wonder this town's in such a mess.

95
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:17,112
What does Nathan say about this?

96
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:20,317
Nothing. He's not talking. Just doing.

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,674
You saw part of it.

98
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:26,788
He's got this town so bottled up
that I can't get Joe out or any help in.

99
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,710
His men are over there watching us.

100
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,199
There he is.

101
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,233
I can't make a move
without him knowing it.

102
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:36,958
Who you got helping you?

103
00:10:38,080 --> 00:10:39,798
You met half of them.

104
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:43,436
You mean that fellow with the badge
that stopped me? And who else?

105
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,230
Stumpy. You know him.

106
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,915
He's watching Joe and guarding the jail.

107
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:53,430
A game-legged old man and a drunk.
That's all you got?

108
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:55,112
That's what I got.

109
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:00,158
If I ever saw a man holding the bull
by the tail, you're it.

110
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,195
It was a good idea putting my wagons
where they're safe.

111
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,872
Guess I better see they did it.

112
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,639
I'll see you later.

113
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,512
Better get back up there
and watch the road.

114
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,113
You don't look so good.

115
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,719
I feel worse.

116
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,832
Think I'll stop off and get a beer.

117
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,319
I thought you would.

118
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,955
Got some in here. Cold.

119
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,918
Just as long as it's beer.

120
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:42,629
Stumpy, didn't I tell you
to stay out of sight?

121
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,839
There you go. I never can please you.

122
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,759
I was just covering you
in case of trouble.

123
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,434
I'd be in more trouble
if you'd have got picked off

124
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:52,318
- while you were standing at that door.
- You'd be in trouble?

125
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:54,391
What about me
if somebody gunned me down?

126
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,198
Don't you never think of me?

127
00:11:56,760 --> 00:11:59,035
Dude, I guess we better get used to it.

128
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:01,953
Here's a fella don't think of nobody
but himself.

129
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,437
I told you why I want you back in there,
and you're gonna stay there

130
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,829
with that cage locked
while I'm not around.

131
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,433
- You hear me?
- I heard you.

132
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,192
And those windows, did you fix them?

133
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:13,350
Them shutters is nailed up
tighter than a drum.

134
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,998
Nothing could get in here now.

135
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,753
- Not even a breath of fresh air.
- That's the way I want it.

136
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,717
Yeah, but you change my life.
Can't help it.

137
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,519
Five, six days breathing the same air
as a man like Joe Burdette

138
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:24,158
is apt to make a killer out of me.

139
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:26,515
You can hear me back there,
can't you, Joe?

140
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:29,751
I hear you all right, but I won't have
to listen to you for very long.

141
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:32,035
Now, Joe, that's gratitude for you,

142
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:35,232
after me fixing up
all your cuts and bruises like I done.

143
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:37,635
I hope it happens again.
I won't do it. That's all.

144
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,358
- Shut up!
- I take it back, Joe.

145
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:42,398
If it does happen again,
I'll do just like I done before,

146
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:45,278
only I hope
you have more cuts and bruises to fix.

147
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:48,834
Hey, Dude. Dude, come here a minute.

148
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,034
What do you want?

149
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:53,948
Why don't you sit in here
in place of Stumpy?

150
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,795
I'd rather listen to a drunk than him.

151
00:12:58,080 --> 00:12:59,911
How you holding up, Borrachn?

152
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:01,919
Got the shakes yet?

153
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:04,231
That beer ain't gonna do you no good.

154
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,550
You'll have to get something stronger
than that.

155
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:09,438
If you're still broke,
I think I got another dollar.

156
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,232
Chance, you gonna let him do that to me?

157
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,639
I'll do better than that.

158
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,837
I'll let him have the key to your cell
anytime he wants it.

159
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:24,753
It'd be too easy.
He's got nobody to back him up.

160
00:13:25,920 --> 00:13:28,673
If he talks out of turn,
throw a bucket of water on him.

161
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,997
I'll throw one in the middle of his bed
and leave him sleep in it.

162
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,354
Want another beer?

163
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,871
You kind of wasted some of that last one.

164
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,349
No, it wasn't wasted,
except I missed him.

165
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:40,313
I don't need any more.

166
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:41,674
Hey, in the jail.

167
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:48,035
That's far enough. What do you want?

168
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,152
Mr. Wheeler said to bring this package
to the Sheriff.

169
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:53,317
Hey, Chance, you expecting a package?

170
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,628
Be right out.

171
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:56,195
Stumpy?

172
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,315
Yeah?

173
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,550
Going over to the hotel
for a few minutes.

174
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:02,757
If you don't come back,
me and Joe'll have us a good cry.

175
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:04,757
Just keep that door locked.

176
00:14:06,440 --> 00:14:08,590
- Thanks for your trouble.
- No trouble at all.

177
00:14:08,680 --> 00:14:10,910
Wheeler says just be careful coming up.

178
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,589
Looks like our friend's still on the job.

179
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,035
Yeah.

180
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,755
There's another one over by the church.

181
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,392
Any use in arresting him?

182
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,877
For just standing around?

183
00:14:24,040 --> 00:14:26,031
All I'd do is get another one.

184
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,515
The jail isn't big enough
to hold all of 'em.

185
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:32,479
As a matter of fact,
they'd like to get a few in jail.

186
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:34,033
Remember that.

187
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,436
<i>Seor</i> Chance. I've been looking for you.
I have a message for...

188
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,635
What you have here?

189
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,631
The package you've been waiting for.

190
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,679
- Just in time, <i>seor</i>.
- Carlos! Carlos! Where you are?

191
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,988
I'm over here.

192
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,798
You keep it. Consuela, she come now.

193
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,476
<i>Carlos. Seor</i> Chance.

194
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:59,511
I just ask Carlos if he's...

195
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,955
Carlos, what is wrong?

196
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:05,074
You look like the cat
who swallows the chicken.

197
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,673
What have you been doing?

198
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,193
What have I been doing?

199
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,798
I've been talking to my friend
the Sheriff,

200
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,716
that's what I have been doing.

201
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,279
We have important business.

202
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,430
You say I look like the cat
who eats too much.

203
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,238
Consuela, look at me.

204
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,429
Am I fat?

205
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,432
- I did not say you are fat.
- Please, Consuela, do not say more.

206
00:15:21,520 --> 00:15:23,112
You already say too much.

207
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,515
Me and my friend
will make our business alone.

208
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:26,715
Come, <i>seor</i>.

209
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,038
You take chances, my friend.

210
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,439
Because I know woman.

211
00:15:40,520 --> 00:15:42,670
If she will be mad
or she will be sorry...

212
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:45,274
If it is mad, she will be
much pleasure to make right,

213
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,874
and if she is sorry,
it will be the same pleasure.

214
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,712
You do not have women,

215
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,279
so you do not know, <i>seor</i>,

216
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:54,113
but me, Carlos Robante, I know.

217
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,800
Wait till I show you
what is in this package.

218
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,834
Then you tell me
if I do not know about women.

219
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,672
If I had bought these myself, <i>seor</i>,
everyone in town would have known,

220
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,855
and it's not the sort of thing

221
00:16:09,256 --> 00:16:12,031
that Consuela would like
to have known by everyone.

222
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,589
You see?

223
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:20,877
Are they not beautiful, <i>seor?</i>

224
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,869
Can you make the picture
how she will look?

225
00:16:24,040 --> 00:16:25,871
You sure you want me to do that?

226
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,075
No, <i>seor</i>.

227
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,830
Do not make the picture.
It is best for me to do it.

228
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,832
I beg your pardon, gentlemen,
but I'm looking for a...

229
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:37,472
Those things have great possibilities,
but not for you.

230
00:16:40,440 --> 00:16:42,078
What are you doing here?

231
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,309
Until I saw those things,
I was looking for a towel.

232
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,799
I'd like to take a bath.

233
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,393
Didn't you come in on the stage?

234
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:49,469
That's right.

235
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,039
Why aren't you on it?

236
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:53,960
Whoever heard of a stagecoach
having a bathroom?

237
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,991
I forgot.
I start to tell you, and I forgot.

238
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:58,752
The stage, she did not go.

239
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:00,355
Why?

240
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:01,509
Something happened with the wheel.

241
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:02,589
Where's Jake?

242
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:05,114
Near the corral. He must fix the wheel
before he can leave.

243
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:06,474
That's just fine.

244
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,876
Hey, Sheriff, you forgot your pants.

245
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,830
You reckon they'll try anything tonight?

246
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:07,151
Could be. Nathan Burdette's smart.
Don't underrate him.

247
00:18:07,240 --> 00:18:08,912
That ain't no kind of answer.

248
00:18:09,000 --> 00:18:11,355
How or what he'll do, I don't know.

249
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,798
Your guess is as good as mine.

250
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:15,791
What I want to know is when.

251
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:18,511
I wish he'd hurry up and do it.

252
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,958
Have a bottle of beer, Dude?

253
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,758
I'm full of beer.

254
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,557
It doesn't do any good.

255
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,638
It'll start working on you
tomorrow or the next day.

256
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,109
Stumpy,

257
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:48,355
we're gonna take a turn around the town.

258
00:18:49,640 --> 00:18:51,790
- You be all right?
- Course I'll be all right.

259
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,552
Then get in there where you belong.

260
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:56,154
I'm going, but you remember one thing.

261
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,753
When you come back,
you holler before you open that door.

262
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,229
I'm liable to blast you
just for the heck of it.

263
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,469
We'll holler.

264
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,560
You got any particular reason
for going out tonight?

265
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:14,755
Usually do.

266
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,515
Don't want to do anything different.
They might think we're scared.

267
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,194
Aren't we?

268
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:24,115
I just can't take it sitting in there.

269
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,510
You mean you saw I couldn't take it.

270
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,548
Don't set yourself up
as being so special.

271
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:32,076
Think you invented the hangover.

272
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:35,068
I could sure take out a patent
for this one.

273
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,868
Take that side.

274
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:15,795
Good evening.

275
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,713
Yes, sir.

276
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,951
Hold it, Dude. Stairway.

277
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:33,919
Don't shoot, Sheriff.

278
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:35,758
Just getting a little air.

279
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,074
I'm getting jumpy.

280
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:12,549
I'll walk along with you
and hold your hand.

281
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,432
Get back over there where you belong.

282
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:15,555
Yes, Papa.

283
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:31,833
- Carlos.
- <i>Seor</i> Chance. I been looking for you.

284
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,956
- It is very bad, <i>seor</i>.
- What's wrong?

285
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,110
- Your friend <i>Seor</i> Wheeler.
- What about him?

286
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:39,875
He is a good friend,
and he wishes good for you, so he talks.

287
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,190
He talks to people. He talk to everybody.

288
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:45,637
He say, why they don't help you,
that you should have some more help.

289
00:22:45,720 --> 00:22:47,358
He's right, <i>Seor</i> Chance,

290
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,829
but is no good to say such things
to the wrong people.

291
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:50,909
You tell him.

292
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:51,989
Is he in there?

293
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,797
Chance, he's over there.

294
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,108
Queens full.

295
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:01,072
- That's good.
- Beats me.

296
00:23:09,160 --> 00:23:10,832
Spare a minute, Pat?

297
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:12,319
Good evening, Sheriff.

298
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,515
Deal me out.

299
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,589
Evening.

300
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,352
You two know each other?

301
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,635
Yeah.

302
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:29,073
No, thanks, Carlos.

303
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:31,511
Chance, I've been wanting to talk to you.

304
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:33,556
You've been talking too much, Pat.

305
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,119
What do you mean,
I've been talking too much?

306
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:38,670
Anybody that sides in with me right now's
liable to find themselves

307
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:40,432
up to their ears in trouble.

308
00:23:40,520 --> 00:23:42,272
Is that why you haven't asked
for any deputies?

309
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:43,395
Carlos.

310
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:46,870
Give me a new deck of cards.
I'm not having any luck with this one.

311
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:50,673
I was talking about why
you haven't asked for any new deputies.

312
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:52,079
- You could get some, you know.
- Yeah.

313
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,912
How about my drivers?
You could use them.

314
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,070
Suppose I got 'em, what'd I have?

315
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,077
Some well-meaning amateurs,

316
00:23:58,160 --> 00:24:00,754
most of them worried
about their wives and kids.

317
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,398
Burdette has 30 or 40 men,
all professionals.

318
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:07,990
Only thing they're worried about
is earning their pay.

319
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:13,117
No, Pat. All I'd be doing is giving 'em
more targets to shoot at.

320
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,198
A lot of people would get hurt.

321
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,353
Joe Burdette isn't worth it.

322
00:24:17,440 --> 00:24:19,908
He isn't worth
one of those that'd get killed.

323
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,672
Then what are you gonna do?

324
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,672
All you got for help's that old man
down at the jail and this...

325
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:27,069
Borrachn's the name, Mr. Wheeler.

326
00:24:27,680 --> 00:24:30,148
I'll go outside
so you can talk more freely.

327
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,039
Wasn't good, Pat.

328
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,919
Let's sit down.

329
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,479
Yeah, I know.

330
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,513
I shouldn't have said it.

331
00:24:41,600 --> 00:24:43,397
I meant nothing by it,

332
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,228
but I'm so used to stumbling
over that fella.

333
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:49,352
I don't think I ever did see him
standing on his own two feet

334
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:51,112
without something to help hold him up.

335
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,031
How long you been coming here?

336
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:54,519
Going on two years.

337
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:56,716
If you'd have come through
three years ago,

338
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,279
you wouldn't have stumbled over him.

339
00:24:58,360 --> 00:24:59,759
Dude was good.

340
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,229
He was my deputy.

341
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:03,436
Best man with a gun I ever worked with.

342
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,636
That's pretty hard to believe, Chance.

343
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:06,789
What...

344
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,997
A girl. Just a girl that came through
on the stage.

345
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:12,994
She was no good,
but couldn't tell him that.

346
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:15,230
I tried, and he damned near killed me.

347
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:17,993
Anyway, he was hooked.

348
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:19,429
Went away with her.

349
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:21,954
Six months later,
he came back without her.

350
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:25,391
That's when the Mexicans
started calling him Borrachn.

351
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,317
- That's Spanish for...
- I know.

352
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,035
He told me.

353
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:32,673
So for two years, he's been drinking,

354
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:38,194
all he could buy or somebody'd buy
for him, until last night.

355
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,871
And how long do you think that'll last?

356
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,154
I don't know.

357
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:45,792
So in the meantime,
you have to take care of him, huh?

358
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,917
He's been doing a pretty good job
of taking care of me.

359
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,630
I'm supposed to be your friend, too.

360
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,391
Why don't you let me help you?

361
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:56,469
You're not good enough.

362
00:25:56,560 --> 00:25:58,312
I don't know.
I'm at least as good as that...

363
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:01,233
If you're so good,
why did you have to hire Colorado?

364
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,072
No, thanks. You keep out of it.

365
00:26:03,160 --> 00:26:04,957
- Hey, that's an idea.
- What?

366
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:06,871
Ryan. Colorado you call him.

367
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,668
He's young, Chance, but he's good,
real good.

368
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:13,312
I could use him if he's good,
but that's up to him.

369
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,558
Let me see what he says.

370
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:35,959
Evening, Sheriff.

371
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,479
Any luck, kid?

372
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,154
It's a pretty fast game.

373
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,119
Son, I asked you over here
because the Sheriff's a friend of mine.

374
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:46,433
He's got trouble. He can use a good man.

375
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:48,991
To go against the Burdettes, Sheriff?

376
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:50,274
That's right.

377
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:52,636
I told him you were one of the best.

378
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:55,149
Well,

379
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:59,474
I'll tell you what I'm a lot better at,
Mr. Wheeler.

380
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,471
That's minding my own business.

381
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:03,479
No offense, Sheriff.

382
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:05,515
No offense.

383
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:13,036
I never expected that.

384
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:15,112
He showed good sense.

385
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,716
- I'd like to have him.
- I don't see why you can't...

386
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,631
Quit stewing, Pat. You tried.

387
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:21,433
I appreciate it.

388
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:24,399
All right, if you don't want me,
I'll round up my men and get set

389
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:27,517
for an early start in the morning.
See you before I go.

390
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,353
Enough for me for a while.

391
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,078
You leaving?

392
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:36,798
Maybe I'll have some luck
now that you're going.

393
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:39,599
Maybe, if you play your cards right.

394
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,955
Hope you leave some of your luck
with me.

395
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,395
I'll come back
and give it to you next time.

396
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,913
Well, ante up.

397
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,189
Dude?

398
00:27:49,280 --> 00:27:50,315
Yeah?

399
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:52,871
I'll be out in a couple of minutes.

400
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,153
Hiya, Sheriff.

401
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:17,274
I'm sorry about those pants.

402
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:19,432
Carlos told me they weren't yours.

403
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,159
You're in trouble, lady.
I'd like to talk to you.

404
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:24,709
Sure.

405
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:31,592
Sheriff, what is it?

406
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:35,510
I was looking through the deck of cards
you people were using.

407
00:28:36,440 --> 00:28:38,032
Three cards short.

408
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,517
Pretty obvious ones, aces.

409
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,676
Why do you tell me?

410
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:48,352
I know every one in that game except
you and the fellow in the checkered vest.

411
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,788
And did you talk to him?

412
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,950
He's still there. You were leaving.

413
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:54,032
And I was a winner.

414
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,516
Is that all you've got to go on?

415
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,596
No, here's a handbill

416
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,275
about a gambler they're interested
in catching up with.

417
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:06,349
WANTED

418
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,873
You know him?

419
00:29:08,360 --> 00:29:10,112
Says he had a girl with him.

420
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:15,112
Says the girl's about 22,
five foot, five inches tall,

421
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,713
good figure, brown hair
and wears feathers.

422
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:26,158
Now, the man isn't
our friend in the checkered vest,

423
00:29:26,240 --> 00:29:28,196
but you could be the girl.

424
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,752
Yes, I could be.

425
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:34,396
As a matter of fact, I am.

426
00:29:37,280 --> 00:29:39,748
Make sure you're on the stage
in the morning.

427
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,273
You'd better give me the money you won.

428
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,635
I'll see that it gets back
to the right people.

429
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,118
It's pretty easy, isn't it?

430
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:51,838
Just give you the money
and get on the stage.

431
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,436
But I'm not gonna make it that easy.

432
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:59,195
You've made me mad, Sheriff.
You didn't ask me if I took those cards,

433
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,635
so you're gonna have to prove
I've got them.

434
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,950
The only way I know you can do that
is to search me.

435
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,632
- Search you?
- That's right.

436
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:08,838
Isn't that what a sheriff usually does
to a prisoner?

437
00:30:08,920 --> 00:30:13,232
Let's see, the cards could be
in my purse, but they're not.

438
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:17,082
They could be in my shoes,
my stockings,

439
00:30:17,117 --> 00:30:18,010
- All right, all right.
- garters.

440
00:30:18,045 --> 00:30:20,635
I don't wear anything
like those red pants,

441
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:23,678
and my sleeves are too tight,
but there's my waist.

442
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,993
You've got a job to do.
Where do you intend to begin?

443
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:29,992
- That's about enough of that.
- You have to prove I've got those cards.

444
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,958
- You keep going, and I'm apt to do it!
- I'm not so sure.

445
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,718
I think you're embarrassed,

446
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,789
and if you're not...

447
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:38,871
If he's not, he ought to be.

448
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,678
What are you doing here?

449
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:42,956
I don't think she has the cards,

450
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:45,076
if that's what you're looking for.

451
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,273
How do you know?

452
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:49,396
I think
the fella in the checkered vest has 'em.

453
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,198
Why didn't you find out?

454
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,999
I said I wouldn't start anything
till I told you first.

455
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,435
Now I'm telling you.
I'm gonna see if he's got 'em.

456
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:57,919
Wait a minute.

457
00:30:58,960 --> 00:30:59,995
You want to come along?

458
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:01,115
I do.

459
00:31:01,400 --> 00:31:02,879
I'm interested, too.

460
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,273
Ace-high straight.

461
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,593
Looks like I got the lady's luck.

462
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,990
All right, keep your hands on the table,

463
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,559
right where they are.

464
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:34,038
Put your hands back,

465
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,519
where they were.

466
00:31:48,760 --> 00:31:49,954
Hold out.

467
00:31:50,840 --> 00:31:52,478
He's all yours, Sheriff.

468
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:53,869
Get up.

469
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,155
Get up!

470
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:00,308
We don't like tinhorns around here,
mister.

471
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,830
Carlos, lock him in his room.

472
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:05,271
Let him out in time for the stage.

473
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:08,598
You losers can help yourself
to what's on the table.

474
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,315
Thanks, Colorado.

475
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,119
Sheriff, aren't you forgetting something?

476
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,709
I guess I was wrong
about you having those cards.

477
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,039
Is that all, Sheriff?

478
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:31,999
I'm not gonna apologize,
if that's what you mean.

479
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:35,114
We haven't gotten past that handbill,
have we?

480
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,474
That's right.

481
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:39,473
You haven't done anything
to make me think we will.

482
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:43,078
Idea of being searched
didn't bother you much.

483
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:44,634
Made a joke out of it.

484
00:32:44,720 --> 00:32:47,109
And instead of me being embarrassed,
you were.

485
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,536
- Could be...
- Tell me, Sheriff,

486
00:32:49,256 --> 00:32:50,272
what should I have done?

487
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:52,234
- Well...
- I'd like to know.

488
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:55,518
This isn't the first time
that handbill has come up.

489
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,790
I'd like to know what to do about it.

490
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,550
You could quit playing cards,

491
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,599
wearing feathers.

492
00:33:03,680 --> 00:33:04,999
No, Sheriff.

493
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:08,232
No, I'm not gonna do that.

494
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:13,115
You see, that's what I'd do

495
00:33:14,600 --> 00:33:17,319
if I were the kind of girl
that you think I am.

496
00:33:36,560 --> 00:33:38,073
Dude, you seen Wheeler?

497
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:40,037
Not since he went up the street.

498
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:41,951
I think that's him coming now.

499
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,553
Get him out of here.

500
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,919
Watch the stable.
That's where the shot came from.

501
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,038
Got him in the back.

502
00:34:09,600 --> 00:34:10,589
He's dead.

503
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:16,954
Didn't take 'em long, less than an hour
after he offered to help.

504
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:20,351
Don't get many friends like that.

505
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,439
You were smart, Colorado.

506
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,794
No one's come out of the stable.

507
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,393
I want to go with you.

508
00:34:26,640 --> 00:34:29,234
Want to help get the man
that killed your boss?

509
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,515
Wouldn't you?

510
00:34:30,600 --> 00:34:32,158
I wouldn't have let him get shot.

511
00:34:32,240 --> 00:34:34,708
You had a chance to get in this,
and you didn't want it.

512
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,791
Stay out. We don't need you.

513
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:39,792
If you want to do something,
get him out of the street.

514
00:34:43,880 --> 00:34:46,872
Get around to the side
where you can see front and back.

515
00:34:47,360 --> 00:34:48,588
How you going in?

516
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,752
Right through the door.
If he comes out, you can have him.

517
00:34:52,280 --> 00:34:54,635
There's no sense in me
telling you to cool down first.

518
00:34:54,720 --> 00:34:56,039
No, there isn't.

519
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,189
I thought so.

520
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,350
I'll let you know when I get there.

521
00:36:01,520 --> 00:36:03,033
Chance, you all right?

522
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,758
Chance, out here.

523
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,074
You all right?

524
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,872
Just dirt in my eyes. Did you get him?

525
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,996
He came out the side door.
He was running fast.

526
00:36:27,080 --> 00:36:29,196
- And you missed him.
- I couldn't get a good shot at him.

527
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:32,636
- Might've winged him.
- Don't worry. It's my fault we lost him.

528
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:35,075
He hasn't got away yet,
or I wouldn't be standing here.

529
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,469
He went into Burdette's saloon.
He's still in there.

530
00:36:37,560 --> 00:36:39,073
How do you know?

531
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,157
Can see both doors from here,

532
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,998
and there ain't any others.

533
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,118
I'm an expert on saloons.

534
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,279
Get a chance to see who he was?

535
00:36:47,360 --> 00:36:49,112
No, but we'll know.
He'll have muddy boots.

536
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:51,509
He stepped in that puddle by the trough.

537
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:55,190
You figure
we're going in there after him?

538
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,918
- Aren't we?
- We used to.

539
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,149
There's eight or 10 Burdette men
in there.

540
00:37:01,120 --> 00:37:02,394
Maybe more.

541
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,228
You take the back door.
I'll go in the front.

542
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,675
I'd like to try...

543
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:09,318
You'd like to try what?

544
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,471
I been going in the back door.

545
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:15,189
They haven't been letting me
in the front.

546
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:18,312
Think you're good enough?

547
00:37:18,400 --> 00:37:19,913
I'd like to find out.

548
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,359
So would I.

549
00:37:22,080 --> 00:37:24,469
I'll let you know when I get around back.

550
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,032
Begin with you, Charlie.

551
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,836
That shotgun you keep under the bar,

552
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,512
pick it up by the barrels.

553
00:38:32,240 --> 00:38:33,229
Easy.

554
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:36,790
Thought you were gonna ask for a drink.
It's been a long dry spell.

555
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:38,274
Shotgun first.

556
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:40,155
Set it down.

557
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,709
Back up.

558
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:50,518
Jim, Pedro, get over there.

559
00:38:57,560 --> 00:39:01,348
All right, the rest of you,
I'm not gonna tell you twice.

560
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:05,271
You're gonna stand up
and stand real still.

561
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:07,235
Now!

562
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:16,270
All right, now one by one,
start with you, unbuckle your guns,

563
00:39:16,520 --> 00:39:18,192
drop 'em and step back.

564
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:21,949
Come on.

565
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:31,069
There's no reason
for you to move, Charlie.

566
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:36,314
What's this all about?

567
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:38,789
We're looking for a man that ran in here.

568
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:40,433
Nobody's run in here.

569
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,636
We'll remember you said that.

570
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:47,110
Man we're looking for has muddy boots.

571
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,990
Now, one by one, hold up your feet.

572
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,036
Who saw a man run in here?

573
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,149
I did.

574
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,954
Almost forgot about you, Charlie.
Come on out.

575
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,318
Clean as a whistle.

576
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:18,990
Dude, you been seeing things again.

577
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,672
You better have a drink.

578
00:40:22,800 --> 00:40:23,869
Dude,

579
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,713
maybe this'll help.

580
00:41:07,080 --> 00:41:09,389
Guess I'll take that drink now, Charlie.

581
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,672
I thought you would.

582
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,917
You want that gun, pick it up.

583
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,634
I wish you would.

584
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,631
Stepped in a puddle all right.

585
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,158
It's the fella we wanted.

586
00:41:35,520 --> 00:41:36,999
I guess this is his,

587
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:39,275
a nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

588
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:43,516
It's just about what Burdette
would figure a man's life was worth.

589
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,271
That's earning money the hard way.

590
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:51,079
Paid killer.

591
00:41:52,280 --> 00:41:55,192
Nice, fresh $50 gold piece.

592
00:41:57,040 --> 00:41:59,349
You, mister, you got one in your pocket?

593
00:41:59,640 --> 00:42:00,993
Nobody paid me.

594
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,469
Nobody.

595
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:05,394
And nobody run in here, either, huh?

596
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:07,349
Chance.

597
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,317
I'm not gonna hurt him.

598
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:10,589
Get up!

599
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,434
You're all in it,

600
00:42:14,560 --> 00:42:16,039
the whole lot of you.

601
00:42:17,160 --> 00:42:18,991
You're gonna get out of town,

602
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,397
take your boy here with you.

603
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:24,795
You can tell Burdette you got Wheeler.

604
00:42:25,680 --> 00:42:28,956
You can tell him anybody else he sends,
he'd better pay 'em more

605
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,996
'cause they're gonna earn it.

606
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:34,277
Charlie, I want you to...

607
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:38,638
You finished yet, Dude?

608
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,309
You in a hurry?

609
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:41,628
Not especially.

610
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:54,475
You threw the silver dollar, didn't you?

611
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:56,836
- Yeah, Dude, I...
- You want it back?

612
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,671
- Sure.
- You know how to get it?

613
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,115
Yeah.

614
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,998
That's all for me, Chance.

615
00:43:21,680 --> 00:43:22,874
Charlie, come here.

616
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,075
Yeah, Sheriff.

617
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:25,479
You're going with us.

618
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:27,391
Why pick on me? Why choose me?

619
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:30,119
You're carrying these guns
down to the jail for us.

620
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:32,350
All right, back up and give him room.

621
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:38,868
I guess they'll let you
in the front door from now on.

622
00:43:45,400 --> 00:43:48,790
You mean to tell me you followed him
into Burdette's saloon?

623
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:50,793
Why, you're crazy,

624
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:53,110
and you are, too. What happened?

625
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:55,153
He was hiding in the loft.

626
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:56,229
Who got him?

627
00:43:56,320 --> 00:43:57,958
Dude did. One shot.

628
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:00,792
I wish I could've seen that.

629
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,711
I wish Wheeler could've, too.

630
00:44:03,200 --> 00:44:05,760
Wheeler didn't think
Dude and me was much good.

631
00:44:05,960 --> 00:44:08,713
Leastways it'd have showed him
he was wrong about Dude, anyways.

632
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,870
He was wrong about Dude, all right.

633
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:13,311
You were good in there tonight,

634
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:15,558
good as you've ever been,

635
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:18,560
but you know one reason
why you got by with it?

636
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:22,549
They were laughing at you.
Borrachn talking big.

637
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,150
You surprised 'em,
but next time, they'll be ready for you.

638
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:28,470
Next time,
they'll shoot first and laugh afterwards.

639
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:30,039
Listen to him!

640
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:31,348
Don't get too cocksure.

641
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,271
What a stinker! Spit in his eye, Dude.

642
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:35,749
Never mind him.
He's always been a stinker.

643
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:38,229
If he were to change,
that would worry me.

644
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,594
You'd think
I could get one out of a whole sack.

645
00:44:42,680 --> 00:44:45,069
How'd you know
that fella was in the loft?

646
00:44:45,560 --> 00:44:48,791
He was losing blood.
It was dripping into a drink on the bar.

647
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,714
Just when I couldn't find anybody
with muddy boots.

648
00:44:51,800 --> 00:44:53,756
I could've sure used a drink then.

649
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:56,798
If he was bleeding, that means
you hit him on the run outside.

650
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,997
You did, Dude? Say, that ain't bad.
That ain't bad at all.

651
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:03,112
Ain't good, either.
We had to go in after him.

652
00:45:04,040 --> 00:45:07,396
Chance, nobody please you no-how?

653
00:45:07,800 --> 00:45:09,438
You got a light, Stumpy?

654
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:11,034
Hey, in the jail!

655
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,792
It's me, Colorado.

656
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:14,555
Let him in.

657
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,229
Come on in.

658
00:45:21,640 --> 00:45:23,949
I hear you got the man who shot Wheeler.

659
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:25,434
Dude did.

660
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,439
Thanks, Dude.

661
00:45:30,240 --> 00:45:32,117
Gonna bury him in the morning.

662
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,555
I've just been at the undertaker's
with him.

663
00:45:34,640 --> 00:45:36,949
Here's the money and the papers
he had on him.

664
00:45:37,040 --> 00:45:38,996
I took out $60 he owed me.

665
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:41,159
You got yours.

666
00:45:41,480 --> 00:45:42,879
How about the rest?

667
00:45:43,080 --> 00:45:44,798
Did he owe them, too?

668
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:46,149
Probably did.

669
00:45:46,760 --> 00:45:48,637
Didn't think about that.

670
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:52,037
I can't turn anything over to you
till I get a court order.

671
00:45:52,120 --> 00:45:53,792
Does that mean you hold the wagons, too?

672
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,199
That's right.

673
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:56,952
Meantime, I'm broke.

674
00:45:57,800 --> 00:46:00,837
If you or any of the rest
are short eating money,

675
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:04,317
I'll go good for it.
I'll tell 'em at the hotel.

676
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:07,712
I wish you'd do that soon
before anything happens to you.

677
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,918
No offense again, Sheriff.

678
00:46:14,080 --> 00:46:16,548
It's nice to see a smart kid
for a change.

679
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:19,360
Yeah, he ain't like the usual kid
with a gun.

680
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:22,909
Wonder if he's as good as Wheeler said?

681
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:24,953
I'd say he is.

682
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,310
I'd say he's so good,
he doesn't feel he has to prove it.

683
00:46:38,200 --> 00:46:39,349
Don't you ever sleep?

684
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:42,477
I was beginning to think you didn't.
I wanted to talk to you.

685
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,630
Don't tell me
you're still looking for an apology.

686
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:45,755
No.

687
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,556
No, I was thinking of making one.

688
00:46:48,720 --> 00:46:50,631
I was pretty much of a...

689
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:53,759
I got out of line tonight,
and I'm not proud of it.

690
00:46:53,960 --> 00:46:58,238
My only excuse is, I didn't know
about all the trouble you were in.

691
00:47:06,040 --> 00:47:08,554
I'm gonna have a drink. How about you?

692
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:11,750
Thanks, I'd like one.

693
00:47:13,840 --> 00:47:16,559
I'm sorry about Mr. Wheeler.

694
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:19,195
Carlos told me he was a friend of yours.

695
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:22,996
That's why he got shot,
or did Carlos tell you that, too?

696
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:24,513
Yes, he told me.

697
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:29,629
How does a man get to be a sheriff?

698
00:47:30,440 --> 00:47:31,634
Gets lazy.

699
00:47:31,760 --> 00:47:37,153
Gets tired of selling his gun all over.
Decides to sell it in one place.

700
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:39,037
I'd say you made a poor sale.

701
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:41,794
A lot of people around here
will agree with you.

702
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:45,475
But it's still a sale,
and it's too late to back out.

703
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:49,599
Not to change the subject, but how does
a girl get herself on a handbill?

704
00:47:50,440 --> 00:47:51,998
She gets married.

705
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,832
- Handbill says he was a cheat.
- He wasn't a cheat then.

706
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:59,590
That came later, after his luck turned.

707
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:02,836
It was probably my fault he cheated.

708
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:04,956
He liked to buy me things.

709
00:48:05,120 --> 00:48:06,473
Then why did you leave him?

710
00:48:06,560 --> 00:48:07,754
I didn't.

711
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,198
He left me rather suddenly.

712
00:48:12,360 --> 00:48:14,749
He was caught just like that man tonight,

713
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,637
only his luck had run out.

714
00:48:17,960 --> 00:48:19,313
He was shot.

715
00:48:20,600 --> 00:48:22,192
You've had a rough time.

716
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,072
You're wrong, Sheriff.
I've had a good time.

717
00:48:27,680 --> 00:48:29,033
I liked gambling.

718
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,678
We went everywhere,
had the best of everything.

719
00:48:33,880 --> 00:48:38,158
I didn't know that he was cheating
until they caught him,

720
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:42,156
and if I had known,
it might have been rough.

721
00:48:42,240 --> 00:48:44,390
That's probably why he didn't tell me.

722
00:48:44,480 --> 00:48:45,913
When did this happen?

723
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:48,116
About four months ago.

724
00:48:49,960 --> 00:48:53,430
Since then, I've been working

725
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,595
to get enough money for stage fare.

726
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,353
You going home?

727
00:48:58,520 --> 00:48:59,953
I haven't any.

728
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,314
<i>Seor</i> Chance!

729
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,994
I didn't know you were here.
Why do you not tell me?

730
00:49:04,080 --> 00:49:07,356
You should be in bed.
Last night, you slept just a little bit,

731
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,273
but tonight, <i>seor</i>, you will sleep well.
I will watch.

732
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:12,510
No, Carlos, you stay out of it.

733
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,750
I don't want anybody else helping me.

734
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:20,753
This is my hotel,
and you are a guest under my roof,

735
00:49:21,360 --> 00:49:25,035
and I will not be told what I shall do
and what I shall not do, <i>seor</i>.

736
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:27,589
All right, Carlos.

737
00:49:27,680 --> 00:49:28,715
What you do?

738
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:29,835
I'll sleep in the jail.

739
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,194
But you can't sleep...

740
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:35,080
There's no need to watch.
I'm a light sleeper.

741
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,833
I'll lock the door
and hook a chair under the knob.

742
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:40,309
Anybody tries to get in, I'll hear 'em.

743
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,913
- One thing.
- What?

744
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:44,230
If I'm asleep at sunup, wake me.

745
00:49:44,960 --> 00:49:46,871
- But it's not enough.
- Will you?

746
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,715
I say no more. Have a good sleep.

747
00:49:52,800 --> 00:49:54,153
I'm gonna turn in.

748
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:56,955
If I don't see you in the morning,
so long.

749
00:49:57,040 --> 00:49:58,075
So long.

750
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:01,193
By the way, where are you going?

751
00:50:01,680 --> 00:50:04,240
Some place
where there aren't any handbills.

752
00:50:04,320 --> 00:50:08,199
That thing keeps popping up.
That's why I'm a little touchy about it.

753
00:50:09,840 --> 00:50:12,149
I know the sheriff that got these out.

754
00:50:13,240 --> 00:50:16,073
I'll write him a letter,
get 'em called in.

755
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:20,151
Then you won't have people like me
making trouble for you.

756
00:50:29,120 --> 00:50:30,439
Well,

757
00:50:32,720 --> 00:50:33,835
thanks.

758
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:13,755
Carlos!

759
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:17,839
It's after 7:00.
Why didn't you wake me up?

760
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:19,273
- The girl.
- The girl?

761
00:51:19,360 --> 00:51:20,554
That one with the feathers.

762
00:51:20,640 --> 00:51:21,993
What's she got to do with it?

763
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,593
She told me not to wake you.

764
00:51:23,680 --> 00:51:25,830
She was sitting outside your room
in a chair.

765
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,831
Sitting outside my room in a chair?

766
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,909
All night long.

767
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:31,116
She was still there
two, three minutes ago.

768
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,670
Most likely she hear you get up.
She told me not to wake you, <i>seor</i>.

769
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,478
You can tell her...

770
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,436
- The fool!
- Tell her she's a fool?

771
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,318
No! I'll tell her myself.

772
00:51:42,480 --> 00:51:44,118
You tell her she's a fool?

773
00:51:44,240 --> 00:51:45,753
I didn't say I was.

774
00:51:45,840 --> 00:51:47,910
He say...

775
00:51:48,920 --> 00:51:50,319
She say...

776
00:51:51,080 --> 00:51:53,310
Me, I'm in the middle.

777
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,189
Who is it?

778
00:51:57,280 --> 00:51:58,759
It's me, the Sheriff.

779
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,234
Just a minute.

780
00:52:06,920 --> 00:52:07,989
Come on in.

781
00:52:12,120 --> 00:52:13,155
Hi.

782
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:15,312
Did you get a good night's sleep?

783
00:52:15,400 --> 00:52:16,435
Who, me?

784
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,875
Yes, you.
There's nobody else in the room.

785
00:52:19,520 --> 00:52:21,476
Carlos had to go and talk.

786
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:25,836
I couldn't sleep anyway. I was just
as well off out there in the hall.

787
00:52:25,920 --> 00:52:28,718
If anybody had come in,
you'd have yelled before they shot you.

788
00:52:28,800 --> 00:52:30,392
Is that it? Fool women.

789
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,630
- Didn't you hear me say that...
- I know.

790
00:52:32,720 --> 00:52:35,757
You don't want anyone to help you.
I heard you tell Carlos.

791
00:52:35,840 --> 00:52:38,149
- Why did you do it?
- You weren't supposed to know about it.

792
00:52:38,240 --> 00:52:40,834
Why didn't you just go out
and not talk to Carlos?

793
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:42,433
He didn't wake me up!

794
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,875
Don't blame him. That was my fault.

795
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:47,549
All right, nothing happened.
Nobody got hurt.

796
00:52:47,640 --> 00:52:49,835
You got some sleep. I lost some.

797
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:52,275
Now I'm tired, and you're mad,
and I'm getting mad,

798
00:52:52,360 --> 00:52:54,590
so you'd better go on.

799
00:52:54,680 --> 00:52:56,557
I'm gonna get some sleep, too.

800
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:58,517
You can't go to bed now.

801
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:00,194
I can't?

802
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:02,870
You just see whether or not
I can go to bed now or not.

803
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:05,190
You've got to get on that stagecoach.

804
00:53:05,560 --> 00:53:08,233
- What'd you say?
- The stage, it leaves in an hour.

805
00:53:08,320 --> 00:53:10,595
- Why didn't you tell me?
- I just did.

806
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:15,430
Then you better get out, then,
so I can get a bath and pack my things.

807
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:17,397
I can't do it
if you stand around talking.

808
00:53:17,480 --> 00:53:19,277
You're doing most of the talking.

809
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:20,554
That's right. I am,

810
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:22,471
and I can't do that
and bathe and pack, too.

811
00:53:22,560 --> 00:53:24,198
- Will you just go on and go?
- I'm going.

812
00:53:24,280 --> 00:53:25,679
Then do it. Don't talk any more.

813
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:28,558
I'm doing enough
and neither of us are saying anything,

814
00:53:28,640 --> 00:53:30,995
so just go on
and let me get on the stage.

815
00:53:32,520 --> 00:53:34,112
Oh, hell! Goodbye.

816
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,272
I just wanted to...

817
00:53:37,520 --> 00:53:39,636
You could've at least let me finish.

818
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:44,194
You try to help someone
who doesn't want any help.

819
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,157
I guess I talk too much.

820
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:51,191
- You tell her?
- Tell her what?

821
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:52,599
That she's a fool?

822
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:55,549
She's going on the stage?

823
00:53:55,640 --> 00:53:58,074
She's going on the stage,
and you make sure she does.

824
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,515
You say she was going,
why should I make sure?

825
00:54:00,600 --> 00:54:02,830
Because I say for you
to make sure she does.

826
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:04,194
I hold you responsible.

827
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:05,554
Responsible, me?

828
00:54:05,680 --> 00:54:06,669
Yes.

829
00:54:09,760 --> 00:54:12,877
Dude, he's up the street.
He told me to tell you he's gone.

830
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:14,154
So I see.

831
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:16,677
There's a lot of people in town today.

832
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:19,639
Did you hear why?

833
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:24,077
A man say he hear maybe Nathan Burdette
will come to see you today.

834
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:26,151
Most likely they here to watch.

835
00:54:26,920 --> 00:54:29,798
If he does, they may see something.

836
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:31,753
I don't like it.

837
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:33,034
Neither do I.

838
00:54:39,040 --> 00:54:41,031
Tom, just hang your gun on the fence
with the others.

839
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:43,759
- You can pick it up when you leave.
- Sure enough.

840
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:10,992
That's far enough.

841
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:13,111
I got orders to take your guns.

842
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:15,956
Suppose we don't want to give 'em up?

843
00:55:16,040 --> 00:55:18,634
You think you're good enough
to take 'em against six of us?

844
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,871
For a smart man, Mr. Burdette,
that's pretty stupid.

845
00:55:22,320 --> 00:55:25,676
You won't need a gun no more
'cause you'd be the first man I'd get.

846
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:27,079
Come on, let's go.

847
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:29,390
Harris, you're pretty good right there.

848
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:33,319
Hold it, Harris!

849
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:34,595
He cut my reins.

850
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,877
I'd say he did it on purpose,
and I'm telling you to hold it.

851
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,231
Now just hang your guns over there
on the fence,

852
00:55:44,320 --> 00:55:46,311
and you can pick 'em up when you leave.

853
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:47,719
Hang up your guns.

854
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:57,869
You're pretty good with that gun
when you're sober.

855
00:55:57,960 --> 00:55:59,439
Not bad.

856
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:01,239
How does that happen?

857
00:56:01,320 --> 00:56:04,596
If you mean being good with a gun,
I've had a lot of practice.

858
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:08,470
If you mean being sober,
I'm getting practice on account

859
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,073
of your brother.

860
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,388
I don't follow you.

861
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:13,038
You don't have to follow me.

862
00:56:13,120 --> 00:56:14,155
Matt!

863
00:56:14,840 --> 00:56:17,195
Didn't you hear the boss say
that I was sober?

864
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:20,238
The extra gun in your vest,
lay that on the fence, too.

865
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:25,592
You're enjoying yourself, aren't you?

866
00:56:25,680 --> 00:56:29,514
All right, Mr. Burdette, get going.
I got no more to talk to you about.

867
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,797
You should enjoy it, Dude.

868
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:35,476
Every man should have a little taste
of power before he's through.

869
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:56,189
Stumpy!

870
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:58,478
Burdette and his men are coming in.

871
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:01,074
Don't put down no red carpet for them.

872
00:57:01,200 --> 00:57:03,509
And I'm staying right
where I'm supposed to.

873
00:57:03,600 --> 00:57:04,919
You do that.

874
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,592
Morning, Sheriff.

875
00:57:10,040 --> 00:57:11,359
Hello, Burdette.

876
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:13,718
Been expecting you.

877
00:57:14,160 --> 00:57:15,798
I want to see my brother.

878
00:57:15,880 --> 00:57:17,199
You can come in,

879
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:21,954
but that doesn't mean the rest of you.
He's not your brother.

880
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,236
Go on across the street with the others.

881
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:25,719
Do as he says.

882
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:29,355
What are all those people doing in town?

883
00:57:29,560 --> 00:57:30,959
I didn't ask.

884
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:34,631
Didn't ask 'em to come
or ask 'em why they're here,

885
00:57:35,640 --> 00:57:38,712
but I think they're watching
to see what you're gonna do.

886
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,510
You don't like that, do you?
Too many witnesses.

887
00:57:45,320 --> 00:57:48,392
Now, do you want to keep talking to me
or see your brother?

888
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:50,679
See my brother.

889
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:54,678
We're coming in, Stumpy.

890
00:57:55,080 --> 00:57:58,072
Come ahead.
Don't wait for me to carry you.

891
00:58:05,360 --> 00:58:07,351
All right, Stumpy, open up.

892
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,633
What's the password?

893
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:10,709
Come on.

894
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:13,439
I'm coming. I wouldn't miss this.

895
00:58:13,520 --> 00:58:17,195
Just want him to see how we're set up.
Look who's here.

896
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,710
Place's getting all cluttered up
with Burdettes.

897
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,358
Come right in, Mr. Burdette.

898
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:24,830
That fella round the corner
with a banged-up face is your brother.

899
00:58:24,920 --> 00:58:26,035
Nathan.

900
00:58:26,800 --> 00:58:27,789
Joe.

901
00:58:28,920 --> 00:58:31,115
Looks like they gave you a going over.

902
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:32,713
Our friend here.

903
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,189
Why?

904
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,477
He didn't take too kindly
to being arrested for murder.

905
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,198
It wasn't murder.

906
00:58:40,440 --> 00:58:43,159
If he says it wasn't murder,
why do you say it was?

907
00:58:43,240 --> 00:58:47,119
Man gets shot that's got a gun,
there's room for reasonable doubt.

908
00:58:48,120 --> 00:58:51,271
Man gets shot that hasn't got a gun,
what would you call it?

909
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:55,037
You knew that already, otherwise
you wouldn't have set things up

910
00:58:55,120 --> 00:58:56,519
the way you did.

911
00:58:56,720 --> 00:58:58,153
Just what have I done?

912
00:58:58,240 --> 00:58:59,878
You're a rich man, Burdette.

913
00:58:59,960 --> 00:59:01,154
Big ranch.

914
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,959
Pay a lot of people
to do what you want 'em to do.

915
00:59:04,520 --> 00:59:06,158
And you got a brother.

916
00:59:06,240 --> 00:59:08,674
He's no good, but he's your brother.

917
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:12,875
If he committed 20 murders,
you'd try and see he didn't hang for 'em.

918
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:14,279
I don't like that kind of talk.

919
00:59:14,360 --> 00:59:15,479
Now you're practically
accusing me of...

920
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:18,399
Let's get this straight.
You don't like it.

921
00:59:18,480 --> 00:59:20,277
I don't like a lot of things.

922
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:24,075
I don't like your men sitting
on the road bottling up this town.

923
00:59:24,160 --> 00:59:28,233
I don't like your men watching us,
trying to catch us with our backs turned,

924
00:59:28,320 --> 00:59:31,073
and I don't like it
when a friend of mine offers to help,

925
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:33,196
and 20 minutes later, he's dead,

926
00:59:33,960 --> 00:59:36,997
and I don't like you, Burdette,
because you set it up.

927
00:59:39,640 --> 00:59:41,517
What are you gonna do about it?

928
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,870
I thought you'd get around to that.

929
00:59:45,520 --> 00:59:47,954
I'm gonna sit right here
with your brother in my lap

930
00:59:48,040 --> 00:59:50,759
until the United States Marshal
gets here.

931
00:59:50,840 --> 00:59:52,796
That'll be about six days.

932
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:56,197
He may ask a few questions
about that busted wheel,

933
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,797
but I think you're too smart
to have stopped that stage completely.

934
00:59:59,880 --> 01:00:01,632
Now I'm running out of breath.

935
01:00:01,720 --> 01:00:03,597
You talk if you want to.

936
01:00:04,240 --> 01:00:07,038
He talks awful big
for a man that's all alone

937
01:00:07,240 --> 01:00:09,435
except for a barfly and a cripple.

938
01:00:10,720 --> 01:00:12,073
You can get me out of here any...

939
01:00:12,160 --> 01:00:13,479
Shut up, Joe.

940
01:00:13,840 --> 01:00:16,559
You're not as smart as your brother, Joe.

941
01:00:17,160 --> 01:00:20,994
He sees Stumpy here sitting
around the corner locked in with you,

942
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:24,479
and if that isn't plain enough,
I'll tell you why.

943
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:28,439
If any trouble starts around this jail,
before anybody can get to you,

944
01:00:28,520 --> 01:00:30,909
you're gonna get accidentally shot.

945
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:33,715
I can practical guarantee that.

946
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:37,758
I see you still have a little grudge
against us.

947
01:00:39,120 --> 01:00:42,351
Four hundred and sixty acres
might be little to you, Nathan,

948
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:44,632
but it was a lot of country to me.

949
01:00:44,720 --> 01:00:48,395
Don't take no chances, Nathan.
He looks just crazy enough to shoot me.

950
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,712
He's smarter than I thought.

951
01:00:51,880 --> 01:00:54,633
You know,
a court might just call that murder, too.

952
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,830
What's the difference?

953
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,797
We'd all be dead by then.

954
01:00:59,040 --> 01:01:01,190
You got anything else you want to say?

955
01:01:01,800 --> 01:01:04,951
Just one thing. Joe has friends.

956
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:08,075
You can't hold Joe
or me responsible for them,

957
01:01:08,160 --> 01:01:10,879
what you say they've done
or what they might do.

958
01:01:11,320 --> 01:01:12,878
I want to make that clear.

959
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:14,678
I'll help you make it clear.

960
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:17,360
I don't think
Joe's got a friend in the world,

961
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:21,513
and he won't have any unless somebody
buys 'em for him at $50 a head,

962
01:01:21,960 --> 01:01:24,235
like the fella that shot Wheeler.

963
01:01:25,840 --> 01:01:27,432
You made it clear.

964
01:01:27,760 --> 01:01:28,954
All right, Stumpy.

965
01:01:29,040 --> 01:01:30,075
Nathan.

966
01:01:30,160 --> 01:01:31,195
Just sit tight, Joe.

967
01:01:31,280 --> 01:01:32,918
Send me a bottle before you leave town.

968
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,549
You do that 'cause part of my job
is to see that it ain't poisoned.

969
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,439
Sometimes it takes quite a spell
to find out.

970
01:01:44,080 --> 01:01:45,638
He didn't have much to say, did he?

971
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:46,869
No.

972
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,671
What did you leave him go for?
You had plenty to hold him on.

973
01:01:54,840 --> 01:01:57,149
Anything they're gonna do
is planned already,

974
01:01:57,240 --> 01:01:58,798
or he wouldn't have come in here.

975
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:02,316
Throwing him with Joe'd just give him
an alibi for whatever happens.

976
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:03,594
I never thought of that.

977
01:02:03,680 --> 01:02:05,716
- What do you think is gonna happen?
- I don't know.

978
01:02:05,800 --> 01:02:07,597
You can think, can't you?

979
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,948
I think I told you to get back in there
and stay with that door locked.

980
01:02:12,040 --> 01:02:14,508
You be careful how you talk to me, now.
You hear what Joe said.

981
01:02:14,600 --> 01:02:17,876
You're alone, excepting for a barfly
and an old cripple.

982
01:02:17,960 --> 01:02:21,748
Calling me an old cripple.
I like hearing you say that, Joe.

983
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,595
I gotta fix your supper for you tonight.

984
01:02:28,600 --> 01:02:29,589
<i>Seor</i> Chance.

985
01:02:29,800 --> 01:02:30,835
<i>Seor</i> Chance.

986
01:02:30,920 --> 01:02:32,353
It's me, Carlos.

987
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:33,714
Come on in.

988
01:02:34,200 --> 01:02:35,269
What do you want?

989
01:02:35,360 --> 01:02:36,634
I want to talk to you.

990
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:38,119
Did the girl...

991
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:40,638
What happened to your eye?

992
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:42,711
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

993
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,677
She did that? What'd you do?

994
01:02:44,760 --> 01:02:47,194
- She did not do it.
- I thought you said she did.

995
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:49,619
I say you tell me to put her
on the stage.

996
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:51,159
Consuela, she hit me in the eye.

997
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:52,419
I'm a little mixed up.

998
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,198
Please, <i>seor</i>, do not talk.
I tell you.

999
01:02:54,280 --> 01:02:55,838
- Go ahead.
- It is better if I tell you.

1000
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,273
You told me to put the lady on the stage.

1001
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,475
- Right.
- The stage she's ready,

1002
01:02:58,560 --> 01:02:59,788
- but she don't come down.
- What?

1003
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:02,110
I yell at her, "Come down."
She said she ain't coming.

1004
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:03,680
I go up and get her.
She said she don't go.

1005
01:03:03,781 --> 01:03:04,760
Did she go?

1006
01:03:04,840 --> 01:03:07,434
I tell her you say go.
I tell her I am responsible.

1007
01:03:07,520 --> 01:03:10,557
She say, no, she is responsible,
and I said that may be,

1008
01:03:10,640 --> 01:03:11,755
and I pick her up.

1009
01:03:11,840 --> 01:03:13,831
Then Consuela say,
"What are you doing with that woman?"

1010
01:03:13,920 --> 01:03:15,353
And I say I take her to the stage.

1011
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,237
The woman said
she don't want to go on the stage.

1012
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:18,799
- Did she go on the stage?
- Please!

1013
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,190
Consuela tell me, "Put her down."
I said I am responsible.

1014
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:25,272
Consuela thinks that mean
something else, so she give me this eye.

1015
01:03:25,360 --> 01:03:26,429
What'd you do?

1016
01:03:26,520 --> 01:03:29,239
Do? What can I do?
My arms is full of the lady.

1017
01:03:29,320 --> 01:03:31,276
I can do nothing.
I drop her on the floor.

1018
01:03:31,277 --> 01:03:33,233
She yells, and she says
I tried to kill her.

1019
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:35,117
Did the girl get on the stage?

1020
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,794
No, she did not go,
but Jake says he couldn't wait.

1021
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:39,518
- Why?
- He says he must leave.

1022
01:03:39,600 --> 01:03:42,068
I mean the girl.
Did she say why she wasn't going?

1023
01:03:42,160 --> 01:03:45,072
No, she didn't say.
How can I know if she don't say?

1024
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:48,755
Please come and tell Consuela
what "responsible" means.

1025
01:03:48,840 --> 01:03:50,398
Stumpy, we're going out.

1026
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:53,392
Fine. I like to be left alone.
I'm getting used to it.

1027
01:04:01,760 --> 01:04:03,239
The door's unlocked.

1028
01:04:09,600 --> 01:04:11,318
I didn't go.

1029
01:04:11,680 --> 01:04:13,159
I can see that.

1030
01:04:13,800 --> 01:04:18,237
I don't know.
I had everything all packed,

1031
01:04:18,320 --> 01:04:20,515
then Carlos yelled the stage was ready,

1032
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,319
and I heard somebody saying
they weren't going.

1033
01:04:24,400 --> 01:04:26,072
It was me saying it.

1034
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,472
And you want to know why I didn't go,
don't you, Sheriff?

1035
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,153
What's your name, anyway?
I don't even know that.

1036
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:35,992
Chance, John T.

1037
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,713
T for trouble.

1038
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,074
I always make you mad, don't I, John T?

1039
01:04:42,520 --> 01:04:45,034
Then don't make me tell you why I stayed.

1040
01:04:47,400 --> 01:04:48,976
I won't make it any harder for you.

1041
01:04:49,177 --> 01:04:51,552
I won't get in your way.
I'll just be here.

1042
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:54,632
You don't owe me a thing,

1043
01:04:54,840 --> 01:04:57,149
and you won't owe me when it's all over.

1044
01:04:57,880 --> 01:05:00,599
When that happens,
just tell me to go, and I'll go.

1045
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:05,229
No, you won't even have to tell me.

1046
01:05:05,960 --> 01:05:08,110
I'll know by then, and I'll just go.

1047
01:05:09,240 --> 01:05:10,992
Is that fair, John T?

1048
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,513
You don't have to answer me now
if you don't want to,

1049
01:05:20,120 --> 01:05:23,590
but just say something.

1050
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:28,753
If I weren't in this mess,
it might be different,

1051
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:30,994
but I am.

1052
01:05:32,360 --> 01:05:34,112
That's all I wanted to hear.

1053
01:05:53,920 --> 01:05:56,070
I'm glad we tried it a second time.

1054
01:05:56,920 --> 01:05:58,956
It's better when two people do it.

1055
01:06:01,400 --> 01:06:03,072
I've kept you long enough.

1056
01:06:03,800 --> 01:06:06,189
You'd better run along now
and do your job.

1057
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:04,955
Hi, Chance.

1058
01:08:05,040 --> 01:08:07,076
It's getting too dark
to do any good out there.

1059
01:08:07,160 --> 01:08:08,718
Just be a sitting duck.

1060
01:08:09,360 --> 01:08:11,430
Anything happen when Burdette left?

1061
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:13,317
Nice as pie. Didn't say a word.

1062
01:08:13,400 --> 01:08:14,992
What was the shot when they came in?

1063
01:08:15,080 --> 01:08:17,310
That gunslinger of his was on the prod.

1064
01:08:17,400 --> 01:08:18,389
What'd he do?

1065
01:08:18,480 --> 01:08:21,153
Nothing, just grunted and growled,
made a few faces.

1066
01:08:21,360 --> 01:08:22,475
Took care of that.

1067
01:08:22,560 --> 01:08:23,629
What happened here?

1068
01:08:23,720 --> 01:08:24,914
Not much.

1069
01:08:26,720 --> 01:08:29,359
That tune, they been playing it all day.

1070
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:30,839
What is it?

1071
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:34,118
It's some Mexican piece.
I heard it farther south.

1072
01:08:35,640 --> 01:08:37,153
Evening, Sheriff.

1073
01:08:37,280 --> 01:08:39,316
Colorado. What do you want?

1074
01:08:39,680 --> 01:08:41,272
Just curious again.

1075
01:08:41,360 --> 01:08:43,316
How'd you come out with Burdette?

1076
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:45,231
He wanted to talk to his brother.

1077
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:46,514
What'd he have to say?

1078
01:08:46,600 --> 01:08:47,669
Nothing.

1079
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:49,359
You mean, he didn't say anything?

1080
01:08:49,440 --> 01:08:51,078
Why are you so interested?

1081
01:08:51,280 --> 01:08:53,236
Because he's talking now.

1082
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:54,919
Hear that music?

1083
01:08:55,040 --> 01:08:56,758
He told the man to play it.

1084
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,149
What is it?

1085
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:02,038
They call it the <i>Degello</i>,
the cutthroat song.

1086
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:04,156
The Mexicans played it
for those Texas boys

1087
01:09:04,240 --> 01:09:06,037
when they had 'em bottled up
in the Alamo.

1088
01:09:06,120 --> 01:09:08,588
Played it day and night
till it was all over.

1089
01:09:09,680 --> 01:09:11,750
Now do you know what he means by it?

1090
01:09:11,840 --> 01:09:13,114
No quarter.

1091
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:15,791
No mercy for the losers.

1092
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:17,239
You'll be hearing a lot of it.

1093
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,436
I guess we made him talk, after all.

1094
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:22,309
Just thought you'd like to know, Sheriff.

1095
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:20,309
Stumpy!

1096
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:21,435
What?

1097
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,317
They don't need any help with that tune.

1098
01:10:23,400 --> 01:10:25,994
What's the matter?
Is it getting through to you?

1099
01:10:32,920 --> 01:10:35,559
By the way, the stage got off all right.

1100
01:10:37,400 --> 01:10:39,630
I watched it clear through the valley.

1101
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:44,158
About six days
till the Marshal will get here.

1102
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,878
That's what I figured.

1103
01:10:49,480 --> 01:10:51,596
The girl wasn't on the stage.

1104
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,273
I know that.

1105
01:10:57,440 --> 01:10:59,078
Tell her she could stay?

1106
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:00,594
No, she...

1107
01:11:02,200 --> 01:11:04,270
Yes, I did. What about it?

1108
01:11:04,440 --> 01:11:06,078
Nothing, nothing at all.

1109
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:07,912
You were going to say something.

1110
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,718
I remembered in time.

1111
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:14,993
I remembered another girl came through
on a stage that stopped over.

1112
01:11:16,160 --> 01:11:18,355
I remember you told me she was no good.

1113
01:11:19,280 --> 01:11:21,589
I didn't believe you, but you were right,

1114
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,070
so naturally, I figured you're an expert,

1115
01:11:24,160 --> 01:11:26,833
and you know just what you're doing
all the time.

1116
01:11:28,080 --> 01:11:30,469
I just hope
you have better luck than I had.

1117
01:11:33,000 --> 01:11:36,515
You know, that's the first time
I've been able to laugh about that.

1118
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:38,392
Maybe there's some hope for me yet.

1119
01:11:38,480 --> 01:11:39,708
Maybe,

1120
01:11:39,800 --> 01:11:40,869
but I doubt it.

1121
01:11:40,960 --> 01:11:44,396
That's what I like about you.
You're such an encouraging...

1122
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:48,437
If you go by the hotel,
pick up some coffee and sugar, will you?

1123
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:49,794
Joe complaining?

1124
01:11:49,880 --> 01:11:51,552
Him? He don't get no sugar.

1125
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:53,995
His coffee's just water
poured over the old grounds.

1126
01:11:54,080 --> 01:11:56,036
I'll learn him to talk out of turn.

1127
01:11:56,120 --> 01:11:59,056
Before I forget,
your gun's a little stiff.

1128
01:11:59,057 --> 01:12:00,193
You mind if I file the action a bit?

1129
01:12:00,280 --> 01:12:02,475
No! I don't want you to file no action
on my gun.

1130
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,551
I don't want no easy pull.
I might shoot myself.

1131
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:06,312
Get somebody else's.

1132
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,550
Why don't you give him his own guns?

1133
01:12:09,680 --> 01:12:10,908
I forgot all about 'em.

1134
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:12,638
Your memory ain't no better than mine.

1135
01:12:12,720 --> 01:12:14,233
They been locked up in there now
for over a year,

1136
01:12:14,320 --> 01:12:16,959
excepting when you took 'em out
to clean 'em and oil 'em.

1137
01:12:24,960 --> 01:12:26,598
Where'd you get these?

1138
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:29,713
Bought 'em off the fella you sold 'em to.

1139
01:12:32,360 --> 01:12:33,634
I didn't...

1140
01:12:35,720 --> 01:12:37,199
I don't know how to...

1141
01:12:38,160 --> 01:12:41,789
Let's take a turn around the town.
Get Stumpy his coffee.

1142
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,110
Ain't you gonna tell me
to get back in there?

1143
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:47,192
No, stay out here and get shot.

1144
01:12:47,280 --> 01:12:49,191
I might do that just for spite.

1145
01:12:49,440 --> 01:12:51,271
Might get a laugh out of you.

1146
01:12:52,000 --> 01:12:54,309
What I put up with for $30 a month.

1147
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:14,154
Feels good.

1148
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:15,389
Come on.

1149
01:13:15,680 --> 01:13:17,796
By the way, am I drawing pay?

1150
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:19,428
Same as before.

1151
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:22,114
In that case, you can take out
what you gave for these guns.

1152
01:13:22,200 --> 01:13:23,394
No hurry.

1153
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:26,559
If you're feeling so generous,
I could use an advance.

1154
01:13:26,640 --> 01:13:30,315
Buy a new pair of pants, new shirt,
something without all these holes in it.

1155
01:13:30,400 --> 01:13:31,515
No need of that.

1156
01:13:31,600 --> 01:13:34,876
When you lit out,
you left some things behind.

1157
01:13:35,120 --> 01:13:36,917
I got 'em at the hotel.

1158
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:39,750
You been keeping 'em all this time?

1159
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:42,755
Been waiting till they fit you again.

1160
01:13:45,080 --> 01:13:48,277
You could use a bath and a shave, too.

1161
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,710
I don't know about the shave.
I'm liable to cut my own throat.

1162
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:54,589
Chance?

1163
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:55,995
Yeah?

1164
01:13:56,240 --> 01:13:57,434
They'll fit.

1165
01:13:58,200 --> 01:13:59,349
Thanks.

1166
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:30,708
There you are.

1167
01:14:37,120 --> 01:14:38,917
How about you, John T?

1168
01:14:39,200 --> 01:14:40,792
Shall I work on you?

1169
01:14:41,000 --> 01:14:42,718
I do my own shaving.

1170
01:14:43,400 --> 01:14:44,753
I thought you did.

1171
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:47,031
I was just reminding you.

1172
01:14:53,640 --> 01:14:55,710
Sure buy a lot of drinks with that.

1173
01:14:58,160 --> 01:14:59,388
You sure could.

1174
01:15:02,320 --> 01:15:04,072
I'll let you keep it for me.

1175
01:15:05,880 --> 01:15:09,236
Feathers, thanks for the shave.
Might call on you again.

1176
01:15:09,320 --> 01:15:11,231
Any time because I'll be here.

1177
01:15:11,400 --> 01:15:14,278
I didn't tell you, John T.
Carlos is giving me a job.

1178
01:15:14,720 --> 01:15:15,709
Good for Carlos.

1179
01:15:15,800 --> 01:15:17,870
Shall we take Stumpy
his coffee and things?

1180
01:15:17,960 --> 01:15:20,520
You in a hurry, John T?
I'd like to talk to you for a minute.

1181
01:15:20,600 --> 01:15:21,749
I'll wait for you.

1182
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:23,239
Thanks, Dude.

1183
01:15:23,960 --> 01:15:26,394
- I just wanted to ask you...
- What's this about a job?

1184
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:30,234
Carlos says he's not sleeping very well.
Says I can help out downstairs.

1185
01:15:30,800 --> 01:15:32,119
Tending bar?

1186
01:15:32,240 --> 01:15:33,878
Among other things.

1187
01:15:34,200 --> 01:15:36,395
You think I shouldn't?

1188
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:37,789
Why ask me?

1189
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,632
The way you said, "Tending bar."

1190
01:15:40,280 --> 01:15:42,510
- All right, I won't do it.
- I didn't say not to.

1191
01:15:42,600 --> 01:15:43,874
You don't like the idea.

1192
01:15:43,960 --> 01:15:46,030
Why should it be up to me?
Why should I care?

1193
01:15:46,120 --> 01:15:48,350
I don't know why you get mad
when I ask you.

1194
01:15:48,440 --> 01:15:50,510
- I'm not mad.
- You're not?

1195
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:53,353
- You'd make anybody mad.
- I suppose I would.

1196
01:15:53,760 --> 01:15:57,719
As long as you haven't anything
against it, I'll take the job.

1197
01:15:58,120 --> 01:15:59,155
Go ahead.

1198
01:15:59,240 --> 01:16:00,719
Thanks, I will.

1199
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:03,793
What were you gonna ask me?

1200
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:05,677
Never mind. You're in too bad a humor.

1201
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,273
What were you going to ask?

1202
01:16:07,360 --> 01:16:09,874
Whether you were going to sleep here
in the hotel tonight.

1203
01:16:09,960 --> 01:16:11,109
Get one thing straight.

1204
01:16:11,200 --> 01:16:13,555
There'll be no more chair-sitting
outside this door.

1205
01:16:13,640 --> 01:16:15,392
I know. I've given that up.

1206
01:16:15,480 --> 01:16:19,155
Anyway, I have a better idea.
Tonight you sleep in my room.

1207
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:21,231
Anyone looking for you
wouldn't look there first.

1208
01:16:21,320 --> 01:16:23,709
You'd have more time
if anything did happen.

1209
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:27,670
Besides, I have a rocking chair.
It's more comfortable.

1210
01:16:28,760 --> 01:16:31,274
Just an idea. You can think about it

1211
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:34,310
when you're in a little better humor.

1212
01:16:44,080 --> 01:16:45,798
Chance! <i>Seor</i> Chance!

1213
01:16:46,000 --> 01:16:47,752
The shot came from the jail.

1214
01:16:58,400 --> 01:16:59,515
Chance, look out!

1215
01:16:59,600 --> 01:17:01,079
Don't go in there.

1216
01:17:01,200 --> 01:17:03,270
That idiot just took a shot at me.

1217
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:05,877
Stumpy! You all right?

1218
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:10,155
Sure I am, but there's a feller out
there with a black hat that ain't.

1219
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:11,679
And I'm that fella.

1220
01:17:14,200 --> 01:17:15,474
Coming in.

1221
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,632
Look what he did to my hat.

1222
01:17:21,200 --> 01:17:23,031
Stumpy, that was Dude you shot at.

1223
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:26,317
Dude? I didn't know.
Didn't look like Dude.

1224
01:17:26,400 --> 01:17:28,038
Fool almost blowed my head off.

1225
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:29,235
How'd I know it was you?

1226
01:17:29,320 --> 01:17:31,595
You get yourself all dolled up
like Astor's pet horse

1227
01:17:31,680 --> 01:17:35,036
and then stick your nose in that door
and don't say nothing.

1228
01:17:35,120 --> 01:17:36,394
Look at this hat.

1229
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:38,869
If you hadn't ducked, that's
what your head would've looked like.

1230
01:17:38,960 --> 01:17:41,190
I never would've fired
if I knew it was you.

1231
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,669
Okay, I know.
Just stop talking, will you?

1232
01:17:43,920 --> 01:17:46,309
The shot didn't bother me.
I've been shot at before.

1233
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:47,753
You could've hollered.

1234
01:17:47,840 --> 01:17:49,671
Just 'cause you get cleaned up
don't mean you can't talk.

1235
01:17:49,760 --> 01:17:51,113
You didn't get your tonsils washed out.

1236
01:17:51,200 --> 01:17:54,397
Okay, it's my fault. I should've yelled.
I shouldn't have taken a bath.

1237
01:17:54,480 --> 01:17:56,948
Just stop talking. Just let it be.

1238
01:17:57,040 --> 01:17:59,349
You been going around here for
the last couple of years like something

1239
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,296
the cat dragged in,
and now you expect...

1240
01:18:01,331 --> 01:18:02,300
Shut up!

1241
01:18:04,760 --> 01:18:07,593
I told you, Stumpy, I've had it.

1242
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,392
Don't let me tell you again.

1243
01:18:26,440 --> 01:18:28,829
You're getting a little touchy,
aren't you?

1244
01:18:29,040 --> 01:18:31,918
I've been listening
to that old fool talk until I'm...

1245
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:34,833
All right, I'm wrong.

1246
01:18:34,920 --> 01:18:37,798
That old fool is talking
because he nearly killed you.

1247
01:18:37,880 --> 01:18:39,871
He's the one that's scared.

1248
01:18:41,080 --> 01:18:43,116
We've been pampering you too much.

1249
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:45,876
You better get some sleep.

1250
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:58,109
You know, he acts like
I done it a-purpose, and I didn't.

1251
01:18:58,280 --> 01:18:59,918
You see that door there?

1252
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:02,430
That look like I done it a-purpose?

1253
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:05,156
It's gonna get cold here at night,

1254
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:08,869
and I'm gonna leave it get cold
'cause I ain't a-gonna fix that door.

1255
01:19:11,440 --> 01:19:13,158
It weren't my fault.

1256
01:19:14,920 --> 01:19:16,035
Were it?

1257
01:19:21,680 --> 01:19:22,715
I know.

1258
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:26,473
I'll fix the door.

1259
01:19:40,560 --> 01:19:42,118
Hiya, Sheriff.

1260
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,872
How do you like your new job?

1261
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:56,710
They've been keeping me pretty busy.

1262
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:00,588
You through for the day? Going to bed?

1263
01:20:00,680 --> 01:20:01,999
I thought I would.

1264
01:20:02,160 --> 01:20:04,230
- Can I make you some coffee?
- No, thanks.

1265
01:20:04,320 --> 01:20:05,833
- Anything to eat?
- Nope.

1266
01:20:05,920 --> 01:20:07,239
How about a drink?

1267
01:20:08,520 --> 01:20:10,112
I'll take a drink.

1268
01:20:11,160 --> 01:20:13,754
Carlos says this is for special guests.

1269
01:20:14,880 --> 01:20:16,711
Tired, aren't you, John T?

1270
01:20:18,040 --> 01:20:19,996
I can fix you a nice hot bath.

1271
01:20:20,080 --> 01:20:21,798
All I want is that drink.

1272
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:26,036
Then this is all I can do for you?

1273
01:20:28,000 --> 01:20:30,116
I thought you said
I could think about it.

1274
01:20:30,200 --> 01:20:32,509
You're right. I did.

1275
01:20:33,880 --> 01:20:35,472
Put it on the tab.

1276
01:20:36,160 --> 01:20:38,879
In case you make up your mind,
I left my door open.

1277
01:20:42,560 --> 01:20:44,471
Get a good night's sleep.

1278
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,516
You're not helping me any.

1279
01:22:40,440 --> 01:22:41,714
Morning, Dude.

1280
01:22:42,240 --> 01:22:43,389
Good morning.

1281
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:44,833
Have a good night?

1282
01:22:45,400 --> 01:22:46,594
All right, I guess.

1283
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:47,954
Eat anything?

1284
01:22:48,280 --> 01:22:49,679
- No, I...
- This morning?

1285
01:22:50,720 --> 01:22:51,994
Stumpy fixed something.

1286
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:54,878
I asked you a question.
You didn't answer it.

1287
01:22:55,080 --> 01:22:58,755
All right, I'll answer you.
I didn't sleep good, didn't eat anything.

1288
01:22:58,840 --> 01:23:00,751
I had a beer, and it didn't do any good.

1289
01:23:00,840 --> 01:23:02,398
Think you can stand your watch?

1290
01:23:02,480 --> 01:23:04,755
When I can't do that, I'll let you know.

1291
01:24:03,960 --> 01:24:05,712
- Take the vest off.
- Yeah.

1292
01:24:05,880 --> 01:24:07,438
Where's his hat?

1293
01:24:13,640 --> 01:24:16,712
Get out there. We'll be along
as soon as we get him tied.

1294
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:31,031
Stumpy, did Dude have a bad night?

1295
01:24:31,160 --> 01:24:33,196
He's suffering thunderation, Chance.

1296
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,838
His mind's just beginning
to work again now,

1297
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:37,559
and he sees what he done to himself.

1298
01:24:38,240 --> 01:24:39,639
Ain't pretty.

1299
01:24:40,240 --> 01:24:41,878
He's gotta sweat it out,

1300
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:45,029
and don't let him cry
on your shoulder, either.

1301
01:24:45,120 --> 01:24:46,348
He ain't done it yet.

1302
01:24:46,440 --> 01:24:49,113
Why are you so goll-darned ornery?
Always picking on Dude.

1303
01:24:49,200 --> 01:24:52,317
- Stumpy, you got any tobacco?
- No, I give the last there was to Dude.

1304
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:54,755
He uses it up fast.
You gotta get some for yourself,

1305
01:24:54,840 --> 01:24:57,673
but what I'm asking you is,
why're you picking on Dude?

1306
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:01,514
All right, be nice to him, and then
he'll fall apart in small pieces.

1307
01:25:01,760 --> 01:25:03,990
Maybe you're right.
You know him better than I do.

1308
01:25:04,080 --> 01:25:07,675
I guess some folks is built that way,
but that wouldn't work with me.

1309
01:25:08,000 --> 01:25:10,639
You could at least have
a kind word for me now and then,

1310
01:25:10,720 --> 01:25:12,711
considering what I have to do
around here.

1311
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:14,358
The sweeping and the cooking

1312
01:25:14,440 --> 01:25:17,034
and the nursemaiding
that killer back there.

1313
01:25:17,560 --> 01:25:19,710
Not even a thank you do I get.

1314
01:25:19,920 --> 01:25:21,638
Maybe you're right, Stumpy.

1315
01:25:22,480 --> 01:25:24,914
- You're a treasure.
- Well...

1316
01:25:25,880 --> 01:25:28,394
- I don't know what I'd do without you.
- Well, I...

1317
01:25:30,400 --> 01:25:31,913
Go back to being yourself.

1318
01:25:32,000 --> 01:25:33,752
Leastwise I'm used to that.

1319
01:26:08,160 --> 01:26:10,116
He's coming down the street now.

1320
01:26:14,240 --> 01:26:15,593
Morning, Sheriff.

1321
01:26:16,160 --> 01:26:17,354
Colorado.

1322
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:20,478
I been hearing a lot of talk.
Thought you might be interested.

1323
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:21,675
About what?

1324
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:24,553
Mostly about you telling Burdette
what would happen to Joe

1325
01:26:24,640 --> 01:26:26,278
if trouble started around the jail.

1326
01:26:27,080 --> 01:26:30,436
Guess he didn't expect to hear that.
Kind of new to me, too.

1327
01:26:30,520 --> 01:26:31,919
Would you have said it any different?

1328
01:26:32,000 --> 01:26:33,115
No.

1329
01:26:33,200 --> 01:26:34,474
If he was doing to me
what he's doing to you,

1330
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:36,073
I'd tell him the same thing.

1331
01:26:36,160 --> 01:26:38,879
Besides, he can't take a chance
on whether you'd really do it or not.

1332
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:40,598
I don't suppose so.

1333
01:26:40,680 --> 01:26:43,592
But you can be sure
he's gonna try it a different way.

1334
01:26:43,720 --> 01:26:45,517
Got enough left there for another?

1335
01:26:45,600 --> 01:26:47,272
Sure. Help yourself.

1336
01:26:48,320 --> 01:26:50,311
You always keep that carbine cocked?

1337
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:52,072
Only when I carry it.

1338
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:54,632
How come you carry a rifle?

1339
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,551
I found some were faster than me
with a short gun.

1340
01:27:02,920 --> 01:27:05,195
I don't suppose you have a match, either?

1341
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:06,913
All out of them, too.

1342
01:27:07,160 --> 01:27:08,354
I'll get some.

1343
01:27:17,480 --> 01:27:20,358
Sheriff, we ran into some trouble
on the road.

1344
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,510
Al here is hurt. His horse threw him.

1345
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,875
Your deputy said we could find a doctor.

1346
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:26,598
Round the corner.

1347
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,110
About three or four doors to the right.

1348
01:27:29,200 --> 01:27:31,236
Stay away from that rifle, Sheriff.

1349
01:27:31,400 --> 01:27:33,118
You can see we've still got our guns.

1350
01:27:33,200 --> 01:27:35,350
That ain't your deputy up the street.

1351
01:27:35,480 --> 01:27:37,118
Unloosen that belt.

1352
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:41,629
What've you done to him?

1353
01:27:41,720 --> 01:27:43,039
Don't worry about him.

1354
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:44,997
Worry about yourself. He's all right.

1355
01:27:45,080 --> 01:27:48,152
He ain't gonna be and neither are you
unless you do as you're told.

1356
01:27:48,240 --> 01:27:49,309
Stay back here.

1357
01:27:49,400 --> 01:27:50,799
We're going down to the jail.

1358
01:27:50,880 --> 01:27:52,518
You're gonna turn Joe Burdette loose,

1359
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:55,797
or you and your deputy are gonna quit
worrying about this whole thing.

1360
01:27:55,880 --> 01:27:57,199
Take your choice.

1361
01:27:57,320 --> 01:27:59,151
Are you just gonna stand here?

1362
01:27:59,720 --> 01:28:02,234
If you want to get him shot,
just go out there.

1363
01:28:02,520 --> 01:28:03,953
What'll it be?

1364
01:28:06,560 --> 01:28:09,870
If you want to do something,
when I get out on the porch in the clear,

1365
01:28:09,960 --> 01:28:12,349
take that flower pot
and throw it through the window,

1366
01:28:12,440 --> 01:28:14,476
and duck after you throw it.

1367
01:28:21,480 --> 01:28:23,391
Just keep coming, mister.

1368
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,950
- Who, me?
- Yes, you.

1369
01:28:43,640 --> 01:28:44,959
Grab that horse.

1370
01:28:51,880 --> 01:28:53,233
Colorado, where's he going?

1371
01:28:53,320 --> 01:28:54,594
He's gonna see if Dude's all right.

1372
01:29:08,120 --> 01:29:09,473
Chance, over here.

1373
01:29:16,360 --> 01:29:18,112
You look a little used.

1374
01:29:18,240 --> 01:29:20,276
What'd they do? I heard shooting.

1375
01:29:20,520 --> 01:29:21,794
They had me cold.

1376
01:29:21,880 --> 01:29:23,598
Gonna make me open the jail.

1377
01:29:23,880 --> 01:29:25,074
What happened?

1378
01:29:25,840 --> 01:29:28,070
I didn't have to. Colorado helped me.

1379
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:31,072
If you'd have had him here,
this wouldn't have happened.

1380
01:29:31,160 --> 01:29:32,957
I can get up by myself!

1381
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:35,279
I let 'em get me.

1382
01:29:35,480 --> 01:29:38,756
I let 'em walk right up an stick my head
in the water trough,

1383
01:29:38,840 --> 01:29:40,671
and it was easy for 'em.

1384
01:29:42,920 --> 01:29:45,480
I'm good when I'm sober, boy, real good.

1385
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,552
I should've known better,

1386
01:29:48,640 --> 01:29:52,155
a man ought to have sense enough
to know when he's no good no more.

1387
01:29:52,440 --> 01:29:54,635
- Where are you going?
- Get your hands off of me.

1388
01:29:54,720 --> 01:29:55,948
I said, where are you going?

1389
01:29:56,040 --> 01:29:58,873
You've got no use
for a man you can't depend on.

1390
01:29:59,080 --> 01:30:01,036
One bad night, and I'm done for.

1391
01:30:01,760 --> 01:30:04,911
An old man takes a potshot at me,
and I'm finished.

1392
01:30:05,480 --> 01:30:08,472
I tried and I tried hard,
and where did it get me?

1393
01:30:08,560 --> 01:30:09,629
Look at me.

1394
01:30:10,040 --> 01:30:11,598
I got 'em so bad.

1395
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:14,635
What can a man do with hands like that?

1396
01:30:15,560 --> 01:30:18,279
I'm through. I quit, John. I quit.

1397
01:30:18,360 --> 01:30:19,873
All right, quit.

1398
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:22,192
Nobody's trying to stop you.

1399
01:30:22,280 --> 01:30:24,191
If you want to quit, quit.

1400
01:30:24,280 --> 01:30:26,430
Go on back to the bottle. Get drunk.

1401
01:30:26,600 --> 01:30:28,033
One thing, though.

1402
01:30:28,120 --> 01:30:32,750
Somebody throws a dollar in a spittoon,
don't expect me to do something about it.

1403
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,873
Just get down on your knees
and go after it.

1404
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,638
I'm sorry.

1405
01:30:40,680 --> 01:30:42,830
Sorry don't get it done, Dude.

1406
01:30:43,240 --> 01:30:46,755
That's the second time you hit me.
Don't ever do it again.

1407
01:30:48,480 --> 01:30:49,879
Maybe you're right.

1408
01:30:50,920 --> 01:30:53,036
Maybe you aren't much good anymore.

1409
01:30:57,680 --> 01:30:59,272
Here are your guns.

1410
01:31:00,640 --> 01:31:03,154
Fella that took your hat
must've left this.

1411
01:31:03,240 --> 01:31:04,992
You get something out of it.

1412
01:31:06,040 --> 01:31:09,669
Now come on down to the jail,
and I'll give the money you got coming.

1413
01:31:15,880 --> 01:31:17,632
I think this is your horse, <i>seor</i>.

1414
01:31:17,720 --> 01:31:19,392
Yeah, that's mine. Thanks.

1415
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:21,952
I guess Dude's all right.

1416
01:31:22,040 --> 01:31:23,393
Anyway, he's walking.

1417
01:31:23,480 --> 01:31:24,799
I'm so glad.

1418
01:31:25,200 --> 01:31:26,599
I was afraid.

1419
01:31:27,880 --> 01:31:29,074
My stomach seems...

1420
01:31:29,160 --> 01:31:31,355
Come on, maybe a drink will help.

1421
01:31:44,520 --> 01:31:46,909
Go on up to the jail,
and wait for me there.

1422
01:31:48,680 --> 01:31:50,910
Tell Stumpy to give you a drink.

1423
01:31:56,640 --> 01:31:57,755
<i>Seor</i> Chance.

1424
01:31:57,840 --> 01:32:00,957
What do you wish me to do
with this three dead men?

1425
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:03,389
You're the undertaker, Burt. Bury 'em.

1426
01:32:03,560 --> 01:32:05,152
There's another one down by the bridge.

1427
01:32:05,240 --> 01:32:07,390
Send in your bill,
and the county will pay you.

1428
01:32:07,480 --> 01:32:08,549
No need for that.

1429
01:32:08,640 --> 01:32:12,155
Each one of them had
two new $50 gold pieces in his pocket.

1430
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:13,468
Price is going up.

1431
01:32:13,560 --> 01:32:14,595
What?

1432
01:32:14,680 --> 01:32:15,954
Nothing, Burt.

1433
01:32:16,200 --> 01:32:18,589
Bring their guns and other stuff
to the jail.

1434
01:32:18,680 --> 01:32:19,795
It will be done.

1435
01:32:19,880 --> 01:32:21,472
Here is your gun, <i>seor</i>.

1436
01:32:21,560 --> 01:32:23,232
Thank you, Carlitos.

1437
01:32:23,720 --> 01:32:24,994
Where's Colorado?

1438
01:32:25,080 --> 01:32:27,753
He is inside the hotel.
He took the girl Feathers.

1439
01:32:29,600 --> 01:32:31,591
Better give me another, Colorado.

1440
01:32:32,120 --> 01:32:33,189
Yes, ma'am.

1441
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:36,431
Look at me, Colorado. Take a good look.

1442
01:32:37,040 --> 01:32:40,316
Would you say my head is soft?
Would you say I'm an idiot?

1443
01:32:40,840 --> 01:32:41,909
No, ma'am.

1444
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:44,158
You'd be a liar, then.

1445
01:32:45,520 --> 01:32:47,238
Better go easy on that stuff.

1446
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:48,435
That makes three you've had.

1447
01:32:48,520 --> 01:32:49,589
Yep,

1448
01:32:49,800 --> 01:32:52,155
you'd be lying because that's what I am,

1449
01:32:52,400 --> 01:32:54,072
a softheaded idiot.

1450
01:32:54,400 --> 01:32:57,915
There isn't any other explanation
for staying around here

1451
01:32:58,040 --> 01:33:00,793
and inviting myself into this.
He told me...

1452
01:33:04,840 --> 01:33:05,909
Hi, Sheriff.

1453
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:08,514
We saw you coming back.
Dude was all right, wasn't he?

1454
01:33:08,600 --> 01:33:11,751
He's all right. So am I, thanks to you.

1455
01:33:12,400 --> 01:33:13,456
Thank the lady here.

1456
01:33:13,457 --> 01:33:16,313
Sure, thank the lady.
She did a big thing.

1457
01:33:16,400 --> 01:33:18,197
She threw a flower pot
through the window

1458
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:20,032
and helped get three men killed,

1459
01:33:20,680 --> 01:33:22,159
or was it four?

1460
01:33:22,440 --> 01:33:23,873
Why did you make me do it?

1461
01:33:23,960 --> 01:33:26,713
- I made you do it?
- Sure, you did. Didn't he, Colorado?

1462
01:33:26,800 --> 01:33:28,870
He wasn't gonna do
what those men told him,

1463
01:33:28,960 --> 01:33:30,109
not him.

1464
01:33:30,560 --> 01:33:33,711
You were just gonna get yourself killed.
That's all.

1465
01:33:34,200 --> 01:33:35,349
Somebody had to...

1466
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,078
What were you gonna do, Sheriff?

1467
01:33:37,160 --> 01:33:39,196
I'm glad
I didn't have to make up my mind.

1468
01:33:39,280 --> 01:33:43,512
You weren't going down to that jail,
so somebody had to help you,

1469
01:33:43,920 --> 01:33:46,434
but you don't want anybody to do that,
do you?

1470
01:33:47,400 --> 01:33:50,119
You're right.
You didn't make me help you.

1471
01:33:50,480 --> 01:33:52,152
It was my own idea.

1472
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:53,639
It was my idea to stay here.

1473
01:33:53,720 --> 01:33:56,757
You told me to get on that stage.
I know you did.

1474
01:33:57,080 --> 01:33:58,308
I'm glad you didn't.

1475
01:33:58,400 --> 01:33:59,435
What?

1476
01:33:59,520 --> 01:34:01,112
I'm glad you didn't go.

1477
01:34:03,480 --> 01:34:07,996
What'd you have to say
a thing like that for?

1478
01:34:08,080 --> 01:34:12,517
You know, just when we get one thing
settled you have to go bring up another.

1479
01:34:13,880 --> 01:34:16,314
You just don't make any sense.
That's all.

1480
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:17,913
And neither do I.

1481
01:34:18,240 --> 01:34:20,629
And neither do you, Colorado.
What're you doing in this?

1482
01:34:20,720 --> 01:34:23,678
You don't have the excuse that I have.

1483
01:34:28,520 --> 01:34:31,239
I better go
before I make a fool of myself.

1484
01:34:32,880 --> 01:34:36,111
I don't know why I should go, through,
because we're all fools.

1485
01:34:36,480 --> 01:34:39,313
We ought to get along very well together,
all of us.

1486
01:34:40,760 --> 01:34:42,352
I'm going, anyway.

1487
01:34:42,880 --> 01:34:45,235
We're just a bunch of idiots. That's all.

1488
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:47,675
Just a bunch of idiots.

1489
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,551
How did she get mixed up in this?

1490
01:34:52,160 --> 01:34:53,798
She didn't feel too good.

1491
01:34:53,960 --> 01:34:57,475
- She had a couple of drinks.
- I don't mean this. I mean out there.

1492
01:34:58,080 --> 01:35:02,119
She was going outside to help you.
How, I don't know, and neither did she.

1493
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:05,120
I told her to throw that flower pot
through the window,

1494
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:06,997
and I went out instead.

1495
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,594
And that's your reason for throwing in
with me.

1496
01:35:09,920 --> 01:35:11,911
She's right. It doesn't make any sense.

1497
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:14,150
Wheeler just talked about helping me,

1498
01:35:14,440 --> 01:35:16,237
but you saved my neck.

1499
01:35:16,360 --> 01:35:18,920
- Burdette isn't gonna kiss you for that.
- No.

1500
01:35:19,000 --> 01:35:20,274
So you're in.

1501
01:35:21,200 --> 01:35:23,097
Don't tell me
you didn't think about that.

1502
01:35:23,098 --> 01:35:24,795
Before you did it, I mean.

1503
01:35:25,160 --> 01:35:27,720
If I'm gonna get shot at,
I might as well get paid for it.

1504
01:35:27,800 --> 01:35:29,518
How do I get a badge?

1505
01:35:29,960 --> 01:35:31,678
Come on, I'll get you one.

1506
01:35:32,600 --> 01:35:35,558
I ought to tell you. Dude's quitting.

1507
01:35:36,960 --> 01:35:40,635
I'm sorry for that,
but I figure why is not my business.

1508
01:35:41,320 --> 01:35:44,437
You've got peculiar ways
of choosing what is your business.

1509
01:35:48,040 --> 01:35:50,190
You telling me
they was gonna bring Chance in here

1510
01:35:50,280 --> 01:35:52,032
to make me turn Joe loose?

1511
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,599
Why, they're crazy.

1512
01:35:53,720 --> 01:35:55,039
Goll-darned fools.

1513
01:35:55,120 --> 01:35:57,998
Chance comes in here with three strangers
and tells me to unlock that door.

1514
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:01,072
What do they think I'm gonna do?
You know what I'm gonna do.

1515
01:36:01,960 --> 01:36:03,871
I'm gonna start blasting.

1516
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:06,399
Where'd you get that hat?

1517
01:36:06,480 --> 01:36:08,471
Chance gave it to me, for a souvenir.

1518
01:36:08,560 --> 01:36:09,595
For a what?

1519
01:36:09,680 --> 01:36:10,669
Stumpy, we're coming in.

1520
01:36:10,760 --> 01:36:11,909
Well, come ahead.

1521
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:13,911
See, he ain't too proud to yell.

1522
01:36:16,720 --> 01:36:19,598
Stumpy, where do you keep
the deputy-sheriff badges?

1523
01:36:19,680 --> 01:36:21,591
In the right-hand drawer there.

1524
01:36:21,840 --> 01:36:24,070
You know where that book is,
the one with the oath?

1525
01:36:24,160 --> 01:36:26,196
No!
If you can't take care of your own truck,

1526
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:27,759
don't look for me to do it.

1527
01:36:27,840 --> 01:36:30,559
We'll have to do without it.
Raise your right hand.

1528
01:36:30,640 --> 01:36:33,757
Do you solemnly swear to take on
the duties of a sheriff's deputy...

1529
01:36:33,840 --> 01:36:36,832
Found yourself another knot head
who don't know when he's well off?

1530
01:36:36,920 --> 01:36:39,832
...in the County of Presidio
of the great State of Texas?

1531
01:36:39,920 --> 01:36:40,955
I do.

1532
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:43,669
And that includes taking orders from me.

1533
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,433
All right, Sheriff.

1534
01:36:45,520 --> 01:36:46,714
How about giving me one.

1535
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:48,836
Get over to the hotel
and pick up your stuff.

1536
01:36:48,920 --> 01:36:50,319
Move in here.

1537
01:36:51,040 --> 01:36:52,712
What're you laughing about?

1538
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:54,711
What I got myself in for.

1539
01:36:56,280 --> 01:36:58,032
Cheerful about it anyways, ain't he?

1540
01:36:58,120 --> 01:36:59,633
How good do you think he is?

1541
01:36:59,720 --> 01:37:00,755
He's all right.

1542
01:37:00,840 --> 01:37:02,637
You think he's as good
as Wheeler said he was?

1543
01:37:02,720 --> 01:37:05,996
He threw me my gun, and while it was
still in the air, he got one of 'em.

1544
01:37:06,080 --> 01:37:08,514
- Then he got another one.
- Good enough.

1545
01:37:08,680 --> 01:37:10,557
Is he as good as I used to be?

1546
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,158
It'd be pretty close.

1547
01:37:15,240 --> 01:37:17,629
I'd hate to have to live
on the difference.

1548
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:22,830
Then you got the best of it. Him for me.

1549
01:37:24,840 --> 01:37:26,831
What's he talking about, "him for me"?

1550
01:37:26,920 --> 01:37:29,229
Nobody never tells me nothing
around here.

1551
01:37:29,320 --> 01:37:30,719
He's quitting.

1552
01:37:33,560 --> 01:37:34,993
What's got into you?

1553
01:37:35,160 --> 01:37:37,549
Look at me. Ain't that purty, huh?

1554
01:37:38,040 --> 01:37:39,553
Shaking worse all the time.

1555
01:37:39,640 --> 01:37:42,518
What can a man do with hands like that?
Go ahead. Tell me, what?

1556
01:37:42,600 --> 01:37:44,794
Take a drink!
You said Chance told you to.

1557
01:37:44,795 --> 01:37:46,388
You did, didn't you, Chance?

1558
01:37:46,480 --> 01:37:48,391
He can take the whole bottle.

1559
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:49,913
Go ahead.

1560
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:15,435
Stumpy,

1561
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:18,674
don't close it.

1562
01:38:39,040 --> 01:38:40,473
Didn't spill a drop.

1563
01:38:44,120 --> 01:38:48,033
Shakes are gone
just because of a piece of music.

1564
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:54,274
Till they played that piece,
I forgot how I got into this thing.

1565
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:59,072
Keep on playing it.
I don't think I'll ever forget again.

1566
01:39:00,120 --> 01:39:03,351
Chance, give me another shot at it.

1567
01:39:04,600 --> 01:39:06,511
Stumpy can take the bottle away.

1568
01:39:11,240 --> 01:39:12,434
You heard him.

1569
01:39:15,000 --> 01:39:18,549
"Bring it out. Put it back."
Nobody ever asks me if I need a drink.

1570
01:39:19,200 --> 01:39:21,634
I ain't gonna wait for 'em to ask me
'cause I do.

1571
01:39:21,720 --> 01:39:23,915
You two's enough to drive a man to it.

1572
01:39:27,000 --> 01:39:29,116
I think I'll go watch the road again,

1573
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,275
unless you need me for something else.

1574
01:39:33,800 --> 01:39:35,518
Did you forget this?

1575
01:39:37,040 --> 01:39:38,519
You could clean up a little.

1576
01:39:38,600 --> 01:39:40,875
Yeah, you're a heck of a looking deputy.

1577
01:39:41,720 --> 01:39:43,278
I'm better than I look.

1578
01:39:43,840 --> 01:39:45,432
I'll do that tonight.

1579
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:49,399
If you think of it, send me some food.
I think I could eat something.

1580
01:39:52,040 --> 01:39:53,917
Nothing in his stomach.

1581
01:39:54,160 --> 01:39:55,752
Nothing but guts.

1582
01:39:56,200 --> 01:39:59,078
You can quit worrying about him
and start thinking about me.

1583
01:39:59,160 --> 01:40:01,674
We know about him.
He's gonna be all right, but I ain't.

1584
01:40:01,760 --> 01:40:04,672
That got my goat.
I can't watch a man get down...

1585
01:40:04,760 --> 01:40:06,159
Where are you going?

1586
01:40:06,800 --> 01:40:09,360
To get Dude something to eat,
and you'd better...

1587
01:40:09,440 --> 01:40:11,431
I know. Get back in my hole.

1588
01:40:11,520 --> 01:40:14,717
No, you'd better watch out for Colorado
when he comes back.

1589
01:40:14,800 --> 01:40:17,473
I forgot to tell him
how trigger-happy you are.

1590
01:40:17,760 --> 01:40:21,878
We get a good man. He has to watch you
to keep from getting shot full of holes.

1591
01:40:21,960 --> 01:40:23,518
Close the window!

1592
01:40:24,640 --> 01:40:27,712
Still talking
about that little accident last night.

1593
01:40:27,960 --> 01:40:30,474
Never can satisfy him.

1594
01:42:37,080 --> 01:42:39,071
That's real purty. Go on, play some more.

1595
01:42:39,160 --> 01:42:40,878
Why don't you play
something I can sing with you.

1596
01:42:49,160 --> 01:42:50,718
That's a good one.

1597
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:57,192
That's nice. Ain't it, Chance?

1598
01:43:57,280 --> 01:43:59,953
It's better than being out in the street
and getting shot at.

1599
01:44:00,040 --> 01:44:01,837
I can't argue with you.

1600
01:44:02,080 --> 01:44:03,149
You're right, Stumpy.

1601
01:44:03,240 --> 01:44:04,275
Right about what?

1602
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,634
I should have thought of it before.

1603
01:44:05,720 --> 01:44:07,392
Thought about what?

1604
01:44:07,520 --> 01:44:11,115
Burdette's shown his hand.
He isn't gonna rush this jail.

1605
01:44:11,200 --> 01:44:13,395
Everything he's tried has been outside.

1606
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:15,630
We could sit right here
and wait for the Marshal.

1607
01:44:15,720 --> 01:44:17,438
Only be three or four days.

1608
01:44:18,000 --> 01:44:20,560
How much food you got, Stumpy?
Enough for all of us?

1609
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:22,517
Yeah, if you can eat what I eat.

1610
01:44:22,600 --> 01:44:23,715
Water and firewood?

1611
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:24,869
Filled up this morning.

1612
01:44:24,960 --> 01:44:28,032
We do need some blankets and tobaccy
and matches,

1613
01:44:28,120 --> 01:44:29,235
unless you got plenty.

1614
01:44:29,320 --> 01:44:30,514
He ain't.

1615
01:44:30,720 --> 01:44:32,199
And a few bottles of beer, Dude?

1616
01:44:32,280 --> 01:44:33,315
Thanks, Stumpy.

1617
01:44:33,400 --> 01:44:34,879
There's another thing, now.

1618
01:44:34,960 --> 01:44:38,953
If we're all gonna be in here
three or four days, close together like,

1619
01:44:39,160 --> 01:44:41,415
it might be a good idea
if a certain party,

1620
01:44:41,416 --> 01:44:42,470
not to mention no names,

1621
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:46,997
was to do what he said he'd do.
Now, a horse barn's a good place,

1622
01:44:47,080 --> 01:44:48,559
but it ain't no place
for a fellow to roll around in.

1623
01:44:48,640 --> 01:44:49,755
All right, Stumpy.

1624
01:44:49,840 --> 01:44:52,149
Now, me, I like roses,
but this fellow ain't no rose,

1625
01:44:52,240 --> 01:44:53,559
this fellow I'm talking about.

1626
01:44:53,640 --> 01:44:55,995
I'm gonna take a bath. I said I would.

1627
01:44:56,080 --> 01:44:58,674
Dude, I never had no idea you wouldn't.

1628
01:44:58,960 --> 01:45:00,871
I was just a-wondering when.

1629
01:45:00,960 --> 01:45:03,190
He'll keep talking
till we get out of here.

1630
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,874
Come on, I'll take a bath
while you gather up the stuff.

1631
01:45:05,960 --> 01:45:09,509
Yell when you get back 'cause
you look different when you're clean.

1632
01:45:12,800 --> 01:45:14,153
How you do that?

1633
01:45:14,240 --> 01:45:16,879
It's easy, Carlos.
You just weren't watching.

1634
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,233
Carlos, open up.

1635
01:45:19,320 --> 01:45:20,833
Coming.

1636
01:45:23,920 --> 01:45:25,797
I think it is best to lock the door.

1637
01:45:25,880 --> 01:45:26,869
Yeah.

1638
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:30,032
Carlos, I'm sleeping over at the jail
tonight. All of us are.

1639
01:45:30,120 --> 01:45:33,874
We'll need some blankets,
plenty of tobacco and matches.

1640
01:45:33,960 --> 01:45:34,949
And some beer, too.

1641
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:36,029
Feeling better?

1642
01:45:36,120 --> 01:45:37,109
Much better.

1643
01:45:37,200 --> 01:45:38,235
That's all you need?

1644
01:45:38,320 --> 01:45:39,309
That's all.

1645
01:45:39,400 --> 01:45:41,470
When you get the stuff together,
let us know.

1646
01:45:41,560 --> 01:45:43,391
- I'll be upstairs.
- Coming up.

1647
01:45:47,640 --> 01:45:49,471
Now, don't make any noise.

1648
01:45:52,160 --> 01:45:53,479
Open your mouth.

1649
01:46:18,120 --> 01:46:19,439
Hi, Feathers.

1650
01:46:19,520 --> 01:46:21,750
Have you got any soap
that smells like roses?

1651
01:46:21,840 --> 01:46:24,400
I have some soap,
but it doesn't smell like a rose.

1652
01:46:24,480 --> 01:46:27,074
Won't do. Won't do. Stumpy likes roses.

1653
01:46:27,840 --> 01:46:28,989
Who's Stumpy?

1654
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:30,752
The fella that likes roses.

1655
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:32,752
No, he watches the jail.

1656
01:46:32,840 --> 01:46:34,910
- Hurry it up.
- Right away.

1657
01:46:35,000 --> 01:46:37,798
Yeah, what's all this
about moving down to the jail?

1658
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,432
Something I should've done
two or three days ago.

1659
01:46:41,520 --> 01:46:43,158
Are you sorry you didn't?

1660
01:46:44,560 --> 01:46:45,754
Are you?

1661
01:46:46,400 --> 01:46:48,436
I know an easy way of telling you.

1662
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:52,836
Can't you talk plainer than that?

1663
01:46:53,480 --> 01:46:54,913
Chance, give me a towel, will you?

1664
01:46:55,000 --> 01:46:56,069
I'm busy.

1665
01:46:56,160 --> 01:46:57,229
What'd you say?

1666
01:46:57,320 --> 01:46:58,912
Somebody's telling me something.

1667
01:46:59,000 --> 01:47:00,274
I can't...

1668
01:47:00,360 --> 01:47:01,998
Give me a towel, will you?

1669
01:47:03,880 --> 01:47:05,393
He's a big help.

1670
01:47:05,640 --> 01:47:07,471
I'll finish telling you later.

1671
01:47:15,880 --> 01:47:17,199
The Dude went in to take a bath.

1672
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:19,919
I couldn't see very good,
but I don't think he has his guns.

1673
01:47:20,000 --> 01:47:21,831
The Sheriff's upstairs
talking to the girl.

1674
01:47:21,920 --> 01:47:22,955
He has his guns.

1675
01:47:23,320 --> 01:47:25,276
I don't wanna be the one
to go up and get him.

1676
01:47:25,360 --> 01:47:26,634
Burdette wants him alive.

1677
01:47:26,720 --> 01:47:28,119
Then don't talk so loud.

1678
01:47:28,200 --> 01:47:31,431
He'll come charging down here with
that rifle, and we'll have to kill him.

1679
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:32,555
That might just work.

1680
01:47:32,640 --> 01:47:33,868
What?

1681
01:47:34,160 --> 01:47:35,752
The stairs are pretty dark.

1682
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:36,989
We stretch a rope across 'em.

1683
01:47:37,080 --> 01:47:38,399
Let him hear something.

1684
01:47:38,480 --> 01:47:39,913
Give me that piece of rope.

1685
01:47:40,000 --> 01:47:41,592
Come on, give me a hand.

1686
01:47:59,040 --> 01:48:00,393
Hurry it up, will you?

1687
01:48:00,480 --> 01:48:01,708
Be right out.

1688
01:48:02,640 --> 01:48:06,872
If you're leaving,
I might as well get some sleep.

1689
01:48:06,960 --> 01:48:09,997
I don't suppose I could come by the jail
once in a while

1690
01:48:10,080 --> 01:48:11,354
and see if you needed anything.

1691
01:48:11,440 --> 01:48:13,715
I don't want you any place around there.

1692
01:48:14,040 --> 01:48:15,519
I was afraid of that.

1693
01:48:16,320 --> 01:48:19,039
That means I won't see you
for three or four days.

1694
01:48:19,760 --> 01:48:21,557
That's a long time, you know.

1695
01:48:22,720 --> 01:48:24,278
You'll live through it.

1696
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:27,278
Yeah, you do the same.

1697
01:48:38,400 --> 01:48:41,517
All right, you both better get out there.
You, too, Pedro.

1698
01:48:41,840 --> 01:48:43,637
Leave the door open a little.

1699
01:48:43,960 --> 01:48:45,791
Get the gag out of her mouth.

1700
01:48:46,960 --> 01:48:49,793
Now, lady, we want you
to call the Sheriff down here.

1701
01:48:50,360 --> 01:48:52,271
No! No!

1702
01:48:52,520 --> 01:48:53,919
Maybe this'll help.

1703
01:48:54,400 --> 01:48:56,709
Please don't. Don't!

1704
01:49:04,440 --> 01:49:06,556
He's out cold. Get upstairs, quick!

1705
01:49:09,600 --> 01:49:10,828
Hold it, Dude.

1706
01:49:11,160 --> 01:49:12,195
Watch him.

1707
01:49:15,320 --> 01:49:16,878
Just keep coming, lady.

1708
01:49:17,880 --> 01:49:19,791
All right, everybody downstairs.

1709
01:49:28,320 --> 01:49:30,356
All right, get on your feet.

1710
01:49:37,160 --> 01:49:38,832
Come on, get up!

1711
01:49:45,600 --> 01:49:46,794
Can you walk?

1712
01:49:48,960 --> 01:49:50,279
Where are we going?

1713
01:49:50,360 --> 01:49:51,634
That's up to you.

1714
01:49:51,760 --> 01:49:53,591
We go over to the jail,
and you let Joe go,

1715
01:49:53,680 --> 01:49:55,955
or we tuck you two away
and make a trade with Stumpy.

1716
01:49:56,040 --> 01:49:57,189
Take your choice.

1717
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:59,350
You won't make any deal with Stumpy.

1718
01:49:59,960 --> 01:50:01,518
You'll just get Joe killed.

1719
01:50:01,600 --> 01:50:02,999
Not if he knows we got you two.

1720
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:04,991
They got us. We're licked.

1721
01:50:05,080 --> 01:50:06,537
Go on, take 'em over to the jail,

1722
01:50:06,538 --> 01:50:08,595
and tell Stumpy to open up
and let Joe go.

1723
01:50:08,680 --> 01:50:11,319
- Are you out of your mind?
- I'm telling you to do it now.

1724
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:12,549
Stumpy couldn't hold out.

1725
01:50:12,640 --> 01:50:14,676
He hasn't got any water or food,
and he's all alone.

1726
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,354
Nobody to get him any water. He's alone.
Now, go on. Do it.

1727
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,351
- Do you know what you're saying?
- I do.

1728
01:50:19,440 --> 01:50:22,034
I'm thinking good, too.
Now, do what I tell you.

1729
01:50:23,440 --> 01:50:25,829
And after they get Joe, what happens?

1730
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:27,558
All we want is Joe.

1731
01:50:30,240 --> 01:50:31,958
You still think it's a good idea?

1732
01:50:32,040 --> 01:50:33,678
I still think it's good.

1733
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,478
We'll go over to the jail.

1734
01:50:37,560 --> 01:50:39,039
Take the shells out of his gun.

1735
01:50:39,120 --> 01:50:40,599
I unloaded his pistol.

1736
01:50:40,680 --> 01:50:42,955
Steve, you and Harry come along with me.

1737
01:50:43,040 --> 01:50:46,828
Now, look, Sheriff,
we're going out of here natural like.

1738
01:50:46,920 --> 01:50:48,114
You carry your gun,

1739
01:50:48,200 --> 01:50:51,317
and don't do anything to make
anybody think something's wrong.

1740
01:50:51,400 --> 01:50:54,995
If you have to explain to Stumpy,
tell him we put up bail for Joe.

1741
01:50:55,520 --> 01:50:58,114
Burdette's got it figured out
pretty good.

1742
01:50:58,200 --> 01:51:01,715
If it was up to me,
you'd have never got up off the floor.

1743
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,714
Some of those you killed
were friends of mine.

1744
01:51:05,000 --> 01:51:06,353
Give him his rifle.

1745
01:51:09,320 --> 01:51:10,355
You first.

1746
01:51:46,280 --> 01:51:47,474
Hold it.

1747
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:51,909
Yell to Stumpy you're coming in.
We've been watching you.

1748
01:51:53,680 --> 01:51:55,432
Stumpy, this is Chance.

1749
01:51:55,520 --> 01:51:57,078
It took you long enough.

1750
01:51:57,160 --> 01:51:59,151
Steve, cover from out here.

1751
01:52:06,880 --> 01:52:09,952
All right, open up.
We're gonna let Joe go.

1752
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:11,308
How come?

1753
01:52:12,040 --> 01:52:14,156
His friends here put up bail.

1754
01:52:14,720 --> 01:52:17,359
Give me the keys, then.
They're on your desk there.

1755
01:52:18,560 --> 01:52:19,754
I forgot.

1756
01:52:29,200 --> 01:52:30,235
Easy.

1757
01:52:30,320 --> 01:52:31,719
This fella will talk all right.

1758
01:52:31,800 --> 01:52:33,438
Watch him. I'm going after Dude.

1759
01:52:33,520 --> 01:52:35,795
You go along with him. I'll watch him.

1760
01:52:38,720 --> 01:52:40,153
Now, watch yourself.

1761
01:52:40,240 --> 01:52:42,231
There's two of 'em holding Dude.

1762
01:52:44,640 --> 01:52:45,755
The window.

1763
01:52:57,200 --> 01:52:58,872
All right, Colorado.

1764
01:53:06,800 --> 01:53:08,597
In here, <i>Seor</i> Chance.

1765
01:53:09,360 --> 01:53:10,395
They're gone.

1766
01:53:10,480 --> 01:53:12,630
They took Dude a moment ago
when they heard the shooting.

1767
01:53:12,720 --> 01:53:15,712
They went out the back door.
They had horses. I heard them.

1768
01:53:18,720 --> 01:53:20,312
They're gone all right.

1769
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:23,158
We gonna go after 'em?

1770
01:53:24,520 --> 01:53:29,753
I told Nathan Burdette what'd happen
if he came after his brother.

1771
01:53:30,720 --> 01:53:32,358
You ought to remember that.

1772
01:53:32,440 --> 01:53:34,112
You thought it was funny.

1773
01:53:34,200 --> 01:53:36,794
What do you think
he'd do if we went after Dude?

1774
01:53:37,200 --> 01:53:38,428
I didn't think.

1775
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:40,870
Looks like the shoe's
on the other foot now.

1776
01:53:40,960 --> 01:53:43,554
The men who took Dude,
they were very angry.

1777
01:53:43,880 --> 01:53:45,871
They say Dude set a trap for them.

1778
01:53:45,960 --> 01:53:48,030
He sent 'em over there, all right.

1779
01:53:48,320 --> 01:53:51,551
He knew what he was doing,
knew what Stumpy'd do, too.

1780
01:53:52,600 --> 01:53:54,318
That's why they're not happy about it.

1781
01:53:54,400 --> 01:53:55,799
What're you gonna do?

1782
01:53:55,880 --> 01:53:57,791
It's what Burdette'll do.

1783
01:53:58,680 --> 01:54:00,875
Carlos. Get a hold of Burdette.

1784
01:54:01,640 --> 01:54:04,359
I don't care how.
Tell him I want to talk to him.

1785
01:54:04,440 --> 01:54:07,876
Tell him to set the time and the place,
but I want to talk to him.

1786
01:54:08,040 --> 01:54:09,075
We'll be at the jail.

1787
01:54:15,120 --> 01:54:17,873
Aren't you sorry now
you didn't get on the stage?

1788
01:54:23,160 --> 01:54:24,513
Come on, Colorado.

1789
01:54:24,840 --> 01:54:26,831
Let's wake up the Chinaman again.

1790
01:54:55,480 --> 01:54:57,630
<i>Seor</i> Chance, it's me, Carlos.

1791
01:55:02,080 --> 01:55:03,911
What's the matter? What'd he say?

1792
01:55:04,000 --> 01:55:05,797
He say he don't want to talk to you.

1793
01:55:05,880 --> 01:55:08,678
He say if you want Dude back,
he'll make a trade.

1794
01:55:08,760 --> 01:55:09,749
A trade?

1795
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:10,989
Dude for Joe.

1796
01:55:11,080 --> 01:55:13,150
He'll be in his place over by the creek,

1797
01:55:13,240 --> 01:55:14,798
- the... What's it called?
- Warehouse?

1798
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:17,030
He'll be there half an hour after sunup.

1799
01:55:17,120 --> 01:55:20,590
He'll have Dude.
If you bring Joe, he'll be waiting.

1800
01:55:20,680 --> 01:55:22,272
He said to let him know.

1801
01:55:27,400 --> 01:55:28,719
Tell him we'll be there.

1802
01:55:28,800 --> 01:55:31,598
You're crazy! You can't do that.

1803
01:55:31,680 --> 01:55:33,511
You couldn't do that
even if Dude was your own brother.

1804
01:55:33,600 --> 01:55:34,635
What can I do?

1805
01:55:34,720 --> 01:55:36,312
Just what we figured on doing
in the first place.

1806
01:55:36,400 --> 01:55:38,197
Hole up here till the Marshal gets here.

1807
01:55:38,280 --> 01:55:40,748
When the Marshal takes Joe,
what'll happen to Dude?

1808
01:55:40,840 --> 01:55:43,673
Dude knew what he was in for
when he sent you over here.

1809
01:55:43,760 --> 01:55:46,228
I'd like to add my two-cents worth,
Sheriff.

1810
01:55:46,600 --> 01:55:47,669
Go ahead.

1811
01:55:47,760 --> 01:55:49,990
From what I hear,
you and Dude are the only witnesses.

1812
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,389
Let's say we're the only ones
that'll talk.

1813
01:55:52,480 --> 01:55:55,313
After Nathan gets Joe back,
he's still got to live here,

1814
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:57,391
which means you two can't,

1815
01:55:57,480 --> 01:55:59,436
and if you don't have Joe,
what'll stop him?

1816
01:55:59,520 --> 01:56:00,873
The brakes'll be off then.

1817
01:56:00,960 --> 01:56:02,951
That ought to be as plain
as the nose on your face.

1818
01:56:03,040 --> 01:56:04,598
You're right, Colorado,

1819
01:56:05,400 --> 01:56:07,316
but you and Stumpy
didn't see the killing.

1820
01:56:07,791 --> 01:56:09,632
I don't think he'll bother you two.

1821
01:56:09,720 --> 01:56:11,233
- I'm not worried about that.
- Me, neither.

1822
01:56:11,320 --> 01:56:13,197
You'll just wait for the Marshal to come.

1823
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:15,510
It's a fact
he's still gonna want you and Dude.

1824
01:56:15,600 --> 01:56:16,589
I'd say so.

1825
01:56:16,680 --> 01:56:18,830
You can't get out of town
on account of he's got it bottled up.

1826
01:56:18,920 --> 01:56:20,512
When you make the trade and get Dude,

1827
01:56:20,600 --> 01:56:22,158
then Burdette's gonna get
the both of you.

1828
01:56:22,240 --> 01:56:23,355
After a little argument.

1829
01:56:23,440 --> 01:56:25,556
All right, but why at all?
Why the both of you?

1830
01:56:25,640 --> 01:56:27,437
Dude ought to have a chance.

1831
01:56:27,520 --> 01:56:30,159
He won't get one the other way. Will he?

1832
01:56:30,480 --> 01:56:31,629
Will he?

1833
01:56:32,440 --> 01:56:34,271
You're gonna have me crying.

1834
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:36,868
Fella's gotta be a drunk
to get anywhere around here,

1835
01:56:36,960 --> 01:56:38,871
and I might as well start right now.

1836
01:56:41,080 --> 01:56:42,433
Go ahead, Carlos.

1837
01:56:57,960 --> 01:57:01,475
Burdette's here.

1838
01:57:04,640 --> 01:57:05,868
About time to go.

1839
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:08,709
How about me going ahead,
see if they're gonna play any tricks?

1840
01:57:08,800 --> 01:57:10,199
Look out here.

1841
01:57:11,040 --> 01:57:13,076
We're drawing quite a crowd.

1842
01:57:13,320 --> 01:57:16,915
There won't be any tricks,
at least not till we make the trade.

1843
01:57:17,080 --> 01:57:19,036
Besides, you're not going.

1844
01:57:19,280 --> 01:57:22,317
When you decided to make the trade
for Dude, I went along with you.

1845
01:57:22,400 --> 01:57:23,913
I'm going along now.

1846
01:57:24,080 --> 01:57:25,069
Why?

1847
01:57:26,040 --> 01:57:27,951
Just say I'd like a closer look.

1848
01:57:31,280 --> 01:57:34,113
Up to now, I thought you were smart.
Stumpy, you're not going.

1849
01:57:34,200 --> 01:57:37,033
Why ain't I going?
Give me one good reason. Why?

1850
01:57:37,680 --> 01:57:39,238
I'll give you one.

1851
01:57:39,320 --> 01:57:42,790
You've done a good job in here because
you haven't had to move around much,

1852
01:57:42,880 --> 01:57:46,475
but out there, if anything happens,
you'll have to move and move fast.

1853
01:57:46,760 --> 01:57:48,955
I'd feel better if you weren't there.

1854
01:57:49,760 --> 01:57:52,797
It's plain enough.
Old cripples ain't wanted.

1855
01:57:53,680 --> 01:57:56,035
You give me a reason.

1856
01:58:00,240 --> 01:58:05,234
Do you want that I should bring Joe out,
or do you want to do that yourself?

1857
01:58:05,640 --> 01:58:07,073
Bring him out.

1858
01:58:14,320 --> 01:58:17,039
I think I'll take along a rifle,
some extra shells.

1859
01:58:17,400 --> 01:58:18,628
Yeah.

1860
01:58:26,000 --> 01:58:27,911
I told you I'd get out of here.

1861
01:58:28,240 --> 01:58:31,118
Open your mouth again,
and we'll carry you out.

1862
01:58:32,400 --> 01:58:33,913
See you, Stumpy.

1863
01:58:39,440 --> 01:58:40,429
See you.

1864
01:59:30,600 --> 01:59:32,158
That's far enough, Joe.

1865
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:38,599
Through the barn.

1866
01:59:50,200 --> 01:59:54,398
Just sit down over there
on those grain sacks.

1867
02:00:16,760 --> 02:00:18,318
You want a closer look?

1868
02:00:19,240 --> 02:00:20,958
This is close enough.

1869
02:00:21,440 --> 02:00:22,759
Take that window.

1870
02:00:23,160 --> 02:00:24,434
Watch Joe.

1871
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:42,954
Burdette!

1872
02:00:46,160 --> 02:00:47,434
Burdette!

1873
02:00:47,800 --> 02:00:49,438
Nathan Burdette!

1874
02:00:54,880 --> 02:00:55,995
We're ready.

1875
02:00:56,160 --> 02:00:57,479
Joe's here.

1876
02:00:57,880 --> 02:00:59,438
We're ready, too.

1877
02:01:00,520 --> 02:01:01,589
Start Dude.

1878
02:01:02,480 --> 02:01:04,232
I'll start Joe.

1879
02:01:04,320 --> 02:01:05,514
Go ahead.

1880
02:01:09,560 --> 02:01:11,039
All right, Joe.

1881
02:01:14,480 --> 02:01:17,040
You can start walking very slow,

1882
02:01:18,360 --> 02:01:20,396
and stop if I say stop,

1883
02:01:21,680 --> 02:01:23,113
or I'll stop you.

1884
02:01:24,000 --> 02:01:25,228
Bring him out.

1885
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:31,274
Go ahead.

1886
02:01:32,000 --> 02:01:33,035
Slow.

1887
02:02:13,160 --> 02:02:14,149
Look out!

1888
02:02:30,720 --> 02:02:32,631
Do you want me to go help Dude?

1889
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:34,472
He'll take Joe all right.

1890
02:02:36,320 --> 02:02:38,390
He's got a strange way of doing it.

1891
02:02:39,400 --> 02:02:40,628
He'll take him.

1892
02:02:45,840 --> 02:02:47,398
You're right. He did.

1893
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:51,392
Hey, Chance, I got Joe.

1894
02:02:52,000 --> 02:02:53,877
He can't walk, but I can drag him.

1895
02:02:53,960 --> 02:02:55,598
Stay right where you are.

1896
02:02:55,840 --> 02:02:57,193
We'll throw you a gun.

1897
02:02:57,280 --> 02:02:58,838
I'll do it. I'm closer.

1898
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:13,389
Wait till we start shooting, Dude,
then make a grab for it.

1899
02:03:14,160 --> 02:03:16,276
Let's make a little noise, Colorado.

1900
02:03:48,240 --> 02:03:49,878
That ought to start something.

1901
02:03:50,720 --> 02:03:51,835
It will.

1902
02:03:54,480 --> 02:03:55,674
On your left!

1903
02:03:59,440 --> 02:04:01,112
Two of them made it to that shack.

1904
02:04:01,200 --> 02:04:03,668
If they get across that creek,
we'll be in bad shape.

1905
02:04:03,760 --> 02:04:04,988
They'll get behind us.

1906
02:04:05,080 --> 02:04:06,832
I don't know
how we're gonna stop them from here.

1907
02:04:12,640 --> 02:04:14,073
Is that who I think it is?

1908
02:04:14,160 --> 02:04:15,195
Old Stumpy,

1909
02:04:15,760 --> 02:04:17,398
the fella I left behind.

1910
02:04:18,960 --> 02:04:20,951
<i>Seor</i> Chance, don't shoot.
It's me.

1911
02:04:21,040 --> 02:04:22,951
Carlos, what are you doing here?

1912
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,079
I bring you some more shells.
You might need them, <i>seor</i>.

1913
02:04:26,160 --> 02:04:27,434
Who'll turn up next?

1914
02:04:27,520 --> 02:04:29,750
Maybe the girl with another flower pot.

1915
02:04:31,360 --> 02:04:35,069
Chance, Stumpy's sitting in a bad place.
That wagon's got dynamite in it.

1916
02:04:36,040 --> 02:04:37,519
I go tell him, <i>seor</i>.

1917
02:04:37,600 --> 02:04:39,750
You stay here. I'll go get him.

1918
02:04:39,840 --> 02:04:41,239
Give me those shells.

1919
02:05:06,560 --> 02:05:08,676
Stumpy, get out of there.

1920
02:05:09,160 --> 02:05:12,038
No. Come on, I got a front seat.
It's a good one.

1921
02:05:12,120 --> 02:05:13,712
You got a good seat, all right.

1922
02:05:13,800 --> 02:05:15,711
That's wagon's full of dynamite.

1923
02:05:16,000 --> 02:05:17,638
Jumping Jehoshaphat.

1924
02:05:18,040 --> 02:05:20,031
Why don't nobody never tell me nothing?

1925
02:05:20,120 --> 02:05:23,510
Get away from that wagon,
or you won't be around to hear anything.

1926
02:05:40,600 --> 02:05:42,636
Stumpy, hurry up! What are you doing?

1927
02:05:42,720 --> 02:05:45,188
What do you think I'm doing?
Taking a <i>siesta?</i>

1928
02:05:46,600 --> 02:05:48,272
I brung us some dynamite.

1929
02:05:48,840 --> 02:05:50,239
That's a good idea.

1930
02:05:50,400 --> 02:05:52,675
Let's get farther away from that wagon.

1931
02:05:56,440 --> 02:05:58,635
Can you shoot as good
as you say you can?

1932
02:05:58,720 --> 02:06:01,075
- Can you throw?
- Near as far as you can shoot.

1933
02:06:01,160 --> 02:06:03,230
We'll find out. Get that box open.

1934
02:06:07,240 --> 02:06:08,309
Dude!

1935
02:06:09,280 --> 02:06:10,633
Over here.

1936
02:06:11,480 --> 02:06:12,515
Get ready.

1937
02:06:12,680 --> 02:06:13,999
Let her go!

1938
02:06:20,400 --> 02:06:21,833
That was a good one.

1939
02:06:22,880 --> 02:06:24,677
Stop cackling.

1940
02:06:24,800 --> 02:06:26,950
Get one a little farther out there.

1941
02:06:27,040 --> 02:06:28,678
There you go again!

1942
02:06:29,240 --> 02:06:31,834
What would you do
if I wasn't throwing 'em for you?

1943
02:06:31,920 --> 02:06:33,353
I'd throw 'em myself.

1944
02:06:33,440 --> 02:06:35,635
Yeah, I guess you would at that.
You ready?

1945
02:06:35,720 --> 02:06:36,994
Let her go.

1946
02:06:42,200 --> 02:06:44,760
Dude, how do you like them apples?

1947
02:06:44,840 --> 02:06:46,068
That's all right.

1948
02:06:46,160 --> 02:06:47,559
Throw one for me.

1949
02:06:47,800 --> 02:06:49,791
Go ahead, but throw it harder this time.

1950
02:06:49,880 --> 02:06:52,110
There you go again.
You never can satisfy you.

1951
02:06:52,200 --> 02:06:53,315
Throw it!

1952
02:06:53,400 --> 02:06:54,833
Here you are, Dude.

1953
02:07:00,760 --> 02:07:02,159
Took you two.

1954
02:07:02,400 --> 02:07:04,038
I didn't allow for the wind.

1955
02:07:04,120 --> 02:07:06,315
Can't you throw 'em any farther
than you have been?

1956
02:07:06,400 --> 02:07:08,709
Course I can
if you wanna blow the whole place down.

1957
02:07:08,800 --> 02:07:11,519
That's the general idea. Throw it!

1958
02:07:20,080 --> 02:07:21,991
Don't shoot. We've had enough.

1959
02:07:22,200 --> 02:07:24,634
That got 'em.
That took the fight out of 'em.

1960
02:07:24,720 --> 02:07:25,709
Look at 'em quit.

1961
02:07:41,520 --> 02:07:43,158
Sure is quiet out there.

1962
02:07:43,400 --> 02:07:44,594
Did you find anything?

1963
02:07:44,680 --> 02:07:46,352
There isn't a Burdette man left in town

1964
02:07:46,440 --> 02:07:47,839
outside those who got locked up.

1965
02:07:48,560 --> 02:07:51,154
The rest of 'em all cleared out.
We won't have any trouble.

1966
02:07:51,240 --> 02:07:52,559
You're welcome.

1967
02:07:52,640 --> 02:07:53,675
Thank you.

1968
02:07:54,840 --> 02:07:56,478
What do you wanna do about those fellas?

1969
02:07:56,560 --> 02:07:59,028
Want to take 'em to Presidio now,
or wait for the Marshal?

1970
02:07:59,120 --> 02:08:00,189
We'll wait for the Marshal.

1971
02:08:00,280 --> 02:08:01,713
Wait for the Marshal?

1972
02:08:01,800 --> 02:08:05,554
I'm glad you agree, since you have
to cook for 'em and watch 'em.

1973
02:08:05,640 --> 02:08:08,438
That ain't the way I said it.
I said, "Wait for the Marshal?"

1974
02:08:08,520 --> 02:08:09,794
And that's a question.

1975
02:08:09,880 --> 02:08:12,269
I'm fed up feeding 'em,
and I ain't gonna watch 'em, neither.

1976
02:08:12,360 --> 02:08:15,989
I've been sitting back there so long
in the dark that I feel like a gopher

1977
02:08:16,080 --> 02:08:17,957
or a burrowing owl or something.

1978
02:08:18,040 --> 02:08:20,508
When I went outside today,
couldn't hardly see in the daylight.

1979
02:08:20,600 --> 02:08:22,511
I'll watch it for you
if you wanna go out.

1980
02:08:22,600 --> 02:08:24,238
- Would you?
- Sure.

1981
02:08:24,320 --> 02:08:26,276
I guess it's dark enough,
I can go outside now,

1982
02:08:26,360 --> 02:08:27,679
it wouldn't hurt my eyes none.

1983
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:28,909
I don't think it would.

1984
02:08:29,000 --> 02:08:30,877
Maybe get myself slicked up a smidge

1985
02:08:30,960 --> 02:08:32,916
and have a drink.
It wouldn't hurt me, either.

1986
02:08:33,000 --> 02:08:34,592
I don't think it would.

1987
02:08:35,640 --> 02:08:36,834
Should I go?

1988
02:08:36,960 --> 02:08:38,393
Go ahead.

1989
02:08:38,480 --> 02:08:39,595
Go ahead.

1990
02:08:39,680 --> 02:08:41,318
- You ain't gonna give me a argument?
- No.

1991
02:08:41,400 --> 02:08:43,311
Don't care whether I go or not.

1992
02:08:55,480 --> 02:08:57,198
- Chance.
- Yeah?

1993
02:08:57,560 --> 02:08:59,312
Have you seen that girl yet?

1994
02:09:00,160 --> 02:09:02,355
I said, have you seen that girl yet?

1995
02:09:03,200 --> 02:09:04,872
No, I...

1996
02:09:05,080 --> 02:09:06,274
The job.

1997
02:09:07,200 --> 02:09:08,519
Didn't have time.

1998
02:09:09,720 --> 02:09:12,757
The Fort Worth stage is in.
They run at night.

1999
02:09:13,080 --> 02:09:14,399
Should be leaving soon.

2000
02:09:14,480 --> 02:09:15,708
You mean she's going on it?

2001
02:09:15,800 --> 02:09:18,360
I don't know.
I don't think you do, either,

2002
02:09:18,720 --> 02:09:20,631
but if it was me, I'd find out.

2003
02:09:20,720 --> 02:09:23,075
I wouldn't walk around
wondering about it.

2004
02:09:23,640 --> 02:09:26,279
She might be leaving, and she might not.

2005
02:09:26,520 --> 02:09:28,556
She might need a little help
making up her mind.

2006
02:09:28,640 --> 02:09:30,153
But you're the expert.

2007
02:09:30,240 --> 02:09:32,754
Me, I don't know anything about women.

2008
02:09:33,440 --> 02:09:36,398
Next thing, you'll be telling me
you don't remember one.

2009
02:09:37,320 --> 02:09:41,757
A man forgets.

2010
02:09:43,440 --> 02:09:47,638
Sometimes it isn't easy.

2011
02:09:49,880 --> 02:09:52,758
Something happens, he just forgets.

2012
02:09:54,320 --> 02:09:57,437
In case you're interested, I have.

2013
02:09:58,280 --> 02:09:59,952
I don't even want a drink.

2014
02:10:01,080 --> 02:10:02,354
It's about time.

2015
02:10:02,920 --> 02:10:05,480
I was getting awful tired
of taking care of you.

2016
02:10:05,560 --> 02:10:08,438
If you want to jump in,
I'll take care of you.

2017
02:10:09,160 --> 02:10:11,799
What is this now,
you're gonna take care of him?

2018
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:13,871
- Tell me about it.
- Sheriff's got himself a girl.

2019
02:10:13,960 --> 02:10:14,995
Shut up.

2020
02:10:15,080 --> 02:10:16,832
We ain't gonna go through that again,
are we?

2021
02:10:16,920 --> 02:10:19,070
You gonna do the same thing Dude done?

2022
02:10:19,160 --> 02:10:20,195
Keep still.

2023
02:10:20,280 --> 02:10:21,918
Why don't somebody tell me these things?

2024
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,433
Where you going?

2025
02:10:23,520 --> 02:10:24,919
Let him go, Stumpy.

2026
02:10:27,080 --> 02:10:29,196
No fooling,
has the Sheriff got himself a girl?

2027
02:10:29,280 --> 02:10:31,555
I think so, but he doesn't know it yet.

2028
02:10:31,840 --> 02:10:33,193
She got him on the run?

2029
02:10:33,280 --> 02:10:34,429
She sure has.

2030
02:10:35,320 --> 02:10:36,719
I can just see him,

2031
02:10:36,800 --> 02:10:38,756
laying down the law to her.

2032
02:10:38,840 --> 02:10:41,877
"I told you to get back in there!"

2033
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,434
And then getting told off himself.

2034
02:10:50,280 --> 02:10:52,794
<i>Seor</i> Chance,
everything is all right?

2035
02:10:52,880 --> 02:10:54,108
I am so happy.

2036
02:10:54,200 --> 02:10:55,315
Thank you, Consuela.

2037
02:10:55,400 --> 02:10:56,879
You look for the girl?

2038
02:10:56,960 --> 02:10:58,188
She's in there.

2039
02:10:59,000 --> 02:11:01,560
No got time, hah!

2040
02:11:07,760 --> 02:11:09,398
Hi, John T.

2041
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:12,638
Just a second while I get my shoe tied.

2042
02:11:14,680 --> 02:11:15,795
There.

2043
02:11:18,040 --> 02:11:21,032
It's all over, isn't it, John T?

2044
02:11:21,120 --> 02:11:22,917
Where'd you get those things?

2045
02:11:23,440 --> 02:11:25,556
I wore them the last place I worked.

2046
02:11:27,000 --> 02:11:29,514
Why are you wearing them now?

2047
02:11:29,640 --> 02:11:31,392
Tonight's a big night.

2048
02:11:31,480 --> 02:11:33,835
Consuela thought
a little entertainment might help.

2049
02:11:33,920 --> 02:11:35,194
I'm gonna do a song.

2050
02:11:35,280 --> 02:11:37,510
You need a rig like that to sing?

2051
02:11:37,880 --> 02:11:39,313
You haven't heard me sing.

2052
02:11:39,400 --> 02:11:43,154
My legs aren't so bad.
Consuela thought these tights might help,

2053
02:11:44,280 --> 02:11:45,633
but you don't like them.

2054
02:11:45,720 --> 02:11:48,917
- I didn't say that I didn't like them.
- You don't want me to wear them.

2055
02:11:49,000 --> 02:11:50,353
I didn't say that, either.

2056
02:11:50,440 --> 02:11:52,237
Is it because they show so much of me?

2057
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,117
They certainly do that.

2058
02:11:56,080 --> 02:11:59,117
You're a stubborn man, John T.

2059
02:12:00,760 --> 02:12:02,990
Sometimes I know what you're thinking,

2060
02:12:03,760 --> 02:12:05,398
and other times,

2061
02:12:06,320 --> 02:12:09,357
you just can't make up your mind
about me, can you?

2062
02:12:09,560 --> 02:12:10,993
You like what you see.

2063
02:12:11,080 --> 02:12:13,878
You like kissing me.
You like what you touch,

2064
02:12:14,520 --> 02:12:17,751
but you decided in the beginning
what kind of a girl I was,

2065
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,552
and I haven't helped much.

2066
02:12:21,720 --> 02:12:23,995
I wore these before I met you.

2067
02:12:24,080 --> 02:12:25,718
I wanted you to know it,

2068
02:12:26,200 --> 02:12:28,714
to know what kind of a girl
you were getting.

2069
02:12:29,400 --> 02:12:31,789
I wanted you to get
that funny look on your face,

2070
02:12:31,880 --> 02:12:33,791
and tell me not to wear them,

2071
02:12:34,440 --> 02:12:35,839
but it didn't work.

2072
02:12:36,520 --> 02:12:38,112
You didn't even get mad.

2073
02:12:41,560 --> 02:12:44,393
I told you once
you wouldn't have to say anything,

2074
02:12:45,040 --> 02:12:48,510
that I'd know, but I don't know,

2075
02:12:49,760 --> 02:12:51,591
so you're gonna have to talk.

2076
02:12:52,760 --> 02:12:57,675
I'm hard to get, John T.
You're gonna have to say you want me.

2077
02:12:57,760 --> 02:12:58,954
Where are you going?

2078
02:12:59,040 --> 02:13:00,268
Downstairs.

2079
02:13:00,360 --> 02:13:01,634
You'd better not.

2080
02:13:02,320 --> 02:13:04,038
Why had I better not?

2081
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:05,713
Because I'm still sheriff.

2082
02:13:05,800 --> 02:13:08,553
You wear those things in public,
I'll arrest you.

2083
02:13:12,680 --> 02:13:13,829
John T.

2084
02:13:16,280 --> 02:13:18,840
I've waited so long for you to say that.

2085
02:13:19,480 --> 02:13:21,038
I thought you were never...

2086
02:13:21,120 --> 02:13:23,475
You have the funniest way
of saying things.

2087
02:13:23,560 --> 02:13:25,551
Just when I think
you're gonna say one thing...

2088
02:13:25,640 --> 02:13:28,632
All right, get those darn things off.
I'll wait outside.

2089
02:13:28,720 --> 02:13:31,792
No, you don't have to go.
I can use this screen.

2090
02:13:32,520 --> 02:13:34,351
Besides, I want you to stay here

2091
02:13:34,440 --> 02:13:37,238
'cause the other thing is all over now,
isn't it?

2092
02:13:37,480 --> 02:13:39,710
I'm trying to hurry, but I'm all thumbs.

2093
02:13:40,360 --> 02:13:42,237
What I had to go through!

2094
02:13:42,640 --> 02:13:45,996
Put on these tights,
ask a lot of questions,

2095
02:13:46,080 --> 02:13:49,470
start to walk out.
I thought you were never gonna say it.

2096
02:13:49,560 --> 02:13:50,834
Say what?

2097
02:13:50,920 --> 02:13:52,239
That you loved me.

2098
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:54,072
I said I'd arrest you.

2099
02:13:54,360 --> 02:13:57,796
It means the same thing. You know that.
You just won't say it.

2100
02:13:58,160 --> 02:14:00,958
We're different.
I'll have to get used to you.

2101
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:03,156
Me, I just talk all the time.

2102
02:14:03,240 --> 02:14:04,992
You most certainly do.

2103
02:14:05,120 --> 02:14:07,793
You'll get used to that. You'll have to.

2104
02:14:07,880 --> 02:14:10,189
Either that or start talking, too.

2105
02:14:12,360 --> 02:14:13,952
Tell me something.

2106
02:14:14,240 --> 02:14:18,028
These tights, now why didn't you want me
to wear them?

2107
02:14:18,520 --> 02:14:21,512
Because I didn't want anybody but me
to see you in them.

2108
02:14:21,840 --> 02:14:23,159
I like that.

2109
02:14:23,640 --> 02:14:25,471
You're getting better already.

2110
02:14:25,800 --> 02:14:28,951
Shall I save them
and wear them just for you?

2111
02:14:42,600 --> 02:14:44,716
Do you think I'll ever get to be
a sheriff?

2112
02:14:44,800 --> 02:14:46,597
Not unless you mind your own business.

2113
02:15:13,320 --> 02:15:14,389
