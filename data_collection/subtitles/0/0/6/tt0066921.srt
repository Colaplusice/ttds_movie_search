{1}{1}25.000
{2441}{2482}There was me.
{2493}{2558}That is, Alex,|and my three droogs.
{2564}{2652}That is, Pete, Georgie and Dim.
{2661}{2747}And we sat in the Korova Milk Bar,|trying to make up our rassoodocks...
{2753}{2807}... what to do with the evening.
{2848}{2922}The Korova Milk Bar sold milk plus.
{2928}{3015}Milk plus vellocet or|synthemesc or drencrom...
{3021}{3069}... which is what we were drinking.
{3082}{3115}This would sharpen you up...
{3121}{3215}...and make you ready for a bit|of the old ultra-violence.
{3320}{3404}In Dublin's fair city
{3420}{3519}Where the girls are so pretty
{3545}{3618}I first set my eyes
{3644}{3730}On sweet Molly Malone
{3757}{3869}As she wheeled her wheelbarrow
{3875}{3980}Through streets broad and narrow
{3986}{4093}Crying, "Cockles and mussels... "
{4115}{4165}One thing I could never stand...
{4171}{4229}... was to see a filthy,|dirty old drunkie...
{4235}{4299}...howling away at the|filthy songs of his fathers...
{4305}{4361}...and going "blerp blerp"|in between...
{4367}{4469}...as it might be a filthy old|orchestra in his stinking guts.
{4475}{4561}I could never stand to see anyone|like that, whatever his age.
{4567}{4643}But more especially when he|was real old, like this one was.
{4826}{4923}Can you spare some cutter,|me brothers?
{4999}{5121}Go on! Do me in, you bastard cowards!|I don't want to live anyway.
{5127}{5195}Not in a stinking world|like this.
{5261}{5337}And what's so stinking about it?
{5343}{5445}It's a stinking world because|there's no law and order anymore!
{5451}{5525}It stinks because it lets|the young get onto the old...
{5531}{5580}...like you done!
{5586}{5702}It's no world|for an old man any longer.
{5716}{5798}What kind of a world is it|at all?
{5804}{5849}Men on the moon.
{5855}{5915}Men spinning around the earth.
{5921}{5994}And there's not no|attention paid...
{5999}{6084}...to earthly|law and order no more.
{6093}{6155}Oh, dear land
{6164}{6220}I fought for thee
{7065}{7156}It was at the derelict casino|that we came across Billy-boy...
{7162}{7211}...and his four droogs.
{7219}{7277}They were about to perform|a little of the old...
{7283}{7378}...in-out, in-out on a weepy|young devotchka they had there.
{8580}{8649}Well, if it isn't fat, stinking...
{8655}{8758}...billy goat|Billy-boy in poison.
{8778}{8817}How are thou...
{8823}{8914}...thou globby bottle of cheap,|stinking chip-oil?
{8956}{9018}Come and get one in the yarbles...
{9024}{9069}...if you have any yarbles...
{9075}{9147}...you eunuch jelly, thou.
{9230}{9270}Let's get them, boys!
{10662}{10696}The police!
{10710}{10750}Come on. Let's go!
{11252}{11361}The Durango 95 purred away|real horrorshow.
{11367}{11469}A nice, warm vibratey feeling|all through your guttiwuts.
{11475}{11551}Soon it was trees and dark,|my brothers...
{11557}{11618}... with real country dark.
{12502}{12578}We fillied around with other|travelers of the night...
{12584}{12640}...playing Hogs of the Road.
{12646}{12694}Then we headed west.
{12700}{12788}What we were after now|was the old surprise visit.
{12794}{12824}That was a real kick...
{12830}{12937}...and good for laughs and|lashing of the old ultra-violent.
{14098}{14146}Who on earth could that be?
{14364}{14402}I'll go and see.
{14660}{14700}Yes, who is it?
{14705}{14802}Excuse me, can you please help?|There's been a terrible accident!
{14828}{14930}My friend's bleeding to death!|Can I please use your telephone?
{14936}{15014}We don't have a telephone.|You'll have to go somewhere else.
{15020}{15085}But, missus, it's a matter|of life and death!
{15091}{15122}Who is it, dear?
{15128}{15189}A young man.|He says there's been an accident.
{15195}{15259}He wants to use the telephone.
{15283}{15343}I suppose you better let him in.
{15367}{15411}Wait a minute, will you?
{15463}{15542}I'm sorry, but we don't usually|let strangers in...
{15832}{15877}What do you want from me?
{15967}{16033}Pete, check the rest|of the house. Dim...
{16150}{16204}I'm singing in the rain
{16229}{16275}Just singing in the rain
{16295}{16338}What a glorious feeling
{16360}{16396}I'm happy again
{16429}{16473}I'm laughing at clouds
{16500}{16533}So dark up above
{16567}{16605}The sun's in my heart
{16639}{16683}And I'm ready for love
{16722}{16776}Let the stormy clouds chase
{16797}{16843}Everyone from the place
{16900}{16931}Come on with the rain
{16954}{17005}I've a smile on my face
{17029}{17078}I'll walk down the lane
{17102}{17149}With a happy refrain
{17175}{17220}And I'm singing
{17235}{17270}Just singing...
{17322}{17350}...in the rain
{18951}{18986}Viddy well, little brother.
{18992}{19032}Viddy well.
{19520}{19612}We were all feeling a bit|shagged and fagged and fashed...
{19618}{19728}...it having been an evening|of some small energy expenditure.
{19734}{19853}So we got rid of the auto and|stopped at the Korova for a nightcap.
{20005}{20040}Hello, Lucy.
{20067}{20108}Had a busy night?
{20149}{20206}We've been working hard too.
{20263}{20307}Pardon me, Luce.
{20490}{20576}There was some sophistos from|the TV studios around the corner...
{20582}{20635}...laughing and govoreeting.
{20643}{20766}The devotchka smeched away, not|caring about the wicked world one bit.
{20785}{20866}Then the disk on the stereo|twanged off and out.
{20872}{20951}And in the short silence|before the next one came on...
{20957}{21033}...she suddenly came|with a burst of singing.
{21125}{21181}And it was like, for a moment,|O my brothers...
{21187}{21265}...some great bird|had flown into the milk bar.
{21271}{21349}And I felt all the malenky|little hairs on my plott...
{21355}{21400}...standing endwise.
{21409}{21507}And the shivers crawling up|like slow, malenky lizards...
{21513}{21552}...and then down again.
{21558}{21623}Because I knew what she sang.
{21629}{21711}It was a bit from|the glorious Ninth, by Ludwig van.
{21922}{21973}What did you do that for?
{21979}{22028}For being a bastard|with no manners.
{22034}{22150}Without a dook of an idea about how|to comport yourself public-wise.
{22205}{22272}I don't like you should|do what you done.
{22283}{22365}And I'm not your brother no more|and wouldn't want to be.
{22448}{22480}Watch that.
{22504}{22627}Do watch that, if to continue|to be on live thou dost wish.
{22674}{22704}Yarbles!
{22710}{22776}Great, bouncy yarblockos to you!
{22786}{22875}I'll meet you with chain|or nozh or britva anytime.
{22881}{22945}I'm not having you aiming|tolchocks at me reasonless.
{22956}{23025}It stands to reason,|I won't have it.
{23138}{23220}A nozh scrap anytime you say.
{23577}{23618}Doobidoob.
{23672}{23719}A bit tired maybe.
{23769}{23813}Best not to say more.
{23846}{23905}Bedways is rightways now.
{23918}{23993}So best we go homeways|and get a bit of spatchka.
{24000}{24034}Right, right?
{24328}{24393}Where I lived was with|my dada and mum...
{24399}{24505}...in municipal flat block|18-A, Linear North.
{26562}{26609}It had been a wonderful evening.
{26615}{26700}And what I needed now|to give it the perfect ending...
{26706}{26777}... was a bit|of the old Ludwig van.
{27978}{28010}Oh, bliss!
{28024}{28074}Bliss and heaven!
{28086}{28196}It was gorgeousness and|gorgeosity made flesh.
{28215}{28312}It was like a bird|of rarest spun heaven metal.
{28318}{28401}Or like silvery wine|flowing in a spaceship...
{28407}{28474}...gravity all nonsense now.
{28486}{28521}As I slooshied...
{28527}{28600}...I knew such lovely pictures.
{29067}{29103}Alex. Alex!
{29276}{29311}What do you want?
{29317}{29354}It's past eight, Alex.
{29360}{29434}You don't want to be|late for school, son.
{29469}{29532}Bit of a pain in the gulliver, Mum.
{29538}{29599}Leave us be,|and I'll try and sleep it off.
{29605}{29671}And then I'll be as right|as dodgers for this after.
{29694}{29768}But you've not been|to school all week, son.
{29774}{29802}Got to rest, Mum.
{29816}{29858}Got to get fit.
{29869}{29953}Otherwise, I'm liable|to miss a lot more school.
{29959}{30081}I'll put your breakfast in the oven.|I've got to be off meself now.
{30108}{30208}All right, Mum.|Have a nice day at the factory.
{30312}{30387}He's not feeling too good|again this morning, Dad.
{30393}{30437}Yes. Yes, I heard.
{30449}{30484}You know what time he got in?
{30491}{30562}No, I don't.|I'd taken me sleepers.
{30626}{30662}I wonder...
{30672}{30769}...where exactly is it|he goes to work of evenings.
{30821}{30855}Like he says...
{30861}{30917}...it's mostly odd things he does.
{30923}{30951}Helping-like...
{30957}{31021}...here and there, as it might be.
{32019}{32067}Hi, hi, hi, Mr. Deltoid.
{32073}{32119}Funny surprise, seeing you here.
{32125}{32219}Alex-boy!|Awake at last, yes?
{32234}{32306}I met your mother|on the way to work, yes?
{32312}{32361}She gave me the key.
{32428}{32481}She said something about|a pain somewhere.
{32487}{32558}Hence, not at school, yes?
{32566}{32642}A rather intolerable pain|in the head, brother sir.
{32648}{32699}It should be clear|by this afterlunch.
{32720}{32782}Or certainly by this evening, yes.
{32788}{32865}The evening's the great time,|isn't it, Alex-boy?
{32871}{32956}-Cup of the old chai, sir?|-No time, no time.
{32962}{33000}Sit, sit, sit!
{33038}{33104}To what do I owe|this extreme pleasure, sir?
{33122}{33150}Anything wrong, sir?
{33156}{33248}Wrong? Why should you|think of anything being wrong?
{33254}{33311}Have you been doing|something you shouldn't?
{33317}{33348}Just a manner of speech.
{33354}{33427}Yes, well, it's just a manner|of speech from your...
{33433}{33511}...post-corrective advisor to you|that you watch out, little Alex.
{33517}{33602}Because next time it's not|going to be the corrective school.
{33608}{33711}Next time it'll be the Barley place,|and all my work ruined.
{33717}{33760}If you've no respect|for yourself...
{33766}{33840}...you at least might have some|for me, who sweated over you.
{33846}{33944}A big, black mark, I tell you,|for every one we don't reclaim.
{33950}{34027}A confession of failure|for every one of you...
{34033}{34103}...who ends up in the stripy hole.
{34109}{34153}I've been doing nothing I shouldn't.
{34159}{34222}The millicents have nothing|on me, brother.
{34228}{34259}Sir, I mean.
{34265}{34326}Cut out this clever talk|about millicents.
{34332}{34385}Just because the police|haven't picked you up...
{34391}{34468}...doesn't mean that you've not|been up to some nastiness.
{34474}{34597}There was a bit of nastiness last night.|Some very extreme nastiness, yes?
{34603}{34703}A few of a certain Billy-boy's|friends were ambulanced off late.
{34709}{34743}Your name was mentioned.
{34749}{34802}The words got to me|by the usual channels.
{34808}{34876}Certain friends of yours|were named also.
{34882}{34959}Nobody can prove anything|about anybody, as usual.
{34965}{35003}I'm warning you, little Alex...
{35009}{35063}...being a good friend|to you as always...
{35069}{35135}...the one man in this|sore and sick community...
{35141}{35206}...who wants to save you|from yourself!
{35671}{35712}What gets into you all?
{35718}{35797}We've been studying the problem|for damn well near a century.
{35803}{35854}But we get no farther|with our studies.
{35860}{35920}You got a good home here.|Good, loving parents.
{35926}{35977}You've got not too bad of a brain.
{35983}{36059}Is it some devil|that crawls inside of you?
{36065}{36110}Nobody's got anything on me.
{36116}{36182}I been out of the millicents'|rookers for a long time.
{36188}{36296}That's just what worries me.|A bit too long to be safe.
{36302}{36346}You're about due, by my reckoning.
{36352}{36383}That's why I'm warning you...
{36389}{36473}...to keep your handsome|young proboscis out of the dirt.
{36479}{36511}Do I make myself clear?
{36517}{36551}As an unmuddied lake, sir.
{36557}{36638}As clear as an azure sky|of deepest summer.
{36644}{36699}You can rely on me, sir.
{38285}{38323}Excuse me, brother.
{38329}{38416}I ordered this two weeks ago.|Can you see if it's arrived?
{38449}{38480}Just a minute.
{39110}{39150}Pardon me, ladies.
{39356}{39419}Enjoying that, are you, my darling?
{39481}{39561}A bit cold and pointless,|isn't it, my lovely?
{39665}{39735}What's happened to yours,|my little sister?
{39787}{39822}Who you getting, bratty?
{39828}{39879}Goggly Gogol?|Johnny Zhivago?
{39885}{39930}The Heaven 17?
{40033}{40125}What you got back home|to play your fuzzy warbles on?
{40131}{40233}I bet you've got little|pitiful, portable picnic players.
{40239}{40291}Come with Uncle|and hear all proper.
{40297}{40370}Hear angel trumpets|and devil trombones.
{40376}{40425}You are invited.
{42400}{42423}Hi, hi, hi, there.
{42429}{42453}Well, hello.
{42459}{42522}He are here!|He have arrived!
{42528}{42566}Hooray!
{42582}{42649}Welly, welly, welly,|welly, welly, welly, well!
{42689}{42803}To what do I owe the extreme pleasure|of this surprising visit?
{42931}{42972}We got worried.
{43041}{43158}There we were, waiting and drinking|away at the old knifey moloko...
{43175}{43225}...and you had not turned up.
{43235}{43288}And we thought|you might have been, like...
{43294}{43350}...offended by something|or other.
{43356}{43413}So around we come to your abode.
{43543}{43596}Appy polly loggies.
{43603}{43678}I had something of a pain|in the gulliver, so I had to sleep.
{43684}{43752}I was not awakened|when I gave orders for wakening.
{43758}{43816}Sorry about the pain.
{43833}{43893}Using the gulliver|too much-like, maybe.
{43970}{44053}Giving orders and|discipline and such, perhaps.
{44064}{44120}You sure the pain is gone?
{44131}{44205}You sure you'd not|be happier back in bed?
{44720}{44823}Let's get things nice|and sparkling clear.
{44904}{44963}This sarcasm,|if I may call it such...
{44969}{45035}...does not become you,|my little brothers.
{45048}{45154}As I am your droog and leader|I'm entitled to know what goes on.
{45199}{45228}Now then, Dim.
{45234}{45334}What does that great big|horsey gape of a grin portend?
{45382}{45472}All right, no more|picking on Dim, brother.
{45478}{45536}That's part of the new way.
{45723}{45817}New way?|What's this about a new way?
{45848}{45966}There's been some very large talk|behind my sleeping back, I know it.
{45999}{46069}If you must have it,|have it, then.
{46087}{46151}We go around shop crasting|and the like...
{46157}{46243}...coming out with a pitiful|rookerfull of money each.
{46251}{46305}And Will the English|in the coffee mesto...
{46311}{46398}...saying he can fence anything|any malchick tries to crast.
{46404}{46450}The shiny stuff. The ice!
{46456}{46553}The big, big money's available,|is what Will the English says.
{46602}{46681}And what will you do|with the big, big, big money?
{46687}{46733}Have you not everything you need?
{46739}{46809}If you need a motorcar,|you pluck it from the trees.
{46815}{46888}If you need pretty polly,|you take it.
{46894}{47004}Brother, you think and talk|sometimes like a little child.
{47025}{47086}Tonight we pull a man-size crast.
{47132}{47188}Good! Real horrorshow!
{47194}{47251}Initiative comes|to thems that wait.
{47267}{47339}I've taught you much,|my little droogies.
{47373}{47454}Now tell me what you had in mind,|Georgie-boy.
{47534}{47611}The old moloko plus first.|Would you not say?
{47617}{47708}-Something to sharpen us up.|-Some moloko plus.
{47745}{47860}You got to go there first.|We got a start on you. Moloko Plus!
{48050}{48109}As we walked along|the flatblock marina...
{48115}{48217}...I was calm on the outside,|but thinking all the time.
{48223}{48284}So now it was to be|Georgie the General...
{48290}{48349}...saying what we should do|and what not to do.
{48355}{48449}And Dim as his mindless,|grinning bulldog.
{48455}{48543}But suddenly I viddied that|thinking was for the gloopy ones...
{48549}{48672}...and that the oomny ones used, like,|inspiration and what Bog sends.
{48684}{48776}For now it was lovely music|that came to my aid.
{48782}{48856}There was a window open|with a stereo on...
{48862}{48941}...and I viddied right at once|what to do.
{50512}{50598}I had not cut into any|of Dim's main cables.
{50604}{50658}And so with the help|of a clean tashtook...
{50664}{50721}...the red, red kroovy|soon stopped.
{50727}{50815}And it did not take long to|quieten the two wounded soldiers...
{50821}{50885}...down in the snug|of the Duke of New York.
{50907}{50992}Now they knew who was|master and leader.
{51004}{51050}Sheep, thought I.
{51056}{51108}But a real leader knows|always when, like...
{51114}{51192}...to give and show generous|to his unders.
{51254}{51308}Now we're back to where we were.
{51314}{51346}Yes?
{51366}{51421}Just like before,|and all forgotten?
{51427}{51466}Right, right, right?
{51508}{51535}Right.
{51605}{51631}Right.
{51714}{51739}Right.
{51809}{51861}Well, Georgie-boy...
{51870}{51963}...this idea of yours for tonight.|Tell us all about it, then.
{52003}{52029}Not tonight.
{52035}{52075}Not this nochy.
{52090}{52152}Come, come, come, Georgie-boy.
{52165}{52245}You're a big, strong chelloveck,|like us all.
{52251}{52330}We're not little children,|are we, Georgie-boy?
{52346}{52433}What, then, didst thou|in thy mind have?
{52598}{52643}It's this health farm.
{52670}{52718}A bit out of the town.
{52742}{52778}Isolated.
{52804}{52915}It's owned by this rich ptitsa|who lives there with her cats.
{52930}{53038}The place is shut down for a week|and she's completely on her own.
{53070}{53159}It's full up with, like,|gold and silver...
{53165}{53213}...and, like, jewels.
{53248}{53341}Tell me more, Georgie-boy.|Tell me more.
{53477}{53509}Oh, shit!
{53961}{53981}Who's there?
{53995}{54043}Excuse me, can you please help?
{54049}{54085}There's been a terrible accident!
{54091}{54161}Can I please use your telephone|for an ambulance?
{54187}{54234}I'm frightfully sorry.
{54255}{54341}There's a telephone in the|public house a mile down the road.
{54347}{54390}I suggest you use that.
{54396}{54445}But missus, this is an emergency!
{54451}{54494}It's a matter of life and death!
{54500}{54591}Me friend's lying in the middle|of the road, bleeding to death!
{54613}{54734}I'm very sorry, but I never open|the door to strangers after dark.
{54790}{54833}Very well, madam.
{54843}{54896}You can't be blamed|for being suspicious...
{54902}{54993}...with so many scoundrels|and rogues of the night about.
{54999}{55060}I'll try and get help|at the pub, then.
{55066}{55125}I'm sorry if I disturbed you.
{55131}{55205}Thank you very much.|Good night.
{56082}{56117}Dim, bend down.
{56173}{56243}I'll get in that window|and open the front door.
{56929}{56972}Radlett Police Station?
{56978}{57072}Good evening. It's Miss Weathers|at Woodmere Health Farm.
{57120}{57215}I'm sorry to bother you, but|something rather odd just happened.
{57221}{57289}It's probably nothing at all,|but you never know.
{57311}{57392}A young man rang the bell,|asking to use the telephone.
{57398}{57452}He said there's been|some kind of accident.
{57458}{57517}The thing that caught my|attention was what he said.
{57523}{57616}His words sounded like those quoted|in the papers this morning...
{57622}{57723}...in connection with the writer|and his wife who were assaulted.
{57754}{57803}Just a few minutes ago.
{57857}{57900}If you think that's necessary.
{57906}{57971}But I'm quite sure|he's gone away now.
{58010}{58051}All right, fine.
{58074}{58125}Thank you very much.
{58234}{58273}Hi, hi, hi, there.
{58279}{58311}At last we meet.
{58317}{58429}Our brief govorett through the|letter-hole was not satisfactory.
{58460}{58490}Who are you?
{58520}{58567}How the hell did you get in here?
{58613}{58693}What the bloody hell|do you think you're doing?
{58789}{58832}Naughty, naughty, naughty!
{58838}{58901}You filthy old soomaka.
{58907}{58993}Now listen here,|you little bastard!
{58999}{59082}Just turn round and walk out|of here the same way you came in.
{59159}{59195}Leave that alone!|Don't touch it!
{59201}{59259}It's a very important work of art.
{59518}{59577}What the bloody hell do you want?
{59609}{59678}To be perfectly honest, madam...
{59684}{59764}...l'm taking part in an|international students' contest...
{59770}{59860}...to see who can get the most|points for selling magazines.
{59866}{59917}Cut the shit, sonny...
{59923}{60032}...and get out of here before you|get yourself into serious trouble.
{60040}{60113}I told you to leave that alone!|Now get out of here...
{60119}{60164}...before I throw you out!
{60176}{60244}Wretched, slummy bedbug!
{60257}{60346}I'll teach you to break|into real people's houses.
{60376}{60398}Fucking...
{60404}{60428}...little...
{60442}{60478}...bastard!
{62148}{62219}-Let's go. The police are coming!|-One minoota, droogie.
{62380}{62447}You bastards! I'm blind!
{62453}{62550}I'm blind, you bastards!|I can't see!
{62882}{62959}It's no good sitting there in hope,|my little brothers.
{62964}{63068}I won't say a single solitary|slovo unless I have my lawyer here.
{63076}{63137}I know the law, you bastards.
{63326}{63366}Righty-right, Tom.
{63402}{63495}We'll have to show our friend Alex|here that we know the law too.
{63502}{63565}But that knowing the law|isn't everything.
{63921}{63985}Nasty cut you've got there,|little Alex.
{64010}{64056}Shame, isn't it?
{64077}{64126}Spoils all your beauty.
{64175}{64213}Who gave you that, then?
{64249}{64289}How'd you do that, then?
{64350}{64400}What's your point, you bastard?
{64406}{64459}That is for your lady victim.
{64465}{64495}You ghastly...
{64501}{64543}...wretched scoundrel.
{64599}{64628}Get him off me!
{64651}{64702}You rotten little bastard!
{64900}{64930}Good evening, Mr. Deltoid.
{64936}{64976}Good evening, Sergeant.
{64982}{65008}They're in room B, sir.
{65014}{65054}Thank you very much.
{65078}{65105}Sergeant...
{65111}{65134}Good evening.
{65140}{65176}Good evening, Inspector.
{65182}{65252}-Would you like your tea now, sir?|-No, thank you, Sergeant.
{65258}{65305}May I have some|paper towels, please?
{65311}{65365}We're interrogating|the prisoner now.
{65371}{65457}-Perhaps you'd care to come inside.|-Thank you very much.
{65472}{65543}Good evening, Sergeant.|Good evening, all.
{65591}{65665}Oh, dear! This boy|does look a mess, doesn't he?
{65672}{65716}Just look at the state of him.
{65722}{65769}Love's young nightmare-like.
{65775}{65821}Violence makes violence.
{65827}{65875}He resisted his lawful arrestors.
{65911}{65989}This is the end of the line for me.
{65995}{66071}The end of the line, yes.
{66079}{66114}And what of me, brother sir?
{66120}{66160}Speak up for me.|I'm not so bad.
{66167}{66214}I was led on by|the treachery of others.
{66221}{66289}Sings the roof off lovely,|he does, sir.
{66296}{66374}Where are my treacherous droogs?|Get them before they get away!
{66380}{66424}It was all their idea, brothers.
{66430}{66494}They forced me to do it.|I'm innocent!
{66655}{66721}You are now a murderer,|little Alex.
{66737}{66769}A murderer.
{66788}{66836}Not true, sir.
{66842}{66885}It was only a slight tolchok.
{66891}{66952}She were breathing, I swear it.
{66962}{67016}I've just come from the hospital.
{67022}{67077}Your victim has died.
{67083}{67159}You try to frighten me.|Admit so, sir.
{67165}{67212}This is some new form of torture.
{67218}{67297}-Say it, brother sir.|-lt'll be your own torture.
{67303}{67394}I hope to God|it'll torture you to madness.
{67438}{67512}If you'd care to give him a bash|in the chops, don't mind us.
{67518}{67561}We'll hold him down.
{67578}{67655}He must be a great|disappointment to you, sir.
{68361}{68449}This is the real weepy and tragic|part of the story beginning...
{68455}{68508}...O my brothers and only friends.
{68514}{68573}After a trial,|with judges and a jury...
{68579}{68681}...and hard words spoken against|your friend and humble narrator...
{68687}{68785}...he was sentenced to 14 years|in Staja Number 84-F...
{68791}{68876}...among smelly perverts|and hardened prestoopniks.
{68882}{68974}The shock sending my dada beating|his bruised and krovvy rookers...
{68980}{69036}...against unfair Bog|in His Heaven.
{69042}{69119}And my mum boo-hoo-hooing|in her mother's grief...
{69125}{69182}...at her only child|and son of her bosom...
{69188}{69251}...like, letting everybody down|real horrorshow.
{69257}{69326}Morning.|One up from Thames, mister.
{69351}{69390}Right! Open up the cell!
{69396}{69430}Yes, sir.

{70929}{70970}-Thank you.|-Let the officer out.
{71073}{71133}All right, empty your pockets.
{71222}{71297}Are you able to see the white line|painted on the floor...
{71303}{71335}...directly behind you...
{71341}{71373}...655321?
{71433}{71467}Then your toes belong...
{71473}{71520}...on the other side of it!
{71688}{71729}-Yes, sir.|-Right.
{71739}{71771}Carry on.

{73872}{73922}The tobacco and chocolate|you brought in...
{73928}{73959}...you lose that...
{73965}{74015}...as you are now convicted.
{74036}{74113}Now over to the table|and get undressed.
{74282}{74330}Were you in police custody|this morning?
{74336}{74372}One jacket, blue pinstriped.

{76049}{76085}Crabs? Lice?
{76091}{76163}-Through there for the bath.|-One for a bath.
{76212}{76243}What's it going to be, eh?
{76264}{76348}Is it going to be in and out|of institutions like this...
{76354}{76402}...though more in than out|for most of you?
{76408}{76506}Or are you going to attend|to the divine word...
{76512}{76601}...and realize the punishments|that await unrepentant sinners...
{76607}{76657}...in the next world|as well as this?
{76663}{76712}A lot of idiots you are...
{76718}{76830}...selling your birthright|for a saucer of cold porridge.
{76836}{76877}The thrill of theft.
{76883}{76903}Of violence.
{76909}{76973}The urge to live easy.
{76979}{77043}Well, I ask you what is it worth...
{77049}{77105}...when we have undeniable proof...
{77111}{77186}...yes, incontrovertible|evidence...
{77192}{77224}...that hell exists?
{77230}{77259}I know!
{77265}{77326}I know, my friends.
{77332}{77382}I have been informed...
{77388}{77424}...in visions...
{77430}{77465}...that there is a place...
{77471}{77529}...darker than any prison...
{77535}{77632}...hotter than any flame|of human fire...
{77638}{77670}...where souls...
{77676}{77777}...of unrepentant criminal sinners|like yourselves...
{77822}{77910}Don't you laugh, damn you!|Don't you laugh.
{77916}{77988}I say, like yourselves...
{78001}{78032}...scream...
{78042}{78130}...in endless and|unendurable agony.
{78148}{78181}Their skin...
{78187}{78247}...rotting and peeling.
{78253}{78295}A fireball...
{78301}{78357}...spinning in their|screaming guts!
{78363}{78445}I know. Yes, I know!
{78596}{78668}All right, you lot!|We'll end by singing hymn 258...
{78674}{78705}...in the prisoner's hymnal.
{78711}{78788}And let's have a little reverence,|you bastards!
{78828}{78907}I was a wandering sheep
{78933}{78996}-Sing up, damn you!|-I did not love the fold
{79002}{79036}Louder!
{79092}{79212}I did not love my shepherd's voice
{79227}{79332}I would not be controlled
{79359}{79386}Louder!
{79397}{79470}It had not been edifying.|Indeed not.
{79476}{79570}Being in this hellhole|and human zoo for two years now.
{79576}{79651}Being kicked and tolchoked|by brutal warders...
{79657}{79728}...and meeting leering criminals|and perverts...
{79734}{79771}...ready to dribble all over...
{79777}{79847}...a luscious young malchick|like your storyteller.
{79991}{80027}It was my rabbit...
{80033}{80099}...to help the prison charlie|with the Sunday service.
{80105}{80178}He was a bolshy,|great burly bastard.
{80184}{80257}But he was very fond of myself,|me being very young...
{80263}{80345}...and also now very interested|in the Big Book.
{80851}{80943}I read all about the scourging|and the crowning with thorns.
{80949}{80994}And I could viddy myself|helping in...
{81000}{81095}...and even taking charge of|the tolchoking and the nailing in.
{81101}{81181}Being dressed in the height|of Roman fashion.
{81467}{81527}I didn't so much like|the latter part of the Book...
{81533}{81584}... which is more like|all preachy talking...
{81590}{81642}...than fighting|and the old in-out.
{81648}{81723}I like the parts where these old|yahoodies tolchok each other...
{81729}{81783}...and then drink|their Hebrew vino...
{81792}{81865}...and getting onto the bed|with their wives' handmaidens.
{81871}{81920}That kept me going.
{82671}{82741}"Seek not to be like evil men.
{82751}{82802}Neither desire to be with them...
{82808}{82882}...because their minds|studieth robberies...
{82888}{82958}...and their lips speak deceits."
{82964}{83048}If thou lose hope, being weary|in the days of distress...
{83054}{83108}...thy strength|shall be diminished.
{83114}{83154}Fine, my son. Fine.
{83160}{83190}Father?
{83287}{83329}I have tried, have I not?
{83335}{83361}You have, my son.
{83367}{83423}-I've done my best, have I not?|-lndeed.
{83429}{83510}I've never been guilty of any|institutional infraction, have I?
{83516}{83620}You certainly have not, 655321 .|You've been very helpful.
{83626}{83695}And you've shown|a genuine desire to reform.
{83701}{83732}Father...
{83767}{83834}...can I ask you|a question in private?
{83873}{83919}Certainly, my son. Certainly.
{84163}{84224}Is there something|troubling you, my son?
{84299}{84354}Don't be shy to speak up.
{84414}{84446}Remember...
{84452}{84499}...I know of the...
{84505}{84597}...urges that can|trouble young men...
{84603}{84639}...deprived...
{84645}{84693}...of the society of women.
{84762}{84818}It's nothing like that, Father.
{84908}{84989}It's about this new thing|they're all talking about.
{85002}{85042}About this new treatment.
{85048}{85104}It gets you out of prison|in no time.
{85110}{85172}And makes sure you|never get back in again.
{85191}{85245}Where did you hear about this?
{85251}{85315}Who's been talking|about these things?
{85322}{85380}These things get around.
{85386}{85440}Two warders talk, as it might be.
{85446}{85519}And somebody can't help|overhearing what they say.
{85532}{85613}Then somebody picks up a scrap|of newspaper in the workshops...
{85619}{85681}...and the newspaper|tells all about it.
{85752}{85841}How about putting me in|for this new treatment?
{85880}{85968}I take it you are referring...
{85974}{86028}...to the Ludovico technique.
{86046}{86102}I don't know what it's called.
{86108}{86153}I just know it|gets you out quickly...
{86159}{86219}...and makes sure you|never get back in again.
{86236}{86304}That is not proven, 655321 .
{86310}{86410}In fact, it is only in the|experimental stage at this moment.
{86421}{86487}It has been used, hasn't it?
{86493}{86559}It has not been used|in this prison yet.
{86565}{86624}The governor has grave|doubts about it.
{86630}{86719}And I've heard there are|very serious dangers involved.
{86767}{86835}I don't care about the dangers.
{86876}{86928}I just want to be good.
{86958}{87022}I want for the rest|of my life to be...
{87028}{87078}...one act of goodness.
{87084}{87119}The question is...
{87129}{87240}...whether or not this technique|really makes a man good.
{87260}{87315}Goodness comes from within.
{87321}{87348}Goodness...
{87354}{87387}...is chosen.
{87396}{87447}When a man cannot choose...
{87453}{87504}...he ceases to be a man.
{87547}{87665}I don't understand about|the whys and wherefores, Father.
{87694}{87764}I only know I want to be good.
{87815}{87861}Be patient, my son.
{87867}{87921}Put your trust in the Lord.
{87967}{88053}Instruct Thy Son|and He shall refresh thee...
{88059}{88128}...and shall give delight|to thy soul.
{88143}{88173}Amen.
{88839}{88886}-Mister!|-All present and correct, sir!
{88892}{88917}Right!
{88955}{89005}All present and correct, sir!
{90337}{90374}Prisoners, halt!
{90387}{90426}Now pay attention!
{90443}{90485}I want you in two lines...
{90491}{90555}...up against that wall,|facing this way.
{90561}{90598}Go on, move!
{90610}{90634}Hurry up!
{90640}{90671}Stop talking!
{90811}{90873}Prisoners ready|for inspection, sir!
{91256}{91284}How many to a cell?
{91290}{91335}Four in this block, sir.
{91356}{91410}Cram criminals together|and what do you get?
{91416}{91492}Concentrated criminality.|Crime in the midst of punishment.
{91498}{91586}I agree, sir. We need|larger prisons, more money.
{91592}{91635}Not a chance, my dear fellow.
{91641}{91697}The government can't be|concerned any longer...
{91703}{91744}...with outmoded|penalogical theories.
{91751}{91838}Soon we may need all prison|space for political offenders.
{91844}{91929}Common criminals are best dealt|with on a purely curative basis.
{91935}{92000}Kill the criminal reflex,|that's all.
{92006}{92059}Full implementation|in a year's time.
{92065}{92119}Punishment means nothing to them.
{92125}{92195}They enjoy their|so-called punishment.
{92202}{92229}You're absolutely right, sir.
{92235}{92297}Shut your bleeding hole!
{92312}{92349}Who said that?
{92364}{92398}I did, sir.
{92548}{92589}What crime did you commit?
{92595}{92645}The accidental killing|of a person, sir.
{92651}{92716}He brutally murdered a woman|in furtherance of theft.
{92722}{92761}Fourteen years, sir.
{92792}{92820}Excellent.
{92857}{92885}He's enterprising...
{92891}{92917}...aggressive...
{92923}{92951}...outgoing...
{92957}{92977}...young...
{92983}{93014}...bold...
{93020}{93056}...vicious.
{93068}{93093}He'll do.
{93099}{93126}Fine.
{93132}{93168}We could still look at C-block.
{93174}{93223}No, no. That's enough.|He's perfect.
{93229}{93270}I want his records sent to me.
{93276}{93308}This vicious young hoodlum...
{93314}{93360}...will be transformed|out of all recognition.
{93366}{93413}Thank you very much|for this chance.
{93419}{93486}Let's hope you make|the most of it, my boy.
{93493}{93553}-Shall we go to my office?|-Thank you.
{93716}{93747}Come in.
{93790}{93810}Sir!
{93816}{93861}655321 . Sir!
{93867}{93891}Very good, Chief.
{93897}{93934}Over to the line.|Toes behind it.
{93940}{94000}Full name and number|to the governor.
{94020}{94097}Alexander DeLarge, sir.|655321, sir.
{94161}{94236}I don't suppose you know who|that was this morning.
{94242}{94329}That was no less a personage|than the Minister of the Interior.
{94335}{94382}The new Minister of the Interior.
{94388}{94458}What they call a very new broom.
{94486}{94569}These new ridiculous ideas|have come at last.
{94575}{94630}And orders are orders...
{94636}{94721}...though I may say to you|in confidence, I do not approve.
{94727}{94781}An eye for an eye, I say.
{94787}{94858}If someone hits you,|you hit back, do you not?
{94864}{94953}Why should not the state,|severely hit by you hooligans...
{94959}{95002}...not hit back also?
{95023}{95070}The new view is to say "no."
{95076}{95157}The new view is that|we turn the bad into good.
{95163}{95234}All of which seems to me|to be grossly unjust.
{95244}{95305}Shut your filthy hole, you scum!
{95316}{95369}You are to be reformed.
{95389}{95449}Tomorrow you will go|to this man, Brodsky.
{95455}{95493}You will be leaving here.
{95499}{95601}You will be transferred to|the Ludovico medical facility.
{95608}{95702}It's believed you'll be able to|leave state custody in a fortnight.
{95708}{95753}I suppose that prospect|pleases you?
{95759}{95802}Answer the governor's question!
{95808}{95840}Yes, sir.|Thank you very much.
{95846}{95902}I've done my best here,|I really have, sir.
{95908}{95962}I'm very grateful|to all concerned, sir.
{96015}{96073}Sign this where it's marked.
{96149}{96198}Don't read it, sign it!
{96205}{96293}It says you're willing to have|your sentence commuted...
{96299}{96370}...to submission to|the Ludovico treatment.
{96376}{96408}And this.
{96580}{96618}And another copy.
{96919}{96963}The next morning I was taken to...
{96969}{97009}...the Ludovico medical facility...
{97015}{97059}...outside the town center.
{97065}{97101}I felt a malenky bit sad...
{97107}{97153}...having to say goodbye|to the old Staja...
{97159}{97237}...as you will, when you leave|a place you've gotten used to.
{97243}{97290}Right, halt the prisoner.
{97422}{97481}Good morning, sir.|I'm Chief Officer Barnes.
{97487}{97530}I've got 655321 ...
{97536}{97624}...on a transfer from Parkmoor|to the Ludovico Centre, sir.
{97632}{97694}Good morning.|Yes, we've been expecting you.
{97700}{97731}I'm Dr. Alcot.
{97786}{97809}Dr. Alcot.
{97815}{97848}Very good, sir.
{97938}{98013}-Are you prepared for the prisoner?|-Yes, of course.
{98019}{98115}I wonder if you'd mind signing|these documents, sir.
{98136}{98170}There, sir.
{98445}{98479}And there, sir.
{98610}{98648}And there.
{99102}{99139}There you are.
{99190}{99236}Prison escort, move forward!
{99312}{99340}Halt!
{99390}{99431}Excuse me, sir.
{99588}{99666}Is that the officer who will|take charge of the prisoner?
{99895}{99979}A word of advice, doc.|You'll have to watch this one.
{99985}{100070}A right brutal bastard he has been,|and will be again...
{100076}{100152}...in spite of all his sucking up|and reading the Bible.
{100158}{100246}We can manage things.|Show the young man to his room.
{100252}{100318}Right, sir. Come this way, please.
{100528}{100590}-Morning, Charlie.|-Good morning, Doctor.
{100620}{100645}Good morning, Alex.
{100651}{100713}My name is Dr. Branom.|I'm Dr. Brodsky's assistant.
{100719}{100758}Good morning, missus.|Lovely day.
{100764}{100794}Indeed, it is.
{100800}{100838}May I take that?
{100926}{100986}-How are you feeling?|-Fine, fine.
{100992}{101063}Good. In a few minutes|you'll meet Dr. Brodsky...
{101069}{101100}...and begin your treatment.
{101113}{101175}You're a very lucky boy|to have been chosen.
{101221}{101282}I realize that,|and I'm very grateful.
{101290}{101341}We're going to be friends,|aren't we?
{101347}{101379}I hope so, missus.
{101454}{101512}What's the hypo for?|Sending me to sleep?
{101518}{101549}Nothing of the sort.
{101560}{101625}-Vitamins will it be, then?|-Something like that.
{101637}{101732}You're undernourished, so after|each meal we'll give you a shot.
{101738}{101773}Roll over on your right side.
{101779}{101847}Loosen your pajama pants|and pull them halfway down.
{102085}{102158}What exactly is the treatment here|going to be, then?
{102184}{102228}It's quite simple, really.
{102242}{102285}We're going to show you some films.
{102291}{102347}You mean like|going to the pictures?
{102358}{102397}Something like that.
{102403}{102423}That's good.
{102429}{102496}I like to viddy|the old films now and again.
{102545}{102604}And viddy films I would.
{102616}{102663}Where I was taken to, brothers...
{102669}{102721}... was like no cine|I ever viddied before.
{102731}{102782}I was bound up|in a straitjacket...
{102788}{102841}...and my gulliver was strapped|to a headrest...
{102847}{102902}... with wires running away from it.
{102908}{102963}Then they clamped, like,|lid-locks on me eyes...
{102969}{103052}...so that I could not shut them,|no matter how hard I tried.
{103058}{103100}It seemed a bit crazy to me...
{103106}{103175}...but I let them get on with|what they wanted to get on with.
{103181}{103262}If I was to be a free malchick|again in a fortnight...
{103268}{103350}...I would put up with much|in the meantime, O my brothers.
{103961}{104041}The first film was a very good,|professional piece of cine...
{104047}{104093}...like it was done in Hollywood.
{104099}{104150}The sounds were real horrorshow.
{104156}{104232}You could slooshy the screams|and moans very realistic.
{104238}{104293}You could even get|the breathing and panting...
{104299}{104370}...of the tolchocking malchicks|at the same time.
{104376}{104421}And then what do you know?
{104427}{104478}Soon our dear old friend...
{104484}{104532}...the red, red vino on tap...
{104538}{104565}...the same in all places...
{104571}{104606}...like it's put out|by the same firm...
{104620}{104658}...began to flow.
{104664}{104716}It was beautiful.
{104725}{104780}It's funny how the colors|of the real world...
{104790}{104834}...only seem really real...
{104840}{104893}... when you viddy them|on a screen.
{104963}{105022}Now, all the time|I was watching this...
{105028}{105082}...I was beginning|to get very aware...
{105088}{105140}...of, like, not feeling|all that well.
{105146}{105239}And this I put down|to all the rich food and vitamins.
{105245}{105349}But I tried to forget this,|concentrating on the next film...
{105355}{105419}... which jumped right away|on a young devotchka...
{105425}{105493}... who was being given|the old in-out, in-out...
{105514}{105565}...first by one malchick...
{105584}{105613}...then another.
{105637}{105675}Then another.
{105746}{105804}When it came to|the 6th or 7th malchick...
{105810}{105894}...leering and smecking|and then going into it...
{105900}{105977}...I began to feel really sick.
{105990}{106052}But I could not shut me glazzies.
{106058}{106140}And even if I tried to move|my glazzballs about...
{106146}{106194}...I still could not get out of...
{106200}{106264}...the line of fire|of this picture.
{106330}{106368}Get me up.
{106377}{106420}I'm going to be sick.
{106444}{106493}Get something for me to be sick in!
{106596}{106664}Very soon now,|the drug will cause the subject...
{106670}{106724}...to experience|a deathlike paralysis...
{106730}{106822}...together with deep feelings|of terror and helplessness.
{106843}{106935}One of our early test subjects|described it as being like death.
{106941}{107011}A sense of stifling or drowning.
{107029}{107093}And it is during this period,|we have found...
{107099}{107186}...the subject will make|his most rewarding associations...
{107192}{107282}...between his catastrophic|experience, environment...
{107288}{107353}...and the violence he sees.
{107403}{107450}Dr. Brodsky is pleased with you.
{107456}{107513}You've made|a very positive response.
{107540}{107633}Tomorrow there will be two|sessions, morning and afternoon.
{107639}{107711}You mean I have to viddy|two sessions in one day?
{107717}{107793}I imagine you'll feel a bit|limp by the end of the day.
{107799}{107879}But we have to be hard on you.|You have to be cured.
{107885}{107910}It was horrible.
{107916}{107954}Of course it was horrible.
{107960}{108018}Violence is a very horrible thing.
{108024}{108065}That's what you're learning now.
{108071}{108101}Your body's learning it.
{108116}{108182}I just don't understand about|feeling sick the way I did.
{108188}{108266}I never used to feel sick.|I used to feel the very opposite.
{108272}{108342}Doing it or watching it,|I used to feel real horrorshow.
{108364}{108447}You felt ill this afternoon|because you're getting better.
{108453}{108529}When we're healthy,|we respond to the hateful...
{108535}{108583}...with fear and nausea.
{108589}{108641}You're becoming healthy,|that's all.
{108647}{108721}By this time tomorrow,|you'll be healthier still.
{109984}{110033}It was the next day, brothers...
{110039}{110076}...and I had truly done my best...
{110082}{110141}...morning and afternoon|to play it their way...
{110147}{110213}...and sit like a horrorshow|cooperative malchick...
{110219}{110255}...in the chair of torture...
{110261}{110363}... while they flashed nasty bits|of ultra-violence on the screen...
{110374}{110481}...though not on the soundtrack,|the only sound being music.
{110505}{110567}Then I noticed,|in all my pain and sickness...
{110573}{110667}... what music it was|that, like, cracked and boomed.
{110689}{110749}It was Ludwig van.
{110762}{110823}Ninth Symphony, fourth movement.
{111199}{111272}Stop it! Stop it!|Please, I beg you!
{111284}{111314}It's a sin!
{111323}{111361}It's a sin!
{111493}{111519}Sin?
{111525}{111563}What's all this about sin?
{111575}{111596}That!
{111602}{111698}Using Ludwig van like that.|He did no harm to anyone.
{111704}{111762}Beethoven just wrote music.
{111778}{111854}Are you referring|to the background score?
{111892}{111938}You've heard Beethoven before?
{111991}{112036}So you're keen on music?
{112165}{112207}Can't be helped.
{112226}{112293}Here's the punishment|element perhaps.
{112317}{112368}The governor ought to be pleased.
{112434}{112480}I'm sorry, Alex.
{112487}{112529}This is for your own good.
{112535}{112592}You'll have to bear with us|for a while.
{112611}{112700}But it's not fair.|It's not fair I should feel ill...
{112705}{112776}...when I hear lovely,|lovely Ludwig van.
{112789}{112845}You must take your chance, boy.
{112856}{112916}The choice has been all yours.
{112952}{113018}You needn't take it|any further, sir.
{113026}{113096}You've proved to me all this|ultra-violence and killing...
{113102}{113180}...is wrong, wrong|and terribly wrong!
{113190}{113232}I've learned me lesson, sir.
{113238}{113308}I see now what I've|never seen before.
{113314}{113385}I'm cured. Praise God!
{113392}{113450}You're not cured yet, boy.
{113471}{113505}But, sirs.
{113511}{113544}Missus!
{113552}{113603}I see that it's wrong!
{113609}{113706}It's wrong because|it's, like, against society.
{113712}{113776}Because everybody has the|right to live and be happy...
{113782}{113849}...without being|tolchocked and knifed!
{113855}{113929}No, no, boy.|You really must leave it to us.
{113935}{113975}But be cheerful about it.
{113981}{114060}In less than a fortnight now,|you'll be a free man.
{114981}{115010}Ladies and gentlemen...
{115016}{115085}...at this stage, we introduce|the subject himself.
{115091}{115162}He is, as you will perceive,|fit and well-nourished.
{115168}{115236}He comes straight from a night's|sleep and a good breakfast...
{115242}{115266}...undrugged...
{115272}{115316}...unhypnotized.
{115322}{115410}Tomorrow we send him out with|confidence into the world again...
{115416}{115503}...as decent a lad as you|would meet on a May morning.
{115523}{115589}What a change is here,|ladies and gentlemen.
{115595}{115652}From the hoodlum|the state committed...
{115657}{115724}...to unprofitable punishment|two years ago.
{115729}{115796}Unchanged after two years.
{115814}{115867}Unchanged, do I say?
{115873}{115907}Not quite.
{115913}{116027}Prison taught him the false smile,|the rubbed hands of hypocrisy.
{116033}{116112}The fawning, greased,|obsequious leer.
{116124}{116169}Other vices it taught him...
{116175}{116268}...as well as confirming him in|those he had long practiced before.
{116297}{116370}Our party promised|to restore law and order...
{116376}{116473}...and to make the streets safe for|the ordinary peace-loving citizen.
{116479}{116576}This pledge is now|about to become a reality.
{116582}{116671}Ladies and gentlemen,|today is an historic moment.
{116677}{116785}The problem of criminal violence|is soon to be a thing of the past.
{116809}{116855}But enough of words.
{116861}{116915}Actions speak louder than.
{116921}{116961}Action now.
{116973}{117020}Observe all.
{117251}{117312}Our necks are out|a long way on this, Minister.
{117318}{117369}I have complete faith in Brodsky.
{117375}{117451}If the polls are right,|we have nothing to lose.
{117670}{117726}Hello, heap of dirt.
{117793}{117896}You don't wash much, do you,|judging by the horrible smell.
{117909}{117968}Why do you say that?|I had a shower this morning.
{117974}{118037}He had a shower this morning.
{118049}{118099}You trying to call me a liar?
{118105}{118125}No, brother.
{118134}{118208}You must think I'm awfully stupid.
{118344}{118387}Why did you do that, brother?
{118393}{118440}I've never done wrong to you.
{118446}{118496}You want to know why I did that?
{118506}{118531}Well, you see...
{118537}{118567}...I do this...
{118573}{118602}...and that...
{118608}{118685}...and this because I don't like|your horrible type, do I?
{118691}{118747}And if you want|to start something...
{118753}{118813}...you just go ahead.|Go on!
{118819}{118848}Please do!
{118887}{118931}I'm going to be sick.
{118951}{118991}You're going to be sick, are you?
{118997}{119054}I'm going to be sick.|Please let me get up.
{119072}{119110}You want to get up?
{119120}{119161}Well, now you listen to me.
{119178}{119216}If you want to get up...
{119228}{119275}...you've got to|do something for me.
{119292}{119320}Here.
{119332}{119359}Here.
{119376}{119416}You see that?
{119440}{119475}You see that shoe?
{119507}{119542}I want you to lick it.
{119548}{119579}Go on!
{119604}{119640}Lick it!
{119714}{119770}And, O my brothers,|would you believe...
{119776}{119855}...your faithful friend|and long-suffering narrator...
{119861}{119919}...pushed out his red yabzick|a mile and a half...
{119925}{119993}...to lick the grahzny,|vonny boots.
{120012}{120036}And again!
{120042}{120101}The horrible killing sickness|had whooshed up...
{120107}{120146}...and turned the joy of battle...
{120165}{120228}...into a feeling|I was going to snuff it.
{120234}{120265}And again.
{120277}{120325}Nice and clean.
{120388}{120416}Thank you very much.
{120422}{120466}That will do very well.
{120567}{120622}Thank you very much,|ladies and gentlemen.
{122311}{122352}She came towards me...
{122358}{122448}... with the light, like it was the|light light of heavenly grace.
{122454}{122507}And the thing that flashed|in me gulliver...
{122513}{122576}... was that I'd like to have her|there on the floor...
{122582}{122659}... with the old in-out,|real savage.
{123045}{123102}But quick as a shot|came the sickness.
{123108}{123169}Like a detective who'd been|watching around the corner...
{123188}{123254}...and now followed|to make his arrest.
{123568}{123589}Enough!
{123597}{123636}Thank you very much.
{123642}{123684}Thank you, my dear.
{124208}{124272}Not feeling too bad now, are you?
{124282}{124336}No, sir.|I feel really great, sir.
{124342}{124388}-Good.|-Was it all right, sir?
{124394}{124414}Did I do well?
{124420}{124500}Fine, my boy.|Absolutely fine.
{124506}{124536}You see, ladies and gentlemen...
{124542}{124601}...our subject is impelled|towards the good...
{124607}{124695}...by paradoxically|being impelled towards evil.
{124701}{124742}The intention to act violently...
{124748}{124829}...is accompanied by strong|feelings of physical distress.
{124835}{124900}To counter these,|the subject has to switch...
{124906}{124977}...to a diametrically|opposed attitude.
{124993}{125026}Any questions?
{125032}{125066}Choice!
{125149}{125233}The boy has no real choice, has he?
{125239}{125276}Self-interest.
{125282}{125327}The fear of physical pain...
{125333}{125442}...drove him to that|grotesque act of self-abasement.
{125459}{125509}Its insincerity|was clearly to be seen.
{125515}{125560}He ceases to be a wrongdoer.
{125566}{125676}He ceases also to be|a creature capable of moral choice.
{125682}{125738}Padre, these are subtleties.
{125744}{125819}We're not concerned with motives,|with the higher ethics.
{125825}{125913}We are concerned only|with cutting down crime.
{125969}{126079}And with relieving the ghastly|congestion in our prisons.
{126093}{126152}He will be your true Christian...
{126158}{126208}...ready to turn the other cheek.
{126214}{126286}Ready to be crucified,|rather than crucify.
{126292}{126391}Sick to the very heart at the|thought even of killing a fly.
{126397}{126429}Reclamation.
{126435}{126489}Joy before the angels of God.
{126495}{126570}The point is that it works!
{126675}{126755}And the very next day,|your friend and humble narrator...
{126761}{126810}... was a free man.
{127731}{127765}Son!
{127803}{127858}Hi, hi, hi there, my Pee and Em.
{127890}{127920}Mum.
{127964}{128020}How are you, love?|Nice to see you.
{128060}{128116}-Dad.|-Lad. What a surprise.
{128122}{128172}-Good to see you.|-Keeping fit?
{128190}{128220}How are you, then?
{128226}{128277}I'm fine, fine.
{128283}{128330}Keeping out of trouble, you know.
{128396}{128437}I'm back!
{128503}{128527}Good to see you.
{128533}{128608}Why didn't you let us know|what was happening?
{128617}{128692}I wanted it to be, like,|a big surprise for you and Pee.
{128699}{128768}It's a surprise, all right.|A bit bewildering too.
{128774}{128842}We've only just read about it|in morning papers.
{128848}{128891}You should have let us know, lad.
{128907}{129001}Not that we're not very pleased|to see you again, and all...
{129007}{129043}...cured too, eh?
{129049}{129099}That's right.|They did a great job on me.
{129105}{129168}I'm completely reformed.
{129257}{129298}Still the same old place, then?
{129598}{129666}There's a strange fellow|sitting on the sofa...
{129672}{129747}...munchy-wunching|lomticks of toast.
{129819}{129861}That's Joe.
{129907}{129954}He lives here now.
{129961}{129993}The lodger.
{129999}{130037}That's what he is.
{130047}{130095}He rents your room.
{130351}{130386}How do you do, Joe?
{130392}{130441}Find the room comfortable, do you?
{130447}{130494}No complaints?
{130568}{130612}I've heard about you.
{130638}{130680}I know what you've done.
{130784}{130872}Breaking the hearts of your|poor, grieving parents.
{130896}{130938}So you're back, eh?
{130944}{131055}Back to make life a misery for|your lovely parents once more?
{131062}{131098}Over my dead corpse, you will.
{131104}{131183}Because, you see, they've let me|be more like a son to them...
{131189}{131236}...than like a lodger.
{131275}{131336}Don't go fighting here, boys.
{131477}{131521}Do put your hand|over your mouth, please.
{131528}{131557}It's bloody revolting.
{131690}{131728}Are you all right?
{131756}{131796}It's the treatment.
{131802}{131865}It's disgusting.|Enough to put you off your food.
{131871}{131962}Leave him be, Joe.|It's the treatment.
{132012}{132079}Do you think we ought|to do something?
{132105}{132185}Would you like me to make you|a nice cup of tea, son?
{132443}{132517}What have you done|with all me own personal things?
{132620}{132686}That was all...
{132692}{132732}...took away, son.
{132746}{132789}By the police.
{132799}{132845}New regulation, see...
{132851}{132924}...about compensation|for the victims.
{132989}{133028}What about Basil?
{133100}{133142}Where is my snake?
{133388}{133417}He met with...
{133423}{133466}...like, an accident.
{133561}{133596}He passed away.
{133724}{133775}What's going to happen to me, then?
{133829}{133858}I mean...
{133885}{133920}...that's my room he's in.
{133926}{133971}There's no denying that.
{133996}{134058}This is my home also.
{134104}{134187}What suggestions have you,|my Pee and Em, to make?
{134329}{134391}All this needs thinking about, son.
{134421}{134489}We can't very well|just kick Joe out.
{134495}{134539}Not just like that, can we?
{134545}{134570}I mean...
{134576}{134623}...Joe's here doing a job.
{134629}{134684}A contract it is.|Two years.
{134690}{134779}We made, like, an arrangement.|Didn't we, Joe?
{134821}{134868}You see, son...
{134900}{134985}...Joe's paid next month's|rent already...
{135022}{135090}...so whatever we may do in|the future, we can't just say...
{135096}{135168}...to Joe to get out, now can we?
{135178}{135223}No, but it's much more than that.
{135244}{135302}I mean, I've got you two|to think of...
{135308}{135377}...who've been like|a father and mother to me.
{135383}{135454}It wouldn't be right for me|to go off and leave you two...
{135460}{135530}...to the tender mercies|of this young monster...
{135536}{135614}...who's been like|no real son at all.
{135629}{135685}Look, he's weeping now.
{135691}{135762}But that's all his craft|and artfulness.
{135770}{135836}Let him go and find|a room somewhere else.
{135842}{135945}Let him learn the errors|of his way, and that a bad boy...
{135951}{136034}...doesn't deserve such a good|mum and dad as he's had.
{136171}{136202}All right.
{136228}{136273}I know how things are now.
{136308}{136371}I've suffered and I've suffered...
{136377}{136424}...and I've suffered.
{136441}{136518}And everybody wants me|to go on suffering.
{136565}{136617}You've made others suffer.
{136629}{136704}It's only right|that you should suffer proper.
{136727}{136767}I've been told|everything you've done...
{136773}{136820}...sitting around the family table.
{136826}{136900}And pretty shocking|it was to listen to.
{136922}{136998}It made me real sick,|a lot of it did.
{137045}{137131}Now look what you've gone|and done to your mother.
{137137}{137176}Come on. It's all right now.
{137486}{137514}Right!
{137532}{137573}I'm leaving now.
{137579}{137630}You won't ever viddy me no more.
{137636}{137677}I'll make me own way.
{137688}{137776}Thank you very much. Let it lie|heavy on your consciences.
{137808}{137879}Now don't take it like that, son.
{139372}{139443}Can you spare some cutter,|me brother?
{139486}{139561}Can you spare some cutter,|me brother?
{139649}{139723}Can you spare some cutter,|me brother?
{140234}{140269}Thanks, brother.
{140699}{140743}Jamey Mack!
{140754}{140789}May the hokey fly!
{140797}{140882}Mother of God and all the blessed|saints in heaven preserve us!
{140923}{140973}I never forget a face, me God!
{140979}{141011}I never forget any face.
{141017}{141084}Leave me alone, brother.|I've never seen you before!
{141090}{141173}This is the poisonous young swine|that near done me in.
{141179}{141207}Him and his friends.
{141213}{141282}They beat me and kicked me|and punched me.
{141288}{141325}Stop him! Stop him!
{141331}{141425}They laughed at me blood|and me moans, this murderous dog!
{141431}{141512}Then there was like|a sea of dirty, smelly old men...
{141518}{141568}...trying to get at|your humble narrator...
{141574}{141662}... with their feeble rookers|and horny old claws.
{141668}{141735}It was old age|having a go at youth.
{141752}{141830}And I daren't do a single|solitary thing, O my brothers.
{141837}{141885}It being better|to be hit at like that...
{141891}{141953}...than want to sick|and feel that horrible pain.
{141959}{141993}All right, all right!
{141999}{142020}Stop it now!
{142026}{142107}Come on. Stop breaking the|state's peace, you naughty boys!
{142113}{142181}Back away! Go away with you!
{142187}{142242}What's your trouble, sir?
{142425}{142458}Well!
{142474}{142533}Well, well, well!
{142627}{142687}If it isn't little Alex.
{142693}{142726}Long time no viddy, droog.
{142732}{142767}How goes?
{142773}{142803}It's impossible.
{142809}{142838}I don't believe it.
{142844}{142889}Evidence of the old glazzies.
{142895}{142938}Nothing up our sleeves.
{142944}{142993}No magic, little Alex.
{142999}{143082}A job for two|who are now of job age.
{143091}{143125}The police.
{143502}{143531}Come on, Alex.
{143537}{143574}Come for walking.
{143852}{143910}Come, come, come,|my little droogies.
{143916}{143953}I just don't get this at all.
{143959}{144011}The old days are dead and gone.
{144017}{144085}For what I did in the past,|I've been punished.
{144092}{144132}I've been cured.
{144138}{144167}That was read out to us.
{144173}{144217}The inspector read it|all out to us.
{144223}{144287}He said it was a very good way.
{144293}{144323}But what is all this?
{144330}{144390}It was them|that went for me, brothers.
{144396}{144460}You're not on their side,|and can't be.
{144474}{144526}You can't be, Dim.
{144532}{144596}It was someone we fillied with|back in the old days...
{144602}{144685}...trying to get his own revenge|after all this time. Remember?
{144691}{144725}A long time is right.
{144731}{144785}I don't remember them days|too horrorshow.
{144791}{144841}And don't call me Dim|no more, either.
{144847}{144897}Officer, call me.
{144905}{144988}Enough is remembered, though,|little Alex.
{145003}{145077}And this is to make sure|you stay cured.
{146418}{146445}That's enough.
{146451}{146514}A bit more. He's still kicking.
{146966}{147010}Cured, are you?
{147050}{147142}Be viddying you some more|sometime, droogie.
{147508}{147604}Where was I to go,|who had no home and no money?
{147610}{147663}I cried for meself.
{147671}{147738}Home, home, home.
{147744}{147789}It was home I was wanting.
{147795}{147867}And it was home|I came to, brothers...
{147873}{147936}...not realizing,|in the state I was in...
{147942}{148014}... where I was|and had been before.
{149170}{149218}Who on earth could that be?
{149591}{149631}I'll see who it is.
{149908}{149946}Yes, what is it?
{150154}{150183}Please...
{150587}{150667}Frank, I think this young man|needs some help.
{150780}{150814}My God!
{150837}{150891}What's happened to you, my boy?
{150950}{151038}And would you believe it,|O my brothers and only friends...
{151044}{151098}...there was your|faithful narrator...
{151104}{151163}...being held helpless|like a babe in arms...
{151169}{151226}...and suddenly realizing|where he was...
{151232}{151314}...and why "home" on the gate|had looked so familiar.
{151320}{151362}But I knew I was safe.
{151368}{151417}I knew he would not remember me.
{151423}{151465}For in those carefree days...
{151471}{151516}...I and my so-called droogs...
{151522}{151606}... wore our maskies, which were|like real horrorshow disguises.
{151637}{151666}Police.
{151754}{151806}Ghastly, horrible police...
{151854}{151892}...they beat me up, sir.
{151995}{152052}The police beat me up.
{152102}{152142}I know you!
{152243}{152294}Isn't it your picture|in the newspapers?
{152300}{152353}Didn't I see you|on the video this morning?
{152359}{152439}Are you not the poor victim|of this horrible new technique?
{152446}{152476}Yes, sir.
{152487}{152564}That's exactly who I am and|what I am, sir. A victim.
{152570}{152645}Then, by God, you've been|sent here by providence!
{152651}{152725}Tortured in prison, then|tortured by the police.
{152731}{152839}My heart goes out to you.|You're not the first to come here.
{152845}{152914}The police like to bring|their victims to this village.
{152920}{152953}But it's providential that you...
{152959}{153044}...who are also another kind|of victim, should come here.
{153091}{153164}But you're cold and shivering.
{153176}{153209}Julian...
{153215}{153269}...draw a bath for this young man.
{153275}{153307}Certainly, Frank.
{153316}{153355}Thank you very much.
{153361}{153400}God bless you.
{154717}{154772}He can be the most potent|weapon imaginable...
{154778}{154854}...to ensure the government|is not returned in the election.
{154860}{154903}The government's big boast, sir...
{154909}{154974}...is the way they have|dealt with crime:
{154980}{155024}Recruiting young roughs|into the police...
{155030}{155103}...proposing will-sapping|techniques of conditioning.
{155109}{155163}We've seen it before|in other countries.
{155169}{155204}The thin end of the wedge.
{155210}{155308}Before we know it, we'll have the|full apparatus of totalitarianism.
{155405}{155510}This young boy is a living witness|to these diabolical proposals.
{155516}{155606}The people, the common people,|must know, must see.
{155612}{155717}There are traditions of liberty to|defend. That tradition is all.
{155723}{155770}The common people|will let it go, yes.
{155776}{155827}They'll sell liberty|for a quieter life.
{155833}{155870}That is why they must be led.
{155876}{155926}Driven. Pushed.
{156047}{156077}Fine.
{156102}{156142}Thank you very much, sir.
{156191}{156228}He'll be here.
{156305}{156384}I'm singing in the rain
{156403}{156474}Just singing in the rain
{156494}{156570}What a glorious feeling
{156579}{156659}I'm hap-hap-happy again
{156674}{156749}I'm laughing at clouds
{156768}{156829}So dark up above
{156853}{156912}The sun's in my heart
{156932}{157027}I'm ready for love
{157049}{157115}Let the stormy clouds chase
{157130}{157198}Everyone from the place
{157233}{157353}Come on with the rain|I've a smile on my face
{157368}{157440}I'll walk down the lane
{158260}{158295}Good evening, sir.
{158390}{158427}Good evening.
{158440}{158508}It was very kind of you|to leave this out for me.
{158514}{158572}There was no one around,|so I started.
{158578}{158622}Hope that's all right, sir.
{158706}{158747}Of course.
{159487}{159544}Food all right?
{159681}{159722}Great, sir. Great.
{159793}{159847}Try the wine.
{160000}{160031}Thank you, sir.
{160095}{160125}Cheers.
{160174}{160203}Happy days.
{160455}{160510}Won't you join me?
{160528}{160581}My health doesn't allow it.
{160601}{160633}No, thank you.
{160776}{160835}" 1960, Chteau...
{160848}{160894}...Saint-Estphe.
{160900}{160920}Mdoc."
{160926}{160949}Very good brand.
{161158}{161182}Very good...
{161188}{161218}...color, sir.
{161319}{161360}Smells nice too.
{161718}{161767}Very nice little number.
{161796}{161828}Here's to it.
{162037}{162098}Very refreshing, sir.|Very refreshing.
{162104}{162174}I'm pleased you|appreciate good wine.
{162201}{162246}Have another glass.
{162561}{162594}My wife...
{162629}{162713}...used to do everything for me|and leave me to my writing.
{162783}{162823}Your wife? Is she away?
{162832}{162888}She's dead!
{162987}{163031}I'm sorry to hear about that.
{163037}{163094}She was very badly raped, you see.
{163100}{163158}We were assaulted by|vicious young hoodlums...
{163164}{163220}...in this very room|you're sitting in now.
{163226}{163340}I was left a helpless cripple,|but for her the agony was too great.
{163348}{163392}The doctors said|it was pneumonia...
{163398}{163466}...because it happened later,|during a flu epidemic.
{163472}{163574}The doctors told me it was|pneumonia, but I knew what it was.
{163580}{163684}A victim of the modern age.|Poor, poor girl!
{163780}{163818}And now you.
{163832}{163905}Another victim of the modern age.
{163912}{163959}But you can be helped.
{163983}{164066}I phoned some friends while|you were having your bath.
{164072}{164092}Some...
{164098}{164124}...friends?
{164130}{164167}They want to help you.
{164173}{164227}-Help me?|-Help you.
{164233}{164317}-Who are they?|-Very, very important people.
{164323}{164380}And they're interested in you.
{164511}{164563}This'll be these people now.
{164569}{164651}I don't want to trouble you|any further. I should be leaving.
{164677}{164724}No trouble at all.
{164741}{164770}Here.
{164776}{164822}Let me fill your glass.
{165438}{165480}So this is the young man.
{165513}{165548}How do you do, sir?
{165557}{165620}Missus.|I'm very pleased to meet you.
{165629}{165689}I hope you forgive us for coming|at this hour...
{165695}{165740}...but we heard you|were in trouble...
{165746}{165800}...and so we came over to see|if we could help.
{165806}{165860}Very kind of you, sir.|Thank you very much.
{165866}{165920}I understand you had a rather...
{165926}{165956}...unfortunate...
{165962}{165998}...encounter...
{166004}{166046}...with the police tonight.
{166052}{166102}Yes, I suppose|you could call it that.
{166108}{166140}How are you feeling now?
{166146}{166176}Much better, thank you.
{166182}{166239}Feel like talking,|answering a few questions?
{166245}{166277}Fine, sir. Fine.
{166297}{166361}As I said, we've heard about you.
{166373}{166436}We are interested in your case.
{166442}{166511}-We want to help you.|-Thank you very much.
{166518}{166593}Shall we get down to it?
{166599}{166642}Fine. Fine, sir.
{166769}{166835}The newspapers mentioned...
{166841}{166944}...in addition to being conditioned|against acts of sex and violence...
{166950}{167031}...you've inadvertently been|conditioned against music.
{167054}{167128}I think that was something|that they didn't plan for.
{167136}{167182}You see, missus...
{167188}{167272}...l'm very fond of music.|Especially Beethoven.
{167299}{167346}Ludwig van Beethoven.
{167352}{167407}-B-E...|-lt's all right, thank you.
{167420}{167518}And it just so happened that|while they were showing me...
{167524}{167618}...a particularly bad film|of, like, a concentration camp...
{167624}{167709}...the background music|was playing Beethoven.
{167715}{167781}So now you have|the same reaction to music...
{167787}{167829}...as you do to sex and violence?
{167835}{167938}No, missus. You see, it's not|all music. It's just the Ninth.
{167944}{167986}You mean Beethoven's Ninth Symphony?
{167992}{168065}That's right. I can't listen|to the Ninth anymore at all.
{168071}{168154}When I hear the Ninth, I get, like...
{168160}{168199}...this funny feeling.
{168224}{168327}And then all I can think about|is, like, trying to snuff it.
{168333}{168439}-I beg your pardon?|-Snuff it. Death, I mean.
{168445}{168507}I just want to die peacefully...
{168518}{168574}...like, with no pain.
{168592}{168637}Do you feel that way now?
{168665}{168712}No, sir, not exactly.
{168718}{168748}I still feel...
{168754}{168784}...very miserable.
{168790}{168851}Very much down in spirits.
{168863}{168895}Do you still feel...
{168901}{168937}...suicidal?
{169015}{169057}Put it this way:
{169064}{169132}I feel very low in myself.
{169152}{169208}I can't see much in the future.
{169214}{169321}I feel that any second, something|terrible is going to happen to me.
{169638}{169678}Well done, Frank.
{169823}{169866}Get the car, would you, please?
{170360}{170393}I woke up...
{170526}{170616}...the pain and sickness|all over me like an animal.
{170809}{170877}Then I realized what it was.
{170908}{170975}The music coming up|from the floor...
{170981}{171057}... was our old friend,|Ludwig van...
{171063}{171127}...and the dreaded Ninth Symphony.
{171317}{171350}Let me out!
{171356}{171398}Open the door!
{171415}{171467}Come on, open the door!
{171528}{171559}Turn it off!
{171565}{171607}Turn it off!
{171773}{171795}Stop it!
{172952}{172989}Turn it off!
{173023}{173046}Please!
{173052}{173104}Turn it off!
{173438}{173507}Suddenly, I viddied|what I had to do...
{173513}{173569}...and what I had wanted to do.
{173579}{173637}And that was to do myself in.
{173647}{173680}To snuff it.
{173688}{173769}To blast off forever,|out of this wicked, cruel world.
{173807}{173865}One moment of pain, perhaps...
{173872}{173915}...and then sleep.
{173921}{173981}Forever and ever...
{173987}{174019}...and ever.
{174605}{174648}I jumped, O my brothers...
{174654}{174689}...and I fell hard.
{174695}{174750}But I did not snuff it.
{174765}{174803}If I had snuffed it...
{174809}{174888}...I would not be here|to tell what I told have.
{174934}{175045}I came back to life|after a long, black, black gap...
{175051}{175130}...of what might have been|a million years.
{175819}{175880}He's recovered|consciousness, Doctor.
{176841}{176877}Hello, lad.
{176883}{176921}Hello, son.
{176944}{176979}How are you?
{177006}{177054}You feeling better?
{177161}{177186}What...
{177192}{177217}...gives...
{177252}{177300}...O my Pee and Em?
{177324}{177361}What makes...
{177380}{177402}...you think...
{177408}{177467}...you are welcome?
{177537}{177584}There, there, Mother.|It's all right.
{177590}{177629}He doesn't mean it.
{177688}{177749}You were in the papers again, son.
{177768}{177805}It said...
{177811}{177877}...they had done|great wrong to you.
{177898}{177930}It said...
{177936}{177968}...how the government...
{177974}{178022}...drove you to try...
{178028}{178066}...and do yourself in.
{178109}{178164}And when you think about it, son...
{178190}{178253}...maybe it was our fault too...
{178262}{178292}...in a way.
{178319}{178365}Your home's your home...
{178373}{178433}...when all's said and done, son.
{178673}{178733}-Good morning.|-Good morning, Doctor.
{178948}{179002}-How are you feeling today?|-Fine.
{179008}{179035}Good. May I?
{179045}{179094}-I'm Dr. Taylor.|-Haven't seen you before.
{179100}{179131}I'm your psychiatrist.
{179137}{179182}Psychiatrist!|Do I need one?
{179188}{179224}Just part of hospital routine.
{179229}{179281}Are we going to|talk about me sex life?
{179322}{179370}I'm going to show you|some slides...
{179376}{179444}...and you're going to tell me|what you think about them.
{179466}{179487}Jolly good.
{179538}{179576}You know anything about dreams?
{179586}{179613}Something, yes.
{179619}{179661}-You know what they mean?|-Perhaps.
{179666}{179701}You concerned about something?
{179707}{179779}No, not concerned, really...
{179785}{179833}...but I've been having|this nasty dream.
{179839}{179874}Very nasty.
{179880}{179926}It's like...
{179974}{180026}...when I was all smashed up,|you know...
{180032}{180081}...and half-awake|and unconscious-like...
{180087}{180138}...I kept having this dream.
{180144}{180213}All these doctors were|playing around with me gulliver.
{180219}{180269}You know, like the inside|of me brain.
{180275}{180344}I seem to have this dream|over and over again.
{180350}{180401}Do you think it means anything?
{180423}{180529}Patients with injuries like yours|often have dreams of this sort.
{180535}{180585}It's all part|of the recovery process.
{180615}{180682}Now then, each of these slides|needs a reply...
{180688}{180736}...from one of the people|in the picture.
{180742}{180819}You tell me what you think|the person would say...
{180825}{180846}...all right?
{180852}{180886}Righty-right.
{180934}{180991}"Isn't the plumage beautiful?"
{181021}{181080}I just say what the|other person would say?
{181180}{181217}Don't think about it too long.
{181223}{181283}Say the first thing|that pops into your mind.
{181347}{181404}Cabbages. Knickers.
{181432}{181487}It's not got a beak.
{181493}{181524}Good.
{181612}{181706}"The boy you always quarreled with|is seriously ill."
{181729}{181771}My mind is a blank...
{181796}{181890}...and I'll smash your face|for you, yarblockos.
{181896}{181920}Good.
{181982}{182032}"What do you want?"
{182059}{182140}No time for the old in-out, love.|I've just come to read the meter.
{182149}{182182}Good.
{182265}{182349}"You sold me a crummy watch.|I want my money back."
{182361}{182438}You know what you can do with|that watch? Stick it up your ass!
{182543}{182608}"You can do whatever|you like with these."
{182646}{182688}Eggiwegs.
{182701}{182748}I would like...
{182754}{182785}...to smash them.
{182805}{182835}And pick them all up...
{182841}{182880}...and throw...
{182886}{182921}Fucking hell!
{182942}{182998}There. That's all there is to it.
{183014}{183050}Are you all right?
{183071}{183103}Hope so.
{183109}{183182}Is that the end, then?|I was quite enjoying that.
{183190}{183221}Good. I'm glad.
{183228}{183255}How many did I get right?
{183261}{183304}It's not that kind of a test.
{183310}{183390}But you seem well on the way|to making a complete recovery.
{183405}{183439}When do I get out, then?
{183445}{183507}I'm sure it won't be long now.
{183541}{183579}So I waited...
{183585}{183621}...and, O my brothers...
{183630}{183664}...I got a lot better...
{183670}{183748}...munching away at eggiwegs|and lomticks of toast...
{183754}{183812}...and lovely steakie-wakes.
{183818}{183853}And then one day...
{183859}{183959}...they said I was going to have|a very special visitor.
{184089}{184154}Just wait outside for a moment,|would you, Officer?
{184228}{184280}I'm afraid my change of schedule|has thrown you.
{184286}{184340}The patient's in the middle|of supper.
{184346}{184414}That's quite all right, Minister.|No trouble at all.
{184449}{184521}-Good evening, my boy.|-Hi there, my little droogies.
{184527}{184570}How are you getting on, young man?
{184579}{184632}Great, sir. Just great.
{184651}{184688}Can I do anything more for you?
{184694}{184736}I don't think so, Sir Leslie.
{184742}{184806}Then I leave you to it.|Nurse!
{184874}{184952}You seem to have a whole ward|to yourself, my boy.
{184958}{184989}Yes, sir.
{185002}{185058}And a very lonely place|it is too...
{185064}{185121}...when I wake up in the night|with me pain.
{185156}{185210}Anyway, good to see you|on the mend.
{185216}{185278}I kept in touch|with the hospital, of course.
{185284}{185328}And now I've come down|personally...
{185334}{185372}...to see how you're getting along.
{185383}{185437}I've suffered the tortures|of the damned.
{185443}{185479}Tortures of the damned.
{185485}{185559}Yes, I can appreciate that|you've had an extremely...
{185565}{185630}Oh, look. Let me help you|with that, shall I?
{185683}{185785}I can tell you that l, and the|government of which I'm a member...
{185791}{185885}...are deeply sorry about this,|my boy. Deeply sorry.
{185891}{185921}We tried to help you.
{185927}{186025}We followed recommendations|that turned out to be wrong.
{186034}{186127}An inquiry will place the|responsibility where it belongs.
{186143}{186220}We want you to regard us|as friends.
{186226}{186255}We put you right.
{186266}{186311}You're getting|the best of treatment.
{186317}{186371}We never wished you harm.
{186378}{186442}But there are some who did, and do.
{186454}{186518}And I think you know who those are.
{186532}{186623}There are certain people who wanted|to use you for political ends.
{186629}{186685}They would have been|glad to have you dead...
{186691}{186767}...for they thought they could then|blame it on the government.
{186781}{186837}There is also a certain man...
{186843}{186903}...a writer of subversive|literature...
{186909}{186959}...who has been howling|for your blood.
{186965}{187047}He's been mad with desire|to stick a knife into you.
{187057}{187094}But you're safe from him now.
{187100}{187149}We put him away.
{187195}{187269}He found out that you|had done wrong to him.
{187282}{187341}At least he believed|you had done wrong.
{187347}{187448}He formed this idea in his head|that you had been responsible...
{187454}{187536}...for the death of someone|near and dear to him.
{187557}{187583}He was a menace.
{187589}{187640}We put him away|for his own protection.
{187645}{187677}And also for yours.
{187696}{187729}Where is he now?
{187735}{187818}We put him away|where he can do you no harm.
{187824}{187898}You see, we are looking|after your interests.
{187904}{187954}We are interested in you.
{187971}{188044}When you leave, you'll have no|worries. We'll see to everything.
{188050}{188101}A good job on a good salary.
{188107}{188148}What job and how much?
{188169}{188264}You'll have an interesting job at|a salary you regard as adequate.
{188270}{188323}Not only for the job|you're going to do...
{188329}{188416}...and in compensation for what|you believe you have suffered...
{188422}{188509}...but also because|you are helping us.
{188540}{188577}Helping you?
{188583}{188658}We always help our friends,|don't we?
{188815}{188868}It is no secret|that this government...
{188874}{188950}...has lost a lot of popularity|because of you, my boy.
{188956}{189037}There are some who think that at|the next election we shall be out.
{189043}{189108}The press has chosen to take|a very unfavorable view...
{189114}{189148}...of what we tried to do.
{189171}{189250}But public opinion|has a way of changing.
{189256}{189297}And you, Alex...
{189303}{189347}...if I may call you Alex...
{189353}{189432}Certainly.|What do they call you at home?
{189464}{189495}My name is Frederick.
{189518}{189562}As I was saying, Alex...
{189568}{189685}...you can be instrumental|in changing the public's verdict.
{189765}{189813}Do you understand, Alex?
{189835}{189888}Do I make myself clear?
{189959}{190014}As an unmuddied lake, Fred.
{190027}{190108}As clear as an azure sky|of deepest summer.
{190114}{190148}You can rely on me, Fred.
{190154}{190186}Good.
{190192}{190227}Good boy.
{190252}{190296}I understand you're fond of music.
{190302}{190355}I have arranged a little|surprise for you.
{190362}{190396}Surprise?
{190402}{190443}One that I hope|that you will like...
{190449}{190482}...as a...
{190502}{190535}...how shall we put it...
{190541}{190618}...as a symbol of|our new understanding.
{190642}{190721}An understanding|between two friends.
{192640}{192703}I was cured, all right!
