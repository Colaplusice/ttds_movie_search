Harold's father had
a similar sense of the absurd.

I remember once, in Paris, he had
just stepped out for cigarettes.

he was arrested by the police

down the Seine,

00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:59,089
have you performed?

181
00:13:59,173 --> 00:14:02,050
An accurate number
would be difficult to gauge.

182
00:14:02,092 --> 00:14:05,053
Well, just give me
a rough estimate.

183
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,638
A rough estimate?

184
00:14:08,098 --> 00:14:09,558
I'd say...

185
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:11,894
1 5.

186
00:14:11,977 --> 00:14:13,145
1 5?

187
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:14,897
That's a rough estimate.

188
00:14:14,980 --> 00:14:17,733
Were they all done
for your mother's benefit?

189
00:14:17,816 --> 00:14:19,943
No. No.

190
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:22,321
I would not say benefit.

191
00:14:22,613 --> 00:14:24,823
I only have a few minutes,

192
00:14:24,907 --> 00:14:28,076
and I want to inform you
of my decision.

193
00:14:30,037 --> 00:14:32,456
You have led
a very carefree,

194
00:14:32,498 --> 00:14:34,958
idle, happy life
up to the present,

195
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,919
the life of a child.

196
00:14:37,002 --> 00:14:39,922
But it is time now
to put away childish things

197
00:14:40,005 --> 00:14:41,924
and take on
adult responsibilities.

198
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:44,468
Oh, we'd all like
to sail through life

199
00:14:44,551 --> 00:14:47,471
with no thought of tomorrow,
but that cannot be.

200
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:49,515
We have our duties,

201
00:14:49,598 --> 00:14:50,933
our obligations,

202
00:14:50,974 --> 00:14:52,434
our principles.

203
00:14:52,518 --> 00:14:53,936
In short, Harold,

204
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:57,439
I think it is time
for you to get married.

205
00:15:10,869 --> 00:15:13,789
Let us pray to the Lord,
King of glory,

206
00:15:13,872 --> 00:15:15,791
that He may
bless and deliver

207
00:15:15,874 --> 00:15:18,293
the souls of all
the faithful departed

208
00:15:18,335 --> 00:15:21,296
from the pain of hell
and the bottomless pit.

209
00:15:21,338 --> 00:15:23,298
Deliver them
from the lion's mouth

210
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:24,800
and the darkness therein,

211
00:15:24,842 --> 00:15:29,805
but rather, bring them
to the blessing of light,

212
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:32,474
holy life,
and eternal rest.

213
00:15:35,811 --> 00:15:37,187
"O Lord,

214
00:15:37,271 --> 00:15:39,648
"do not bring
your servant to trial,

215
00:15:39,731 --> 00:15:41,233
"for no man--

216
00:15:41,316 --> 00:15:42,568
Ssst!

217
00:15:43,652 --> 00:15:45,362
"becomes holy
in Your sight

218
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:48,782
"unless You grant him forgiveness
of all his sins.

219
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:50,576
"We implore You, therefore,

220
00:15:50,659 --> 00:15:53,120
"do not let the verdict
of Your judgment

221
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,538
"go against him
whom the loyal prayer

222
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,081
"of Christian faith
commends to mercy.

223
00:15:56,165 --> 00:15:57,124
Ssst!

224
00:15:57,207 --> 00:16:00,085
"Rather, by the help
of Your grace,

225
00:16:00,169 --> 00:16:03,088
"may he escape the sentence
which he deserves,

226
00:16:03,172 --> 00:16:04,882
"for during
his earthly life,

227
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:08,886
"he was signed with the seal
of the holy trinity.

228
00:16:08,969 --> 00:16:12,556
You who live and reign
forever and ever."

229
00:16:13,765 --> 00:16:14,933
Amen.

230
00:16:16,018 --> 00:16:17,019
Ssst!

231
00:16:18,645 --> 00:16:20,105
Like some licorice?

232
00:16:20,147 --> 00:16:22,649
- No, thank you.
- You're welcome.

233
00:16:29,698 --> 00:16:31,533
Did you know him?

234
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:32,868
No.

235
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,871
Me neither. I heard
he's 80 years old.

236
00:16:35,954 --> 00:16:37,414
I'll be 80 next week.

237
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:40,459
Good time to move on,
don't you think?

238
00:16:40,542 --> 00:16:42,252
I don't know.

239
00:16:43,712 --> 00:16:46,673
Well, I mean,
75 is too early,

240
00:16:46,715 --> 00:16:50,469
but at 85, you're
just marking time.

241
00:16:50,511 --> 00:16:53,472
You may as well go
over the horizon.

242
00:17:02,606 --> 00:17:05,108
I'll never understand this
mania for black.

243
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:07,611
Nobody sends black
flowers, do they?

244
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,613
Black flowers
are dead flowers.

245
00:17:09,696 --> 00:17:12,616
Who sends dead flowers
to a funeral?

246
00:17:12,699 --> 00:17:15,202
It's absurd.

247
00:17:33,136 --> 00:17:34,680
What is your name?

248
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:36,223
Harold. Harold Chasen.

249
00:17:36,306 --> 00:17:38,225
Oh, how do you do?

250
00:17:38,308 --> 00:17:41,228
I'm Dame Marjorie Chardin,
but call me Maude.

251
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,729
Nice to meet you.

252
00:17:42,813 --> 00:17:46,608
Thanks. I think we're going
to be great friends, don't you?

253
00:17:46,650 --> 00:17:48,443
Can I give you a lift?

254
00:17:48,527 --> 00:17:51,154
No, thank you.
I have my own car.

255
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,656
Well, I must be off.

256
00:17:52,698 --> 00:17:55,158
We shall
have to meet again.

257
00:17:57,077 --> 00:17:58,245
Ah.

258
00:18:00,747 --> 00:18:02,416
Tell me, do you dance?

259
00:18:02,499 --> 00:18:03,792
Pardon me?

260
00:18:03,876 --> 00:18:05,794
Do you sing and dance?

261
00:18:05,878 --> 00:18:07,087
Uh, no.

262
00:18:07,171 --> 00:18:09,631
Uh, no. I thought not.

263
00:18:23,645 --> 00:18:26,481
That woman.
She took my car.

264
00:18:29,651 --> 00:18:31,486
I have here the forms

265
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,114
sent by the national
computer dating service.

266
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:36,658
They screen out
the fat and ugly,

267
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,661
so it's obviously a firm
of high standards.

268
00:18:39,745 --> 00:18:41,663
First, here is
the personality interview,

269
00:18:41,747 --> 00:18:44,833
which you are to
fill out and return.

270
00:18:44,917 --> 00:18:47,669
Now then, are you
ready, Harold?

271
00:18:47,753 --> 00:18:49,671
Here is the first question.

272
00:18:49,755 --> 00:18:53,300
"Are you uncomfortable
meeting new people?"

273
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:57,137
I think that's a yes,
don't you agree, Harold?

274
00:18:57,221 --> 00:19:00,307
"Should sex education be
taught outside the home?"

275
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:03,268
Oh, I would say no,
wouldn't you, Harold?

276
00:19:03,310 --> 00:19:05,229
We'll give a "D" there.

277
00:19:05,312 --> 00:19:09,358
3--"Should women run for president
of the United States?"

278
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:12,027
I don't see why not.
Absolutely yes.

279
00:19:12,110 --> 00:19:13,862
"Do you
remember jokes

280
00:19:13,946 --> 00:19:16,907
and take pleasure
in relating them to others?"

281
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,952
You don't do that,
do you, Harold? No.

282
00:19:19,993 --> 00:19:22,079
Absolutely no.

283
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,581
"Do you often
get the feeling

284
00:19:24,623 --> 00:19:27,042
that perhaps life
isn't worth living?"

285
00:19:27,125 --> 00:19:29,586
What do you think,
Harold? "A"? "B"?

286
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:32,422
Oh, we'll put down "C,"
not sure. Mm-hmm.

287
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:35,425
"Is the subject of sex
being overexploited

288
00:19:35,509 --> 00:19:37,094
by our mass media?"

289
00:19:37,177 --> 00:19:40,097
That would have to
be yes, wouldn't it?

290
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:43,392
"Is it difficult for you
to accept criticism?"

291
00:19:43,475 --> 00:19:45,936
No. We'll mark "D."

292
00:19:45,978 --> 00:19:48,939
"Do you sometimes
have headaches or backaches

293
00:19:48,981 --> 00:19:50,399
after a difficult day?"

294
00:19:50,482 --> 00:19:53,026
Yes, I do, indeed.

295
00:19:53,110 --> 00:19:55,529
"Do you go
to sleep easily?"

296
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,239
I'd say so.

297
00:19:57,322 --> 00:20:00,242
"Do you believe in
capital punishment for murder?"

298
00:20:00,325 --> 00:20:01,785
Yes, I do, indeed.

299
00:20:01,827 --> 00:20:04,246
"In your opinion,
are social affairs

300
00:20:04,329 --> 00:20:06,248
usually a waste of time?"

301
00:20:06,331 --> 00:20:08,000
Heavens no.

302
00:20:09,251 --> 00:20:11,712
"Can God influence
our lives?"

303
00:20:11,753 --> 00:20:13,005
Oh, yes.

304
00:20:13,088 --> 00:20:15,340
Absolutely yes.

305
00:20:15,424 --> 00:20:17,843
"Does your personal religion
or philosophy

306
00:20:17,926 --> 00:20:20,012
include a life
after death?"

307
00:20:20,095 --> 00:20:21,555
Oh, yes, indeed.

308
00:20:21,597 --> 00:20:25,809
That's absolutely.

309
00:20:25,893 --> 00:20:28,854
"Did you enjoy life
when you were a child?"

310
00:20:28,937 --> 00:20:32,608
Oh, yes, you were
a wonderful baby, Harold.

311
00:20:32,691 --> 00:20:35,152
"Do you think
the sexual revolution

312
00:20:35,235 --> 00:20:36,612
has gone too far?"

313
00:20:36,695 --> 00:20:39,823
It certainly has.

314
00:20:39,865 --> 00:20:41,283
"Do you find

315
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:44,203
the idea of wife swapping
distasteful?"

316
00:20:44,286 --> 00:20:47,456
I even find
the question distasteful.

317
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:48,916
"Do you--

318
00:20:52,127 --> 00:20:53,879
Harold, please!

319
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:55,297
Harold, please!

320
00:20:55,339 --> 00:20:59,301
"Do you have ups and downs
without obvious reason?"

321
00:20:59,384 --> 00:21:01,720
Oh, that's you, Harold.

322
00:21:01,762 --> 00:21:03,263
Ha ha ha ha.

323
00:21:03,347 --> 00:21:06,391
# Lord, my body #

324
00:21:06,475 --> 00:21:09,770
# Has been a good friend #

325
00:21:09,853 --> 00:21:13,190
# But I won't need it #

326
00:21:13,273 --> 00:21:16,944
# When I reach the end #

327
00:21:17,027 --> 00:21:19,696
# Miles from nowhere #

328
00:21:19,780 --> 00:21:23,534
# I guess I'll take
my time #

329
00:21:23,617 --> 00:21:26,703
# Oh, yeah #

330
00:21:26,745 --> 00:21:31,291
# To reach there ##

331
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,170
Ssst!

332
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:47,474
"Dearest brothers,

333
00:21:47,558 --> 00:21:49,476
"let us faithfully
and lovingly

334
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,311

"Christ have mercy.

Lord have mercy."

340
00:22:02,823 --> 00:22:04,867
Our Father,
who art in heaven,

341
00:22:04,950 --> 00:22:06,785
hallowed be Thy name.

342
00:22:06,827 --> 00:22:09,580
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done on earth

343
00:22:09,663 --> 00:22:11,081
as it is in heaven.

344
00:22:11,165 --> 00:22:13,375
Give us this day
our daily bread,

345
00:22:13,417 --> 00:22:15,544
and forgive us
our trespasses

346
00:22:15,627 --> 00:22:18,130
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

347
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:20,674
Lead us not
into temptation,

348
00:22:20,716 --> 00:22:22,676
but deliver us from evil.

349
00:22:22,718 --> 00:22:24,094
Amen.

# For that happy day #

360
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,718
# Happy day ##

361
00:23:23,153 --> 00:23:25,447
Uh, my boy, excuse me.

362
00:23:25,531 --> 00:23:27,199
One moment, please.

363
00:23:27,282 --> 00:23:30,577
Who was that old lady
waving to you earlier?

364
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:33,580
Hello, Harold.
can I give you a lift?

365
00:23:33,664 --> 00:23:35,082
There you are, madam.

366
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,544
Were you not the lady
who drove my car off yesterday?

367
00:23:38,627 --> 00:23:41,588
With the St. Christopher medal
on the dashboard?

368
00:23:41,672 --> 00:23:42,756
Yes.

369
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,842
It was me.
Get in, Harold.

370
00:23:44,925 --> 00:23:48,095
Were you also the one
who painted the saint?

371
00:23:48,178 --> 00:23:50,597
Oh, yes. How did
you like that?

372
00:23:50,639 --> 00:23:52,099
Well, I didn't.

373
00:23:52,182 --> 00:23:53,600
Don't be
too discouraged.

374
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:57,187
For aesthetic appreciation,
always a little time.

375
00:24:05,279 --> 00:24:08,240
What a delight, Harold,
to bump into you again.

376
00:24:08,282 --> 00:24:11,243
I knew we were going
to be good friends.

377
00:24:11,326 --> 00:24:13,829
You go to funerals
often, don't you?

378
00:24:13,912 --> 00:24:14,830
Uh, yeah.

379
00:24:14,913 --> 00:24:15,998
So do I.

380
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,958
They're such fun,
aren't they?

381
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,960
It's all change,
all revolving--

382
00:24:19,960 --> 00:24:22,713
burials and birth,
one linked to the other,

383
00:24:22,796 --> 00:24:25,007
the great circle of life.

384
00:24:28,177 --> 00:24:30,637
Hey, this old thing
handles well.

385
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:32,097
Ever drive
a hearse, Harold?

386
00:24:32,181 --> 00:24:33,098
Yeah.

387
00:24:33,182 --> 00:24:36,101
Well, it's a new
experience for me.

388
00:24:38,562 --> 00:24:40,022
Good on curves.

389
00:24:40,105 --> 00:24:42,482
Shall I take you
home, Harold?

390
00:24:42,566 --> 00:24:44,943
Uh, this is my car.

391
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:46,486
Your hearse?

392
00:24:46,528 --> 00:24:47,487
Yearse.

393
00:24:47,529 --> 00:24:49,823
Ohhh!

394
00:24:54,369 --> 00:24:56,622
Then you shall
take me home.

395
00:25:10,302 --> 00:25:13,263
So just before he left
for the monastery in Tibet,

396
00:25:13,305 --> 00:25:15,432
big Sweeney
gave me his keys.

397
00:25:15,516 --> 00:25:17,935
'Course I made additions
for the new models,

398
00:25:17,976 --> 00:25:20,270
but not as many
as you might think.

399
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,272
Once you have
your basic set,

400
00:25:22,356 --> 00:25:24,942
it's then only
a question ofvariation.

401
00:25:24,983 --> 00:25:28,779
You hop in any car you want
and just drive off?

402
00:25:28,820 --> 00:25:31,240
Not any car.
I like to keep a variety.

403
00:25:31,323 --> 00:25:34,243
I'm always looking
for the new experience.

404
00:25:34,326 --> 00:25:35,244
Maybe.

405
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,623
Nevertheless, I think
you're upsetting people.

406
00:25:39,665 --> 00:25:42,000
I don't know
if that's right.

407
00:25:42,042 --> 00:25:44,253
Well, if some people
get upset

408
00:25:44,336 --> 00:25:47,089
because they feel they have
a hold on some things,

409
00:25:47,172 --> 00:25:49,424
I'm acting as
a gentle reminder--

410
00:25:49,508 --> 00:25:50,759
here today,
gone tomorrow,

411
00:25:50,843 --> 00:25:53,303
so don't get
attached to things.

412
00:25:53,345 --> 00:25:55,305
Now, with that
in mind,

413
00:25:55,347 --> 00:25:58,016
I'm not against
collecting stuff.

414
00:25:58,100 --> 00:26:01,895
I've collected quite
a lot of stuff in my time.

415
00:26:03,313 --> 00:26:07,359
Yeah. This is all memorabilia,
but it's incidental,

416
00:26:07,442 --> 00:26:10,404
not integral,
if you know what I mean.

417
00:26:10,445 --> 00:26:11,905
Oh--the birds.

418
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:12,906
Wow.

419
00:26:12,990 --> 00:26:15,242
Oh, I love them so much.

420
00:26:15,284 --> 00:26:19,079
They're the only wildlife
I get to see anymore.

421
00:26:19,121 --> 00:26:21,957
Ah, me. Free as a bird.

422
00:26:24,126 --> 00:26:28,797
At one time I broke into pet shops
to liberate the canaries,

423
00:26:28,839 --> 00:26:32,301
but I decided that was an idea
way before its time.

424
00:26:32,384 --> 00:26:36,388
Zoos are full,
prisons are overflowing...

425
00:26:36,471 --> 00:26:43,395
Ah, my. How the world
still dearly loves a cage.

426
00:26:43,478 --> 00:26:45,439
Uh, please sit down,
Harold.

427
00:26:45,439 --> 00:26:47,274
I'll put the kettle on.

428
00:26:47,357 --> 00:26:49,776
We'll have a nice
hot cup of tea.

429
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,612
Thanks, but
I have to go.

430
00:26:51,695 --> 00:26:53,447
But it's oat straw tea.

431
00:26:53,488 --> 00:26:55,616
You've never had
oat straw tea, have you?

432
00:26:55,699 --> 00:26:56,617
No.

433
00:26:56,700 --> 00:26:57,784
Well, then.

434
00:26:57,868 --> 00:27:00,579
But I have to go.
I have an appointment.

435
00:27:00,662 --> 00:27:02,581
I really can't miss it.

436
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:04,917
Oh. At the dentist?

437
00:27:06,293 --> 00:27:07,544
Kind of.

438
00:27:08,879 --> 00:27:12,341
Well, then you'll just
have to come back and visit.

439
00:27:12,424 --> 00:27:13,383
All right.

440
00:27:13,425 --> 00:27:15,594
My door's always open.

441
00:27:15,636 --> 00:27:16,720
All right.

442
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:18,972
- Promise?
- I promise.

443
00:27:22,809 --> 00:27:23,810
Harold.

444
00:27:25,979 --> 00:27:26,980
Harold?

445
00:27:28,982 --> 00:27:31,944
I asked, do you
have any friends?

446
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:32,945
No.

447
00:27:32,986 --> 00:27:35,239
None at all?

448
00:27:35,322 --> 00:27:37,115
No.

449
00:27:37,199 --> 00:27:38,325
Maybe one.

450
00:27:38,367 --> 00:27:41,245
Would you care to talk
about this friend?

451
00:27:41,328 --> 00:27:42,955
No.

452
00:27:43,038 --> 00:27:45,791
I find you a very
interesting case, Harold,

453
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:47,960
but this reluctance
on your part

454
00:27:48,001 --> 00:27:49,962
is detrimental to
the psychoanalytical process.

455
00:27:50,045 --> 00:27:52,089
Do you understand?

456
00:27:55,843 --> 00:27:56,760
Very well.

457
00:27:56,844 --> 00:27:58,762
Your mother tells me,
Harold,

458
00:27:58,846 --> 00:28:01,682
that she's arranging
several dates for you

459
00:28:01,765 --> 00:28:03,767
with some young ladies.

460
00:28:03,851 --> 00:28:06,520
How do you
feel about that?

461
00:28:12,317 --> 00:28:13,735
Hello. I'm Candy Gulf.

462
00:28:13,777 --> 00:28:16,738
How do you do?
I'm Mrs. Chasen. Do come in.

463
00:28:16,822 --> 00:28:18,574
Harold is
out in the garden.

464
00:28:18,615 --> 00:28:20,742
He'll be here
in a moment.

465
00:28:20,826 --> 00:28:22,744
Shall we sit down?

466
00:28:22,828 --> 00:28:24,913
Oh, there's Harold.

467
00:28:24,997 --> 00:28:25,914
Hello.

468
00:28:31,837 --> 00:28:33,755
Oh, he seems very nice.

469
00:28:33,839 --> 00:28:35,257
Oh, thank you.

470
00:28:36,508 --> 00:28:39,678
- You are at the university?
- Yes, I am.

471
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,555
And what
are you studying?

472
00:28:41,597 --> 00:28:43,515
Poli sci, minoring
in Home Ec.

473
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:46,685
- Poli Sci?
- Political Science.

474
00:28:46,768 --> 00:28:49,021
- Oh.
- It's all about what's going on.

475
00:28:49,104 --> 00:28:52,024
Is Harold interested
in what's going on?

476
00:28:52,107 --> 00:28:55,277
I just think it's such
a super thing to study.

477
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,780
Of course, I can always
fall back on my Home Ec.

478
00:28:58,864 --> 00:29:00,199
Now that's good planning.

479
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:01,450
Yes.

480
00:29:01,533 --> 00:29:04,703
Tell me, are you a regular
with this computer club?

481
00:29:04,786 --> 00:29:07,581
Oh, heavens, no! I don't have
to worry about dates.

482
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:09,082
Oh.

483
00:29:09,124 --> 00:29:12,711
But some of the other girls
in my sorority

484
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,755
decided somebody
ought to try it,

485
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,716
so we drew straws,
and I lost.

486
00:29:17,799 --> 00:29:21,178
Oh--but I-- I'm looking
forward to meeting Harold.

487
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:23,722
Well, I think
I should mention, Candy,

488
00:29:23,805 --> 00:29:26,475
Harold does have his
little eccentric moments.

489
00:29:26,558 --> 00:29:27,976
That's all right.

490
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:31,480
I have a brother
who's a real cutup, too.

491
00:29:31,522 --> 00:29:34,233
Oh, I will never
forget the time

492
00:29:34,274 --> 00:29:37,444
we had this old television set
with no parts in it.

493
00:29:37,486 --> 00:29:39,947
Tommy stuck his head
behind it

494
00:29:40,030 --> 00:29:42,449
and started giving
a whole newscast

495
00:29:42,491 --> 00:29:44,201
before the entire family.

496
00:29:44,284 --> 00:29:46,203
Must have been
very funny.

497
00:29:48,163 --> 00:29:50,165
Aah! Harold!

498
00:29:50,249 --> 00:29:51,166
Oh!

499
00:29:51,250 --> 00:29:54,169
Oh, yes, dear.
Here is Harold now.

500
00:29:54,253 --> 00:29:55,712
Harold,
this is Candy.

501
00:29:55,796 --> 00:29:59,633
Candy's just been telling
such a funny little story about--

502
00:29:59,675 --> 00:30:00,634
Oh!

503
00:30:00,676 --> 00:30:01,927
Walter
Cronkite.

504
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,970
Oh!

505
00:30:06,056 --> 00:30:08,600
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!

506
00:30:14,731 --> 00:30:17,234
# I used to walk alone #

507
00:30:17,317 --> 00:30:19,528
# Every step
seemed the same #

508
00:30:23,073 --> 00:30:25,117
# This world
was not my home #

509
00:30:25,159 --> 00:30:28,120
# So there was nothing
much to the game #

510
00:30:31,415 --> 00:30:33,500
# Look up and
see the clouds #

511
00:30:33,584 --> 00:30:37,921
# Look down and
see the cold fog #

512
00:30:39,756 --> 00:30:41,925
# Until you came
into my life, girl #

513
00:30:42,009 --> 00:30:45,012
# I saw nothing,
nothing more ##

514
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:51,518
Oh.

515
00:30:52,603 --> 00:30:54,605
- Excuse me.
- Mmm?

516
00:30:56,273 --> 00:30:57,774
I beg your pardon.

517
00:30:57,858 --> 00:30:59,443
Well, what do you want?

518
00:30:59,526 --> 00:31:02,404
I'm sorry.
I was looking for Maude.

519
00:31:02,488 --> 00:31:03,405
Harold?

520
00:31:09,828 --> 00:31:10,871
Maude.

521
00:31:13,040 --> 00:31:15,501
How about
some ginger pie?

522
00:31:15,584 --> 00:31:16,960
Fine. Thank you.

523
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,587
I'll heat some up.

524
00:31:22,424 --> 00:31:24,801
My, Harold, I'm glad
to see you again.

525
00:31:24,885 --> 00:31:27,221
Do you often
model for Glaucus?

526
00:31:27,262 --> 00:31:30,182
Oh, heavens, no.
I don't have the time.

527
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,351
But I like
to keep in practice.

528
00:31:32,434 --> 00:31:36,188
And poor Glaucus occasionally
needs his memory refreshed

529
00:31:36,271 --> 00:31:39,191
as to the contours
of the female form.

530
00:31:40,275 --> 00:31:41,652
Do you disapprove?

531
00:31:41,735 --> 00:31:43,737
Me? no. Of course not.

532
00:31:46,114 --> 00:31:47,783
Really?

533
00:31:47,866 --> 00:31:49,785
Do you think
it's wrong?

534
00:32:00,671 --> 00:32:01,588
No.

535
00:32:01,672 --> 00:32:04,299
Oh! Heavens,
I'm glad you said that.

536
00:32:04,383 --> 00:32:06,969
I want to show you
my painting.

537
00:32:07,052 --> 00:32:10,305
This is
The Rape oflRome.

538
00:32:10,389 --> 00:32:13,976
Over in the corner
is Leda and the Swan--

539
00:32:14,059 --> 00:32:15,811
a self-portrait.

540
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:19,106
And over here
is my favorite.

541
00:32:20,899 --> 00:32:23,318
It's titled...

542
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:27,739
Rainbow With Egg Underneath
and an Elephant.

543
00:32:27,823 --> 00:32:29,158
Do you like it?

544
00:32:29,199 --> 00:32:30,159
Oh, yeah.

545
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,618
Very much.

546
00:32:31,702 --> 00:32:34,121
I then became
infatuated with these--

547
00:32:34,204 --> 00:32:35,122
my odorifics.

548
00:32:35,205 --> 00:32:37,833
Give the nose a treat,
I thought--

549
00:32:37,916 --> 00:32:40,335
Have a kind of a--
a olfactory banquet.

550
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:42,880
So I began first
on the easiest--

551
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,464
roast beef, old books,

552
00:32:44,548 --> 00:32:47,509
mown grass...and
Mexican farmyard.

553
00:32:47,551 --> 00:32:49,720
Oh. Here's one you'll like.

554
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,347
Snowfall
on 42nd Street.

555
00:32:52,431 --> 00:32:53,849
I'll put it on.

556
00:32:56,435 --> 00:32:59,188
Now, you hold on
to this.

557
00:32:59,271 --> 00:33:00,606
I'll pump it up.

558
00:33:02,858 --> 00:33:05,319
OK. Now,
hold it up there.

559
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,488
Now, what
do you smell?

560
00:33:12,910 --> 00:33:14,286
Subway?

561
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:15,496
Ha ha.

562
00:33:21,168 --> 00:33:22,127
Perfume.

563
00:33:29,051 --> 00:33:29,968
Cigarettes.

564
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:40,020
Snow.

565
00:33:40,062 --> 00:33:41,021
Snow.

566
00:33:42,189 --> 00:33:44,733
Oh, it goes
on and on.

567
00:33:45,817 --> 00:33:47,277
It's just great.

568
00:33:47,319 --> 00:33:52,241
But then I decided
to switch to the tactile.

569
00:33:53,575 --> 00:33:55,035
Uh...

570
00:33:55,118 --> 00:33:56,537
what do you think?

571
00:33:56,578 --> 00:33:58,038
I like this--

572
00:33:58,080 --> 00:33:59,540
Oh, no, no, no.

573
00:33:59,581 --> 00:34:02,251
Really get close
and reach in and feel.

574
00:34:03,335 --> 00:34:05,963
Oh...there's
my kettle.

575
00:34:06,004 --> 00:34:07,631
Uh...well...

576
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,299
stroke...

577
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,134
palm...

578
00:34:11,218 --> 00:34:13,303
caress...

579
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:15,097
explore.

580
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:48,839
Unh...

581
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:51,008
Mmm.

582
00:34:56,889 --> 00:34:58,348
Here we are.

583
00:34:58,432 --> 00:35:00,767
Oat straw tea
and ginger pie.

584
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,981
Excuse the mismatched
saucers.

585
00:35:07,399 --> 00:35:09,776
This is definitely
a new experience for me.

586
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:12,821
Oh, wonderful.
Try something new each day.

587
00:35:12,863 --> 00:35:15,282
After all, we're given life
to find it out.

588
00:35:15,365 --> 00:35:16,825
It doesn't last
forever.

589
00:35:16,867 --> 00:35:19,244
You look
as if you could.

590
00:35:20,704 --> 00:35:23,290
Did I tell you
I'll be 80 on Saturday?

591
00:35:23,373 --> 00:35:24,833
You don't look 80.

592
00:35:24,917 --> 00:35:27,294
That's the influence
of the right food,

593
00:35:27,377 --> 00:35:29,838
the right exercises,
and the right breathing.

594
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:32,674
Greet the dawn with
the breath of fire.

595
00:35:33,884 --> 00:35:36,136
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

596
00:35:37,387 --> 00:35:39,723
Huh! Huh! Huh! Huh!

597
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,810
Huh! Huh! Hu...

598
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:45,812
Oh...

599
00:35:45,896 --> 00:35:47,356
well, there's
no question.

600
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,982
My body's giving out.

601
00:35:49,024 --> 00:35:50,484
I'm well into autumn.

602
00:35:50,567 --> 00:35:53,028
It's all going
to be over after Saturday.

603
00:35:53,070 --> 00:35:54,488
Tell me about yourself.

604
00:35:54,571 --> 00:35:58,116
What do you do when
you aren't visiting funerals?

605
00:36:06,542 --> 00:36:10,712
Yes, there is definitely
a certain attraction.

606
00:36:24,601 --> 00:36:28,313
I ask you, though, Harold,
is it enough?

607
00:36:29,857 --> 00:36:31,316
What do you mean?

608
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,318
Oh, well...

609
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:37,656
Mmm...

610
00:36:39,908 --> 00:36:42,703
I like to watch
things grow.

611
00:36:50,377 --> 00:36:53,505
They grow and bloom

612
00:36:53,589 --> 00:36:56,133
and fade and die

613
00:36:56,216 --> 00:36:58,135
and change
into something else.

614
00:37:00,345 --> 00:37:02,055
Ah, life.

615
00:37:03,724 --> 00:37:08,187
I should like to change
into a sunflower most of all.

616
00:37:08,270 --> 00:37:10,189
They're so tall and simple.

617
00:37:10,272 --> 00:37:13,192
What flower
would you like to be?

618
00:37:14,359 --> 00:37:16,320
I don't know.

619
00:37:16,361 --> 00:37:18,780
One of these, maybe.

620
00:37:18,864 --> 00:37:20,782
Why do you say that?

621
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:23,994
Because they're all alike.

622
00:37:24,036 --> 00:37:26,288
Oh, but they're not.

623
00:37:26,371 --> 00:37:27,831
Look. See...

624
00:37:27,873 --> 00:37:31,293
some are smaller,
some are fatter...

625
00:37:31,376 --> 00:37:34,296
some grow to the left,
some to the right.

626
00:37:34,379 --> 00:37:36,798
Some even have
lost some petals.

627
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:40,302
All kinds of
observable differences.

628
00:37:40,385 --> 00:37:42,054
You see, Harold,

629
00:37:42,137 --> 00:37:45,516
I feel that much
of the world's sorrow

630
00:37:45,557 --> 00:37:48,060
comes from people
who are this...

631
00:37:49,895 --> 00:37:54,399
yet allow themselves
to be treated as that.

632
00:37:56,693 --> 00:37:58,779
# Well, I think it's fine #

633
00:38:00,364 --> 00:38:03,242
# Buildin' jumbo planes #

634
00:38:04,535 --> 00:38:07,788
# Or takin' a ride #

635
00:38:07,871 --> 00:38:10,415
# On a cosmic train #

636
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:14,169
# Switch on summer #

637
00:38:15,337 --> 00:38:17,631
# From a slot machine #

638
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,135
#Yes, get what
you want to, if you want #

639
00:38:22,219 --> 00:38:24,304
# 'Cause you can get
anything #

640
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:31,478
# I know we've come
a long way #

641
00:38:31,520 --> 00:38:34,898
# We're changin'
day to day #

642
00:38:34,982 --> 00:38:36,149
# But tell me #

643
00:38:36,233 --> 00:38:42,322
# Where do
the children play #

644
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:55,085
# Well, you roll on roads #

645
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:59,923
# Over fresh green grass #

646
00:38:59,965 --> 00:39:02,217
# For your lorry loads #

647
00:39:04,136 --> 00:39:06,180
# Pumpin' petrol gas #

648
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,933
# And you make them long #

649
00:39:11,602 --> 00:39:13,812
# And you make them tough #

650
00:39:13,854 --> 00:39:14,855
Power steering.

651
00:39:14,938 --> 00:39:18,108
# But they just
go on and on #

652
00:39:18,192 --> 00:39:21,195
# And it seems that
you can't get off #

653
00:39:22,696 --> 00:39:27,618
# Oh, I know
we've come a long way #

654
00:39:27,701 --> 00:39:31,121
# We're changin'
day to day #

655
00:39:31,205 --> 00:39:32,331
# But tell me #

656
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:35,000
# Where do
the children play ##

657
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:45,385
Hey!

658
00:39:47,262 --> 00:39:50,599
That little tree
is in trouble. Come on.

659
00:39:50,682 --> 00:39:52,142
Look at it.

660
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,143
Oh.

661
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:55,646
It's suffocating.
Well, it's the smog.

662
00:39:55,687 --> 00:39:58,065
You know, people
can live with it,

663
00:39:58,106 --> 00:40:00,526
but trees,
it gives them asthma.

664
00:40:00,609 --> 00:40:02,069
They can't breathe.

665
00:40:02,110 --> 00:40:04,530
The leaves. Look,
they're turning brown.

666
00:40:04,613 --> 00:40:08,534
Harold, we have got to do
something about this life.

667
00:40:08,617 --> 00:40:09,535
What?

668
00:40:09,618 --> 00:40:12,079
We'll transplant it
to the forest.

669
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:13,580
You can't do that.

670
00:40:13,622 --> 00:40:14,581
Why not?

671
00:40:14,623 --> 00:40:16,041
This is public property.

672
00:40:16,124 --> 00:40:17,543
Well, exactly.

673
00:40:18,961 --> 00:40:21,421
Well, we'll need tools.

674
00:40:21,463 --> 00:40:24,424
You're right.
We'll go see Glaucus. Come on.

675
00:40:25,676 --> 00:40:27,052
Wait a minute.

676
00:40:28,136 --> 00:40:29,847
Oh, police. Come on.

677
00:40:34,977 --> 00:40:36,436
Well,
good afternoon, officer.

678
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:37,896
Bit of trouble here?

679
00:40:37,980 --> 00:40:40,065
Yes, ma'am. Someone
had trouble parking.

680
00:40:40,148 --> 00:40:41,733
That's a tricky turn.

681
00:40:41,817 --> 00:40:43,902
Tell me, that
car over there,

682
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:45,946
is that parked
all right?

683
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:47,406
Yes, ma'am, that's fine.

684
00:40:47,489 --> 00:40:48,949
Thank you so much.

685
00:40:48,991 --> 00:40:52,411
Uh, might turn the radio off.
Saves the battery.

686
00:41:22,983 --> 00:41:25,319
A little after-dinner
liqueur, Harold?

687
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,321
Thank you,
I don't drink.

688
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:29,823
Oh, it's all right.
It's organic.

689
00:41:29,907 --> 00:41:30,824
Thanks.

690
00:41:30,908 --> 00:41:32,868
It has no
nutritional value,

691
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:36,163
but consistency is not
really a human trait.

692
00:41:36,246 --> 00:41:38,207
What is that up there?

693
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:40,709
Oh, that's my umbrella.

694
00:41:40,792 --> 00:41:42,211
That's just a relic.

695
00:41:42,294 --> 00:41:45,130
I found it while packing
to come to America.

696
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,174
It used to be my defense

697
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,718
on picket lines and rallies
and political meetings--

698
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,221
being dragged off
by the police

699
00:41:52,304 --> 00:41:54,681
and attacked by the thugs
of the opposition.

700
00:41:54,765 --> 00:41:56,725
What were you
fighting for?

701
00:41:57,768 --> 00:41:59,353
Oh, big issues--

702
00:41:59,436 --> 00:42:01,647
liberty, rights, justice.

703
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,150
Kings died,
kingdoms fell.

704
00:42:05,234 --> 00:42:07,569
I don't regret
the kingdom.

705
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:13,033
What sense in borders
and nations and patriotism?

706
00:42:14,535 --> 00:42:17,246
But I miss the kings.

707
00:42:18,747 --> 00:42:20,666
When I was
a little girl,

708
00:42:20,749 --> 00:42:23,126
I was taken
to the palace in Vienna

709
00:42:23,210 --> 00:42:24,545
to a garden party.

710
00:42:24,586 --> 00:42:29,508
I can still see the sun shining,
the parasols,

711
00:42:29,591 --> 00:42:32,511
the flashing uniforms
of the young officers.

712
00:42:32,594 --> 00:42:36,014
I thought then that
I would marry a soldier.

713
00:42:38,058 --> 00:42:41,061
Later on, Frederick
would chide me about it.

714
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:45,858
He was so serious.

715
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,195
A doctor
at the university...

716
00:42:50,279 --> 00:42:51,989
and in the government.

717
00:43:04,877 --> 00:43:07,880
But that was all before.

718
00:43:17,556 --> 00:43:18,849
So...

719
00:43:22,603 --> 00:43:25,063
you don't use
the umbrella anymore.

720
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:31,320
No more revolts?

721
00:43:35,365 --> 00:43:37,326
Oh. Oh, yes.

722
00:43:37,367 --> 00:43:40,162
Oh, every day.

723
00:43:40,204 --> 00:43:43,999
But...I don't need
the defense anymore.

724
00:43:44,041 --> 00:43:46,001
I embrace.

725
00:43:46,043 --> 00:43:48,670
Still fighting
for the big issues,

726
00:43:48,754 --> 00:43:54,051
but now in my small,
individual way.

727
00:43:54,760 --> 00:43:56,345
Shall we have a song?

728
00:43:56,428 --> 00:43:58,430
I don't--
I don't play--

729
00:43:58,514 --> 00:43:59,890
Oh, come on.

730
00:43:59,973 --> 00:44:01,350
- I'll show you.
- No.

731
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:14,029
# Sing out, sing out #

732
00:44:14,112 --> 00:44:17,199
# If you want
to be free, be free #

733
00:44:17,241 --> 00:44:19,827
# 'Cause there's
a million things to be #

734
00:44:19,910 --> 00:44:23,080
#You know
that there are #

735
00:44:23,121 --> 00:44:27,209
# And if you want
to be high, be high #

736
00:44:27,292 --> 00:44:30,128
# If you want
to be low, be low #

737
00:44:30,212 --> 00:44:32,881
# 'Cause there's
a million ways to go #

738
00:44:32,965 --> 00:44:36,426
#You know
that there are #

739
00:44:36,510 --> 00:44:40,138
# And if you want
to be me, be me #

740
00:44:40,222 --> 00:44:42,808
# If you want
to be you, be you #

741
00:44:42,891 --> 00:44:45,894
# 'Cause there's
a million things to do #

742
00:44:45,978 --> 00:44:48,480
#You know
that there are #

743
00:44:48,564 --> 00:44:50,274
Harold, join in.

744
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:57,698
#You know
that there are #

745
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:01,076
#You can do what #

746
00:45:01,118 --> 00:45:03,120
#You want #

747
00:45:03,120 --> 00:45:06,248
#The opportunity's on #

748
00:45:06,331 --> 00:45:07,291
# And if you find #

749
00:45:07,332 --> 00:45:09,751
# A new way #

750
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:12,421
#You can do it today #

751
00:45:12,504 --> 00:45:15,591
#You can make it
all true #

752
00:45:15,674 --> 00:45:17,801
# And you can
make it undo #

753
00:45:17,885 --> 00:45:19,928
#You see #

754
00:45:20,012 --> 00:45:22,723
# Ah, it's easy #

755
00:45:22,806 --> 00:45:27,686
# Ah, you only need
to know #

756
00:45:29,104 --> 00:45:31,940
# If you want
to sing out, sing out #

757
00:45:32,024 --> 00:45:34,902
# And if you want
to be free, be free #

758
00:45:34,985 --> 00:45:37,488
# 'Cause there's
a million things to be #

759
00:45:37,571 --> 00:45:39,239
# You know
that there are #

760
00:45:39,281 --> 00:45:40,824
# You know that there are #

761
00:45:40,908 --> 00:45:42,284
# There are, there are #

762
00:45:42,326 --> 00:45:44,328
# You know that there are ##

763
00:45:50,918 --> 00:45:52,836
Oh, that was fun!

764
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:54,338
Let's play something
together.

765
00:45:55,881 --> 00:45:57,299
I don't play anything.

766
00:45:57,382 --> 00:45:58,675
Nothing?

767
00:45:58,759 --> 00:46:01,303
Oh...dear me.

768
00:46:01,386 --> 00:46:03,805
Everybody should be able
to make some music.

769
00:46:03,847 --> 00:46:05,307
That's the cosmic dance.

770
00:46:05,390 --> 00:46:07,100
Oh, come with me.

771
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:09,770
There has
to be something.

772
00:46:09,853 --> 00:46:11,313
Now, let me see.

773
00:46:12,356 --> 00:46:15,317
Got to oil this thing.
Oh. Hold on to this.

774
00:46:15,359 --> 00:46:16,777
Let's--What is this?

775
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,279
This is it.
There we are.

776
00:46:19,363 --> 00:46:21,782
You take--
This is the one. Take that.

777
00:46:21,865 --> 00:46:23,784
Just be impulsive.
Be fanciful.

778
00:46:23,867 --> 00:46:26,829
Let the music
flow out of you.

779
00:46:26,870 --> 00:46:29,289
You--You got
to make some chords.

780
00:46:29,373 --> 00:46:31,834
Put--Put your finger
on the second fret.

781
00:46:31,875 --> 00:46:34,878
And this one on the third.
Then this one here.

782
00:46:42,553 --> 00:46:43,554
Harold!

783
00:46:48,225 --> 00:46:49,226
Harold?

784
00:46:52,563 --> 00:46:53,730
Harold, dear!

785
00:46:55,065 --> 00:46:57,401
Oh, there you are.

786
00:46:59,903 --> 00:47:03,490
I have a little
surprise for you.

787
00:47:03,574 --> 00:47:05,242
It's a present.

788
00:47:09,746 --> 00:47:11,039
Come along.

789
00:47:33,103 --> 00:47:34,021
There.

790
00:47:35,105 --> 00:47:37,232
Isn't it darling?

791
00:47:37,274 --> 00:47:40,235
I had them take away
that monstrous thing of yours

792
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:42,362
and send this one
'round instead.

793
00:47:42,446 --> 00:47:45,240
It's so much more appropriate
for you, don't you think?

794
00:47:47,284 --> 00:47:49,203
Oh, one thing more,
Harold.

795
00:47:49,286 --> 00:47:51,747
I telephoned your second
computer date this morning,

796
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:54,583
and she seems
a very nice, quiet girl.

797
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:56,585
Cute little thing,
isn't it?

798
00:47:56,668 --> 00:47:58,587
I like it very much.

799
00:48:47,094 --> 00:48:48,679
Your license, lady?

800
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:51,682
I don't have one.
I don't believe in them.

801
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:55,811
How long you been
driving, lady?

802
00:48:55,895 --> 00:48:58,814
About, uh, 45 minutes,
wouldn't you say, Harold?

803
00:48:58,898 --> 00:49:00,858
We were hoping
to start sooner,

804
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,611
but it's rather hard
to find a truck.

805
00:49:03,694 --> 00:49:05,654
Is this your truck?

806
00:49:05,696 --> 00:49:08,115
Uh, oh, no.
I just took it.

807
00:49:08,199 --> 00:49:09,658
You just took it?

808
00:49:09,700 --> 00:49:12,661
Yes. See, I have
to plant my tree.

809
00:49:12,703 --> 00:49:14,747
Well,
it's not mine, really,

810
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:17,750
but we would like
to get it into soil

811
00:49:17,833 --> 00:49:19,501
as soon as possible.

812
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:22,838
Let me get this
straight, lady.

813
00:49:22,922 --> 00:49:24,506
All right, then, we'll be off.

814
00:49:24,548 --> 00:49:26,467
Nice chatting with you.

815
00:49:31,513 --> 00:49:32,806
He was very nice.

816
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:33,974
Yeah.

817
00:49:47,738 --> 00:49:49,490
I think
he's following us.

818
00:49:49,532 --> 00:49:51,784
Is he?

819
00:49:51,867 --> 00:49:55,746
Oh, the police. Always
wanting to play games.

820
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:10,636
Hey, lady!

821
00:50:46,922 --> 00:50:48,883
Is the little tree
all right?

822
00:50:51,176 --> 00:50:52,803
Oh, yeah. Fine.

823
00:50:52,887 --> 00:50:54,680
Terrific!

824
00:51:04,565 --> 00:51:06,317
There.

825
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:10,821
Mmm. I love the feel
of soil, don't you?

826
00:51:10,863 --> 00:51:13,032
And the smell.

827
00:51:14,992 --> 00:51:16,911
It's the earth.

828
00:51:18,037 --> 00:51:19,997
The earth is my body,

829
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:23,250
my head is in the stars.

830
00:51:23,292 --> 00:51:24,835
Who said that?

831
00:51:26,337 --> 00:51:27,796
I don't know.

832
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:31,008
I suppose I did.

833
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:36,722
Oh, isn't it wonderful?

834
00:51:36,805 --> 00:51:39,433
All around us,
living things.

835
00:52:44,290 --> 00:52:46,000
All right, out, lady.

836
00:52:48,085 --> 00:52:49,003
Come on.

837
00:52:49,086 --> 00:52:51,171
Hello.
Haven't we met before?

838
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,507
None of that, lady.
Come on out.

839
00:52:53,591 --> 00:52:55,509
It must have been
your brother.

840
00:52:55,593 --> 00:52:57,219
There is
a family resemblance.

841
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:00,973
Get out of the car.

842
00:53:01,056 --> 00:53:02,892
Just stand
over there, lady.

843
00:53:02,975 --> 00:53:04,560
Come on. Get out, buster!

844
00:53:04,643 --> 00:53:07,229
You're in a lot
of trouble, lady.

845
00:53:07,313 --> 00:53:09,732
I got you down here
for several offenses

846
00:53:09,815 --> 00:53:12,484
including possession
of a stolen vehicle,

847
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:13,986
resisting arrest,

848
00:53:14,028 --> 00:53:15,946
and possession
of a stolen tree.

849
00:53:16,030 --> 00:53:17,323
Where's the tree?

850
00:53:17,364 --> 00:53:18,908
We planted it.

851
00:53:18,991 --> 00:53:20,201
Is this your shovel?

852
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,243
No.

853
00:53:22,620 --> 00:53:24,997
Possession
of a stolen shovel.

854
00:53:25,039 --> 00:53:26,332
Don't get officious.

855
00:53:26,415 --> 00:53:28,334
You're not yourself
when you're officious.

856
00:53:28,417 --> 00:53:30,836
That is the curse
of a government job.

857
00:53:36,675 --> 00:53:38,260
Aw, lady.

858
00:53:40,471 --> 00:53:43,390
Are you going to take
a lot of time with this?

859
00:53:43,474 --> 00:53:44,391
Lady, please.

860
00:53:44,475 --> 00:53:45,935
Because if you are--

861
00:53:45,976 --> 00:53:48,187
Lady, just quiet, please.

862
00:53:52,608 --> 00:53:55,027
Grab the shovel,
Harold.

863
00:54:05,246 --> 00:54:08,374
Lady! Stop or
I'll have to shoot!

864
00:54:33,607 --> 00:54:36,151
I sure am picking up
on vices.

865
00:54:37,236 --> 00:54:38,571
Vice, virtue.

866
00:54:38,654 --> 00:54:41,031
It's best
not to be too moral.

867
00:54:41,115 --> 00:54:43,576
You cheat yourself
out of too much life.

868
00:54:43,659 --> 00:54:44,952
Aim above morality.

869
00:54:45,035 --> 00:54:47,872
If you apply that
to life,

870
00:54:47,913 --> 00:54:51,250
then you're bound
to live it fully.

871
00:54:57,256 --> 00:54:58,757
I haven't lived.

872
00:55:02,595 --> 00:55:04,847
I've died a few times.

873
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,390
What was that?

874
00:55:07,600 --> 00:55:09,185
Well...

875
00:55:09,226 --> 00:55:11,478
uh...

876
00:55:11,562 --> 00:55:16,192
the first time was when
I was at boarding school,

877
00:55:16,275 --> 00:55:17,693
in the chemistry lab.

878
00:55:17,735 --> 00:55:19,695
I was in there
cleaning it up,

879
00:55:19,737 --> 00:55:23,699
so I decided I'd do
a little experimenting,

880
00:55:23,741 --> 00:55:24,783
you know.

881
00:55:24,867 --> 00:55:28,454
So I get all this stuff out
and begin mixing it up.

882
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:29,538
Very scientific.

883
00:55:32,208 --> 00:55:34,835
There was this
massive explosion.

884
00:55:34,919 --> 00:55:36,378
It knocked me down,

885
00:55:36,420 --> 00:55:39,006
blew out a huge hole
in the floor.

886
00:55:39,089 --> 00:55:41,425
There was boards
and bricks

887
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,219
and flames
leaping up.

888
00:55:43,302 --> 00:55:47,890
I figured, you know,
time to leave.

889
00:55:47,973 --> 00:55:50,935
My career in school
was over.

890
00:55:51,018 --> 00:55:53,354
So, uh...

891
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:55,105
I went home.

892
00:55:55,147 --> 00:55:57,233
My mother
was giving a party,

893
00:55:57,316 --> 00:56:00,903
so I went up the back stairs
into my room,

894
00:56:00,986 --> 00:56:02,279
turned out the light,

895
00:56:02,363 --> 00:56:05,908
and, uh, I got
this funny feeling.

896
00:56:05,991 --> 00:56:07,993
The doorbell rang.

897
00:56:08,077 --> 00:56:10,162
I went out
into the banister,

898
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:12,498
and these two
policemen came in,

899
00:56:12,581 --> 00:56:15,417
found my mother,

900
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:18,879
and, uh...told her

901
00:56:18,963 --> 00:56:23,634
that I was killed
in the fire.

902
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:26,679
She put one hand
up to her forehead.

903
00:56:26,762 --> 00:56:29,223
With the other one,
she reached out,

904
00:56:29,306 --> 00:56:30,975
as if groping
for support,

905
00:56:31,058 --> 00:56:34,520
and with
this long sigh,

906
00:56:34,603 --> 00:56:38,190
she collapsed
in their arms.

907
00:57:06,760 --> 00:57:09,221
I decided right then

908
00:57:09,305 --> 00:57:13,142
that I'd enjoy
being dead.

909
00:57:13,184 --> 00:57:15,144
I understand.

910
00:57:15,227 --> 00:57:17,771
A lot of people
enjoy being dead,

911
00:57:17,855 --> 00:57:20,274
but they're not dead,
really.

912
00:57:20,357 --> 00:57:24,737
They're just
backing away from life.

913
00:57:24,820 --> 00:57:27,907
Reach out.
Take a chance.

914
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:29,909
Get hurt, even.

915
00:57:29,992 --> 00:57:33,537
But play
as well as you can.

916
00:57:33,621 --> 00:57:36,248
Go, team, go!

917
00:57:36,332 --> 00:57:37,958
Gimme an "L,"
Gimme an "I,"

918
00:57:38,042 --> 00:57:39,793
Gimme a "V,"
Gimme an "E."

919
00:57:39,877 --> 00:57:42,796
L-I-V-E. Live!

920
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:48,219
Otherwise you got nothing
to talk about in the locker room.

921
00:57:58,521 --> 00:57:59,980
I likeyou, Maude.

922
00:58:00,064 --> 00:58:01,482
Hmm.

923
00:58:01,565 --> 00:58:05,528
I likeyou, Harold.

924
00:58:05,611 --> 00:58:07,488
[The Blue Danube
Waltz Plays]

925
00:58:39,728 --> 00:58:41,939
Harold is down
at the garage.

926
00:58:42,022 --> 00:58:44,275
He's been tuning up
his new car.

927
00:58:44,316 --> 00:58:45,609
He's very mechanical.

928
00:58:45,693 --> 00:58:47,611
What kind of car
is it?

929
00:58:47,695 --> 00:58:49,488
It's a little jaguar.

930
00:58:49,572 --> 00:58:50,489
Oh.

931
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:54,201
Looks like a hearse.

932
00:58:55,411 --> 00:58:57,746
Very nice.
You know--compact.

933
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:00,916
Edith, I'd like you
to meet my son Harold.

934
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:02,793
Harold,
this is Edith...

935
00:59:02,835 --> 00:59:04,962
- Phern.
- Phern.

936
00:59:05,045 --> 00:59:07,006
Very pleased to make
your acquaintance.

937
00:59:07,089 --> 00:59:09,508
I think you should
wash up, dear,

938
00:59:09,592 --> 00:59:12,469
and join us
in the drawing room.

939
00:59:12,553 --> 00:59:15,014
And what do you do,
my dear?

940
00:59:15,097 --> 00:59:16,307
I'm a file clerk

941
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:17,850
at Harrison
Feed and Grain.

942
00:59:17,933 --> 00:59:20,477
Well, what is it
exactly that you do?

943
00:59:20,561 --> 00:59:24,523
I'm in charge of all the invoices
for the southwest.

944
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,524
How interesting.

945
00:59:25,566 --> 00:59:27,026
And we supply,
for example,

946
00:59:27,067 --> 00:59:29,528
most of the egg farmers
in Petaluma,

947
00:59:29,612 --> 00:59:30,863
so you can imagine.

948
00:59:30,946 --> 00:59:32,239
Yes.

949
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:36,493
Oh, here's Harold now.

950
00:59:36,577 --> 00:59:38,454
Don't get up, dear.

951
00:59:44,418 --> 00:59:47,338
Edith has been talking
about her job.

952
00:59:47,421 --> 00:59:48,839
I'm a file clerk.

953
00:59:48,923 --> 00:59:50,341
Henderson
Feed and Grain.

954
00:59:50,424 --> 00:59:51,342
Harrison.

955
00:59:51,425 --> 00:59:52,843
Harrison
Feed and Grain.

956
00:59:52,927 --> 00:59:54,470
It's at Hamilton
and 4th.

957
00:59:54,553 --> 00:59:56,764
I'm in charge
of the invoices.

958
00:59:57,973 --> 01:00:00,559
I type the schedule
for the trucking fleet.

959
01:00:00,643 --> 01:00:03,687
She supplies the whole southwest
with chicken feed.

960
01:00:03,771 --> 01:00:06,357
Well, not exactly
the whole southwest,

961
01:00:06,398 --> 01:00:08,526
although we do
a large business.

962
01:00:08,609 --> 01:00:10,861
Barley was very big
last week--

963
01:00:10,945 --> 01:00:12,530
1,500...

964
01:00:12,613 --> 01:00:13,531
bushels.

965
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:36,846
In view of your
recent actions,

966
01:00:36,929 --> 01:00:39,974
I find you have left me
with no recourse

967
01:00:40,057 --> 01:00:42,977
but to listen to the solution
proposed by your uncle.

968
01:00:43,060 --> 01:00:46,146
Consequently, I have
instructed him forthwith

969
01:00:46,188 --> 01:00:48,274
to induct you
into the service,

970
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,109
and, for your own good,

971
01:00:50,192 --> 01:00:54,738
to take up active duty
with the United States Army.

972
01:00:54,822 --> 01:00:59,660
And I hope they have
more luck with you than I.

973
01:01:00,953 --> 01:01:04,415
Maude, they're
going to draft me.

974
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:06,375
Well, don't go.

975
01:01:06,458 --> 01:01:08,377
They'll put me in jail.

976
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,505
Well, historically,
you'd be in very good company.

977
01:01:17,052 --> 01:01:18,637
Maude, can you help me?

978
01:01:20,055 --> 01:01:22,474
With your skill
and my experience,

979
01:01:22,516 --> 01:01:25,060
I think we can
come up with something.

980
01:01:26,228 --> 01:01:29,106
Harold, look at me
like your father in this.

981
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:32,109
I know you have no desire
to join the army,

982
01:01:32,151 --> 01:01:34,612
but once you're in,
you'll love it.

983
01:01:34,695 --> 01:01:35,946
It's a great life.

984
01:01:35,988 --> 01:01:37,114
Look at me--

985
01:01:37,156 --> 01:01:40,451
chauffeur, respect,
money in the bank.

986
01:01:40,534 --> 01:01:44,955
Oh, it has its drawbacks
like anything else, I suppose.

987
01:01:45,039 --> 01:01:47,333
But the army
takes care of you,

988
01:01:47,416 --> 01:01:50,628
and you've got
a buddy for life.

989
01:01:53,047 --> 01:01:54,840
Good idea,
coming out here, Harold.

990
01:01:54,882 --> 01:01:56,175
It's a lovely spot.

991
01:01:56,258 --> 01:01:57,468
Thank you, Uncle.

992
01:01:57,551 --> 01:01:58,844
Call me sir, Harold.

993
01:01:58,886 --> 01:02:01,680
It's the first thing
you learn in the army--

994
01:02:01,722 --> 01:02:03,474
an officer
deserves your respect.

995
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,434
Yes, sir.

996
01:02:06,477 --> 01:02:09,355
Now let's examine
the facts on it.

997
01:02:09,396 --> 01:02:12,024
I say this country's
been too harsh

998
01:02:12,107 --> 01:02:14,693
in its outright
condemnation ofwar.

999
01:02:14,777 --> 01:02:17,530
You can point to the many
material advantages

1000
01:02:17,613 --> 01:02:20,533
brought about by a crisis
in conflict policy.

1001
01:02:20,616 --> 01:02:24,703
Why, hell, World War II
gave us the ballpoint pen.

1002
01:02:24,787 --> 01:02:27,665
During wartime, the national
suicide rate goes down.

1003
01:02:27,706 --> 01:02:28,958
Is that a fact?

1004
01:02:29,041 --> 01:02:32,503
Why in hell did we
give up on the Germans?

1005
01:02:32,545 --> 01:02:34,505
Because the damn politicians
in Washington

1006
01:02:34,547 --> 01:02:36,507
chalked them up
on our side.

1007
01:02:36,549 --> 01:02:39,802
The wars ever since have
been a national disgrace.

1008
01:02:39,885 --> 01:02:41,178
Hell, look at history.

1009
01:02:41,220 --> 01:02:43,639
The two best wars
this country ever fought

1010
01:02:43,722 --> 01:02:44,974
were against the jerries.

1011
01:02:45,057 --> 01:02:48,185
Get the krauts across
the fence where they belong.

1012
01:02:48,227 --> 01:02:50,813
Let's get back to the kind
of enemy worth killing

1013
01:02:50,855 --> 01:02:53,649
and the kind ofwar
this country can support.

1014
01:02:53,732 --> 01:02:57,152
Wow. That's pretty
strong stuff, sir.

1015
01:02:57,236 --> 01:03:01,156
Well, I've always been a man
that speaks his piece.

1016
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:02,700
Always hurt me.

1017
01:03:02,741 --> 01:03:06,787
I'm not liked in Washington.
I know that.

1018
01:03:06,871 --> 01:03:09,957
But I do have friends
in high places.

1019
01:03:12,042 --> 01:03:13,419
Rat-tat-tat-tat-tat!

1020
01:03:13,502 --> 01:03:15,546
They kept falling. Shock!

1021
01:03:15,588 --> 01:03:18,591
Joe falls back,
a neat hole in his head.

1022
01:03:18,674 --> 01:03:19,925
Tat-tat-tat-tat!

1023
01:03:20,009 --> 01:03:22,928
Only one thing kept
going through my mind--

1024
01:03:23,012 --> 01:03:25,014
Kill! Kill!

1025
01:03:25,097 --> 01:03:28,517
For joe and Mac
and the rest of the guys!

1026
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:29,685
Kill!

1027
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:32,313
And then there was
a blinding flash!

1028
01:03:35,524 --> 01:03:38,694
And I woke up
on a stretcher.

1029
01:03:42,239 --> 01:03:45,201
"Did we hold? "
I asked the medic.

1030
01:03:46,327 --> 01:03:47,828
"Yes, sir!" he said.

1031
01:03:52,041 --> 01:03:56,337
And I slipped
into unconsciousness.

1032
01:03:57,463 --> 01:03:58,839
Boy.

1033
01:03:58,923 --> 01:04:02,343
Wow. That's
a terrific story, sir.

1034
01:04:03,552 --> 01:04:05,513
Well...

1035
01:04:05,596 --> 01:04:08,474
you'll have stories like that
to tell of your own someday.

1036
01:04:08,516 --> 01:04:09,975
Do you think so, sir?

1037
01:04:10,059 --> 01:04:11,268
Sure, you will.

1038
01:04:11,310 --> 01:04:14,772
Gee, I never dreamed
it could be that exciting.

1039
01:04:14,855 --> 01:04:17,608
It's the most exciting thing
in the world, Harold.

1040
01:04:17,691 --> 01:04:21,153
To pit your own life
against another.

1041
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:22,238
Yes.

1042
01:04:22,321 --> 01:04:24,114
To kill.

1043
01:04:24,198 --> 01:04:27,034
The taste ofblood
in your mouth.

1044
01:04:27,117 --> 01:04:29,036
The moment of truth.

1045
01:04:29,119 --> 01:04:31,956
Another man's life
in your sight!

1046
01:04:32,039 --> 01:04:32,957
Yes!

1047
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:35,125
Will they really
teach me to shoot?

1048
01:04:35,209 --> 01:04:37,628
Sure, they will,
a variety ofweapons.

1049
01:04:37,670 --> 01:04:38,963
To use a bayonet?

1050
01:04:39,046 --> 01:04:40,047
Yes!

1051
01:04:40,089 --> 01:04:41,882
How about
hand-to-hand combat?

1052
01:04:41,924 --> 01:04:42,883
Yes.

1053
01:04:42,925 --> 01:04:44,510
To strangle someone,
choke him,

1054
01:04:44,593 --> 01:04:47,513
squeeze out his life
in your own bare hands!

1055
01:04:47,596 --> 01:04:49,557
I think you're
getting carried away.

1056
01:04:49,598 --> 01:04:53,060
- How about to slit his throat?
- I don't know about that.

1057
01:04:53,143 --> 01:04:54,353
How about souvenirs?

1058
01:04:54,436 --> 01:04:55,354
Souvenirs?

1059
01:04:55,437 --> 01:04:56,730
Of your kill.

1060
01:04:56,814 --> 01:04:59,984
Eyes, ears, nose,
scalp, privates?

1061
01:05:00,025 --> 01:05:01,235
Harold!

1062
01:05:01,318 --> 01:05:04,238
What would be the chance
of getting one of these?

1063
01:05:04,321 --> 01:05:06,699
Boy, to think
I could make my own!

1064
01:05:06,782 --> 01:05:08,325
Harold,
that's disgusting!

1065
01:05:08,409 --> 01:05:09,827
It certainly is!

1066
01:05:09,869 --> 01:05:11,328
Madam, who are you?

1067
01:05:11,412 --> 01:05:13,831
I am petitioning
for peace.

1068
01:05:13,873 --> 01:05:15,833
- Parasite!
- Harold!

1069
01:05:15,916 --> 01:05:17,835
I came out here
to speak.

1070
01:05:17,918 --> 01:05:20,004
Commie bastard!
Get out of here!

1071
01:05:20,087 --> 01:05:22,006
Don't talk to me
like that,

1072
01:05:22,089 --> 01:05:23,340
you foul-mouthed
degenerate!

1073
01:05:23,424 --> 01:05:25,384
Traitor! Benedict Arnold!
Remember Nathan Hale!

1074
01:05:25,426 --> 01:05:26,677
Harold,
calm down.

1075
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:27,678
Commie pig!

1076
01:05:27,761 --> 01:05:29,930
Don't you advance
on me.

1077
01:05:30,014 --> 01:05:31,932
You'll all end up
like this!

1078
01:05:32,016 --> 01:05:32,933
Ooh!

1079
01:05:33,017 --> 01:05:34,226
Just like this!

1080
01:05:34,310 --> 01:05:35,769
Harold!

1081
01:05:35,853 --> 01:05:38,772
Give me that!
I'll throw that in the sewer.

1082
01:05:38,856 --> 01:05:39,773
Madam, please.

1083
01:05:39,857 --> 01:05:41,066
She took my head.

1084
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:42,443
Now calm down,
Harold.

1085
01:05:42,484 --> 01:05:43,777
She took my head!

1086
01:05:43,861 --> 01:05:44,778
Harold!

1087
01:05:44,862 --> 01:05:46,780
I'll kill her!
I'll kill her!

1088
01:05:46,864 --> 01:05:47,781
Harold! Harold!

1089
01:05:47,865 --> 01:05:48,908
Aah!

1090
01:05:48,991 --> 01:05:50,618
Madam,
give back the head!

1091
01:05:50,701 --> 01:05:51,911
Let's
have no trouble!

1092
01:05:51,994 --> 01:05:53,078
Harold!

1093
01:05:53,162 --> 01:05:54,455
I'll kill you!

1094
01:05:54,538 --> 01:05:55,456
Madam!

1095
01:05:55,539 --> 01:05:56,624
I'll kill you!

1096
01:05:56,707 --> 01:05:58,167
Harold! Damn you!

1097
01:05:58,209 --> 01:05:59,585
Let's have no trouble!

1098
01:05:59,627 --> 01:06:00,628
Aah!

1099
01:06:00,669 --> 01:06:01,962
You took my head!

1100
01:06:02,004 --> 01:06:03,005
You pig!

1101
01:06:03,047 --> 01:06:04,340
I'll kill you!

1102
01:06:04,423 --> 01:06:05,716
Help!

1103
01:06:05,799 --> 01:06:06,717
Harold!

1104
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:07,968
I'll kill you!

1105
01:06:08,052 --> 01:06:09,386
I'll kill you!

1106
01:06:09,428 --> 01:06:11,222
Let go, Uncle!
Let go!

1107
01:06:11,305 --> 01:06:12,264
Harold!

1108
01:06:12,306 --> 01:06:13,641
Stop that!

1109
01:06:15,893 --> 01:06:17,645
Harold!

1110
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:38,958
What have you done?

1111
01:06:44,463 --> 01:06:45,381
Maude.

1112
01:06:45,464 --> 01:06:46,465
Hmm?

1113
01:06:48,592 --> 01:06:50,094
Do you pray?

1114
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:56,433
Pray? No.
I communicate.

1115
01:06:56,517 --> 01:06:58,269
With God?

1116
01:06:58,352 --> 01:07:00,312
With life.

1117
01:07:04,358 --> 01:07:06,110
This is real nice.

1118
01:07:06,151 --> 01:07:07,152
Yeah.

1119
01:07:07,194 --> 01:07:09,321
Makes me want
to do somersaults.

1120
01:07:09,405 --> 01:07:11,490
Well, why don't you?

1121
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:12,950
I'd feel stupid.

1122
01:07:12,992 --> 01:07:16,495
Harold,
everyone has the right

1123
01:07:16,579 --> 01:07:18,664
to make an ass
of themselves.

1124
01:07:18,747 --> 01:07:21,667
You can't let the world
judge you too much.

1125
01:07:40,644 --> 01:07:41,937
Uh...

1126
01:07:42,021 --> 01:07:45,941
do you care to join me
in a little cartwheel?

1127
01:07:46,025 --> 01:07:49,820
No. I feel
more like yelling.

1128
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:52,615
Raah!

1129
01:07:52,698 --> 01:07:54,533
Aooga--

1130
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:03,250
# Well, if you want
to sing out, sing out #

1131
01:08:03,334 --> 01:08:06,921
# And if you want
to be free, be free #

1132
01:08:07,004 --> 01:08:10,341
# 'Cause there's
a million things to be #

1133
01:08:10,424 --> 01:08:12,426
#You know that there are #

1134
01:08:14,470 --> 01:08:17,973
# And if you want
to be me, be me #

1135
01:08:18,057 --> 01:08:21,644
# And if you want
to be you, be you #

1136
01:08:21,727 --> 01:08:25,105
# 'Cause there's
a million things to do #

1137
01:08:25,147 --> 01:08:26,982
#You know that there are #

1138
01:08:30,027 --> 01:08:32,571
#You can do what you want #

1139
01:08:33,822 --> 01:08:36,951
#The opportunity's on #

1140
01:08:37,034 --> 01:08:39,787
# And if you
find a new way #

1141
01:08:40,913 --> 01:08:43,624
#You can do it today #

1142
01:08:44,708 --> 01:08:48,128
#You can make it
all true #

1143
01:08:48,212 --> 01:08:52,466
# And you can
make it undo, you see #

1144
01:08:56,637 --> 01:08:58,305
Maude.

1145
01:08:59,807 --> 01:09:03,102
I had the most
wonderful day today,

1146
01:09:03,185 --> 01:09:04,186
and...

1147
01:09:06,146 --> 01:09:07,815
you're
very beautiful.

1148
01:09:09,942 --> 01:09:11,610
Oh, Harold.

1149
01:09:13,946 --> 01:09:17,199
You make me feel
like a schoolgirl.

1150
01:09:25,416 --> 01:09:28,002
Shall I come
and visit you tomorrow?

1151
01:09:28,085 --> 01:09:29,420
Oh, I can't.

1152
01:09:29,503 --> 01:09:31,797
I have
a luncheon date

1153
01:09:31,839 --> 01:09:33,549
with a girl.

1154
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:35,968
Oh.

1155
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:39,346
I don't even know her.
My mother arranged it.

1156
01:09:43,184 --> 01:09:44,768
Look.

1157
01:09:44,852 --> 01:09:46,312
Oh.

1158
01:09:46,395 --> 01:09:49,356
Dreyfus once wrote
from Devil's Island

1159
01:09:49,440 --> 01:09:53,027
that he would see
the most glorious birds.

1160
01:09:53,068 --> 01:09:55,070
Many years later
in Brittany,

1161
01:09:55,154 --> 01:09:59,283
he realized they had
only been seagulls.

1162
01:09:59,366 --> 01:10:02,661
# Ah-ah-ah, it's easy #

1163
01:10:02,745 --> 01:10:06,165
# Ah-ah-ah,
you only need to know #

1164
01:10:06,248 --> 01:10:10,044
For me, they will always
be glorious birds.

1165
01:10:10,085 --> 01:10:13,297
# Well, if you want
to sing out, sing out #

1166
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:16,926
# And if you want
to be free, be free #

1167
01:10:17,009 --> 01:10:20,137
# 'Cause there's
a million things to be #

1168
01:10:20,221 --> 01:10:21,680
# You know that there are #

1169
01:10:21,764 --> 01:10:22,890
#You know that there are #

1170
01:10:22,973 --> 01:10:24,266
#You know that there are #

1171
01:10:24,350 --> 01:10:27,728
#You know that there are #

1172
01:10:27,770 --> 01:10:31,690
#You know that there are ##

1173
01:10:35,319 --> 01:10:36,320
Now, Harold,

1174
01:10:36,403 --> 01:10:38,864
I cannot impress upon you
too strongly

1175
01:10:38,906 --> 01:10:40,324
the importance
of this meeting.

1176
01:10:40,407 --> 01:10:43,160
This is the last girl,
so kindly remember

1177
01:10:43,244 --> 01:10:45,746
that this is your third
and final chance.

1178
01:10:45,746 --> 01:10:48,165
And please try
to be serious, Harold.

1179
01:10:48,249 --> 01:10:50,668
If not for your sake,
for hers.

1180
01:10:50,709 --> 01:10:52,503
There she is.

1181
01:10:52,586 --> 01:10:54,964
Sunshine, I'd like you
to meet Harold.

1182
01:10:55,047 --> 01:10:57,132
Harold, this is
Sunshine Dore.

1183
01:10:57,216 --> 01:10:58,425
How--

1184
01:10:58,467 --> 01:10:59,927
How do you do?

1185
01:11:00,010 --> 01:11:02,805
Oh, I can't
complain.

1186
01:11:02,847 --> 01:11:04,932
Sunshine is an actress,
Harold.

1187
01:11:05,015 --> 01:11:06,976
I like to think so.

1188
01:11:07,059 --> 01:11:08,018
Oh, wonderful.

1189
01:11:08,102 --> 01:11:11,105
Why don't you go down
to the music room,

1190
01:11:11,146 --> 01:11:13,691
and I'll follow on later
with some drinks?

1191
01:11:13,774 --> 01:11:16,527
Oh, perhaps Starlight
would like a cigarette.

1192
01:11:16,610 --> 01:11:18,070
No. Sunshine.

1193
01:11:18,153 --> 01:11:20,114
Oh, yes, of course.

1194
01:11:20,197 --> 01:11:21,532
Sunshine.

1195
01:11:40,301 --> 01:11:42,261
Would you like
a cigarette?

1196
01:11:42,303 --> 01:11:45,764
No, thank you.
They stain my fingers.

1197
01:11:45,848 --> 01:11:48,142
Is Sunshine
your real name?

1198
01:11:48,225 --> 01:11:51,812
Well, actually, it was the name
of my drama teacher.

1199
01:11:51,896 --> 01:11:53,314
Louis Sunshine.

1200
01:11:53,355 --> 01:11:55,107
Perhaps
you've heard of him.

1201
01:11:55,191 --> 01:11:57,151
He was
such an influence

1202
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,987
on the development
of my instrument.

1203
01:12:00,029 --> 01:12:03,699
That means my body
in theater talk.

1204
01:12:03,782 --> 01:12:07,411
Dore is my real name.

1205
01:12:07,494 --> 01:12:10,539
Well, Dorr, actually.

1206
01:12:10,623 --> 01:12:11,832
Oh, my!

1207
01:12:11,916 --> 01:12:15,753
What a lovely place
you have here.

1208
01:12:25,346 --> 01:12:27,181
Oh, do you play?

1209
01:12:27,264 --> 01:12:28,807
No.

1210
01:12:28,891 --> 01:12:32,311
I am learning the ba--
the harmonica.

1211
01:12:33,562 --> 01:12:37,525
Oh! Is this your father?

1212
01:12:37,608 --> 01:12:38,859
No.

1213
01:12:38,943 --> 01:12:40,361
My Uncle Victor.

1214
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:42,530
He's in the army.

1215
01:12:42,613 --> 01:12:46,492
I do so like
the military, don't you?

1216
01:12:46,575 --> 01:12:49,495
Oh, what a wonderful
collection of knives!

1217
01:12:49,578 --> 01:12:50,663
May I see--

1218
01:12:50,746 --> 01:12:52,706
No, no. Don't touch.
They're very old.

1219
01:12:52,706 --> 01:12:55,084
Do you enjoy knives?

1220
01:12:55,167 --> 01:12:56,877
Oh, yes.

1221
01:12:56,961 --> 01:12:59,797
You might find this one
particularly interesting.

1222
01:12:59,880 --> 01:13:02,132
It's a hara-kiri blade.

1223
01:13:03,843 --> 01:13:05,427
What's hara-kiri?

1224
01:14:12,620 --> 01:14:14,288
Aah!

1225
01:14:23,172 --> 01:14:24,715
Sukiyaki.

1226
01:14:32,973 --> 01:14:36,018
Oh...

1227
01:14:36,101 --> 01:14:38,270
Harold.

1228
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:42,024
Oh, that was marvelous.

1229
01:14:42,107 --> 01:14:44,777
Oh, it had
the ring of truth.

1230
01:14:44,860 --> 01:14:49,114
I played juliet
in the Sunshine Playhouse.

1231
01:14:49,198 --> 01:14:52,368
Louie thought it was
my best performance.

1232
01:14:55,538 --> 01:14:56,539
What's here?

1233
01:14:56,622 --> 01:15:00,292
A cup, closed
in my true love's hand?

1234
01:15:02,586 --> 01:15:08,342
Poison, I see, hath been
his timeless end.

1235
01:15:08,425 --> 01:15:13,097
O happy dagger!

1236
01:15:13,180 --> 01:15:16,267
O happy dagger!

1237
01:15:16,350 --> 01:15:18,394
This is thy sheath.

1238
01:15:18,477 --> 01:15:20,646
There rest--ooh!

1239
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,232
And let me die--

1240
01:15:23,315 --> 01:15:24,984
Oh!

1241
01:15:25,067 --> 01:15:28,863
Ooh!

1242
01:15:48,215 --> 01:15:50,050
Harold!

1243
01:15:55,181 --> 01:15:57,766
That was
your last date.

1244
01:16:12,406 --> 01:16:14,033
- Aah!
- Aah!

1245
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:16,285
- Aah!
- Aah!

1246
01:16:33,260 --> 01:16:34,386
Gee.

1247
01:16:34,386 --> 01:16:36,680
It wasn't very scary.

1248
01:16:36,764 --> 01:16:39,725
No. It had nothing
on this afternoon.

1249
01:16:39,808 --> 01:16:42,019
Oh, come on.
You loved it.

1250
01:16:42,102 --> 01:16:43,687
It was
a new experience.

1251
01:16:43,771 --> 01:16:45,606
Ha ha ha ha.

1252
01:17:23,519 --> 01:17:25,855
Oh!

1253
01:17:25,938 --> 01:17:27,314
Perfect!

1254
01:17:27,398 --> 01:17:29,316
Come on,
give us another one!

1255
01:17:36,782 --> 01:17:38,826
- Yay!
- Yay!

1256
01:17:41,787 --> 01:17:44,707
You sure have
a way with people.

1257
01:17:44,748 --> 01:17:47,668
Well, they're
my species.

1258
01:17:51,297 --> 01:17:53,048
Look at these stars.

1259
01:17:53,090 --> 01:17:54,216
Mmm.

1260
01:17:58,304 --> 01:17:59,388
Maude...

1261
01:18:00,472 --> 01:18:01,557
Yeah?

1262
01:18:08,564 --> 01:18:09,815
Here.

1263
01:18:11,567 --> 01:18:13,319
A gift.

1264
01:18:16,405 --> 01:18:17,406
Ahh...

1265
01:18:19,575 --> 01:18:22,161
"Harold
loves Maude."

1266
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,669
And Maude
loves Harold.

1267
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:36,175
This is
the nicest present

1268
01:18:36,258 --> 01:18:39,094
that I've received
in years.

1269
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:53,192
So I'll always know
where it is.

1270
01:19:14,421 --> 01:19:16,590
# I think
I see the light #

1271
01:19:16,674 --> 01:19:18,634
# Comin' to me #

1272
01:19:18,717 --> 01:19:21,345
# Comin' through me #

1273
01:19:21,387 --> 01:19:24,265
# Givin' me
a second sight #

1274
01:19:26,892 --> 01:19:29,979
# So shine,
shine, shine #

1275
01:19:30,062 --> 01:19:33,148
# Shine, shine, shine #

1276
01:19:33,232 --> 01:19:35,901
# Shine, shine, shine #

1277
01:19:35,985 --> 01:19:38,737
# Shine, shine, shine #

1278
01:19:38,779 --> 01:19:41,490
# Shine, shine, shine #

1279
01:19:41,574 --> 01:19:46,036
# Shine, shine, shine ##

1280
01:19:51,458 --> 01:19:53,586
Oh, could I speak
with Fay, please?

1281
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:56,881
Fay?

1282
01:19:56,964 --> 01:19:59,258
Darling, I know
Rene will be furious,

1283
01:19:59,300 --> 01:20:02,553
but...ifhe knew what
I had to put up with

1284
01:20:02,636 --> 01:20:04,263
in the last few days.

1285
01:20:04,346 --> 01:20:05,556
- Mother.
- Not now, dear.

1286
01:20:05,639 --> 01:20:07,308
So could you
take me Monday?

1287
01:20:07,391 --> 01:20:09,185
I'd like
to talk to you.

1288
01:20:09,226 --> 01:20:11,187
I'm on the phone, dear.

1289
01:20:11,228 --> 01:20:13,022
I'm getting married.

1290
01:20:13,105 --> 01:20:14,899
What did you say?

1291
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,402
I'm getting married.

1292
01:20:20,404 --> 01:20:21,989
Hold the line, Fay.

1293
01:20:24,283 --> 01:20:26,952
To whom?

1294
01:20:32,625 --> 01:20:36,545
I suppose you think
this is very funny, Harold.

1295
01:20:36,587 --> 01:20:38,214
A sunflower.

1296
01:20:44,595 --> 01:20:47,848
You can't be serious.

1297
01:21:11,497 --> 01:21:14,833
Your mother spoke to me
about your marriage plan,

1298
01:21:14,917 --> 01:21:16,335
and although normally

1299
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:18,379
I have nothing
against marriage,

1300
01:21:18,420 --> 01:21:21,841
I don't think
this is quite, uh...

1301
01:21:21,924 --> 01:21:23,175
normal.

1302
01:21:23,217 --> 01:21:24,844
Avery common neurosis,

1303
01:21:24,927 --> 01:21:27,513
particularly
in this society,

1304
01:21:27,596 --> 01:21:29,682
whereby the male child

1305
01:21:29,765 --> 01:21:33,352
subconsciously wishes
to sleep with his mother.

1306
01:21:33,435 --> 01:21:36,188
Of course,
what puzzles me, Harold,

1307
01:21:36,272 --> 01:21:39,692
is that you want to sleep
with your grandmother.

1308
01:21:39,733 --> 01:21:42,528
I would be remiss
in my duty

1309
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:45,364
if I did not tell you

1310
01:21:45,447 --> 01:21:47,533
that the idea of...

1311
01:21:49,618 --> 01:21:51,745
intercourse...

1312
01:21:54,123 --> 01:21:56,876
the fact
of your firm young...

1313
01:21:58,460 --> 01:21:59,879
body...

1314
01:22:03,299 --> 01:22:05,551
commingling...

1315
01:22:06,719 --> 01:22:09,346
with the...

1316
01:22:09,388 --> 01:22:11,307
withered flesh...

1317
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:16,187
sagging...breasts...

1318
01:22:17,396 --> 01:22:20,316
and...flabby...

1319
01:22:22,568 --> 01:22:23,694
bu...

1320
01:22:25,946 --> 01:22:27,990
buttocks...

1321
01:22:29,617 --> 01:22:31,827
makes me want...

1322
01:22:34,413 --> 01:22:36,916
to vomit.

1323
01:22:37,041 --> 01:22:38,792
Mmm.

1324
01:22:48,093 --> 01:22:51,347
Oh, Harold...

1325
01:22:51,430 --> 01:22:54,517
it's...dazzling.

1326
01:22:58,437 --> 01:23:01,357
[Humming
The Blue Danube Waltz]

1327
01:23:25,422 --> 01:23:28,008
You've thought
of everything.

1328
01:23:28,092 --> 01:23:30,678
And champagne.

1329
01:23:30,761 --> 01:23:32,680
It's all right.
It's organic.

1330
01:23:35,057 --> 01:23:36,475
- Oh, Harold.
- Wait.

1331
01:23:40,396 --> 01:23:41,522
For you.

1332
01:23:46,777 --> 01:23:47,987
And, uh...

1333
01:23:49,947 --> 01:23:51,532
after dinner...

1334
01:23:59,456 --> 01:24:01,792
one more little
surprise...

1335
01:24:04,044 --> 01:24:07,423
that, I hope,
will make you very happy.

1336
01:24:07,506 --> 01:24:09,758
Oh, Harold...

1337
01:24:09,800 --> 01:24:12,178
I am happy.

1338
01:24:18,309 --> 01:24:22,271
I couldn't imagine
a lovelier farewell.

1339
01:24:25,316 --> 01:24:27,359
Farewell?

1340
01:24:27,443 --> 01:24:30,279
Yes, it's
my 90th birthday.

1341
01:24:32,865 --> 01:24:34,909
Well, you're not
going anywhere....

1342
01:24:37,369 --> 01:24:38,287
are you?

1343
01:24:38,370 --> 01:24:39,914
Yes, dear.

1344
01:24:39,997 --> 01:24:43,125
I took the tablets
an hour ago.

1345
01:24:43,209 --> 01:24:45,628
I'll be gone
by midnight.

1346
01:25:01,977 --> 01:25:03,896
What?

1347
01:25:08,984 --> 01:25:12,947
What a fuss this is--
So unnecessary.

1348
01:25:12,988 --> 01:25:15,950
Don't die, Maude,
for Christ's sake.

1349
01:25:15,991 --> 01:25:17,743
Oh, Harold.

1350
01:25:17,826 --> 01:25:22,373
Oh, don't upset
yourself so.

1351
01:25:23,541 --> 01:25:25,042
I love you.

1352
01:25:25,125 --> 01:25:26,585
I love you.

1353
01:25:28,796 --> 01:25:31,257
Oh, Harold...

1354
01:25:31,298 --> 01:25:34,552
that's wonderful.

1355
01:25:35,803 --> 01:25:39,223
Go and love some more.

1356
01:25:40,641 --> 01:25:41,892
No.

1357
01:25:43,811 --> 01:25:45,771
Never.

1358
01:25:45,813 --> 01:25:47,940
Never.

1359
01:25:48,023 --> 01:25:49,775

01:25:49,817 --> 01:25:53,571

# You're eatin'

1373
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:46,373

for me today #

# Oh, trouble,
can't you see #

1381
01:27:14,151 --> 01:27:16,278
# You have made me
a wreck #

1382
01:27:16,362 --> 01:27:19,698
# Now won't you
leave me in my misery #

1383
01:27:22,326 --> 01:27:27,331
# I've seen your eyes #

1384
01:27:27,414 --> 01:27:30,751
# And I can see
death's disguise #

1385
01:27:30,835 --> 01:27:34,129
# Hangin' on me #

1386
01:27:34,213 --> 01:27:35,881
