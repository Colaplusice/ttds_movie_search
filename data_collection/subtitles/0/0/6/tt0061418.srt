1
00:04:16,662 --> 00:04:17,822
Hey, boy!

2
00:04:18,664 --> 00:04:20,632
What are you doing with my mama's car?

3
00:04:28,307 --> 00:04:29,331
Wait there!

4
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:48,649
Ain't you ashamed?

5
00:04:49,494 --> 00:04:51,359
Trying to steal an
old lady's automobile?

6
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:53,096
Oh, come on, now,
what are you talking about?

7
00:04:53,198 --> 00:04:54,358
I've been thinking about buying me one.

8
00:04:54,867 --> 00:04:55,856
Bull!

9
00:04:56,368 --> 00:04:59,166
You ain't got money for dinner,
let alone buying a car.

10
00:05:00,372 --> 00:05:02,169
Well, ma'am, I'll tell you something.

11
00:05:04,676 --> 00:05:06,667
I've got enough money
for a Coca-Cola...

12
00:05:07,012 --> 00:05:09,503
...and since it don't look like
you're going to invite me inside...

13
00:05:09,882 --> 00:05:12,373
You'd steal the dining
room table if I did.

14
00:05:13,685 --> 00:05:16,017
You want to go into town with me?
How would that be?

15
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,687
I'm going to work, anyway.

16
00:05:20,692 --> 00:05:23,889
You're going to work?
What kind of work do you do?

17
00:05:24,196 --> 00:05:25,390
None of your business.

18
00:05:26,198 --> 00:05:27,893
I'll bet you're a movie star.

19
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,531
A lady mechanic.

20
00:05:31,703 --> 00:05:32,692
A maid?

21
00:05:33,038 --> 00:05:34,699
What do you think I am?

22
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,200
A waitress.

23
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:47,211
What line of work are you in?
When you're not stealing cars?

24
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,553
I tell you, I'm looking for suitable
employment right at the moment.

25
00:05:51,924 --> 00:05:53,551
Oh, yes, but what did you do before?

26
00:05:53,926 --> 00:05:56,918
I was in State Prison.

27
00:05:57,429 --> 00:05:58,418
State Prison?

28
00:06:02,734 --> 00:06:06,067
Well, I guess, some little
old lady wasn't so nice.

29
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:10,067
It was armed robbery.

30
00:06:16,748 --> 00:06:19,945
The things that turn up in
the street these days.

31
00:06:27,259 --> 00:06:30,751
What do you all do for a good time
around here? Listen to the grass grow?

32
00:06:31,596 --> 00:06:34,463
I guess you had a lot more
fun up at State Prison.

33
00:06:36,969 --> 00:06:38,459
I tell you. You see my right foot?

34
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:42,763
I chopped two toes off
that foot with an axe.

35
00:06:43,108 --> 00:06:44,268
What! Why?

36
00:06:44,609 --> 00:06:46,600
To get off of work detail.
You want to see it?

37
00:06:50,983 --> 00:06:54,783
I surely don't intend to stand
here in the middle of Main Street...

38
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,281
...and look at your dirty feet!

39
00:07:06,131 --> 00:07:07,621
Boy, did you really do that?

40
00:07:23,515 --> 00:07:25,005
What's it like?

41
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:28,513
What do you mean, prison?

42
00:07:31,823 --> 00:07:33,313
Armed robbery.

43
00:07:41,033 --> 00:07:42,330
It ain't like anything.

44
00:07:43,835 --> 00:07:47,532
Shoot. I knew you never
robbed any place, you faker.

45
00:08:14,066 --> 00:08:16,557
Bet you wouldn't have
the gumption to use it.

46
00:08:25,377 --> 00:08:28,210
You just wait right here and
you keep your eyes open.

47
00:09:01,913 --> 00:09:03,244
What's your name?

48
00:09:04,249 --> 00:09:05,113
Clyde Barrow.

49
00:09:06,118 --> 00:09:08,109
Hi, I'm Bonnie Parker.
Pleased to meet you.

50
00:09:36,448 --> 00:09:39,144
Hey, hey, slow down,
slow down.

51
00:09:40,152 --> 00:09:42,313
Take it easy, you've
got my hand trapped.

52
00:09:42,654 --> 00:09:43,985
Cut it out! Cut it out!

53
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:55,997
All right, now.

54
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:59,793
I might as well tell you right off.
I ain't much of a lover boy.

55
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:02,162
That don't mean nothing
personal about you.

56
00:10:03,808 --> 00:10:05,673
I never saw no percentage in it.

57
00:10:06,178 --> 00:10:08,305
Ain't nothing wrong with me.
I don't like boys.

58
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:15,342
Boy! Boy! Boy!

59
00:10:17,355 --> 00:10:18,344
"Boy," what?

60
00:10:18,823 --> 00:10:21,018
Your advertising is just dandy.

61
00:10:21,193 --> 00:10:23,320
Folks would never guess
you don't have a thing to sell.

62
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,229
You'd better take me home now.

63
00:10:29,067 --> 00:10:30,557
- Now, wait a minute.
- Now don't you touch me.

64
00:10:33,738 --> 00:10:35,069
All right, all right...

65
00:10:35,907 --> 00:10:38,034
...if all you want is a stud service,
you get on back to West Dallas,

66
00:10:38,109 --> 00:10:40,577
...and you stay there,
the rest of your life.

67
00:10:42,581 --> 00:10:43,673
You're worth more than that,
a lot more than that,

68
00:10:43,715 --> 00:10:45,410
...and you know it, and that's why
you're comin' along with me.

69
00:10:48,253 --> 00:10:50,414
You could find a lover boy on
every damn corner in town.

70
00:10:50,755 --> 00:10:52,689
It don't make a damn to them if you're
waiting on tables or picking cotton,

71
00:10:52,724 --> 00:10:54,248
...but it does make a damn to me.

72
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,384
Why?

73
00:10:58,730 --> 00:11:01,255
Why, what do you mean why?
Because you're different, that's why.

74
00:11:01,933 --> 00:11:03,230
You know, you're like me.
You want different things.

75
00:11:03,735 --> 00:11:05,760
You've got something
better than being a waitress.

76
00:11:07,606 --> 00:11:10,404
You and me traveling together, we could
cut a path clean across this state...

77
00:11:10,442 --> 00:11:14,902
...and Kansas and Missouri and Oklahoma,
and everybody would know about it.

78
00:11:15,146 --> 00:11:17,614
You listen to me, Miss Bonnie Parker.
You listen to me.

79
00:11:17,949 --> 00:11:19,712
Now, how would you like to go
walking into the dining room...

80
00:11:19,751 --> 00:11:21,275
...of the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas...

81
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,088
...wearing a nice silk dress and
have everybody waiting on you?

82
00:11:24,856 --> 00:11:26,949
Would you like that?
That seem like a lot to ask?

83
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,953
That ain't enough for you.
You've got a right to that.

84
00:11:35,467 --> 00:11:37,298
When did you figure all that up?

85
00:11:38,303 --> 00:11:39,463
The minute I saw you.

86
00:11:43,441 --> 00:11:45,432
Because you may be the
best damn girl in Texas.

87
00:11:58,156 --> 00:12:00,147
You were born somewhere
around east Texas, right?

88
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,321
Come from a big old family.

89
00:12:07,165 --> 00:12:08,462
You went to school, of course,
but you didn't take to it much...

90
00:12:08,533 --> 00:12:10,330
...because you were a lot
smarter than everybody else...

91
00:12:10,835 --> 00:12:12,325
...so you just up and quit one day.

92
00:12:13,171 --> 00:12:17,005
Now, when you were 16... 17,
there was a guy who worked in a...

93
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:18,831
Cement plant.

94
00:12:19,177 --> 00:12:20,166
Right, cement plant.
And you liked him,

95
00:12:20,245 --> 00:12:23,009
...because he thought you were
just as nice as you could be.

96
00:12:23,348 --> 00:12:26,181
You almost married that guy, but then you
thought no, you didn't think you would.

97
00:12:26,518 --> 00:12:28,418
So then you got your job in a cafe.

98
00:12:28,486 --> 00:12:30,317
And now you wake up every
morning and you hate it.

99
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:36,187
You just hate it. You get on down there
and you put on your white uniform...

100
00:12:37,362 --> 00:12:38,351
It's pink.

101
00:12:38,697 --> 00:12:41,427
And those truck drivers come in there
to eat your greasy burgers and...

102
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:45,026
...they kid you and you kid them back
but they're stupid and dumb boys...

103
00:12:45,370 --> 00:12:46,860
...with their big old tattoos
on them, and you don't like it.

104
00:12:47,872 --> 00:12:50,204
They ask you for dates and sometimes
you go, but you mostly don't because...

105
00:12:50,542 --> 00:12:53,534
...all they're trying to do is get in your
pants, whether you want them to or not.

106
00:12:54,045 --> 00:12:55,876
So you go on home and you
sit in your room and...

107
00:12:56,214 --> 00:12:58,705
...you think, now when, and how...

108
00:12:59,551 --> 00:13:01,883
...am I ever going to
get away from this?

109
00:13:05,056 --> 00:13:06,387
And now you know.

110
00:13:18,236 --> 00:13:20,227
Change that. I don't like it.

111
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,590
You're a knock-out!

112
00:13:56,775 --> 00:13:58,265
That ain't ours.

113
00:13:59,444 --> 00:14:00,775
No, but we came in this one.

114
00:14:01,112 --> 00:14:02,773
That don't mean we
have to go home in it.

115
00:14:42,487 --> 00:14:43,977
Where have you been keeping yourself?

116
00:14:44,322 --> 00:14:45,812
I slept out by the car.

117
00:14:47,659 --> 00:14:49,820
These accommodations ain't
particularly deluxe.

118
00:14:50,161 --> 00:14:52,152
If they're after us,
I want the first shot.

119
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,164
Now, you come on out here.
We got some work to do.

120
00:15:06,344 --> 00:15:07,504
Sheww! You're good.

121
00:15:07,846 --> 00:15:09,177
I ain't good. I'm the best.

122
00:15:09,514 --> 00:15:10,674
And modest.

123
00:15:12,350 --> 00:15:14,682
Now, see that there now?
Set her spinning.

124
00:15:21,526 --> 00:15:23,517
It's all right, all right.
Come on, now, try it again.

125
00:15:23,862 --> 00:15:26,524
And try and get, now this
time come down slow.

126
00:15:34,539 --> 00:15:37,201
How about that? Now, ain't
you something? I tell you.

127
00:15:37,542 --> 00:15:40,375
Look, I'm going to get you a Smith &
Wesson. Go in your hand easier. Ok?

128
00:15:40,712 --> 00:15:42,202
Now, I want you to try something now.

129
00:15:45,016 --> 00:15:46,847
No, sir! No, sir!

130
00:15:49,053 --> 00:15:50,042
You all go right ahead.

131
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:06,059
Used to be my place.
But it's not anymore.

132
00:16:08,573 --> 00:16:10,063
Bank took it.

133
00:16:15,914 --> 00:16:17,745
Yes, sir, they moved us off.

134
00:16:18,583 --> 00:16:20,244
Now it belongs to them.

135
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:25,750
Why, that's a pitiful shame.

136
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:27,421
You're damn right, ma'am.

137
00:16:33,064 --> 00:16:35,430
Me and him put in the years here.

138
00:16:38,603 --> 00:16:42,767
You all go right ahead.
We just come by for a last look.

139
00:17:04,762 --> 00:17:05,751
You all mind?

140
00:17:06,097 --> 00:17:08,088
Hey, Davis!
Come on over here!

141
00:17:22,447 --> 00:17:23,436
That's right.

142
00:17:28,453 --> 00:17:29,442
Go on.

143
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:44,156
Much obliged.

144
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:47,960
My name is Otis Harris. This is Davis.
We worked this place.

145
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:50,130
How're you?
This here's Miss Bonnie Parker.

146
00:17:50,475 --> 00:17:52,136
- Glad to meet you.
- I'm Clyde Barrow.

147
00:17:58,516 --> 00:17:59,847
We rob banks.

148
00:18:10,528 --> 00:18:12,519
Look, I don't want you
to worry about nothing.

149
00:18:13,531 --> 00:18:15,829
This is going to be
the easiest thing in the world.

150
00:18:15,867 --> 00:18:16,856
Your mama could take this bank.

151
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,374
You just be ready if I need you.

152
00:18:55,406 --> 00:18:56,737
What are you waiting for?

153
00:19:07,085 --> 00:19:10,077
This is a stick-up! Just take it easy
and nothing's going to happen to you.

154
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,082
Give me the money.

155
00:19:13,591 --> 00:19:14,751
Give me the money.

156
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:17,755
What money, mister?
There ain't no money here.

157
00:19:20,264 --> 00:19:21,754
What are you talking about?
This here's a bank, ain't it?

158
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:26,597
Well, it was a bank, but
we failed three weeks ago.

159
00:19:34,278 --> 00:19:36,109
All right, now, you get on out there.

160
00:19:46,124 --> 00:19:47,614
You get on out there and tell my girl.

161
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:52,786
Come on, you tell her
what you told me.

162
00:20:27,498 --> 00:20:29,830
We've got $1.98 and you're laughing!

163
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:43,903
Let's see now. A loaf of
bread, a dozen eggs...

164
00:20:44,248 --> 00:20:47,240
...quart of milk, four fried pies.

165
00:20:54,258 --> 00:20:56,419
Come on now, you sure you
ain't got no peach pies?

166
00:21:23,321 --> 00:21:24,345
Get the hell out of here!

167
00:21:26,691 --> 00:21:27,680
Go ahead! Go ahead!

168
00:21:32,129 --> 00:21:36,122
He tried to kill me. Why'd he try to
kill me? I didn't want to hurt him.

169
00:21:37,702 --> 00:21:38,691
Try to get something to eat around here,

170
00:21:38,769 --> 00:21:41,294
...and some son-of-a-bitch
comes up on you with a meat-cleaver.

171
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:44,972
I ain't against him.

172
00:21:52,149 --> 00:21:53,309
I ain't against him.

173
00:22:25,182 --> 00:22:26,171
Now, you just tell me what
was wrong with that.

174
00:22:26,517 --> 00:22:27,347
Dirt.

175
00:22:29,186 --> 00:22:31,347
Dirt in the fuel line.
Just blowed it away.

176
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,016
Excuse me, ma'am, is there
anything else I could do for you?

177
00:22:39,030 --> 00:22:40,361
Well, you're a smart feller.

178
00:22:41,032 --> 00:22:44,195
You sure do know a lot about
automobiles, don't you?

179
00:22:46,203 --> 00:22:48,034
Yes. I guess I do.

180
00:22:52,209 --> 00:22:54,200
Would you know what kind of car this is?

181
00:22:56,047 --> 00:22:58,379
This is a 4 cylinder Ford coupe.

182
00:23:01,719 --> 00:23:03,550
Sure, sure is.

183
00:23:04,722 --> 00:23:08,886
This is a stolen, four
cylinder Ford coupe.

184
00:23:12,897 --> 00:23:14,228
Hey, you ain't scared, are you?

185
00:23:21,906 --> 00:23:23,237
I believe he is.

186
00:23:24,408 --> 00:23:26,876
That's a pity now. We sure could
have used a smart boy like that...

187
00:23:26,978 --> 00:23:29,071
...who knows such a great
deal about automobiles.

188
00:23:33,084 --> 00:23:34,415
Hey, you a good driver?

189
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:37,410
Yeah, reckon I am.

190
00:23:39,590 --> 00:23:41,581
No, he's better off here.

191
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:43,920
What's your name, boy?

192
00:23:44,762 --> 00:23:45,922
C.W. Moss.

193
00:23:45,997 --> 00:23:49,933
I'm Miss Bonnie Parker and
this here is Mr. Clyde Barrow.

194
00:23:50,768 --> 00:23:52,429
We rob banks.

195
00:24:05,182 --> 00:24:06,615
There ain't nothing wrong
with that, is it?

196
00:24:11,455 --> 00:24:13,116
Clyde, he ain't
the one. Let's go.

197
00:24:14,959 --> 00:24:16,620
You think you got the guts
for our line of work?

198
00:24:16,961 --> 00:24:20,954
What are you talking about?
I spent a year in reformatory.

199
00:24:21,465 --> 00:24:22,796
A man with a record.

200
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:25,796
I know you got the nerve to short
change old ladies coming in for gas...

201
00:24:26,137 --> 00:24:29,129
...what I'm asking you is have you got
what it takes to pull bank jobs with us?

202
00:24:32,810 --> 00:24:36,143
Sure, I do. I ain't afraid,
if that's what you think.

203
00:24:36,547 --> 00:24:37,809
Prove it.

204
00:25:07,411 --> 00:25:08,400
You're gonna be all right.

205
00:27:22,713 --> 00:27:24,704
I'm afraid we're overdrawn again.

206
00:27:26,317 --> 00:27:27,306
This is a stick-up!

207
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,480
This here's a stick-up!

208
00:27:32,723 --> 00:27:33,712
Leave it there.
Leave it there.

209
00:27:50,007 --> 00:27:51,838
Come on, everything.
Get it up here.

210
00:28:08,092 --> 00:28:09,423
Clyde, where's the car?

211
00:28:21,205 --> 00:28:23,537
What the hell you doing,
parking the car?

212
00:28:34,218 --> 00:28:35,549
Stop that car!

213
00:28:37,888 --> 00:28:39,719
Up ahead, cut left!

214
00:28:53,404 --> 00:28:56,737
"We're in the money, the sky is sunny.

215
00:28:57,241 --> 00:29:00,404
"Old man depression, you are
through, you done us wrong.

216
00:29:01,412 --> 00:29:04,575
"We never see a headline,
about a bread line, today.

217
00:29:05,082 --> 00:29:08,916
"And when we see the landlord, we
can look that guy right in the eye.

218
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,077
"Oh, we're in the money,
Come on, my honey."

219
00:29:12,423 --> 00:29:14,084
You ain't got a brain in your skull.

220
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:25,924
On account of you, I killed a man.

221
00:29:26,036 --> 00:29:29,267
And now we're all going to be wanted
for murder, and that's you too, boy.

222
00:29:40,784 --> 00:29:42,615
Dumb head! Stupid!

223
00:29:43,954 --> 00:29:45,444
What were you thinking about?

224
00:29:48,125 --> 00:29:50,457
Do a dumb ass thing like that
again, I'm going to kill you.

225
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:54,791
If you boys want to talk,
why don't you all go outside?

226
00:30:35,072 --> 00:30:39,065
Come on, I want to talk to you
for just a minute. Sit down.

227
00:30:44,415 --> 00:30:47,077
This afternoon we killed
a man and we were seen.

228
00:30:47,751 --> 00:30:49,412
So far, nobody
knows who you are...

229
00:30:49,753 --> 00:30:51,084
...but they know who I am and
they're going to be running after me,

230
00:30:51,255 --> 00:30:52,586
...and anybody who's running with me.

231
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:54,921
And that's murder.
Now it's going to get rough.

232
00:30:56,093 --> 00:30:57,583
I can't get out, but
right now you still can.

233
00:30:57,928 --> 00:30:59,395
I want you to say the word to me,

234
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:01,591
...and I'm going to put you on that bus
back to your mama...

235
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:04,590
...because you mean a lot to me, and
I ain't going to make you run with me.

236
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:17,440
Now, I ain't a rich man. You could
get a rich man if you tried.

237
00:31:17,781 --> 00:31:19,772
I don't want no rich man!

238
00:31:27,124 --> 00:31:28,785
You ain't going to
have a minute's peace.

239
00:31:29,626 --> 00:31:30,615
You promise?

240
00:34:12,456 --> 00:34:13,946
Least I'm not a liar.

241
00:34:26,803 --> 00:34:28,794
I told you I wasn't no lover boy.

242
00:34:58,669 --> 00:35:00,660
Let me look at you boy.

243
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,001
Oh, boy, you can do better than that.

244
00:35:13,850 --> 00:35:15,511
Hey, how's mama?

245
00:35:16,019 --> 00:35:18,510
Oh, fine, fine. Sister
sent her best to you.

246
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:20,516
Filling out there, boy.
Must be that prison food.

247
00:35:20,857 --> 00:35:23,189
No, no, it's married life...

248
00:35:23,527 --> 00:35:25,688
...you know what they say...

249
00:35:26,029 --> 00:35:28,361
...it's the face powder that
gives a man interest...

250
00:35:28,699 --> 00:35:30,860
...but it's the baking powder
that keeps him home.

251
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,701
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

252
00:35:36,206 --> 00:35:37,537
This is my baby brother.

253
00:35:37,708 --> 00:35:39,539
How're you doing?
It's really nice to know you.

254
00:35:39,609 --> 00:35:40,701
How do you do?

255
00:35:53,223 --> 00:35:55,885
I hear you're taking real good care
of the baby of the family...

256
00:35:56,059 --> 00:35:58,050
I'm just so glad to meet you.
Come on over here.

257
00:35:58,195 --> 00:35:59,389
I want you to meet my wife, Blanche.

258
00:36:04,234 --> 00:36:06,566
Everybody, this is C.W. Moss.

259
00:36:07,070 --> 00:36:08,230
My brother, Buck, and his wife, Blanche.

260
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:12,231
Howdy, everybody.
Howdy, you all.

261
00:36:13,076 --> 00:36:16,739
Howdy, Mrs. Barrow, or may
I call you Blanche?

262
00:36:17,581 --> 00:36:19,071
I sure am pleased to meet you.

263
00:36:19,249 --> 00:36:21,240
How did you find us here
in this neck of the woods?

264
00:36:21,585 --> 00:36:23,746
You sure picked a good day for it.

265
00:36:24,588 --> 00:36:25,919
Is that a new Screenland Magazine?

266
00:36:27,591 --> 00:36:29,582
Are there any new pictures of
Myrna Loy in there?

267
00:36:29,659 --> 00:36:32,093
She's my favorite picture star.

268
00:36:33,096 --> 00:36:35,587
Let me get the Kodak here.
We'll take some pictures.

269
00:36:35,932 --> 00:36:37,263
Come on, put your pants on.
We're going to take some pictures.

270
00:36:37,434 --> 00:36:38,423
Come on Blanche,
get out of there!

271
00:36:39,770 --> 00:36:42,933
I'm a mess.
Been driving all day.

272
00:36:48,779 --> 00:36:53,113
Did you take my picture? I declare.
I asked you not to take my picture.

273
00:36:53,784 --> 00:36:55,615
Hey, Buck, get one of this.

274
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,951
Brother, I want to talk
to you later on.

275
00:37:05,962 --> 00:37:06,951
You got that?

276
00:37:08,965 --> 00:37:11,126
You take one of me and
my missus, here, Clyde.

277
00:37:12,969 --> 00:37:16,803
I don't want a picture taken.

278
00:37:20,310 --> 00:37:21,800
Be serious. Be serious.

279
00:37:25,482 --> 00:37:27,643
Let me take one of Bonnie alone.
Come on, honey.

280
00:37:39,663 --> 00:37:41,153
Hey, a little smile.

281
00:37:41,832 --> 00:37:42,821
Don't want to smile?

282
00:37:45,335 --> 00:37:47,269
Come on, I want to have a chat with
you. C.W., take the girls' pictures.

283
00:37:48,271 --> 00:37:50,501
Why don't you step
in there with Bonnie?

284
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:52,338
What did you think of her?

285
00:37:55,345 --> 00:37:56,676
She's a peach.

286
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:05,351
Now, tell me true.

287
00:38:07,691 --> 00:38:09,181
Is she as good as she looks?

288
00:38:12,529 --> 00:38:13,518
She's better.

289
00:38:21,037 --> 00:38:24,029
Listen, it was, either you
or him, wasn't it?

290
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:27,032
The guy that you killed, you had
to do it, didn't you?

291
00:38:27,377 --> 00:38:28,708
He put me on the spot. I had to.

292
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:30,034
You had to do it, right?

293
00:38:32,716 --> 00:38:35,708
I know you did. Don't say
anything to Blanche about that.

294
00:38:38,722 --> 00:38:42,055
That time you broke out of jail, that
true she talked you into going back?

295
00:38:42,392 --> 00:38:44,053
You hear about that?

296
00:38:47,063 --> 00:38:49,725
Well, I won't say nothing
to Bonnie about it.

297
00:38:50,066 --> 00:38:51,397
I appreciate that.

298
00:39:02,412 --> 00:39:04,573
We're going to have
ourselves a time, boy!

299
00:39:04,681 --> 00:39:05,670
We surely are.

300
00:39:12,589 --> 00:39:13,749
What are we going to do?

301
00:39:18,094 --> 00:39:21,586
I figured we all drive up to Missouri.

302
00:39:21,932 --> 00:39:22,921
They ain't looking for me up there.

303
00:39:23,099 --> 00:39:26,091
We find a nice little place to hole up in.
We have us a regular vacation.

304
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:32,597
No trouble now.

305
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:34,941
I ain't looking to go back to no prison.

306
00:39:35,278 --> 00:39:37,109
I heard in prison that you had
a little trouble there.

307
00:39:37,247 --> 00:39:38,771
You were cutting on your toes.

308
00:39:40,116 --> 00:39:41,947
You heard about that?

309
00:39:42,118 --> 00:39:44,609
I did a little toe cutting.
That ain't but half of it.

310
00:39:44,955 --> 00:39:45,944
I did it so I could get off
of work detail.

311
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:48,616
Breaking those rocks with a
sledge hammer night and day.

312
00:39:48,959 --> 00:39:51,792
And you know what?
The very next week I got paroled.

313
00:39:52,796 --> 00:39:55,287
I walk out of that God-
forsaken jail on crutches.

314
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,131
Ain't life grand?

315
00:40:07,978 --> 00:40:11,812
You want to hear a story, about
this boy, he owned a dairy farm...

316
00:40:12,315 --> 00:40:14,306
And his old ma, she was
kind of sick, you know.

317
00:40:14,651 --> 00:40:17,643
And the doctor, he called
him over and said...

318
00:40:17,988 --> 00:40:21,480
"...Listen, your ma, just lying there,
she's just so sick and she's weakly...

319
00:40:23,159 --> 00:40:26,322
"...I want you to try to persuade
her to take a little brandy."

320
00:40:26,663 --> 00:40:28,494
"Just to pick her spirits up."

321
00:40:28,832 --> 00:40:33,326
"Ma's a teetotaler," he says,
"she wouldn't touch a drop."

322
00:40:34,004 --> 00:40:36,336
"Well, I'll tell you what you do."
That's the doc.

323
00:40:36,673 --> 00:40:37,833
"Now, I tell you what you do..."

324
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:41,841
"...you bring in a fresh quart
of milk every day..."

325
00:40:42,178 --> 00:40:45,011
"...and you put some brandy in it, see.
And you try that."

326
00:40:45,348 --> 00:40:49,341
So he did, and he doctored it all up
with the brandy, fresh milk...

327
00:40:49,686 --> 00:40:53,349
...and gave it to his mama, and she drank
a little bit of it. She didn't, you know.

328
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:58,184
So next day he brought it in again,
and she drank a little more.

329
00:40:58,495 --> 00:41:02,022
And so then, it went on that way,
the third day just a little more...

330
00:41:02,365 --> 00:41:05,198
...and the fourth day she was, you
know, took a little bit more...

331
00:41:05,535 --> 00:41:09,027
...and then finally, a week later,
he gave her the milk...

332
00:41:09,372 --> 00:41:12,535
...and she just drank it down, she
swallowed the whole thing...

333
00:41:12,876 --> 00:41:14,207
...and she called him
over and she said...

334
00:41:14,544 --> 00:41:18,036
"...Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

335
00:41:31,895 --> 00:41:33,726
All right, you got the
keys now, haven't you?

336
00:41:51,748 --> 00:41:55,240
I gave him a month's rent in advance.
We're all set. Let's get inside.

337
00:41:59,756 --> 00:42:01,747
Honey, I'm taking
you to our first home.

338
00:42:02,425 --> 00:42:04,086
"Here comes the bride."

339
00:42:04,427 --> 00:42:06,258
What do you think, honey?

340
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,920
Just perfect.

341
00:42:10,100 --> 00:42:11,431
This is your first home.

342
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:15,265
He gave me the grocery number.

343
00:42:22,612 --> 00:42:24,102
4-3-3-7, please.

344
00:42:25,448 --> 00:42:28,781
Hi, there, Speedie's Groceries?
I want to order up a mess of groceries.

345
00:42:29,285 --> 00:42:31,776
And a Frigidaire, not an ice-box.

346
00:42:37,627 --> 00:42:40,619
Eight pounds of pork chops,
four pounds of red beans.

347
00:42:43,633 --> 00:42:46,124
About eight bottles of Dr. Pepper.

348
00:42:58,314 --> 00:43:00,305
You sure can play checkers.

349
00:43:09,659 --> 00:43:12,651
You need a haircut. You're
looking just like a hillbilly boy.

350
00:43:12,996 --> 00:43:15,328
You are just like an old man.

351
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:18,498
Playing checkers all the time, don't pay
any attention to your little old wife.

352
00:43:18,835 --> 00:43:21,326
You ain't going to ever beat me,
but you just keep trying.

353
00:43:22,839 --> 00:43:27,003
Oh, Daddy, you sure do need a haircut.

354
00:43:27,343 --> 00:43:30,335
Why, you look like a little
old hillbilly, I do declare.

355
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:33,513
Oh, mercy me, don't.

356
00:43:33,850 --> 00:43:36,683
Don't talk that way when she's
right there in the next room.

357
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:39,011
There is always somebody in
the next room, in this room,

358
00:43:39,189 --> 00:43:41,180
...or in every other kind of room.

359
00:43:44,194 --> 00:43:46,185
Don't you ever just want
to be alone with me?

360
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:48,687
I always feel like we're alone.

361
00:43:50,366 --> 00:43:51,697
Do you, baby?

362
00:43:52,035 --> 00:43:53,195
I'm hungry.

363
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:07,205
Groceries, ma'am.

364
00:44:10,053 --> 00:44:12,317
- How much?
- Six dollars and 43 cents.

365
00:44:30,406 --> 00:44:31,896
Here, ma'am, let me help you with...
those bags are heavy.

366
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:33,573
No, thanks, I'll get them.

367
00:44:34,410 --> 00:44:35,900
Just get the door.

368
00:44:53,096 --> 00:44:55,587
"But few of them really
are justified...

369
00:44:55,932 --> 00:44:58,093
"...if you get right down to the point.

370
00:44:59,102 --> 00:45:03,095
"You've heard of a woman's glory
being spent on a downright cur."

371
00:45:03,606 --> 00:45:05,096
Did you write all that yourself?

372
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:07,773
Do you want to hear this or not?

373
00:45:09,946 --> 00:45:13,609
"Still you can't always
judge the story as true...

374
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:15,781
"...being told by her.

375
00:45:18,621 --> 00:45:21,283
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

376
00:45:21,624 --> 00:45:23,956
"...though her features
were coarse and tough."

377
00:45:24,294 --> 00:45:25,124
I knew that old gal.

378
00:45:25,628 --> 00:45:28,620
She was cock-eyed and she
had a hare lip and no teeth.

379
00:45:32,135 --> 00:45:33,966
"Now Sal was a gal of rare beauty...

380
00:45:34,470 --> 00:45:37,303
"...though her features
were coarse and tough.

381
00:45:37,640 --> 00:45:41,974
"She never once faltered from
duty, to play on the up and up.

382
00:45:43,479 --> 00:45:46,312
"Sal told me this tale on the evening...

383
00:45:46,816 --> 00:45:48,807
"...before she was turned out free.

384
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:53,315
"And I'll do my best to relate it,
just as she told it to me.

385
00:45:53,656 --> 00:45:57,649
Hey! The laws are outside!
They're blocking the driveway.

386
00:46:12,842 --> 00:46:15,174
- Please get us out of here.
- Shut up!

387
00:46:17,347 --> 00:46:19,508
They got us blocked.
We've got to get the car out.

388
00:47:00,556 --> 00:47:01,716
Where's Blanche?

389
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:23,905
You almost got us killed!

390
00:47:24,747 --> 00:47:28,410
What did I do wrong? I thought
you'd be happy if I got shot!

391
00:47:28,751 --> 00:47:32,084
Yeah! It would have saved
us all a lot of trouble!

392
00:47:32,755 --> 00:47:34,245
Don't let that woman
talk to me like that!

393
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:36,581
You shouldn't have done that.
It was a dumb thing to do.

394
00:47:38,895 --> 00:47:41,921
Oh, Buck, please, I didn't marry
you to see you get shot.

395
00:47:43,766 --> 00:47:45,757
Let's leave. Let's get out
of here and leave.

396
00:47:45,835 --> 00:47:47,427
Tell him to please stop
the car and let us out.

397
00:47:49,939 --> 00:47:51,429
I killed a guy. Now we're in this.

398
00:47:53,943 --> 00:47:54,773
Will you shut up!

399
00:47:55,111 --> 00:47:56,601
Just shut up your big mouth!

400
00:47:56,946 --> 00:47:58,106
At least do that much.

401
00:47:58,448 --> 00:47:59,437
Cut it out, Bonnie!

402
00:48:02,118 --> 00:48:04,279
Stop the car. I want to talk to you.

403
00:48:21,304 --> 00:48:22,464
Get rid of her.

404
00:48:22,805 --> 00:48:24,136
I can't, she's Buck's wife.

405
00:48:24,474 --> 00:48:25,463
Then, get rid of them both.

406
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:26,968
Why? What's the matter
with you, anyway?

407
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:28,641
She is what's the matter with me.

408
00:48:28,978 --> 00:48:32,470
She's nothing but a dumb,
stupid, back-country hick.

409
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,139
She ain't got a brain in her head.

410
00:48:35,485 --> 00:48:37,646
What makes you any better?
What makes you so damn special?

411
00:48:37,987 --> 00:48:41,150
You were just a West Dallas waitress.
Spent your time picking up truck drivers.

412
00:48:42,992 --> 00:48:46,484
Oh, big Clyde Barrow!
You're just like your brother!

413
00:48:46,996 --> 00:48:49,157
Ignorant, uneducated, hillbilly!

414
00:48:49,499 --> 00:48:52,832
Listen, the only special thing about you
is your peculiar ideas about love-making,

415
00:48:53,169 --> 00:48:55,000
...which is no love-making at all.

416
00:49:08,017 --> 00:49:11,009
Oh, Clyde, please, I didn't mean that.

417
00:49:11,354 --> 00:49:15,017
Listen, it, it was just all,
all that shooting...

418
00:49:15,358 --> 00:49:18,850
...and all those guns. I got so scared.
Please, I didn't mean it.

419
00:50:03,406 --> 00:50:04,896
"Law enforcement officers...

420
00:50:05,241 --> 00:50:08,074

We ain't going to see another
toilet for another thirty miles.

440
00:51:11,741 --> 00:51:13,140
Why don't you pull up
over here?

441
00:51:25,554 --> 00:51:26,646
Here's something.

442
00:51:28,324 --> 00:51:30,155
"Lone cop arrests two

All right, now you just get
on right over to that car.

454
00:52:42,064 --> 00:52:45,397
Look here. We're in the custody
of Captain Frank Hamer...

455
00:52:45,735 --> 00:52:48,067
Frank here is a Texas Ranger.

456
00:52:49,238 --> 00:52:52,730
Say, peace-maker, I believe you got
your spurs all tangled up there.

457
00:52:53,576 --> 00:52:55,066
You're in Missouri, do you
know that, friend?

458
00:52:56,245 --> 00:52:57,906
He's lost, this Texas Ranger.

459
00:52:58,914 --> 00:52:59,972
I don't think he's lost.

460
00:53:00,049 --> 00:53:01,243
Those banks have been offering
extra reward money for us...

461
00:53:01,584 --> 00:53:04,576
...and I think Frank just
figured on some easy pickings.

462
00:53:05,921 --> 00:53:07,411
You know, Texas Ranger, you
ain't hardly doing your job.

463
00:53:08,424 --> 00:53:10,187
You ought to be home
protecting the rights of poor folk...

464
00:53:10,259 --> 00:53:11,749
...not out chasing after us.

465
00:53:18,100 --> 00:53:19,931
Why do you want to take
it so personal for?

466
00:53:20,269 --> 00:53:24,262
We've got to discourage this bounty
hunting for the Barrow Gang.

467
00:53:27,443 --> 00:53:28,774
What do you want to do
with him then?

468
00:53:29,612 --> 00:53:30,601
Shoot him?

469
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:36,945
Hang him.

470
00:53:37,286 --> 00:53:39,447
Take his picture.

471
00:53:42,792 --> 00:53:44,453
Listen, we take his picture...

472
00:53:44,794 --> 00:53:46,284
...we'll send it to all the newspapers.

473
00:53:46,629 --> 00:53:48,620
And then everybody's going to
see Captain Frank Hamer...

474
00:53:48,798 --> 00:53:50,288
...of the Texas Rangers
with the Barrow Gang...

475
00:53:50,633 --> 00:53:52,965
...and all of us just
as friendly as pie.

476
00:53:53,969 --> 00:53:58,133
We are just about the friendliest
folks you'd ever want to meet.

477
00:53:58,808 --> 00:54:03,302
Big old Texas Ranger
waves his gun at us...

478
00:54:03,646 --> 00:54:07,138
...and we just welcome him
like he was one of our own.

479
00:54:08,818 --> 00:54:10,479
Buck, get the Kodak.

480
00:54:18,294 --> 00:54:20,990
See what came of your
mischief not doing your job?

481
00:54:21,664 --> 00:54:23,996
Down in Duncanville
last year...

482
00:54:24,333 --> 00:54:27,166
...poor farmers kept you laws
away from us with shotguns.

483
00:54:28,003 --> 00:54:29,061
Now you're supposed to be
protecting them from us...

484
00:54:29,205 --> 00:54:31,173
...and they're protecting us from you.

485
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,500
That don't make sense, do it?

486
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:44,175
When his Texas Ranger friends see
this, he's going to wish he was dead.

487
00:54:44,520 --> 00:54:46,852
I'm mighty proud to have a
Texas Ranger in the family.

488
00:54:50,526 --> 00:54:51,857
How's this?

489
00:55:26,729 --> 00:55:29,391
We're going to put that picture
in every paper in the country!

490
00:55:39,909 --> 00:55:43,242
We got you!
You just stay there for a while.

491
00:55:48,584 --> 00:55:49,573
We got you!

492
00:56:08,103 --> 00:56:10,594
Good afternoon.
This is the Barrow Gang.

493
00:56:11,774 --> 00:56:14,265
If everybody will just take
it easy, nobody will get hurt.

494
00:56:27,790 --> 00:56:28,950
Is that your money or the bank's?

495
00:56:29,458 --> 00:56:30,288
Mine.

496
00:56:30,793 --> 00:56:32,454
You keep it then.

497
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,123
Next time, I'll aim a
little lower.

498
00:57:01,323 --> 00:57:03,814
Take a good look, Pop.
I'm Buck Barrow.

499
00:57:06,996 --> 00:57:08,327
We're the Barrow boys.

500
00:57:15,170 --> 00:57:16,660
Happy birthday, hon.

501
00:57:30,352 --> 00:57:34,345
It was the Barrow Gang, Charlie.
They're headed for Oklahoma.

502
00:57:56,545 --> 00:57:57,534
Load this!

503
00:58:17,399 --> 00:58:20,732
There I was, staring square
into the face of death.

504
00:58:46,428 --> 00:58:49,920
And all I can say is
they did right by me.

505
00:58:50,766 --> 00:58:53,758
And I'm bringing me a mess
of flowers to their funeral.

506
00:59:22,631 --> 00:59:24,292
Slow down, we're in Oklahoma now!

507
00:59:27,970 --> 00:59:29,460
Come on, let's catch them, anyway.

508
00:59:31,807 --> 00:59:33,468
I'm not going to risk
my life in Oklahoma.

509
00:59:57,166 --> 00:59:58,292
Ain't much, is it?

510
00:59:58,667 --> 00:59:59,656
Well, times are hard.

511
01:00:01,803 --> 01:00:03,964
Let's get down to it.

512
01:00:18,987 --> 01:00:20,682
I want my share.

513
01:00:22,991 --> 01:00:25,323
If Bonnie gets a share,
I want a share, too.

514
01:00:25,694 --> 01:00:26,991
What are you talking about?

515
01:00:27,329 --> 01:00:28,489
Tell Clyde I want my share.

516
01:00:35,204 --> 01:00:36,193
What about Blanche here?

517
01:00:38,507 --> 01:00:39,496
Well, why not?

518
01:00:43,212 --> 01:00:46,204
I earn my share same
as everybody.

519
01:00:46,515 --> 01:00:48,449
I could have got killed
same as everybody,

520
01:00:48,517 --> 01:00:50,007
...and I'm wanted by the law
same as everybody.

521
01:00:50,852 --> 01:00:53,719
Besides I could have got snake-bit
sleeping in those woods every night.

522
01:00:54,356 --> 01:00:56,221
I'm a nervous wreck and
that's the truth...

523
01:00:57,859 --> 01:01:01,022
...and I have to take sass from
Miss Bonnie Parker all the time.

524
01:01:01,530 --> 01:01:02,360
I deserve mine!

525
01:01:02,731 --> 01:01:04,722
Hold on, Blanche, hold your horses,
you're going to get your share.

526
01:01:13,742 --> 01:01:17,041
I married the preacher's daughter and she
thinks she's still taking up a collection.

527
01:01:23,252 --> 01:01:25,243
Don't spend it
all in one place!

528
01:01:32,561 --> 01:01:35,052
I guess I'm going to have
to keep saying this...

529
01:01:35,764 --> 01:01:38,062
...Blanche is married to
Buck, and Buck is family.

530
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:41,062
My family could use some of that money.

531
01:01:41,403 --> 01:01:42,495
Now you know how those laws...

532
01:01:42,638 --> 01:01:43,935
...have been hanging around
your mama's house till all hours.

533
01:01:44,039 --> 01:01:45,028
It's too risky to go up there now.

534
01:01:45,574 --> 01:01:48,907
But where can we go now? We rob
the damn banks. What else do we do?

535
01:01:49,044 --> 01:01:50,443
What do you want to do?

536
01:01:50,612 --> 01:01:51,772
There's a hole in the pan.

537
01:01:52,281 --> 01:01:54,772
We're losing oil. We've got to swipe
another car if we want to get anywhere.

538
01:01:54,850 --> 01:01:56,112
C'mon and look.

539
01:02:22,811 --> 01:02:24,938
Isn't that your car, Eugene?

540
01:02:25,814 --> 01:02:27,111
That's my car!

541
01:02:32,954 --> 01:02:34,444
That's my car!

542
01:02:37,826 --> 01:02:38,918
That's my car.

543
01:02:55,844 --> 01:02:58,472
- They're coming after us!
- Come on, kick it in the pants.

544
01:02:58,847 --> 01:03:02,476
I'm going to tear them apart.
Those punks.

545
01:03:03,485 --> 01:03:04,975
Stealing a man's car.

546
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:08,854
Wait till I get my hands
on those kids, Velma.

547
01:03:09,358 --> 01:03:11,349
I'm going to tear them apart.

548
01:03:13,161 --> 01:03:15,152
What if they have guns, Eugene?

549
01:03:17,666 --> 01:03:20,157
Listen, we better get the police
and let them handle this.

550
01:03:22,170 --> 01:03:24,798
All right, now, turn around.
Turn around and let's go back to town.

551
01:03:24,873 --> 01:03:26,704
Then we'll go get the sheriff.

552
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:33,671
They stopped chasing us.
They're turning around there.

553
01:03:37,018 --> 01:03:38,383
Let's take them.

554
01:03:45,193 --> 01:03:47,388
Oh, my Lord, they're coming after us.

555
01:03:48,697 --> 01:03:50,187
Step on it, Velma.

556
01:03:56,204 --> 01:03:57,899
What do you want to do that for?

557
01:03:58,407 --> 01:04:01,535
Step on it, Velma. Step on it.

558
01:04:23,932 --> 01:04:25,729
What are you doing in there?

559
01:04:40,949 --> 01:04:43,076
All right, get on out of there.
Come on.

560
01:04:45,086 --> 01:04:46,747
You want to go for a
little ride in our new car?

561
01:04:48,590 --> 01:04:50,251
Can we all fit in there?

562
01:04:57,632 --> 01:04:59,463
There's not room for me in there.

563
01:05:12,814 --> 01:05:13,803
What's your names?

564
01:05:16,284 --> 01:05:19,481
I'm Eugene Griz- I'm Eugene Grizzard.

565
01:05:22,624 --> 01:05:24,114
We're the Barrow Gang.

566
01:05:29,297 --> 01:05:33,631
Now listen, now don't be scared.
It ain't like you was the law or anything.

567
01:05:34,002 --> 01:05:36,197
I mean, you're just folks,
just like us. That's all.

568
01:05:36,505 --> 01:05:38,803
That's the truth.

569
01:05:41,142 --> 01:05:42,632
I expect you've been
reading about us.

570
01:05:48,650 --> 01:05:49,639
We have, too.

571
01:05:51,152 --> 01:05:55,521
You two must
be in love, I bet.

572
01:06:00,328 --> 01:06:01,317
When are you going
to marry the girl?

573
01:06:11,840 --> 01:06:14,172
He gave her the milk, and
she drank a little bit of it.

574
01:06:14,543 --> 01:06:18,843
The next day, he gave her some more.
She drank some more till a week goes by.

575
01:06:19,180 --> 01:06:22,343
And he brings her the milk and she
drinks down every drop of it.

576
01:06:22,684 --> 01:06:24,845
And she looks at her son
and she calls him over and she says...

577
01:06:25,186 --> 01:06:29,179
"...Son, whatever you do,
don't sell that cow."

578
01:06:45,073 --> 01:06:48,736
I'm from Wisconsin originally.
Where the cheese comes from.

579
01:06:50,245 --> 01:06:53,578
Oh, but he just loves Texas now.
Don't you, Eugene?

580
01:06:53,915 --> 01:06:54,904
"Don't sell that cow."

581
01:06:57,919 --> 01:06:58,749
How old are you?

582
01:06:59,421 --> 01:07:00,410
I'm thirty-three.

583
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,773
Didn't I order some
French fries?

584
01:07:22,110 --> 01:07:23,941
You did. Here you are.

585
01:07:28,116 --> 01:07:31,279
Take it easy on those French fries.
Ain't that right, Eugene?

586
01:07:31,620 --> 01:07:33,281
This isn't mine.

587
01:07:33,955 --> 01:07:36,287
I ordered mine well done.
Who's got the other hamburger?

588
01:07:39,794 --> 01:07:41,284
Is this supposed to be yours?

589
01:07:45,634 --> 01:07:47,124
It's okay. Forget it.

590
01:07:48,637 --> 01:07:49,626
I'm sure having a good time.

591
01:07:52,140 --> 01:07:52,970
Aren't you glad we picked you up?

592
01:07:53,642 --> 01:07:55,303
You're a grand host, Buck.

593
01:07:55,977 --> 01:07:57,467
Maybe you all ought to join up with us.

594
01:08:01,816 --> 01:08:05,149
They sure would be surprised
to hear that back home.

595
01:08:05,820 --> 01:08:08,482
What would Bill and Martha
say if they heard that?

596
01:08:08,823 --> 01:08:11,314
Lordy, they would have a fit!

597
01:08:12,661 --> 01:08:14,492
What do you do, anyhow?

598
01:08:15,997 --> 01:08:17,328
I'm an undertaker.

599
01:08:22,504 --> 01:08:23,994
Get them out of here.

600
01:08:54,035 --> 01:08:55,525
I don't see her, Clyde.

601
01:08:56,705 --> 01:08:58,195
Bonnie, where are you?

602
01:09:10,719 --> 01:09:11,708
Where do you think she
could have went, Buck?

603
01:09:12,053 --> 01:09:15,045
I don't know. I just don't know.

604
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:22,719
There!

605
01:09:38,413 --> 01:09:39,903
Leave me alone!

606
01:09:40,248 --> 01:09:41,579
Where are you going?

607
01:09:41,916 --> 01:09:43,076
Get away!

608
01:09:49,257 --> 01:09:50,918
I want to see my mama.

609
01:09:52,093 --> 01:09:53,424
I want to see my mama.

610
01:09:53,928 --> 01:09:57,420
Please, honey, don't ever leave me
without saying nothing.

611
01:10:06,608 --> 01:10:09,600
Clyde, listen to me. Clyde, please.

612
01:10:10,278 --> 01:10:12,109
Now, listen. I mean it.

613
01:10:12,447 --> 01:10:14,779
I've been thinking about my mama...

614
01:10:15,784 --> 01:10:18,776
...and she's getting so old,
and I want to see her.

615
01:10:20,789 --> 01:10:21,778
You'll see her.

616
01:10:55,824 --> 01:10:57,485
Would you look at him?

617
01:10:59,828 --> 01:11:00,817
He just don't remember me.

618
01:11:03,665 --> 01:11:05,155
He'll get used to me, won't he?

619
01:11:06,501 --> 01:11:08,833
We've been cutting and pasting
everything we could find about you.

620
01:11:09,671 --> 01:11:11,662
Clyde, there's the shot I took of you.

621
01:11:12,340 --> 01:11:13,830
Came out real fine, didn't it?

622
01:11:49,377 --> 01:11:52,369
"Horsey, get your tail up.
Why don't you make it rise?"

623
01:11:54,215 --> 01:11:57,207
Oh, Lord, we thank you for
the safety of our loved ones.

624
01:11:58,052 --> 01:12:00,213
And the food we are
about to receive. Amen.

625
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:24,071
Where you all headed
to from here, Clyde?

626
01:12:24,412 --> 01:12:27,074
At this point we ain't heading to
nowhere. We're just running from.

627
01:12:41,095 --> 01:12:44,587
Mama, why don't you stay
a little longer.

628
01:12:46,434 --> 01:12:48,265
Listen, I want you to have this.

629
01:12:58,279 --> 01:13:00,270
Listen, make mama stay a while yet?

630
01:13:00,615 --> 01:13:04,608
Clyde, I read about
you all in the papers...

631
01:13:04,953 --> 01:13:08,116
...and I just get scared.

632
01:13:08,790 --> 01:13:12,282
Mrs. Parker, don't you believe what
you read in all those newspapers.

633
01:13:12,627 --> 01:13:13,958
That's the laws talking there.

634
01:13:14,295 --> 01:13:16,627
They want us to look big so they're
going to look big when they catch us.

635
01:13:17,465 --> 01:13:18,796
And they ain't going to catch us.

636
01:13:19,133 --> 01:13:20,964
Because I'm even better at running
than I am at robbing banks.

637
01:13:21,803 --> 01:13:24,271
If we did half that stuff they
say we did in those papers,

638
01:13:24,305 --> 01:13:25,294
...we'd be millionaires
by now, wouldn't we?

639
01:13:27,809 --> 01:13:30,300
I ain't going to risk my little
girl here just to make money,

640
01:13:30,478 --> 01:13:31,809
...uncertain as times are.

641
01:13:32,814 --> 01:13:34,145
I knew, of a job...

642
01:13:35,316 --> 01:13:36,908
You remember the time.
I could have...

643
01:13:36,985 --> 01:13:38,816
...we could have got $2,000
just as easy as pie.

644
01:13:40,154 --> 01:13:43,646
I pulled up outside there
and I saw them laws...

645
01:13:44,325 --> 01:13:47,158
...and I said to myself,
"Bonnie could get hurt here."

646
01:13:48,162 --> 01:13:50,653
So we just drove right on
and I let that money lay.

647
01:13:51,332 --> 01:13:52,993
Maybe you know the way with her, then.

648
01:13:53,334 --> 01:13:55,996
I'm just an old woman
and I don't know nothing.

649
01:13:56,671 --> 01:14:00,004
But Mrs. Parker, this here is the
way we know best how to make money.

650
01:14:00,341 --> 01:14:02,309
But we're going to be quitting all this
as soon as hard times are over,

651
01:14:02,343 --> 01:14:03,332
I can tell you that.

652
01:14:04,512 --> 01:14:06,673
Just the other night,
me and Bonnie were talking...

653
01:14:07,015 --> 01:14:09,848
about the time we were going
to settle down and get a home.

654
01:14:12,186 --> 01:14:16,179
She says, to me.
"You know, I couldn't bear...

655
01:14:16,858 --> 01:14:19,850
...to live more than 3 miles
from my precious mother."

656
01:14:20,695 --> 01:14:22,026
How do you like
that, Mother Parker?

657
01:14:23,031 --> 01:14:25,022
I don't believe I would.

658
01:14:28,703 --> 01:14:31,866
You try to live 3 miles from me
and you won't live long.

659
01:14:34,042 --> 01:14:36,704
You best keep running, Clyde Barrow.

660
01:14:37,211 --> 01:14:38,371
And you know it.

661
01:14:43,217 --> 01:14:44,548
Bye, baby.

662
01:15:10,311 --> 01:15:12,506
Look, who is this here,
is that your girlfriend?

663
01:15:14,582 --> 01:15:16,072
"L, o, v, e."

664
01:15:16,751 --> 01:15:18,742
Whose idea was
it to get bluebirds?

665
01:15:19,087 --> 01:15:21,578
Bonnie's. Bonnie picked it out.

666
01:15:22,924 --> 01:15:24,585
Day after we robbed the armory.

667
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,092
I want you to touch
something here. Ah...

668
01:15:29,931 --> 01:15:32,263
I want you just to
touch it right there.

669
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:42,273
Why don't you all go
into your own cabin...

670
01:15:42,610 --> 01:15:44,771
...if you want to play with C.W.?

671
01:15:45,113 --> 01:15:47,946
What's the matter with you now,
besides your nasty disposition?

672
01:15:50,785 --> 01:15:52,116
Wait now. Hold on!

673
01:15:54,789 --> 01:15:58,122
I saw a chicken place a few miles back.
Who all wants to get some food?

674
01:15:58,593 --> 01:16:00,788
I certainly do. I'm sick to
death of sitting around here.

675
01:16:01,129 --> 01:16:02,960
Why, you can't even
drive the car.

676
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:06,630
Just get us 5 chicken dinners.

677
01:16:09,637 --> 01:16:13,300
Get some dessert there, too. Some
peach ice cream or something.

678
01:16:38,666 --> 01:16:42,659
I've got the blues so bad.

679
01:16:53,014 --> 01:16:54,504
Is it what your mama said?

680
01:16:59,187 --> 01:17:00,848
What mama?

681
01:17:04,192 --> 01:17:06,023
She's just an old woman now.

682
01:17:08,196 --> 01:17:09,857
I don't have no mama.

683
01:17:13,367 --> 01:17:14,698
No family either.

684
01:17:18,539 --> 01:17:19,870
I'm your family.

685
01:17:36,057 --> 01:17:38,389
When we started out...

686
01:17:38,726 --> 01:17:41,559
...I thought we were
really going somewhere.

687
01:17:44,398 --> 01:17:45,729
But this is it.

688
01:17:48,903 --> 01:17:50,564
We're just going.

689
01:17:53,908 --> 01:17:55,068
I love you.

690
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:11,251
You sure are smoking a lot lately.

691
01:18:11,592 --> 01:18:12,422
So what?

692
01:18:21,102 --> 01:18:22,763
Why don't you go back
to your pa's house?

693
01:18:25,773 --> 01:18:26,933
If I only could.

694
01:18:28,276 --> 01:18:30,437
If I could only just do that one thing.

695
01:18:33,447 --> 01:18:35,608
There's no telling
how all this happened.

696
01:18:36,951 --> 01:18:38,782
I was a preacher's daughter.

697
01:18:41,122 --> 01:18:43,113
What church was your pa affiliated with?

698
01:18:43,457 --> 01:18:44,287
Baptist.

699
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:55,291
He thought the world
of Buck, my daddy did.

700
01:18:56,137 --> 01:18:58,628
Even though Buck was
serving time in jail.

701
01:19:01,309 --> 01:19:04,472
He forgave him because he
paid his debt to society.

702
01:19:07,148 --> 01:19:08,809
We were Disciples of Christ.

703
01:19:20,328 --> 01:19:22,489
I have no money.
Give me some.

704
01:19:43,684 --> 01:19:45,174
Get me Sheriff Smoot on the phone.

705
01:19:47,855 --> 01:19:50,016
"I love to spend...

706
01:19:51,359 --> 01:19:53,691
"...each Sunday with you.

707
01:19:54,195 --> 01:19:55,856
"As friend to friend...

708
01:19:57,365 --> 01:19:59,856
"...l'm sorry it's through."

709
01:20:02,703 --> 01:20:04,364
That's more like it.

710
01:20:04,872 --> 01:20:06,703
Look how much better it
fits since I took it up.

711
01:20:16,384 --> 01:20:17,715
The men are on the other side.

712
01:21:34,628 --> 01:21:35,617
Hold it, hold it!

713
01:21:35,963 --> 01:21:36,952
Get out!

714
01:22:49,203 --> 01:22:51,535
Give me a gun! Somebody, give
me a gun. I don't have a gun.

715
01:22:56,877 --> 01:22:59,869
Be quiet! Please, be quiet!
We're trying to get out.

716
01:23:25,906 --> 01:23:28,898
It didn't happen, Daddy.
I know it.

717
01:23:31,078 --> 01:23:32,238
Stop that!

718
01:23:52,266 --> 01:23:54,598
I'd rather go to jail,
than go on like this.

719
01:23:57,438 --> 01:23:59,599
He ain't got a chance.
Half his head's blown off.

720
01:24:03,777 --> 01:24:07,269
Dear Lord, it's happened.
Please help us.

721
01:24:08,282 --> 01:24:11,274
And Buck will never do anything
wrong again in his life.

722
01:24:15,289 --> 01:24:16,950
My eyes.

723
01:24:18,292 --> 01:24:20,123
I think I'm blind!

724
01:24:20,628 --> 01:24:22,118
My eyes!

725
01:24:23,130 --> 01:24:24,791
The light hurts so bad!

726
01:24:32,973 --> 01:24:34,634
Tell Clyde to get us to a doctor.

727
01:24:35,476 --> 01:24:37,467
Bonnie! We're dying!

728
01:24:37,978 --> 01:24:40,310
Buck can't be moved now.

729
01:24:47,988 --> 01:24:49,819
I believe I lost my shoes, Clyde.

730
01:24:51,659 --> 01:24:53,320
I think the dog got them.

731
01:25:29,363 --> 01:25:30,022
Surrender!

732
01:25:31,031 --> 01:25:32,362
In the car! Come on!

733
01:25:35,703 --> 01:25:36,692
Keep low!

734
01:26:02,896 --> 01:26:06,059
Cross fire! Keep low!

735
01:26:23,751 --> 01:26:26,743
Charlie, don't shoot!
The kids are in the cross fire!

736
01:26:27,087 --> 01:26:29,078
I'll go get the car.

737
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:31,079
Hey, Buck, this way.

738
01:26:33,927 --> 01:26:37,920
They're heading for the other car!
Shoot it! Knock the hell out of it!

739
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:02,255
Hold your fire!

740
01:27:03,123 --> 01:27:04,454
Daddy, don't die!

741
01:27:08,295 --> 01:27:11,958
Get away and leave him alone.
He's dying. Can't you see he's dying?

742
01:27:12,299 --> 01:27:13,789
Let me go! Daddy!

743
01:27:14,134 --> 01:27:18,298
You've killed him! He's dying!
God, can't you see him dying?

744
01:28:15,863 --> 01:28:16,852
Maybe...

745
01:30:02,469 --> 01:30:05,802
Can you all spare us
some drinking water?

746
01:30:06,306 --> 01:30:07,295
Who are you, boy?

747
01:30:07,808 --> 01:30:09,139
My name is Moss.

748
01:30:47,681 --> 01:30:49,512
That's Clyde Barrow and Bonnie Parker.

749
01:30:49,850 --> 01:30:51,181
What happened to them?

750
01:30:55,355 --> 01:30:56,344
Are they fainting?

751
01:31:17,044 --> 01:31:18,875
Is that really Bonnie Parker?

752
01:31:51,244 --> 01:31:52,233
Daddy, daddy!

753
01:31:54,915 --> 01:31:56,405
- Who's there?
- C.W.

754
01:31:59,252 --> 01:32:02,085
Oh, it's good to see you, boy.
It's good to see you.

755
01:32:02,422 --> 01:32:03,753
What's that on your chest, there?

756
01:32:04,091 --> 01:32:04,921
Tattoo, daddy. Come on.

757
01:32:07,594 --> 01:32:08,583
You've got to help them.

758
01:32:11,264 --> 01:32:12,424
Help me get them in.

759
01:32:14,101 --> 01:32:16,592
What happened to them?
Are you in trouble, son?

760
01:32:21,374 --> 01:32:22,602
Help me get 'em in.

761
01:32:32,953 --> 01:32:35,444
How come you marked yourself
all up with that tattoo?

762
01:32:36,623 --> 01:32:38,955
What the hell made you do a
damn fool thing like that?

763
01:32:54,808 --> 01:32:56,799
I came here to question Blanche Barrow.

764
01:32:57,477 --> 01:32:58,466
So you're the Frank Hammer?

765
01:33:02,482 --> 01:33:05,144
Hamer. I figure to have my picture
taken with those two...

766
01:33:05,485 --> 01:33:07,316
...just one more time.

767
01:33:07,988 --> 01:33:10,923
It says here: "Clyde fled
his dying brother."

768
01:33:10,991 --> 01:33:12,151
Where? What do they mean "fled"?

769
01:33:12,826 --> 01:33:16,318
How could I leave my brother to die, when
he was already dead when I left him?

770
01:33:17,330 --> 01:33:18,490
Fled!

771
01:33:20,000 --> 01:33:20,989
Newspapers!

772
01:33:22,169 --> 01:33:24,160
While we're all lying
around here near dead,

773
01:33:24,204 --> 01:33:26,502
...they had us holding up the
Grand Prairie National Bank.

774
01:33:27,007 --> 01:33:28,497
Guess they hung that
one on us just for luck.

775
01:33:30,343 --> 01:33:34,336
As soon as we get well, we're going to
hold up that bank. We're going to take it.

776
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:49,521
They don't know nothing, do they?

777
01:33:50,864 --> 01:33:52,855
How come they always referring
to me, the newspapers as...

778
01:33:53,200 --> 01:33:56,692
...unidentified suspect?

779
01:33:57,037 --> 01:33:58,527
You just be glad that's all you are.

780
01:33:58,872 --> 01:34:00,362
Long as they don't know your last name.

781
01:34:00,707 --> 01:34:04,199
That's right, boy. Mr. Barrow's
looking out for your interests.

782
01:34:07,547 --> 01:34:08,536
Hey, pa.

783
01:34:09,382 --> 01:34:12,545
How's it feel to have a couple of
big deals stay in your house?

784
01:34:12,886 --> 01:34:14,547
Ain't that something for me.
That's something for me?

785
01:34:14,888 --> 01:34:16,549
You've been mighty nice to us.

786
01:34:17,390 --> 01:34:22,054
I want you to let us pay you,
say, $40 for your hospitality.

787
01:34:25,398 --> 01:34:26,888
I'm just happy to have
you folks here as company.

788
01:34:28,068 --> 01:34:29,899
Anybody's a friend of
my boy, you know I...

789
01:34:30,237 --> 01:34:32,068
Come on, let's go have some supper.
I'm starving. Come on.

790
01:34:34,574 --> 01:34:36,565
You're all welcome here.
You know that.

791
01:34:38,411 --> 01:34:41,744
And you just make yourself right at
home and stay as long as you want to.

792
01:34:51,258 --> 01:34:53,089
You look like trash,
all marked up like that.

793
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:56,417
Cheap trash!

794
01:34:59,099 --> 01:35:00,589
Bonnie says it looks good.

795
01:35:02,269 --> 01:35:05,102
What does Bonnie know? She ain't
nothing but cheap trash herself.

796
01:35:05,438 --> 01:35:07,929
Look what they do to you. You don't
ever get your name in the paper.

797
01:35:08,608 --> 01:35:11,270
You just get them pictures printed
on your skin by Bonnie and Clyde.

798
01:35:11,611 --> 01:35:13,772
They ain't nothing
but a couple of kids.

799
01:35:16,449 --> 01:35:19,441
I'm so glad your ma ain't alive
to see this here thing...

800
01:35:22,289 --> 01:35:23,779
...all jellied up like that!

801
01:35:25,959 --> 01:35:29,122
I don't see what's so bad about it.

802
01:35:30,797 --> 01:35:31,627
You wouldn't!

803
01:35:37,304 --> 01:35:40,796
The word is out that Bonnie and
Clyde are holed up just out of town.

804
01:35:41,308 --> 01:35:44,141
And they're fixing to bust in
here and take Blanche out.

805
01:35:45,779 --> 01:35:47,303
All two of them?

806
01:36:11,504 --> 01:36:12,493
Who is it?

807
01:36:23,016 --> 01:36:26,850
I guess it's been kind of
rough on you.

808
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:32,852
Being the daughter of a
preacher, like you are.

809
01:36:44,871 --> 01:36:48,534
I imagine old Buck wasn't
a bad sort, was he?

810
01:36:49,209 --> 01:36:50,369
No, he wasn't.

811
01:36:52,212 --> 01:36:53,201
I reckon...

812
01:36:54,881 --> 01:36:56,371
...Clyde just sort of...

813
01:36:57,884 --> 01:36:59,715
...led him astray, didn't he?

814
01:37:09,896 --> 01:37:11,887
That's a shame, Blanche.

815
01:37:16,569 --> 01:37:18,400
Yes, ma'am.

816
01:37:20,140 --> 01:37:20,902
That's a shame.

817
01:37:21,741 --> 01:37:24,073
That he led your Buck away.

818
01:37:25,078 --> 01:37:27,239
Clyde, his own brother, Bonnie...

819
01:37:30,750 --> 01:37:31,910
And that little feller.

820
01:37:33,920 --> 01:37:37,253
The one that was with you when you
took that Texas Ranger in Missouri.

821
01:37:41,094 --> 01:37:43,255
He was with you all along, wasn't he?

822
01:37:51,104 --> 01:37:52,264
That's right.

823
01:37:59,446 --> 01:38:01,437
I don't recollect his last name.

824
01:38:08,455 --> 01:38:10,116
He was there that day we met them.

825
01:38:10,457 --> 01:38:13,449
I didn't want to go. I didn't want to.

826
01:38:14,627 --> 01:38:18,119
And Buck said we were just
going on a visit...

827
01:38:18,631 --> 01:38:21,293
...so we wouldn't do no
stealing or robbing.

828
01:38:23,636 --> 01:38:26,127
And we went up to Joplin,
and all of a sudden...

829
01:38:27,474 --> 01:38:30,637
...all of a sudden, they
all just started shooting.

830
01:38:41,154 --> 01:38:42,143
What're you writing?

831
01:38:43,323 --> 01:38:45,655
I'm writing a poem about us.

832
01:38:47,160 --> 01:38:48,149
Let me hear it.

833
01:38:51,164 --> 01:38:52,495
Just let me finish this line.

834
01:38:57,504 --> 01:38:59,665
It's called "The Story
of Bonnie and Clyde."

835
01:39:00,507 --> 01:39:04,500
"You've heard the story of Jesse
James, of how he lived and died.

836
01:39:05,178 --> 01:39:07,840
"If you're still in need
of something to read...

837
01:39:08,181 --> 01:39:10,012
"...here's the story
of Bonnie and Clyde."

838
01:39:11,351 --> 01:39:13,842
You think if I sent that into
the newspaper, they'd print it?

839
01:39:16,356 --> 01:39:17,516
I'm going to do it.

840
01:39:18,858 --> 01:39:21,349
"Now Bonnie and Clyde
are the Barrow Gang.

841
01:39:21,694 --> 01:39:25,027
"I'm sure you all have read
how they rob and steal...

842
01:39:25,365 --> 01:39:28,198
"...and those who squeal are
usually found dying or dead.

843
01:39:29,369 --> 01:39:31,200
"They call them cold-hearted killers.

844
01:39:33,373 --> 01:39:35,534
"They say they are heartless and mean.

845
01:39:36,042 --> 01:39:39,876
"But I say this with pride,
that I once knew Clyde...

846
01:39:40,213 --> 01:39:42,875
"...when he was honest
and upright and clean.

847
01:39:43,383 --> 01:39:46,375
"But the laws fooled around,
kept taking him down...

848
01:39:46,719 --> 01:39:48,380
"...and locking him up in a cell.

849
01:39:49,055 --> 01:39:53,549
"Till he said to me, 'I'll never be free,
so I'll meet a few of them in hell.'

850
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:58,891
"If a policeman is killed in Dallas,
and they have no clue to guide.

851
01:39:59,399 --> 01:40:02,562
"If they can't find a fiend,
they just wipe their slate clean...

852
01:40:03,069 --> 01:40:05,060
"...and hang it on Bonnie and Clyde.

853
01:40:05,905 --> 01:40:08,066
"If they try to act like citizens...

854
01:40:08,575 --> 01:40:10,907
"...and rent them a nice little flat...

855
01:40:11,411 --> 01:40:14,574
"...about the third night,
they're invited to fight...

856
01:40:14,914 --> 01:40:16,575
"...by a sub-gun's rat-a-tat-tat.

857
01:40:17,750 --> 01:40:19,911
"Someday they'll go down together.

858
01:40:20,086 --> 01:40:21,747
"They'll bury them side by side.

859
01:40:22,255 --> 01:40:23,745
"To few it will be grief...

860
01:40:24,090 --> 01:40:25,580
"...to the law a relief...

861
01:40:25,758 --> 01:40:27,749
"...but it's death
for Bonnie and Clyde."

862
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,091
You know what you've done there?
You told my story.

863
01:40:37,937 --> 01:40:39,427
You told my whole story right there.

864
01:40:42,609 --> 01:40:44,975
One time I told you I was gonna
make you somebody.

865
01:40:45,044 --> 01:40:45,772
That's what you've done for me.

866
01:40:47,113 --> 01:40:49,104
You made me somebody
they're going to remember.

867
01:42:27,046 --> 01:42:28,707
Hey, Bonnie, how do you feel?

868
01:42:29,382 --> 01:42:31,145
I mean, do you feel the way
you're supposed to feel...

869
01:42:31,284 --> 01:42:32,615
...when you're, when you're,
after you're...

870
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:33,708
Yeah, just...

871
01:42:35,221 --> 01:42:37,883
That's good, isn't it?

872
01:42:39,559 --> 01:42:42,722
I figure that it's
a good idea to ask...

873
01:42:43,229 --> 01:42:44,389
...because how else are
you going to know if it...

874
01:42:47,233 --> 01:42:48,894
You did just perfect.

875
01:42:52,739 --> 01:42:54,070
I did, didn't I?

876
01:42:57,076 --> 01:42:58,407
I mean, I really did.

877
01:43:00,246 --> 01:43:02,407
I never figured on that.

878
01:43:05,418 --> 01:43:08,251
Clyde, why do you want to marry me?

879
01:43:11,758 --> 01:43:13,589
To make an honest woman out of you.

880
01:43:18,765 --> 01:43:20,096
What would you do...

881
01:43:21,100 --> 01:43:25,264
...what would you do if
some miracle happened...

882
01:43:27,106 --> 01:43:30,598
...and we could walk out of
here tomorrow morning...

883
01:43:30,943 --> 01:43:33,935
...and start all over again. Clean.

884
01:43:34,781 --> 01:43:38,114
With no record and nobody after us?

885
01:43:51,130 --> 01:43:52,791
I guess I'd do it all different.

886
01:43:56,803 --> 01:43:57,792
First off...

887
01:43:59,472 --> 01:44:02,134
...I wouldn't live in the same
state where we pull our jobs.

888
01:44:02,475 --> 01:44:05,638
We'd live in another state
and stay clean there.

889
01:44:05,978 --> 01:44:07,969
Then when we wanted to take a
bank, we'd go into the other state.

890
01:44:33,840 --> 01:44:36,502
Did they expect you to go
downtown with them tomorrow?

891
01:44:36,609 --> 01:44:37,598
Who?

892
01:44:38,177 --> 01:44:39,667
Bonnie and Clyde, that's who.

893
01:44:40,012 --> 01:44:41,343
Sure. Always go with them.

894
01:44:47,520 --> 01:44:50,011
You better go.

895
01:44:52,358 --> 01:44:55,020
But when they go to get in their
car to come on home,

896
01:44:55,361 --> 01:44:56,828
...don't you get back in there with them.

897
01:44:56,863 --> 01:44:57,852
Why, daddy?

898
01:44:58,030 --> 01:45:00,191
You listen to your pa for once,
can't you do that?

899
01:45:00,366 --> 01:45:02,527
I'm your pa. I'm your kin.
Not that there Clyde Barrow.

900
01:45:04,704 --> 01:45:07,195
What do you want me to tell them,
"I can't get back in the car with you?"

901
01:45:07,707 --> 01:45:09,368
You tell them nothing.

902
01:45:13,045 --> 01:45:15,707
I made a deal and got you
off with a couple of years.

903
01:45:17,049 --> 01:45:19,882
You just be sure that you're
off the streets in that town...

904
01:45:20,219 --> 01:45:22,050
...when they go to get in their car.

905
01:45:22,722 --> 01:45:24,713
You think laws is going to
catch Bonnie and Clyde in town?

906
01:45:25,558 --> 01:45:26,889
Clyde's got a sense.

907
01:45:27,226 --> 01:45:28,557
Don't you know that, daddy?

908
01:45:29,562 --> 01:45:32,895
Nobody catches Clyde. Never.

909
01:45:36,068 --> 01:45:37,057
Never!

910
01:46:08,267 --> 01:46:09,427
What happened to C.W.?

911
01:46:09,936 --> 01:46:13,269
He's over there in the hardware store,
getting some light bulbs for his daddy.

912
01:46:21,948 --> 01:46:23,279
You going to wear them like that?

913
01:46:23,783 --> 01:46:25,273
Drive with one eye closed.

914
01:46:27,286 --> 01:46:28,617
Want some ice cream?

915
01:46:29,288 --> 01:46:32,121
Look here. Isn't that just the
prettiest thing you ever saw?

916
01:46:32,458 --> 01:46:35,621
Look, you can see every fingernail
of her hand.

917
01:46:35,962 --> 01:46:37,623
That's the prettiest thing.
Where is that boy?

918
01:46:39,131 --> 01:46:40,120
Listen, I'll go get him.

919
01:47:13,833 --> 01:47:14,822
Gladys Jean!

920
01:47:15,668 --> 01:47:16,657
Time to go home now.

921
01:47:53,706 --> 01:47:56,038
Get back there in about 20
minutes and we'll pick him up.

922
01:47:59,045 --> 01:48:01,707
If that boy didn't have his head
strapped on him, he'd lose it.

923
01:48:29,408 --> 01:48:31,399
Isn't that Malcolm there?

924
01:48:52,598 --> 01:48:54,088
Got a flat tire. Ain't got no spare.

925
01:50:49,712 --> 01:50:59,711
