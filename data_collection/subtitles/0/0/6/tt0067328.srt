1
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,872
President Truman'll be here tomorrow,
so you folks in Dallas turn out.

2
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,038
This is a Cowboy Rhythms
on KTRN, Wichita Falls.

3
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:28,551
Here's Hank Williams' hit tune,
"Cold, Cold Heart."

4
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,831
You ain't ever gonna
amount to nothing.

5
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:39,789
Already spent a dime this morning,
ain't even had breakfast.

6
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,279
Give me the chalk.

7
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:50,910
Why don't you comb your hair, Sonny?
lt sticks up.

8
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,030
l'm surprised
you had the nerve to show up...

9
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:05,436
...after that stomping
you took last night.

10
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:07,950
What'd you say?

11
00:03:09,520 --> 00:03:10,270
Could've been worse.

12
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,990
You can say that
about nearly everything.

13
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,268
Afew football teams had
some luck with tackling.

14
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,830
Keeps the other team
from scoring so often.

15
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:25,917
Sounds too rough for me.

16
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:35,596
You don't even care
if it was your last game.

17
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:39,236
You'll never get stomped
for your high school ball team again.

18
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:42,199
Where's your school spirit?
Don't know.

19
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,035
You working today?

20
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,998
The truck's being greased.

21
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,999
See, this is what l get for betting
on my own hometown ball team.

22
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,957
l oughtto have better sense.

23
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,509
Wouldn't hurt if you had
a better hometown.

24
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:24,789
You mind pointing that
at the floor till l get by?

25
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:27,275
l don't want my eye poked out.

26
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:32,635
Don't let Billy get too far away.

27
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:39,197
You're damn more dangerous in
a pool hall than on a football feld.

28
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:45,271
You ever heard of tackling?

29
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:02,956
Hey, Duane!

30
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:05,629
Boy, l froze my ass last night!

31
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,030
Why can't you kids learn to tackle?

32
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,354
How about taking Genevieve some
change,
as you're going that way?

33
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,513
Toss me one!

34
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:41,799
Look, Larry, they can catch.

35
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:44,918
Feisty sons of bitches.
Wish they could tackle.

36
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,031
Or do something useful.

37
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:50,477
Team wasn't worth
a kiss my ass this year.

38
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,190
Fade out, Crawford. One more time.

39
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,150
All right, you boys. Cut it out.

40
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,034
l got enough problems without you
playing that game again.

41
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,231
We could've run off
to Mexico with this.

42
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,035
Play the new one we heard.
Which one?

43
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,352
Down payment on breakfast. Let
somebody
prosperous play the jukebox.

44
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:23,750
Nobody prosperous would eat here.

45
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:32,315
l ain't very hungry.
Well, l am.

46
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,238
You want the pickup frst tonight?

47
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:36,436
l oughtn't get it fiirst
every Saturday. lt's half yours.

48
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,193
Go ahead.
You sure?

49
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:41,119
I'm sure. Anyways, I got
lots of deliveries to make.

50
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,356
And l have to go clear to Ranger.

51
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,393
l'll be lucky to get back
for the second show.

52
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,236
My goodness, Sonny.

53
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,471
Frank oughtn't work you
so late on weekends.

54
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:34,954
That's what l tell him.

55
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:38,391
You ain't got in in time
to see the comedy in three weeks.

56
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:41,313
Hope you don't want popcorn,
because there ain't none.

57
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,551
And you missed the newsreel too.

58
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:47,435
The main show's done started,
so l'll just charge you 30 cents.

59
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,510
Thanks, Miss Mosey.

60
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,634
l was wondering if my daughter had
deserted us, when l heard her voice.

61
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,833
Kay was our only daughter.

62
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,959
Afather's not supposed to have
favourites, but when it's Kay....

63
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,674
You smell good.
You like it?

64
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:07,714
What's that?
An atomizer.

65
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,433
What'd you get?
A present?

66
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,789
Who from?

67
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:12,915
Somebody.

68
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:21,194
l decided you had a wreck.

69
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,990
What's happened?
You look different.

70
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,628
l do?

71
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,072
You look all lit up inside.

72
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:36,835
You're not wearing
your usual deadpan look.

73
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:39,429
That "How'd l get
into this family?" look.

74
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,755
Father.

75
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,639
You've been taking those vitamins
Dr. Gray sent you.

76
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,154
That's right.

77
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:01,273
l guess l'll get me
some of those vitamins.

78
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,239
l'll get it, Delilah.

79
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:07,950
What's the matter?
She looks kind of queer.

80
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,193
Guess what?

81
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:14,397
lt's our anniversary.

82
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,917
We've been going steady
a year tonight.

83
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,197
Seems like a lot longer.

84
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:29,033
You should've got me
some anniversary present.

85
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:31,993
You can have another stick of gum.
That's all l got.

86
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,395
You can give me a dollar.

87
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:36,240
That's how much it cost me
and Marlene for the show.

88
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:39,193
What are y'all doing
back here in the dark?

89
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:42,834
He's coming for me soon.

90
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:44,633
l'll get your coffee.

91
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:50,000
Where'd the boys go?
Ben had some date.

92
00:09:50,280 --> 00:09:51,793
Tommy went for basketball practice.

93
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,399
l don't see why they should get
the pickup frst all the time.

94
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,714
All they ever want to do
is neck anyway.

95
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,114
Need some help, Jessie?
Yeah, sure do.

96
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,357
So long, Sam.
Bye.

97
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:23,517
Sure did like the picture.
Well, good.

98
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,235
l hope you ain't down
in the mouth about Charlene.

99
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,155
l ain't blue about her.
What are you blue about then?

100
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:34,630
Ain't nobody to go with in this town.

101
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,718
Jacy's the only pretty girl in school
and Duane's got her.

102
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,275
l'd call that his tough luck.

103
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,474
You don't have to eat so fast.
You ain't in a race.

104
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:47,151
Jacy'd bring you more misery
than she'll ever be worth.

105
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,638
Did your dad give you this?

106
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,872
He needs all he's got.

107
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:58,073
Wouldn't hurt you to take something
from him once in a while.

108
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,392
l don't know. You and Duane
both in a boarding house.

109
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:05,156
Him with the mother and you
with the father. Don't seem right.

110
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,198
And your dad's taking
too many pills, you know.

111
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:12,469
But l'm no one to talk.

112
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:14,876
l never did get on with Mama.
l still don't.

113
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:17,429
l hear Dan's going back
to work soon.

114
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:19,796
l guess you'll be quitting
before long.

115
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,829
We got $4000 worth
of doctor bills to pay.

116
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,514
l will probably be making
cheeseburgers for your grandkids.

117
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,870
l wonder what my chances are
of interesting you kids in John Keats.

118
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,309
None at all.

119
00:13:19,480 --> 00:13:20,833
Joe Bob?

120
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,674
l read that poem of his
about the nightingale.

121
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,399
l didn'tthink it was so good.

122
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:28,359
Sounded like he wanted
to be a nightingale.

123
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:32,355
l don't think he wanted
to be a nightingale.

124
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:34,631
Maybe he just wanted to be immortal.

125
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,435
All you have to do to be immortal
is lead a good Christian life.

126
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:41,029
Anyone can do it
if they love the Lord.

127
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,954
Well, maybe so, Joe Bob.

128
00:13:44,360 --> 00:13:46,351
Let me read you this...

129
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,196
..."When old age
shall this generation waste...

130
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:55,553
...thou shalt remain
in midst of other woe than ours...

131
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:59,879
...a friend to man,
to whom thou say'st:

132
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:03,357
'Beauty is truth,
truth beauty'

133
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:06,108
That is all ye know on earth...

134
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,958
...and all ye need to know."

135
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,237
Run, you little pissants, run!

136
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:14,229
Tough it out!
You gotta be men like the rest of us.

137
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,232
Ain't none of you pretty enough
to be women.

138
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:17,669
Here, Joe Bob.

139
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,679
Quit flapping your arms.
You look like a goddamn goose.

140
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,629
Even for a preacher's boy,
you ought to be in better shape.

141
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:25,836
What kind of female
will you ever get?

142
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:28,029
Tough it out!

143
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,998
Run, you little pissants.

144
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,476
All right, off the court.

145
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:40,789
lf you all didn't jack off so much,
maybe you could stay in shape.

146
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,598
Come here a minute, Sonny.

147
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,348
You do me a favour
and l'll do you one.

148
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:49,959
Sure, coach.

149
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,988
My old lady's got to go
to the doctor tomorrow.

150
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,878
You know women.
Always something wrong.

151
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,519
Yeah, l guess.

152
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:03,078
Take it from me. Anyway, l don't
have time to drive her.

153
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:07,433
Now, if you'll do this for me,
l'll get you out of civics class.

154
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:10,553
l'll be glad to.
That's the best offer l've had all day.

155
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,995
Tell her you got to get back
for practice...

156
00:15:13,240 --> 00:15:14,878
...so she won't stay too long.

157
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:17,230
l've got enough bills to pay already.

158
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,232
"Know what the trouble is with you?

159
00:15:23,520 --> 00:15:26,239
You ain't got no school spirit."

160
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:31,676
Anarene High School, we love you

161
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:33,916
Love you ever so grand

162
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,430
We will always be so loyal

163
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,036
Loyal to a man

164
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:45,676
Anarene, defeat or victory

165
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:49,157
We will always be true

166
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,796
Anarene High School, we love you

167
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,589
And we'll fght for you

168
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,318
You need a haircut.

169
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:21,079
Come on, Jimmie Sue.
We're hungry over here too.

170
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:24,278
l'm coming. Hold your horses!

171
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,988
Better watch it.
Here comes your mama.

172
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,916
Jacy, we're having supper
at home tonight.

173
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:46,509
l expect you there
in 15 minutes, you hear?

174
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,837
Okay, Mama.
l wasjust giving the boys a ride.

175
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:13,680
Here's a tune that's been
on the hit list for some weeks.

176
00:17:13,680 --> 00:17:16,148
Here's a tune that's been
on the hit list for some weeks.

177
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,429
Tell us the name.

178
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:20,076
Are a coming
Their sails are in sight

179
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,435
What is it?

180
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,750
"Shrimp Boats."
You got it!

181
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:30,870
Very good, Thomas.
You were in on that too.

182
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,270
There's $120.
We're going along fiine.

183
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,795
Now we come to City Limits.
This is

184
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:49,713
Guess you hate me tonight?

185
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:53,669
l love you, but l love Duane too.
Even if you don't like it.

186
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:56,798
l don't care. l'd just hate
to see you marry him.

187
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,792
You wouldn't be rich anymore.

188
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:00,672
l don't care about money.

189
00:18:00,920 --> 00:18:02,239
You're pretty stupid then.

190
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:05,830
You married Daddy when he was poor,
and he got rich, didn't he?

191
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,628
Scared your daddy
into getting rich, beautiful.

192
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,438
lf Daddy could do it,
Duane could too.

193
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:14,108
Not married to you.
You're not scary enough.

194
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:17,233
You're rich and miserable.
l don't want to be like you.

195
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,033
Not much danger of that.

196
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,314
You slept with him?

197
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:25,678
Go to the doctor sometime
and arrange something...

198
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:28,918
...so you don't have to worry
about babies.

199
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,795
But it's a sin unless you're married.
You know l wouldn't do that.

200
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:34,953
Don't be so mealy mouthed!

201
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,798
l thought if you slept with him...

202
00:18:37,040 --> 00:18:39,679
...you mightfiind out there isn't
anything magic about him.

203
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:41,831
Then we can send you
to a good school

204
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:43,473
l don't want to leave.

205
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,314
Why can't l stay and go
to college in Wichita Falls?

206
00:18:46,600 --> 00:18:47,715
Because.

207
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,798
Everything is flat and empty here.

208
00:18:51,080 --> 00:18:52,559
And nothing to do!

209
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,114
Can l have some of that?

210
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,436
Help yourself.
Don't you have any?

211
00:18:56,680 --> 00:18:59,911
Yeah, but l feel like
smelling good right now.

212
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:03,960
Don't you ever feel like
doing anything right now?

213
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:10,871
You oughtto leave your face
just like that.

214
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,116
All you need is
a little eyebrow pencil.

215
00:19:20,040 --> 00:19:21,519
Okay. Good night.

216
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:29,471
Just remember, beautiful, everything
gets old if you do it often enough.

217
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:33,554
So if you want to fnd out about
monotony real quick, marry Duane.

218
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,829
Hello.

219
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,469
Abilene, you asleep?
No.

220
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,278
Feel like company?

221
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,796
l thought l'd drive out,
see how my well is coming.

222
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:26,436
Drill hard.
You're better at oil wells anyway.

223
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:05,438
Hello, Sonny.
What you want?

224
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,034
Coach said you need a driver.

225
00:21:11,160 --> 00:21:12,388
Didn't he tell you?

226
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:16,595
No, he didn't mention it.
l thought he'd drive me himself.

227
00:21:16,920 --> 00:21:18,797
l guess he just couldn't get off.

228
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,111
Let me just get the radio.

229
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,188
ls it something bad?

230
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,070
No.

231
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,953
lt's something very....

232
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:40,315
Thank you.

233
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,593
Here's the keys.

234
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,033
l guess l'd better
be getting back to school.

235
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,431
lt was nice of you to drive me.

236
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,439
Well, it beats sitting
through civics, ma'am.

237
00:23:12,480 --> 00:23:15,472
Wouldn't you like to come in
and have a soda?

238
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:18,035
lf you can stand me
for a few more minutes.

239
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,993
l hate these northers.

240
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,476
Would you prefer milk?
Sit at the table.

241
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:49,151
Or you can go now if you want.

242
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,955
l was just scared to be alone.
l'm sorry l made you come in.

243
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,512
l'll take a Dr Pepper.

244
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:50,676
You'll never forgive me, l know.

245
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,358
Go on. You don't have to
stay any longer.

246
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,230
Thank you for the Dr Pepper.

247
00:24:59,600 --> 00:25:02,273
l guess you'll be glad
when basketball season's over.

248
00:25:03,640 --> 00:25:04,959
Why?

249
00:25:05,640 --> 00:25:07,790
Coach probably don't get
to stay home much...

250
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:10,275
...during football
and basketball season.

251
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:15,511
My God, you don't know a thing
about it, do you?

252
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,116
You better go on
to basketball practice.

253
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,591
Thanks for the Dr Pepper.

254
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,274
Hi, Jacy.

255
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,639
Duane coming?

256
00:26:12,280 --> 00:26:16,512
You know Bobby Sheen at Wichita Falls?
l met him at the country club.

257
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:19,673
He's having this midnight
swimming party tonight.

258
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:22,190
You wanna run over there with me?
l can't.

259
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,032
You heard about the last one.

260
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,477
His folks were gone to Miami,
and everybody swam naked.

261
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:30,479
His folks are gone again,
so it'll be pretty wild.

262
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,473
Sure wish you could come.
Bobby has great parties.

263
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,877
A lot of kids from the club
gonna be there.

264
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,671
Gee, Lester, l'd like to go.

265
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:46,314
l'll have a big problem
with Duane though.

266
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:49,673
Well, don't go off without me.
Maybe l can.

267
00:26:57,080 --> 00:26:57,876
Hi, Duane.

268
00:26:58,160 --> 00:26:59,798
What did Lester want?

269
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,917
Oh, Lester.
He's such a bore.

270
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:11,194
Hey, Abilene!
What do you say, buddy?

271
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:16,150
Hey there.

272
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:20,716
Merry Christmas!

273
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:24,959
This is Jackie Lee French.
This is Lois Farrow, my boss's wife.

274
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,151
What do you mean,
kissing her like that?

275
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:28,873
l oughtto slap your face!

276
00:27:29,160 --> 00:27:31,151
Well, why don't you
just kiss my ass?

277
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:33,271
l never come here
to referee no fiight.

278
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,790
Good, then come dance with me.

279
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:38,835
Get yourself a drink, honey.
l'll be back.

280
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,234
Hi, Ruth.

281
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:29,955
Wait for me outside.

282
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:43,153
1000 barrels of oil a day.

283
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,156
lt's too hot in here.
Let's go outside.

284
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:56,197
l don't want drunks
tromping on my feet.

285
00:28:56,440 --> 00:28:58,351
l got something to give you anyway.

286
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:07,516
Hi, Sonny.

287
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:09,355
Hi, Dad.

288
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:10,789
How you doing?

289
00:29:12,560 --> 00:29:13,549
Okay.

290
00:29:14,520 --> 00:29:15,635
That's good.

291
00:29:20,760 --> 00:29:21,715
See you.

292
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:23,749
Sure.

293
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:30,832
You mean my Christmas present.

294
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:33,315
l haven't had time
to get you anything yet.

295
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,879
l haven't had a minute to shop.

296
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,390
Hope you like it.
l saved for six months to get it.

297
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,757
lt'sjust beautiful.

298
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,190
lt's just what l've been wanting.

299
00:29:43,480 --> 00:29:46,153
You're so sweet,
spending all that money on me.

300
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,509
You're so sexy, Duane.

301
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:53,710
l wish l didn't have
to leave you tonight.

302
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,115
Well, you don't.

303
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:57,994
l do too.
l could just kill my mother!

304
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:03,198
She made me promise to go to a swim
party in Wichita with Lester Marlow.

305
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:05,391
Because his folks are rich.
Don't be mad.

306
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:07,153
l ain't mad, but goddamn it!

307
00:30:07,440 --> 00:30:09,874
lt's all Lester's fault.
He keeps asking Mama.

308
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:13,277
All l want to do is
stay with the man l love.

309
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,955
No, Duane! l gotta go.

310
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,675
What do you mean,
asking my girl for a date?

311
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:32,269
You turn me loose!
l will when you're ready to fiight.

312
00:31:32,560 --> 00:31:33,470
Let's have it out!

313
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,598
Here, knock off that shit, boys.
This is the Christmas season.

314
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,108
Run along, Wichita.

315
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:44,511
l can't stand here all night
protecting your shoeshine.

316
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:55,509
l don't know what to do about him.
He's so crazy about me.

317
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:58,991
Nothing against Duane,
but that's a roughneck for you.

318
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:01,435
They aren't sophisticated
about these things.

319
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:05,111
Merry Christmas!

320
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,314
Come in and let's have
some punch, boys.

321
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,119
Hi, Sonny.

322
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:22,354
Want to help me?

323
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,754
You're not dancing.
Don't you have a girlfriend?

324
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:39,429
l did. We broke up
a couple of months ago.

325
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,994
Oh? Why?

326
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:43,274
Mind my asking?

327
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:45,949
l was going with Charlene Duggs.

328
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,358
She thought l got fresh with her.
l never did, really.

329
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:53,389
We broke up because we didn't like
each other much to begin with.

330
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,791
l hope you're not sad about it.

331
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,514
l don't think Charlene's
near nice enough for you.

332
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,438
l didn't see you dancing.

333
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:03,111
No, l don't dance much.

334
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,592
Will you drive me
to the clinic again next week?

335
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,233
You bet.

336
00:34:02,760 --> 00:34:04,478
We better not dawdle here.

337
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:12,480
Oh, get out of here with that

338
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:13,469
Oh, get out of here with that

339
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,079
And don't come back no more

340
00:34:15,200 --> 00:34:16,792
Hey, look! New victims!

341
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:52,598
Duane, been looking for you.
Where's Jacy?

342
00:34:52,880 --> 00:34:55,758
Don't remind him.
We just got him quiet. Want a drink?

343
00:34:56,040 --> 00:34:58,190
Where'd you get it?
Found it in a guy's car.

344
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:00,516
He weren't looking.
Let's do something.

345
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,751
Why don't we hunt up some pussy?

346
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,157
You wouldn't know what to do with it
if we found some.

347
00:35:06,440 --> 00:35:07,156
What happened?

348
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:10,079
Lester took his girl
to a swimming party.

349
00:35:10,600 --> 00:35:12,238
Let's all go out and get a fuck.

350
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:15,956
l know where's a heifer.
lt belongs to my Uncle Hank.

351
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:17,878
Why the hell not?

352
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,720
A heifer beats nothing.
Pussy's pussy!

353
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,313
l don't want no heifer.

354
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,310
We ought to buy Billy
a piece of ass.

355
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:27,869
We oughtn't let him die a virgin.

356
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:30,557
Mama says idiot kids don't live long.

357
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:32,751
He ain't no idiot kid.
He just don't talk.

358
00:35:33,040 --> 00:35:34,359
Bet he's still a virgin.

359
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:37,279
We ought to fix him up
with Jimmie Sue.

360
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,708
lt'd make no difference to Billy.
We shouldn't try anything like that.

361
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,355
lt wouldn't cost us
more than $1 .50.

362
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:46,676
lf that's all,
we ought to get her ourselves.

363
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,315
Shit! A heifer's better
than Jimmie Sue.

364
00:35:49,840 --> 00:35:52,593
Get the stupid little thing in here.
l ain't got all night.

365
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:55,030
Let's get those pants off, boys.

366
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:01,232
You won't be a virgin much longer.
We're gonna get you laid.

367
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,919
Grab on now.
Come on, do your job.

368
00:36:07,120 --> 00:36:08,712
Get her, Billy boy!

369
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,353
This is the dumbest thing!

370
00:36:15,600 --> 00:36:18,433
He don't even know what to do!
lt worked for me.

371
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,079
Put it to her!

372
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,954
Get her, Billy.
Screw it to her, boy.

373
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,713
Stop that yelling out there.

374
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,188
lt ain't even in!

375
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:28,079
Goddamn!

376
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,517
Goddamn, you stupid little thing!

377
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:33,155
Couldn't even wait.
Look at this mess!

378
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,033
You okay, Billy?

379
00:36:46,320 --> 00:36:47,639
You all right?

380
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:01,790
Well, now l know.
ldiots as bad as Mexicans.

381
00:37:02,080 --> 00:37:04,753
Don't bother me no more
for that crazy thing.

382
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,510
Wouldn't mess with him again
for less than three and a half.

383
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,395
Which one of you bloodied his nose?

384
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,674
l've told you not to fght with Billy.
He don't understand about fiighting.

385
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:45,235
What happened?

386
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:48,557
lt weren't none of us, Sam.
No, it was Jimmie Sue.

387
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:52,433
Jimmie Sue?
How'd he get messed up with her?

388
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,794
We bought him a piece of ass.
Thought he was tired of being a virgin.

389
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:00,316
She got mad about something
and bloodied his nose.

390
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,153
You boys get on out of here.

391
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,709
l don't want to have no more
to do with you.

392
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,075
Scaring a poor, unfortunate creature
like Billy...

393
00:38:10,360 --> 00:38:12,476
...just so you could have a few laughs.

394
00:38:12,720 --> 00:38:16,156
l've been around that
trashy behaviour all my life.

395
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:18,915
l'm getting tired
of putting up with it.

396
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:21,954
You can stay out of
this pool hall, my cafe...

397
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:24,356
...and my picture show too.

398
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:27,920
l don't want no more
of your business.

399
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:32,474
We didn't mean
for anything bad to happen, Sam.

400
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,233
You didn't even have
the decency to wash his face.

401
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:00,957
We're his best customers.
He can't run us off.

402
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,989
Can he?

403
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:17,830
Lucky l fell asleep. l'd hate
not being able to shoot no pool.

404
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:35,712
You sure he won't come?

405
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:39,555
You know he won't.
He's starting basketball practice.

406
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:27,199
lt's all right.

407
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,350
l'm sorry l cried.

408
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:52,915
Just scared, l guess.

409
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:56,316
He ain't gonna come.

410
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:59,030
They're probably running plays
right now.

411
00:42:59,400 --> 00:43:01,470
No, not scared of that.

412
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,153
Scared l could never do this,
l guess.

413
00:43:07,840 --> 00:43:11,071
Can't seem to do anything
without crying about it.

414
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:14,998
How could you like me?

415
00:43:15,360 --> 00:43:16,952
l like you.

416
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:21,233
l'm glad.

417
00:45:13,120 --> 00:45:15,680
Come in. l ain't gonna
throw bottles at you.

418
00:45:19,600 --> 00:45:21,875
What've you been doing?
You lost weight.

419
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,668
Ain't had any of
your cheeseburgers in weeks.

420
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:27,231
Come on.
l'll fix you one.

421
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:31,032
Even though that wasn't a nice thing
y'all done to Billy.

422
00:45:31,320 --> 00:45:33,117
Can't blame Sam.

423
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,312
Was that your idea?

424
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,512
Duane's?
He was there, wasn't he?

425
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:41,595
He didn't have the decency
to own up to it.

426
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:47,872
Don't worry, l won't tell on him.
l should, though.

427
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:50,678
Sure smells good.

428
00:45:51,040 --> 00:45:52,792
One thing l know for sure.

429
00:45:53,080 --> 00:45:56,152
You can't sneeze here without
somebody offering a handkerchief.

430
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,396
What you mean?
Nothing.

431
00:45:59,440 --> 00:46:01,908
lt's an awful small town
for any kind of carrying on.

432
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:05,318
Don't forget to put onions on.

433
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,475
And some people got a lot of guns.

434
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:15,069
All right, you don't need
my advice anyway.

435
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:18,596
Why don't you go play a record?
These'll be done in a minute.

436
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:48,955
Just come in to say hello
to Genevieve.

437
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,678
Food's getting cold.

438
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:09,988
What are you grinning about?

439
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,999
Chicken fry me a steak.
Try to use meat this time.

440
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:23,833
l heard about
the ball game last night.

441
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:27,158
121 to 14.

442
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:29,317
Must be pretty near a record.

443
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:33,273
Sam.

444
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,039
l'm sorry.

445
00:47:37,320 --> 00:47:39,675
l reckon y'all need glasses.

446
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,077
Now hold still.

447
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:55,071
Want some more cookies?

448
00:47:55,760 --> 00:47:58,115
More milk?
l'm full.

449
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,115
How come you've stayed
with the coach?

450
00:48:10,360 --> 00:48:11,952
You don't like him much.

451
00:48:12,240 --> 00:48:14,435
l wasn't brought up
to leave a husband.

452
00:48:14,720 --> 00:48:16,278
l guess that's why.

453
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:18,791
Maybe l wasjust scared to.

454
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,719
l never noticed
how ugly this room is.

455
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:24,399
What's your favourite colour?

456
00:48:24,680 --> 00:48:25,954
l don't know. Blue.

457
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:28,879
Maybe l'll re paper it.
Why'd you marry him?

458
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:30,070
l don't know.

459
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:33,636
My mother didn't like him.
Maybe that was it.

460
00:48:33,920 --> 00:48:35,592
l was 20 years old.

461
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:39,555
l thought hairy chested
football coaches were about it.

462
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:42,469
l'm gonna buy us a new quilt.

463
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:44,148
A blue one.

464
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,835
What you think
he'd do if he found us?

465
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:49,792
Shoot us, probably.

466
00:48:50,520 --> 00:48:53,717
He's always glad to have an excuse
to use his deer rifle.

467
00:49:10,680 --> 00:49:13,831
l thought you boys wanted to fsh.
Keep an eye on them corks.

468
00:49:20,840 --> 00:49:23,593
l don't think there's anything
in this tank except turtles.

469
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:26,348
That's what l like about it,
tell you the truth.

470
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,108
Want to try one?
Sure.

471
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,428
l never liked to clean fsh
or eat them either.

472
00:49:34,720 --> 00:49:37,473
You spend half your time
picking out bone.

473
00:49:39,920 --> 00:49:42,354
l just come out here
to get a little scenery.

474
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:44,915
Too pretty a day to spend in town.

475
00:49:48,880 --> 00:49:51,838
You wouldn't believe
how this country's changed.

476
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,316
First time l seen it,
there wasn't a mesquite tree on it.

477
00:49:58,600 --> 00:50:00,477
Or a prickly pear neither.

478
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:03,036
l used to own this land, you know.

479
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,994
First time l watered a horse
at this tank...

480
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,350
...was more than 40 years ago.

481
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:13,669
l reckon the reason
l drag you out here is...

482
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:17,839
...l'm as sentimental as the next
fellow when it comes to old times.

483
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:23,999
Old times.

484
00:50:24,760 --> 00:50:27,354
l brought a young lady
swimming out here once...

485
00:50:27,800 --> 00:50:29,711
...more than 20 years ago.

486
00:50:32,680 --> 00:50:35,478
lt was after my wife
had lost her mind.

487
00:50:35,760 --> 00:50:37,318
And my boys was dead.

488
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:44,235
Me and this young lady
was pretty wild, l guess.

489
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:46,872
ln pretty deep.

490
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:53,793
We used to come here on horseback
and swim without no bathing suits.

491
00:50:56,880 --> 00:51:00,475
One day she wanted to swim
the horses across this tank.

492
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,832
Kind of a crazy thing to do,
but we done it anyway.

493
00:51:04,840 --> 00:51:07,991
She bet me a silver dollar
she could beat me across.

494
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,313
She did.

495
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:14,917
This old horse l was riding
didn't want to take the water.

496
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:18,715
She was always looking for
something to do like that.

497
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,512
Something wild.

498
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,398
l bet she's still got
that silver dollar.

499
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,712
Whatever happened to her?

500
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:33,832
She growed up.

501
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:36,950
She was just a girl then, really.

502
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,958
Let me help you with that.

503
00:51:42,440 --> 00:51:45,113
Why didn't you ever marry her
after your wife died?

504
00:51:47,600 --> 00:51:49,318
She was already married.

505
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:57,598
Her and her husband was young
and miserable with one another...

506
00:51:57,880 --> 00:51:59,996
...like so many
young married folks are.

507
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:03,314
l thought they'd change
with some age...

508
00:52:03,720 --> 00:52:05,472
...but it didn'tturn out that way.

509
00:52:05,760 --> 00:52:08,354
ls being married always so miserable?
Not really.

510
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:11,195
About 80 percent of the time,
l guess.

511
00:52:13,840 --> 00:52:16,912
We ought to go to
a real fshing tank next year.

512
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,397
lt don't do to think
about things like that too much.

513
00:52:22,280 --> 00:52:25,033
lf she was here,
l'd probably be just as crazy now...

514
00:52:25,320 --> 00:52:27,959
...as l was then
in about five minutes.

515
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:30,238
Ain'tthat ridiculous?

516
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,391
No, it ain't really.

517
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:38,673
Being crazy about a woman like her
is always the right thing to do.

518
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:44,110
Being a decrepit old bag of bones,
that's what's ridiculous.

519
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,999
Getting old.

520
00:52:56,560 --> 00:53:01,236
Talk to her please, Mr. Sun

521
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:08,669
Speak to her, Mr. Rainbow

522
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:15,589
And take her under your branches

523
00:53:17,560 --> 00:53:20,358
Mr. Tree

524
00:53:25,760 --> 00:53:30,629
Whisper to her, Mr. Wind

525
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:37,758
l'm glad l wasn't on fre.

526
00:53:38,040 --> 00:53:41,077
l'd have burned to death
before you got one button undone.

527
00:53:41,360 --> 00:53:43,351
l'm going to get a drink of water.

528
00:53:51,120 --> 00:53:54,237
l wondered where you went.
Annie Annie asleep?

529
00:54:08,840 --> 00:54:11,229
Nice. You a virgin?

530
00:54:12,560 --> 00:54:13,834
Guess l am.

531
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:15,990
Too bad.

532
00:54:17,480 --> 00:54:20,153
l don't want to be, though.
l don't blame you.

533
00:54:20,840 --> 00:54:22,512
Come see me when you're not.

534
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:49,955
Why don't we just go someplace?
l'm sick and tired of this town.

535
00:54:50,240 --> 00:54:52,629
You're the only friend l got.
You mean, go and stay gone?

536
00:54:52,920 --> 00:54:54,319
No, l don't know.

537
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:58,149
Hey, we go to Mexico.
Be back sometime Monday.

538
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,638
Would the pickup make it?
Yeah. How much money you got?

539
00:55:01,880 --> 00:55:03,074
Thirty bucks about.

540
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,954
Well, l got 40.
We can make it. Come on!

541
00:55:08,040 --> 00:55:09,155
You guys want

542
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,637
Where are you going?
Mexico.

543
00:55:11,880 --> 00:55:12,630
Where?

544
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:22,277
Better come with us, Sam.
We're headed for the valley.

545
00:55:22,800 --> 00:55:24,472
Where did you say?
Mexico.

546
00:55:24,800 --> 00:55:26,870
lt's about the wildest.
All the way down.

547
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:31,308
You going all the way to Mexico
tonight in this old heap ofjunk?

548
00:55:31,600 --> 00:55:32,749
My God!

549
00:55:33,040 --> 00:55:35,998
Reckon the town will get along
without us till Monday?

550
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:36,990
l reckon.

551
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,794
lf l was young enough,
l'd go with you.

552
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,595
Need any money?
No, we got plenty.

553
00:55:43,320 --> 00:55:46,676
Well, you'd better take some
for some insurance.

554
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:50,398
Take money below that border,
it sort of melts.

555
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:51,874
Thanks, Sam.

556
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:55,114
Try not to drink too much
of that buggy water.

557
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:58,198
We'll just drink beer and tequila.

558
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,470
You catch the clap, you'll wish
you hadn't drunk nothing.

559
00:56:14,600 --> 00:56:15,715
Oh, well.

560
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:17,509
We'll see you.

561
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,313
So long!

562
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:50,999
Hey, wake up!

563
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:52,435
We're back.

564
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:57,153
My stomach don't feel so good.
Got any more Tums?

565
00:56:57,520 --> 00:57:00,956
You ate them all
before we got to San Antonio.

566
00:57:02,200 --> 00:57:05,510
Genevieve will have something.
My stomach don't feel so good.

567
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:09,236
Closed.

568
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,039
Closed?

569
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:15,151
l ain't never seen her closed before.

570
00:57:15,440 --> 00:57:17,476
No, not even for Christmas.

571
00:57:18,920 --> 00:57:22,151
Maybe Sam will have something.
l'm sick.

572
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:45,638
Well, it ain't that early.

573
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,872
Must be some kind of holiday.

574
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:50,276
Sam don't close on holidays.

575
00:57:50,560 --> 00:57:52,755
Maybe he had to go someplace.

576
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,117
Let's go askAndy.

577
00:58:11,080 --> 00:58:13,594
Somebody will steal the town.
Where is everybody?

578
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:15,718
Asleep.
Everybody that's got sense.

579
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,036
Why'd Sam close the cafe?

580
00:58:18,560 --> 00:58:20,869
Y'all been gone, ain't you?

581
00:58:21,480 --> 00:58:23,038
Gone to Mexico.

582
00:58:23,480 --> 00:58:25,277
You don't know about it.
What?

583
00:58:25,560 --> 00:58:27,198
Sam died yesterday morning.

584
00:58:29,040 --> 00:58:29,916
Died?

585
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,838
Quite a blow.

586
00:58:32,120 --> 00:58:35,396
Keeled over one of
the snooker tables, had a stroke.

587
00:58:36,440 --> 00:58:38,192
Sam the Lion?

588
00:58:39,520 --> 00:58:40,430
Sam's dead.

589
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:42,398
He was quite a fellow.

590
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:47,233
He had his own way of doing things,
that's for sure.

591
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,639
They found his will.
Craziest thing you ever heard.

592
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:56,234
He left you the pool hall, Sonny.
What do you think about that?

593
00:58:57,800 --> 00:58:59,791
He left Genevieve the cafe.

594
00:59:00,080 --> 00:59:02,992
That's the only thing he done
that made any sense.

595
00:59:03,480 --> 00:59:05,994
Leftthe picture show
to old Miss Mosey.

596
00:59:06,280 --> 00:59:09,670
Hell, she's too far gone
to even run a popcorn machine.

597
00:59:10,240 --> 00:59:11,958
And the craziest thing of all...

598
00:59:12,240 --> 00:59:16,028
...he left $1000 to Joe Bob Blanton,
the preacher's boy.

599
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,756
Beats all l ever heard of.

600
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:21,515
He could just as easily
left that to me.

601
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,270
l deserve it at least as much
as that ignorant little bastard.

602
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:28,791
Anyhow, it's done.

603
00:59:29,080 --> 00:59:30,957
They're burying him tomorrow.

604
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:48,115
Come in.

605
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:04,790
l love you.
l love you too.

606
01:02:34,880 --> 01:02:36,279
Oh, Duane, hurry.

607
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:11,559
What's wrong, honey?

608
01:03:13,480 --> 01:03:14,833
l don't know.

609
01:03:16,480 --> 01:03:18,789
That tickles.
l can't stand to be tickled.

610
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:29,717
Aren't you gonna do it?

611
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,034
l don't know what's wrong.

612
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,397
How could anything be wrong?
Just go on and do it.

613
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:41,078
What's the matter with you?

614
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,752
l don't know.
Something's happened.

615
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:46,753
Get off a minute!
You mightfall and mash me.

616
01:03:47,040 --> 01:03:48,314
l don't know what happened.

617
01:03:49,080 --> 01:03:51,674
l knew you couldn't do it.
Now l'll never not be a virgin!

618
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,876
What do we say?
The whole class knows.

619
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,469
l want to cry.
You're the meanest boy l ever saw.

620
01:03:56,720 --> 01:03:58,756
My mother was dead right about you.

621
01:03:59,880 --> 01:04:00,995
l don't know what happened.

622
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,192
Don't go out there!
We haven't had time to do it.

623
01:04:04,440 --> 01:04:07,000
l don't want one soul to know.
You better not tell.

624
01:04:08,360 --> 01:04:10,078
You just pretend it was wonderful!

625
01:04:10,360 --> 01:04:12,032
l don't know what happened.

626
01:04:13,560 --> 01:04:15,551
lf you say that again,
l'll bite you!

627
01:04:35,080 --> 01:04:37,275
Tell us about it, Jacy.
What was it like?

628
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:42,555
l just can't describe it.

629
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,394
l just can't describe it in words.

630
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,717
Texas, our Texas

631
01:04:56,960 --> 01:05:00,999
All hail the mighty state

632
01:05:01,560 --> 01:05:04,677
Texas, our Texas

633
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,833
So wonderful, so great

634
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,716
Largest and grandest

635
01:05:12,960 --> 01:05:16,839
Withstanding every test

636
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:20,908
O empire wide and glorious

637
01:05:21,160 --> 01:05:25,278
You stand supremely blessed

638
01:05:25,840 --> 01:05:28,274
God bless you, Texas

639
01:05:28,520 --> 01:05:30,715
l can do it now.
l know l can.

640
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:38,071
That you may grow
ln power and worth

641
01:05:38,560 --> 01:05:43,429
Throughout the ages on

642
01:06:03,920 --> 01:06:06,992
Quit prissing! l don'tthink
you did it right anyway.

643
01:06:17,080 --> 01:06:18,149
Come on.

644
01:06:28,040 --> 01:06:31,191
lt's your graduation present.
Hope you like it.

645
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:42,756
l never seen one as nice.

646
01:06:57,080 --> 01:06:58,593
What's on your feeble mind?

647
01:06:58,960 --> 01:07:00,473
Same as it's been.
l want a date.

648
01:07:01,640 --> 01:07:03,517
Why don't you just
go back to Mexico?

649
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:06,109
l guess girls are easier
to please down there.

650
01:07:06,600 --> 01:07:08,318
Just go with me one more time.

651
01:07:08,560 --> 01:07:09,959
You can at least see me.

652
01:07:10,240 --> 01:07:12,515
Find somebody else to pester.
Got a new boyfriend.

653
01:07:12,760 --> 01:07:14,671
l can't talk to you.
Who?

654
01:07:14,920 --> 01:07:16,399
Bobby Sheen, of course.

655
01:07:18,160 --> 01:07:19,832
You crazy?
l certainly am not.

656
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:23,550
l guess l wanted to go with him
all along and never realized it.

657
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:26,309
Maybe we'll see you
in Wichita sometime.

658
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:42,999
Goddamn it to hell!

659
01:07:54,840 --> 01:07:56,114
l hate to see you go.

660
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:58,356
Not a goddamn thing
to stay for.

661
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:01,479
Roughnecks say you can get a job
in Odessa anytime.

662
01:08:02,320 --> 01:08:03,912
Come on back if you don't.

663
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:18,916
You hear they busted up,
let me know.

664
01:08:52,960 --> 01:08:53,870
Didn't hear you.

665
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:55,990
Gene home?

666
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,750
No, he and Mama went to the club.

667
01:09:03,800 --> 01:09:05,518
Why are you home
on a Saturday night?

668
01:09:07,760 --> 01:09:09,990
Bobbie Sheen ran off and got married.

669
01:09:12,720 --> 01:09:14,153
Annie Annie Martin.

670
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:19,234
Want me to turn the TV off?

671
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:23,669
No, l'm gonna go play pool.
Tell your dad that well came in okay.

672
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,753
l wish l could go to the pool hall.
l've always wanted to.

673
01:09:28,000 --> 01:09:30,878
lt's terrible, the things
girls aren't allowed to do.

674
01:09:32,800 --> 01:09:35,633
Well, hell, come on.
l'll show you the pool hall.

675
01:09:35,920 --> 01:09:37,069
Aren'tthere people there?

676
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:39,828
lf there are,
they'll be in back asleep now.

677
01:09:40,120 --> 01:09:43,112
Won't bother us.
Got my own key.

678
01:09:44,360 --> 01:09:46,112
Okay, l will then.

679
01:10:01,480 --> 01:10:03,914
Goodness, it sure is dark in here.

680
01:12:22,280 --> 01:12:25,716
What a night! l never thought
something like this would happen.

681
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,358
How about hopping out?

682
01:13:03,200 --> 01:13:05,714
He's just awful!
Why do you fool with him?

683
01:13:05,960 --> 01:13:08,554
Daddy's nicer than him, isn't he?
He sure is.

684
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:10,711
Your daddy's a very nice man.

685
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,474
l ought to give Abilene hell
instead of him.

686
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:16,877
Bobby was the last one.
l'm just gonna be an old maid.

687
01:13:17,160 --> 01:13:20,755
That'sjust the way it goes.
You win a few, you lose a few.

688
01:13:21,040 --> 01:13:22,109
What do you do?

689
01:13:22,400 --> 01:13:24,356
Nothing's ever the way
it's supposed to be.

690
01:13:24,640 --> 01:13:26,232
You're right. Come on.

691
01:13:29,880 --> 01:13:33,793
l want to tell you what l've done
has not worked out too well.

692
01:13:34,080 --> 01:13:37,709
l think maybe we better think of
something else for you.

693
01:13:39,440 --> 01:13:42,512
l guess Ruth Popper's got
about as good a setup as anyone.

694
01:13:42,800 --> 01:13:46,475
Why, sure. Sonny's reasonably
good looking and he's young.

695
01:13:46,760 --> 01:13:49,752
Don't you know?
lt's been going on about six months.

696
01:13:50,000 --> 01:13:52,514
l thought you kids knew everything.
That's silly!

697
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:54,028
She's 40 years old.

698
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,834
So am l, honey.
lt's kind of an itchy age.

699
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,553
Want an orange?

700
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,432
l don't believe it.

701
01:14:01,160 --> 01:14:03,754
Sonny's always wanted to go with me.

702
01:14:08,920 --> 01:14:10,911
Pretty easy shot, sheriff.

703
01:14:19,400 --> 01:14:20,594
Sheriff, we got trouble.

704
01:14:22,600 --> 01:14:25,478
Goddamn you, Monroe!
You made me scratch.

705
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:29,594
Sorry, sheriff, but Johnny Clarg's
little girl's been kidnapped.

706
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:32,872
They say the preacher's boy put her
in his car two hours ago.

707
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,988
What the hell? Maybe Joe Bob
just give her a ride home.

708
01:14:37,280 --> 01:14:39,635
Be doing her a favour
in this hot weather.

709
01:14:39,920 --> 01:14:42,434
Who'd want to kidnap Molly Clarg?

710
01:14:42,680 --> 01:14:44,238
l just know she's not home.

711
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:46,829
They was seen headed toward Olney.

712
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:49,588
Mrs. Clarg's afraid
that Joe Bob might be...

713
01:14:49,880 --> 01:14:52,917
...gonna molest her or something.

714
01:14:53,160 --> 01:14:54,991
You and some of these boys
come with us.

715
01:14:55,720 --> 01:14:58,712
lf that's the way it is,
no telling what we'll fnd.

716
01:15:24,280 --> 01:15:25,633
Molly!

717
01:15:30,440 --> 01:15:32,396
Get him! Ain't you going to?

718
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:34,114
Here's my little girl.

719
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:37,073
He's the one that done it.
Why don't you get him?

720
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,033
lf my husband was here,
he'd kill him dead.

721
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:48,392
What'd you do to that child?
We know you done something.

722
01:15:48,720 --> 01:15:49,914
Come on.

723
01:15:52,440 --> 01:15:53,714
Filthy!

724
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:57,748
Here now, grab her.
None of this goddamn frenzy.

725
01:16:01,920 --> 01:16:03,558
lt's the Lord's justice, son.

726
01:16:03,800 --> 01:16:06,030
You'll suffer with the murderer
and the thief.

727
01:16:06,320 --> 01:16:10,029
Sonny, drive that Plymouth to town.
We gotta get this man to jail.

728
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,359
Doctor said he didn't do nothing.
Never had the guts.

729
01:16:22,600 --> 01:16:24,830
Preacher's boy.
Sheriff fgured he done something.

730
01:16:32,360 --> 01:16:35,079
lsn't it terrible, Sonny?
Did you see anything?

731
01:16:35,360 --> 01:16:37,351
Weren't nothing to see
except Mrs. Clarg.

732
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:40,034
lf she had a gun,
she might've killed us all.

733
01:16:40,320 --> 01:16:41,673
Joe Bob didn't do nothing.

734
01:16:41,960 --> 01:16:45,111
He must've done something.
lt scares me to death.

735
01:16:45,360 --> 01:16:48,432
You never can tell when something
terrible is gonna happen.

736
01:16:49,840 --> 01:16:51,637
lt's okay.
They got him now.

737
01:16:51,920 --> 01:16:53,592
l called you before.

738
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:55,470
You did?

739
01:16:56,440 --> 01:16:57,589
l felt lonesome.

740
01:16:57,880 --> 01:16:59,871
Thought you might wanna
drive around.

741
01:17:03,200 --> 01:17:05,430
Well, l'm supposed to be someplace.

742
01:17:05,720 --> 01:17:09,315
l'm still a little scared.
Please take me riding.

743
01:17:14,960 --> 01:17:16,188
Where will we drive?

744
01:17:40,680 --> 01:17:41,749
Ever hear from Duane?

745
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,115
Got a postcard.

746
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:45,949
l really feel sad about that.

747
01:17:47,560 --> 01:17:49,630
He's making 320 a month.
Said he bought a car.

748
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:54,792
l'll always be a little in love with
Duane. We had too much against us.

749
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:58,148
lt wasn't easy
being the one to break up.

750
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:28,716
What?

751
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,271
l don't like to hurry.

752
01:19:07,080 --> 01:19:10,675
Why don't we go to Wichita
and get a motel room?

753
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:13,235
l'm afraid to.
My folks are watching me.

754
01:19:13,520 --> 01:19:15,511
They know l don't wanna
go to college.

755
01:19:15,800 --> 01:19:18,189
They might think we'll run off
and get married.

756
01:19:20,360 --> 01:19:22,476
We'll do it when it's safe.

757
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,555
We got all summer.

758
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:18,273
Hey, buddy!

759
01:20:19,840 --> 01:20:20,829
You turned roughneck.

760
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:23,395
Gotta make a living
so l can keep the pool hall open.

761
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:24,556
When did you get in?

762
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:27,354
About 2.
l thought l'd surprise you.

763
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,076
ls this yours?

764
01:20:30,360 --> 01:20:33,750
How about that?
38,000 miles and she runs like new.

765
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:35,632
Do you want a beer?
Not me.

766
01:20:36,320 --> 01:20:38,515
That's all l eat
for breakfast anymore.

767
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,677
Sure is a nice car.

768
01:20:40,960 --> 01:20:44,555
l like to drive it so much, l thought
l'd just drop home for the weekend.

769
01:20:46,480 --> 01:20:49,392
You can't take too good care
of a car like this.

770
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,078
l wash her every week.

771
01:20:52,360 --> 01:20:53,793
lt looks great.

772
01:20:54,640 --> 01:20:55,595
Hear about Joe Bob?

773
01:20:55,880 --> 01:20:58,030
l always knew he was crazy.

774
01:20:58,320 --> 01:21:01,835
He didn't do nothing, except get her
to take her underpants off.

775
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:03,993
He's out of jail now.

776
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:06,877
Are you still screwing
that old lady?

777
01:21:08,240 --> 01:21:10,674
No. Yeah.
l've been kind of busy.

778
01:21:11,480 --> 01:21:13,596
l seen old Leroy last week.

779
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:16,309
Said you and Jacy
been going together.

780
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:18,234
We have, a little.

781
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,796
She's been bored, so sometimes
we go eat Mexican food.

782
01:21:22,120 --> 01:21:24,270
l hear that ain't all
you been eating.

783
01:21:25,400 --> 01:21:28,392
Whoever told you that don't know
what he's talking about.

784
01:21:28,800 --> 01:21:30,518
l been going with her.
Why not?

785
01:21:30,760 --> 01:21:33,228
l never said l blamed you for it.

786
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:36,514
l never thought you'd do that.
l thought we was friends.

787
01:21:36,760 --> 01:21:39,911
We are. What you so mad for?
l never done nothing.

788
01:21:40,200 --> 01:21:41,474
Screwing my girl ain't nothing?

789
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:42,590
l ain't.

790
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:45,195
Hell, you ain't!
Well, l ain't.

791
01:21:45,480 --> 01:21:47,118
She's not your girl.
She is!

792
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:48,674
You don't even live here anymore.

793
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:51,679
That don't make no difference!
l'm getting her back.

794
01:21:51,920 --> 01:21:53,512
She'll marry me someday.

795
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,796
She won't.
We're meant to get married.

796
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:57,433
She's off to college soon.

797
01:21:57,720 --> 01:22:00,837
l doubt l'll get to go with her
myself, once she gets off.

798
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:03,918
l never saw what it could hurt
to go with her this summer.

799
01:22:04,200 --> 01:22:06,509
She'll never marry you.
Don't tell me she won't!

800
01:22:07,520 --> 01:22:09,317
She'd never let you screw her.

801
01:22:09,600 --> 01:22:12,068
l was just seeing how honest you was.

802
01:22:12,360 --> 01:22:15,193
Jacy'd never let you screw her.
You ain'tthat good a cocksman.

803
01:22:16,160 --> 01:22:18,435
You never even screwed Charlene
all that time.

804
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:19,550
Course l didn't!

805
01:22:19,840 --> 01:22:21,034
You know why?

806
01:22:21,320 --> 01:22:24,232
Because you had the pickup
all the time Saturday night.

807
01:22:24,560 --> 01:22:26,039
Nobody could've screwed
in the time l had.

808
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:29,073
l could've screwed her in five minutes.
l wouldn't need no pickup.

809
01:22:29,480 --> 01:22:32,438
She only went with you because
you was in the backfiield...

810
01:22:32,720 --> 01:22:34,358
...and l was in the line.

811
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,318
What you talking about?
We was in love.

812
01:22:36,560 --> 01:22:39,518
You was. She likes me as much
as she ever liked you.

813
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:40,910
That's a lie.

814
01:22:41,160 --> 01:22:42,513
l'll stay with her all night too.

815
01:22:42,760 --> 01:22:44,113
She promised.
You won't.

816
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:45,395
Why shouldn't l?

817
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:48,996
She told me you couldn't do it
that time in Wichita Falls.

818
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:12,399
What happened?

819
01:23:28,200 --> 01:23:31,192
There's a lady in the waiting room.
She sent you this.

820
01:23:34,400 --> 01:23:37,790
May l come in and see you
a little while? Ruth

821
01:23:43,560 --> 01:23:45,073
Could you tell her l'm asleep?

822
01:23:45,760 --> 01:23:46,954
Please?

823
01:23:47,240 --> 01:23:48,468
All right.

824
01:24:13,760 --> 01:24:14,829
That too cold?

825
01:24:15,120 --> 01:24:16,553
No, it's great.

826
01:24:18,360 --> 01:24:20,920
l hear Duane joined the Army.

827
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:23,031
Good place for him too.

828
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,550
He didn't mean to hit me
with the bottle.

829
01:24:25,840 --> 01:24:28,434
That boy's always had
meanness in him.

830
01:24:29,040 --> 01:24:32,271
Jacy's the kind of girl that
brings out the meanness in a man.

831
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:34,357
She'sjust like her grandmother.

832
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:40,475
l hadn't ought to talk about them.
We was all good friends once.

833
01:24:41,520 --> 01:24:43,670
Dan roughnecked with Gene Farrow.

834
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,154
He and Lois used to live
in this one room place...

835
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:49,158
...over the newspaper office.

836
01:24:49,600 --> 01:24:52,990
Lois couldn't afford a flour sack,
much less a mink.

837
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:58,233
l've always had
a soft spot for her, though.

838
01:25:00,480 --> 01:25:03,199
l wondered a lot of times
what would've happened...

839
01:25:03,480 --> 01:25:05,948
...if my Dan had made
the strikes that Gene made.

840
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:08,549
They offered that rig to him fiirst.

841
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,318
Dan Morgan never took a chance
in his life.

842
01:25:16,440 --> 01:25:17,873
Do you wish y'all had made it?

843
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:24,194
Sure, l wish we'd made it.

844
01:25:26,520 --> 01:25:29,751
l guess the Army won't take me now,
l just got one good eye.

845
01:25:30,040 --> 01:25:32,190
You wanna go to Korea
and get killed?

846
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:36,519
You ain't got your senses back yet,
what few you ever had.

847
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,195
The cafe won't run itself.
You rest up now.

848
01:25:40,480 --> 01:25:42,596
Here's for the cheeseburger.

849
01:25:42,880 --> 01:25:45,474
l'll bring your change
when l bring your supper.

850
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:17,273
Come on in.

851
01:26:25,680 --> 01:26:27,591
l was so worried.
l just had to see you.

852
01:26:27,880 --> 01:26:29,438
l've been missing you.

853
01:26:29,720 --> 01:26:32,598
And l'm a lot better than l was.
Here, sit down.

854
01:26:33,240 --> 01:26:36,710
You can't believe how famous we are.
We're all anybody talks about.

855
01:26:37,000 --> 01:26:39,309
Yeah, l guess so.
l want us to get married.

856
01:26:40,840 --> 01:26:41,909
l really do.

857
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:43,070
Get married?

858
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:45,396
As soon as you want to.
Don't you want to?

859
01:26:47,960 --> 01:26:51,157
The town will be knocked for a loop.
They'll never forget it.

860
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:52,799
Ain't you going to college?

861
01:26:53,040 --> 01:26:55,349
l love you,
and that's more important.

862
01:26:57,360 --> 01:26:59,237
You were so dear to fiightfor me.

863
01:26:59,640 --> 01:27:01,232
My folks won't like it
but we'll run off.

864
01:27:01,520 --> 01:27:03,192
They'll kill us.
No, they won't.

865
01:27:03,480 --> 01:27:05,198
They'll kill me.
They'll get over it.

866
01:27:05,480 --> 01:27:07,152
You're working for Daddy now anyway.

867
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:10,432
Pretty soon, they'll love you
just as much as l do.

868
01:27:13,120 --> 01:27:14,439
Can we?

869
01:27:15,080 --> 01:27:17,992
Sure, l just hope l can see to drive.

870
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:20,470
Don't you worry.
l can drive.

871
01:27:30,360 --> 01:27:31,918
Don't do that, Sonny.

872
01:27:32,400 --> 01:27:33,753
Why not?

873
01:27:34,040 --> 01:27:36,110
We're man and wife now.
We can do anything.

874
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:38,709
Not while l'm driving.
l might have a wreck.

875
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,479
Wouldn't it be awful if Mama
and Daddy got the police after us?

876
01:27:43,760 --> 01:27:46,911
They don't even know where we are.
l had to leave them a note.

877
01:27:47,720 --> 01:27:49,631
So they wouldn't be worried
out of their mind.

878
01:27:49,920 --> 01:27:51,319
You shouldn't have done that.

879
01:27:51,560 --> 01:27:53,755
l fgured they'd have
to know sometime.

880
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:56,070
Well, what could they get us for?

881
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:59,079
We got a right to get married.
Ain't we?

882
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:01,078
l guess so.

883
01:28:04,200 --> 01:28:07,192
l wish you didn't have that
stupid eye patch. lt's really creepy.

884
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,154
l can take it off pretty soon.

885
01:28:11,080 --> 01:28:15,358
About two hours will be Lake Texoma.
Have a room to ourself.

886
01:28:15,640 --> 01:28:18,996
My goodness! You're sitting so close,
l can barely drive.

887
01:28:44,920 --> 01:28:46,114
Oh, goodness.

888
01:29:08,640 --> 01:29:09,390
Howdy.

889
01:29:09,640 --> 01:29:11,790
What part of Texas y'all from?
Anarene.

890
01:29:12,080 --> 01:29:13,752
Newlyweds, ain't you?

891
01:29:14,360 --> 01:29:17,591
Y'all better follow me in.
Somebody's looking for you.

892
01:29:17,840 --> 01:29:20,513
We got a right to get married.
How can you arrest us?

893
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,912
l ain't arresting you.
l just want you to come with me.

894
01:29:24,160 --> 01:29:25,718
l don't know what your rights are.

895
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:27,638
l guess we better follow him.

896
01:29:27,880 --> 01:29:30,269
l'll be heartbroken
if my folks have done this.

897
01:29:35,560 --> 01:29:38,438
You think l worked hard so
my daughter'd end up in a pool hall?

898
01:29:38,880 --> 01:29:41,189
We was gonna get an apartment.
l'll bet!

899
01:29:41,480 --> 01:29:42,515
Where are your car keys?

900
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,870
lt's a hell of a note!

901
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:47,634
Shut up and take her home.
You bet l will!

902
01:29:47,880 --> 01:29:51,270
You take her car.
As far as l'm concerned, he can walk!

903
01:30:18,720 --> 01:30:21,518
Not much of a wedding night, huh?

904
01:30:21,800 --> 01:30:22,710
Not much of one.

905
01:30:23,000 --> 01:30:26,276
Here. Have a little drink of bourbon.
lt'll pick you up.

906
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,431
Take all of it. l'm gonna drive.

907
01:30:30,840 --> 01:30:32,114
You won't believe this...

908
01:30:32,400 --> 01:30:35,472
...but you're lucky we got you
clear of her quick as we did.

909
01:30:35,880 --> 01:30:38,633
You'd have been better off
staying with Ruth Popper.

910
01:30:38,880 --> 01:30:41,075
Does everybody know about that?

911
01:30:41,360 --> 01:30:42,475
Course!

912
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:47,118
Sounded like a good deal to me.
Shouldn't let Jacy turn your head.

913
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:49,277
Well, she's prettier.

914
01:30:50,200 --> 01:30:54,193
l guess l shouldn't have, though.
l guess l treated her terrible.

915
01:30:54,480 --> 01:30:55,799
Guess you did.

916
01:31:15,040 --> 01:31:16,917
Sure weren't out of Texas very long.

917
01:31:17,200 --> 01:31:20,078
Oklahoma's not much
of an improvement.

918
01:31:25,320 --> 01:31:27,072
lt's not the same now.

919
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,712
Nothing's really been right
since Sam the Lion died.

920
01:31:37,160 --> 01:31:38,912
No, it hasn't.

921
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,038
Oh, God.

922
01:31:46,800 --> 01:31:49,360
l get sad if l think of Sam for long.

923
01:31:53,160 --> 01:31:55,116
Did you know he had beautiful hands?

924
01:31:56,880 --> 01:31:59,030
l guess you liked him, didn't you?

925
01:32:00,200 --> 01:32:02,156
I guess everybody did.

926
01:32:04,200 --> 01:32:07,317
Well, l'll tell you,
it was different with me.

927
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:08,993
l loved him.

928
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:12,431
He loved me too.

929
01:32:17,880 --> 01:32:19,552
Are you the one he'd take swimming...

930
01:32:20,160 --> 01:32:21,434
...out at the tank?

931
01:32:21,680 --> 01:32:23,636
He told you about that?

932
01:32:24,960 --> 01:32:26,393
Yeah, l was the one.

933
01:32:29,880 --> 01:32:32,553
l guess if it wasn't for Sam...

934
01:32:32,840 --> 01:32:36,196
...l'd just about have missed it.
Whatever it is.

935
01:32:37,800 --> 01:32:40,917
l'd have been one of them
amity types that thinks...

936
01:32:41,200 --> 01:32:44,670
...that playing bridge is
the best thing that life has to offer.

937
01:32:52,160 --> 01:32:54,116
Old Sam the Lion.

938
01:32:57,000 --> 01:33:00,913
Nobody knows where he got that name.
l gave it to him.

939
01:33:01,600 --> 01:33:02,828
One night...

940
01:33:03,320 --> 01:33:05,470
...itjust came to me.

941
01:33:09,560 --> 01:33:11,471
He was so pleased.

942
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:17,189
l was 22 years old then.

943
01:33:18,560 --> 01:33:19,993
Can you imagine?

944
01:33:24,080 --> 01:33:25,115
lt's terrible...

945
01:33:25,400 --> 01:33:29,109
...to only meet one man in life
that knows what you're worth.

946
01:33:30,800 --> 01:33:31,789
Just terrible.

947
01:33:34,920 --> 01:33:36,319
l've looked too.

948
01:33:38,040 --> 01:33:40,315
You wouldn't believe
how l've looked.

949
01:33:44,920 --> 01:33:47,912
Well, now l know why Sam liked you.

950
01:33:48,200 --> 01:33:49,110
Loved me.

951
01:33:49,360 --> 01:33:50,679
Loved you, l mean.

952
01:33:51,800 --> 01:33:53,074
Do you?

953
01:33:54,520 --> 01:33:57,159
l can kind of see
what he saw in you too.

954
01:34:06,240 --> 01:34:08,310
Nope. l'll just go on home.

955
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:09,908
Go on. Get out.

956
01:34:14,240 --> 01:34:17,312
Think l could learn to drink?

957
01:34:23,640 --> 01:34:26,154
You might.
Better keep on practising.

958
01:34:55,280 --> 01:34:57,430
That Logan boy's a quarterback,
ain't he?

959
01:34:57,720 --> 01:35:00,029
Boy, we've fnally got us a team!

960
01:35:00,400 --> 01:35:02,356
Didn't back in your day, did they?

961
01:35:02,720 --> 01:35:04,119
No, we wasn't much good.

962
01:35:04,480 --> 01:35:06,391
You just never learned
the fundamentals.

963
01:35:06,720 --> 01:35:09,188
You know, blocking and tackling.

964
01:35:09,520 --> 01:35:10,953
Not like this team.

965
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:13,390
When was it you graduated?
Last year.

966
01:35:13,680 --> 01:35:14,669
You don't mean it.

967
01:35:14,960 --> 01:35:17,997
Seems longer than that
since you and Duane played ball.

968
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:19,633
l seen Duane a while ago.

969
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:22,195
He's home on leave,
wearing his uniform.

970
01:35:22,480 --> 01:35:24,311
l ain't seen him yet.

971
01:35:29,720 --> 01:35:31,312
How are you, Chester?
Fine, coach.

972
01:35:31,600 --> 01:35:34,592
See if we can't stretch
that goddamn thing a little.

973
01:35:34,960 --> 01:35:38,839
You know a man never ought to cheat,
unless it's for a good cause.

974
01:35:40,080 --> 01:35:41,877
He's a good old boy, ain't he?

975
01:35:46,720 --> 01:35:51,396
Anarene High School
We love you

976
01:35:51,640 --> 01:35:54,950
Love you
Oh so grand

977
01:35:56,520 --> 01:36:01,389
We will always be so loyal

978
01:36:01,640 --> 01:36:05,519
Loyal to a man

979
01:36:06,240 --> 01:36:10,438
Whether in defeat or victory

980
01:36:10,680 --> 01:36:12,989
We will e'er be true

981
01:36:32,440 --> 01:36:33,839
Hi, Mrs. Jackson.

982
01:36:34,200 --> 01:36:35,110
Duane here?

983
01:36:35,480 --> 01:36:39,359
That's his car out there, ain't it?
He's here if he ain't walked off.

984
01:36:47,080 --> 01:36:48,433
Hi, how you been?

985
01:36:49,040 --> 01:36:50,473
Pretty good.

986
01:36:53,080 --> 01:36:55,548
l been thinking all week
that l'd run into you.

987
01:36:58,240 --> 01:36:59,832
l heard you was going off to Korea.

988
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:02,918
Thought l'd get over here
and see you before you got off.

989
01:37:03,960 --> 01:37:06,918
Glad you did.
l'm taking the bus in the morning.

990
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:15,548
Want to go to the picture show?

991
01:37:16,440 --> 01:37:18,829
Miss Mosey has to close it.
Tonight's the last night.

992
01:37:19,360 --> 01:37:21,112
Yeah, might as well go.

993
01:37:21,400 --> 01:37:24,198
Hate to miss the last night.
Take the Mercury.

994
01:37:24,600 --> 01:37:26,909
Be the last chance l'll have
to drive it for a while.

995
01:37:33,080 --> 01:37:34,399
Ready, Matthew?

996
01:37:34,640 --> 01:37:35,390
All ready.

997
01:38:00,360 --> 01:38:02,157
Take them to Missouri, Matt.

998
01:38:59,280 --> 01:39:00,679
That was a good movie.

999
01:39:00,920 --> 01:39:02,751
Seen it here before once.

1000
01:39:04,000 --> 01:39:06,355
Why don't we run over to Wichita
and drink some beer?

1001
01:39:06,640 --> 01:39:08,915
Okay. l got lots of time
till morning.

1002
01:39:09,200 --> 01:39:10,349
Sure.

1003
01:39:12,160 --> 01:39:13,229
So long, Miss Mosey.

1004
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:14,674
Sorry you're closing the show.

1005
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:17,309
Nobody wants to come
to shows no more.

1006
01:39:17,800 --> 01:39:21,270
Kid baseball in the summer,
television all the time.

1007
01:39:22,840 --> 01:39:26,071
Sam had lived, l believe
we could've kept it going.

1008
01:39:26,600 --> 01:39:28,875
But l just didn't have the know how.

1009
01:39:30,120 --> 01:39:33,078
Won't be much to do in town
with the picture show closed.

1010
01:39:35,680 --> 01:39:37,113
Well, so long.

1011
01:39:38,080 --> 01:39:38,830
Wait.

1012
01:39:40,120 --> 01:39:42,031
You watch out now, overseas.

1013
01:40:04,280 --> 01:40:06,191
Sure weren't no women around.

1014
01:40:09,120 --> 01:40:11,793
l guess the next piece of ass
l get will be yellow.

1015
01:40:12,560 --> 01:40:14,232
l wish l was going with you.

1016
01:40:16,680 --> 01:40:18,398
Why don't you take care
of the car for me?

1017
01:40:18,960 --> 01:40:20,313
Your ma don't need it?

1018
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,518
l wouldn't want her driving it.
No better than she can drive.

1019
01:40:23,760 --> 01:40:25,751
Help her take
the groceries home sometimes.

1020
01:40:39,280 --> 01:40:40,508
You ever....

1021
01:40:40,800 --> 01:40:42,119
You ever hear from Jacy?

1022
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,718
No, not a thing.

1023
01:40:45,000 --> 01:40:48,834
She don't get home much.
Ain't been back to town since August.

1024
01:40:49,160 --> 01:40:50,957
l guess she stays in Dallas
all the time.

1025
01:40:51,680 --> 01:40:53,352
Yeah, probably does.

1026
01:40:54,840 --> 01:40:56,717
l guess there's lots to do in Dallas.

1027
01:41:02,280 --> 01:41:04,191
l ain't over her yet, you know.

1028
01:41:06,480 --> 01:41:08,277
l ain't over her yet.

1029
01:41:09,600 --> 01:41:11,238
lt's the damnedest thing.

1030
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:18,632
That's the only reason you and l
got into it that time, you know.

1031
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,633
Reckon she likes Dallas?

1032
01:41:23,600 --> 01:41:25,158
Hard to say. Maybe she does.

1033
01:41:28,560 --> 01:41:32,394
Reckon you and her would've got it
straighted out if l hadn't butted in?

1034
01:41:35,680 --> 01:41:38,240
No, they'd have annulled me too,
even if we had.

1035
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,237
Y'all never even got
into the motel?

1036
01:41:53,600 --> 01:41:55,989
Better get on before we both freeze.

1037
01:42:05,600 --> 01:42:07,238
Here are the keys.

1038
01:42:08,960 --> 01:42:10,359
So long, buddy.

1039
01:42:12,200 --> 01:42:13,269
Be careful.

1040
01:42:14,160 --> 01:42:15,434
l'll take care of the Mercury.

1041
01:42:15,720 --> 01:42:18,075
See you in a year or two
if l don't get shot.

1042
01:44:00,640 --> 01:44:01,629
The sand was blowing.

1043
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:03,478
l never noticed him.

1044
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:05,119
Figured nobody'd be
in the street.

1045
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:07,675
What was he doing out there?

1046
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,679
He weren't doing nothing.
Just a simple minded kid.

1047
01:44:10,920 --> 01:44:12,399
Never had no sense.
Wasn't your fault.

1048
01:44:12,680 --> 01:44:14,398
Hell, no!
l can see that.

1049
01:44:14,680 --> 01:44:16,193
He wasjust a dumb old kid.

1050
01:44:16,480 --> 01:44:19,313
Didn't know enough to keep his ass
out of the cold.

1051
01:44:19,560 --> 01:44:21,357
Let's go to the cafe.
Ain't had breakfast.

1052
01:44:21,600 --> 01:44:24,319
l'd like to know what
he was doing with that broom.

1053
01:44:24,600 --> 01:44:27,273
He was sweeping, you sons of bitches!

1054
01:44:27,560 --> 01:44:29,152
He was sweeping!

1055
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,835
Y'all got some crazy kids
in this town.

1056
01:48:00,120 --> 01:48:02,509
Could l have
a cup of coffee with you?

1057
01:48:05,320 --> 01:48:06,594
l guess.

1058
01:48:15,160 --> 01:48:17,549
l'm sorry.
l'm still in my bathrobe.

1059
01:48:39,120 --> 01:48:41,236
What am l doing apologizing to you?

1060
01:48:41,480 --> 01:48:44,074
Why am l always apologizing to you,
you little bastard?!

1061
01:48:45,360 --> 01:48:48,272
Three months l've apologized to you
without you even here!

1062
01:48:48,560 --> 01:48:51,870
l haven't done anything wrong.
Why can't l quit apologizing?!

1063
01:48:52,160 --> 01:48:53,559
You ought to be sorry!

1064
01:48:54,080 --> 01:48:57,959
l wouldn't be in my bathrobe if not
for you. l'd have my clothes on.

1065
01:48:58,240 --> 01:49:01,550
You're the one made me quit caring
if l got dressed or not!

1066
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:04,871
Just because
your friend got killed...

1067
01:49:05,160 --> 01:49:08,391
...you want me to forget what you did
and make it all right.

1068
01:49:08,680 --> 01:49:10,636
l'm not sorry for you.

1069
01:49:10,920 --> 01:49:13,229
You'd have left Billy,
just like you left me.

1070
01:49:13,520 --> 01:49:15,397
l bet you left him plenty of nights...

1071
01:49:15,640 --> 01:49:17,392
...whenever Jacy whistled.

1072
01:49:17,680 --> 01:49:19,398
l wouldn't treat a dog that way.

1073
01:49:19,960 --> 01:49:24,078
You thought l was so old and ugly,
you didn't owe me any explanation.

1074
01:49:24,360 --> 01:49:25,873
You didn't need to be careful of me.

1075
01:49:26,160 --> 01:49:29,197
There was nothing l could do about
you and her, so why be careful?

1076
01:49:29,440 --> 01:49:30,475
You didn't love me.

1077
01:49:31,320 --> 01:49:32,355
Look at me.

1078
01:49:34,320 --> 01:49:35,992
Can't you even look at me?

1079
01:49:48,480 --> 01:49:49,549
See?

1080
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,632
Shouldn't have come here.

1081
01:49:53,280 --> 01:49:55,157
l'm around that corner now.

1082
01:49:56,360 --> 01:49:57,679
You've ruined it.

1083
01:49:58,080 --> 01:50:00,116
lt's lost completely.

1084
01:50:02,600 --> 01:50:05,672
Just your needing me
won't make it come back.

1085
01:51:45,960 --> 01:51:48,030
Never you mind, honey.

1086
01:51:48,880 --> 01:51:50,552
Never you mind.
