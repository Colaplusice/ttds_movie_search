70
00:10:44,573 --> 00:10:47,326

* Everybodys goin to the moon

00:10:53,213 --> 00:10:56,410
* How many times, while looking down

73
00:10:56,493 --> 00:10:58,609
* And wondered who we were

74
00:10:58,693 --> 00:11:00,843

* And its got to make you glad to be alive

90

00:24:18,013 --> 00:24:20,891

00:24:20,973 --> 00:24:23,407

00:24:41,293 --> 00:24:44,126
Maybe hes gonna go down

174
00:24:44,213 --> 00:24:46,773
Well, maybe its another drop.

175
00:24:46,853 --> 00:24:49,242
Well, he gets a free ride.

177
00:25:07,853 --> 00:25:09,332

178
00:25:09,413 --> 00:25:11,165
All right, Popeyes here!

00:25:41,573 --> 00:25:43,370

Come here. Dyou pick your feet?

189
00:25:46,173 --> 00:25:49,643
Do you...? Get over there.
Get your hands on your head.

190
00:25:50,053 --> 00:25:53,125
- Hold em up.
- We told you people we were comin back.

191
00:25:53,213 --> 00:25:55,886
Were gonna keep comin back
until you clean this bar up.

192
00:25:55,973 --> 00:25:59,329
Keep your eye on your neighbour.
lf he drops somethin, it belongs to you.

193
00:25:59,413 --> 00:26:02,530
What is this, a fuckin hospital here? Huh?

194
00:26:02,613 --> 00:26:05,411
Turn around there, fella.

Get your hands on your fuckin head.

198
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,772
- You wanna take a ride there, fat man?
- Oh, bullshit.

199
00:26:19,853 --> 00:26:21,286
Huh?

200
00:26:22,013 --> 00:26:25,847
Pay attention.
Were gonna ask questions later.

201
00:26:25,933 --> 00:26:28,242
(Cloudy) Turn around.

202
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,602
All right, shut up there. Shut up!

203
00:26:41,853 --> 00:26:44,526
Anybody want a milkshake?

204
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:53,406
All right, come over here. You and you.

205
00:26:53,493 --> 00:26:56,485
Hey, whiskers! Come over here.

206
00:26:57,053 --> 00:26:59,442

Come on, you, baldie. Come on, move.

208
00:27:03,573 --> 00:27:05,882
All right, put it on the bar.

209
00:27:05,973 --> 00:27:08,282
- Get it on the bar!
- Get the hell in there.

210
00:27:08,373 --> 00:27:10,967
- Put your hands on your head.
- All of it.

211
00:27:12,653 --> 00:27:15,645
Smart ass, you dropped somethin. Pick it up.

212
00:27:18,053 --> 00:27:21,363
You want that hand broken? Get it up there.

213
00:27:21,853 --> 00:27:24,242
What else you got here, huh?

214
00:27:25,733 --> 00:27:27,724
Turn around.

215
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:33,204
Youre under arrest. That goes for you too.

217
00:27:41,853 --> 00:27:43,491
Hey, you!

00:28:14,813 --> 00:28:19,489

229
00:28:20,773 --> 00:28:23,162
This is goddamn full of shit.

00:28:25,413 --> 00:28:28,450
- Hows everything?
- Everythings everything, baby.

231
00:28:28,533 --> 00:28:30,728
Theres nothin out there. lts all milk.

232
00:28:30,813 --> 00:28:35,568
- There aint nothin around. Nobodys holdin.
- l got a name for you. Sal Boca. Brooklyn.

233
00:28:35,653 --> 00:28:38,042
- Boca?
- Yeah. B-O-C-A.

234
00:28:39,253 --> 00:28:42,450
- Never heard of him.
- What about his wife Angie?

235
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:46,003
Doesnt register.
Theres been some talk, though.

236
00:28:46,093 --> 00:28:48,402
- About what?
- A shipment.

237
00:28:48,493 --> 00:28:51,929
Comin in this week, the week after.
Everybodys gonna get well.

238
00:28:52,013 --> 00:28:54,447
- Well, whos bringin it?
- Who knows?

239
00:29:03,493 --> 00:29:06,166

- Huh?

240
00:29:06,253 --> 00:29:09,848
- Where do you want it?
- Oh, shit. This side.

241
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:17,524
Beat it!

242
00:29:18,373 --> 00:29:21,843
lm gonna check on this address.
lfthey dont know you, its your ass.

243
00:29:21,933 --> 00:29:25,642
- l thought l told you to stand there!
- Get that hair down before Saturday.

244
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:27,724
Were goin now. Goodbye!

245
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:34,290
Move ass. Tell everybody
well be back in an hour.

246
00:29:34,813 --> 00:29:37,885
Great, but you belong in
Bedford-Stuyvesant, not Ridgewood.

247
00:29:37,973 --> 00:29:42,569
Why dont you detach us? Give us a shot, at
least till we find out iftheres anything here.

248
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:48,444
Everybody wants Weinstock. Maybe heres
the lead were looking for. We deserve this.

249
00:29:48,533 --> 00:29:52,321
You couldnt burn a three-time loser
with this garbage.

250
00:29:52,413 --> 00:29:57,089
The man has done absolutely nothin.
Youll wind up in an entrapment rap.

251
00:29:57,173 --> 00:30:01,086
Brooklyn is loaded with guys that own
candy stores, two cars and go to nightclubs.

252
00:30:01,173 --> 00:30:04,848
You put this hustler together with Weinstock
and maybe we got a big score.

253
00:30:04,933 --> 00:30:08,403
Big score, my ass! At best
hes sellin nickel-and-dime bags.

254
00:30:08,493 --> 00:30:13,362
l wouldnt be infringin on your coffee break
if l thought it was a nickel-and-dimer.

255
00:30:13,453 --> 00:30:18,766
Your hunches have backfired before, Doyle,
or have you forgotten about that already?

256
00:30:18,853 --> 00:30:21,606
Jesus Christ, Jimmy,
whats happened to you guys?

257
00:30:21,693 --> 00:30:26,130
Every year you lead the narcotic bureau in
arrests. What was it, over 100 again last year?

258
00:30:26,213 --> 00:30:28,932
Terrific. But who? What did you bring in?

259
00:30:29,013 --> 00:30:31,732
A high-school kid in short pants
that had a twitch?

260
00:30:31,813 --> 00:30:35,601
You grab a bellhop because
hes got three joints in his sock?

261
00:30:39,213 --> 00:30:43,206
Walter, we got the information
theres no shit on the street, right?

262
00:30:43,293 --> 00:30:46,251
lts like a desert full ofjunkies
waiting to get well.

263
00:30:46,333 --> 00:30:50,531
Goddamnit, this could be it. This little
candy-store guy, hes put on a big show...

264
00:30:50,613 --> 00:30:54,003
..in a club with no narcotics connections.
They were all over him.

265
00:30:54,093 --> 00:30:57,130
And after working a day and night,
we tail him to Brooklyn.

266
00:30:57,213 --> 00:31:01,843
And we sat on him for practically a week, and
who do we come up with? Joel Weinstock.

267
00:31:01,933 --> 00:31:04,322
Now you gotta let us have it.

268
00:31:05,933 --> 00:31:08,527
Do you believe all this crap?

269
00:31:08,613 --> 00:31:11,002
l go with my partner.

270
00:31:12,893 --> 00:31:14,804
- Whatll it take?
- A wire.

271
00:31:14,893 --> 00:31:18,283
No, two wires.
One on the store, one on the house.

272
00:31:19,533 --> 00:31:22,843
You know l have to get a court order
for a wire tap, dont you?

273
00:31:22,933 --> 00:31:25,925
- But youll try.
- We know you can do it, Walt.

274
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:31,929
Popeye, you still picking your feet
in Poughkeepsie?

275
00:31:35,373 --> 00:31:37,887
Jentends parler de a.
Je narrive pas  y croire.

276
00:31:37,973 --> 00:31:40,043
Alorsje vais un peuparlerpourmoi.

277
00:31:40,133 --> 00:31:45,446
Jai tendance ... penser
 mes propres problmes, enfiin...

278
00:31:47,693 --> 00:31:50,730
Monsieur Devereaux, is this
your first trip to New York?

279
00:31:50,813 --> 00:31:54,169
- Yes, its my first.
- Why did you choose to come by ship?

280
00:31:54,253 --> 00:31:57,245
The next several weeks
will be very difficult for me,...

281
00:31:57,333 --> 00:32:03,249
..and the ocean is the only place where
the telephone isnt ringing all the time.

282
00:32:03,333 --> 00:32:06,325
Do you agree with the recent survey finding...

283
00:32:06,413 --> 00:32:09,962
..that showed that Mayor Lindsay
was the sexiest man in the world?

284
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:12,442
(interpreter translates into French)

285
00:32:16,733 --> 00:32:18,007
Tout fait, oui.

286
00:33:09,813 --> 00:33:13,647
Heres the warrants and the court order
for the wire tap. Judge gave you 60 days.

287
00:33:13,733 --> 00:33:17,442
Mulderig and Kleinll sit in for the feds.
Theyll make all the buys.

288
00:33:17,533 --> 00:33:20,605
Make sure you keep em informed
of everything that goes down.

289
00:33:20,693 --> 00:33:22,923
You know Doyle there, dont you?

290
00:33:23,013 --> 00:33:28,212
Yeah, l know Popeye. His brilliant hunches
cost the life of a good cop.

291
00:33:28,293 --> 00:33:32,411
lfthis is the way youre comin in on this,
why not stay home and save us a lot of grief?

292
00:33:32,493 --> 00:33:35,565
- Because thats my opinion.
- Shove it up your ass.

293
00:33:35,933 --> 00:33:37,491
Whatever.

294
00:33:37,573 --> 00:33:42,124
Bill, do me a favour, give them a chance.
He came in with a little basic information.

295
00:33:42,213 --> 00:33:45,762
You worked with him, had some trouble,
but dont get off on the wrong foot.

296
00:33:45,853 --> 00:33:49,482
- You have any problems, come to me.
- Simonson, just keep off my back.

297
00:33:49,573 --> 00:33:54,089
Just try and cool it with him. lfyou have
any problems, come to me. lll handle him.

298
00:33:54,173 --> 00:33:56,926
- lll be happy to work with him.
- Hes a good cop.

299
00:33:57,013 --> 00:34:01,131
- Hes got good hunches once in a while.
- Fine. Just keep him off my back.

300
00:34:01,213 --> 00:34:05,047

Let yourself in, will you?

312
00:36:20,853 --> 00:36:22,844
What happened?

313
00:36:26,693 --> 00:36:28,684
(Doyle) That crazy kid.

314
00:36:30,493 --> 00:36:32,882
She locked me up with my own cuffs.

315
00:36:34,773 --> 00:36:37,367
- Wheres the keys?
- Over there.

316
00:36:46,013 --> 00:36:48,049
(woman gasps)

317
00:36:48,573 --> 00:36:50,564
Hi there.

318
00:37:03,613 --> 00:37:06,002
Anybody hurt in this wreck?

319
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:14,401
l thought l told you to get
plastic folders for this stuff.

320
00:37:15,053 --> 00:37:17,442
Your scrapbook is like you.

321
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:21,211
- A mess.
- Give me my pants, will you?

322
00:37:24,813 --> 00:37:26,804
Come on.

323
00:37:27,613 --> 00:37:30,491
- Did you get the warrants?
- Yeah.

324
00:37:30,573 --> 00:37:34,327
l also got two feds. Mulderig and Klein.

325
00:37:35,053 --> 00:37:37,806
What do we need those pricks for?

326
00:37:37,893 --> 00:37:41,568
Because our departments got
about 908 bucks to make buys,...

327
00:37:41,653 --> 00:37:45,407
..and they can get all they want
from Uncle Sap. Hello.

328
00:37:47,693 --> 00:37:49,365
These yours, darling?

329
00:38:29,773 --> 00:38:31,365
(whistle)

330
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,486
30 over here for this gentleman. Can l get 35?

331

414
01:00:39,406 --> 01:00:42,603
A deal for half a million dollars? Maybe.

415
01:00:42,686 --> 01:00:44,643
Maybe?

So what do you want, a badge?
This is your first major-league game, Sal.

01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:15,647
Look, lve been damn careful up to now.

424

The boys think we oughta cool it for a while,
just to make sure theres no heat.

455
01:09:46,886 --> 01:09:49,764
You must take me for an imbecile.

01:09:49,846 --> 01:09:52,884
Why do you think l asked you

01:12:19,447 --> 01:12:22,995
Break it up! Will you two break it up?

First they send us to Pier One,

556
01:33:09,166 --> 01:33:11,556
Why did you park the car
down by the waterfront?

557
01:33:11,646 --> 01:33:15,924
Youre staying in midtown Manhattan
and you lose the car by the Brooklyn Bridge?

558
01:33:16,007 --> 01:33:20,046
Monsieur Devereaux is scouting locations
for a film for French television.

559
01:33:20,126 --> 01:33:22,321
He probably left the car to look at something.

560
01:33:22,406 --> 01:33:26,400
We were told by the police commissioner
that the car was brought to this garage.

Unless you wish to see this in his film,
l suggest you locate the car immediately.

567
01:33:47,567 --> 01:33:52,846
Youre in a no-smoking area, sir. Would you
please extinguish your cigarettes?

568
01:34:07,686 --> 01:34:10,884

569
01:34:17,407 --> 01:34:19,398
4795 pounds.

570
01:34:24,686 --> 01:34:27,155
