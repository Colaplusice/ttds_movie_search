1
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,840
Every second bastard born
is fathered by a priest.

2
00:05:28,597 --> 00:05:30,554
But in Utopia that couldn't be.

3
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:31,672
For why?

4
00:05:31,766 --> 00:05:35,135
-For there the priests are very holy.
-Therefore very few.

5
00:05:37,605 --> 00:05:39,846
Is it anything interesting, Matthew?

6
00:05:40,524 --> 00:05:44,022
-Bless you, sir. I don't know.
-Bless you too, Matthew.

7
00:05:49,281 --> 00:05:51,771
To be sure, we have
some holy priests in England.

8
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:54,191
-Oh, name some.
-Brother James.

9
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,612
Man's a simpleton.

10
00:05:58,038 --> 00:05:59,829
It's from Cardinal Wolsey.

11
00:06:01,458 --> 00:06:02,738
What's he want?

12
00:06:03,334 --> 00:06:04,449
-Me.
-When?

13
00:06:04,585 --> 00:06:05,450
Now.

14
00:06:05,628 --> 00:06:08,498
In Hampton Court?
You won't be there by midnight.

15
00:06:09,256 --> 00:06:11,877
-The King's business.
-Queen's business.

16
00:06:12,216 --> 00:06:14,505
Mistress Anne Boleyn's business.

17
00:06:14,635 --> 00:06:17,801
Well, it's all the Cardinal's business.

18
00:06:17,929 --> 00:06:22,140
That's very true. And when the Cardinal
calls, you all come running, day or night.

19
00:06:22,225 --> 00:06:25,225
What is the man? A butcher's son.

20
00:06:25,519 --> 00:06:27,096
Chancellor of England, too.

21
00:06:27,187 --> 00:06:29,678
No, that's his office. What's the man?

22
00:06:30,565 --> 00:06:33,684
Surely, Your Grace,
when a man rises so high and so swiftly...

23
00:06:33,776 --> 00:06:36,646
...we must think he was misplaced
in his origins.

24
00:06:38,154 --> 00:06:40,692
That, at least,
was the opinion of Aristotle and....

25
00:06:41,908 --> 00:06:43,864
A butcher's son and looks it.

26
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,568
His looks, yes, I give you his looks.

27
00:06:48,705 --> 00:06:50,781
What was that you said, Richard?

28
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,950
Nothing, Sir Thomas, it was out of place.

29
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:57,411
And Wolsey's still a butcher.

30
00:06:57,921 --> 00:07:01,420
And you're a member of the King's
High Council, not an errand boy.

31
00:07:01,507 --> 00:07:03,167
That is why I must go.

32
00:07:03,634 --> 00:07:06,303
The Duke would go
if the Cardinal called him.

33
00:07:07,053 --> 00:07:08,251
I might.

34
00:07:10,348 --> 00:07:12,174
I'll be back for breakfast.

35
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:14,214
Go to bed.

36
00:07:15,811 --> 00:07:19,808
"Dear Lord, give us rest tonight,
or if we must be wakeful, cheerful.

37
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:24,399
"Careful only for our soul's salvation.
For Christ's sake. Amen."

38
00:07:25,777 --> 00:07:27,686
And bless our lord, the King.

39
00:07:28,696 --> 00:07:31,365
-"And bless our lord, the King."
-Amen!

40
00:07:31,448 --> 00:07:34,200
Excuse me, gentlemen.
Goodnight, Your Grace.

41
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:42,116
Keep clear of Wolsey, Thomas.
He's a frightened man.

42
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:47,127
-Who is that?
-A young friend from Cambridge.

43
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,337
-What's he want?
-What do they all want? A position.

44
00:07:50,548 --> 00:07:53,548
-Can you give him a position?
-Do you recommend him?

45
00:07:54,176 --> 00:07:55,207
No.

46
00:08:12,816 --> 00:08:14,808
-Sir Thomas.
-No.

47
00:08:15,443 --> 00:08:17,601
-Did you recommend me?
-No.

48
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:22,146
Richard, I may have a position for you.

49
00:08:22,282 --> 00:08:26,409
-What? What position?
-Not now, Richard. Tomorrow.

50
00:09:08,278 --> 00:09:09,856
For you all, boatman.

51
00:09:10,572 --> 00:09:11,900
Thank you, sir.

52
00:09:33,216 --> 00:09:36,169
Sir Thomas is here, Your Grace.
Sir Thomas.

53
00:09:36,677 --> 00:09:38,052
Master Cromwell.

54
00:09:52,607 --> 00:09:56,105
You opposed me in the Council
this morning, Thomas.

55
00:09:56,944 --> 00:09:58,319
Yes, Your Grace.

56
00:09:59,237 --> 00:10:02,403
-You were the only one.
-Yes, Your Grace.

57
00:10:03,824 --> 00:10:05,069
You're a fool.

58
00:10:06,493 --> 00:10:09,280
Thank God there is only one fool
on the Council.

59
00:10:13,082 --> 00:10:14,991
Why did you oppose me?

60
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:17,998
I thought Your Grace was wrong.

61
00:10:19,629 --> 00:10:21,337
A matter of conscience.

62
00:10:23,507 --> 00:10:25,879
You're a constant regret to me, Thomas.

63
00:10:26,676 --> 00:10:29,167
If you could just see facts flat on...

64
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,428
...without that horrible moral squint.

65
00:10:33,641 --> 00:10:37,175
With a little common sense,
you could have made a statesman.

66
00:10:43,690 --> 00:10:44,769
The King.

67
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:15,005
Where's he been? Do you know?

68
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,295
I, Your Grace?

69
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:20,295
Spare me your discretion.

70
00:11:21,722 --> 00:11:25,719
He's been to play in the muck again.

71
00:11:27,977 --> 00:11:30,135
He's been to Mistress Anne Boleyn.

72
00:11:35,817 --> 00:11:39,600
More, are you going to help me?

73
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,901
If Your Grace will be specific.

74
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,283
You're a plodder! All right, we'll plod.

75
00:11:49,953 --> 00:11:53,120
The King wants a son.
What are you going to do about it?

76
00:11:53,373 --> 00:11:57,417
I'm very sure the King needs no advice
from me on what to do about it.

77
00:11:58,252 --> 00:12:01,703
Thomas, we're alone.
I give you my word, there's no one here.

78
00:12:01,797 --> 00:12:04,204
I didn't suppose there was, Your Grace.

79
00:12:07,802 --> 00:12:11,501
Do you favour a change of dynasty?
Do you think two Tudors are sufficient?

80
00:12:11,596 --> 00:12:12,794
For God's sake, Your Grace!

81
00:12:12,889 --> 00:12:16,388
Then he needs a son. I repeat,
what are you going to do about it?

82
00:12:16,517 --> 00:12:17,762
I pray for it daily.

83
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:20,140
God's death, he means it.

84
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:24,187
That thing out there, at least she's fertile.

85
00:12:25,024 --> 00:12:27,645
-But she's not his wife.
-No, Catherine's his wife...

86
00:12:27,735 --> 00:12:31,103
...and she's barren as a brick.
Are you going to pray for a miracle?

87
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,773
There are precedents.

88
00:12:36,784 --> 00:12:40,366
All right. Good. Pray by all means.

89
00:12:41,663 --> 00:12:47,249
But in addition to prayer there is effort.
And my effort is to secure a divorce.

90
00:12:50,879 --> 00:12:53,167
Have I your support, or have I not?

91
00:12:56,717 --> 00:13:00,584
The Pope gave a dispensation,
so that the King might marry...

92
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,293
...his brother's widow for state reasons.

93
00:13:04,015 --> 00:13:09,388
We are to ask the Pope to dispense with
his dispensation, also for state reasons?

94
00:13:09,477 --> 00:13:11,635
I don't like plodding, Thomas. Well?

95
00:13:11,729 --> 00:13:15,940
Then, clearly all we have to do is
to approach His Holiness and ask him.

96
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:19,191
I think we might influence
the decision of His Holiness.

97
00:13:19,944 --> 00:13:21,023
By argument?

98
00:13:21,112 --> 00:13:24,979
Argument certainly. And pressure.

99
00:13:26,283 --> 00:13:30,529
Pressure, applied to the Church?
The Church has its church property.

100
00:13:32,622 --> 00:13:33,784
Pressure.

101
00:13:40,461 --> 00:13:43,960
No, Your Grace, I'm not going to help you.

102
00:13:46,842 --> 00:13:50,091
Then goodnight, Master More.

103
00:13:53,430 --> 00:13:58,341
Let the dynasty die with Henry Vlll
and we'll have dynastic wars again.

104
00:13:58,685 --> 00:14:01,887
Blood-witted barons ramping the country
from end to end.

105
00:14:02,730 --> 00:14:06,312
Is that what you want? Very well.

106
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,357
England needs an heir.

107
00:14:10,778 --> 00:14:15,107
Certain measures, perhaps regrettable...

108
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:19,738
...perhaps not, there's much in the Church
which needs reformation, Thomas.

109
00:14:21,954 --> 00:14:26,033
All right, regrettable.
But necessary to get us an heir.

110
00:14:28,293 --> 00:14:32,290
Now, explain how you, as a councillor
of England, can obstruct these measures...

111
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:35,249
...for the sake
of your own private conscience.

112
00:14:37,383 --> 00:14:41,167
I think that when statesmen forsake
their own private conscience...

113
00:14:41,303 --> 00:14:43,841
...for the sake of their public duties...

114
00:14:43,972 --> 00:14:47,637
...they lead their country
by a short route to chaos.

115
00:14:51,645 --> 00:14:54,314
And we shall have my prayers
to fall back on.

116
00:14:55,023 --> 00:14:59,234
You'd like that, wouldn't you?
To govern the country with prayers?

117
00:14:59,777 --> 00:15:01,022
Yes, I should.

118
00:15:01,862 --> 00:15:04,020
I'd like to be there when you try.

119
00:15:06,366 --> 00:15:08,274
Who will wear this after me?

120
00:15:09,868 --> 00:15:14,280
Who's our next chancellor?
You? Fisher? Suffolk?

121
00:15:14,748 --> 00:15:16,906
-Fisher for me.
-Aye, but for the King?

122
00:15:17,333 --> 00:15:20,536
What about my secretary,
Master Cromwell?

123
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:25,255
Cromwell. He's a very able man.

124
00:15:26,716 --> 00:15:27,546
But?

125
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,589
Me rather than Cromwell.

126
00:15:31,386 --> 00:15:33,379
Then, come down to earth.

127
00:15:36,224 --> 00:15:37,468
Until you do...

128
00:15:39,935 --> 00:15:41,844
...you and I are enemies.

129
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,272
As Your Grace wishes.

130
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,602
As God wills.

131
00:15:50,277 --> 00:15:51,819
Perhaps, Your Grace.

132
00:15:53,696 --> 00:15:56,862
More! You should have been a cleric!

133
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,491
Like yourself, Your Grace?

134
00:16:13,421 --> 00:16:15,045
Goodnight, Sir Thomas.

135
00:16:22,178 --> 00:16:23,293
Sir Thomas.

136
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:25,342
Sir Thomas.

137
00:16:26,473 --> 00:16:27,636
Sir Thomas.

138
00:16:29,976 --> 00:16:33,226
-What's this?
-From some grateful poor folk, in Leicester.

139
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,229
-Leicester?
-You do more good than you know, sir.

140
00:16:39,442 --> 00:16:43,605
My daughter has a case, sir,
in the Court of Poor Man's Causes.

141
00:16:45,364 --> 00:16:46,822
Baked apples, sir.

142
00:16:47,407 --> 00:16:49,115
To sweeten my judgement.

143
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:53,236
I'll give your daughter the same judgement
I would give my own.

144
00:16:53,329 --> 00:16:55,736
A fair one, quickly.

145
00:16:56,165 --> 00:16:57,362
Bless you, sir.

146
00:16:57,457 --> 00:17:01,122
I understand. Yes. I'll read it.
Yes. Thank you.

147
00:17:06,840 --> 00:17:08,583
Good evening, Sir Thomas.

148
00:17:09,551 --> 00:17:11,792
-I'll read it.
-It's an awkward case.

149
00:17:11,886 --> 00:17:14,174
-I could illuminate it for you--
-I'll read it.

150
00:17:14,263 --> 00:17:15,887
Just a moment or two....

151
00:17:17,974 --> 00:17:19,005
Boat!

152
00:17:19,642 --> 00:17:20,176
Sir?

153
00:17:42,911 --> 00:17:44,026
Chelsea, sir?

154
00:17:44,121 --> 00:17:45,152
Chelsea.

155
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:48,238
I expect you'll make it worth my while, sir.

156
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:51,748
-You've got a licence?
-Bless you, yes sir, I've got a licence.

157
00:17:51,835 --> 00:17:54,408
-Well then, the fares are fixed.
-They are, sir.

158
00:17:54,546 --> 00:17:57,167
Hampton to Chelsea downstream,
a penny halfpenny.

159
00:17:57,257 --> 00:17:59,415
Chelsea to Hampton upstream,
a penny halfpenny.

160
00:17:59,508 --> 00:18:01,964
Whoever makes the regulations
doesn't row a boat.

161
00:18:02,469 --> 00:18:06,003
No. Threepence if you get me home
for breakfast.

162
00:18:06,097 --> 00:18:07,377
Thank you, sir.

163
00:18:35,497 --> 00:18:36,872
A nice cup, sir.

164
00:18:38,708 --> 00:18:39,621
Yes.

165
00:18:57,306 --> 00:18:59,014
That's worth money, sir.

166
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,036
Mind a way, sir.

167
00:19:44,679 --> 00:19:45,959
Thank you, sir.

168
00:19:53,186 --> 00:19:55,392
-Have you been here all night?
-Yes.

169
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:59,305
You said there was a post?

170
00:19:59,941 --> 00:20:05,361
Yes. I'll offer you a post, with a house,
a servant and 50 a year.

171
00:20:05,696 --> 00:20:06,810
What post?

172
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:09,232
At the new school.

173
00:20:12,118 --> 00:20:13,232
A teacher!

174
00:20:14,245 --> 00:20:17,328
Richard, no one's going to give you
a place at court.

175
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,531
Master Cromwell says
he'll do something for me.

176
00:20:23,252 --> 00:20:24,283
Cromwell?

177
00:20:25,671 --> 00:20:28,292
Well, if you know Cromwell
you don't need my help.

178
00:20:29,757 --> 00:20:30,920
Sir Thomas?

179
00:20:33,552 --> 00:20:37,466
If only you knew how much,
much rather, I had your help than his.

180
00:20:39,557 --> 00:20:41,300
Not to a place at court.

181
00:20:42,226 --> 00:20:43,305
Why not?

182
00:20:45,771 --> 00:20:46,684
Look.

183
00:20:48,231 --> 00:20:50,804
-What is it?
-It's a bribe!

184
00:20:53,569 --> 00:20:56,688
"l am the gift of Averil Machin."

185
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:01,358
And Averil Machin has a lawsuit
in the Court of Requests.

186
00:21:02,243 --> 00:21:06,987
Italian silver. Take it. No joke.

187
00:21:09,624 --> 00:21:10,738
Thank you.

188
00:21:13,877 --> 00:21:15,371
What will you do with it?

189
00:21:16,171 --> 00:21:16,835
Sell it.

190
00:21:16,921 --> 00:21:19,246
-And buy what?
-A decent gown!

191
00:21:20,466 --> 00:21:22,672
But Richard, that's a little bribe.

192
00:21:23,427 --> 00:21:28,882
At court they offer you all sorts of things,
home, manor houses, coats of arms.

193
00:21:29,599 --> 00:21:32,136
A man should go
where he won't be tempted.

194
00:21:33,185 --> 00:21:38,012
Why not be a teacher? You'd be
a fine teacher. Perhaps a great one.

195
00:21:39,148 --> 00:21:43,690
-lf I was, who would know it?
-You! Your pupils. Your friends.

196
00:21:44,069 --> 00:21:46,856
God. Not a bad public, that.

197
00:21:50,866 --> 00:21:52,740
And a quiet life.

198
00:21:53,076 --> 00:21:55,993
You say that.
You come from talking with the Cardinal.

199
00:21:56,079 --> 00:21:58,486
Yes, talking with the Cardinal.

200
00:21:59,748 --> 00:22:03,247
It's eating your heart out, isn't it?
The high affairs of state.

201
00:22:03,335 --> 00:22:04,533
The divorce?

202
00:22:05,837 --> 00:22:06,999
Boatman!

203
00:22:07,505 --> 00:22:08,370
Sir?

204
00:22:08,506 --> 00:22:11,127
-Take this gentleman to the New lnn!
-Right, sir.

205
00:22:11,216 --> 00:22:12,591
Sir Thomas?

206
00:22:13,635 --> 00:22:14,749
Thank you.

207
00:22:16,179 --> 00:22:17,803
Be a teacher.

208
00:22:28,314 --> 00:22:29,227
-Matthew.
-Sir.

209
00:22:29,315 --> 00:22:31,223
-Lady Alice in bed?
-Yes, sir.

210
00:22:31,733 --> 00:22:33,275
-Lady Margaret?
-No, sir.

211
00:22:33,735 --> 00:22:35,644
The Master Roper's here, sir.

212
00:22:35,736 --> 00:22:37,693
At this hour? Who let him in?

213
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:40,647
He's a hard man to keep out, sir.

214
00:23:04,135 --> 00:23:06,211
Will wants to marry me, Father.

215
00:23:07,096 --> 00:23:08,803
Well, he can't marry you.

216
00:23:10,307 --> 00:23:12,299
Sir Thomas, I'm called to the Bar.

217
00:23:12,392 --> 00:23:15,013
Oh, congratulations, Roper.

218
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,724
My family may not be at the palace,
but in the city--

219
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:20,263
There's nothing wrong
with your family, Will.

220
00:23:22,066 --> 00:23:24,142
There's not much wrong with you.

221
00:23:25,361 --> 00:23:27,436
Except you seem to need a clock.

222
00:23:28,113 --> 00:23:29,821
I can buy a clock, sir.

223
00:23:30,073 --> 00:23:31,615
Roper, the answer is no...

224
00:23:31,699 --> 00:23:34,272
...and will be no as long as you're a heretic.

225
00:23:34,368 --> 00:23:36,610
Now, that's a word I don't like,
Sir Thomas!

226
00:23:36,703 --> 00:23:38,660
It's not a likeable word or thing.

227
00:23:38,747 --> 00:23:42,364
The Church is heretical!
Dr. Luther's proved that to my satisfaction!

228
00:23:42,458 --> 00:23:44,201
Luther is an excommunicate!

229
00:23:44,293 --> 00:23:47,210
From a heretic Church!
Church? It's a shop!

230
00:23:47,504 --> 00:23:50,872
-Salvation by the shilling! And divorces!
-Will, no!

231
00:23:51,049 --> 00:23:54,168
-What I know, I'll say!
-You've no sense of the place!

232
00:23:55,344 --> 00:23:57,135
He's no sense of the time.

233
00:23:57,721 --> 00:23:59,345
Now listen well.

234
00:23:59,722 --> 00:24:02,260
Two years ago you were
a passionate churchman.

235
00:24:02,350 --> 00:24:04,306
Now you're a passionate Lutheran.

236
00:24:04,393 --> 00:24:07,429
We must just pray
that when your head's finished turning...

237
00:24:07,521 --> 00:24:09,727
...your face is to the front again.

238
00:24:11,774 --> 00:24:14,395
-ls your horse here?
-No, sir, I walked.

239
00:24:15,402 --> 00:24:18,153
Well, take a horse from the stables
and get back home.

240
00:24:20,073 --> 00:24:21,104
Go along.

241
00:24:22,741 --> 00:24:24,152
May I come again?

242
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:28,451
Yes. Soon.

243
00:24:34,001 --> 00:24:35,625
Is that final, Father?

244
00:24:35,877 --> 00:24:38,712
As long as he's a heretic, Meg,
that's absolute.

245
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:44,376
What did Wolsey want?

246
00:24:47,637 --> 00:24:49,214
Nice boy, young Will.

247
00:24:51,557 --> 00:24:53,964
Terribly strong principles, though.

248
00:24:55,060 --> 00:24:56,554
Clumsy, too.

249
00:24:57,353 --> 00:25:00,188
-You're very pensive.
-You're very gay.

250
00:25:00,773 --> 00:25:02,267
Was it the divorce?

251
00:25:03,942 --> 00:25:04,973
To bed.

252
00:25:05,902 --> 00:25:10,279
They're a cantankerous lot, the Ropers.
Always swimming against the stream.

253
00:25:10,489 --> 00:25:12,647
Old Roper was just the same--

254
00:25:14,201 --> 00:25:16,276
You don't want to talk about it.

255
00:25:17,203 --> 00:25:18,116
No.

256
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:26,998
-I'm sorry you were awakened, chick.
-I wasn't sleeping very deeply.

257
00:25:27,462 --> 00:25:29,039
What did Wolsey want?

258
00:25:31,215 --> 00:25:33,836
-Will Roper's been.
-Will Roper?

259
00:25:34,092 --> 00:25:36,962
Yes, he's been here all night.
He wants to marry Meg.

260
00:25:37,053 --> 00:25:39,590
-Why you don't beat that girl l--
-No.

261
00:25:40,139 --> 00:25:43,756
She's full of education
and it's a delicate commodity.

262
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,756
Goodnight, Meg.

263
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,175
Goodnight.

264
00:25:51,356 --> 00:25:54,191
Marry Meg. A lawyer's son.

265
00:25:54,275 --> 00:25:56,102
Well, she's a lawyer's daughter.

266
00:25:59,530 --> 00:26:03,858
Norfolk spoke of you
for Chancellor of England before he left.

267
00:26:04,742 --> 00:26:06,651
Well, he's a dangerous friend then.

268
00:26:07,745 --> 00:26:09,903
Wolsey's chancellor, God help him.

269
00:26:10,205 --> 00:26:12,363
But Norfolk said, if Wolsey fell, you--

270
00:26:12,457 --> 00:26:16,406
If Wolsey fell, the splash would swamp
a few small boats like ours.

271
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:17,950
No.

272
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:21,546
There'll be no new chancellors
while Wolsey lives.

273
00:27:11,714 --> 00:27:14,419
The Duke of Norfolk,
Earl Marshal of England.

274
00:27:29,104 --> 00:27:31,428
Have you any message for His Majesty?

275
00:27:33,899 --> 00:27:35,523
If I had served God...

276
00:27:35,943 --> 00:27:38,694
...one half so well as I've served my King...

277
00:27:39,904 --> 00:27:44,150
...God would not have left me here,
to die in this place.

278
00:27:45,951 --> 00:27:49,900
Thank God you're dying here.
The King would have you die in the Tower.

279
00:28:14,182 --> 00:28:17,218
"l am straightly charged
by the King himself...

280
00:28:18,019 --> 00:28:21,637
"...here openly to declare
how much all England...

281
00:28:21,772 --> 00:28:23,930
"...is beholden to this man.

282
00:28:24,358 --> 00:28:29,184
"And how worthy he is
to have the highest room in the realm.

283
00:28:29,695 --> 00:28:33,692
"And how dearly
the King's grace doth love and trust him...

284
00:28:34,658 --> 00:28:36,983
"...not only for much good council...

285
00:28:37,410 --> 00:28:41,028
"...deliberate council,
but for better council yet...

286
00:28:41,789 --> 00:28:44,493
"...that which is privy to the King's person.

287
00:28:45,667 --> 00:28:47,742
"This same Sir Thomas More...

288
00:28:48,044 --> 00:28:50,795
"...here made before you all to be...

289
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:54,167
"...Lord Chancellor of the Realm."

290
00:30:33,756 --> 00:30:35,298
Calm yourself, Matthew.

291
00:30:35,382 --> 00:30:37,042
Fetch Lady Alice.

292
00:30:49,436 --> 00:30:51,143
That's very well.

293
00:30:55,649 --> 00:30:57,476
My lady! The King!

294
00:32:02,871 --> 00:32:05,029
Now remember, the visit's a surprise.

295
00:32:05,123 --> 00:32:06,996
But he'll know we're expecting him--

296
00:32:07,083 --> 00:32:09,834
It's a very great honour.
One friend calling on another.

297
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,578
What's he really coming for?

298
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,042
To talk about the divorce.
He wants an answer.

299
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:16,586
-But he's had his answer.
-He wants another.

300
00:32:16,674 --> 00:32:17,670
Thomas!

301
00:32:25,056 --> 00:32:28,970
Your Majesty does my house more honour
than I fear my household will bear.

302
00:32:29,059 --> 00:32:31,265
No ceremony Thomas, no ceremony!

303
00:32:31,395 --> 00:32:33,968
A passing fancy.
I happened to be on the river.

304
00:32:34,064 --> 00:32:35,392
Look. Mud.

305
00:32:39,401 --> 00:32:42,402
By heaven, what an evening.

306
00:32:43,363 --> 00:32:46,280
Lady Alice,
I fear we came upon you unexpectedly.

307
00:32:46,365 --> 00:32:48,938
Yes, Your Grace. Well, no, Your Grace.

308
00:32:49,243 --> 00:32:51,484
Well, that is, we are ready to entertain--

309
00:32:51,578 --> 00:32:53,985
This is my daughter Margaret, sire.

310
00:32:55,748 --> 00:32:58,583
She's not yet had the honour
to meet Your Grace.

311
00:32:58,792 --> 00:33:01,912
Why Margaret,
they told me you were a scholar.

312
00:33:02,712 --> 00:33:04,420
Answer, Margaret.

313
00:33:04,631 --> 00:33:07,382
Among women, I pass for one, Your Grace.

314
00:33:38,408 --> 00:33:40,151
Can you dance, too?

315
00:33:40,869 --> 00:33:42,446
Not well, Your Grace.

316
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:46,738
Well, I dance superlatively!

317
00:33:47,666 --> 00:33:50,073
That's a dancer's leg, Margaret!

318
00:34:03,179 --> 00:34:05,420
Lady Alice,
the river's given me an appetite.

319
00:34:05,514 --> 00:34:08,680
If Your Grace would share
a very simple supper.

320
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:10,842
It would please me. Lead them in.

321
00:34:10,935 --> 00:34:12,394
Thomas and I will follow.

322
00:34:12,478 --> 00:34:13,853
Matthew.

323
00:34:14,271 --> 00:34:16,560
My lords and gentlemen!

324
00:34:22,195 --> 00:34:23,475
Margaret?

325
00:34:23,779 --> 00:34:25,154
Your Grace?

326
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,863
Do you like music?

327
00:34:26,990 --> 00:34:28,567
Yes, Your Grace.

328
00:34:29,075 --> 00:34:30,902
They'll play to you.

329
00:34:54,555 --> 00:34:57,045
Now, listen to this.

330
00:34:59,809 --> 00:35:01,137
Sit down.

331
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,225
Be seated. No courtship, Thomas.

332
00:35:09,609 --> 00:35:11,897
You're my friend, are you not?

333
00:35:12,444 --> 00:35:13,475
Your Majesty.

334
00:35:13,570 --> 00:35:16,108
Thank God I have a friend
for my chancellor.

335
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:19,233
Readier to befriend, I trust,
than he was to be chancellor.

336
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,531
My own knowledge of my poor abilities--

337
00:35:21,619 --> 00:35:23,907
I will judge of your abilities.

338
00:35:24,830 --> 00:35:25,861
Thomas?

339
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:31,917
You know that Wolsey named you
for chancellor?

340
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:37,214
Before he died, Wolsey named you,
and Wolsey was no fool.

341
00:35:37,799 --> 00:35:41,416
He was a statesman
of incomparable ability, Your Grace.

342
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:44,965
Was he?

343
00:35:46,389 --> 00:35:47,764
Was he so?

344
00:35:48,849 --> 00:35:50,889
Then, why did he fail me?

345
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,346
It was villainy then.

346
00:35:55,939 --> 00:35:58,346
Yes, villainy. Secret opposition, secret.

347
00:35:58,441 --> 00:36:01,856
But deliberate, wilful,
meditated opposition.

348
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:04,481
Wanted to be pope to master me, Wolsey.

349
00:36:04,571 --> 00:36:06,065
What is it? Thought!

350
00:36:06,155 --> 00:36:10,615
Because I'm simple and plain and deal
with every man straightforwardly.

351
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:14,614
Because of that I say,
do they take me for a simpleton?

352
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:24,375
Wolsey was a proud man, Thomas.

353
00:36:25,463 --> 00:36:27,040
Pride right through.

354
00:36:27,298 --> 00:36:28,708
And he failed me.

355
00:36:29,883 --> 00:36:33,216
Failed me in the one thing that matters,
then as now.

356
00:36:37,014 --> 00:36:38,129
But look.

357
00:36:39,099 --> 00:36:40,262
Be seated.

358
00:36:45,646 --> 00:36:47,021
What an evening.

359
00:36:48,232 --> 00:36:50,354
A man could fight a lion.

360
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,898
Some men could, Your Grace.

361
00:36:54,237 --> 00:36:55,399
Thomas...

362
00:36:56,530 --> 00:36:59,199
...touching this matter of my divorce.

363
00:36:59,616 --> 00:37:01,858
Have you thought of it
since we last spoke?

364
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:03,030
Of little else.

365
00:37:03,119 --> 00:37:04,992
Then you see your way clear to me?

366
00:37:05,079 --> 00:37:07,949
That you should put away
Queen Catherine, sire?

367
00:37:08,207 --> 00:37:10,282
Alas, as I think of it, I see so clearly...

368
00:37:10,375 --> 00:37:13,494
...that I cannot come with Your Grace,
that my endeavour is...

369
00:37:13,586 --> 00:37:14,961
...not to think of it at all.

370
00:37:15,046 --> 00:37:17,453
Then you haven't thought enough!

371
00:37:24,637 --> 00:37:25,835
Lilac.

372
00:37:27,389 --> 00:37:29,097
We have them at Hampton.

373
00:37:30,016 --> 00:37:31,843
Not so fine as this, though.

374
00:37:34,186 --> 00:37:36,724
I'm in an excellent frame of mind.

375
00:37:41,401 --> 00:37:45,184
Thomas, you must consider,
I stand in peril of my soul.

376
00:37:45,279 --> 00:37:46,773
It was no marriage.

377
00:37:47,322 --> 00:37:50,488
I have lived in incest
with my brother's widow.

378
00:37:51,451 --> 00:37:56,491
Leviticus: "Thou shalt not uncover
the nakedness of thy brother's wife."

379
00:37:56,580 --> 00:37:58,905
Leviticus. Chapter 18, verse 16.

380
00:37:58,998 --> 00:38:00,872
Yes, Your Grace. But Deuteronomy--

381
00:38:00,958 --> 00:38:02,951
Deuteronomy is ambiguous!

382
00:38:03,043 --> 00:38:05,712
Your Grace, I'm not fitted
to meddle in these matters.

383
00:38:05,796 --> 00:38:07,918
To me, it seems a matter for the Holy See--

384
00:38:08,006 --> 00:38:11,754
Thomas, does a man need a pope
to tell him where he's sinned?

385
00:38:13,427 --> 00:38:14,921
It was a sin.

386
00:38:15,762 --> 00:38:17,505
God's punished me.

387
00:38:18,515 --> 00:38:19,973
I've no son.

388
00:38:21,434 --> 00:38:23,260
Son after son she's borne me.

389
00:38:23,352 --> 00:38:26,352
All dead at birth, or dead within the month.

390
00:38:26,521 --> 00:38:29,225
I never saw the hand of God
so clear in anything.

391
00:38:29,315 --> 00:38:31,473
It's my bounden duty
to put away the Queen.

392
00:38:31,567 --> 00:38:35,149
And all the popes, back to Peter,
shall not come between me and my duty!

393
00:38:37,697 --> 00:38:40,188
How is it that you cannot see?
Everyone else does.

394
00:38:40,283 --> 00:38:43,402
Then, why does Your Grace
need my poor support?

395
00:38:43,911 --> 00:38:45,321
Because you're honest.

396
00:38:45,829 --> 00:38:48,663
And what is more to the purpose,
you're known to be honest.

397
00:38:48,748 --> 00:38:51,285
Those like Norfolk follow me
because I wear the crown.

398
00:38:51,375 --> 00:38:54,826
Those like Cromwell follow
because they're jackals with sharp teeth...

399
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:57,126
...and I'm their tiger. A mass follows me...

400
00:38:57,213 --> 00:38:59,170
...because it follows anything that moves.

401
00:39:01,717 --> 00:39:02,962
And then there's you.

402
00:39:04,928 --> 00:39:08,592
I am sick to think
how much I must displease Your Grace.

403
00:39:09,223 --> 00:39:12,923
No, Thomas, I respect your sincerity.

404
00:39:16,271 --> 00:39:17,895
But respect...

405
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:21,309
...man, that's water in the desert.

406
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:28,273
How'd you like our music?

407
00:39:28,364 --> 00:39:30,486
That air they played, it had a certain....

408
00:39:30,574 --> 00:39:33,065
Well, tell me what you thought of it.

409
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:35,401
Could it have been Your Grace's own?

410
00:39:35,787 --> 00:39:36,949
Discovered!

411
00:39:37,788 --> 00:39:40,742
Now I'll never know your true opinion,
and that's irksome.

412
00:39:40,832 --> 00:39:44,283
Well, we artists, we love praise,
yet we love truth better.

413
00:39:44,502 --> 00:39:46,874
-Then I will tell my true opinion.
-Well?

414
00:39:46,963 --> 00:39:50,165
To me it seemed delightful.

415
00:39:52,092 --> 00:39:56,303
Thomas, I chose the right man
for chancellor.

416
00:39:56,387 --> 00:40:00,633
I should in fairness add that my taste
in music is reputedly deplorable.

417
00:40:01,475 --> 00:40:03,716
Your taste in music is excellent!

418
00:40:03,810 --> 00:40:06,016
It exactly coincides with my own.

419
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,638
Music.

420
00:40:13,234 --> 00:40:14,514
Music.

421
00:40:15,528 --> 00:40:19,739
Send them back without me, Thomas.
I'll live here in Chelsea and make music.

422
00:40:19,823 --> 00:40:22,029
My house is at Your Grace's disposal.

423
00:40:22,117 --> 00:40:24,607
Touching this other business, mark you...

424
00:40:26,996 --> 00:40:28,904
...I'll have no opposition.

425
00:40:30,665 --> 00:40:32,076
Your Grace.

426
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:36,413
No opposition, I say. No opposition.

427
00:40:37,379 --> 00:40:38,754
Be seated.

428
00:40:41,799 --> 00:40:46,259
I'll leave you out of it
but you are my chancellor.

429
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:51,510
I don't take it kindly
and I'll have no opposition!

430
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:55,891
I see how it will be.

431
00:40:57,104 --> 00:40:59,262
The bishops will oppose me!

432
00:40:59,689 --> 00:41:04,315
The full-fed princes of the Church!
Hypocrites! All hypocrites!

433
00:41:04,485 --> 00:41:06,810
Mind they do not take you in, Thomas!

434
00:41:06,945 --> 00:41:08,523
Your Grace is unjust.

435
00:41:08,613 --> 00:41:11,733
If I cannot serve Your Grace
in this great matter of the Queen.

436
00:41:11,824 --> 00:41:14,196
I have no queen!

437
00:41:14,868 --> 00:41:16,908
Catherine's not my wife!

438
00:41:17,662 --> 00:41:19,785
No priest can make her so.

439
00:41:20,498 --> 00:41:24,198
They that say she is my wife
are not only liars, but traitors!

440
00:41:26,211 --> 00:41:27,753
Yes, traitors!

441
00:41:28,588 --> 00:41:30,379
That I will not brook now!

442
00:41:31,007 --> 00:41:32,169
Treachery!

443
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,498
I will not brook.

444
00:41:34,593 --> 00:41:35,921
It maddens me!

445
00:41:36,344 --> 00:41:41,930
It is a deadly canker in the body politic,
and I will have it out!

446
00:41:51,774 --> 00:41:52,888
See?

447
00:41:55,068 --> 00:41:57,357
You see how you've maddened me?

448
00:41:57,946 --> 00:42:00,234
I hardly know myself.

449
00:42:08,079 --> 00:42:11,163
If you could come with me,
there's no man I'd sooner raise...

450
00:42:11,248 --> 00:42:13,122
...yes, with my own hand.

451
00:42:13,458 --> 00:42:15,534
Your Grace overwhelms me.

452
00:42:25,468 --> 00:42:26,927
What's that?

453
00:42:27,428 --> 00:42:29,088
Eight o'clock, Your Grace.

454
00:42:31,098 --> 00:42:32,971
Lift yourself up, man.

455
00:42:36,936 --> 00:42:39,640
Have I not promised I'll leave you out of it?

456
00:42:41,273 --> 00:42:42,553
Shall we eat?

457
00:42:42,691 --> 00:42:44,315
If Your Grace pleases.

458
00:42:48,654 --> 00:42:50,196
Eight o'clock, you said.

459
00:42:51,782 --> 00:42:53,525
The tide will be turning.

460
00:42:53,909 --> 00:42:57,075
-I was forgetting the tide. I must go.
-I'm sorry, Your Grace.

461
00:42:57,578 --> 00:43:00,532
If I don't catch the tide
I'll not get back to Richmond.

462
00:43:00,622 --> 00:43:02,164
No, don't come.

463
00:43:05,752 --> 00:43:09,416
Lady Alice, I must go and catch the tide.
Affairs call me to court.

464
00:43:09,505 --> 00:43:12,174
So we give you our thanks
and we say goodnight!

465
00:43:34,525 --> 00:43:35,806
What's this?

466
00:43:36,402 --> 00:43:38,275
-You crossed him!
-Somewhat.

467
00:43:38,362 --> 00:43:40,484
-Why?
-I couldn't find the other way.

468
00:43:40,572 --> 00:43:42,611
You're too nice altogether, Thomas.

469
00:43:42,699 --> 00:43:46,198
-Woman, mind your house!
-I am minding my house!

470
00:43:49,538 --> 00:43:51,447
God save Your Majesty!

471
00:43:52,790 --> 00:43:54,617
God save Your Grace!

472
00:44:01,798 --> 00:44:03,541
God save the King!

473
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:07,624
Lift!

474
00:44:15,643 --> 00:44:16,840
Drop blades!

475
00:44:19,396 --> 00:44:21,637
Sire! Sire! Sire!

476
00:44:53,507 --> 00:44:55,749
Are you coming my way, Rich?

477
00:44:58,053 --> 00:44:59,132
No.

478
00:45:01,139 --> 00:45:03,380
I think you should, you know.

479
00:45:03,849 --> 00:45:05,972
I can't tell you anything.

480
00:45:12,648 --> 00:45:13,810
Well?

481
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:27,738
Thomas?

482
00:45:30,204 --> 00:45:31,995
Stay friends with him.

483
00:45:33,499 --> 00:45:37,246
Whatever may be done by smiling,
you may rely on me to do.

484
00:45:44,508 --> 00:45:46,666
Set your mind at rest.

485
00:45:46,968 --> 00:45:50,218
This is not the stuff
of which martyrs are made.

486
00:45:59,895 --> 00:46:02,896
Good evening, sir, Lady Alice.

487
00:46:04,316 --> 00:46:06,272
Will wants to talk to you, Father.

488
00:46:07,777 --> 00:46:09,686
I told him it wouldn't be convenient.

489
00:46:09,779 --> 00:46:10,774
You were quite right.

490
00:46:11,572 --> 00:46:14,489
You're very free
with my daughter's hand, Roper.

491
00:46:15,033 --> 00:46:15,898
Yes.

492
00:46:16,534 --> 00:46:18,443
It's of that I wish to speak.

493
00:46:18,828 --> 00:46:21,745
Sir, you've had a disagreement
with His Majesty.

494
00:46:22,622 --> 00:46:24,947
-Have l?
-So Meg tells me.

495
00:46:25,041 --> 00:46:26,998
I offer my congratulations.

496
00:46:27,376 --> 00:46:30,293
If it's true,
is it a matter for congratulation?

497
00:46:30,379 --> 00:46:31,410
Yes!

498
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:39,460
Sir, when last I asked you
for your daughter's hand...

499
00:46:39,720 --> 00:46:42,923
...you objected to my unorthodox opinions.

500
00:46:43,473 --> 00:46:44,671
-I did.
-Yes.

501
00:46:44,766 --> 00:46:47,435
Well, since then my views
have somewhat modified.

502
00:46:51,938 --> 00:46:53,729
Well, that's good hearing, Will.

503
00:46:54,691 --> 00:46:58,390
Mind you, I modify nothing concerning
the various corruptions in the Church.

504
00:46:58,485 --> 00:47:01,320
-Quite right.
-But an attack upon the Church herself...

505
00:47:01,404 --> 00:47:03,942
...no. I see behind that an attack on God.

506
00:47:04,032 --> 00:47:05,526
-Roper!
-The Devil's work...

507
00:47:05,616 --> 00:47:07,407
...to be done by the Devil's ministers!

508
00:47:07,493 --> 00:47:09,402
For heaven's sake, remember my office.

509
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:10,953
If you stand on your office--

510
00:47:11,037 --> 00:47:15,248
No, I don't stand on it,
but there are certain things I may not hear.

511
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:16,622
Sir Thomas.

512
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,449
Richard?

513
00:47:21,212 --> 00:47:22,375
I fell.

514
00:47:24,215 --> 00:47:25,460
Lady Alice.

515
00:47:25,800 --> 00:47:27,377
-Lady Margaret.
-Good evening.

516
00:47:27,468 --> 00:47:29,875
Do you know William Roper, the younger?

517
00:47:30,053 --> 00:47:31,927
By reputation, of course.

518
00:47:32,180 --> 00:47:34,468
-Good evening, Master....
-Rich.

519
00:47:41,980 --> 00:47:43,474
You've heard of me?

520
00:47:43,731 --> 00:47:44,846
Yes.

521
00:47:45,191 --> 00:47:48,606
In what connection?
I don't know what you can have heard.

522
00:47:54,490 --> 00:47:56,648
I sense that I'm not welcome here.

523
00:47:56,909 --> 00:47:59,992
Why Richard? Have you done something
to make you not welcome?

524
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:01,453
Cromwell is asking questions.

525
00:48:01,537 --> 00:48:04,953
About you. He's always asking
questions about you and your opinions.

526
00:48:05,457 --> 00:48:06,738
Of whom?

527
00:48:07,793 --> 00:48:10,034
Of him, for one. That's one of his sources.

528
00:48:11,712 --> 00:48:14,084
Of course. That's one of my servants.

529
00:48:15,757 --> 00:48:17,382
All right, Matthew.

530
00:48:22,388 --> 00:48:24,795
Well, you look at me
as though I were an enemy.

531
00:48:27,434 --> 00:48:29,391
Why Richard, you're shaking.

532
00:48:31,145 --> 00:48:32,425
Help me.

533
00:48:33,355 --> 00:48:34,351
How?

534
00:48:34,481 --> 00:48:35,761
Employ me.

535
00:48:36,483 --> 00:48:37,562
No.

536
00:48:38,109 --> 00:48:39,900
-Employ me!
-No.

537
00:48:55,499 --> 00:48:57,325
I would be faithful.

538
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:05,249
You couldn't answer for yourself
even so far as tonight.

539
00:49:17,392 --> 00:49:18,590
Arrest him!

540
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:20,220
-For what?
-He's dangerous!

541
00:49:20,311 --> 00:49:22,102
-Libel. He's a spy!
-That man's bad!

542
00:49:22,187 --> 00:49:24,393
-There's no law against that.
-God's law!

543
00:49:24,481 --> 00:49:27,054
-Then God can arrest him.
-While you talk, he's gone!

544
00:49:27,150 --> 00:49:30,186
Go he should, if he were the Devil,
until he broke the law.

545
00:49:30,277 --> 00:49:33,942
-Now you give the Devil benefit of law!
-Yes, what would you do?

546
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,568
Cut a road through the law
to get after the Devil?

547
00:49:36,658 --> 00:49:39,611
Yes. I'd cut down every law in England
to do that.

548
00:49:40,452 --> 00:49:43,536
And when the last law was down,
and the Devil turned on you...

549
00:49:43,622 --> 00:49:46,657
...where would you hide, Roper,
the laws all being flat?

550
00:49:46,749 --> 00:49:49,454
This country is planted with laws
from coast to coast...

551
00:49:49,543 --> 00:49:52,164
...Man's laws, not God's,
and if you cut them down...

552
00:49:52,254 --> 00:49:53,997
...and you're just the man to do it...

553
00:49:54,089 --> 00:49:58,584
...do you really think you could stand
upright in the wind that would blow then?

554
00:49:59,551 --> 00:50:00,381
Yes.

555
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:04,762
I give the Devil benefit of law
for my own safety's sake.

556
00:50:42,670 --> 00:50:44,413
-Master Rich?
-Yes.

557
00:50:44,547 --> 00:50:46,089
In there, sir.

558
00:50:52,137 --> 00:50:54,176
Rich? Come in.

559
00:50:58,225 --> 00:51:00,347
Taken you long enough to get here.

560
00:51:00,435 --> 00:51:02,143
Have I kept you waiting?

561
00:51:03,354 --> 00:51:04,599
Months.

562
00:51:06,982 --> 00:51:09,188
-Here.
-Thank you.

563
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,152
Do you know the news?

564
00:51:12,487 --> 00:51:15,606
-What news?
-Sir Thomas Paget is retiring.

565
00:51:17,157 --> 00:51:19,233
And I succeed him.

566
00:51:20,452 --> 00:51:22,195
Secretary to the Council?

567
00:51:22,286 --> 00:51:23,401
You?

568
00:51:23,954 --> 00:51:25,662
'Tis surprising, isn't it?

569
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,827
I mean, one sees that's logical.

570
00:51:31,794 --> 00:51:34,664
Sit down, Rich.
No ceremony, no courtship...

571
00:51:34,797 --> 00:51:36,872
...as His Majesty would say.

572
00:51:40,343 --> 00:51:42,134
You see how I trust you.

573
00:51:43,095 --> 00:51:45,846
I'd never repeat or report a thing like that.

574
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:49,927
What kind of thing
would you repeat or report?

575
00:51:52,019 --> 00:51:53,810
Nothing said in friendship.

576
00:51:54,229 --> 00:51:55,558
Do you believe that?

577
00:51:55,647 --> 00:51:57,640
-Why, yes.
-No, seriously.

578
00:51:57,732 --> 00:51:59,107
Well, yes.

579
00:51:59,442 --> 00:52:03,391
Rich, seriously.

580
00:52:08,616 --> 00:52:11,949
That would depend what I was offered.

581
00:52:13,829 --> 00:52:15,453
Don't say it just to please me.

582
00:52:15,539 --> 00:52:18,243
It's true. It would depend
what I was offered.

583
00:52:20,334 --> 00:52:23,288
Well, there is another post vacant.

584
00:52:23,754 --> 00:52:25,960
Collector of Revenues for York.

585
00:52:26,589 --> 00:52:28,214
Is it in your gift?

586
00:52:28,299 --> 00:52:29,674
Effectively.

587
00:52:30,718 --> 00:52:32,509
What must I do for it?

588
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:38,215
I know a man
who wants to change his woman.

589
00:52:39,850 --> 00:52:42,767
Normally a matter of small importance,
but in this case...

590
00:52:42,853 --> 00:52:46,019
...it's our liege, Lord Henry,
the eighth of that name.

591
00:52:46,773 --> 00:52:51,149
Which is a quaint way of saying that
if he wants to change his woman, he will.

592
00:52:51,235 --> 00:52:53,393
And our job as administrators...

593
00:52:53,987 --> 00:52:58,316
...is to minimise the inconvenience
which this is going to cause.

594
00:52:58,449 --> 00:53:02,742
That's our only job, Rich,
to minimise the inconvenience of things.

595
00:53:03,203 --> 00:53:06,203
A harmless occupation
you would say, but no.

596
00:53:06,456 --> 00:53:09,456
We administrators are not liked, Rich.

597
00:53:09,917 --> 00:53:11,708
We are not popular.

598
00:53:11,793 --> 00:53:16,004
I say "we" on the assumption you'll accept
the post at York I've offered you.

599
00:53:20,968 --> 00:53:22,082
Yes.

600
00:53:29,933 --> 00:53:33,302
It's a bad sign when people are depressed
by their own good fortune.

601
00:53:33,395 --> 00:53:35,434
-I'm not depressed.
-You look depressed.

602
00:53:35,521 --> 00:53:37,929
I was lamenting. I've lost my innocence.

603
00:53:38,023 --> 00:53:40,894
Some time ago.
Have you only just noticed?

604
00:53:42,402 --> 00:53:46,565
Your friend, our present Lord Chancellor,
now there's an innocent man.

605
00:53:48,699 --> 00:53:50,572
The odd thing is, he is.

606
00:53:50,826 --> 00:53:53,826
Yes, I say he is. Unhappily...

607
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:56,283
...his innocence is tangled up
in this problem...

608
00:53:56,372 --> 00:53:59,123
...that you can't change your woman
without a divorce...

609
00:53:59,208 --> 00:54:02,457
...and you can't get a divorce
unless the Pope says so.

610
00:54:02,585 --> 00:54:07,128
And from this meaningless circumstance,
I foresee a certain measure of....

611
00:54:07,464 --> 00:54:09,753
-lnconvenience?
-Just so.

612
00:54:10,842 --> 00:54:13,593
This goblet he gave you,
how much was it worth?

613
00:54:15,513 --> 00:54:19,723
Come along, he gave you a silver goblet.
How much did you get for it?

614
00:54:20,058 --> 00:54:21,256
Fifty shillings.

615
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:24,351
It was a gift, wasn't it,
from a litigant, a woman?

616
00:54:24,937 --> 00:54:26,929
-Yes.
-Which court? Chancery?

617
00:54:28,690 --> 00:54:30,766
Don't get drunk!

618
00:54:31,276 --> 00:54:33,849
Which court was the litigant's case?

619
00:54:35,779 --> 00:54:37,523
Court of Requests.

620
00:54:39,616 --> 00:54:42,367
There. That wasn't too painful, was it?

621
00:54:44,995 --> 00:54:46,406
-No.
-No.

622
00:54:46,538 --> 00:54:49,159
And you'll find it easier, next time.

623
00:55:24,570 --> 00:55:27,404
My Lord Archbishop, my lords...

624
00:55:27,781 --> 00:55:30,152
...Reverend Doctors of the Church.

625
00:55:30,366 --> 00:55:33,283
The answer of our liege, Lord Henry...

626
00:55:33,369 --> 00:55:35,824
...to his trusty well-beloved subjects...

627
00:55:35,912 --> 00:55:38,664
...pontiffs in the Canterbury Convocation.

628
00:55:40,374 --> 00:55:41,655
"His Majesty...

629
00:55:41,792 --> 00:55:45,741
"...acknowledges your humble admission
of many grievous errors...

630
00:55:46,921 --> 00:55:48,380
"...for which he accepts...

631
00:55:48,464 --> 00:55:53,126
"...the manumission of 100,000 in token.

632
00:55:55,637 --> 00:55:59,468
"Mindful for the well-being of the realm
and the quietness of his subjects...

633
00:55:59,557 --> 00:56:03,969
"...His Majesty requires that you do now
straightly renounce your pretended...

634
00:56:04,061 --> 00:56:06,468
"...allegiance to the See of Rome.

635
00:56:07,021 --> 00:56:10,188
"And admit the statute
passed through parliament...

636
00:56:10,524 --> 00:56:13,062
"...acknowledging the King's good title...

637
00:56:13,652 --> 00:56:16,439
"...Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

638
00:56:22,076 --> 00:56:25,029
Well, my lords, what's your answer?

639
00:56:26,996 --> 00:56:29,368
Yea or nay?

640
00:56:31,667 --> 00:56:34,204
His Majesty accepts your resignation
very sadly.

641
00:56:34,586 --> 00:56:36,958
He's mindful of your goodness
and past loyalty.

642
00:56:37,046 --> 00:56:41,542
And in any matter concerning your honour
and welfare he'll continue your good lord.

643
00:56:42,926 --> 00:56:45,167
You will convey my humble gratitude.

644
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:53,840
-Help me with this.
-Not l.

645
00:56:57,396 --> 00:56:59,270
-Alice?
-No.

646
00:57:00,232 --> 00:57:04,977
Sun and moon, Master More, you're taken
for a wise man. Is this wisdom?

647
00:57:05,278 --> 00:57:06,985
To betray your ability...

648
00:57:07,071 --> 00:57:10,735
...abandon your station
and forget your duty to your kith and kin?

649
00:57:11,450 --> 00:57:13,109
Shall l, sir?

650
00:57:14,786 --> 00:57:17,407
No, thank you, son Roper.

651
00:57:19,248 --> 00:57:20,410
Margaret...

652
00:57:21,708 --> 00:57:23,083
...will you?

653
00:57:24,419 --> 00:57:25,663
Yes.

654
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:32,708
If you want.

655
00:57:37,846 --> 00:57:39,720
There's my clever girl.

656
00:57:43,101 --> 00:57:47,513
Well done, sir! In my opinion,
that thing's a degradation.

657
00:57:47,646 --> 00:57:50,219
I'll tell you my opinion
of the King's title, too--

658
00:57:50,315 --> 00:57:54,182
Don't! Will, silence!
Remember, you have a wife now...

659
00:57:55,069 --> 00:57:56,812
...and may have children.

660
00:58:08,663 --> 00:58:10,739
All right, Thomas, make me understand...

661
00:58:10,832 --> 00:58:13,619
...because I tell you,
to me this looks like cowardice!

662
00:58:13,709 --> 00:58:14,658
All right, I will.

663
00:58:14,960 --> 00:58:18,495
This isn't reformation,
this is war against the Church.

664
00:58:18,713 --> 00:58:22,378
Our King has declared war on the Pope
because the Pope will not declare...

665
00:58:22,467 --> 00:58:25,337
-...that our Queen is not his wife.
-And is she?

666
00:58:28,430 --> 00:58:29,758
Is she?

667
00:58:32,266 --> 00:58:35,183
Have I your word that what we say here
is between us two?

668
00:58:35,269 --> 00:58:36,467
Very well.

669
00:58:36,603 --> 00:58:40,137
And if the King should command you
to repeat what I may say?

670
00:58:40,273 --> 00:58:42,230
I should keep my word to you.

671
00:58:42,358 --> 00:58:46,189
Then what has become of your oath
of obedience to the King?

672
00:58:48,905 --> 00:58:50,732
You lay traps for me!

673
00:58:50,823 --> 00:58:53,444
No, I show you the times.

674
00:58:56,745 --> 00:59:00,612
We are at war with the Pope.
For the Pope's a prince, isn't he?

675
00:59:00,706 --> 00:59:04,750
He is. He's also the descendant
of St. Peter, our only link with Christ.

676
00:59:04,835 --> 00:59:08,702
So you believe.
And will you forfeit all you have...

677
00:59:08,796 --> 00:59:11,750
...which includes the respect
of your country, for a belief?

678
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:15,126
Because what matters
is that I believe it, or rather, no...

679
00:59:15,719 --> 00:59:18,885
...not that I believe it, but that I believe it.

680
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:23,049
-I trust I make myself obscure?
-Perfectly.

681
00:59:25,810 --> 00:59:29,642
Why do you insult me
with this lawyer's chatter?

682
00:59:30,356 --> 00:59:32,265
Because I'm afraid.

683
00:59:32,441 --> 00:59:34,065
Man, you're ill.

684
00:59:36,861 --> 00:59:39,482
This isn't Spain, you know.
This is England.

685
00:59:58,921 --> 01:00:02,965
My friends, you all know
why I've called you here.

686
01:00:03,717 --> 01:00:07,132
I have today resigned my office.

687
01:00:09,597 --> 01:00:12,597
I am no longer a great man.

688
01:00:13,808 --> 01:00:17,093
Sir, we want you to know
that we're all on your side.

689
01:00:17,937 --> 01:00:20,392
My side? What side is that?

690
01:00:20,773 --> 01:00:22,681
Well, sir, we all know what you think.

691
01:00:22,774 --> 01:00:25,265
None of you knows what I think.
And if you guess...

692
01:00:25,360 --> 01:00:28,395
...and babble it about,
you do me no good service.

693
01:00:30,197 --> 01:00:34,064
Since I am no more a great man,
I no longer need a great household.

694
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:38,950
Nor can I afford one. You will have to go.

695
01:00:39,329 --> 01:00:42,413
However, I still number some great men
among my friends...

696
01:00:42,499 --> 01:00:44,787
...and they still need great households.

697
01:00:44,876 --> 01:00:48,291
No one will be turned away
until we've found another place for him.

698
01:00:48,379 --> 01:00:51,296
-We can't find places for them all.
-Yes, we can.

699
01:00:53,508 --> 01:00:55,002
Thank you.

700
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:57,796
That is all.

701
01:01:08,520 --> 01:01:10,180
What about you, Matthew?

702
01:01:13,858 --> 01:01:15,400
Will you stay?

703
01:01:15,526 --> 01:01:17,483
Well, sir, that's according.

704
01:01:17,569 --> 01:01:20,356
There will be more work and less money.

705
01:01:21,698 --> 01:01:25,742
Well then, I don't see how I can then, sir.
After all, I've got my own--

706
01:01:25,826 --> 01:01:29,775
Quite right, Matthew. Why should you?
I shall miss you, Matthew.

707
01:01:30,914 --> 01:01:33,700
Oh, no, sir, you see through me, sir.
I know that.

708
01:01:38,378 --> 01:01:40,086
I shall miss you.

709
01:01:51,681 --> 01:01:53,969
Damn me! Isn't that them all over!

710
01:01:54,433 --> 01:01:56,805
Miss me? What's in me for him to miss?

711
01:01:56,894 --> 01:02:01,222
"Matthew, will you take a cut in wages?"
No, Sir Thomas, I will not.

712
01:02:01,314 --> 01:02:06,224
And that's it. And that's all of it! All right,
so he's down on his luck, I'm sorry.

713
01:02:07,027 --> 01:02:09,268
I don't mind saying
that I'm sorry, bad luck.

714
01:02:09,571 --> 01:02:11,729
If I had good luck to spare
he could have some!

715
01:02:11,822 --> 01:02:13,815
I wish we could have good luck
all the time.

716
01:02:13,908 --> 01:02:18,533
I wish rainwater was beer!
I wish we had wings! But we don't.

717
01:02:29,671 --> 01:02:32,042
Well, there's an end of you.

718
01:02:32,923 --> 01:02:34,962
What'll you do now? Sit by the fire...

719
01:02:35,050 --> 01:02:37,208
...and make goslings in the ash?

720
01:02:37,302 --> 01:02:39,341
Not at all, Alice.

721
01:02:40,221 --> 01:02:42,628
I expect I'll write a bit...

722
01:02:43,807 --> 01:02:45,182
...I'll write...

723
01:02:46,059 --> 01:02:48,217
...I'll read, I'll think.

724
01:02:49,854 --> 01:02:51,680
I think I'll learn to fish.

725
01:02:53,440 --> 01:02:57,389
I'll play with my grandchildren
when son Roper's done his duty.

726
01:02:59,153 --> 01:03:02,569
-Alice, shall I teach you to read?
-No, by God!

727
01:03:06,034 --> 01:03:08,951
Poor, silly man,
you think they'll leave you here to think?

728
01:03:09,036 --> 01:03:11,492
If we govern our tongues, they will!

729
01:03:15,166 --> 01:03:19,709
I have a word to say on that. I've made
no statement. I've resigned, that's all.

730
01:03:21,046 --> 01:03:24,995
The King is made, by act of parliament,
Supreme Head of the Church in England.

731
01:03:25,091 --> 01:03:29,384
This English Church will divorce him from
the Queen, then marry him to Lady Anne.

732
01:03:29,470 --> 01:03:33,337
But on any of these matters,
have you heard me make a statement?

733
01:03:33,473 --> 01:03:34,504
No.

734
01:03:34,808 --> 01:03:38,591
If I'm to lose my rank and fall to
housekeeping, I want to know the reason.

735
01:03:38,686 --> 01:03:40,725
-So make a statement now.
-No.

736
01:03:40,813 --> 01:03:43,813
Alice, it's a point of law.
Accept it from me...

737
01:03:43,898 --> 01:03:46,815
...that in silence is my safety,
under the law.

738
01:03:46,901 --> 01:03:50,565
And my silence must be absolute,
it must extend to you.

739
01:03:50,654 --> 01:03:52,777
In short, you don't trust me.

740
01:03:56,492 --> 01:04:00,441
I'm the Lord Chief Justice,
I'm Cromwell, I'm the keeper of the Tower.

741
01:04:00,787 --> 01:04:02,163
I take your hand...

742
01:04:02,247 --> 01:04:06,114
...I clamp it on the Bible,
on the blessed Cross and I say:

743
01:04:06,209 --> 01:04:09,577
"Woman, has your husband
made a statement on these matters?

744
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:13,621
"On peril of your soul remember,
what is your answer?"

745
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:16,795
No.

746
01:04:18,052 --> 01:04:20,838
And so it must remain.

747
01:04:29,811 --> 01:04:32,302
Have you opened your mind to Meg?

748
01:04:32,772 --> 01:04:35,559
Would I tell Meg what I won't tell you?

749
01:04:36,275 --> 01:04:39,643
Meg has your heart.
I know that well enough.

750
01:04:51,371 --> 01:04:53,529
This is a dangerous matter then...

751
01:04:54,498 --> 01:04:56,289
...if you've not told Meg.

752
01:04:56,959 --> 01:04:59,912
I don't think so. No.

753
01:05:01,254 --> 01:05:03,377
When they find I'm silent...

754
01:05:04,131 --> 01:05:07,298
...they'll want nothing better
than to leave me silent.

755
01:05:08,552 --> 01:05:10,094
You'll see.

756
01:05:32,238 --> 01:05:35,606
But he's silent, Master Secretary,
why not leave him silent?

757
01:05:35,782 --> 01:05:38,818
Your Grace, not being a man of letters...

758
01:05:39,452 --> 01:05:42,287
...you perhaps don't realise
the extent of his reputation.

759
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:45,325
This silence of his
is bellowing up and down Europe!

760
01:05:45,415 --> 01:05:47,621
In Europe he is claimed
as the King's enemy.

761
01:05:47,709 --> 01:05:50,164
Rubbish! Crank he may be,
traitor he is not.

762
01:05:50,253 --> 01:05:52,660
Exactly. And with a little pressure....

763
01:05:53,672 --> 01:05:55,878
With a little pressure
he can be got to say so.

764
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:58,717
That's all we need.
A brief declaration of his loyalty...

765
01:05:58,801 --> 01:06:02,715
-...to the present administration.
-I still say, let sleeping dogs lie.

766
01:06:03,597 --> 01:06:05,885
The King does not agree with you.

767
01:06:10,937 --> 01:06:15,064
What kind of pressure do you think
you can bring to bear?

768
01:06:15,732 --> 01:06:19,681
I have evidence that Sir Thomas,
while he was a judge, accepted bribes.

769
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:21,188
What?

770
01:06:21,487 --> 01:06:25,401
Goddammit! He was the only judge
since Cato who didn't accept bribes!

771
01:06:25,490 --> 01:06:28,775
When was there a chancellor
whose possessions, after three years...

772
01:06:28,868 --> 01:06:31,703
...totalled 100 and a gold chain?

773
01:06:35,707 --> 01:06:38,032
It is, as you imply, common practice...

774
01:06:38,126 --> 01:06:41,161
...but a practice may be common
and remain an offence.

775
01:06:41,253 --> 01:06:43,826
This offence could send a man
to the Tower.

776
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:50,290
Come here.

777
01:06:51,303 --> 01:06:54,636
This woman's name is Averil Machin.
She comes from Leicester.

778
01:06:54,723 --> 01:06:56,845
-She entered a case--
-A property case it was.

779
01:06:56,933 --> 01:06:58,391
Shut your mouth.

780
01:06:59,310 --> 01:07:02,014
A property case in the Court of Requests
in April, 1528.

781
01:07:02,104 --> 01:07:03,646
And got a wicked false judgement!

782
01:07:03,730 --> 01:07:06,565
And got an impeccably correct judgement
from Sir Thomas.

783
01:07:06,649 --> 01:07:08,725
-No, sir, it was not!
-Tell the gentleman...

784
01:07:08,818 --> 01:07:11,522
...about the gift you gave the judge.

785
01:07:12,654 --> 01:07:14,362
I gave him a cup, sir.

786
01:07:14,489 --> 01:07:17,940
A silver ltalian cup I bought in Leicester,
for 100 shillings.

787
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:20,026
Did Sir Thomas accept this cup?

788
01:07:20,285 --> 01:07:21,483
Yes, sir, he did.

789
01:07:21,578 --> 01:07:25,029
He did accept it. We can corroborate that.
You can go.

790
01:07:25,373 --> 01:07:27,282
-To my way of thinking--
-Go!

791
01:07:36,215 --> 01:07:38,884
-ls that your witness?
-No.

792
01:07:39,676 --> 01:07:44,421
By an odd coincidence that cup later
came into the hands of Master Rich here.

793
01:07:46,223 --> 01:07:47,338
How?

794
01:07:50,268 --> 01:07:53,352
-He gave it to me, Your Grace.
-Gave it to you? Why?

795
01:07:53,771 --> 01:07:55,016
A gift.

796
01:07:56,023 --> 01:07:59,142
Yes, you were a friend, weren't you?

797
01:07:59,776 --> 01:08:02,018
When did Thomas give you this thing?

798
01:08:02,862 --> 01:08:04,736
I can't exactly remember.

799
01:08:07,574 --> 01:08:09,982
Do you "remember" what you did with it?

800
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:12,201
-I sold it.
-Where?

801
01:08:12,870 --> 01:08:15,076
-A shop.
-Has the shop still got it?

802
01:08:16,165 --> 01:08:18,323
No. They've lost all track of it.

803
01:08:18,584 --> 01:08:20,042
How convenient.

804
01:08:22,170 --> 01:08:24,292
You doubt Master Rich's word,
Your Grace?

805
01:08:24,380 --> 01:08:26,705
It had occurred to me.

806
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:31,835
This is the bill of sale.

807
01:08:42,645 --> 01:08:47,436
That cow put her case into court in April,
you said. This is dated May.

808
01:08:48,567 --> 01:08:51,520
In other words, the moment Thomas knew
the cup was a bribe...

809
01:08:51,611 --> 01:08:55,026
...he dropped it into the nearest gutter.

810
01:08:57,908 --> 01:09:00,908
The facts will bear that interpretation,
I suppose.

811
01:09:02,161 --> 01:09:04,912
This is a horse that won't run,
Master Secretary.

812
01:09:04,997 --> 01:09:07,783
Just a trial gallop.
We'll find something better.

813
01:09:07,874 --> 01:09:10,447
-I want no part of it.
-You have no choice.

814
01:09:12,336 --> 01:09:14,079
What's that you say?

815
01:09:15,547 --> 01:09:19,959
The King particularly wishes you
to be active in this matter of Sir Thomas.

816
01:09:20,426 --> 01:09:21,968
He's not told me that.

817
01:09:22,053 --> 01:09:23,961
Indeed? He told me.

818
01:09:28,099 --> 01:09:29,723
Look here, Cromwell...

819
01:09:30,017 --> 01:09:32,176
...what's the purpose of all this?

820
01:09:32,311 --> 01:09:33,853
There you have me.

821
01:09:35,230 --> 01:09:37,472
It's a matter of conscience, I think.

822
01:09:37,690 --> 01:09:41,189
The King wants Sir Thomas
to bless his marriage.

823
01:09:41,652 --> 01:09:46,147
If Sir Thomas appeared at the wedding
now, it might save us all a lot of trouble.

824
01:09:48,700 --> 01:09:51,107
He won't attend the wedding.

825
01:09:51,243 --> 01:09:53,734
If I were you, I'd try and persuade him.

826
01:09:54,371 --> 01:09:57,537
I really would try, if I were you.

827
01:10:00,042 --> 01:10:03,043
Cromwell, are you threatening me?

828
01:10:03,170 --> 01:10:06,503
My dear Norfolk, this isn't Spain.

829
01:10:07,382 --> 01:10:09,041
This is England!

830
01:12:25,412 --> 01:12:27,903
Thomas? Thomas!

831
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:34,958
Lady Margaret?

832
01:13:35,053 --> 01:13:35,918
Yes.

833
01:13:38,222 --> 01:13:41,721
We've been cutting greens.
We use them for fuel.

834
01:13:43,977 --> 01:13:48,306
I have a letter for your father,
Lady Margaret. From Hampton Court.

835
01:13:51,733 --> 01:13:55,861
He's to answer certain charges
before Secretary Cromwell.

836
01:13:59,031 --> 01:14:00,905
Good of you to come, Sir Thomas.

837
01:14:06,913 --> 01:14:09,450
Master Rich will make a record
of our conversation.

838
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:11,579
Good of you to tell me, Master Secretary.

839
01:14:11,667 --> 01:14:13,161
I think you know one another.

840
01:14:13,251 --> 01:14:15,576
Indeed yes, we're old friends.

841
01:14:16,546 --> 01:14:18,870
That's a nice gown you have, Richard.

842
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:26,293
Sir Thomas, believe me.

843
01:14:26,512 --> 01:14:30,592
No, that's asking too much.
But let me tell you all the same.

844
01:14:30,891 --> 01:14:34,674
You have no more sincere admirer
than myself.

845
01:14:35,812 --> 01:14:38,183
No, not yet, Rich, not yet.

846
01:14:42,192 --> 01:14:44,018
If I might hear the charges.

847
01:14:44,110 --> 01:14:47,064
-The charges?
-I understand there are certain charges.

848
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:50,772
Some ambiguities of behaviour
I should like to clarify, hardly charges.

849
01:14:50,866 --> 01:14:54,530
Make a note of that, will you, Master Rich?
There are no charges.

850
01:14:55,536 --> 01:14:57,778
Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas.

851
01:15:02,792 --> 01:15:05,828
The King is not pleased with you.

852
01:15:06,629 --> 01:15:08,123
I am grieved.

853
01:15:08,922 --> 01:15:12,421
And yet, do you know that even now,
if you could bring yourself...

854
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:16,126
...to agree with the Church,
universities, the Lords and the Commons...

855
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:20,003
...there is no honour which His Majesty
would be likely to deny you?

856
01:15:20,557 --> 01:15:23,842
I am well acquainted with
His Grace's generosity.

857
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:28,052
Very well.

858
01:15:30,523 --> 01:15:34,770
You have heard of the so-called
"Holy Maid of Kent"...

859
01:15:35,194 --> 01:15:37,684
...who was executed for prophesying
against the King?

860
01:15:37,779 --> 01:15:39,937
-Yes, I met her.
-Yes, you met her.

861
01:15:40,115 --> 01:15:43,732
Yet you did not warn His Majesty
of her treason. How was that?

862
01:15:43,826 --> 01:15:47,194
She spoke no treason.
Our talk was not political.

863
01:15:47,579 --> 01:15:50,579
But the woman was notorious.
Do you expect me to believe that?

864
01:15:50,665 --> 01:15:53,868
-Happily, there were witnesses.
-You wrote a letter to her.

865
01:15:53,959 --> 01:15:58,870
Yes. I wrote, advising her to abstain
from meddling in the affairs of state.

866
01:15:58,963 --> 01:16:02,877
I have a copy of the letter. Also witnessed.

867
01:16:05,052 --> 01:16:10,128
-You have been cautious.
-I like to keep my affairs regular.

868
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:21,142
In the June of 1521,
the King published a book.

869
01:16:22,149 --> 01:16:23,643
A theological work.

870
01:16:25,152 --> 01:16:27,856
It was called,
A Defence of the Seven Sacraments.

871
01:16:27,946 --> 01:16:32,903
For which he was named "Defender
of the Faith" by His Holiness, the Pope.

872
01:16:32,992 --> 01:16:36,360
By the Bishop of Rome,
or do you insist on "pope"?

873
01:16:36,453 --> 01:16:40,616
No. "Bishop of Rome" if you like.
It doesn't alter his authority.

874
01:16:41,749 --> 01:16:47,087
Thank you. You come to the point
very readily. What is that authority?

875
01:16:47,170 --> 01:16:49,246
For example, in the Church of England...

876
01:16:49,338 --> 01:16:52,173
...what exactly is
the Bishop of Rome's authority?

877
01:16:53,091 --> 01:16:57,420
You will find it very ably set out
and defended, Master Secretary...

878
01:16:57,679 --> 01:16:59,470
...in the King's book.

879
01:17:00,056 --> 01:17:03,389
In the book published under
the King's name, would be more accurate.

880
01:17:03,475 --> 01:17:05,966
-You wrote this book.
-I wrote no part of it.

881
01:17:06,061 --> 01:17:07,934
I don't mean you actually held the pen.

882
01:17:08,020 --> 01:17:10,855
I answered to my best ability,
some points of common law...

883
01:17:10,940 --> 01:17:13,264
...which the King put to me,
as I was bound to do.

884
01:17:13,358 --> 01:17:14,936
Do you deny you instigated it?

885
01:17:15,026 --> 01:17:18,608
It was from first to last
the King's own project.

886
01:17:18,696 --> 01:17:19,810
The King says not.

887
01:17:23,283 --> 01:17:25,608
The King knows the truth of it.

888
01:17:26,494 --> 01:17:28,782
And whatever he may have said to you...

889
01:17:28,871 --> 01:17:32,074
...he will not give evidence
to support this accusation.

890
01:17:33,500 --> 01:17:34,780
Why not?

891
01:17:34,876 --> 01:17:39,169
Because evidence is given on oath,
and he will not perjure himself.

892
01:17:39,755 --> 01:17:43,503
If you don't know that,
then you don't yet know him.

893
01:17:49,179 --> 01:17:50,555
Sir Thomas More.

894
01:17:50,722 --> 01:17:51,920
Have you anything to say...

895
01:17:52,015 --> 01:17:54,387
...regarding the King's marriage
with Queen Anne?

896
01:17:55,309 --> 01:17:57,634
I understood
I was not to be asked that again.

897
01:17:57,728 --> 01:17:59,851
Then you understood wrongly.
These charges--

898
01:17:59,938 --> 01:18:04,398
They are terrors for children,
Master Secretary, not for me!

899
01:18:10,113 --> 01:18:12,865
Then know that the King
commands me to charge you...

900
01:18:12,949 --> 01:18:15,522
...in his name, with great ingratitude!

901
01:18:16,327 --> 01:18:20,406
And to tell you that there never was,
nor could be, so villainous a servant...

902
01:18:20,497 --> 01:18:23,367
...nor so traitorous a subject, as yourself!

903
01:18:25,209 --> 01:18:26,240
So...

904
01:18:28,962 --> 01:18:31,251
...I am brought here at last.

905
01:18:32,215 --> 01:18:33,246
Brought?

906
01:18:34,550 --> 01:18:37,219
You've brought yourself
to where you stand now.

907
01:18:39,471 --> 01:18:40,633
You may go.

908
01:18:46,185 --> 01:18:47,560
For the present.

909
01:18:53,983 --> 01:18:55,607
What will you do now?

910
01:18:57,819 --> 01:18:59,693
Whatever's necessary.

911
01:19:08,662 --> 01:19:09,693
Boat!

912
01:19:26,593 --> 01:19:29,594
Oh, come, come, it's not as bad as all that!

913
01:19:35,058 --> 01:19:36,303
Howard!

914
01:19:42,356 --> 01:19:43,934
I can't get home.

915
01:19:44,691 --> 01:19:46,518
They won't bring me a boat.

916
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:48,561
Do you blame them?

917
01:19:48,736 --> 01:19:50,361
Is it as bad as that?

918
01:19:50,821 --> 01:19:53,146
It's every bit as bad as that!

919
01:19:54,241 --> 01:19:56,778
Then it's good of you to be seen with me.

920
01:19:56,868 --> 01:19:58,446
I followed you.

921
01:19:59,579 --> 01:20:01,322
Were you followed?

922
01:20:11,881 --> 01:20:14,087
-You're dangerous to know!
-Then don't know me.

923
01:20:14,174 --> 01:20:16,131
-I do know you.
-I mean as a friend.

924
01:20:16,217 --> 01:20:20,261
-I am your friend. I wish I wasn't, but I am.
-What's to be done then?

925
01:20:20,388 --> 01:20:22,463
-Give in.
-I can't give in, Howard.

926
01:20:22,556 --> 01:20:24,844
Our friendship's more mutable than that.

927
01:20:24,933 --> 01:20:27,684
The one fixed point in the world
of turning friendship...

928
01:20:27,769 --> 01:20:31,517
-...is that Sir More won't give in.
-To me it has to be, for that's myself.

929
01:20:31,605 --> 01:20:34,226
Affection goes as deep in me
as you, I think.

930
01:20:34,691 --> 01:20:39,151
But only God is love right through,
Howard, and that's my self.

931
01:20:40,738 --> 01:20:42,113
And who are you?

932
01:20:43,865 --> 01:20:45,941
A lawyer! And a lawyer's son!

933
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:50,078
We're supposed to be the proud ones,
the arrogant ones, we've all given in.

934
01:20:50,162 --> 01:20:51,822
Why must you stand out?

935
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:55,282
Goddammit man! It's disproportionate!

936
01:20:58,502 --> 01:21:00,080
You'll break my heart.

937
01:21:01,296 --> 01:21:05,163
No one is safe, Howard,
and you have a son.

938
01:21:08,511 --> 01:21:10,799
We'll end our friendship now.

939
01:21:11,221 --> 01:21:13,344
-For friendship's sake?
-Yes.

940
01:21:14,140 --> 01:21:15,054
Daft!

941
01:21:22,814 --> 01:21:24,723
Norfolk, you're a fool!

942
01:21:26,150 --> 01:21:28,605
You can't place a quarrel,
you haven't the style.

943
01:21:28,694 --> 01:21:32,312
Hear me out. You and your class
have given in, as you rightly call it...

944
01:21:32,405 --> 01:21:35,406
...'cause this country's religion
means nothing to you at all.

945
01:21:35,491 --> 01:21:37,733
Well, that's a foolish saying for a start!

946
01:21:38,702 --> 01:21:40,244
The nobility of England--

947
01:21:40,329 --> 01:21:44,456
The nobility of England would have
snored through the Sermon on the Mount!

948
01:21:44,540 --> 01:21:48,324
But you'll labour like scholars
over a bulldog's pedigree.

949
01:21:48,836 --> 01:21:50,709
An artificial quarrel is not a quarrel.

950
01:21:50,796 --> 01:21:54,495
We've had a quarrel since the day we met.
Our friendship was mere sloth.

951
01:21:54,799 --> 01:21:57,633
You can be cruel when you want,
but I've always known that.

952
01:21:57,718 --> 01:22:00,921
What do you value in your bulldogs?
Gripping, is it not?

953
01:22:02,931 --> 01:22:04,175
-Yes.
-It's their nature?

954
01:22:04,265 --> 01:22:06,056
-Yes.
-It's why you breed them?

955
01:22:06,142 --> 01:22:07,339
It's so with men.

956
01:22:07,768 --> 01:22:09,760
I will not give in, because I oppose it.

957
01:22:09,853 --> 01:22:15,439
Not my pride, not my spleen,
nor any other of my appetites, but I do, l.

958
01:22:16,317 --> 01:22:20,396
Is there, in the midst of all this muscle,
no sinew that serves no appetite...

959
01:22:20,487 --> 01:22:22,812
...of Norfolk's, but is just Norfolk?
There is!

960
01:22:22,905 --> 01:22:24,862
-Give that some exercise, my lord!
-Thomas!

961
01:22:24,949 --> 01:22:27,985
As you stand you'll go before your Maker
ill conditioned!

962
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:28,776
Now steady.

963
01:22:28,869 --> 01:22:33,779
And he'll think that, somewhere back along
your pedigree, a bitch got over the wall!

964
01:22:48,176 --> 01:22:52,220
Cast in this very house
on April 3, last year...

965
01:22:52,597 --> 01:22:56,973
...it is a matter very fit
for the Commons, gathered here...

966
01:22:57,059 --> 01:22:59,631
...in parliament, to take in hand.

967
01:22:59,894 --> 01:23:04,057
Or, in consequence of the decay of guilds...

968
01:23:04,356 --> 01:23:08,484
...the woolen cloth, now coming out
of Yorkshire, Lincoln...

969
01:23:08,568 --> 01:23:12,067
...and the like, is not to blame and this....

970
01:23:14,198 --> 01:23:17,364
I will defer the rest of my matter to later.

971
01:23:24,873 --> 01:23:29,285
That the loyal Commons, here assembled,
will speedily enact this bill, I doubt not.

972
01:23:29,544 --> 01:23:33,956
For as much as it concerns the King's
new title and his marriage to Queen Anne.

973
01:23:34,256 --> 01:23:38,004
Both matters pleasing to a loyal subject.

974
01:23:39,635 --> 01:23:41,378
Mark, my Masters...

975
01:23:41,720 --> 01:23:46,216
...there is among us
a brood of discreet traitors...

976
01:23:46,599 --> 01:23:48,924
...to which deceit
the King can brook no longer.

977
01:23:49,018 --> 01:23:55,055
And we, his loyal huntsmen, must now
drive these subtle foxes from their covert.

978
01:24:23,922 --> 01:24:24,704
Father?

979
01:24:24,798 --> 01:24:25,877
Margaret!

980
01:24:27,466 --> 01:24:29,174
I couldn't get a boat.

981
01:24:29,718 --> 01:24:31,343
What is it, Meg?

982
01:24:31,428 --> 01:24:34,097
Father, there's a new act
going through parliament.

983
01:24:36,307 --> 01:24:38,798
And by this act,
they're going to administer an oath...

984
01:24:38,893 --> 01:24:40,684
...about the marriage.

985
01:24:41,353 --> 01:24:43,096
On what compulsion is the oath?

986
01:24:44,355 --> 01:24:46,680
-High treason.
-But what is the wording?

987
01:24:46,774 --> 01:24:49,146
Do the words matter?
We know what it means.

988
01:24:49,234 --> 01:24:50,349
Tell me the words.

989
01:24:50,444 --> 01:24:53,148
An oath is made of words.
It may be possible to take it.

990
01:24:53,238 --> 01:24:53,854
Take it?

991
01:24:54,155 --> 01:24:56,361
And if it can be taken,
you must take it, too.

992
01:24:57,450 --> 01:24:58,114
No!

993
01:24:58,200 --> 01:25:02,612
Listen, Meg. God made the angels
to show him splendour.

994
01:25:03,121 --> 01:25:07,829
As he made animals for innocence
and plants for their simplicity.

995
01:25:07,958 --> 01:25:12,785
But Man he made to serve him wittily,
in the tangle of his mind.

996
01:25:13,254 --> 01:25:16,587
If he suffers us to come to such a case
that there is no escaping...

997
01:25:16,674 --> 01:25:19,508
...then we may stand to our tackle
as best we can.

998
01:25:19,593 --> 01:25:24,633
And yes, Meg, then we can clamour
like champions, if we have the spittle for it.

999
01:25:24,972 --> 01:25:28,921
But it's God's part, not our own,
to bring ourselves to such a pass.

1000
01:25:29,017 --> 01:25:32,386
Our natural business lies in escaping.

1001
01:25:34,605 --> 01:25:36,597
If I can take this oath, I will.

1002
01:25:41,694 --> 01:25:43,521
I would, for my sake,
you could take the oath.

1003
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:46,186
I never took a man into the Tower
less willingly.

1004
01:25:46,615 --> 01:25:48,442
Thank you, Master Governor.

1005
01:25:51,452 --> 01:25:52,828
Thank you.

1006
01:25:55,122 --> 01:25:56,285
Sir Thomas.

1007
01:27:29,909 --> 01:27:31,107
Sir Thomas.

1008
01:27:34,287 --> 01:27:35,532
Sir Thomas!

1009
01:27:56,222 --> 01:27:58,214
This is iniquitous.

1010
01:28:01,977 --> 01:28:04,349
-Where to this time?
-Richmond Palace.

1011
01:29:01,484 --> 01:29:02,812
Sit down.

1012
01:29:10,450 --> 01:29:13,653
This is the Seventh Commission
to inquire into the case...

1013
01:29:13,744 --> 01:29:16,745
...of Sir Thomas More, appointed
by His Majesty's Council.

1014
01:29:16,830 --> 01:29:18,787
Have you anything to say?

1015
01:29:18,874 --> 01:29:19,953
No.

1016
01:29:22,794 --> 01:29:24,750
-Seen this document before?
-Many times.

1017
01:29:24,837 --> 01:29:26,461
It is the Act of Succession.

1018
01:29:26,547 --> 01:29:29,037
These are the names
of those who have sworn to it.

1019
01:29:29,132 --> 01:29:32,133
-I have, as you say, seen it before.
-Will you swear to it?

1020
01:29:32,218 --> 01:29:33,297
No.

1021
01:29:34,136 --> 01:29:36,093
Thomas, we must know--

1022
01:29:40,141 --> 01:29:44,304
We must know plainly whether you
recognise the offspring of Queen Anne...

1023
01:29:44,395 --> 01:29:46,387
...as heirs to the throne.

1024
01:29:46,480 --> 01:29:49,101
The King in parliament
tells me that they are.

1025
01:29:49,190 --> 01:29:51,728
-Of course I recognise them.
-Will you swear to it?

1026
01:29:51,818 --> 01:29:54,818
-Yes.
-Then why won't he swear to the act?

1027
01:29:54,903 --> 01:29:57,738
Because there is more than that in the act.

1028
01:29:57,822 --> 01:30:02,365
Just so. Sir Thomas, it states in the
preamble that the King's former marriage...

1029
01:30:02,451 --> 01:30:04,444
...to the Lady Catherine was unlawful...

1030
01:30:04,536 --> 01:30:09,244
...she being his brother's widow and
the Pope having no authority to sanction it.

1031
01:30:10,500 --> 01:30:12,408
Is that what you deny?

1032
01:30:18,381 --> 01:30:20,457
Is that what you dispute?

1033
01:30:26,972 --> 01:30:29,889
Is that what you are not sure of?

1034
01:30:36,104 --> 01:30:40,564
You insult His Majesty and Council
in the person of the Lord Archbishop!

1035
01:30:40,649 --> 01:30:41,894
I insult no one.

1036
01:30:41,984 --> 01:30:45,851
I will not take the oath.
I will not tell you why I will not.

1037
01:30:45,987 --> 01:30:49,521
-Then your reasons must be treasonable!
-Not "must be," may be.

1038
01:30:49,615 --> 01:30:51,323
It's a fair assumption!

1039
01:30:51,408 --> 01:30:55,275
The law requires more than an assumption,
the law requires a fact.

1040
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:58,573
Of course, I cannot judge
your legal standing in the case...

1041
01:30:58,664 --> 01:31:01,499
...but until I know the ground
of your objections...

1042
01:31:01,583 --> 01:31:05,580
...I can only guess
your spiritual standing, too.

1043
01:31:05,962 --> 01:31:09,911
If you're willing to guess that, it should be
small matter to guess my objections.

1044
01:31:10,007 --> 01:31:11,999
Then you do have objections to the act?

1045
01:31:12,092 --> 01:31:13,919
Well, we know that, Cromwell!

1046
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:15,511
No, my lord, you don't.

1047
01:31:15,595 --> 01:31:19,544
You may suppose I have objections,
all you know is that I will not swear to it...

1048
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:22,676
...for which you cannot lawfully
harm me further.

1049
01:31:22,934 --> 01:31:27,477
But if you were right in supposing me
to have objections, and right again...

1050
01:31:27,563 --> 01:31:30,101
...in supposing my objections
to be treasonable...

1051
01:31:30,190 --> 01:31:33,523
...the law would let you cut my head off.

1052
01:31:35,028 --> 01:31:36,652
Oh, yes.

1053
01:31:37,822 --> 01:31:39,446
Well done, Sir Thomas.

1054
01:31:39,531 --> 01:31:43,528
I've been trying to make that clear
to His Grace for some time.

1055
01:31:43,618 --> 01:31:45,906
Oh, confound all this! I'm not a scholar.

1056
01:31:45,995 --> 01:31:48,153
I don't know if the marriage
was lawful or not...

1057
01:31:48,247 --> 01:31:50,323
...but damn it, Thomas,
look at these names.

1058
01:31:50,832 --> 01:31:54,283
Why can't you do as I did,
and come with us, for fellowship?

1059
01:31:55,753 --> 01:31:59,501
And when we die, and you are sent
to heaven for doing your conscience...

1060
01:31:59,590 --> 01:32:04,630
...and I am sent to hell for not doing mine,
will you come with me, for fellowship?

1061
01:32:05,928 --> 01:32:09,213
So, those of us whose names are there,
are damned, Sir Thomas?

1062
01:32:09,306 --> 01:32:12,306
I have no window to look into
another man's conscience.

1063
01:32:12,392 --> 01:32:13,672
I condemn no one.

1064
01:32:13,768 --> 01:32:16,341
-Then the matter is capable of question?
-Certainly.

1065
01:32:16,437 --> 01:32:19,686
But that you owe obedience to the King
is not capable of question.

1066
01:32:19,773 --> 01:32:22,976
So weigh a doubt against a certainty
and sign.

1067
01:32:25,945 --> 01:32:30,985
Some men think the earth is round,
others think it flat.

1068
01:32:31,199 --> 01:32:33,737
It is a matter capable of question.

1069
01:32:34,535 --> 01:32:38,828
But if it is flat,
will the King's command make it round?

1070
01:32:38,914 --> 01:32:42,247
And if it is round,
will the King's command flatten it?

1071
01:32:43,084 --> 01:32:45,954
No, I will not sign.

1072
01:32:46,378 --> 01:32:49,794
Then you have more regard for
your own doubt than the King's command?

1073
01:32:49,881 --> 01:32:52,169
-For myself I have no doubt.
-No doubt of what?

1074
01:32:52,258 --> 01:32:54,546
No doubt that I will not take this oath.

1075
01:32:54,635 --> 01:32:58,928
But why I will not, you,
Master Secretary, will not trick out of me.

1076
01:32:59,347 --> 01:33:02,217
I might get it out of you in other ways.

1077
01:33:03,476 --> 01:33:06,049
You threaten like a dockside bully.

1078
01:33:06,228 --> 01:33:07,473
How should I threaten?

1079
01:33:07,562 --> 01:33:11,394
Like a minister of state, with justice!

1080
01:33:12,108 --> 01:33:14,729
Justice is what you're threatened with.

1081
01:33:14,860 --> 01:33:16,734
Then I am not threatened.

1082
01:33:23,117 --> 01:33:25,405
Gentlemen, can't I go to bed?

1083
01:33:25,619 --> 01:33:28,074
Aye. The prisoner may retire
as he requests.

1084
01:33:28,163 --> 01:33:31,329
-Unless you--
-I see no purpose in prolonging this.

1085
01:33:35,335 --> 01:33:38,455
Then, goodnight, Thomas.

1086
01:33:43,634 --> 01:33:46,124
May I have one or two more books?

1087
01:33:47,012 --> 01:33:48,506
Why, you have books?

1088
01:33:48,972 --> 01:33:49,837
Yes.

1089
01:33:49,931 --> 01:33:52,468
I didn't know, you shouldn't have.

1090
01:34:00,731 --> 01:34:02,558
May I see my family?

1091
01:34:02,650 --> 01:34:03,729
No.

1092
01:34:10,197 --> 01:34:11,228
Captain!

1093
01:34:11,532 --> 01:34:13,240
Master Secretary?

1094
01:34:14,076 --> 01:34:17,693
Have you ever heard the prisoner speak
of the King's divorce, supremacy...

1095
01:34:17,787 --> 01:34:20,075
-...or the King's marriage?
-No, not a word.

1096
01:34:20,164 --> 01:34:22,868
If he does, you will repeat it to me.

1097
01:34:23,875 --> 01:34:25,250
Of course.

1098
01:34:30,381 --> 01:34:31,246
Rich.

1099
01:34:31,382 --> 01:34:32,247
Secretary?

1100
01:34:32,341 --> 01:34:35,045
Tomorrow morning,
remove the prisoner's books.

1101
01:34:35,218 --> 01:34:36,926
Is that necessary?

1102
01:34:37,011 --> 01:34:40,047
With regards to this case,
the King is becoming impatient.

1103
01:34:40,139 --> 01:34:42,012
-Aye, with you.
-With all of us.

1104
01:34:42,099 --> 01:34:45,384
The King's impatience
will embrace a duke or two.

1105
01:34:55,193 --> 01:34:56,651
Master Secretary.

1106
01:34:58,612 --> 01:35:00,770
Sir Redvers Llewellyn has retired.

1107
01:35:01,782 --> 01:35:03,821
The Attorney General for Wales.

1108
01:35:04,075 --> 01:35:05,866
His post is vacant.

1109
01:35:06,994 --> 01:35:09,200
You said that I might approach you.

1110
01:35:10,372 --> 01:35:12,329
Not now, Rich.

1111
01:35:15,418 --> 01:35:17,624
He must submit. He must!

1112
01:35:18,796 --> 01:35:19,827
Rack him.

1113
01:35:23,842 --> 01:35:27,541
No. The King's conscience
will not permit it.

1114
01:35:27,928 --> 01:35:30,300
We have to find some other way.

1115
01:35:39,605 --> 01:35:41,015
Sir Thomas!

1116
01:35:43,441 --> 01:35:44,271
Father!

1117
01:35:44,358 --> 01:35:45,734
What? Margaret?

1118
01:35:46,610 --> 01:35:48,104
Father!

1119
01:35:48,820 --> 01:35:51,987
Meg. For God's sake,
they haven't put you in here?

1120
01:35:52,073 --> 01:35:54,480
-No, sir, a visit.
-A brief one, Sir Thomas.

1121
01:35:54,575 --> 01:35:55,986
Father.

1122
01:35:57,036 --> 01:35:59,360
-Good morning, husband.
-Good morning.

1123
01:36:02,957 --> 01:36:04,748
Good morning, Will.

1124
01:36:10,130 --> 01:36:12,455
Well, this is a hellish place!

1125
01:36:12,715 --> 01:36:15,751
Except it's keeping me from you,
my dears, it isn't so bad.

1126
01:36:15,843 --> 01:36:17,586
It's remarkably like any other place.

1127
01:36:17,678 --> 01:36:20,595
-lt drips!
-Yes. It's too near the river.

1128
01:36:32,482 --> 01:36:33,596
Well, what is it?

1129
01:36:36,068 --> 01:36:39,602
Father, come out!
Swear to the act and come out!

1130
01:36:41,823 --> 01:36:43,981
Is this why they've let you come?

1131
01:36:44,116 --> 01:36:45,147
Yes.

1132
01:36:47,869 --> 01:36:50,111
Meg's under oath to persuade you.

1133
01:36:51,789 --> 01:36:53,616
That was silly, Meg.

1134
01:37:01,964 --> 01:37:04,122
How do you plan to do that?

1135
01:37:06,176 --> 01:37:07,374
Father.

1136
01:37:08,011 --> 01:37:11,545
"God more regards the thoughts
of the heart than the words of the mouth."

1137
01:37:11,639 --> 01:37:14,011
-Well, so you've always told me.
-Yes.

1138
01:37:14,099 --> 01:37:17,265
Then say the words of the oath
and in your heart think otherwise.

1139
01:37:17,352 --> 01:37:20,601
What is an oath then,
but words we say to God?

1140
01:37:27,277 --> 01:37:28,557
Listen, Meg.

1141
01:37:29,362 --> 01:37:33,441
When a man takes an oath, he's holding
his own self in his own hands...

1142
01:37:33,740 --> 01:37:35,021
...Iike water.

1143
01:37:35,242 --> 01:37:40,282
And if he opens his fingers then,
he needn't hope to find himself again.

1144
01:37:41,497 --> 01:37:46,407
Some men aren't capable of this, but I'd be
loathed to think your father one of them.

1145
01:37:49,545 --> 01:37:51,917
-I have another argument.
-Oh, Meg.

1146
01:37:52,214 --> 01:37:57,373
In any state that was half good,
you would be raised up high, not here...

1147
01:37:57,552 --> 01:38:00,552
-...for what you've done already.
-All right.

1148
01:38:00,888 --> 01:38:03,509
It's not your fault
the state's three-quarters bad.

1149
01:38:03,598 --> 01:38:04,345
No.

1150
01:38:04,432 --> 01:38:07,053
If you elect to suffer for it,
you elect to be a hero.

1151
01:38:07,143 --> 01:38:08,685
That's very neat.

1152
01:38:09,186 --> 01:38:13,515
But look now. If we lived in a state
where virtue was profitable...

1153
01:38:13,857 --> 01:38:16,145
...common sense would make us saintly.

1154
01:38:16,234 --> 01:38:20,646
But since we see that avarice, anger,
pride and stupidity...

1155
01:38:20,904 --> 01:38:25,898
...commonly profit far beyond charity,
modesty, justice and thought...

1156
01:38:26,075 --> 01:38:28,648
...perhaps we must stand fast a little...

1157
01:38:28,828 --> 01:38:31,318
...even at the risk of being heroes.

1158
01:38:36,000 --> 01:38:37,411
But in reason!

1159
01:38:37,501 --> 01:38:40,952
Haven't you done as much
as God can reasonably want?

1160
01:38:45,716 --> 01:38:49,630
Well, finally it isn't a matter of reason.

1161
01:38:49,761 --> 01:38:52,133
Finally, it's a matter of love.

1162
01:38:55,391 --> 01:38:58,510
You're content then to be shut up here
with mice and rats...

1163
01:38:58,602 --> 01:39:00,890
-...when you might be home with us?
-Content?

1164
01:39:00,979 --> 01:39:06,185
If they'd open a crack that wide, I'd be
through it like a bird and back to Chelsea.

1165
01:39:10,821 --> 01:39:13,525
I haven't told you
what the house is like without you.

1166
01:39:13,615 --> 01:39:14,777
Don't, Meg.

1167
01:39:14,866 --> 01:39:18,115
-What we do in the evening without you.
-Meg, have done.

1168
01:39:18,202 --> 01:39:20,443
We don't read because we've no candles.

1169
01:39:20,662 --> 01:39:23,532
We don't talk because we wonder
what they're doing to you.

1170
01:39:23,623 --> 01:39:26,327
The King is more merciful.
He doesn't use the rack.

1171
01:39:26,417 --> 01:39:28,160
Two minutes to go, sir.

1172
01:39:28,252 --> 01:39:30,920
-I thought you'd like to know.
-Two minutes!

1173
01:39:31,546 --> 01:39:34,083
-Jailer!
-Sorry, sir. Two minutes.

1174
01:39:35,883 --> 01:39:39,797
Listen, you must leave the country.
All of you must leave the country.

1175
01:39:39,886 --> 01:39:41,878
-And leave you?
-lt makes no difference.

1176
01:39:41,971 --> 01:39:43,762
They won't let me see you again.

1177
01:39:43,848 --> 01:39:46,765
You must all go on the same day,
but not on the same boat.

1178
01:39:46,850 --> 01:39:50,183
-Different boats from different ports.
-After the trial, then.

1179
01:39:50,270 --> 01:39:52,843
There'll be no trial, they have no case.

1180
01:39:54,440 --> 01:39:56,432
Do this for me, I beseech you.

1181
01:39:56,567 --> 01:39:58,393
-Will?
-Yes, sir.

1182
01:39:58,485 --> 01:40:00,311
-Margaret?
-Yes.

1183
01:40:00,987 --> 01:40:02,018
Alice?

1184
01:40:07,993 --> 01:40:10,744
-Alice, I command you!
-Right.

1185
01:40:18,126 --> 01:40:20,118
This is splendid.

1186
01:40:20,837 --> 01:40:23,707
-I know who packed this.
-I packed it.

1187
01:40:23,797 --> 01:40:24,828
Yes.

1188
01:40:27,592 --> 01:40:30,165
You still make a superlative custard, Alice.

1189
01:40:30,261 --> 01:40:31,340
Do l?

1190
01:40:33,889 --> 01:40:36,214
That's a nice dress you have on.

1191
01:40:37,559 --> 01:40:39,302
Nice colour anyway.

1192
01:40:39,602 --> 01:40:41,725
My God, you think little of me!

1193
01:40:42,313 --> 01:40:43,261
I know I'm a fool...

1194
01:40:43,355 --> 01:40:46,605
...but I'm not such a fool
as to be lamenting for my dresses...

1195
01:40:46,691 --> 01:40:49,146
...or to relish complimenting
on my custards.

1196
01:40:49,318 --> 01:40:51,026
I'm well rebuked.

1197
01:40:52,404 --> 01:40:54,029
-Alice--
-No!

1198
01:40:57,200 --> 01:41:01,991
I'm sick with fear when I think of the worst
they may do to me.

1199
01:41:02,162 --> 01:41:07,286
But worse than that will be to go
with you not understanding why I go.

1200
01:41:07,375 --> 01:41:08,406
I don't.

1201
01:41:08,501 --> 01:41:13,660
If you can tell me that you understand,
I might make a good death, if I have to.

1202
01:41:13,755 --> 01:41:17,966
-Your death's no good to me.
-You must tell me that you understand.

1203
01:41:18,051 --> 01:41:19,213
I don't!

1204
01:41:19,593 --> 01:41:21,385
I don't believe this had to happen!

1205
01:41:21,470 --> 01:41:23,711
If you say that
I don't see how I'm to face it.

1206
01:41:23,805 --> 01:41:25,133
It's the truth!

1207
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:28,723
-You're an honest woman.
-Much good may it do me.

1208
01:41:29,518 --> 01:41:31,724
I'll tell you what I'm afraid of...

1209
01:41:31,812 --> 01:41:34,729
...that when you've gone,
I shall hate you for it.

1210
01:41:39,151 --> 01:41:40,859
You mustn't, Alice.

1211
01:41:44,364 --> 01:41:45,644
You mustn't.

1212
01:41:50,369 --> 01:41:54,697
As for understanding, I understand you're
the best man I ever met or ever likely to.

1213
01:41:55,165 --> 01:42:00,122
And if you go, God knows why I suppose,
though as God's my witness...

1214
01:42:00,210 --> 01:42:02,452
...God's kept deadly quiet about it.

1215
01:42:03,171 --> 01:42:07,215
And if any one wants to know
my opinion of the King and his Council...

1216
01:42:07,341 --> 01:42:10,010
...he only has to ask for it!

1217
01:42:13,596 --> 01:42:16,929
Why, it's a lion I married.

1218
01:42:17,183 --> 01:42:18,974
A lion. A lion.

1219
01:42:24,897 --> 01:42:27,139
This is good.

1220
01:42:29,860 --> 01:42:31,235
It's very good.

1221
01:42:32,028 --> 01:42:33,736
Sorry, Sir Thomas!

1222
01:42:34,197 --> 01:42:36,355
-Oh, for pity's sake!
-Time's up, sir.

1223
01:42:36,449 --> 01:42:39,283
-But one more minute!
-You don't know what you're asking.

1224
01:42:39,368 --> 01:42:41,241
-Come along, Miss.
-For heaven's sake.

1225
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:43,071
Now, don't do that, sir.

1226
01:42:45,998 --> 01:42:48,323
Now, madam, don't make trouble.

1227
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:53,577
Come along, please, Lady Alice.

1228
01:42:57,466 --> 01:42:59,791
Take your muddy paws off me!

1229
01:43:00,343 --> 01:43:03,427
Filthy, stinking, gutter-fed, turnkey!

1230
01:43:04,180 --> 01:43:06,468
I'll see you suffer for this!

1231
01:43:07,724 --> 01:43:08,969
Goodbye.

1232
01:43:24,113 --> 01:43:26,485
You must understand my position, sir.

1233
01:43:26,823 --> 01:43:30,441
I'm a plain, simple man
and I just want to keep out of trouble.

1234
01:43:40,335 --> 01:43:44,960
Dear Lord Jesus, my soul Saviour,
clear my wits.

1235
01:43:46,298 --> 01:43:50,591
Dear Lady, Blessed Mother of God,
comfort my wife and daughter...

1236
01:43:51,552 --> 01:43:53,591
...and forgive me for them.

1237
01:44:58,065 --> 01:45:02,525
Sir Thomas More, though you have
heinously offended the King's majesty...

1238
01:45:02,611 --> 01:45:07,770
...we hope that if you'll even now
forethink and repent of obstinate opinion...

1239
01:45:08,199 --> 01:45:10,985
...you may still taste his gracious pardon.

1240
01:45:12,369 --> 01:45:14,242
My lords, I thank you.

1241
01:45:14,996 --> 01:45:17,487
As for the matters
you may charge me with...

1242
01:45:17,582 --> 01:45:21,365
...I fear from my present weakness,
that neither my wit...

1243
01:45:21,460 --> 01:45:23,701
...nor my memory will serve...

1244
01:45:24,337 --> 01:45:26,329
...to make sufficient answer.

1245
01:45:27,632 --> 01:45:29,920
I should be glad to sit down.

1246
01:45:30,092 --> 01:45:31,835
A chair for the prisoner.

1247
01:45:46,314 --> 01:45:48,555
Master Secretary Cromwell,
have you the charge?

1248
01:45:48,649 --> 01:45:51,056
-I have, my lord.
-Then read the charge.

1249
01:45:54,779 --> 01:45:58,064
"That you did wilfully and maliciously
deny and deprive...

1250
01:45:58,157 --> 01:46:01,988
"...our liege, Lord Henry,
of his undoubted certain title...

1251
01:46:02,243 --> 01:46:05,160
"...Supreme Head of the Church
in England."

1252
01:46:06,664 --> 01:46:09,949
But, I have never denied this title.

1253
01:46:12,335 --> 01:46:16,166
At Westminster Hall, at Lambeth,
and again at Richmond...

1254
01:46:16,297 --> 01:46:18,787
...you stubbornly refused the oath.

1255
01:46:18,966 --> 01:46:20,294
Was this no denial?

1256
01:46:20,383 --> 01:46:22,459
No, this was silence.

1257
01:46:22,802 --> 01:46:26,135
And for my silence,
I am punished with imprisonment.

1258
01:46:27,431 --> 01:46:31,642
-Why have I been called again?
-On a charge of high treason, Sir Thomas.

1259
01:46:32,435 --> 01:46:35,471
For which the punishment
is not imprisonment.

1260
01:46:35,896 --> 01:46:36,975
Death...

1261
01:46:37,523 --> 01:46:39,894
...comes for us all, my lords.

1262
01:46:40,191 --> 01:46:42,397
Yes, even for kings he comes.

1263
01:46:42,485 --> 01:46:45,569
The death of kings is not in question,
Sir Thomas.

1264
01:46:45,821 --> 01:46:48,857
Nor mine, I trust, until I'm proven guilty.

1265
01:46:48,990 --> 01:46:52,406
Your life lies in your own hands, Thomas,
as it always has!

1266
01:46:52,493 --> 01:46:54,320
Is that so, my lord?

1267
01:46:54,954 --> 01:46:56,697
Then I'll keep a good grip on it.

1268
01:47:03,669 --> 01:47:05,246
So, Sir Thomas...

1269
01:47:05,838 --> 01:47:07,877
...you stand on your silence?

1270
01:47:08,548 --> 01:47:09,711
I do.

1271
01:47:10,466 --> 01:47:12,542
But, gentlemen of the jury...

1272
01:47:13,344 --> 01:47:16,130
...there are many kinds of silence.

1273
01:47:16,596 --> 01:47:19,716
Consider first the silence of a man
when he is dead.

1274
01:47:20,058 --> 01:47:23,224
Suppose we go into the room
where he is laid out and we listen.

1275
01:47:23,310 --> 01:47:24,473
What do we hear?

1276
01:47:25,979 --> 01:47:27,259
Silence.

1277
01:47:27,731 --> 01:47:30,850
What does it betoken, this silence?

1278
01:47:31,442 --> 01:47:34,111
Nothing. This is silence pure and simple.

1279
01:47:34,445 --> 01:47:36,236
But let us take another case.

1280
01:47:36,321 --> 01:47:39,191
Suppose I were to take a dagger
from my sleeve...

1281
01:47:39,282 --> 01:47:41,274
...and make to kill the prisoner with it.

1282
01:47:41,367 --> 01:47:45,695
And my lordships there, instead of crying
out for me to stop, maintain their silence.

1283
01:47:45,787 --> 01:47:47,696
That would betoken!

1284
01:47:47,997 --> 01:47:51,330
It would betoken a willingness
that I should do it.

1285
01:47:51,542 --> 01:47:54,459
And under the law,
they would be guilty with me.

1286
01:47:55,420 --> 01:47:59,120
So silence can,
according to the circumstances...

1287
01:48:00,049 --> 01:48:01,163
...speak.

1288
01:48:01,842 --> 01:48:06,219
Let us consider now the circumstances
of the prisoner's silence.

1289
01:48:06,846 --> 01:48:10,630
The oath was put to loyal subjects
all over the country who all declared...

1290
01:48:10,724 --> 01:48:12,882
...His Grace's title to be just and good!

1291
01:48:12,976 --> 01:48:16,060
But when it came to the prisoner,
he refused!

1292
01:48:17,980 --> 01:48:20,305
He calls this "silence."

1293
01:48:21,483 --> 01:48:24,235
Yet, is there a man in this court....

1294
01:48:25,028 --> 01:48:27,981
Is there a man in this country...

1295
01:48:28,281 --> 01:48:32,527
...who does not know
Sir Thomas More's opinion of this title?

1296
01:48:35,203 --> 01:48:37,029
Yet, how can this be?

1297
01:48:37,413 --> 01:48:40,367
Because this silence betokened...

1298
01:48:40,874 --> 01:48:45,785
...nay, this silence was not silence at all,
but most eloquent denial!

1299
01:48:48,339 --> 01:48:49,584
Not so.

1300
01:48:51,508 --> 01:48:53,251
Not so, Master Secretary.

1301
01:48:56,054 --> 01:48:59,386
The maxim of the law is,
"Silence gives consent."

1302
01:48:59,473 --> 01:49:02,592
If, therefore, you wish to construe
what my silence betokened...

1303
01:49:02,684 --> 01:49:06,895
...you must construe that I consented,
not that I denied.

1304
01:49:08,189 --> 01:49:11,023
Is that in fact what the world
construes from it?

1305
01:49:11,108 --> 01:49:14,393
Do you pretend that is what you wish
the world to construe from it?

1306
01:49:14,485 --> 01:49:17,770
The world must construe
according to its wits.

1307
01:49:17,947 --> 01:49:21,196
This court must construe
according to the law.

1308
01:49:30,749 --> 01:49:33,702
My lords, I wish to call Sir Richard Rich!

1309
01:49:35,378 --> 01:49:38,129
Richard Rich, come into court.

1310
01:49:38,422 --> 01:49:40,082
Richard Rich!

1311
01:50:01,399 --> 01:50:05,099
"l do swear the evidence I'll give
before the court shall be the truth...

1312
01:50:05,194 --> 01:50:07,566
"...the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth."

1313
01:50:07,654 --> 01:50:09,362
"So help me God," sir.

1314
01:50:09,781 --> 01:50:11,192
"So help me God."

1315
01:50:13,993 --> 01:50:17,741
Now Rich, on May 12,
you were at the Tower?

1316
01:50:18,038 --> 01:50:19,746
-I was.
-For what purpose?

1317
01:50:19,831 --> 01:50:22,119
I was sent to carry away
the prisoner's books.

1318
01:50:22,208 --> 01:50:24,449
-Did you talk with the prisoner?
-Yes.

1319
01:50:24,543 --> 01:50:27,294
Did you talk of the King's supremacy
of the Church?

1320
01:50:27,379 --> 01:50:28,410
Yes.

1321
01:50:28,713 --> 01:50:30,338
What did you say?

1322
01:50:31,007 --> 01:50:34,091
I said to him, "Supposing there were
an act of parliament...

1323
01:50:34,176 --> 01:50:36,845
"...to say that l, Richard Rich,
were to be king.

1324
01:50:36,928 --> 01:50:39,845
"Would not you, Master More,
take me for king?"

1325
01:50:40,056 --> 01:50:41,515
"That I would," he said.

1326
01:50:45,269 --> 01:50:47,557
"For then you would be king."

1327
01:50:49,981 --> 01:50:51,012
Yes?

1328
01:50:52,316 --> 01:50:55,815
Then he said,
"But I will put you a higher case.

1329
01:50:56,528 --> 01:51:01,522
"How, if there were an act of parliament,
to say that God should not be God?"

1330
01:51:01,907 --> 01:51:04,612
-This is true and then you said--
-Silence!

1331
01:51:05,243 --> 01:51:06,441
Continue.

1332
01:51:09,122 --> 01:51:12,988
But then I said,
"l will put you a middle case.

1333
01:51:13,500 --> 01:51:16,169
"Parliament has made our King
Head of the Church.

1334
01:51:16,253 --> 01:51:18,245
"Why will you not accept him?"

1335
01:51:21,674 --> 01:51:22,753
Well?

1336
01:51:26,177 --> 01:51:29,961
And then he said,
"Parliament had not the power to do it."

1337
01:51:31,724 --> 01:51:33,965
Repeat the prisoner's words.

1338
01:51:35,769 --> 01:51:36,848
He said:

1339
01:51:38,271 --> 01:51:40,761
"Parliament had not the competence."

1340
01:51:43,358 --> 01:51:45,232
Or words to that effect.

1341
01:51:45,527 --> 01:51:47,685
He denied the title!

1342
01:51:48,029 --> 01:51:49,357
He did.

1343
01:51:57,578 --> 01:52:02,489
In good faith, Rich,
I am sorrier for your perjury than my peril.

1344
01:52:02,624 --> 01:52:05,245
-Do you deny this?
-Yes!

1345
01:52:05,835 --> 01:52:09,085
You know if I were a man
who heeded not the taking of an oath...

1346
01:52:09,171 --> 01:52:10,630
...I need not be here.

1347
01:52:11,215 --> 01:52:13,705
Now, I will take an oath.

1348
01:52:15,552 --> 01:52:18,422
If what Master Rich has said is true...

1349
01:52:18,846 --> 01:52:22,795
...I pray I may never see God in the face.

1350
01:52:23,850 --> 01:52:27,550
Which I would not say, were it otherwise,
for anything on earth!

1351
01:52:27,687 --> 01:52:30,391
-That is not evidence.
-ls it probable....

1352
01:52:31,189 --> 01:52:35,767
Is it probable
that after so long a silence on this...

1353
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:38,433
...the very point so urgently sought of me...

1354
01:52:38,529 --> 01:52:42,312
...I should open my mind
to such a man as that?

1355
01:52:43,908 --> 01:52:47,277
Sir Richard, do you wish
to modify your testimony?

1356
01:52:48,412 --> 01:52:49,526
No, my lord.

1357
01:52:49,621 --> 01:52:52,242
Is there anything you wish
to take away from it?

1358
01:52:52,332 --> 01:52:53,446
No, my lord.

1359
01:52:53,541 --> 01:52:55,415
Have you anything to add?

1360
01:52:55,710 --> 01:52:56,990
No, my lord.

1361
01:52:58,295 --> 01:53:01,545
-Have you, Sir Thomas?
-To what purpose?

1362
01:53:05,509 --> 01:53:07,169
I am a dead man.

1363
01:53:10,889 --> 01:53:12,798
You have your will of me.

1364
01:53:13,933 --> 01:53:16,258
Then the witness may withdraw.

1365
01:53:23,608 --> 01:53:26,810
There is one question
I would like to ask the witness.

1366
01:53:29,362 --> 01:53:32,565
That's a chain of office you're wearing.
May I see it?

1367
01:53:40,622 --> 01:53:41,997
The Red Dragon.

1368
01:53:42,331 --> 01:53:43,529
What's this?

1369
01:53:43,624 --> 01:53:46,743
Sir Richard is appointed
Attorney General for Wales.

1370
01:53:46,960 --> 01:53:48,288
For Wales.

1371
01:53:49,838 --> 01:53:54,997
Why Richard, it profits a man nothing
to give his soul for the whole world.

1372
01:53:56,885 --> 01:53:58,379
But for Wales.

1373
01:54:06,768 --> 01:54:08,262
My lords! I've done.

1374
01:54:09,354 --> 01:54:11,975
The jury will retire
and consider the evidence.

1375
01:54:14,066 --> 01:54:18,644
Considering the evidence, it shouldn't
be necessary for them to retire.

1376
01:54:21,155 --> 01:54:22,815
Is it necessary?

1377
01:54:29,620 --> 01:54:32,372
Then is the prisoner guilty or not guilty?

1378
01:54:37,544 --> 01:54:39,203
Guilty, my lord!

1379
01:54:49,720 --> 01:54:53,504
Sir Thomas More,
you have been found guilty of high treason.

1380
01:54:53,640 --> 01:54:56,095
-The sentence of the court--
-My lords!

1381
01:54:56,893 --> 01:55:00,842
When I was practising the law,
the manner was to ask the prisoner...

1382
01:55:00,980 --> 01:55:04,893
...before pronouncing sentence,
if he had anything to say.

1383
01:55:05,275 --> 01:55:07,066
Have you anything to say?

1384
01:55:07,735 --> 01:55:08,766
Yes.

1385
01:55:19,912 --> 01:55:22,996
Since the court has determined
to condemn me...

1386
01:55:24,124 --> 01:55:25,867
...God knoweth how...

1387
01:55:26,959 --> 01:55:30,244
...I will now discharge my mind...

1388
01:55:30,838 --> 01:55:35,166
...concerning the indictment
and the King's title.

1389
01:55:38,719 --> 01:55:43,215
The indictment is grounded
in an act of parliament...

1390
01:55:43,598 --> 01:55:46,433
...which is directly repugnant...

1391
01:55:46,517 --> 01:55:50,182
...to the law of God and His Holy Church.

1392
01:55:50,354 --> 01:55:54,600
The supreme government of which
no temperable person...

1393
01:55:54,691 --> 01:55:58,854
...may by any law
presume to take upon him.

1394
01:55:59,737 --> 01:56:01,444
This was granted...

1395
01:56:02,197 --> 01:56:03,691
...by the mouth...

1396
01:56:04,449 --> 01:56:06,986
...of our Saviour, Christ Himself...

1397
01:56:07,868 --> 01:56:12,411
...to St. Peter and the bishops of Rome
whilst He lived...

1398
01:56:13,123 --> 01:56:16,408
...and was personally present...

1399
01:56:18,836 --> 01:56:20,460
...here on earth.

1400
01:56:22,714 --> 01:56:26,545
It is therefore insufficient in law...

1401
01:56:27,176 --> 01:56:30,129
...to charge any Christian to obey it.

1402
01:56:31,596 --> 01:56:33,090
And more than this...

1403
01:56:33,181 --> 01:56:38,008
...the immunity of the Church is promised
both in Magna Carta...

1404
01:56:38,143 --> 01:56:41,725
...and in the King's own coronation oath.

1405
01:56:43,564 --> 01:56:46,185
Now, we plainly see you are malicious!

1406
01:56:46,692 --> 01:56:47,937
Not so.

1407
01:56:50,362 --> 01:56:52,437
I am the King's true subject...

1408
01:56:53,322 --> 01:56:56,940
...and I pray for him and all the realm.

1409
01:56:58,744 --> 01:57:00,321
I do none harm.

1410
01:57:01,496 --> 01:57:03,369
I say none harm.

1411
01:57:04,373 --> 01:57:06,662
I think none harm.

1412
01:57:08,752 --> 01:57:11,788
And if this be not enough
to keep a man alive...

1413
01:57:12,213 --> 01:57:15,795
...then in good faith, I long not to live.

1414
01:57:17,884 --> 01:57:19,165
Nevertheless...

1415
01:57:20,136 --> 01:57:24,714
...it is not for the supremacy
that you have sought my blood...

1416
01:57:24,807 --> 01:57:29,018
...but because I would not bend
to the marriage!

1417
01:57:37,442 --> 01:57:40,561
You have been found guilty of high treason.

1418
01:57:41,404 --> 01:57:44,440
The sentence of the court
is that you be taken...

1419
01:57:44,573 --> 01:57:46,482
...to the Tower of London...

1420
01:57:48,618 --> 01:57:51,951
...until the day hence to the appointment...

1421
01:57:52,955 --> 01:57:55,031
...for your execution!

1422
01:58:10,636 --> 01:58:13,886
I am commanded by the King to be brief...

1423
01:58:14,640 --> 01:58:17,557
...and since I am
the King's obedient subject...

1424
01:58:18,101 --> 01:58:19,643
...brief I will be.

1425
01:58:21,145 --> 01:58:24,394
I die His Majesty's good servant...

1426
01:58:25,398 --> 01:58:26,976
...but God's first.

1427
01:58:33,822 --> 01:58:36,110
I forgive you, right readily.

1428
01:58:42,162 --> 01:58:44,451
Be not afraid of your office.

1429
01:58:44,873 --> 01:58:46,580
You send me to God.

1430
01:58:49,043 --> 01:58:51,000
You're very sure of that, Sir Thomas?

1431
01:58:51,086 --> 01:58:54,419
He will not refuse one who is so blithe
to go to him.

1432
01:59:17,191 --> 01:59:20,642
Thomas More's head was stuck
on Traitor's Gate for a month.

1433
01:59:20,736 --> 01:59:24,602
Then his daughter, Margaret,
removed it and kept it 'til her death.

1434
01:59:25,406 --> 01:59:29,320
Cromwell was beheaded for high treason
five years after More.

1435
01:59:29,827 --> 01:59:32,495
The Archbishop was burned at the stake.

1436
01:59:33,121 --> 01:59:36,287
The Duke of Norfolk should have
been executed for high treason...

1437
01:59:36,374 --> 01:59:39,374
...but the King died of syphilis
the night before.

1438
01:59:40,335 --> 01:59:43,252
Richard Rich became
Chancellor of England...

1439
01:59:43,880 --> 01:59:45,706
...and died in his bed.
