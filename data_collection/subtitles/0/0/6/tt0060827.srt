1
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,796
You wanted me, Doctor?

2
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,271
- Have you seen Mrs. Vogler...?
- No, not yet.

3
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,550
Then I'll tell you about her...

4
00:06:31,760 --> 00:06:34,957
and why you are to look after her.

5
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:40,153
She's an actress and played in
the last performance of "Electra".

6
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,234
She stopped dead in the middle 
of a scene...

7
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,795
and was silent for a minute.

8
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:06,315
Afterwards, she apologized...
and said she had got the giggles.

9
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,557
Next day she did not come to rehearsal.

10
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,071
The housekeeper found her still in bed.

11
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,397
She was awake, but didn't
speak or move.

12
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:22,320
She has been like this for 3 months...

13
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,988
and has had every possible test.

14
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:28,557
She seems to be quite healthy:

15
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,591
...mentally and physically.

16
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,076
Not even a hysterical reaction.

17
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,954
Is there nothing you want to ask?

18
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:40,671
Then you can go in to Mrs. Vogler.

19
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,870
How do you do, Mrs. Vogler.

20
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:53,872
I am Siter Alma.

21
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:57,390
I shall be looking after you.

22
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:04,630
I am twenty-five and engaged
to be married.

23
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,193
I graduated from nursing school
two years ago.

24
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:11,749
My parents have a farm.

25
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:15,113
Mother was also a nurse.

26
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:20,830
I'll go and get the dinner tray.

27
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,799
.

28
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,757
Another pillow?

29
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:27,599
Is that comfy?

30
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:37,550
What is your first impression?

31
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,595
I don't know what to say, Doctor.

32
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:44,357
At first her face seems so gentle.

33
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:46,551
Then you look at her eyes...

34
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:49,670
She looks so mean.

35
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:54,235
- Perhaps I'd better not...
- What were you going to say?

36
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,156
Maybe I'd better give up this case.

37
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,396
Did something frighten you?

38
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:04,112
Not exactly, but perhaps Mrs. Vogler
should have a nurse with more experience.

39
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,916
I may not be able to cope with her.

40
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,758
In what way?

41
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:13,435
- Mentally.
- Mentally?

42
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:18,033
If she won't speak or move
because she decides not to,

43
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:21,472
- which it must be if she isn't ill.
- And?

44
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,797
Then it shows she has great strength.

45
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,952
I may not be equal to it.

46
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:33,033
I thought you might like to
look at the twilight.

47
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,272
Shall I turn on the radio?

48
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,471
I think there is a play.

49
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:45,035
Forgive me, my darling...

50
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:48,239
...oh, you must forgive me.

51
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:52,035
Your forgiveness is all I crave...

52
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,399
What are you laughing at?
Is the actress so funny?

53
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,119
What do you know about compassion?!

54
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:05,436
What do you know about compassion?!

55
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:13,598
I don't know much about acting,
Mrs. Vogler.

56
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,199
I like the theatre,
but I don't go very often.

57
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,918
I have a tremendous admiration
for artists.

58
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,428
I think it is terribly important...

59
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:30,519
...especially for people with problems.

60
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:36,352
I shouldn't talk to you like that,
should I?

61
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:39,075
I'll try and find some music.

62
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:41,713
Is that all right?

63
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,869
Good night, Mrs. Vogler.
Sleep well.

64
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,993
Damn it!

65
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,717
How strange...

66
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,634
You can go about as you please...

67
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,630
...do almost anything you like.

68
00:12:53,520 --> 00:12:56,796
I'll marry Karl-Henrik,
and we'll have children.

69
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,871
That's all settled.

70
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:02,918
It's all inside me.

71
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,035
It's nothing to worry about.

72
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:09,191
It's a nice safe feeling.

73
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,313
Then I have work I like.

74
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:16,073
That's another good thing.

75
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,712
Though in a different way.

76
00:13:19,960 --> 00:13:21,313
But it's good...

77
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,035
It's good.

78
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,992
It's good.

79
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,873
I wonder just what's wrong with her.

80
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,717
Elisabeth Vogler.

81
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,958
Elisabeth.

82
00:15:18,920 --> 00:15:21,309
Would you like to open the letter,
Mrs. Vogler?

83
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:30,317
Shall I read it?

84
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:38,030
Shall I read it aloud to you?

85
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,031
"Dearest Elisabeth,

86
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,352
"Since you won't let me see you,
I'm writing.

87
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:54,757
"If you don't want to read my letter,
you needn't.

88
00:15:57,240 --> 00:16:01,597
"But I can't help seeking this
contact with you...

89
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,912
"since I am tormented by a question:

90
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:07,675
"Have I wronged you in some way?

91
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,633
"Have I hurt you without knowing it?

92
00:16:11,560 --> 00:16:15,235
"Has some awful misunderstanding
come between us?"

93
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,595
Do you really want me to go on?

94
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:34,552
"As far as I know, we were happy.

95
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,671
"I don't think we've ever been...

96
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:39,556
"so close to each other."

97
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:43,115
"Do you remember you said:

98
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:47,394
"Only now do I understand
what marriage is.

99
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:50,508
"You have taught me..."

100
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,910
I can't make it out...

101
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,068
"You have taught me..."

102
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:59,677
"You have taught me to look
at each other...

103
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:02,838
"...as if we were shy children,

104
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,669
"full of kindness and good resolutions,

105
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:08,959
"but ruled by forces..."

106
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:12,588
"ruled by forces...

107
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:15,155
"which we can only partly control."

108
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,549
"Do you remember saying all that?

109
00:17:20,080 --> 00:17:22,116
"We'd gone for a walk in the woods.

110
00:17:22,320 --> 00:17:25,073
"..and you suddenly grabbed my belt."

111
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:35,833
There's a photograph enclosed.

112
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:40,116
A snapshot of your son.
I don't know whether...

113
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,077
Do you want it, Mrs. Vogler?

114
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:47,110
He looks awfully nice!

115
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,950
Elisabeth, there's no point in your 
staying in the hospital.

116
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,751
Since you don't want to go home,

117
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,833
I suggest that you and Sister Alma
go to my summer place by the sea.

118
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,635
No?

119
00:18:34,120 --> 00:18:36,634
I understand all right.

120
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,514
The hopeless dream of "being"...

121
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,154
..not seeming, but "being".

122
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:47,709
At every waking moment,
alert.

123
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:53,357
The gulf between what you are with 
others...and what you are alone.

124
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:59,109
The vertigo and the constant hunger
to be appeased.

125
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:04,116
To be seen through,

126
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,631
and perhaps even wiped out.

127
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,835
Every inflexion and every gesture a lie

128
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,473
...every smile a grimace.

129
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:16,398
Suicide?

130
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,793
No.

131
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:20,638
Too vulgar.

132
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:22,479
But you can...

133
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,237
refuse to move..
refuse to talk.

134
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,352
..so that you don't have to lie.

135
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:32,076
You can shut yourself in,
on peut s'enfermer en soi.

136
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:35,517
Then you needn't play any parts or
make wrong gestures.

137
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:38,393
..or so you thought.

138
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,832
But reality is diabolical.

139
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,073
Your hiding-place isn't watertight.

140
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,999
Life trickles in from the outside.

141
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,316
And you're forced to react.

142
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:57,398
No one asks if it is true or false..

143
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,830
..if you're a genuine or just a sham.

144
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:04,917
Such things matter only in the theatre...
and hardly there either.

145
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:08,431
I understand, Elisabeth.

146
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:11,678
I understand why you don't speak,
why you don't move...

147
00:20:12,280 --> 00:20:16,034
...why you've created a part for
yourself out of apathy.

148
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,996
I understand and I admire.

149
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:24,678
You should go on with this part
until it is played out...

150
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:28,835
...until it loses interest for you.

151
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,116
Then you can leave it..

152
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,916
...just as you've left all your
other parts one by one.

153
00:20:37,920 --> 00:20:42,755
So Mrs. Vogler and Sister Alma
move out to the country.

154
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:47,519
The change agrees very well
with the actress.

155
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:52,318
The paralyzing apathy gives
way to long walks...

156
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:56,399
...fishing trips, cooking,
letter-writing...and other diversions.

157
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,555
Alma likes her rustic seclusion...

158
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,638
and takes good care of her patient.

159
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:46,158
That carries misfortune to compare its hands.

160
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:05,679
Elisabet?  

161
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:10,312
can I read you something?  I do not get out of order?  

162
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,160
It is written:  "All anxiety

163
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:16,557
"that we carry in us, all our opposed dreams,

164
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,158
"incomprehensible cruelty, our fear of disappearing,

165
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:24,239
"terrible concept of our condition

166
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:30,189
"slowly eroded our hope of hello in another world.  

167
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,270
"the cry of our faith and our doubts in the night

168
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:39,354
"is one of the most terrible evidence of our abandonment

169
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:42,632
"and of our terrified and unexpressed knowledge."  

170
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:45,470
That do you say some?  

171
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:52,432
I do not agree.  

172
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:57,474
To change...  The worst at home, it is that I am lazy.  

173
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,796
That gives me bad conscience.  

174
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,116
Karl-Henrik would like me more ambitious.  

175
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,108
It says that I live like a sleepwalker.  It is unjust.  

176
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,193
I left first my promotion.  

177
00:23:09,760 --> 00:23:11,193
It wants to say another thing.  

178
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,155
You know...  Oh, forgiveness.  

179
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:19,079
do You know with what I think sometimes?  

180
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,592
A the hospital, there is an old people's home

181
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:25,348
reserved to the nurses,

182
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:29,633
those which always lived only for their work.  

183
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,798
They have a small room.  

184
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,958
Ah, to devote its life to only one thing

185
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,715
I want to say to believe, to carry out something.  

186
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,275
Croire that its life has a direction.  

187
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,193
I like this idea.  

188
00:23:45,040 --> 00:23:47,838
to be held to with it obstinately, without conditions.  

189
00:23:48,040 --> 00:23:49,519
One should live thus.  

190
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:53,475
To count for the others.  You do not find?  

191
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,030
I know that that has the puerile air, but I believe in it.  

192
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:05,836
My God, it rains with pours!  

193
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,800
Oh yes.  It was married.  

194
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,356
We were lovers five years.  

195
00:24:12,560 --> 00:24:14,357
Then it was wearied, of course.  

196
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:18,717
I was very in love.  And it was my first.  

197
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:22,392
I remember it like long torment.  

198
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,997
Of long painful episodes and short moments...  

199
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:33,156
I think of it because you learned how to me to smoke.  It smoked enormously.  

200
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,074
With the proper perspective, I think that it is a true novel of station.

201
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:43,393
Oddly, that never really existed.  

202
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:47,155
I do not know how to describe that.  

203
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,393
I really did not exist for him.  

204
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:54,114
But my sorrow was quite real.  

205
00:24:56,040 --> 00:25:00,591
It is as if it formed part of all that painfully.  

206
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,396
As if that were to occur thus.  

207
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:07,069
Same what we say ourselves.  

208
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:18,277
One often says to me that I can listen.  It is funny, not?  

209
00:25:19,120 --> 00:25:21,554
One never really listened to me.  

210
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:24,513
Like you, you me listenings now.  

211
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:27,792
You are the first nobody who listens to me.  

212
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:32,758
That should not be interesting.  You could read in the place.  

213
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:35,753
I give that!  I do not irritate you?  

214
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:39,870
It is pleasant to speak.  That made hot in the heart.  

215
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:43,152
I had never felt that of all my life.  

216
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:49,712
I always wanted to have a sister.  But I have seven brothers.  

217
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:52,070
It is funny, I am the last.  

218
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:55,397
I was always surrounded boys.  

219
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:58,356
I like the boys.  

220
00:25:58,760 --> 00:26:02,389
You must know that, with your experiment of actress.  

221
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,475
I hold much in Karl-Henrik.  

222
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,714
But, you know, one likes only one time.  

223
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,877
I am faithful for him.  

224
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:15,157
With my trade, one has occasions, you know.  

225
00:26:19,200 --> 00:26:22,033
Karl-Henrik and me went to the sea.  

226
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:25,399
It was in June, it had only us there.  

227
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:31,677
One Karl-Henrik day went downtown and me, with the beach.  

228
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:34,834
It made very beautiful, very hot.  

229
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,510
There was another girl.  

230
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:42,071
It came from an island but had chosen our beach

231
00:26:42,280 --> 00:26:45,192
which was directed in the south and was relaxed.  

232
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:50,475
We lay, naked, coast at coast.  

233
00:26:50,800 --> 00:26:54,679
We slept, then we put sun oil.  

234
00:26:56,000 --> 00:27:00,039
Us portions both a cheap straw hat.  

235
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,309
Mine was decorated of a blue ribbon.  

236
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:08,680
I looked through my hat,

237
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,836
admiring the landscape, the sea and the sun.  

238
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,671
They was very curious.  

239
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:25,152
Suddenly, I live two silhouettes behind the rocks.  

240
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,998
They hid and observed us.  

241
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:35,151
"Two boys look at us", say I to Katarina, my neighbor.  

242
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,474
"Lets look at them", says it while being put on the back.  

243
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:44,030
It was a very strange feeling.  

244
00:27:44,800 --> 00:27:48,998
I wanted to run to put my shirt, but I remained motionless,

245
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:51,954
on the belly, the buttocks with the air,

246
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:55,038
by no means constrained and completely calms.  

247
00:27:58,200 --> 00:28:00,873
And Katarina were beside me,

248
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,878
with its centres and its thick thighs.  

249
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:07,711
Motionless, it gloussait a little with the catch one.  

250
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:15,709
I live that the boys had approached and looked at us.  

251
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:19,269
They were terribly young.  

252
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:24,355
Then one of two, the most courageous,

253
00:28:25,520 --> 00:28:28,956
approached and is squatted beside Katarina.  

254
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:34,316
It made mine be occupied playing with its foot in sand.  

255
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:38,790
I felt very funny.  

256
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:43,509
Suddenly, I intended Katarina to say:  

257
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,958
"Why don't you come?"  

258
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:52,359
Then it took the hand to him and helped it to strip itself.  

259
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:55,069
Abruptly, it was on it.  

260
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,871
It helped it to penetrate it by holding the buttocks to him.  

261
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,552
the other boy sat down and looked at them.  

262
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:08,435
I heard Katarina murmur and laugh.  

263
00:29:09,640 --> 00:29:12,234
the face of the boy was close to the mien.  

264
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:15,595
It very red and was inflated.  

265
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:22,713
I put abruptly on the back and say to him: "And me?"  

266
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,640
Katarina says to him:  "Goes on it."  

267
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:29,110
It was withdrawn from it and...  

268
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,160
it fell on me, very hard.  

269
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:36,268
It caught one of my centres. That made me very badly!  

270
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:42,279
I was ready and I wines immediately.You include/understand that?  

271
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:47,273
I was going to say: "Pay attention that I do not fall pregnant",

272
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:50,434
when it came. I felt...  

273
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,679
I had never felt before

274
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,633
this way of spreading its seed in me.  

275
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,238
It caught my shoulders and was cambered.  

276
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,431
I wines still and still.  

277
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:10,431
Katarina was on the side, looking at us and holding the back to him.  

278
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,509
When it came, it intertwined it

279
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,271
and masturbated with its hand.  

280
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:21,078
And when it came,

281
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,112
it shouted like insane.  

282
00:30:29,040 --> 00:30:31,759
Then one started to laughing all the three.  

283
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,193
One called the other boy, sitted on the slope.  

284
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:36,879
It was called Peter.  

285
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:45,395
It arrived, constrained, trembling of cold in spite of the sun.  

286
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,189
Katarina peeled off its trousers and played with him.  

287
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,079
When it enjoys, it took it in its mouth.  

288
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,479
It leaned and the back embraced to him.  

289
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:05,272
It was turned, took the head to him and its chest offered to him.  

290
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,870
Then the other boy and me, we started again.  

291
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:12,751
It was like the first time.  

292
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:17,869
Then one swam and one separated.  

293
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,197
When I returned, Karl-Henrik was already there.  

294
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:28,399
We dined and drank the red wine which it had brought.  

295
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,191
Then we made love.  

296
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:36,631
That was never also good, neither front nor afterwards.  

297
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,275
do You include/understand that?  

298
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,514
Obviously, I fell pregnant.  

299
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,950
Karl-Henrik, which studies medicine, made me fall through by a friend.  

300
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:52,996
We were happy, we did not want a child.

301
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,676
Step at this time, in any case.  

302
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:04,076
That does not have any direction.  

303
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:07,315
Nothing of all that is coherent.  

304
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:13,030
After, one has bad conscience for details. You include/understand?  

305
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,438
Which does become all it in what one believes?  

306
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,870
isn't necessary?  

307
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:24,675
can one be only one and even nobody at the same time?  

308
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:27,394
I, was I want to say two people?  

309
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,431
My God, I am ridiculous...  

310
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:33,711
I do not have any reason to put myself at pleurnicher.  

311
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,750
I will seek a handkerchief.  

312
00:32:57,640 --> 00:32:59,790
It is almost the morning...  

313
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,516
and it always rains.  

314
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,756
I spoke without me to stop. I spoke and you listened to me.  

315
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,672
You had to annoy you!  

316
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,155
In what can my life interest you?  

317
00:33:19,400 --> 00:33:21,277
It would be necessary to be like you.  

318
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:27,595
You know what I thought after having seen your film, the other evening,

319
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:30,155
by seeing me in the mirror?  

320
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,471
"We are similar."  

321
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:35,318
You are much prettier,

322
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,351
but we resemble each other in a direction.  

323
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,995
I believe that I could become you.  

324
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:42,270
If I made of it really the effort.  

325
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,232
I want to say, inside.  

326
00:33:46,200 --> 00:33:49,272
You, you could become me of a wink.  

327
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:55,150
But your heart would be too much large and would overflow of everywhere!  

328
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,872
You should go to lay down you or you will fall asleep on the table.  

329
00:34:16,320 --> 00:34:18,754
Yes, I should go to lay down me.  

330
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,991
Or I will fall asleep here.  

331
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:23,350
That would not be comfortable.  

332
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:28,354
Good night.  

333
00:37:21,640 --> 00:37:23,710
Say, Elisabet...  

334
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,070
You did this night speak to me?  

335
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,515
did You come to see me?  

336
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,870
I do your mail take too?  

337
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,151
can I drink?  

338
00:38:48,920 --> 00:38:50,273
Goodbye.  

339
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,671
Dear friend, I would like to live always thus.  

340
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,472
silence, loneliness,

341
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:03,958
this feeling which the maltreated heart finally starts again to rectify.  

342
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,232
Alma spoils me in a way completely moving.  

343
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:18,678
I think that it has fun and that it has friendship for me,

344
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:23,078
and even of the love, an unconscious and adorable way.  

345
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,510
I have fun to study it.  

346
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:37,353
It cries sometimes over old sins,

347
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:40,358
a episodical orgy with a strange boy

348
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:42,994
which ended in an abortion.  

349
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,919
It complains not to follow its principles.  

350
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:18,749
I see that you read a part.  

351
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:21,599
It is good sign, I will say it to the doctor.  

352
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,316
should Us return, not?  

353
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:29,238
I mist the city,a little.  

354
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,434
Step with you?  

355
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,234
do you Want to really please to me?

356  
00:46:50,840 --> 00:46:54,196
It is a sacrifice, but I need your assistance.  

357
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,715
That does not have anything dangerous:  I want that you speak to me 

358
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,237
Nothing special.  

359
00:47:01,560 --> 00:47:04,677
Of anything, our dinner of this evening,

360
00:47:05,080 --> 00:47:07,389
if water is cold after the storm,

361
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,795
too cold to swim there.  

362
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:13,192
let us speak only a few minutes. That one minute.  

363
00:47:13,400 --> 00:47:16,790
Lily a passage of your book. Just some words.  

364
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:23,351
I should not be annoyed. You remainders quiet, that looks at you.  

365
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:26,799
But I require that you speak to me.  

366
00:47:29,600 --> 00:47:31,192
Dear lady, cannot you say

367
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:32,873
only one word?  

368
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,710
I knew that you would refuse.  

369
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,596
You are unaware of what I feel.  

370
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,709
I thought that the artists felt

371
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,229
of the compassion for the others.  

372
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:52,677
That they created thanks to their humanity and their desire to be useful

373
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:54,752
I was really stupid!  

374
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,152
You were useful yourself of me.  

375
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:03,909
But you do not need more me, then you throw me.  

376
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:08,435
Yes, I hear!  I hear how much that sounds false.  

377
00:48:08,640 --> 00:48:12,349
You were useful yourself of me, and you throw me.  Each word!  

378
00:48:12,560 --> 00:48:13,879
And these glasses!  

379
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:24,398
You really wounded me.  

380
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,630
You made fun of me in my back.  

381
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:32,029
I read your letter for the doctor.  

382
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:33,798
It was not closed!  

383
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,070
And I read it thoroughly.  

384
00:48:38,040 --> 00:48:39,837
You made me speak

385
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:42,395
and statement of the intimate thing

386
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:47,116
And you tell it.  Which subject of study, hein?  You are not...  

387
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:49,352
Maintenant you will speak!  

388
00:48:49,560 --> 00:48:52,472
what you have to say, I advise you...  

389
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:06,799
Not, stops!  

390
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:20,311
You really were afraid, hein?  

391
00:49:22,520 --> 00:49:25,796
You were afraid, one moment, it is no

392
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,990
a real fear of dying, hein?  

393
00:49:29,880 --> 00:49:31,950
You said yourself:  "Alma is insane."  

394
00:49:32,520 --> 00:49:34,829
Which woman are you actually?  

395
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:39,150
Or you say you:  "I will not forget this face,

396
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,749
this intonation."  I will give you

397
00:49:42,040 --> 00:49:44,270
something which you will never forget.  

398
00:50:05,360 --> 00:50:07,237
That does make you laugh, hein?  

399
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,388
It is not so simple for me. 

400
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:13,438
Ni if amusing.  

401
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,875
You at least, you have your laughter.  

402
00:51:38,680 --> 00:51:40,830
does It have inevitably to be thus?  

403
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:47,274
Is it really significant not to lie, of saying the truth,

404
00:51:47,480 --> 00:51:49,835
to find the intonation right?  

405
00:51:50,680 --> 00:51:53,592
can one live without speaking freely?  

406
00:51:54,080 --> 00:51:57,834
To lie and deviate from the things and to avoid them.  

407
00:51:59,160 --> 00:52:01,515
is not this better to agree

408
00:52:01,720 --> 00:52:04,393
lazy, to be neglected and lying.  

409
00:52:06,200 --> 00:52:10,159
Peut-tre improves one while being authorized with being oneself.  

410
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:15,917
Not, you do not include/understand.

411
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,555
You do not include/understand what I say.  You are inaccessible.  

412
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:24,673
they say to you balanced, but your madness is the worst.  

413
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,919
You cheeks so well balance that everyone believes you.  

414
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:31,953
Except me which know how much you are rotted.  

415
00:52:38,760 --> 00:52:39,909
What do I make?  

416
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:43,118
Elisabet!  

417
00:52:43,480 --> 00:52:45,436
Elisabet, forgives me.  

418
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:49,110
I was idiot, I do not know what took to me.  

419
00:52:49,320 --> 00:52:53,836
I am here to help you. But there was this dreadful letter.  

420
00:52:54,040 --> 00:52:58,670
I was disappointed so much. You asked me to speak to you about me.  

421
00:52:59,880 --> 00:53:03,668
It was good. You looked me with compassion, I had drunk and...  

422
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:06,440
it was pleasant to speak about all that.  

423
00:53:07,160 --> 00:53:12,439
I was as flattered as a large actress condescends to listen to me.  

424
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:16,839
And I said myself that it would be well if that could be useful to you.  

425
00:53:17,240 --> 00:53:21,597
They are dreadful? It is right exhibitionnism.  

426
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:24,633
Elisabet, I ask you to forgive me.  

427
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:27,832
I love you so much, you count so much for me.  

428
00:53:28,040 --> 00:53:31,510
I do not want that we separate into enemy.  

429
00:53:53,880 --> 00:53:57,668
You do not want to forgive me. You are too proud!  

430
00:53:57,880 --> 00:54:00,997
You will not drop because that is useless for you.  

431
00:54:01,200 --> 00:54:02,758
I do not want!  

432
00:54:03,080 --> 00:54:04,877
I do not want!  

433
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:04,518
We do not speak... do not listen... do not include/understand...  

434
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:09,639
Elisabet?  

435
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:58,673
When you sleep, your face is flask.  

436
00:59:01,280 --> 00:59:03,840
Your mouth is inflated and ugly.  

437
00:59:06,800 --> 00:59:09,678
You have an unpleasant wrinkle on the face.  

438
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:20,033
You feel the sleep and the tears.  

439
00:59:23,720 --> 00:59:26,632
I can see your pulse beating in your throat.  

440
00:59:27,560 --> 00:59:30,757
there you have a scar which you make up the day.  

441
00:59:33,400 --> 00:59:34,992
Elisabet!  

442
00:59:36,320 --> 00:59:38,231
It still calls.  

443
00:59:39,800 --> 00:59:42,155
I will see what he wants us.  

444
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,998
Here, far, so far in our loneliness.  

445
01:00:08,160 --> 01:00:09,434
Elisabet?  

446
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:13,870
Elisabet?  Forgive me, if I frightened you.  

447
01:00:15,360 --> 01:00:17,271
I am not Elisabet.  

448
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:19,198
I do not claim anything.  

449
01:00:20,160 --> 01:00:22,071
I did not want to disturb you.  

450
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,231
I include/understand you, you know.  

451
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:27,193
the doctor explained me.   

452
01:00:28,560 --> 01:00:31,870
the most difficult  is to explain to small.  

453
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,593
I do my better.  

454
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,719
There is something of deep, difficult to seize.  

455
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:44,594
One loves somebody, or rather one says to love somebody, it is...  

456
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:48,636
That is included/understood, it is tangible like the words.  

457
01:00:50,240 --> 01:00:53,277
Mr. Vogler, I am not your wife.  

458
01:00:53,760 --> 01:00:57,753
And one is liked in return, one builds a community.  

459
01:00:58,480 --> 01:01:00,550
That generates safety.  

460
01:01:00,800 --> 01:01:03,314
Alors that becomes bearable.

461
01:01:06,240 --> 01:01:09,949
How to say all it to what I thought, without me to lose,

462
01:01:10,600 --> 01:01:12,272
without you to annoy?  

463
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:21,593
I love you.  

464
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:23,472
As much as front.  

465
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:33,113
Not, would not be also anxious, my darling.  

466
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,318
We are two.  

467
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:38,478
We have confidence, we know our thoughts.  

468
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:41,752
We like. It, isn't this is true?  

469
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,313
the most significant, it is the effort, not the success, not?  

470
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:52,795
We are tormented children, without defense, only.  

471
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:58,558
Dis to small that mom will return soon.  

472
01:01:59,600 --> 01:02:02,797
Mom is sick, but it misses its little boy.  

473
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:05,749
Thinks of buying a gift to him.  

474
01:02:06,240 --> 01:02:08,549
On behalf of its mom, does not forget.  

475
01:02:08,760 --> 01:02:10,876
I have such an amount of tenderness for you!  

476
01:02:14,880 --> 01:02:16,711
It is almost insupportable.  

477
01:02:18,320 --> 01:02:21,073
I can only make of all this tenderness.  

478
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:25,150
It is your tenderness which makes me live.  

479
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,678
Elisabet, are you well with me?  

480
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:32,152
is pleasant?  

481
01:02:34,600 --> 01:02:37,637
You are a marvellous lover, you know it.  

482
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:39,319
My darling...  

483
01:02:41,160 --> 01:02:44,596
Anaesthesia me...  Get rid of me!  

484
01:02:44,800 --> 01:02:47,598
I cannot any more! I do not support it any more!  

485
01:02:47,880 --> 01:02:51,509
Leaves me!  It is a shame! All is only shame.  

486
01:02:52,040 --> 01:02:56,591
Leaves me! I cold and am rotted and indifferent!  

487
01:02:57,160 --> 01:03:00,470
Whole that is only lies and imitation. All!  

488
01:03:07,120 --> 01:03:08,439
Elisabet...  

489
01:03:09,000 --> 01:03:10,399
which do you hold there?  

490
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:14,910
Which do you hide under your hand?  Let see me.  

491
01:03:18,560 --> 01:03:22,235
It is the photograph of your little boy whom you had torn.  

492
01:03:22,800 --> 01:03:24,756
We must speak about it.  

493
01:03:32,520 --> 01:03:34,590
Speaks to me about that, Elisabet.  

494
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:37,518
Alors I will do it.  

495
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:41,513
It with a festival is isn't one evening?  

496
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:44,356
It is late, there is noise.  

497
01:03:45,840 --> 01:03:48,957
About the morning, somebody in the group known as:  

498
01:03:49,560 --> 01:03:53,758
"Elisabet, you have all that a woman, an artist can wish,

499
01:03:56,315 --> 01:03:54,120
"but you miss maternity."  

500
01:03:58,120 --> 01:04:00,873
You laugh because that seems to you ridiculous

501
01:04:01,680 --> 01:04:05,434
But then, you remarks that you reconsider there.  

502
01:04:07,200 --> 01:04:09,191
That worries you more and more.  

503
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,469
You leashes your husband to make you a child.  

504
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,712
You want to be mother.  

505
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:19,357
That becomes irrevocable, then you take fear.  

506
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,633
Fear of this responsibility,fear of being connected,

507
01:04:22,840 --> 01:04:24,876
to have to leave the theatre.  

508
01:04:25,720 --> 01:04:28,280
Fear of the pain, fear of death,

509
01:04:28,480 --> 01:04:30,869
fear of your body which swells. 

510
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:34,116
But you cheeks your role.  

511
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,512
the role of a future mother,young person and happy.  

512
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:39,915
Everyone known as:  

513
01:04:40,200 --> 01:04:43,431
"It is superb. It was never also beautiful."  

514
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:50,069
Meanwhile, you try to remove you from the foetus.  

515
01:04:51,200 --> 01:04:52,758
But you fail.  

516
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:57,514
When that becomes irreversible,you start to hate the baby.  

517
01:04:58,320 --> 01:05:01,153
And to hope that he is still-born child.  

518
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,958
You hope for the death of your baby.  

519
01:05:09,080 --> 01:05:11,799
You hope to have a baby still-born child.  

520
01:05:16,320 --> 01:05:18,834
the childbirth is long and difficult.  

521
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:21,589
You suffer during days.  

522
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:24,915
Lastly, the baby left to the forceps.  

523
01:05:25,160 --> 01:05:29,199
Disgusted and terrorized by this vagissant baby, you murmurs:  

524
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:32,312
"can't you die quickly? Can't you die?"  

525
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,072
But it survives.  

526
01:05:37,840 --> 01:05:40,115
the baby cries day and night.  

527
01:05:43,360 --> 01:05:45,157
And you hate it.  

528
01:05:46,040 --> 01:05:49,510
You are afraid, you have bad conscience.  

529
01:05:51,560 --> 01:05:54,916
Lastly, a nurse takes the child in load.  

530
01:05:55,680 --> 01:05:59,389
You can leave your bed and turn over to the theatre.  

531
01:06:02,360 --> 01:06:04,635
But you did not finish suffering.  

532
01:06:05,960 --> 01:06:10,397
the child is caught of an immense and unsoundable love for his/her mother.  

533
01:06:11,040 --> 01:06:14,874
You defend yourself. You defend yourself with despair.  

534
01:06:15,640 --> 01:06:18,074
You feel that you cannot return to him.  

535
01:06:18,440 --> 01:06:20,795
And you test, you test...  

536
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,197
But your meetings remains awkward and cruel.  

537
01:06:25,560 --> 01:06:29,678
You do not arrive there. You are cold and indifferent.  

538
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:32,357
It looks at you.  

539
01:06:32,680 --> 01:06:35,433
It loves you and it is so nice!  

540
01:06:35,640 --> 01:06:38,518
It is always after you, you want to strike it.  

541
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:43,589
It is repugnant to you with his large mouth and its ugly body,

542
01:06:43,800 --> 01:06:45,870
its eyes wet and begging.  

543
01:06:46,400 --> 01:06:48,709
It is repugnant to you and frightens you.  

544
01:06:52,520 --> 01:06:56,195
Which do you hide under your hand? Let see me.  

545
01:07:00,840 --> 01:07:04,230
It is the photograph of your little boy whom you had torn.  

546
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,551
We must speak about it.  

547
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:17,355
Speaks to me about that, Elisabet.  

548
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:21,918
Alors I will do it.  

549
01:07:24,640 --> 01:07:27,200
It is isn't one evening, with a festival?  

550
01:07:28,080 --> 01:07:30,435
It is late, there is noise.  

551
01:07:32,160 --> 01:07:35,152
About the morning, somebody in the group known as

552
01:07:35,840 --> 01:07:40,197
"Elisabet, you have all that a woman, an artist can wish,

553
01:07:43,115 --> 01:07:40,840
"but you miss maternity."  

554
01:07:44,880 --> 01:07:47,553
You laugh because that seems to you ridiculous.  

555
01:07:49,000 --> 01:07:52,629
But then, you remarks that you reconsider there.  

556
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:55,230
That worries you more and more.  

557
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,475
You leashes your husband to make you a child.  

558
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,152
You want to be mother.  

559
01:08:04,960 --> 01:08:08,191
That becomes irreversible, then you take fear.  

560
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:12,670
Fear of this responsibility, fear of being connected,

561
01:08:12,880 --> 01:08:14,836
to have to leave the theatre.  

562
01:08:15,800 --> 01:08:18,155
Fear of the pain, fear of death,

563
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,790
fear of your body which swells.  

564
01:08:23,440 --> 01:08:25,556
But you cheeks your role.  

565
01:08:25,880 --> 01:08:28,917
the role of a future mother, young person and happy.  

566
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:32,516
Everyone known as: "It is superb.  

567
01:08:32,720 --> 01:08:34,597
"It was never also beautiful."  

568
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:39,516
Meanwhile, you try to remove you from the foetus.  

569
01:08:40,320 --> 01:08:41,878
But you fail.  

570
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:46,320
When you understand that it is irreversible,

571
01:08:47,680 --> 01:08:50,069
you start to hate the baby.  

572
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:54,633
And you hope that he will be still-born child.  

573
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,479
You hope for the death of your baby.  

574
01:09:04,680 --> 01:09:07,274
You hope to have a baby still-born child.  

575
01:09:11,320 --> 01:09:13,959
the childbirth is long and difficult.  

576
01:09:14,760 --> 01:09:16,876
You suffer during days.  

577
01:09:18,120 --> 01:09:20,236
Lastly, the child left to the forceps.  

578
01:09:21,320 --> 01:09:25,359
Disgusted and terrorized by your vagissant baby, you murmurs:  

579
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:28,950
"can't you die quickly?  Can't you die?"  

580
01:09:30,080 --> 01:09:32,196
the baby cries day and night.  

581
01:09:32,840 --> 01:09:34,353
And you hate it.  

582
01:09:35,440 --> 01:09:38,876
You are afraid, you have bad conscience.  

583
01:09:40,960 --> 01:09:44,509
Lastly, a nurse takes care of the child.  

584
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,556
You can leave your bed and take again the theatre.  

585
01:09:51,000 --> 01:09:52,797
But you did not finish suffering.  

586
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:59,716
the child is caught of an immense
and unsoundable love for his/her mother.  

587
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:05,315
You defend yourself hopelessly.
You feel that you cannot return to him.  

588
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:08,475
And you test, you test...  

589
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,990
But your meetings remains awkward and cruel.  

590
01:10:13,320 --> 01:10:15,470
You do not arrive there.  

591
01:10:15,720 --> 01:10:17,915
You are cold and indifferent.  

592
01:10:18,880 --> 01:10:20,632
It looks at you.  

593
01:10:21,160 --> 01:10:23,913
It loves you and it is so nice!  

594
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,192
It is always after you, you want to strike it.  

595
01:10:28,480 --> 01:10:32,109
It is repugnant to you with his large mouth and its ugly body,

596
01:10:32,320 --> 01:10:34,629
its eyes wet and begging.  

597
01:10:34,840 --> 01:10:37,195
It is repugnant to you and frightens you.  

598
01:10:45,200 --> 01:10:46,349
Not!  

599
01:10:48,080 --> 01:10:49,957
I am not like you.  

600
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,276
I do not have the same feelings.

601
01:10:53,160 --> 01:10:56,118
I am Alma, nurse. Arrival to help you.  

602
01:10:56,760 --> 01:11:00,639
I am not Elisabet Vogler.You are Elisabet Vogler.  

603
01:11:01,400 --> 01:11:03,038
I would like to have...  

604
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:06,392
I like...  

605
01:11:08,680 --> 01:11:10,113
I do not have...  

606
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,036
I learned much.  

607
01:11:59,160 --> 01:12:01,390
We will see how long I hold.  

608
01:12:07,360 --> 01:12:10,796
I will be never like you! I change perpetually.  

609
01:12:11,000 --> 01:12:13,992
Do what you want, you do not reach me any more.  

610
01:12:46,720 --> 01:12:48,756
Parler does not help.

611
01:12:49,360 --> 01:12:51,191
a light which tears.  

612
01:12:51,400 --> 01:12:53,197
a way of being different.  

613
01:12:53,520 --> 01:12:55,954
Step now, not.  Not, not.  

614
01:12:57,200 --> 01:12:59,589
One knows, one is out of time.  

615
01:12:59,920 --> 01:13:02,878
the unforeseen one. When that was to arrive,

616
01:13:03,080 --> 01:13:04,957
that did not arrive, therefore failure.  

617
01:13:05,240 --> 01:13:08,835
Yourself where you are. But I should do it.  

618
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:13,393
Step towards the interior, not.
To link and advise the others.  

619
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,875
the inconsolable ones, perhaps...  

620
01:13:20,840 --> 01:13:24,389
For example, yes... but which is closest...

621
01:13:25,080 --> 01:13:28,550
Comment is that called? Not, not, not...  

622
01:13:29,200 --> 01:13:31,714
Us, one, me, I...  

623
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:34,435
So much of words, such a nausea...  

624
01:13:34,640 --> 01:13:37,473
incomprehensible Pain. To throw...  

625
01:15:06,160 --> 01:15:08,720
Tries to listen to me now.

626
01:15:09,040 --> 01:15:10,917
Repeats after me.  

627
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:17,112
Nothing.  

628
01:15:20,440 --> 01:15:21,873
Nothing.  

629
01:15:23,160 --> 01:15:24,832
Not, nothing.  

630
01:15:31,600 --> 01:15:33,272
Nothing.  

631
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:35,998
It is that.  

632
01:15:36,360 --> 01:15:39,318
It is well. Thus it must be.

633
