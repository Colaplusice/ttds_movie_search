1
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:28,792
My mother died of pneumonia
when I was just a kid.

2
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,470
My father'd kept their wedding
cake frozen for 10 whole years.

3
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,231
After the funeral he gave it to the
yardman. He tried to act happy...

4
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,069
...but he couldn't be consoled by the
little stranger he found in his house.

5
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,195
Then one day, hoping to begin a new
life away from all his memories...

6
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,951
...he moved us from Texas
to Fort Dupree, South Dakota.

7
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:33,837
I'll give you a dollar
to eat this collie.

8
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,315
I ain't gonna eat him for a dollar.

9
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:47,679
I don't think he's a collie, either.
Some kind of dog, though.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,439
Watch your head.

11
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,191
Hey, Woody! Give me a cigarette!

12
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,076
Woody wouldn't give me a cigarette.

13
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:08,589
Ever notice he don't talk much?

14
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,598
Yeah, he's not a talker.
You got that.

15
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,999
Little did I realize that what began
in the alleys and back ways...

16
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:22,672
... of this quiet town would end
in the badlands of Montana.

17
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,116
-They won't fit.
-How do you know?

18
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,515
-What size are they?
-Your size.

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:29,438
-Give me a dollar.
-Nah.

20
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:31,835
They cost 20 new.

21
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,950
Why don't you see if they fit you?

22
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:53,039
This lady don't ever pay her bills.

23
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:57,034
She's gonna get in trouble
if she doesn't watch out.

24
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:10,639
I throwed enough trash for today,
Cato. I'll see you in the morning.

25
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,634
-Catch!
-What do you mean?

26
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:13,715
Hi. I'm Kit. I'm not keeping you
from anything important, am I?

27
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,148
No.

28
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,599
Just thought I'd come over and say
hello to you. I'll try anything once.

29
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:26,193
-What's your name? I said mine.
-Holly.

30
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:33,512
Well, Holly, you.... I don't know,
you want to take a walk with me?

31
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,310
-What for?
-Oh, I got some stuff to say.

32
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,556
Guess I'm kind of lucky that way.

33
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:45,151
Most people don't have anything
on their minds, do they?

34
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:50,674
Oh, incidentally,
my last name is Carruthers.

35
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,032
-Sounds too much like "druthers," huh?
-It's okay.

36
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,116
Yeah, well, nobody asked me what I
thought. They just hung it on me.

37
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,592
-You still in school?
-No, I got me a job.

38
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,392
Doing what?

39
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:13,549
Well, I don't mind getting up early
so I got a job throwing garbage.

40
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,079
Holly!

41
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,909
-I'm not in love with it.
-That's my father. I gotta run.

42
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,350
Wait! When will I see you again?

43
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:27,071
-I know what my daddy's gonna say.
-What?

44
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,754
-Can I be honest?
-Sure.

45
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:34,514
That I shouldn't be seen with
anybody that collects garbage.

46
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,439
-He'll say that?
-Yeah.

47
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:41,237
-Now, what's he know about garbage?
-Nothing.

48
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,993
There you go.

49
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:48,194
I mean, there's nothing
he wants to know. I gotta run.

50
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,992
-Who was that?
-Just some boy.

51
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:05,634
Is that gonna kill the grass?
You got some on my feet!

52
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,833
What'd he want?

53
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,198
He was just asking if we needed
any yard work done.

54
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,913
I said no.
And for him not to bother us.

55
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,911
Heard the news, Kit?

56
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,354
No.

57
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,675
Been in all the headlines.

58
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,233
What's that?

59
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,916
You've been fired.
Ain't that a helluva note?

60
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,228
Yeah, how about that?

61
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:45,315
I won't need my keys. I'll leave them
where they'll be nice and handy.

62
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,993
I've got my dog.

63
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,876
Have you ever held another job before?

64
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:59,789
Yeah, I used to throw trash
for the city.

65
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:04,915
-And you lost that one?
-Yeah, I wouldn't be here if I hadn't.

66
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:10,073
-Why did you leave?
-Just felt like it.

67
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,150
What kind of work you think you'd be
qualified for? I just gotta get this.

68
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,475
Well, I can't think of anything
at the moment.

69
00:07:26,760 --> 00:07:32,471
I want you to write me out a slip
though, proving I came down here.

70
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,357
I think we can get you something
working cattle over at the pens.

71
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,959
Yeah, what the hell.
Just hope there's a breeze.

72
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:59,950
He was handsomer than anybody I'd met.
He looked just like James Dean.

73
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:04,236
-Hi.
-Well, stop the world.

74
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:07,638
-Hey, quit my job.
-Great.

75
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,717
Seemed like the right move.

76
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:12,110
-What you doing?
-Spanish.

77
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:15,193
How do you say "quit my job"
in Spanish?

78
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:18,039
Something mi trabajo.

79
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:23,354
Well, I'm going to work
as a cowboy now. Thinking about it.

80
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,435
It's a routine, like anything.

81
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:31,078
-What do you think?
-I don't know.

82
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:37,068
Yeah, well, at least nobody can get on
me about wearing these boots anymore.

83
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:46,117
You want to go for a ride?

84
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,799
Well, I got homework.

85
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:53,949
Bring it along.

86
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:00,592
Somebody dropped a bag
on the sidewalk.

87
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:06,312
If everybody did that,
the whole town'd be a mess.

88
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,359
Hi.

89
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:16,556
-You're a redhead.
-I know.

90
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:20,435
-Anybody ever call you "Red"?
-Yeah, but I don't like it.

91
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,077
-Why not?
-I just don't.

92
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,114
-I got a headache.
-Oh, yeah?

93
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:42,470
-Can I come see you tomorrow?
-Okay.

94
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:57,028
Kit went to work in the feedlot
while I carried on with my studies.

95
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:59,196
Little by little, we fell in love.

96
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,198
As I'd never been popular in school...

97
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:06,030
...and didn't have much personality, I
was surprised he took a liking to me.

98
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,919
Especially when he could've had any
girl in town if he'd given it a try.

99
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:15,671
He said that I was grand though,
that he didn't want me for sex...

100
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,394
...and that, coming from him,
this was a compliment.

101
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,390
He'd never met a 15-year-old girl
who behaved more like a grownup.

102
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:25,431
He didn't care what people thought.

103
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,319
I looked good to him
and whatever I did was okay.

104
00:10:28,520 --> 00:10:32,911
If I didn't have a lot to say,
that was okay too.

105
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,036
What a nice place.

106
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,392
Yeah, the tree makes it nice.

107
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,313
And the flowers.

108
00:10:43,560 --> 00:10:49,112
Let's not pick them. They' re so nice.

109
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:51,716
It's your play.

110
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:58,358
Of course I had to keep this a secret
from my dad. He would've had a fit...

111
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,156
...since Kit was 10 years older and
from the wrong side of the tracks.

112
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,797
Our time with each other was limited.
Each lived for the precious hours...

113
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:11,913
... when they could be with each other,
away from the cares of the world.

114
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,999
My stomach's growling.

115
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:19,431
There's an old Fudgsicle,
you want it?

116
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,033
No.

117
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:25,990
-Somebody else is gonna get it.
-I don't care.

118
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:31,472
Kids eat that kind of stuff in Korea.

119
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:37,355
In the feedlot, he'd remember
how I'd looked the night before.

120
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:42,634
How I ran my hand through his hair
and traced his lips with my fingertip.

121
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:48,676
He wanted to die with me, and I dreamed
of being lost forever in his arms.

122
00:11:50,760 --> 00:11:55,550
The only thing I did wrong was
throwing out my fish when he got sick.

123
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:59,355
Later I got a new one,
but this incident kept bothering me.

124
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,991
Well, he was sick.
You couldn't do much about that.

125
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,998
-I guess not.
-So?

126
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:10,352
-Well, it scared me.
-I know....

127
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,472
I didn't mind telling Kit
about this stuff.

128
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,629
Strange things happened to him too.
And some of what he did was strange.

129
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,991
He faked his signature
whenever he used it...

130
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,273
... to keep other people from forging
important papers with his name.

131
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,194
And as he lay in bed
in the middle of the night...

132
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:36,598
...he heard a noise like somebody
was holding a seashell to his ear.

133
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,270
And sometimes he'd see me
in beautiful white robes...

134
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,870
...and I'd put my cold hand
on his forehead.

135
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,191
Did it go the way it's supposed to?

136
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,153
Yeah.

137
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:01,637
-Is that all there is to it?
-Yeah.

138
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,829
-What was everybody talking about?
-Don't ask me.

139
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:17,996
I'm glad it's over. For a while I was
afraid I might die before it happened.

140
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,999
Had a wreck or some deal like that.

141
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,555
See where that tree fell in the water?

142
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:29,000
Yeah. River must've washed
the roots away.

143
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:31,435
You don't care about
anything I say, though.

144
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,071
-You know what I think?
-What?

145
00:13:35,280 --> 00:13:39,910
Let's crunch our hands with this stone.
Then we won't forget today.

146
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:44,477
-But it would hurt.
-Well, that's the point, stupid.

147
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,469
Don't call me stupid.

148
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,195
Okay, but I'm gonna keep it
for a souvenir.

149
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:57,075
Well, maybe one that's lighter.

150
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:13,074
Kit vowed he'd always stand beside me
and let nothing come between us.

151
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:18,035
He wrote this out, put it in a box
with some of our tokens and things...

152
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:22,398
...and sent it off in a balloon
he'd found on the garbage route.

153
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:25,797
His heart was filled with longing
as he watched it drift off.

154
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,232
Something must've told him we'd never
live these days of happiness again...

155
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:32,590
... that they were gone forever.

156
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,154
Then, sure enough, Dad found out I'd
been running around behind his back.

157
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:48,271
He was madder than I'd ever seen him.

158
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,918
As punishment for deceiving him,
he went and shot my dog.

159
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:21,710
He made me take extra music
lessons after school...

160
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:24,190
...and wait till he picked me up.

161
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:30,509
He said if piano didn't keep me off
the streets, maybe the clarinet would.

162
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:39,948
Sure is pretty.

163
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,909
What'd you come out here for?

164
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:51,835
I wasn't aware there was
any law against it.

165
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:03,832
You know Holly?

166
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,116
Well, she means
an awful lot to me, sir.

167
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:15,479
Before I met her, nobody could
ask me how I was doing with my girl.

168
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:18,240
Matter of fact, I didn't have one.

169
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:20,152
Is that right?

170
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:32,269
It okay, me leaning on your Willys?

171
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:43,472
Look, I got a lot of respect
for her too, sir.

172
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,433
It's about as good a one
as I know to tell you.

173
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,159
Well, it's not good enough.

174
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:00,073
What'd happen to her if she
stuck around with a guy like you, Kit?

175
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:02,396
She'd get along okay.

176
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:06,991
And if she didn't, why,
she could just take off.

177
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:10,391
Just take right on off,
I wouldn't mind.

178
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:13,990
I'd always tell people I deserved it.

179
00:17:23,560 --> 00:17:28,395
I don't want you hanging around
anymore. I don't wanna see you again.

180
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,989
Understand?

181
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:45,238
You something.

182
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:52,473
Takes all kinds, sir.

183
00:19:24,800 --> 00:19:26,233
Hi.

184
00:19:27,040 --> 00:19:29,395
What are you doing?

185
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,990
I got a gun here, sir.
Always a good idea to have one around.

186
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,791
What do you think you're doing?

187
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:45,592
Go on, get out of here.

188
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,434
I got it all planned.

189
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,591
And I'm taking Holly off with me.

190
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:58,870
Okay, boy. I'm turning you over
to the authorities.

191
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:03,111
-What for?
-Coming on my property with a gun.

192
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:09,555
-No, you're not either.
-Yeah? Why not?

193
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:12,875
'Cause I can't allow it.

194
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,554
Hey!

195
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:18,750
Hey, wait a minute!

196
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,871
Suppose I shot you?

197
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,755
How'd that be? Huh?

198
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,198
Wanna hear how it sounds?

199
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,239
-Kit! Kit!
-Hey, where're you going?

200
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:53,238
Daddy?

201
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:57,119
This is Holly.

202
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:02,279
Are you gonna be okay?

203
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,997
I came in the front.

204
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,271
How bad off is he?

205
00:21:37,480 --> 00:21:39,550
I can look and see.

206
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,189
We better call the doctor.

207
00:21:45,680 --> 00:21:49,798
Listen, I'll say how it happened.
The part I saw.

208
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,029
Well, I don't think that'd work.

209
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:07,030
He don't need a doctor.

210
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,993
-Are you sure?
-Don't believe me, see for yourself.

211
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:08,715
I found a toaster.

212
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:20,995
Don't worry, honey, I'll--

213
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:52,268
Listen, maybe we ought to tell
somebody about this.

214
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:57,958
You said that once already.
Too late now.

215
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,159
Why?

216
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:06,313
They're not going to listen to me.
You either. You kidding?

217
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,713
Suppose the neighbors heard the noise?

218
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:17,156
Wouldn't be funny.

219
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:25,995
Listen, I'll be back after a while.

220
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:36,588
Oh, you wanna call the police, that's
fine. Just won't be so hot for me.

221
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:52,710
My girl, Holly, and I have decided to
kill ourselves. Same way I did her dad.

222
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:55,838
Big decision, huh?

223
00:25:57,440 --> 00:26:02,036
The reasons are obvious. I don't have
time to go into them right now.

224
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:08,998
But one thing though,
he was provoking me when I popped him.

225
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:11,435
That's what it was like. Pop.

226
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:14,713
Now we're sorry.

227
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:21,674
I mean, nobody's coming out of this
thing happy, especially not us.

228
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,870
I can't deny we've had fun though.
That's more than I can say for some.

229
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:38,310
That's the end of the message.
I ran out of things to say.

230
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:40,358
Thank you.

231
00:27:31,280 --> 00:27:34,272
--Holly and I have decided
to kill ourselves.

232
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:36,391
Same way I did her dad.

233
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:40,309
Kit left the record playing over
and over for the D.A. to find.

234
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:43,717
He was gambling for time.

235
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:04,750
Kit made me get my books from school
so I wouldn't fall behind.

236
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:08,715
We'd be starting fresh
and have to change our names.

237
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:11,514
His would be James, I'd be Priscilla.

238
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,194
We'd hide out somewhere up north...

239
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:17,472
... where people didn't ask
a lot of questions.

240
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:22,230
I could've snuck out the back
or hid in the boiler room.

241
00:29:22,440 --> 00:29:26,638
But I sensed that my destiny now lay
with Kit, for better or for worse.

242
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:30,469
It was better to spend a week
with one who loved me...

243
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,750
... than years of loneliness.

244
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,674
How you doing?

245
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:42,194
I'm fine. Kind of tired.

246
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:46,871
Yeah, me too.

247
00:29:56,880 --> 00:30:01,192
We hid out in the wilderness by a river,
in a grove of cottonwoods.

248
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:03,868
We built our house in the trees...

249
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:08,193
... with tamarisk walls and willows
laid down to make a floor.

250
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,791
There wasn't a plant in the forest
that didn't come in handy.

251
00:30:31,480 --> 00:30:34,438
We planned tunnels
under the forest floor.

252
00:30:34,680 --> 00:30:39,435
And our first task every morning
was to choose a new daily password.

253
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,996
Sometimes we'd steal
a chicken or a bunch of corn...

254
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,237
... or some melons from a melon patch.

255
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:50,149
Mostly, we just lay on our backs
and stared at the clouds.

256
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,999
Sometimes it was like being
in a big marble hall...

257
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,715
...how we talked in low voices
and heard the tiniest sound.

258
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:15,120
They'd found only one set of bones
so we knew they'd be looking for us.

259
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:18,113
Kit made sure we'd be prepared.

260
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:27,230
He taught me how a gun works.
How to take it apart and rebuild it...

261
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:29,795
...in case I had to carry on
without him.

262
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:33,953
He said that if the devil came at me,
I could shoot him with a gun.

263
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:42,595
One day I carried 30 pounds of wood
a distance of five miles.

264
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:48,949
Another day I covered my eyes with
makeup to see how they'd come out.

265
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:28,833
We had our bad moments
like any couple.

266
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:32,038
Kit accused me
of only being along for the ride...

267
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:37,872
... while at times I wished he'd fall in
the river and drown so I could watch.

268
00:32:38,280 --> 00:32:40,589
Take a break, Red.

269
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,637
Life of Riley, huh?

270
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,908
Mostly though, we got along
fine and stayed in love.

271
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:53,596
One of the chickens died last night.

272
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,511
I almost stepped on him.

273
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:15,111
"The Kon-Tiki's motion was a little
different from what it usually was.

274
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,118
We had become sensitive
to the log's rhythms.

275
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:24,031
I thought of suction from the coast and
was always on deck and up the mast. "

276
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:26,191
He was nervous.

277
00:33:26,400 --> 00:33:31,918
"Time passed. At dawn, just before 6,
Torstein came down from the masthead.

278
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:35,396
He saw a line of small
palm-clad islands ahead. "

279
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:57,720
I grew to love the forest. The cooing
of doves and the hum of dragonflies...

280
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:01,077
...made it lonesome
and like everybody's dead.

281
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,555
When the leaves rustled overhead...

282
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:09,954
...it was like the spirits whispered
about the things that bothered them.

283
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:24,118
One day while looking at some
vistas in Dad's stereopticon...

284
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:27,756
-...it hit me that I'm just a girl...
-Hi.

285
00:34:28,000 --> 00:34:32,915
... whose father was a sign painter,
who had just so many years to live.

286
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:36,237
Sent a chill down my spine
and I thought...

287
00:34:36,480 --> 00:34:41,998
... where would I be this very moment
if Kit had never met me?

288
00:34:42,560 --> 00:34:44,676
Or killed anybody?

289
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:47,789
This very moment.

290
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:51,278
If my mom had never met my dad.

291
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:55,068
If she had never died.

292
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:59,190
And what's the man
I'll marry gonna look like?

293
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:04,516
What's he doing right this minute?
Is he thinking about me now...

294
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:08,633
...by some coincidence,
even though he doesn't know me?

295
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,077
Does it show on his face?

296
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:17,799
For days afterwards, I lived in dread.
Sometimes I wished I'd fall asleep...

297
00:35:18,040 --> 00:35:23,990
...and be taken off to some magical
land, but this never happened.

298
00:36:40,360 --> 00:36:41,713
What?

299
00:36:46,920 --> 00:36:49,115
Get out of here! Run!

300
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,675
Somebody's coming!

301
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,919
Hide!

302
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:09,439
Hey!

303
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,518
Holly!

304
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:44,039
Get in the car, Red.

305
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:47,875
We don't need this.

306
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:54,990
Kit felt bad about shooting
those men in the back.

307
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:59,352
But he said they'd come in and
would've played it down and dirty.

308
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:04,754
Besides, he'd overheard them say they
were only interested in the reward.

309
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:07,520
With lawmen
it would have been different.

310
00:39:07,720 --> 00:39:12,748
They had a job to do and deserved
a chance. But not a bounty hunter.

311
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:51,553
We went to hide out with Kit's friend
from the days of the garbage route.

312
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,552
-How you doing, Cato?
-Not bad.

313
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,636
Take that son of a bitch.

314
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,752
What you been doing?

315
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:42,949
Running this place for a guy in town.
Nothing much to speak of.

316
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:48,234
Well, I don't notice us
hustling trash, either.

317
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:56,398
-Where'd you get them antlers?
-They come with the house.

318
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:03,829
Well, Cato,
I want you to meet my girl.

319
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,191
Holly Sargis.

320
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,793
Hi.

321
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,790
This guy at the nut house walked around
naked, except for hat and gloves.

322
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,549
And a nurse said,
"You can't walk around that way. "

323
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:22,719
And the guy says, "Well,
nobody comes around here anyway. "

324
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:27,118
The nurse says, "Well, why do
you have on the hat and gloves? "

325
00:41:27,360 --> 00:41:30,432
And the guy says,
"Well, you never know. "

326
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:40,310
Isn't that funny?

327
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:43,233
Yeah, I guess.

328
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:46,433
She plays clarinet too.

329
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:52,188
-Don't you get bored around here?
-Well, sometimes.

330
00:41:53,960 --> 00:41:59,876
The other day, an old boy plowing
the field there found some old coins.

331
00:42:01,280 --> 00:42:03,316
Some old Spanish coins.

332
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:09,274
-That's what he told you, huh?
-Nope, no, he showed me one.

333
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:14,231
-What'd they look like?
-Well, kind of round, like so. Gold.

334
00:42:14,480 --> 00:42:17,358
-Where at?
-Over in that field over there.

335
00:42:20,080 --> 00:42:22,548
I'll show you if you want.

336
00:42:22,960 --> 00:42:25,997
Let me finish my supper.

337
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:35,949
We're thinking of going to Texas.
Holly wants to visit some people.

338
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:40,910
But after that, I don't know.
They say Mexico's nice.

339
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:45,757
-Kit, maybe I better get a shovel.
-Okay.

340
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,673
-I'll catch up with you.
-Okay.

341
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,392
I found a lid.
It was laying on the ground.

342
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:56,034
Put that down. It's dirty.

343
00:43:07,760 --> 00:43:10,957
-You missed!
-You're a pissant.

344
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,230
Hey, you're throwing big ones!

345
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:21,633
Cato!

346
00:43:21,880 --> 00:43:23,677
The shovel's in the truck.

347
00:44:05,400 --> 00:44:10,872
Kit never let on why he shot Cato. He
said talking about it could be bad luck.

348
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:15,796
And that right now we needed
all the luck we could get.

349
00:44:17,360 --> 00:44:20,033
You never told me about her.

350
00:44:40,760 --> 00:44:43,718
Look at all this junk.

351
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:46,989
How's he doing?

352
00:44:50,280 --> 00:44:52,953
I got him in the stomach.

353
00:44:55,880 --> 00:44:57,438
Is he upset?

354
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:01,392
He didn't say anything to me about it.

355
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,955
Bunch of junk.

356
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:34,035
He stole that cage.
I saw him do it.

357
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,108
Why look at that? Can't afford it.

358
00:45:41,360 --> 00:45:43,396
I'm just looking.

359
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:47,953
Why don't you go in there and
keep him company for a while?

360
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:55,832
-Hi.
-Hi.

361
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,118
Is that your spider in there?
In that bottle?

362
00:46:01,320 --> 00:46:02,673
Yeah.

363
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:06,714
What do you feed him?

364
00:46:07,400 --> 00:46:12,428
Oh, flies.
Grasshoppers when I can catch them.

365
00:46:13,360 --> 00:46:15,396
Does he bite?

366
00:46:16,160 --> 00:46:18,037
He never bit me.

367
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:40,759
Hi.

368
00:46:42,000 --> 00:46:44,639
-Hi.
-Where's Cato?

369
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:47,510
-Well, he's gone.
-Gone?

370
00:46:47,720 --> 00:46:49,915
-Yeah.
-Where?

371
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:53,470
-He said not to tell.
-Oh, yeah?

372
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:58,119
He said for you to give us
a lift into town.

373
00:46:58,320 --> 00:47:01,232
You've got the Studebaker, right?

374
00:47:01,480 --> 00:47:05,712
-I need to pick up something in there.
-I can't allow that.

375
00:47:05,920 --> 00:47:08,957
-What?
-If you go in, I'll have to kill you.

376
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:11,674
-What's going on?
-Can't take any chances.

377
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,958
Come out of there, young lady.

378
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:22,755
Let's go out in this field. Come on.
Skip that. I'll keep my eye on you.

379
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,678
-Okay.
-You don't mind?

380
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:29,754
Hi.

381
00:47:31,720 --> 00:47:34,188
What's gonna happen to Jack and me?

382
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:38,313
Have to ask Kit. He says frog, I jump.

383
00:47:38,560 --> 00:47:39,834
Okay.

384
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:43,354
-What's your friend's name?
-Jack.

385
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:48,876
-You love him?
-I don't know.

386
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:53,595
I gotta stick by Kit.
He feels trapped.

387
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:58,436
-Yeah, I can imagine.
-Well, I've felt that way, haven't you?

388
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:07,078
Come on, you two,
down in the cellar.

389
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,274
Go on.

390
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,191
-Promise to stay there for an hour?
-Yeah.

391
00:48:18,600 --> 00:48:22,149
-You expect me to believe that?
-Yeah.

392
00:48:24,520 --> 00:48:26,556
I'm gonna shut the door.

393
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,550
-Think I got them?
-I don't know.

394
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,991
Well, I'm not going
down there and look.

395
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:03,918
Suddenly I was in shock. Kit was the
most trigger-happy person I'd met.

396
00:49:04,120 --> 00:49:10,150
He claimed if you play for keeps and
the law's coming, it's okay to kill.

397
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:15,599
You had to take the consequences
though, and not whine about it later.

398
00:49:20,480 --> 00:49:24,314
He'd never seemed violent before,
except for once...

399
00:49:24,520 --> 00:49:28,354
... when he said he'd like
to rub out a couple of guys.

400
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:34,994
It shows how you can know a person and
not really know him at the same time.

401
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:42,792
We're in for it now. If they catch us.

402
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,673
What'd you put him in there for?

403
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,916
Just to keep him out of the sun.

404
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,753
I didn't feel shame or fear,
but just kind of blah...

405
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:36,919
...like when you 're sitting there
and the water's run out of the bathtub.

406
00:50:37,160 --> 00:50:39,628
-You tired?
-Yeah.

407
00:50:39,880 --> 00:50:42,633
Yeah, you look tired.

408
00:50:45,120 --> 00:50:49,511
When this is over, I'll sit down
and buy you a big, thick steak.

409
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,149
I don't want a steak.

410
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:55,274
Yeah, well, we'll see about that.

411
00:50:55,840 --> 00:50:59,719
Hey, look. They're probably
gonna blame that on me too.

412
00:50:59,960 --> 00:51:01,757
Bastards.

413
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:08,313
The whole country was looking for us.
Who knew where Kit would strike next?

414
00:51:08,520 --> 00:51:12,832
Sidewalks cleared out.
Stores closed and drew their blinds.

415
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,272
Posses and vigilante groups formed
from Texas to South Dakota.

416
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:20,995
Children rode to school
under heavy guard.

417
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:26,194
A famous detective was brought in
from Boston. He could find no clues.

418
00:51:28,560 --> 00:51:31,757
People left their lights
on while they slept.

419
00:51:31,960 --> 00:51:36,795
My clarinet teacher said I wasn't
responsible, but others said I was.

420
00:51:37,000 --> 00:51:41,278
On Thursday, the governor of Oklahoma
sent the National Guard...

421
00:51:41,480 --> 00:51:47,316
... to guard the Federal Reserve Bank
in Tulsa because Kit meant to rob it.

422
00:51:47,560 --> 00:51:51,314
It was like the Russians had invaded.

423
00:52:05,160 --> 00:52:08,789
We needed supplies,
so we went to a rich man's house.

424
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:12,675
Kit felt it'd be safer
and quicker than shopping.

425
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:14,199
A maid came.

426
00:52:14,480 --> 00:52:18,439
Hi. I'm here to check your meter.
My tools are in here.

427
00:52:20,080 --> 00:52:22,913
This is Holly, she's from Texas.

428
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:27,958
Later we found out she was deaf,
and we hadn't even known it.

429
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:30,634
Excuse me.

430
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,110
-Hi.
-Yes?

431
00:52:34,320 --> 00:52:37,357
-This your place?
-Yes.

432
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:41,832
Sorry to barge in on you.
Anyone else here besides you two?

433
00:52:42,080 --> 00:52:43,399
No.

434
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,677
Good deal.

435
00:52:51,480 --> 00:52:55,917
Oh, we're on the run. And...

436
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,790
...we'd like to hang out here a while,
couple hours maybe, how'd that be?

437
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:04,110
Stay as long as you like.

438
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:27,958
Next time I ring, that means
it's time to clear out.

439
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:14,559
I left Kit in the parlor
and went for a stroll outside.

440
00:54:14,760 --> 00:54:18,275
The day was quiet and serene
but I didn't notice...

441
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:23,679
... for I was deep in thought and not
even thinking about how to slip off.

442
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:36,957
The world was like a faraway planet
to which I could not return.

443
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:43,554
I thought what a fine place it was,
full of things that people can enjoy.

444
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,068
Listen to your parents and teachers.

445
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:50,352
They understand things
and aren't the enemy.

446
00:54:50,560 --> 00:54:54,758
There's always an outside chance
you could learn something.

447
00:54:58,760 --> 00:55:03,959
Try to keep an open mind. Try to
understand the viewpoints of others.

448
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:07,112
Consider the minority opinion...

449
00:55:07,360 --> 00:55:12,559
...but try to get along with the
majority of opinion once it's accepted.

450
00:55:16,000 --> 00:55:20,312
Of course, Holly and I have had fun
even if it has been rushed.

451
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:28,675
So far, we're doing fine.
Hadn't got caught. Excuse the grammar.

452
00:55:36,320 --> 00:55:37,639
Hi.

453
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:41,910
Kit's downstairs playing
with the Dictaphone.

454
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,272
Sometimes he acts like there's
something wrong with his bean.

455
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:53,717
Hope nothing ever
goes wrong with mine.

456
00:55:53,920 --> 00:55:55,911
You think he's crazy, huh?

457
00:55:56,160 --> 00:55:59,948
I don't know, he's kind of odd.

458
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,956
They claim I've got him wrapped
around my finger.

459
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:13,476
But I never told him to shoot anybody.

460
00:56:16,040 --> 00:56:18,600
-Gosh, I like your house.
-Thank you.

461
00:56:38,680 --> 00:56:39,999
Hi.

462
00:56:40,680 --> 00:56:44,389
-Hi, Mr. Scarborough here?
-Yeah.

463
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:48,479
The thing about him,
he's down with the flu. He's sick.

464
00:56:48,680 --> 00:56:50,432
-Really?
-Yeah.

465
00:56:50,640 --> 00:56:54,918
I'd invite you in but it's contagious.
Don't want an epidemic.

466
00:56:55,120 --> 00:57:00,752
No, of course not. Only he called
last night and asked if I'd come by.

467
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,912
Well, he didn't have it last night.

468
00:57:11,000 --> 00:57:16,313
-What's that?
-I'd like to leave a message, okay?

469
00:57:16,520 --> 00:57:17,839
Sure.

470
00:57:24,400 --> 00:57:28,075
You have to excuse me now.
I have to go back inside.

471
00:57:28,680 --> 00:57:29,999
Bye.

472
00:57:43,480 --> 00:57:46,597
Hey, Tex, we're out of here!

473
00:57:59,960 --> 00:58:03,430
-Hi! What you doing?
-Just thinking.

474
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:06,877
Good a way to kill time as any.
She okay?

475
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,589
-Yes.
-Good.

476
00:58:10,800 --> 00:58:14,679
We're gonna take the Cadillac
for a while. How'd that be?

477
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:17,997
-Fine.
-Don't worry, I won't let her drive.

478
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:20,475
Oh, here.

479
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,240
A list of what I borrowed. Car too.

480
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:26,113
Okay, ma'am, let's go. Out that way.

481
00:58:26,760 --> 00:58:28,113
Go on.

482
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:31,959
You're my friend?

483
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:35,357
-Yes.
-Okay, no monkey business now.

484
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,713
Groceries.

485
00:58:47,560 --> 00:58:52,509
That guy could sell that list I gave
him as a sample of my handwriting.

486
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:05,116
-Why you always walking ahead of me?
-Why you always walking behind me?

487
00:59:05,360 --> 00:59:06,713
Don't!

488
00:59:06,920 --> 00:59:08,990
-Anybody ever do that to you?
-No.

489
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:11,919
-Positive?
-Yes.

490
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:18,517
Guess there's no way
I'll ever know for sure.

491
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:22,679
That guy must pay through the nose
to keep this place up.

492
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:27,715
Lawn. Gas and electric. Bagworms.

493
00:59:27,920 --> 00:59:30,480
Plus the upkeep on the cars.

494
00:59:30,720 --> 00:59:34,872
You get a little money and think
your problems are solved.

495
00:59:35,080 --> 00:59:38,197
Well, let me tell you, they're not.

496
00:59:59,720 --> 01:00:02,393
I'd like to get out of here.

497
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:05,598
Soon as I start the car.

498
01:00:06,840 --> 01:00:08,910
And fix my hat.

499
01:00:21,560 --> 01:00:26,918
Fearing roadblocks on the highways,
we took off across the Great Plains.

500
01:00:27,160 --> 01:00:31,039
Kit told me to enjoy the scenery
and I did.

501
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:35,472
" Rumor: Pat Boone's seriously
considering giving up his career...

502
01:00:35,680 --> 01:00:39,514
...so he can return to school
and complete his education.

503
01:00:39,720 --> 01:00:44,840
Fact: Pat told intimates that so long
as things go well for his career...

504
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,038
...it's the education that will
have to wait. "

505
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:49,559
I don't blame him.

506
01:00:49,760 --> 01:00:53,548
"Rumor: Frank Sinatra and
Rita Hayworth are in love.

507
01:00:53,800 --> 01:00:57,509
Fact: True. But not with each other. "

508
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:02,874
Yeah.

509
01:01:05,600 --> 01:01:09,798
Through desert and mesa,
across endless miles of open range...

510
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,116
... we made our headlong way...

511
01:01:12,320 --> 01:01:17,599
...steering by the telephone lines
toward the mountains of Montana.

512
01:01:19,640 --> 01:01:23,633
Kit'd sometimes ram a cow
to save ammo, and we'd cook it.

513
01:01:24,480 --> 01:01:29,998
Once we had to eat a bunch of salt
grass. It tasted like cabbage.

514
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:39,149
For gas we used the leakage from the
valves of pipelines along our way.

515
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:43,109
"Drip gas " is what it's called
in that part of the country.

516
01:01:43,320 --> 01:01:45,788
Gradually we approached the border.

517
01:01:46,000 --> 01:01:49,788
Kit was glad to leave South Dakota
and cursed its name.

518
01:01:50,000 --> 01:01:53,310
He said that if communists
drop the atomic bomb...

519
01:01:53,520 --> 01:01:57,229
...he wished they'd put it
in the middle of Rapid City.

520
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:01,878
That's Montana over there.

521
01:02:02,400 --> 01:02:04,960
I never been to Montana.

522
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:13,553
Acquaintance of mine's been there,
but I hadn't.

523
01:02:13,920 --> 01:02:16,957
Never had any reason to.

524
01:02:18,880 --> 01:02:21,599
State bird's the meadowlark.

525
01:02:57,000 --> 01:03:00,754
We lived in utter loneliness,
neither here nor there.

526
01:03:01,000 --> 01:03:06,233
Kit said that solitude was a better
word, more like what I wanted to say.

527
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:11,759
Whatever the expression, I told him
we couldn't go on living this way.

528
01:03:12,000 --> 01:03:17,313
Why not? I mean, I'm having fun.
At least I'm not bitchin'.

529
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:22,509
I feel like an animal living out here.
There's no place to bathe and...

530
01:03:22,760 --> 01:03:26,309
... not any place to get
anything good to eat.

531
01:03:27,840 --> 01:03:32,356
Well, I'll catch you a big trout
soon as we get to the mountains.

532
01:03:40,200 --> 01:03:42,634
Everybody loves trout.

533
01:03:43,040 --> 01:03:45,634
I'm serious.

534
01:03:56,920 --> 01:04:01,391
In the distance, I saw a train
making its way across the plain...

535
01:04:01,600 --> 01:04:04,910
...like the caravan in
The Adventures of Marco Polo.

536
01:04:05,120 --> 01:04:08,510
It was our first taste
of civilization in weeks...

537
01:04:08,720 --> 01:04:12,952
...and I asked Kit if we could
have a closer look.

538
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:23,396
Before we left, he shot a football
he considered excess baggage.

539
01:04:23,560 --> 01:04:26,028
Then he buried some of our things.

540
01:04:26,360 --> 01:04:30,911
He said nobody else would know where
we'd put them, that we'd come back...

541
01:04:31,160 --> 01:04:35,517
...and they'd still be here,
just the same, but we'd be different.

542
01:04:35,720 --> 01:04:40,077
And if we never got back, somebody
might dig them up years later...

543
01:04:40,320 --> 01:04:41,639
...and they'd wonder.

544
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:22,551
We should have hopped it.

545
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:25,875
It was going too fast.

546
01:05:26,040 --> 01:05:29,794
I could have pulled the car
on the tracks to slow it down.

547
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:31,439
Then we'd be stuck here.

548
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,836
Maybe we ought to be stuck here.
I'm not saying I know.

549
01:05:39,880 --> 01:05:41,108
You're crazy.

550
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:57,837
Kit spun the bottle, leaving to fate
which direction we should take.

551
01:06:02,120 --> 01:06:05,715
The slope throws it off,
we ought to find a flat place.

552
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:07,836
How about over here?

553
01:06:12,040 --> 01:06:13,439
It doesn't matter.

554
01:06:13,640 --> 01:06:17,633
If I'm worth a damn,
I'll pick the right direction.

555
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,438
-See what I mean?
-No.

556
01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:22,831
Well, I shouldn't expect
miracles, should I?

557
01:06:32,760 --> 01:06:35,228
We'll keep heading
for that mountain.

558
01:06:35,480 --> 01:06:38,631
Just remember, I said
it wasn't such a hot idea.

559
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:45,272
We took off at sunset, toward
the mountains of Saskatchewan...

560
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:49,274
...for Kit, a magical land
beyond the reach of the law.

561
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:53,274
He needed me more than ever,
but something came between us.

562
01:06:53,560 --> 01:06:55,676
I stopped paying attention to him.

563
01:06:56,080 --> 01:07:00,039
I sat in the car and read a map
and spelled out sentences...

564
01:07:00,200 --> 01:07:04,830
... with my tongue on the roof of my
mouth where nobody could read them.

565
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,230
We moved closer to the border.

566
01:07:10,400 --> 01:07:13,790
Across the prairie,
at the edge of the horizon...

567
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,958
... we saw gas fires
at the Missoula refineries.

568
01:07:17,320 --> 01:07:20,118
To the south, we saw the
lights of Cheyenne...

569
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:23,677
...a city bigger and grander
than I'd ever seen.

570
01:07:25,840 --> 01:07:28,798
I felt many things
looking at the lights.

571
01:07:29,000 --> 01:07:32,436
Most important, I made up my mind
to never tag around...

572
01:07:32,680 --> 01:07:36,434
... with the hell-bent type,
even if I loved him.

573
01:07:36,640 --> 01:07:39,074
I found the strength
to tell Kit this.

574
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:44,030
I pointed out that if we got to the
North, he still couldn't make a living.

575
01:07:46,320 --> 01:07:50,074
I can get a job with the Mounties.
Northwest Mounties.

576
01:07:52,040 --> 01:07:54,952
I got all the qualifications.

577
01:07:55,320 --> 01:07:59,233
I can ride and shoot...

578
01:07:59,520 --> 01:08:02,796
...and I don't mind the cold.

579
01:08:03,920 --> 01:08:05,273
I like the cold.

580
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:07,559
What?

581
01:08:08,600 --> 01:08:09,919
Nothing.

582
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:14,878
I was just running off
at the mouth as usual.

583
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:17,636
I'm sorry, I wasn't listening.

584
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:22,353
Hey, man, don't lip it.

585
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:23,839
Well...

586
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:29,749
...they'd ask to see your driver's
license before they'd hire you.

587
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,958
I'm not going to let
that stop me.

588
01:08:34,040 --> 01:08:37,715
-You smoke Pall Mall?
-Yeah.

589
01:08:39,480 --> 01:08:44,600
You haven't seen me when
I'm going after something. Tough.

590
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,869
Hey, don't touch that!
Nat King Cole!

591
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:24,717
If I could sing like that...

592
01:09:25,080 --> 01:09:29,119
...if I could sing a song
about the way I feel right now....

593
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,436
It would be a hit.

594
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:14,431
Kit knew the end was coming.

595
01:10:14,600 --> 01:10:17,239
He wondered if they'd
pronounce him dead...

596
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:22,031
...or if he'd read what the papers
would say from the other side.

597
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:27,513
He dreaded being shot down alone
without a girl to scream his name.

598
01:10:28,280 --> 01:10:33,673
Then, for an instant, the sight of the
mountains at dawn got his hopes up.

599
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:36,308
God, what a sight.

600
01:10:37,080 --> 01:10:39,036
Tell me this.

601
01:10:39,200 --> 01:10:43,876
What's a little Texas girl
like you think of that sight?

602
01:11:05,040 --> 01:11:07,554
Love this air.

603
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:13,717
Morning.

604
01:11:14,520 --> 01:11:16,795
You got any gas?

605
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:19,069
Maybe.

606
01:11:19,480 --> 01:11:22,517
I'm sorry, but we got
to ask you for it.

607
01:11:22,680 --> 01:11:25,353
We're about out,
been driving all night.

608
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:28,160
I don't got time to explain.

609
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:32,950
-What I got I can't spare.
-Just a second now.

610
01:11:33,120 --> 01:11:36,157
That's your truck, isn't it?
You didn't walk here.

611
01:11:36,320 --> 01:11:38,117
It's mine, all right.

612
01:11:38,840 --> 01:11:42,150
Well, listen, I'm gonna
swap you my Cadillac.

613
01:11:42,320 --> 01:11:46,233
Don't worry, you're getting
a fair deal. Hell, ask anybody.

614
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:49,830
What's the Blue Book value
on this thing, Mildred?

615
01:11:52,200 --> 01:11:53,952
Who are you?

616
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:57,358
Carruthers. I shoot people
every now and then.

617
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,310
-Not that I deserve a medal.
-Kit.

618
01:12:08,720 --> 01:12:11,439
Okay, friend, start running.

619
01:12:11,640 --> 01:12:13,915
-Give me a chance!
-Go on! Get!

620
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:21,909
I had a feeling today was the day.

621
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,558
-Helicopter.
-Yeah.

622
01:12:24,720 --> 01:12:26,631
He's not taking us on a ride.

623
01:12:26,840 --> 01:12:30,196
-Let's make a run for the car.
-I don't want to.

624
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:33,511
Have you got a better idea?

625
01:12:36,440 --> 01:12:38,032
I just don't wanna go.

626
01:12:40,920 --> 01:12:42,194
What?

627
01:12:56,080 --> 01:12:59,197
What is wrong with you?

628
01:13:07,360 --> 01:13:09,396
What is the matter with you?

629
01:13:17,320 --> 01:13:20,278
I don't know what to make
of people like you.

630
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,755
I really don't.

631
01:13:29,760 --> 01:13:31,239
You want a second chance?

632
01:13:31,720 --> 01:13:35,235
Noon, Grand Coulee Dam,
New Year's Day, 1964. Meet me.

633
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,032
Got that?

634
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:44,316
Hey! Anybody here?

635
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,119
Hi.

636
01:14:48,440 --> 01:14:51,432
You got any shells for a Savage,
.300 Savage?

637
01:14:52,400 --> 01:14:56,632
-Nope.
-I pissed mine away shooting bottles.

638
01:14:56,880 --> 01:14:59,030
You wanna fill her up? Please.

639
01:15:33,120 --> 01:15:35,076
You want any of that junk,
it's yours.

640
01:17:39,440 --> 01:17:43,115
What was going through his head
before they got him?

641
01:17:43,360 --> 01:17:46,432
Why didn't he run while
he had the chance?

642
01:17:46,600 --> 01:17:49,273
Did he figure they'd
catch him the next day?

643
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,317
Was it despair?

644
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:55,030
Said he had a flat tire,
but the way he carried on...

645
01:17:55,200 --> 01:17:56,474
...I imagine this is false.

646
01:18:51,880 --> 01:18:53,233
Hi.

647
01:18:53,520 --> 01:18:54,919
Hold it right there.

648
01:18:55,480 --> 01:18:58,438
I could've held off an army
in the mountains.

649
01:18:58,720 --> 01:19:02,235
-Oh, yeah?
-Long as my ammo held out.

650
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,635
About there's where you caught me.

651
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:07,637
We did it, Ray.

652
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:17,436
-Better not leave the car here.
-Put your hands back of your head.

653
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,429
Now put the other one on yourself.

654
01:19:31,120 --> 01:19:35,238
Hell, he ain't no bigger than I am.
Look at that.

655
01:19:37,480 --> 01:19:40,438
You're gonna give me
a cauliflowered ear.

656
01:19:41,240 --> 01:19:45,119
He should have thought about that
before he got caught.

657
01:19:45,280 --> 01:19:46,952
Shouldn't he?

658
01:20:03,080 --> 01:20:05,150
Think I'll take the juice?

659
01:20:06,680 --> 01:20:07,999
Beats me.

660
01:20:12,240 --> 01:20:15,232
What kind of rifle were
you shooting at me?

661
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,634
Thirty-aught-six.

662
01:20:17,000 --> 01:20:20,231
-You ever opened up like that before?
-Nope.

663
01:20:24,640 --> 01:20:27,950
You boys performed like
a couple of heroes.

664
01:20:28,120 --> 01:20:31,430
Don't think I'm not gonna
pass it around in town.

665
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:45,030
You tossed my hat out the window.

666
01:20:45,200 --> 01:20:46,519
Wanna sue me?

667
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:49,836
-No.
-Kit.

668
01:20:50,520 --> 01:20:52,636
Kit, I got a question for you.

669
01:20:54,520 --> 01:20:57,398
-You like people?
-They're okay.

670
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,636
Then why'd you do it?

671
01:21:03,400 --> 01:21:04,913
I don't know.

672
01:21:05,080 --> 01:21:08,629
I wanted to be a criminal.
Just not this big of one.

673
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,238
Takes all kinds, though.

674
01:21:18,000 --> 01:21:20,275
You know who he looks like?

675
01:21:21,440 --> 01:21:23,874
-You know, don't you?
-No.

676
01:21:24,720 --> 01:21:28,235
I'll kiss your ass if you don't
look like James Dean.

677
01:21:40,120 --> 01:21:41,269
How you doing?

678
01:21:41,600 --> 01:21:44,956
Fine as can be expected.
Just locked up, can't move.

679
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:49,033
-Nice coat you got on.
-You think? It's leather.

680
01:21:49,280 --> 01:21:53,034
Hey, now look here,
here's a real prize.

681
01:21:53,240 --> 01:21:56,198
I had this 10 years.
Who's gonna get it?

682
01:21:56,360 --> 01:21:57,873
-Give me that.
-There.

683
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,393
Where you from?

684
01:21:59,560 --> 01:22:03,235
-South Dakota, where you from?
-Here.

685
01:22:03,400 --> 01:22:04,719
Wanna comb?

686
01:22:05,480 --> 01:22:09,109
-Joni James is from South Dakota.
-She got out too.

687
01:22:09,280 --> 01:22:12,670
-Who's your favorite singer?
-Eddie Fisher. Yours?

688
01:22:12,840 --> 01:22:15,308
-Eddie Fisher.
-Damn! You want a pen?

689
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,755
-Been to Kansas?
-How old are you?

690
01:22:17,920 --> 01:22:19,797
Don't you read the papers?

691
01:22:19,960 --> 01:22:21,757
-Been married?
-No, I haven't.

692
01:22:22,760 --> 01:22:26,548
Hey, Kit. You afraid of death?

693
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:29,434
I haven't thought about it much.

694
01:22:30,280 --> 01:22:31,508
Say again?

695
01:22:31,680 --> 01:22:34,319
-Did you when you were on the move?
-Yep.

696
01:22:36,760 --> 01:22:39,274
I won't tell you how
to run your show...

697
01:22:39,440 --> 01:22:42,512
...but these cuffs are pinching.
What do you say?

698
01:22:42,680 --> 01:22:44,830
I need to get your signature.

699
01:22:45,000 --> 01:22:48,515
I'll have to read them first.
Could I get a Coke?

700
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,079
Sure thing.

701
01:22:50,400 --> 01:22:52,152
Come on.

702
01:22:52,480 --> 01:22:55,233
-Keep out of trouble.
-Don't worry about us.

703
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,153
Holly's over here
if you want to see her.

704
01:22:58,320 --> 01:23:00,311
Sure.

705
01:23:05,360 --> 01:23:08,591
I gave him the papers.
I don't want him in trouble....

706
01:23:08,760 --> 01:23:11,558
You wanna give me
a little slack here?

707
01:23:16,440 --> 01:23:18,351
Hi.

708
01:23:25,120 --> 01:23:27,873
Don't worry.
I'll get you off the charges.

709
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:33,558
There are other boys out there waiting
for you. You're gonna have fun.

710
01:23:38,440 --> 01:23:41,352
Boy, we rang the bell, didn't we?

711
01:23:43,280 --> 01:23:45,714
I'll say this though.

712
01:23:46,000 --> 01:23:51,632
That guy with the deaf maid,
he's just lucky he's not dead too.

713
01:23:57,480 --> 01:24:01,519
Of course, too bad about your dad.

714
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:03,796
Yeah.

715
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:07,510
We're gonna have to talk
about that sometime.

716
01:24:59,120 --> 01:25:00,997
There you go, Tom.

717
01:25:01,160 --> 01:25:05,199
-Thank you.
-Thank you very much, Chief Sims.

718
01:25:05,360 --> 01:25:08,158
-Sorry.
-You didn't cause me any trouble.

719
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:10,675
Thanks anyway.

720
01:25:10,840 --> 01:25:12,751
Well....

721
01:25:13,880 --> 01:25:15,029
-Kit.
-Tom.

722
01:25:15,200 --> 01:25:16,315
-Good luck.
-Thanks.

723
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:18,710
-I mean it.
-I know you do. You too.

724
01:25:19,120 --> 01:25:22,669
-Now we go.
-Okay. Thank you.

725
01:25:23,080 --> 01:25:24,513
Come on, Red.

726
01:25:41,840 --> 01:25:44,229
They took us back to South Dakota.

727
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:48,712
They kept him in solitary so he
didn't get to know other inmates.

728
01:25:49,080 --> 01:25:52,436
He knew they'd like him,
especially the murderers.

729
01:25:52,600 --> 01:25:56,559
Myself, I got off with probation
and a lot of nasty looks.

730
01:25:56,720 --> 01:26:00,759
Later, I married the son of the lawyer
who defended me.

731
01:26:02,280 --> 01:26:05,636
Kit slept in court
while his confession was read.

732
01:26:05,800 --> 01:26:08,314
He was sentenced to die
in the electric chair.

733
01:26:08,480 --> 01:26:11,358
On a warm spring night,
six months later...

734
01:26:11,600 --> 01:26:15,832
...after donating his body to science,
he did.

735
01:26:19,040 --> 01:26:24,478
-Sir? Where'd you get that hat?
-State.

736
01:26:25,240 --> 01:26:28,073
Boy, I'd like to buy me one of them.

737
01:26:28,720 --> 01:26:31,553
You' re quite an individual, Kit.

738
01:26:35,840 --> 01:26:39,037
Think they'll take that
into consideration?

739
01:29:50,400 --> 01:29:51,389
