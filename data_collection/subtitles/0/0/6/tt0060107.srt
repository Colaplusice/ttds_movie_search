The Passion According to Andrei
Part One

21
00:02:41,257 --> 00:02:43,282
- Pull the rope.
- This one?

22
00:02:49,365 --> 00:02:52,732
- Arkhip, give me the strap.
- Hold it.

23
00:02:56,706 --> 00:02:57,832
Take it.

24
00:02:59,942 --> 00:03:00,931
Look!

25
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:03,071
It's Yefim, isn't it?

26
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,331
- Come here and help.
- Pull the rope.

27
00:03:27,403 --> 00:03:29,803
- Hold on a second.
- Come on, quick!

28
00:03:31,808 --> 00:03:33,639
Where is it?

29
00:03:33,710 --> 00:03:36,508
- Where is it?
- Here.

30
00:03:40,216 --> 00:03:41,410
Come on, fast.

31
00:03:44,554 --> 00:03:47,182
Lift it.

32
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:09,337
Lord. Let it go right.

33
00:04:14,517 --> 00:04:16,508
Untie it now.

34
00:04:16,652 --> 00:04:18,279
The rope is tangled.

35
00:04:18,354 --> 00:04:21,016
Hold it!

36
00:04:21,124 --> 00:04:22,853
We won't have enough time.

37
00:04:26,829 --> 00:04:28,023
I'm ready!

38
00:04:28,131 --> 00:04:30,190
Archipushka! You try to hold them!

39
00:04:30,266 --> 00:04:32,757
Just a second.

40
00:04:34,804 --> 00:04:36,829
Come on!

41
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:38,806
Hold him, hold him!

42
00:04:51,287 --> 00:04:54,154
I'm here. I'm here.

43
00:05:00,196 --> 00:05:01,561
Cut the rope, man!

44
00:05:01,631 --> 00:05:05,590
Cut the rope!

45
00:05:05,668 --> 00:05:08,762
I'll show you, cut the rope!

46
00:05:27,790 --> 00:05:31,248
My God!

47
00:05:32,028 --> 00:05:34,394
Yefim!

48
00:05:34,464 --> 00:05:38,059
- Where are you going?
- Archipushka!

49
00:05:38,434 --> 00:05:43,235
I'm flying! I'm flying!

50
00:06:08,064 --> 00:06:13,502
Hey! Chase me! Chase me!

51
00:06:48,671 --> 00:06:50,502
My God! What is it?

52
00:07:12,061 --> 00:07:15,189
Archipushka!

53
00:08:14,824 --> 00:08:20,888
THE JESTER
Summer 1 400

54
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:36,407
Danil!

55
00:08:39,548 --> 00:08:40,913
Danil!

56
00:08:42,918 --> 00:08:45,443
Danil! The Father
told you to go back!

57
00:08:47,123 --> 00:08:49,683
There is no one to paint the icons.

58
00:08:49,992 --> 00:08:51,186
For God's sake!

59
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:53,592
It's no business of yours.

60
00:08:53,663 --> 00:08:57,064
You will be sorry for that. You
will come begging on your knees.

61
00:08:57,133 --> 00:08:58,600
But the Father will not forgive you.

62
00:08:58,668 --> 00:09:01,159
Come on. You never know.

63
00:09:01,237 --> 00:09:03,637
We shall see.

64
00:09:08,678 --> 00:09:10,669
It's not good.

65
00:09:10,746 --> 00:09:11,770
What?

66
00:09:12,181 --> 00:09:14,445
That we are leaving Troitsa.

67
00:09:23,726 --> 00:09:25,785
It's a shame.

68
00:09:27,797 --> 00:09:31,927
Aren't there enough painters
in Moscow without us, Danil?

69
00:09:32,835 --> 00:09:35,497
We'll find some sort of work.

70
00:09:35,571 --> 00:09:38,472
All this is right, but it's a pity that...

71
00:09:39,408 --> 00:09:42,969
I passed this birch every
day and never noticed it.

72
00:09:43,112 --> 00:09:47,310
When you know you'll never
see it again, it means something.

73
00:09:47,883 --> 00:09:52,217
It's been ten years. Nine
for you, but ten for me.

74
00:09:52,455 --> 00:09:54,514
No, seven for me, nine for you.

75
00:09:55,925 --> 00:09:58,291
- It's raining.
- Come on here.

76
00:09:58,394 --> 00:10:00,362
Let's go. We will not melt.

77
00:10:38,067 --> 00:10:41,559
The jesters were walking.
Drunk on mead and beer...

78
00:10:41,771 --> 00:10:45,969
...when they met their
master, the Boyar...

79
00:10:46,142 --> 00:10:48,303
...and they sang, to greet him:

80
00:10:48,644 --> 00:10:52,136
O master. O Boyar...

81
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:56,048
...everything is ready in the kitchen!

82
00:10:56,318 --> 00:11:01,881
The Boyar's plump
wife is a choosy trollop.

83
00:11:03,459 --> 00:11:07,418
Mistress, open the door.
The master's coming!

84
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:12,693
The Boyar yells: "Jesters are
all thieves and drunkards!

85
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:17,035
"You should be whipped
from Friday to Friday!"

86
00:11:17,273 --> 00:11:21,232
"You goats and tramps,
drown in your beer!

87
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,340
"Soon you will be impaled!"

88
00:11:24,713 --> 00:11:28,911
The Jesters grabbed him
between his navel and his knees.

89
00:11:32,488 --> 00:11:37,084
They shaved his beard; what's
a Boyar without his beard?

90
00:11:37,359 --> 00:11:41,420
Any woman would
rather he had a beard.

91
00:11:41,630 --> 00:11:46,192
The Boyar yells,
hops about like a flea.

92
00:11:46,569 --> 00:11:50,505
He scurries home,
raps on the window.

93
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:58,738
But his wife doesn't
recognize his naked cheeks...

94
00:12:00,482 --> 00:12:03,883
...with no beard to grab hold of.

95
00:12:04,153 --> 00:12:07,520
She whacked him with a rolling pin.

96
00:12:08,924 --> 00:12:10,721
What a disgrace!

97
00:12:12,761 --> 00:12:16,253
"Cover your naked cheeks
with your breeches.

98
00:12:16,799 --> 00:12:19,529
"Clear off, beardless Boyar!"

99
00:12:21,403 --> 00:12:25,430
He hobbled off, pursued by geese...

100
00:12:25,641 --> 00:12:28,371
...and met a priest...

101
00:12:28,711 --> 00:12:34,274
...who mistook him for a woman and
dragged him into the bushes.

102
00:12:36,819 --> 00:12:39,845
Without breeches...

103
00:12:40,189 --> 00:12:44,250
...he looks the same at each end.

104
00:13:13,389 --> 00:13:16,483
The woman saw a naked head...

105
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:20,359
...and grabbed it by the beard.

106
00:13:31,941 --> 00:13:35,707
May we shelter from the storm?

107
00:13:36,445 --> 00:13:38,174
Come in.

108
00:13:44,453 --> 00:13:47,684
Do you want some beer?
You are soaking wet.

109
00:13:47,756 --> 00:13:49,383
Thank you, we don't imbibe.

110
00:13:49,725 --> 00:13:51,215
And don't play around with women.

111
00:15:49,445 --> 00:15:52,414
God sent priests, but
the devil sent jesters.

112
00:16:33,455 --> 00:16:35,047
The woman saw a head!

113
00:16:37,126 --> 00:16:38,650
By the beard!

114
00:16:55,043 --> 00:16:58,843
My woman might have
been playing in the bushes.

115
00:17:04,987 --> 00:17:06,454
I'll show you!

116
00:18:22,531 --> 00:18:24,863
Come here, you.

117
00:18:54,696 --> 00:18:55,924
What are you doing?

118
00:19:30,966 --> 00:19:32,263
Give it back to him.

119
00:19:50,886 --> 00:19:52,581
Where were you, Kirill?

120
00:19:52,821 --> 00:19:55,415
Outside. Shall we go?

121
00:20:04,499 --> 00:20:10,062
Danil, the rain's stopped; let's go.

122
00:20:39,701 --> 00:20:41,532
Christ be with you, mistress.

123
00:21:38,994 --> 00:21:45,832
THEOPH ANES THE GREEK
Summer-Winter-Spring-Summer
1 405-1 406

124
00:21:55,243 --> 00:21:58,144
I'm innocent!

125
00:22:07,689 --> 00:22:08,713
Let me go!

126
00:22:43,391 --> 00:22:45,382
Is anyone in here?

127
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,059
Have you come to look?

128
00:23:25,734 --> 00:23:26,723
Yes, to look.

129
00:23:34,042 --> 00:23:37,637
Then look. We'll soon be finished.

130
00:23:40,315 --> 00:23:43,716
So you are Theophanes the Greek?

131
00:23:47,689 --> 00:23:50,658
Why look at me? Look there.

132
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:54,023
Where are you from?

133
00:23:54,396 --> 00:23:56,660
From Andronnikov Monastery.

134
00:23:57,165 --> 00:24:00,293
From Andronnikov Monastery?
Are you by chance Andrei Rublev?

135
00:24:03,371 --> 00:24:04,463
No.

136
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:08,976
I've heard everyone
praise this Rublev.

137
00:24:11,279 --> 00:24:15,340
He's good, but not as good as this.

138
00:24:19,521 --> 00:24:21,751
Such delicate colors.

139
00:24:26,361 --> 00:24:28,192
Oh Lord, it's just...

140
00:24:38,006 --> 00:24:41,908
Why did you stop
praising me? Go on.

141
00:24:41,977 --> 00:24:45,413
I can't. I can't find the right words.

142
00:24:45,614 --> 00:24:49,744
Konstantin Kostechevsky
was right when he said:

143
00:24:50,018 --> 00:24:52,543
"Only with true insight...

144
00:24:52,621 --> 00:24:55,089
"...can you grasp its essence."

145
00:24:57,359 --> 00:25:01,955
Whereas Andrei... and
I'll tell him to his face...

146
00:25:03,632 --> 00:25:06,533
He's like my brother.

147
00:25:07,002 --> 00:25:13,407
He's praised, it's true:
he paints well. With subtlety.

148
00:25:15,810 --> 00:25:19,644
But there's something
lacking in all his work.

149
00:25:23,952 --> 00:25:27,251
There's no awe, no faith...

150
00:25:27,956 --> 00:25:31,050
...no faith that comes from
the depths of his soul.

151
00:25:32,594 --> 00:25:34,255
No simplicity.

152
00:25:35,296 --> 00:25:41,292
As Epiphanius said in
"The Life of Saint Sergeius":

153
00:25:41,936 --> 00:25:44,029
"Simplicity, without gaudiness."

154
00:25:46,141 --> 00:25:49,770
That is what this is. It's sacred.

155
00:25:50,245 --> 00:25:55,239
Simplicity, without gaudiness...
you can't say it better.

156
00:25:55,316 --> 00:25:57,147
I see you are a wise man.

157
00:25:57,585 --> 00:25:59,849
If so, is that a good thing?

158
00:25:59,954 --> 00:26:05,290
If one is ignorant, isn't it better
to be guided by one's heart?

159
00:26:05,927 --> 00:26:08,953
In much wisdom
there is much grief...

160
00:26:09,698 --> 00:26:13,794
...and he who increases
knowledge increases sorrow.

161
00:26:20,341 --> 00:26:23,674
Proshka! Where is that oil?

162
00:26:24,045 --> 00:26:26,104
Whose ears should I box?

163
00:26:27,415 --> 00:26:29,542
It is as though the earth
has swallowed everyone.

164
00:26:29,617 --> 00:26:31,107
They say you paint quickly.

165
00:26:31,186 --> 00:26:34,417
I cannot work any
other way. I get bored.

166
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:37,617
I wasted a week on an icon once.

167
00:26:37,792 --> 00:26:38,986
You threw it away?

168
00:26:39,728 --> 00:26:43,186
No. I used the board
to press cabbage.

169
00:26:43,498 --> 00:26:46,467
It's all so boring.

170
00:26:46,968 --> 00:26:49,459
I have pupils and
assistants in abundance...

171
00:26:49,537 --> 00:26:50,731
...but none of them is any good.

172
00:26:50,805 --> 00:26:53,205
They can neither read nor write.

173
00:26:55,744 --> 00:26:58,975
Listen, help me. Be my assistant.

174
00:27:01,382 --> 00:27:03,441
Don't make fun of me.

175
00:27:03,518 --> 00:27:05,383
I'm not making fun of you.

176
00:27:05,553 --> 00:27:10,354
In spring, I must paint the Church
of the Annunciation in Moscow...

177
00:27:10,425 --> 00:27:12,017
...and I have no
assistants to do it with.

178
00:27:12,093 --> 00:27:14,357
The scaffolding is being built.

179
00:27:14,529 --> 00:27:16,861
- Do you understand?
- I do understand.

180
00:27:16,931 --> 00:27:18,330
But I wouldn't be able to cope.

181
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,200
I'll teach you. You never
prepared a wall for a fresco?

182
00:27:23,505 --> 00:27:28,306
You've a brain; even these
idiots can prepare a wall.

183
00:27:29,611 --> 00:27:31,738
I said no and I mean no.

184
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:33,811
You know best...

185
00:27:34,649 --> 00:27:39,211
...but mind you don't
regret it; I am rancorous.

186
00:27:39,487 --> 00:27:42,354
I may regret it, but it's a sin for you.

187
00:27:42,624 --> 00:27:45,855
An unknown monk comes to you...

188
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:49,019
...and you like the fact that you
can talk about books with him...

189
00:27:49,097 --> 00:27:50,826
...and you decide to
take him and favor him.

190
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:56,765
But I haven't looked at a book for
three years and I don't want to.

191
00:27:57,071 --> 00:28:00,040
- Why?
- I have a different road.

192
00:28:00,809 --> 00:28:03,972
Wicked bastards!

193
00:28:04,312 --> 00:28:06,303
Where is Proshka? Where is Vikenty?

194
00:28:06,381 --> 00:28:09,908
They ran to the square to see how
they were going to kill the ruler.

195
00:28:09,984 --> 00:28:13,249
Wicked bastards!

196
00:28:23,464 --> 00:28:25,193
See?

197
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:28,494
And you don't want to help?

198
00:28:39,347 --> 00:28:42,111
- I shall die soon.
- You shouldn't say that.

199
00:28:42,684 --> 00:28:47,314
The other night I
dreamed of an angel.

200
00:28:47,689 --> 00:28:50,123
He said: "Come with me."

201
00:28:50,959 --> 00:28:54,258
I said: " I shall die soon, without you."

202
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:10,802
You won't change
your mind, will you?

203
00:29:13,181 --> 00:29:17,083
Only on one condition.

204
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:20,645
Whatever you want.
Money? Half my fee, okay?

205
00:29:21,256 --> 00:29:25,920
No. I'll work for nothing
if you yourself...

206
00:29:28,029 --> 00:29:31,226
...come to Andronnikov
Monastery to fetch me.

207
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:37,166
Before the community, the
metropolitan, ask me to help you...

208
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,406
...before the brotherhood,
before Andrei Rublev.

209
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:45,805
Then I shall serve you like a slave...

210
00:29:46,414 --> 00:29:49,850
...like a dog, until the day I die.

211
00:29:50,218 --> 00:29:52,550
What is your name?

212
00:29:53,054 --> 00:29:54,282
Kirill.

213
00:30:02,797 --> 00:30:06,358
Orthodox Christians, lovers of truth.

214
00:30:06,834 --> 00:30:11,771
How long will this torture go
on, when will you end this?

215
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:15,999
You are thoughtless
sinners, yet you judge.

216
00:30:16,778 --> 00:30:20,771
You faithless heathens!

217
00:30:21,950 --> 00:30:23,850
He has already seven
times atoned for his sins...

218
00:30:23,918 --> 00:30:25,078
...for both his sins and yours.

219
00:30:25,153 --> 00:30:28,145
You are incredible
sinners yourselves.

220
00:30:28,222 --> 00:30:30,019
And you judge...

221
00:30:30,091 --> 00:30:32,616
...but you don't have God with you.

222
00:31:10,932 --> 00:31:14,129
Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth...

223
00:31:14,469 --> 00:31:19,065
...and let thy heart cheer thee
in the days of thy youth.

224
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:23,342
Walk in the ways of thine heart,
and in the sight of thine eyes...

225
00:31:23,511 --> 00:31:26,776
...but know that for all these...

226
00:31:27,015 --> 00:31:30,041
...God will bring thee into judgment.

227
00:31:41,195 --> 00:31:44,096
Remember now thy Creator
in the days of thy youth...

228
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:45,757
...before the difficult days come...

229
00:31:46,034 --> 00:31:49,162
...and the years draw nigh,
when thou shalt say...

230
00:31:49,404 --> 00:31:52,498
..."I have no pleasure in them."

231
00:31:53,741 --> 00:31:54,730
Remember thy Creator...

232
00:31:54,809 --> 00:31:57,710
...before the silver cord be loosed.
Or the golden bowl be broken...

233
00:31:57,945 --> 00:32:00,778
...or the pitcher
shattered at the fountain...

234
00:32:01,049 --> 00:32:03,984
...or the wheel broken at the well.

235
00:32:05,286 --> 00:32:08,847
Then shall the dust return
to the earth as it was...

236
00:32:09,157 --> 00:32:12,183
...and the spirit shall return
unto God who gave it.

237
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:17,261
"Vanity of vanities,"
saith the preacher; "All is vanity."

238
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:23,869
Kirill, have you seen Father Nikodim?

239
00:32:26,641 --> 00:32:30,042
Where has he got to
since this morning?

240
00:32:30,411 --> 00:32:34,973
He took my gloves, then disappeared
as though the earth swallowed him.

241
00:32:37,652 --> 00:32:41,281
I have to chop wood
and the logs are icy.

242
00:32:44,525 --> 00:32:48,655
Why is your candle
burning? It's daylight.

243
00:32:51,032 --> 00:32:53,398
Did you feed my dog?

244
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:56,428
Did you ask me to?

245
00:33:02,110 --> 00:33:03,907
What's the matter with you?

246
00:33:12,553 --> 00:33:13,542
Go away.

247
00:33:15,590 --> 00:33:19,356
The words of the wise are like
goads, and the words of scholars...

248
00:33:19,460 --> 00:33:22,520
...are like well-driven nails,
given by one Shepherd.

249
00:33:22,597 --> 00:33:26,624
And further, my son, you
should stay away from these.

250
00:33:26,968 --> 00:33:29,960
Of making many
books there is no end...

251
00:33:30,071 --> 00:33:33,006
...and much study is
wearisome to the flesh.

252
00:33:33,708 --> 00:33:36,006
Let us hear the conclusion
of the whole matter...

253
00:33:36,244 --> 00:33:38,269
Fear God and keep
His commandments...

254
00:33:38,346 --> 00:33:41,110
...for this is man's all.

255
00:33:41,749 --> 00:33:44,047
A messenger has come!

256
00:33:44,585 --> 00:33:47,918
Who has come? A messenger
from Moscow has come.

257
00:33:49,624 --> 00:33:51,819
A messenger has come
from the Grand Prince.

258
00:33:51,893 --> 00:33:54,054
- So?
- So so!

259
00:33:54,428 --> 00:33:57,158
A messenger from
Theophanes the Greek.

260
00:34:00,468 --> 00:34:03,631
The Grand Prince
orders you to Moscow...

261
00:34:03,771 --> 00:34:08,708
...to paint the Cathedral of the
Annunciation, with Theophanes.

262
00:34:14,549 --> 00:34:18,508
Is he really Andrei
Rublev, this fellow?

263
00:34:23,257 --> 00:34:26,454
Yes, he's Rublev... and I'm Kirill.

264
00:34:27,195 --> 00:34:31,564
Theophanes the Greek says
he wants you in Moscow...

265
00:34:31,999 --> 00:34:33,830
...and he wishes to see you.

266
00:34:34,835 --> 00:34:37,099
I thank Theophanes.

267
00:34:38,339 --> 00:34:39,363
Tell him...

268
00:34:42,276 --> 00:34:44,369
...that I'll come.

269
00:34:46,447 --> 00:34:47,607
I'll come.

270
00:34:50,451 --> 00:34:52,043
My head is splitting!

271
00:34:56,224 --> 00:34:58,055
Bring my horse here.

272
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:01,851
What is wrong?

273
00:35:05,700 --> 00:35:11,332
Choose whichever helpers you
like and be ready tomorrow.

274
00:35:12,006 --> 00:35:14,440
Is there a blacksmith
here? If not, I'll fall off again.

275
00:35:14,809 --> 00:35:19,212
There is a smithy outside,
beyond the chapel.

276
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,540
Farewell, God-fearing people!

277
00:35:27,054 --> 00:35:28,612
Semyon! Come here!

278
00:35:28,689 --> 00:35:30,520
Come here and help us!

279
00:35:30,591 --> 00:35:32,650
Why are you standing? Come here!

280
00:35:48,476 --> 00:35:51,411
Let's go today, shall we, Danil?

281
00:35:52,246 --> 00:35:58,116
Go quickly, before
Theophanes changes his mind.

282
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:00,647
I'm not going.

283
00:36:01,989 --> 00:36:03,115
Why aren't you going?

284
00:36:05,993 --> 00:36:08,723
How can I manage without you?

285
00:36:09,463 --> 00:36:10,930
As best you can.

286
00:36:14,568 --> 00:36:16,160
I thought we'd go together.

287
00:36:16,771 --> 00:36:20,867
Why did you think for
me? I was not invited.

288
00:36:26,747 --> 00:36:28,612
I can't do it without you.

289
00:36:30,117 --> 00:36:35,145
You can; you agreed
to go without asking me.

290
00:36:36,157 --> 00:36:38,284
Theophanes simply beckoned.

291
00:36:40,828 --> 00:36:44,821
Don't grieve; you're
not the first, or the last.

292
00:36:45,933 --> 00:36:48,424
Even without you there's
plenty of work for me here.

293
00:36:56,610 --> 00:36:57,975
Thank God for it.

294
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:02,343
Foma, Aleksei. Let's get ready.

295
00:37:03,517 --> 00:37:05,747
Piotr, you're coming with me.

296
00:37:31,879 --> 00:37:33,608
Did you forget something, Andrei?

297
00:37:36,083 --> 00:37:37,914
I came to say farewell.

298
00:37:40,121 --> 00:37:41,383
We've said farewell.

299
00:37:54,468 --> 00:37:56,868
I came to say farewell, but...

300
00:38:02,376 --> 00:38:05,174
It was hard for me before.

301
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:10,278
Then the devil created
enmity between us.

302
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,085
I can't go away like this.

303
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:18,385
I must make confession.

304
00:38:21,128 --> 00:38:22,527
Will you hear it?

305
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:34,136
I cannot do anything, Danil...

306
00:38:36,777 --> 00:38:40,008
...after living so many years
together in the same cell.

307
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:47,553
Apart from you, I have no one.

308
00:38:50,691 --> 00:38:53,717
I see the world with your eyes.

309
00:38:56,163 --> 00:38:57,653
I hear it with your ears...

310
00:39:00,401 --> 00:39:01,868
...with your heart.

311
00:39:10,544 --> 00:39:13,377
I am happy for you, you old fool.

312
00:39:13,781 --> 00:39:16,944
If only you knew how happy.

313
00:39:19,119 --> 00:39:22,748
Go to Moscow. Paint;
I shall be proud of you.

314
00:39:24,158 --> 00:39:28,322
The devil tempted me the
other day too. Forgive me.

315
00:39:55,689 --> 00:39:58,055
I'll come back, Danil.

316
00:40:12,740 --> 00:40:15,368
Where are you going?
What about Vespers?

317
00:40:15,609 --> 00:40:17,770
I'll manage without you.

318
00:40:18,345 --> 00:40:20,472
What's wrong with you today, Kirill?

319
00:40:21,949 --> 00:40:25,248
I'm tired of lying. I'm going
back into the secular world.

320
00:40:28,789 --> 00:40:31,155
Why did we leave
the Trinity Monastery?

321
00:40:31,659 --> 00:40:34,856
Andrei, Danil, you are
not saying anything.

322
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:39,058
Because the brothers valued
profit higher than faith.

323
00:40:40,067 --> 00:40:42,968
They forgot why they had
entered a monastery. And now?

324
00:40:43,704 --> 00:40:47,800
We sought to praise God with faith
and work, but what's happened?

325
00:40:48,075 --> 00:40:50,305
The monastery's become a bazaar.

326
00:40:50,844 --> 00:40:54,405
Servant of God, how many souls
did you trade in for monasticism?

327
00:40:54,481 --> 00:40:55,470
Twenty or thirty?

328
00:40:55,849 --> 00:40:59,250
And you ran after the
Father Superior, bargaining.

329
00:40:59,753 --> 00:41:04,781
For two meadows, or even one,
you bought eternal salvation.

330
00:41:05,793 --> 00:41:10,594
You don't need me to tell you,
but you prefer to keep quiet.

331
00:41:11,165 --> 00:41:15,932
Perhaps I would also tolerate all
this loathsomeness if I had talent.

332
00:41:16,804 --> 00:41:20,331
But what talent? Just a
slight ability to paint icons.

333
00:41:20,941 --> 00:41:24,741
God be praised that
He gave me no talent.

334
00:41:25,012 --> 00:41:30,143
I'm happy I'm untalented; I can
be honest and pure before God.

335
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:31,912
You are taking sin upon your soul!

336
00:41:31,986 --> 00:41:34,682
I'll tell you something else, brothers.

337
00:41:35,122 --> 00:41:38,785
What do you want to tell us
that we don't know already?

338
00:41:39,259 --> 00:41:44,629
Do you know what happens to your
sort? Speak! I won't get offended!

339
00:41:44,698 --> 00:41:45,687
Well, I...

340
00:41:45,766 --> 00:41:48,291
Get out, you dog!

341
00:41:48,736 --> 00:41:53,696
Out of my sight, you serpent!
Rejoin the secular world, slanderer!

342
00:41:54,375 --> 00:41:55,637
Now do you see?

343
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:56,999
Kirill!

344
00:41:58,812 --> 00:41:59,972
Kirill!

345
00:42:17,131 --> 00:42:21,591
It is written: " And Jesus
went into the temple of God...

346
00:42:21,835 --> 00:42:25,566
"...and cast out all them that
sold and bought in the temple...

347
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:29,339
"...and overthrew the tables
of the money changers...

348
00:42:29,743 --> 00:42:31,870
"...and the seats of them
that sold doves.

349
00:42:32,212 --> 00:42:36,774
" And said unto them," it is written,
" My house shall be called...

350
00:42:37,051 --> 00:42:41,681
"...the house of prayer; but ye
have made it a den of thieves."

351
00:43:41,648 --> 00:43:44,116
For three years I was
cleaning brushes for Danil...

352
00:43:44,184 --> 00:43:45,515
...before he let me touch an icon.

353
00:43:46,520 --> 00:43:48,215
And then only to clean it.

354
00:43:48,322 --> 00:43:49,516
Don't you trust me?

355
00:43:50,557 --> 00:43:53,082
You're always lying, Foma.

356
00:43:53,293 --> 00:43:57,525
Yesterday your robe was
sticky; where were you?

357
00:43:58,065 --> 00:43:59,191
At the beehive.

358
00:43:59,733 --> 00:44:02,793
But you said you
were at the monastery.

359
00:44:03,036 --> 00:44:05,027
Just look at yourself.

360
00:44:06,273 --> 00:44:09,140
Put mud or something
on your cheek...

361
00:44:09,676 --> 00:44:12,770
...or you will swell, like a hog.

362
00:44:13,514 --> 00:44:16,005
It's too late now, it's useless.

363
00:44:19,286 --> 00:44:21,516
You're constantly making up stories.

364
00:44:26,026 --> 00:44:28,654
I even think you have a disease.

365
00:44:29,096 --> 00:44:30,757
Me? What disease?

366
00:44:33,400 --> 00:44:41,398
There is a disease where a
man lies without stopping.

367
00:44:49,917 --> 00:44:51,077
Look, Foma.

368
00:44:53,453 --> 00:44:54,750
Look, I say.

369
00:44:56,456 --> 00:44:59,687
What?

370
00:45:01,395 --> 00:45:05,058
You think you know everything so
I'm not going to teach you any more.

371
00:45:07,134 --> 00:45:08,761
Why should I learn?

372
00:45:08,969 --> 00:45:11,460
Anyway, I will have to spend
three years cleaning the brushes.

373
00:45:12,206 --> 00:45:14,231
I'm sick and tired of you, Foma.

374
00:45:14,374 --> 00:45:17,275
Go back to the monastery,
go wherever you want.

375
00:45:33,060 --> 00:45:35,119
I can't understand why
I took you as a pupil.

376
00:45:35,429 --> 00:45:38,364
You are always like that. First
you say one thing then another.

377
00:45:38,632 --> 00:45:42,193
You yourself told
Theophanes I was perceptive.

378
00:45:42,469 --> 00:45:46,565
You were different then;
you worked, you didn't lie.

379
00:45:50,911 --> 00:45:53,072
And do you know
what Theophanes said?

380
00:45:53,146 --> 00:45:54,841
" What does it matter
if he's perceptive?"

381
00:45:56,516 --> 00:45:58,245
Whatever Theophanes has said...

382
00:45:58,352 --> 00:46:00,377
...I can see blue colors
better than anyone else.

383
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:07,751
You eat too much; how can you
paint with a bloated stomach?

384
00:46:08,095 --> 00:46:11,656
When your stomach's rumbling,
how can your mind work?

385
00:46:12,132 --> 00:46:14,896
The rumbling is the
only sound you hear.

386
00:46:17,137 --> 00:46:21,073
You're lucky, Foma. For
you, everything is simple.

387
00:46:21,141 --> 00:46:24,167
If you are not painting, you
are sleeping or fooling around.

388
00:46:25,245 --> 00:46:30,478
But only by prayer can
the soul transcend the flesh.

389
00:46:32,085 --> 00:46:34,918
Would you go to learn from
another teacher instead of me?

390
00:46:35,022 --> 00:46:37,684
Why not, if you tell me to go?

391
00:46:38,058 --> 00:46:40,618
Come on, come on. Don't be angry.

392
00:46:44,865 --> 00:46:45,854
What's that?

393
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:16,095
So you've decided to put
the apostle on the left, Andrei.

394
00:47:20,634 --> 00:47:22,898
Did you take the glue off the fire?

395
00:47:23,003 --> 00:47:24,834
Did you take the glue off the fire?

396
00:47:32,612 --> 00:47:34,671
Perceptive is he?

397
00:47:36,183 --> 00:47:38,947
He should be beaten
every Saturday, like a dog.

398
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,329
You're obstinate, Andrei.

399
00:49:02,969 --> 00:49:06,735
How did you see so much? Everyone
else is thinking only of himself.

400
00:49:07,107 --> 00:49:08,802
I saw it, Theophanes.

401
00:49:09,176 --> 00:49:12,043
The women of Moscow
gave their hair to the Tatars.

402
00:49:12,312 --> 00:49:15,145
What else could the
poor creatures do?

403
00:49:15,582 --> 00:49:19,848
Better to lose their hair than
be tortured. Is that heroic?

404
00:49:20,020 --> 00:49:21,009
It is.

405
00:49:22,022 --> 00:49:27,619
It is true that Russian women
are humiliated and unhappy.

406
00:49:29,463 --> 00:49:30,794
It's not what I mean.

407
00:49:31,031 --> 00:49:35,229
Tell me honestly, are the
people ignorant or not?

408
00:49:36,603 --> 00:49:38,093
Well, are they?

409
00:49:38,338 --> 00:49:41,330
They're ignorant, but
whose fault is that?

410
00:49:41,608 --> 00:49:46,170
It's their own stupidity. Have you
never sinned through ignorance?

411
00:49:46,913 --> 00:49:47,845
Everyone has.

412
00:49:48,215 --> 00:49:51,844
And I have too. God forgive
us and make us better.

413
00:49:52,786 --> 00:49:54,413
Well, never mind.

414
00:49:55,155 --> 00:49:59,091
The Last Judgment is coming;
we'll burn like candles.

415
00:49:59,693 --> 00:50:02,093
Mark my words.

416
00:50:03,263 --> 00:50:07,632
Each will accuse the other of
his own sins, to defend himself.

417
00:50:08,802 --> 00:50:14,104
Theophanes, how can you paint with
such ideas, even accept praise?

418
00:50:15,876 --> 00:50:19,539
I have become a hermit
and lived in a cave.

419
00:50:20,147 --> 00:50:22,547
I serve God, not man.

420
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:29,111
As regards praise, what is praised
today is abused tomorrow.

421
00:50:29,456 --> 00:50:32,823
They will forget you, me, everything.

422
00:50:33,360 --> 00:50:35,851
All is vanity and ashes. Worse
things have been forgotten.

423
00:50:37,531 --> 00:50:42,059
Humanity has already committed
every stupidity and baseness...

424
00:50:42,903 --> 00:50:44,837
...and now it only repeats them.

425
00:50:45,906 --> 00:50:50,002
Everything is an eternal circle
and it repeats and repeats itself.

426
00:50:50,810 --> 00:50:54,871
If Jesus returned to earth,
they would crucify him again.

427
00:50:55,115 --> 00:50:57,709
Of course, if only
evil is remembered...

428
00:50:58,985 --> 00:51:01,317
...then you will never be
happy in the sight of God.

429
00:51:03,223 --> 00:51:05,384
Perhaps we must forget
some things; but not all.

430
00:51:07,694 --> 00:51:09,559
I don't know how to say it.

431
00:51:09,863 --> 00:51:12,491
Then be quiet and listen to me.

432
00:51:17,003 --> 00:51:19,733
You think that one can
only do good alone?

433
00:51:20,373 --> 00:51:23,831
Good. Remember
the New Testament.

434
00:51:25,512 --> 00:51:29,278
Jesus taught people in the temples...

435
00:51:30,050 --> 00:51:33,816
...so why did they
gather later? To kill him!

436
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:37,313
"Crucify him!" they shouted.

437
00:51:38,458 --> 00:51:42,189
And the disciples? Judas
sold Him. Peter denied Him.

438
00:51:43,430 --> 00:51:46,763
They all ran away,
yet they were the best.

439
00:51:47,467 --> 00:51:49,196
But they repented.

440
00:51:49,703 --> 00:51:53,833
That was afterwards,
when it was too late.

441
00:51:56,476 --> 00:52:00,207
It's never too late to repent.

442
00:52:12,192 --> 00:52:14,524
Of course, people do evil.

443
00:52:14,594 --> 00:52:19,224
But you can not
blame them altogether.

444
00:52:19,532 --> 00:52:20,999
It's difficult...

445
00:52:21,735 --> 00:52:23,498
...and sinful, I think.

446
00:52:24,671 --> 00:52:28,903
Judas sold the Christ, and
remember who bought him.

447
00:52:29,342 --> 00:52:30,366
People.

448
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:33,504
And who accused Jesus?

449
00:52:34,414 --> 00:52:36,678
The scribes and Pharisees...

450
00:52:37,017 --> 00:52:39,485
...they could not find witnesses,
however hard they tried.

451
00:52:40,854 --> 00:52:43,254
"Who will testify against this innocent?"

452
00:52:44,424 --> 00:52:46,551
Only later on they found the traitors.

453
00:52:46,626 --> 00:52:49,060
Two were found immediately.
Two, and not one.

454
00:52:50,563 --> 00:52:52,053
There were only two.

455
00:52:52,866 --> 00:52:57,428
The Pharisees were
masters of deceit, educated.

456
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:01,505
They had studied to gain power...

457
00:53:01,574 --> 00:53:03,508
...to take advantage of
the people's ignorance.

458
00:53:05,312 --> 00:53:08,907
We must remind people more
often that they are people.

459
00:53:09,249 --> 00:53:13,208
Russians, of the same
blood, of the same land.

460
00:53:14,688 --> 00:53:16,747
Evil is everywhere.

461
00:53:16,823 --> 00:53:20,816
Someone will always sell
you for thirty pieces of silver.

462
00:53:21,995 --> 00:53:25,692
New misfortunes constantly
befall the peasant...

463
00:53:25,799 --> 00:53:30,099
...either Tatars three times an
autumn, or famine, or plague...

464
00:53:30,737 --> 00:53:34,298
...and he still keeps on
working, working, working...

465
00:53:34,374 --> 00:53:36,535
...meekly bearing his cross.

466
00:53:36,609 --> 00:53:40,477
He does not despair,
he is silent and patient.

467
00:53:40,980 --> 00:53:44,040
He only prays to God
for enough strength.

468
00:53:45,618 --> 00:53:49,145
How could God not
forgive him his ignorance?

469
00:53:50,390 --> 00:53:57,319
You know yourself. You're
tired and discouraged...

470
00:53:57,964 --> 00:53:59,056
...and suddenly...

471
00:53:59,265 --> 00:54:02,962
...in the crowd you
meet a human glance...

472
00:54:03,536 --> 00:54:07,734
...and everything's lighter,
as it is after Communion.

473
00:54:08,475 --> 00:54:09,965
Isn't it so?

474
00:54:12,979 --> 00:54:15,379
You just spoke of Jesus.

475
00:54:16,082 --> 00:54:21,816
Perhaps He was born and
crucified to reconcile God and man.

476
00:54:22,555 --> 00:54:25,217
Jesus came from God,
so He is all-powerful.

477
00:54:26,159 --> 00:54:30,926
And if He died on the cross,
it was predetermined...

478
00:54:31,664 --> 00:54:35,191
...and His crucifixion
and death were God's will.

479
00:54:35,402 --> 00:54:37,893
That would have aroused hatred
not in those who crucified Him...

480
00:54:37,971 --> 00:54:39,233
...but in those who loved Him...

481
00:54:39,339 --> 00:54:44,174
...if they had been near
Him at that moment...

482
00:54:45,578 --> 00:54:48,376
...because they loved
Him as a man only.

483
00:54:49,416 --> 00:54:52,317
But if He, of His own will, left them...

484
00:54:52,485 --> 00:54:56,785
...He displayed injustice,
or even cruelty.

485
00:54:57,957 --> 00:55:00,949
Maybe those who
crucified Him loved Him...

486
00:55:01,995 --> 00:55:05,396
...because they helped
in this divine plan.

487
00:56:26,646 --> 00:56:29,080
Do you understand
what you are saying?

488
00:56:30,183 --> 00:56:35,018
They'll exile you to the north,
man, to renovate the icons.

489
00:56:35,121 --> 00:56:40,184
Am I not right? You too
always say what you think.

490
00:56:40,360 --> 00:56:45,730
But I'm not a monk; I'm free.

491
00:57:01,847 --> 00:57:06,614
THE HOLID AY
Spring 1 408

492
00:57:22,401 --> 00:57:23,925
Sergei, over here!

493
00:57:24,837 --> 00:57:26,429
Light the fire.

494
00:57:28,074 --> 00:57:30,804
Foma, let's get some logs.

495
00:57:35,948 --> 00:57:38,007
Piotr has probably never seen...

496
00:57:38,084 --> 00:57:40,314
...either Assumption Cathedral
or Saint Dmitry Cathedral.

497
00:57:41,187 --> 00:57:46,420
Never mind, he will begin
working, and understand things.

498
00:57:47,793 --> 00:57:50,284
Foma! Where are you?

499
00:57:50,529 --> 00:57:52,588
We won't be on time.

500
00:57:53,032 --> 00:57:54,431
It's okay, we'll be there tomorrow.

501
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,965
No. We'll never finish the Cathedral
of the Assumption by winter.

502
00:57:58,104 --> 00:57:59,435
It's almost June, Andrei.

503
00:58:09,382 --> 00:58:10,371
What is it?

504
00:58:11,384 --> 00:58:13,852
Quiet! Do you hear it?

505
00:58:17,623 --> 00:58:18,885
Nightingales?

506
00:58:19,258 --> 00:58:20,589
Nothing else?

507
00:58:27,066 --> 00:58:27,998
Come on.

508
00:58:30,236 --> 00:58:32,704
- What is it?
- Come on.

509
00:58:49,021 --> 00:58:50,716
They're practicing witchcraft.

510
00:58:57,930 --> 00:58:59,158
Where are you going?

511
00:59:58,357 --> 00:59:59,517
Come to me.

512
01:00:00,025 --> 01:00:01,959
Hold on.

513
01:00:02,194 --> 01:00:03,491
Come to me.

514
01:00:06,465 --> 01:00:08,399
Darling.

515
01:00:09,368 --> 01:00:10,960
Take your hand away.

516
01:00:20,613 --> 01:00:23,207
There is an anthill.

517
01:00:23,282 --> 01:00:24,806
Anthill?

518
01:00:24,917 --> 01:00:25,941
Anthill.

519
01:00:26,652 --> 01:00:28,779
- Who is this?
- I don't know.

520
01:00:29,155 --> 01:00:30,679
Let's go.

521
01:02:11,790 --> 01:02:13,758
It seemed to me...

522
01:02:14,159 --> 01:02:15,956
...as if a black snake
was hiding himself.

523
01:02:16,061 --> 01:02:19,189
What are you doing?

524
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:22,531
Let me go!

525
01:02:22,768 --> 01:02:24,963
We'll let you go.

526
01:02:25,070 --> 01:02:29,268
At dawn, we'll hang a stone around
your neck, to help you swim.

527
01:02:32,544 --> 01:02:36,878
Heaven's fire will consume you!
The Last Judgment awaits!

528
01:02:38,050 --> 01:02:40,780
Now we'll tie you to this cross...

529
01:02:42,354 --> 01:02:44,652
...like Jesus Christ.

530
01:02:46,191 --> 01:02:50,753
What are you doing, men?
You can't do this to me.

531
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:55,323
This is a sin. At least
hang me upside-down.

532
01:02:55,935 --> 01:02:58,426
Men, brothers!

533
01:03:03,242 --> 01:03:08,305
Leave him here for the night,
unless he ascends again.

534
01:03:11,050 --> 01:03:12,915
He's not going anywhere.

535
01:03:26,966 --> 01:03:29,161
- And who is this?
- Marfa.

536
01:03:32,371 --> 01:03:37,001
Why did you want to be head
down? It would have been worse.

537
01:03:40,112 --> 01:03:42,910
Why did you threaten us
with fire from heaven?

538
01:03:44,383 --> 01:03:47,841
It is a sin to go naked
and do what you do.

539
01:03:50,289 --> 01:03:56,524
What sin? Tonight is for
lovemaking; is love a sin?

540
01:03:57,062 --> 01:03:59,826
Is it love to tie a man up like this?

541
01:04:01,433 --> 01:04:03,458
You might call the monks...

542
01:04:04,303 --> 01:04:06,533
...who would force us
to accept your faith.

543
01:04:06,872 --> 01:04:09,670
Do you think it's easy to live in fear?

544
01:04:10,342 --> 01:04:13,743
You live in fear because you
know no love but bestial love.

545
01:04:14,113 --> 01:04:18,174
Carnality without soul; but
love should be brotherly.

546
01:04:19,918 --> 01:04:22,478
Isn't all love the same? It's just love.

547
01:04:28,293 --> 01:04:29,282
What are you doing?

548
01:04:41,540 --> 01:04:42,837
Untie me.

549
01:07:55,133 --> 01:07:56,998
Why are you looking at me?

550
01:07:57,936 --> 01:07:59,301
Where were you?

551
01:08:04,509 --> 01:08:06,067
Thank God.

552
01:08:12,384 --> 01:08:14,579
Are these the people?

553
01:08:14,686 --> 01:08:17,746
No, these are strangers.
Don't you see it?

554
01:08:25,297 --> 01:08:27,765
There is some onion, if you want it.

555
01:08:36,375 --> 01:08:37,603
Where were you?

556
01:08:42,314 --> 01:08:46,307
These forests are impenetrable;
I'm all scratched.

557
01:08:48,487 --> 01:08:51,456
The local people like it.
They are accustomed to it.

558
01:08:52,090 --> 01:08:55,389
For people, everything
is a matter of custom.

559
01:08:56,161 --> 01:08:58,925
Old people don't need to think...

560
01:08:59,498 --> 01:09:02,990
...for their days pass
according to custom.

561
01:09:04,169 --> 01:09:09,698
But perhaps they consciously
enjoy the way the days drag on.

562
01:09:30,696 --> 01:09:33,187
- Couldn't you get here before?
- No. I couldn't.

563
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,268
That is your sin, your
conscience, your prayers.

564
01:09:44,443 --> 01:09:46,468
Get him, and her!

565
01:10:04,463 --> 01:10:07,364
Why are they doing that?

566
01:10:07,999 --> 01:10:11,662
Because the accursed pagans
don't believe in one God.

567
01:10:12,204 --> 01:10:17,301
Don't look, Sergei. There
is nothing to look at.

568
01:10:18,977 --> 01:10:20,808
Let me go!

569
01:10:24,049 --> 01:10:25,641
- Let me go!
- You can't see that!

570
01:10:35,727 --> 01:10:38,628
Kick him so he shuts up!

571
01:10:45,070 --> 01:10:47,129
Go, go! Don't dawdle!

572
01:10:54,780 --> 01:10:57,408
Help, Fyodor! Help!

573
01:11:00,752 --> 01:11:01,810
Fyodor!

574
01:11:03,021 --> 01:11:05,990
Can't you deal with a woman?

575
01:11:07,192 --> 01:11:09,319
Stop!

576
01:11:10,061 --> 01:11:11,494
Hold her!

577
01:11:17,269 --> 01:11:19,134
Marfa, run!

578
01:11:19,204 --> 01:11:21,570
Catch her!

579
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:24,507
- Where are you going?
- She will drown herself!

580
01:11:24,709 --> 01:11:28,270
Marfa! Run, Marfa!

581
01:11:33,318 --> 01:11:35,548
Swim, Marfa!

582
01:12:29,207 --> 01:12:34,509
THE LAST JUDGMENT
Summer 1 408

583
01:12:36,114 --> 01:12:37,138
Come here!

584
01:12:40,685 --> 01:12:42,619
He's just wasting materials.

585
01:12:42,854 --> 01:12:45,118
Who needs it?

586
01:12:47,692 --> 01:12:48,681
Foma!

587
01:12:49,194 --> 01:12:52,721
- What do you want?
- Can I go for a swim?

588
01:12:52,831 --> 01:12:55,766
- No, you can't.
- It's hot!

589
01:12:56,635 --> 01:12:58,432
Don't be lying. It's not.

590
01:12:58,737 --> 01:13:01,433
Maybe he's really hot. I'm hot too.

591
01:13:01,640 --> 01:13:03,767
Of course, you are
working and he is sitting.

592
01:13:03,875 --> 01:13:05,934
Let him go swim.

593
01:13:06,077 --> 01:13:07,977
Don't spoil him.

594
01:13:08,280 --> 01:13:09,611
Let him be sitting with everyone.

595
01:13:09,681 --> 01:13:11,615
You shut up!

596
01:13:11,783 --> 01:13:15,116
You sleep all day long like a log...

597
01:13:15,654 --> 01:13:19,021
...and you come down only
to eat and go to the bathroom.

598
01:13:19,524 --> 01:13:22,015
And have you found a job for me?

599
01:13:22,093 --> 01:13:24,926
- You have found what you wanted.
- So what?

600
01:13:26,064 --> 01:13:28,794
Since everyone is sitting here,
let Serezhka be sitting with us too.

601
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,095
If you had let him go, he
would have been back already.

602
01:13:31,269 --> 01:13:33,260
Give him freedom...

603
01:13:33,338 --> 01:13:35,363
...and he will sit in the
water until he turns blue.

604
01:13:35,440 --> 01:13:37,374
He only thinks that it's hot...

605
01:13:37,442 --> 01:13:39,910
...and that's why he is whining.
- He's not whining, you are.

606
01:13:39,978 --> 01:13:40,910
It was me.

607
01:13:40,979 --> 01:13:43,880
I was the first to say
it's hot, and not Sergei.

608
01:13:43,949 --> 01:13:45,314
Why are you picking on Sergei?

609
01:13:46,785 --> 01:13:48,184
That's it!

610
01:13:48,587 --> 01:13:50,350
You want to go swimming, go!

611
01:13:50,755 --> 01:13:52,882
Go! Why are you sitting?

612
01:13:53,858 --> 01:13:55,826
Go, go!

613
01:13:56,928 --> 01:13:57,917
Here! You see?

614
01:13:58,530 --> 01:14:00,555
Wait! Wait!

615
01:14:03,874 --> 01:14:04,966
Where's Andrei?

616
01:14:05,976 --> 01:14:09,571
Not here? This is a
fine state of affairs.

617
01:14:14,685 --> 01:14:16,710
I was at our bishop's house just now.

618
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:21,756
Such a fuss. Yelling!

619
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:27,024
He was purple with rage.
" I've lost patience!" he cried.

620
01:14:27,364 --> 01:14:30,094
He meant you. All of you.

621
01:14:31,001 --> 01:14:34,300
" For two whole months," he said,
"everything has been ready.

622
01:14:34,371 --> 01:14:35,633
" But they haven't started yet.

623
01:14:35,706 --> 01:14:40,268
" Nothing is ready; they asked for
so much money, but do nothing.

624
01:14:40,811 --> 01:14:43,871
" None of them is working
and nothing is ready."

625
01:14:44,682 --> 01:14:47,344
Did you ask for a lot of money?

626
01:14:47,518 --> 01:14:49,110
How do I know?

627
01:14:49,386 --> 01:14:52,549
He said, " I don't care. Danil
Chorny or Andrei Rublev...

628
01:14:52,623 --> 01:14:54,557
"...it's all the same to me."

629
01:14:55,192 --> 01:14:58,093
" It's all the same."

630
01:14:58,729 --> 01:15:01,197
And he pulled a face like this.

631
01:15:04,535 --> 01:15:07,868
" What do I care
about Andrei Rublev?

632
01:15:10,407 --> 01:15:11,999
" By autumn," he says...

633
01:15:12,810 --> 01:15:15,301
"...I want the cathedral
painted, and that's that!"

634
01:15:16,313 --> 01:15:20,249
He's sent a courier with a
complaint to the Grand Prince.

635
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:23,414
He's sent a courier
to the Grand Prince.

636
01:15:24,088 --> 01:15:26,579
It's a complaint about you, you know.

637
01:15:28,692 --> 01:15:31,354
You haven't started yet.

638
01:15:33,063 --> 01:15:38,057
You'd better hurry
up. Where's Andrei?

639
01:15:39,203 --> 01:15:41,103
He's gone somewhere again.

640
01:15:41,438 --> 01:15:43,463
Can't you start without him?

641
01:15:44,475 --> 01:15:46,238
Go on, start without him.

642
01:15:48,846 --> 01:15:51,576
Why are you smirking?
There are so many of you.

643
01:15:52,516 --> 01:15:55,314
If he can't make his mind
up, can't one of you?

644
01:15:55,386 --> 01:15:57,320
Two heads are better than one.

645
01:15:59,023 --> 01:16:00,388
Where is Andrei?

646
01:16:04,461 --> 01:16:06,088
I can't go on like that.

647
01:16:06,230 --> 01:16:07,925
Answer me: yes or no?

648
01:16:08,532 --> 01:16:11,831
Yes or no? Wasn't
everything decided in Moscow?

649
01:16:13,103 --> 01:16:18,097
To the smallest detail; the Prince
said everything was in order.

650
01:16:20,144 --> 01:16:25,241
What is not clear? What have we
been discussing for two months?

651
01:16:27,217 --> 01:16:30,050
Explain it to me. I may be
old, I may have lost my wits.

652
01:16:33,424 --> 01:16:35,790
The Last Judgment; either you
accept the task and paint it...

653
01:16:36,927 --> 01:16:39,020
...or you refuse the commission.

654
01:16:39,296 --> 01:16:42,959
And if we really refused?
If we went back, Danil?

655
01:16:43,333 --> 01:16:46,666
How shall I face people?
I should die of shame.

656
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:52,074
We're wasting such good
time. This heat, no rain.

657
01:16:53,777 --> 01:16:57,008
We could have finished
the cupola and the columns.

658
01:16:58,315 --> 01:17:00,408
How wonderfully they
could have been done...

659
01:17:00,884 --> 01:17:02,613
...how brightly, and beautifully.

660
01:17:03,887 --> 01:17:05,548
On the right, the sinners...

661
01:17:06,423 --> 01:17:09,859
...boiling in pitch, painted
to make your flesh crawl.

662
01:17:12,296 --> 01:17:15,732
I have thought of a great devil,
with smoke from his nose and eyes.

663
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:19,992
- It's not the smoke that matters.
- Then what matters?

664
01:17:20,104 --> 01:17:21,093
I don't know.

665
01:17:21,472 --> 01:17:24,032
- Why aren't you looking at me?
- Because I can't.

666
01:17:40,491 --> 01:17:45,121
I can't paint all that; it disgusts me.

667
01:17:47,364 --> 01:17:50,424
I don't want to terrify people.
Understand me, Danil.

668
01:17:52,436 --> 01:17:55,371
Collect yourself! Listen!
It's the Last Judgment!

669
01:17:55,973 --> 01:17:57,531
I didn't invent it.

670
01:17:57,608 --> 01:17:59,906
I can't do it. Do as
you will, but I can't.

671
01:18:00,043 --> 01:18:02,671
Why didn't you speak
earlier, in Moscow?

672
01:18:03,280 --> 01:18:04,838
You shouldn't have agreed.

673
01:18:07,151 --> 01:18:08,550
This is dishonest.

674
01:18:08,652 --> 01:18:11,644
I am what I am. You
couldn't teach me integrity.

675
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:31,335
I don't know what to paint.

676
01:18:32,309 --> 01:18:33,867
What do you mean, you don't know?

677
01:18:35,145 --> 01:18:37,409
We were ordered to
paint the Last Judgment.

678
01:18:40,050 --> 01:18:41,711
You see...

679
01:18:43,053 --> 01:18:44,953
...I think it will be better...

680
01:18:45,255 --> 01:18:47,621
...if we don't paint the
Last Judgment at all.

681
01:18:49,826 --> 01:18:50,850
What do you mean?

682
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:54,191
You know.

683
01:18:56,099 --> 01:18:57,396
I want...

684
01:19:06,276 --> 01:19:07,937
I don't want anything.

685
01:19:08,545 --> 01:19:10,775
- Nothing.
- That's it.

686
01:19:17,621 --> 01:19:19,589
Well, I'm leaving.

687
01:19:21,291 --> 01:19:23,987
This is no work for me.

688
01:19:24,995 --> 01:19:29,932
Thanks for your kindness and
your slaps; I learned something.

689
01:19:30,934 --> 01:19:33,232
But now I'm going to work for myself.

690
01:19:36,139 --> 01:19:38,471
They've asked me to
paint a church at Pafnutievo.

691
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:41,740
Not a great honor,
but it's still an honor.

692
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:46,576
I'm going to paint the Last Judgment.

693
01:19:48,719 --> 01:19:50,016
Who will come with me?

694
01:19:54,124 --> 01:19:55,648
Well, then, stay...

695
01:19:57,361 --> 01:19:59,329
...but don't complain later.

696
01:20:16,146 --> 01:20:17,807
When I was a child...

697
01:20:18,348 --> 01:20:23,650
...I spake as a child, I understood
as a child, I thought as a child...

698
01:20:24,354 --> 01:20:27,152
...but when I became a man,
I put away childish things.

699
01:20:27,958 --> 01:20:31,894
For now we see
through a glass, darkly...

700
01:20:32,429 --> 01:20:33,896
...but then face to face...

701
01:20:34,865 --> 01:20:36,389
...now I know in part...

702
01:20:36,933 --> 01:20:38,924
...but then shall I know...

703
01:20:39,002 --> 01:20:40,230
...even as also I am known.

704
01:20:41,338 --> 01:20:43,670
And now abideth...

705
01:20:44,107 --> 01:20:46,200
...faith, hope, and charity...

706
01:20:46,977 --> 01:20:48,945
...but the greatest of these is charity.

707
01:20:49,746 --> 01:20:53,443
Though I speak with the
tongues of men and of angels...

708
01:20:53,517 --> 01:20:54,848
...and have not charity...

709
01:20:55,218 --> 01:20:57,880
...I am become as sounding
brass, or a tinkling cymbal.

710
01:20:58,288 --> 01:20:59,846
And though I have
the gift of prophecy...

711
01:20:59,923 --> 01:21:01,914
...and understand all
mysteries, and all knowledge...

712
01:21:01,992 --> 01:21:06,554
...and though I have all faith, so
that I could remove mountains...

713
01:21:06,663 --> 01:21:08,893
...and have not charity, I am nothing.

714
01:21:09,266 --> 01:21:15,296
And though I bestow all
my goods to feed the poor...

715
01:21:16,506 --> 01:21:19,031
...and though I give my body to
be burned, and have not charity...

716
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:22,568
...it profiteth me nothing.

717
01:21:22,779 --> 01:21:26,840
Charity suffereth long, and
is kind; charity envieth not...

718
01:21:26,917 --> 01:21:28,817
...charity vaunteth not
itself, is not puffed up...

719
01:21:30,087 --> 01:21:32,885
...doth not behave
itself unseemly...

720
01:21:32,956 --> 01:21:36,551
...seeketh not her own, is not
easily provoked, thinketh no evil...

721
01:21:38,762 --> 01:21:40,957
...rejoiceth not in iniquity,
but rejoiceth in the truth...

722
01:21:41,031 --> 01:21:44,467
...beareth all things...

723
01:21:44,568 --> 01:21:48,095
...believeth all things, hopeth
all things, endureth all things.

724
01:21:50,507 --> 01:21:52,702
Charity never faileth...

725
01:21:55,112 --> 01:21:57,342
...but whether there be
prophecies, they shall fail...

726
01:21:57,414 --> 01:21:59,348
...whether there be
tongues, they shall cease...

727
01:22:00,217 --> 01:22:02,378
...whether there be
knowledge, it shall vanish away.

728
01:22:03,587 --> 01:22:05,316
For we know in part...

729
01:22:07,657 --> 01:22:11,058
Princess, is that nice?

730
01:22:12,162 --> 01:22:14,255
It's sinful to splash milk.

731
01:22:15,265 --> 01:22:17,631
Such a naughtiness.

732
01:22:20,837 --> 01:22:24,568
- Why is it sinful?
- Because... wipe it off.

733
01:22:25,942 --> 01:22:28,240
But it will dry by itself in a minute.

734
01:22:29,379 --> 01:22:32,314
Let's walk by the stream.

735
01:22:35,952 --> 01:22:38,978
Let me go, Stepan, or I'll
send you to the stables.

736
01:22:43,460 --> 01:22:45,087
How do you like it?

737
01:22:46,663 --> 01:22:51,225
I couldn't imagine it
better. It's light, beautiful.

738
01:23:01,778 --> 01:23:03,006
It's light.

739
01:23:05,115 --> 01:23:09,575
Take her out. Her
nurses have spoiled her.

740
01:23:09,653 --> 01:23:11,120
I say!

741
01:23:11,188 --> 01:23:14,180
No one can build a
mansion better than us.

742
01:23:14,458 --> 01:23:16,619
Who could paint like that?

743
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:17,749
Look at the carving.

744
01:23:17,828 --> 01:23:21,992
Only Mitiai can do this
directly, without tracing.

745
01:23:22,132 --> 01:23:24,100
It's like a bird singing.

746
01:23:25,735 --> 01:23:27,726
Look. Maybe it is like a bird singing.

747
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:33,674
I don't care. I can sleep on the
hay. You are the Grand Prince.

748
01:23:33,844 --> 01:23:35,607
Don't you like it?

749
01:23:35,679 --> 01:23:38,147
I'll tell you this. It
should be repainted.

750
01:23:38,582 --> 01:23:41,210
Walls, ceiling, everything:
brighter, stronger colors.

751
01:23:43,887 --> 01:23:45,514
I've been in this trade for forty years.

752
01:23:45,655 --> 01:23:47,020
It's not the years that matter...

753
01:23:47,157 --> 01:23:49,625
...but your ability to glorify the
Grand Prince with your work.

754
01:23:49,693 --> 01:23:51,524
That's enough. Go.

755
01:23:53,964 --> 01:23:56,364
We won't redo anything.

756
01:23:56,666 --> 01:24:00,329
It's time to go. We have another job.

757
01:24:00,403 --> 01:24:02,268
They are waiting for us in Z venigorod.

758
01:24:03,173 --> 01:24:04,162
Where?

759
01:24:04,241 --> 01:24:07,574
At your brother's. They
have the stone already.

760
01:24:09,012 --> 01:24:11,378
A beautiful stone. Whiter than this.

761
01:24:12,349 --> 01:24:14,783
When your brother came at Easter...

762
01:24:15,585 --> 01:24:20,022
...we made a deal and he said: " Do
what you like, whatever the cost.

763
01:24:21,791 --> 01:24:25,454
" I'll tax the peasants more, just
build me the best mansion possible."

764
01:24:26,563 --> 01:24:28,929
Then go to Z venigorod.

765
01:24:33,169 --> 01:24:34,761
Here, I have brought it.

766
01:24:39,442 --> 01:24:42,468
When I looked at the
Prince, he became numb.

767
01:24:42,546 --> 01:24:47,643
- When I mentioned Z venigorod?
- Yes, he became paralyzed.

768
01:24:47,817 --> 01:24:50,809
He fears his brother will outshine him.

769
01:24:52,422 --> 01:24:55,391
- Who carved that?
- I did.

770
01:24:57,494 --> 01:24:59,359
Why didn't you set it in the wall?

771
01:25:00,196 --> 01:25:01,788
It didn't come out right.

772
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:03,662
Pity; it's rather good.

773
01:25:05,368 --> 01:25:10,465
Everything crumbles: I told the Prince
to spare no expense on the stone.

774
01:25:11,174 --> 01:25:14,666
Maybe now he's sorry when
he heard about Z venigorod.

775
01:25:15,445 --> 01:25:17,413
I could have carved
beautiful things for him.

776
01:25:22,152 --> 01:25:25,485
Come on, you ass!

777
01:25:40,403 --> 01:25:41,700
Where's Stepan?

778
01:25:44,407 --> 01:25:46,602
Where did Stepan gallop to?

779
01:25:47,344 --> 01:25:49,505
He went to Z venigorod
with the others.

780
01:25:57,387 --> 01:25:59,617
I've dirtied my hands.

781
01:26:17,107 --> 01:26:21,009
We'll build another mansion just
as good for the Prince's brother.

782
01:26:21,945 --> 01:26:24,277
Will the stone be better there?

783
01:26:25,081 --> 01:26:26,480
Yes, it will.

784
01:26:27,617 --> 01:26:29,642
Look, the Captain of the Guard.

785
01:26:39,629 --> 01:26:40,994
Hold on, old man.

786
01:27:24,708 --> 01:27:28,235
You, ass! Help him! In the bushes!

787
01:27:39,222 --> 01:27:40,621
Where's my whip?

788
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:06,148
Has anyone seen my whip?

789
01:28:08,118 --> 01:28:11,781
Damn. I've lost it. Have
you seen my whip, ass?

790
01:30:38,835 --> 01:30:40,803
- Seryoga.
- What?

791
01:30:41,704 --> 01:30:43,137
Read the Scriptures.

792
01:30:43,506 --> 01:30:44,495
From where?

793
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:46,769
From wherever you like.

794
01:30:57,720 --> 01:31:01,281
" lmitate me, just as
I also imitate Christ.

795
01:31:01,491 --> 01:31:06,428
" Now I praise you, brethren, that
ye remember me in all things...

796
01:31:06,496 --> 01:31:08,623
"...and keep the ordinances

797
01:31:08,698 --> 01:31:13,829
" But I would have you know, that
the head of every man is Christ...

798
01:31:13,903 --> 01:31:15,734

799
01:31:15,805 --> 01:31:17,670
"...and the head of Christ is God.

"...dishonoreth his head. But every
woman that prayeth or prophesieth...

802
01:31:28,184 --> 01:31:31,745
"...with her head uncovered,
dishonoreth her head...

803
01:31:31,821 --> 01:31:35,018
"...for that is even all one

"...but the woman is

"...neither the woman

816
01:32:19,235 --> 01:32:21,533
Go on reading.

817
01:32:21,604 --> 01:32:27,167
" For as the woman is of the
man, even so is the man...

818

"...for her hair is given her for..."

825
01:33:40,950 --> 01:33:44,351
Why have you stopped? Read.

826
01:33:45,955 --> 01:33:50,449
"But if a woman have long
hair, it is a glory for her...

827
01:33:50,526 --> 01:33:53,120

833
01:34:07,376 --> 01:34:08,673
"...but for the worse."

834
01:34:47,250 --> 01:34:48,911
Danil, listen.

835
01:34:50,386 --> 01:34:51,284
It's a feast.

836
01:34:52,522 --> 01:34:54,319
It's a feast, Danil,
and you are saying...

837
01:34:54,957 --> 01:34:57,585
They are not sinners...

838
01:34:59,162 --> 01:35:01,392
She is not a sinner, even if
she does not wear a scarf.

839
01:35:14,277 --> 01:35:16,142
She is not a sinner.

840
01:35:43,639 --> 01:35:47,473
Leave him alone. Let
God's servant repent.

841
01:36:42,465 --> 01:36:49,462
The Passion According to Andrei
Part Two

842
01:36:50,506 --> 01:36:55,068
THE R AID
Autumn of 1 408

843
01:37:14,897 --> 01:37:18,663
They are coming! The
Tatars are coming, Prince!

844
01:38:07,383 --> 01:38:10,147
Hey, Prince! Is this your ford?

845
01:38:11,053 --> 01:38:15,285
It has been raining, and
everything is flooded. Follow us.

846
01:38:45,254 --> 01:38:48,121
We were just going to leave.
We expected you yesterday.

847
01:38:48,924 --> 01:38:53,827
I couldn't resist attacking
a small town on my way.

848
01:38:53,963 --> 01:38:54,952
I am sorry I am late.

849
01:38:55,130 --> 01:38:57,997
Never mind. Let's go. It will be
shallow to the left. Keep to the left.

850
01:39:02,771 --> 01:39:04,966
This isn't a trap?

851
01:39:05,341 --> 01:39:07,332
Believe me, Vladimir is deserted.

852
01:39:07,476 --> 01:39:10,411
My brother, the Grand
Prince, is in Lithuania.

853
01:39:10,579 --> 01:39:12,604
Here is the town, behind that forest.

854
01:39:13,249 --> 01:39:17,015
They say the Prince has a
son, but you want the throne.

855
01:39:18,554 --> 01:39:19,919
We'll see.

856
01:39:21,323 --> 01:39:24,292
I see you want the
throne. I understand.

857
01:39:30,032 --> 01:39:31,624
You were told to keep left.

858
01:39:37,806 --> 01:39:38,966
Grab this!

859
01:41:13,736 --> 01:41:16,227
Come on, Prince! Don't lag behind!

860
01:41:28,183 --> 01:41:29,741
Strong is your love for your brother.

861
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:31,780
This is our destiny.

862
01:41:32,788 --> 01:41:34,551
When were you last
reconciled with him?

863
01:41:34,957 --> 01:41:38,358
I never was. The
Metropolitan summoned us...

864
01:41:40,162 --> 01:41:42,630
...and made us kiss the cross
and swear to live in harmony.

865
01:41:42,698 --> 01:41:43,687
What are you saying?

866
01:41:43,766 --> 01:41:45,700
The Metropolitan
summoned us to kiss the cross.

867
01:41:45,768 --> 01:41:47,929
- When?
- Last winter.

868
01:42:42,691 --> 01:42:45,023
Vladimir is a beautiful town.

869
01:42:45,093 --> 01:42:46,219
Do you like it?

870
01:42:56,171 --> 01:42:57,570
Let's go.

871
01:43:41,850 --> 01:43:45,684
Forward! You dog,
stay close, or I'll kill you!

872
01:43:47,322 --> 01:43:50,723
Keep close to the
Prince! To the gates!

873
01:44:43,679 --> 01:44:45,408
Tatars!

874
01:44:46,181 --> 01:44:48,149
Run away!

875
01:45:55,817 --> 01:45:57,808
What is going on?

876
01:47:26,908 --> 01:47:29,240
The Grand Prince is coming.

877
01:47:40,489 --> 01:47:42,013
The brother has arrived.
