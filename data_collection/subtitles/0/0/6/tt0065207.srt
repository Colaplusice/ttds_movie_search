1
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:10,300
Resynched by ShooCat

2
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:41,600
All ready here, sir. We're standing by
and awaiting your word.

3
00:03:57,700 --> 00:03:59,400
Right. Over and out.

4
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:14,200
Our man was brought down
at 2:00 a.m. this morning.

5
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,400
SHAEF, in their all-knowing wisdom
didn't let us know until 10:00 a.m.

6
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:21,700
Damned idiots for not letting us know.

7
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,200
Double damned idiots
for ignoring our advice in the first place.

8
00:04:25,500 --> 00:04:28,100
Anyway, here he is...

9
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,600
in a town called Werfen...

10
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:34,100
at the Schloss Adler,
the Castle of the Eagles.

11
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:38,300
And believe me, it's well-named,
because only an eagle can get to it.

12
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,100
Our job is to get inside there
and get him out as soon as possible...

13
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:45,700
before they can
get the information from him.

14
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:48,000
How are you so sure that he's there, sir?

15
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,900
The Mosquito he was in
crash-landed only 10 miles away.

16
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:54,000
The Schloss Adler is the headquarters...

17
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:56,600
of the German Secret Service
in southern Bavaria.

18
00:04:56,700 --> 00:04:58,600
Where else would they take him?

19
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:02,500
-How did the plane crash, sir?
-Through the most damnable ill luck.

20
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:05,800
We carried out a saturation raid
on Nuremberg last night.

21
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:10,000
A German fighter shouldn't have been
within 100 miles of the Austrian border.

22
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,900
A wandering
Messerschmitt patrol got him.

23
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,100
Anyway, that's not important.

24
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:19,200
What is important is that we get him out
before he talks...

25
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,600
or I should say, you get him out.

26
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:25,900
What about paratroops, sir?

27
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:30,200
The Schloss Adler
is inaccessible and impregnable.

28
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:33,600
It would require a battalion
of paratroops to take it.

29
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,200
We haven't got the time.

30
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,300
Stealth and secrecy are our only hope...

31
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:41,900
and you gentlemen are,
I trust, stealthy and secretive.

32
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:46,000
We realize that you've never
worked together before as a team...

33
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,600
but you're familiar with one another,
except for Lt. Schaffer here.

34
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,200
You've probably noticed
that Lt. Schaffer...

35
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:56,500
wears the shoulder flashes
of the American Ranger division.

36
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,500
I think that speaks for itself.

37
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,400
Maj. Smith will lead the group in.

38
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:04,700
You're all expert
at survival behind enemy lines...

39
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:06,800
Smith, Lt. Schaffer...

40
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:10,100
Sgts. Harrod and MacPherson
in their military capacities...

41
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,600
the rest of you in other duties.

42
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:15,300
You all speak fluent German.

43
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,400
You've been trained
in different types of combat.

44
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:22,500
If anybody has a chance
of getting him out, you have.

45
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,000
There is, of course, another way, sir.

46
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,800
A way with a 1 00-percent guarantee
of success.

47
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,000
Neither Adm. Rolland or I claim
to be omniscient or infallible.

48
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,000
Is there an alternative that we've missed?

49
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:39,800
Whistle up a Pathfinder squadron
of Lancasters with 10-ton bombs.

50
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:44,300
I don't think anybody in that castle
would ever talk again.

51
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,600
Nor do I think that you grasp
the realities of the situation.

52
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:50,800
The captured man, Gen. Carnaby,
is an American.

53
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:54,200
If we were to destroy him,
then I think Gen. Eisenhower...

54
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:57,900
might launch his second front against us
rather than against the Germans.

55
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:02,700
There are certain niceties to be observed
in our relationship with our allies.

56
00:07:04,700 --> 00:07:08,300
Very well, then, gentlemen.
10:00 p.m. tonight at the airfield.

57
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:12,300
-No more questions, I take it?
-Yes, sir.

58
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,300
Begging the Colonel's pardon, sir.
What's all this about?

59
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:19,200
I mean, why is this man
so damned important?

60
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:20,900
-Why--
-That'll do, Sergeant.

61
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,100
You have all the information you require.

62
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:26,100
I think if we're sending a man
to what may be his death...

63
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,300
he has a right to know why.

64
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,900
It's painfully simple, Sergeant.

65
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:34,700
Gen. Carnaby is one
of the overall coordinators...

66
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,700
of planning for the second front.

67
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:41,400
He set out last night to meet
his opposite numbers in the Middle East...

68
00:07:41,500 --> 00:07:44,400
to finalize the plans
for the invasion of Europe.

69
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:48,000
The rendezvous with the Russians
was to have been in Crete.

70
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,500
Unfortunately, his plane
didn't get through.

71
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,200
If the Germans can make him talk...

72
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,800
it could mean no second front this year.

73
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:02,200
-You understand, Sergeant?
-Yes, sir.

74
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:07,000
-I'm sorry, sir.
-That's all right, Sergeant. Forget it.

75
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:10,800
Now, if you have any more questions,
Maj. Smith will answer them.

76
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,400
That's all, gentlemen.

77
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,700
Get them ready.
We're approaching the drop area.

78
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,300
Stand by!

79
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Green on! Go!

80
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,300
Where's Harrod?

81
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:46,400
Well, last time I saw him, he was drifting
towards those trees over here.

82
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:54,100
All right. Spread out.

83
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,700
Let's go and find him.

84
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:26,800
Major!

85
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:15,000
-His neck's broken.
-Damn it.

86
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:23,600
What do we do now?
Do we bury him, or do we leave him here?

87
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,000
We leave him here.

88
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:27,300
The snow will cover him
in a couple of hours.

89
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:31,500
Get back and pick up the equipment.
I want to see if the radio's still working.

90
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,400
The radio works all right. There's a barn
about a mile down the valley.

91
00:15:18,400 --> 00:15:20,400
We'll use it to check our equipment.

92
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:23,300
-What about the people who live in it?
-There aren't any.

93
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,600
This is a high alpine pasture.

94
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:29,300
They bring the cattle up in May
and take them down in September.

95
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:32,200
The rest of the time,
the place is totally deserted.

96
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,000
Come on. Let's go.

97
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:11,600
Somehow, you know, this just isn't me.

98
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,700
It's not any of us, Jock.

99
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:15,500
You're the cook. Cook...

100
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:20,900
some hot food and some hot coffee,
and then call London on the radio.

101
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:24,100
Damn it. I left that codebook
in Sgt. Harrod's tunic.

102
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:28,100
-I'll go and get it for you.
-No. It's all right. It's my stupid fault.

103
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,700
Sounds as if it's still blowing a blizzard.

104
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:34,600
If I'm not back in an hour...

105
00:16:34,900 --> 00:16:37,800
signal me with a flare pistol
four times every five minutes.

106
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:39,600
That should bring a blind man home.

107
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:42,200
Might also bring the best part
of a German regiment.

108
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,700
There's not a German within five miles.

109
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,200
Nobody leaves here until I come back.

110
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:51,100
-Jock, save me some coffee.
-lt'll be cold by then.

111
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,500
They say that's an advantage.
You can't taste cold coffee.

112
00:18:15,700 --> 00:18:16,800
Halt.

113
00:18:17,900 --> 00:18:19,200
Turn around.

114
00:18:27,800 --> 00:18:30,400
You took your time getting here,
didn't you?

115
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:32,700
Things to attend to.

116
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,300
Enjoy your trip?

117
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:38,100
Lovely. I nearly froze to death
in that damn plane.

118
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,500
Why didn't you supply some hot water
bottles or an electrically heated suit?

119
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,100
-I thought you loved me.
-I can't help what you think.

120
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:49,000
You managed to bring your gear.

121
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,400
Is that the greeting I'm going to get?

122
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:55,900
I'm afraid so, for the time being.
My radio operator was killed in the drop.

123
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:57,500
What happened?

124
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:00,100
Something struck him in the neck.

125
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,500
Either the haft of a knife
or the butt of a gun.

126
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,700
The skin was unbroken, but discolored.

127
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:06,900
It means someone
broke his neck just after...

128
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,800
to make it look like an accident.

129
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:12,800
Now listen, I'm taking the group at dawn
over the ridge into the next valley.

130
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,100
We'll stop in the woods until about 7:00.
Don't stumble into us.

131
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,800
As soon it's dark,
we'll move into the village of Werfen.

132
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:23,100
In the village, there's a gasthaus
called Zum Vinden Hirsch.

133
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:25,900
Behind it and to the right,
there's a woodshed.

134
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,300
I'll meet you there
at exactly 8:00 tomorrow night.

135
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,900
-After that, what?
-I'll let you know when the time comes.

136
00:19:35,700 --> 00:19:38,600
-I see you've come fully prepared.
-Never mind about that.

137
00:19:38,700 --> 00:19:42,400
How do you know about all these things,
Zum Vinden Hirsch and the shed?

138
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:46,800
I'm entitled to know.

139
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,200
You're entitled to know nothing.

140
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:54,400
We've worked together for three years.
I'm a professional.

141
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,400
So am l.

142
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:58,500
If I were the marrying kind, which I'm--

143
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,100
-I thought you were in a hurry.
-So I am.

144
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:10,500
Aren't you?

145
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:19,800
What kept you?

146
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:22,600
I was very lucky.

147
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:25,300
I ran into this fabulous blonde.

148
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,800
She was lying in a snowdrift.

149
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,600
Does she have a friend?

150
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:31,800
I'm afraid you're out of luck.

151
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,200
-Thanks for waiting up for me, anyway.
-No problem.

152
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:52,300
Lieutenant, why don't you go to sleep?

153
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,800
It'll be dawn in a couple of hours.
You, too, Jock.

154
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,400
Yeah. I'll do that.

155
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,700
Can't get a thing.

156
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,000
Probably the storm?

157
00:22:13,700 --> 00:22:15,900
Yeah, we'll try again in the morning.

158
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:56,200
Lieutenant, come with me.
The rest of you stay here.

159
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:14,800
Better leave the equipment here.

160
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:46,100
Somebody's got to be crazy.

161
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:49,600
How'd your Colonel
expect anyone to get in there?

162
00:23:49,700 --> 00:23:52,200
He feels if he can penetrate
the German High Command...

163
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,500
we shouldn't have any difficulty
getting up there.

164
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:56,000
He did what?

165
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:59,900
He spent the years '40 to '43
in Germany, first in the Wehrmacht...

166
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:03,000
and then finally
in General Headquarters in Berlin.

167
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,300
They say he knew Hitler quite well.

168
00:24:05,500 --> 00:24:08,300
-I thought he looked a little nuts.
-Yeah, probably is.

169
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,500
Now, we've got problems of our own.
Get the boys into the trees.

170
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:15,000
We've brought them too far over.
Be sure they go beyond that tree line.

171
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:17,400
-What about you?
-I'll be along in a minute.

172
00:24:17,500 --> 00:24:20,200
-Be sure they stay behind the trees.
-All right.

173
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,800
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.

174
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,100
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Father Machree is waiting.

175
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:34,200
This is Father Machree, Broadsword.

176
00:25:34,300 --> 00:25:36,800
What is your present position,
please? Over.

177
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:42,200
Woods due west of castle.
Descending at dusk. Harrod dead.

178
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:43,700
Over.

179
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:48,400
Was Harrod killed accidentally? Over.

180
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,600
No. Over.

181
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,500
-By the Germans? Over.
-No.

182
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:59,000
Time of next broadcast uncertain.
Will you stand by?

183
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,100
Col. Turner and I will remain
at headquarters till operation completed.

184
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,700
Good luck. Out.

185
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,200
It looks as though you're right, sir.

186
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,900
Yes, I'm afraid so.

187
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:25,600
Who's next, I wonder?

188
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:29,100
-Smith himself, perhaps.
-I doubt that.

189
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:32,500
Some people have a sixth sense.

190
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:35,800
He has a sixth, a seventh, and an eighth.

191
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,700
-He's our best agent.
-Except yourself.

192
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:45,500
Still and all, even if he is the best,
this operation looks impossible now.

193
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,000
Take a look down there,
at the foot of the castle.

194
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:34,300
Dobermans.

195
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Dobermans, a guard tower,
and a wire fence.

196
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,800
Fences can be cut or climbed, Lieutenant.

197
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:46,800
I doubt if that one can be climbed. It's got
around 3,000 volts running through it.

198
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:50,800
If I'm not mistaken, Major,
that's an army barracks over there.

199
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:57,100
No mistake. This is the headquarters
of the Wehrmacht Alpenkorps.

200
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:00,700
Swell. If you got any other surprises,
I think I ought to know about them.

201
00:28:00,700 --> 00:28:02,500
I thought you knew, Lieutenant.

202
00:28:02,600 --> 00:28:05,200
Why do you think
we're not dressed as German sailors?

203
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:07,400
Training troops come and go all the time.

204
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,000
What are six new faces
among 600 new faces?

205
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:13,400
Look, Major,
this is primarily a British operation.

206
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:16,300
I'm an American.
I don't even know why the hell I'm here.

207
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:19,300
Lieutenant, you're here
because you're an American.

208
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:45,300
Dear Kramer, you have turned
a little gray since I saw you last.

209
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,100
I'm afraid so, sir.

210
00:29:47,800 --> 00:29:50,100
-How is Berlin, sir?
-Things have changed.

211
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:51,600
You like my machine?

212
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:54,400
-lt looks pretty dangerous.
-You must try it.

213
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,700
Maj. Bacola, my adjutant.

214
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,200
Maj. Brant, Jaeger battalion.

215
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,800
Col. Weissner, Field Security.

216
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,900
Maj. Von Hapen, Gestapo.

217
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
-Have you questioned him yet?
-No. I was waiting for you.

218
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:22,300
That Maj. Von Hapen,
does he know Gen. Carnaby's here?

219
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:26,300
Yes. I did inform him of his arrival,
but not of his importance.

220
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Good. If possible, I'd prefer the Gestapo
to be kept out of this matter...

221
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:32,600
-until we have the information we want.
-Fine.

222
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:35,600
We don't need them cluttering up things
with torture chambers.

223
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,500
This can remain a strictly army matter
for the time being.

224
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:40,100
-I agree.
-Good.

225
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:44,200
I've had a very tiring trip down here
from Berlin. I'd like to freshen up a bit.

226
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:47,000
Perhaps sleep a few hours
before meeting Gen. Carnaby.

227
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:49,500
-I'll see you to your quarters.
-Thank you.

228
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:52,100
The meeting will be ready
whenever you wish.

229
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:17,500
Halt. Show me your papers.

230
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:27,200
Right.

231
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:30,300
I've written many times, of course, but...

232
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,200
with so many troops on leave in Berlin,
it's hardly likely she'd remember me.

233
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:38,300
But one always hopes
you're the one she'll never forget.

234
00:34:38,300 --> 00:34:41,100
What was her name, anyway?

235
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,200
Yeah, I remember Fred.
She was a short little redhead.

236
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,300
We'll try this one behind us.

237
00:35:24,600 --> 00:35:26,800
When you get inside, circulate around.

238
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,900
Keep your ears open for anything
about Gen. Carnaby.

239
00:35:30,700 --> 00:35:33,600
We meet back here
in half an hour. All right.

240
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:23,000
Two beers.

241
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,600
See you later.

242
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,800
Anything else needed here?

243
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,300
And who might you be,
my pretty alpine rose?

244
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:08,200
-Heidi. Stop, Major. I've got work to do.
-There's no more important work...

245
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:10,400
than entertaining
the soldiers of the fatherland.

246
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:13,300
-Shall I sing you a song?
-I hear too much singing.

247
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:16,700
Very well, then. I'll whistle.
It goes like this....

248
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,300
I bet you have
a beautiful singing voice, too.

249
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:26,100
Thank you.

250
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:28,900
Be in the woodshed in five minutes.

251
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:32,900
Now slap me across the face
as hard as you can.

252
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:43,400
Your conduct does not become
an officer of the Wehrmacht.

253
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:46,600
Herr Major, when you talk to me.

254
00:37:46,900 --> 00:37:50,400
Maj. Bernd Himmler.
Does the name mean anything to you?

255
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:55,000
I advise you to mind
your own business in future.

256
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,100
Is that understood?

257
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,000
-Cognac.
-Make that two.

258
00:38:15,000 --> 00:38:18,400
I don't suppose you found out anything
about Gen. Carnaby.

259
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,600
I didn't get around to that. Thank you.

260
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,400
What were you and that Major
talking about?

261
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,900
I told him I was Himmler's brother.

262
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:30,300
I could see
why that would shake him up a little.

263
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:32,400
More than a little, I should think.

264
00:38:32,500 --> 00:38:34,600
Keep an eye on things. I'll be back.

265
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:42,800
Take your clothes off.

266
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,600
-But l--
-Don't argue. Take your clothes off.

267
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:50,500
All right.

268
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:56,000
Now, relax. I didn't mean it that way.

269
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:02,200
You're going up to the castle tonight
as a domestic.

270
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,700
How? Naked?

271
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,300
Not a bad idea, but it's a bit obvious.

272
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:12,600
There's a staff shortage in Germany
and the Schloss Adler is no exception.

273
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:18,400
You're the type they're looking for,
young, intelligent, good-looking...

274
00:40:18,500 --> 00:40:20,800
and as we both know,
not entirely without humor.

275
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:22,400
You must be mad.

276
00:40:22,500 --> 00:40:25,100
If I wasn't, what would I be doing
in this job?

277
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:27,000
Listen very carefully.

278
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,600
You're supposed to arrive on a bus
from Steingaden in about 20 minutes.

279
00:40:30,700 --> 00:40:33,700
Your name is Maria Schenk.
You come from the Rhineland.

280
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:35,600
Give me that boot.

281
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,600
You've had TB and were forced
to give up your job.

282
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,700
You have a cousin called Heidi
who works in Zum Vinden Hirsch.

283
00:40:41,700 --> 00:40:43,900
It's because of her that you got the job.

284
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,000
-Where are my identity papers?
-ln that case...

285
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:50,200
with your travel permit.
Heidi will give you the rest later.

286
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:53,000
It must have taken time
to prepare these things.

287
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:56,800
Very likely. Our forgery department
did a special job on your papers.

288
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:02,200
But I thought Gen. Carnaby's
plane crashed only yesterday morning.

289
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,500
It was carefully arranged.

290
00:41:04,600 --> 00:41:07,600
The plane was crash-landed
in Oberhausen military airfield...

291
00:41:07,600 --> 00:41:09,200
about five miles from here.

292
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:12,800
It was riddled with machine-gun holes,
British machine-gun holes.

293
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,300
But what the hell?
A hole is a hole, as they say.

294
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:20,200
Are you trying to say that you'd risk
the life of an American general...

295
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,300
-and all the plans for the second front?
-Of course not.

296
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:26,800
Give me the other boot.

297
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:29,300
I'm in a hurry to get to the castle...

298
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:32,200
before they find out
they haven't got Gen. Carnaby.

299
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:35,000
The chap they have
knows no more about the second front...

300
00:41:35,100 --> 00:41:37,300
than I know
about the back end of the moon.

301
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,500
He's an American corporal.

302
00:41:39,900 --> 00:41:41,600
His name is Cartwright Jones.

303
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:44,000
He's an ex-actor, probably second-rate...

304
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:46,500
but he's the dead spitting image
of the General.

305
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:49,700
Did you talk this poor man
into getting involved with all this?

306
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:52,800
I didn't have to. He volunteered.
What actor wouldn't?

307
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:58,300
If he pulls this off, it'll be
the summit of his professional career.

308
00:41:58,900 --> 00:42:01,400
Mind you, it might be a short engagement.

309
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,900
Yes. A one-night stand.

310
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,300
Here we are.

311
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:25,600
Mary, now Maria, this is your cousin Heidi.

312
00:42:25,700 --> 00:42:27,900
Leave this behind in case you're searched.

313
00:42:27,900 --> 00:42:29,800
Heidi will tell you what to do.

314
00:42:29,900 --> 00:42:33,500
She's been one of our top agents
in Bavaria since 1941 and....

315
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
What a disguise.

316
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:26,900
He left three minutes after me...

317
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:30,100
in a hurry, you say, so he wasn't after me.

318
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:33,500
Any of the others leave?

319
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,300
Not that I could see,
but this place is so crowded...

320
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,100
and there are several other exits.

321
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:41,000
Any one of them could have slipped out.

322
00:43:42,600 --> 00:43:46,600
You better start playing it straight
or you can deal me out of this mess.

323
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
Now, we both know that radio operator
wasn't killed in any drop.

324
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,000
With MacPherson dead,
there's only five of us left.

325
00:43:55,000 --> 00:43:58,500
You either let me know what's going on,
or there's only going to be four.

326
00:43:58,600 --> 00:44:00,300
All right, Lieutenant.

327
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:04,200
This morning you asked me why you,
an American, was on this mission.

328
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:07,300
The answer is really very simple.

329
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:19,000
Oh, my dear Maria, you came after all.

330
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:22,500
My dear cousin Heidi, how wonderful
to see you after all these years.

331
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,200
Gestapo. I am so happy to see you.

332
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,900
May I introduce you to a friend of mine?
Maj. Von Hapen.

333
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,000
My cousin Maria Schenk.

334
00:44:33,800 --> 00:44:37,900
Your cousin told us to expect you,
Frulein Schenk, but, Heidi...

335
00:44:38,200 --> 00:44:40,700
you did not tell me
she was as beautiful as this.

336
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:42,200
Thank you.

337
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:46,200
Perhaps when you're ready
to take the cable car to the castle...

338
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:48,500
-I'll have the honor to escort you.
-Thank you.

339
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:50,600
And I am going with her.

340
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,300
Both of you? Then, I am very fortunate.

341
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,900
Frulein, until a little bit later.

342
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,800
This is a map of the castle.

343
00:45:27,700 --> 00:45:29,100
And your instructions.

344
00:45:29,600 --> 00:45:31,000
Do your homework well.

345
00:45:47,900 --> 00:45:49,900
He doesn't seem to be anywhere in here.

346
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:53,600
Wonder where the devil he's got to.
I gave orders that nobody should leave.

347
00:45:53,700 --> 00:45:55,600
Shall I go outside and take a look?

348
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:14,700
Attention!

349
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:18,800
We are looking for four or five
Alpenkorps deserters from Stuttgart.

350
00:46:18,900 --> 00:46:21,800
To escape, they killed two officers
and a guardroom sergeant.

351
00:46:21,900 --> 00:46:24,100
They were last known
to be heading this way.

352
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:26,300
Clever. Very clever, indeed.

353
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:31,000
I want the senior officers of drafts 13,
14, and 15 to come forward at once.

354
00:46:33,400 --> 00:46:34,800
Check their papers.

355
00:46:36,200 --> 00:46:38,600
Gentlemen, any suggestions?

356
00:46:44,100 --> 00:46:45,500
Lieutenant?

357
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:50,500
I think we'll stand a lot better chance
outside than we will in here.

358
00:46:51,300 --> 00:46:52,400
Agreed.

359
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:56,000
Gentlemen, see you after the war.

360
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,600
These papers are from the Fourth Panzer
division stationed in Stuttgart.

361
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:09,400
When were they issued to him?

362
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,800
-Colonel.
-What is it, Major?

363
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:16,500
Myself and the others are the ones you're
looking for. We've come to surrender.

364
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,300
Lieutenant, take the three men away
for questioning.

365
00:47:19,400 --> 00:47:21,700
The officers will come with me.

366
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:33,800
Excuse me.

367
00:48:04,400 --> 00:48:06,400
-Yes.
-Maj. Von Hapen.

368
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,400
Yes, sir.

369
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:21,700
Frulein.

370
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,900
-Halt.
-It's just my shoelaces.

371
00:50:35,300 --> 00:50:37,500
-We better get rid of this thing.
-Yeah.

372
00:50:38,100 --> 00:50:40,000
Over the cliff. Let's push.

373
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:02,700
Okay. Push.

374
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:14,200
And a little more.

375
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,200
Good evening, Lieutenant.

376
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,000
This is Miss Schenk. Lt. Kernitser.

377
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:46,700
She is the Colonel's secretary
in charge of all the female staff.

378
00:51:46,800 --> 00:51:50,100
Can I see your papers, please?
And yours, Frulein.

379
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,500
Would you come with me, please?

380
00:52:02,700 --> 00:52:05,600
-Perhaps I'll see you a little later.
-Thank you.

381
00:52:27,300 --> 00:52:29,400
Do you find anything interesting, Major?

382
00:52:34,100 --> 00:52:37,200
I hear there was some excitement
in the village tonight.

383
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:39,700
Nothing very serious.

384
00:52:39,700 --> 00:52:42,600
Just the arrest of five army deserters.
That's all.

385
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,000
Not quite. Those were the orders
that were put out.

386
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,000
But, actually, they were five British agents
dressed in German uniforms.

387
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:53,100
British agents? Why wasn't I informed?

388
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:56,100
I'm informing you now, Major.

389
00:52:57,300 --> 00:52:59,600
If you sent out the orders, Colonel...

390
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,300
then you must have known
for some time...

391
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:06,200
who they were
and that they were in this district.

392
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:09,300
We called you in your office
and in your rooms.

393
00:53:09,800 --> 00:53:11,500
You were not there.

394
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:14,600
Colonel, I don't have to remind you, do l...

395
00:53:15,600 --> 00:53:18,800
that I am in charge of all
the Gestapo activities in this area...

396
00:53:18,900 --> 00:53:22,400
and if there are foreign agents
then I am to be informed at once!

397
00:53:22,700 --> 00:53:26,100
-You were not here, Major.
-Then you find me, Colonel.

398
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:30,100
My duty is to inform you, but not
to search every gasthaus to locate you.

399
00:53:30,200 --> 00:53:31,900
I know your duties.

400
00:53:33,300 --> 00:53:35,000
And your loyalties.

401
00:53:35,800 --> 00:53:39,300
Let me remind you, Major,
that I'm a colonel in the SS...

402
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:42,300
and not a lieutenant
whom you can frighten with your threats!

403
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:46,200
Your military rank and position
are obvious to me, Colonel...

404
00:53:47,600 --> 00:53:51,600
and so are your attempts to discredit me
with my superiors in Berlin.

405
00:53:51,600 --> 00:53:55,500
If there is any discredit,
you bring it upon yourself.

406
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,200
Good night.

407
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,600
-You better lock the door.
-Sure.

408
00:54:10,700 --> 00:54:12,900
Here are all the things you'll need.

409
00:54:15,500 --> 00:54:19,600
Automatic, field glasses,
ball of string, and lead weight.

410
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,400
-You put those things there?
-A week ago.

411
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,600
-You knew all about this even then?
-Yeah. Good luck, cousin.

412
00:54:36,400 --> 00:54:38,100
We may need these.

413
00:54:38,600 --> 00:54:43,200
I guess it's occurred to you, the Germans
probably know about all this stuff by now.

414
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:45,100
It did cross my mind.

415
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,000
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

416
00:54:56,800 --> 00:54:57,700
Over.

417
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:03,300
Broadsword calling Danny Boy. Over.

418
00:55:05,900 --> 00:55:07,400
Broadsword, sir.

419
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,800
Danny Boy calling Broadsword.
Come in, Broadsword. Over.

420
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:16,200
MacPherson murdered. Thomas,
Christiansen, and Berkley captured.

421
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:18,400
I'm effecting entrance within the hour.

422
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:20,900
Please have transport standing by. Over.

423
00:55:21,400 --> 00:55:24,200
Pull out now, Broadsword.
Save yourselves. Over.

424
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:27,100
You must be joking. Over and out.

425
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,700
That is an order, Broadsword. Over.

426
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:41,100
He's gone, sir.

427
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:43,600
Damn it!

428
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:46,000
It's all my fault.

429
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,600
It's all our fault, Colonel.

430
00:55:49,300 --> 00:55:50,600
It was my idea.

431
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,400
Maybe I'm getting too old.

432
00:55:54,800 --> 00:55:56,600
Maybe we're both too old.

433
00:55:58,200 --> 00:56:01,000
Anyway, there can't be
any doubt anymore.

434
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,900
The Germans have totally penetrated Ml6.

435
00:56:05,600 --> 00:56:08,200
They know every move we make
almost before we make it.

436
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,500
Where the hell are they getting it all from?

437
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:12,900
We handpicked every man
for this mission.

438
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,300
-We have top security.
-Security?

439
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:19,700
That word has become a bloody joke.

440
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,100
We've got company.

441
00:56:58,900 --> 00:57:01,300
-Open the window.
-All right.

442
01:03:04,000 --> 01:03:07,700
Put the bag in the bus,
and see if you can start the engine.

443
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:49,300
-How's it going?
-Try to give it a start.

444
01:03:49,400 --> 01:03:50,500
Right.

445
01:05:22,500 --> 01:05:25,000
Yes. Capt. Mueller, with three prisoners.

446
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:26,700
All right.

447
01:12:20,000 --> 01:12:23,800
Leave this one behind
and tie that one to the end of the rope.

448
01:13:27,700 --> 01:13:29,700
Good God, that nearly killed me.

449
01:13:29,900 --> 01:13:32,500
You shouldn't go
on these insane missions.

450
01:13:32,700 --> 01:13:34,200
You're getting too old.

451
01:13:34,300 --> 01:13:37,200
I thank you for those few kind words.

452
01:13:39,000 --> 01:13:43,000
The first time I've been hot
since I was in this bloody country.

453
01:13:44,500 --> 01:13:46,700
-You got a plan of the castle?
-Yes.

454
01:13:46,800 --> 01:13:48,600
Fetch it for me, would you?

455
01:14:10,500 --> 01:14:12,700
Why don't you give him a hand?

456
01:14:13,400 --> 01:14:16,900
What for? He's perfectly capable
of looking after himself.

457
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:19,600
If I could climb up on my own,
why can't he?

458
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:28,100
First left down the stairs, third door.

459
01:14:28,200 --> 01:14:30,600
Next right-hander takes us
into the east wing.

460
01:14:30,700 --> 01:14:32,600
Down again. Second left.

461
01:14:33,900 --> 01:14:35,600
Telephone exchange.

462
01:14:41,900 --> 01:14:44,900
You wouldn't mind giving me a hand,
would you?

463
01:14:53,000 --> 01:14:57,000
You seem to have a lot of women
stashed around this country, Major.

464
01:14:57,100 --> 01:14:59,500
I'm sorry. This is Mary.
She's one of our group.

465
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:01,800
-Lt. Schaffer.
-Hello.

466
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:04,800
Hello, Mary.

1
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:46,500
Take the rope and the explosives
to your room...

2
01:15:46,600 --> 01:15:48,700
and bring them with you when you come.

3
01:16:28,600 --> 01:16:31,500
-How's it looking?
-It's quiet enough.

4
01:16:33,500 --> 01:16:36,000
The first thing we must do
is cripple that helicopter.

5
01:16:36,100 --> 01:16:38,200
They might try to fly Carnaby out in it.

6
01:16:38,300 --> 01:16:40,300
I think we can handle that.

7
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:11,900
Hello?

8
01:17:37,200 --> 01:17:39,500
-You the pilot?
-Yes, sir.

9
01:17:39,600 --> 01:17:41,700
Kommandant wants you on the phone.

10
01:17:41,900 --> 01:17:45,000
It's in the radio office on the left,
around the corner.

11
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:49,300
-Do you have a cigarette, Lieutenant?
-Yes, sir. Of course.

12
01:17:51,400 --> 01:17:53,600
-Rather cold, isn't it?
-Yes, sir.

13
01:18:31,300 --> 01:18:32,800
That was quick.

14
01:18:33,200 --> 01:18:35,700
Fear lent them wings, as the saying goes.

15
01:18:35,800 --> 01:18:36,900
What do we do now?

16
01:18:37,000 --> 01:18:40,400
I think we'd better see
how Cartwright Jones is getting along.

17
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:16,300
You are making things
very difficult, Herr General.

18
01:19:16,500 --> 01:19:20,200
-Very difficult, indeed.
-There aren't any difficulties, Major.

19
01:19:20,500 --> 01:19:24,200
Gen. Rosemeyer hasn't
forgotten that Germany's a signatory...

20
01:19:24,300 --> 01:19:26,100
to the Hague Convention.

21
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:29,300
I have not forgotten,
but my hands are tied.

22
01:19:29,500 --> 01:19:31,400
I have my orders from Berlin.

23
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:34,300
You can tell Berlin
all they're entitled to know.

24
01:19:34,300 --> 01:19:39,200
I'm Gen. George Carnaby,
United States Army, RA 123-025-3964.

25
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:43,600
And one of the chief coordinators
of planning for the second front.

26
01:19:45,000 --> 01:19:47,100
Which second front is that?

27
01:19:48,100 --> 01:19:50,100
General, I have done all I can.

28
01:19:51,200 --> 01:19:53,500
I have tried to hold up the Gestapo.

29
01:19:54,300 --> 01:19:57,600
I've persuaded the High Command
that the mere fact of your capture...

30
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:00,400
will compel the Allies to alter their plans...

31
01:20:01,700 --> 01:20:03,800
but this, it seems, is not enough.

32
01:20:04,500 --> 01:20:08,000
For the last time, may I request you
to give us the information?

33
01:20:08,100 --> 01:20:11,600
Gen. George Carnaby,
United States Army.

34
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,600
The matter is in your hands, Kramer.

35
01:20:19,300 --> 01:20:22,400
You know, General,
we have drugs that will make you talk.

36
01:20:22,600 --> 01:20:25,300
-We do not wish to use them, but--
-Scopolamine.

37
01:20:26,500 --> 01:20:28,500
Where's that going to get you, Colonel?

38
01:20:28,600 --> 01:20:30,300
There are other drugs, too.

39
01:20:30,900 --> 01:20:33,800
The Lieutenant, here, is a trained nurse.

40
01:20:36,500 --> 01:20:37,700
Excuse me.
1
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,500
Yes, you can bring them up now.

2
01:20:43,600 --> 01:20:46,700
Has there been any further information
about the other two?

3
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,000
Keep me advised.

4
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,500
Some very interesting company
coming up, General.

5
01:20:58,700 --> 01:21:00,600
The drugs may not be necessary.

6
01:21:04,000 --> 01:21:06,500
Don't you think it's time we make a move?

7
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,400
Any minute now.

8
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:11,300
Just be patient.

9
01:21:41,300 --> 01:21:42,400
A moment.

10
01:21:54,200 --> 01:21:55,200
Frulein.

11
01:21:56,900 --> 01:21:58,700
Did I disturb you?

12
01:21:58,800 --> 01:22:01,800
-No. I was just going out.
-Then, I am just in time.

13
01:22:02,100 --> 01:22:05,100
-You wanted to see me, Major?
-Naturally.

14
01:22:06,100 --> 01:22:07,400
What about?

15
01:22:10,100 --> 01:22:11,200
Well, nothing.

16
01:22:11,200 --> 01:22:15,600
I just wanted to see you.
Now, that is not a crime, is it?

17
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:20,000
It's very seldom
we have so pretty a girl here.

18
01:22:21,100 --> 01:22:25,000
Perhaps I can show you
a little Bavarian hospitality.

19
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,300
Now, downstairs,
we have an armaments room...

20
01:22:28,400 --> 01:22:31,500
which has been converted
into the most marvelous cafe.

21
01:22:32,000 --> 01:22:34,900
But my duties,
I have to see the Colonel's secretary.

22
01:22:35,100 --> 01:22:37,600
The Colonel's secretary
can wait a little while.

23
01:22:37,600 --> 01:22:39,800
You and me, we have a lot to talk about.

24
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:42,200
-Such as?
-Dusseldorf.

25
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:49,600
I was a student there for many years
from 1929 to 1933.

26
01:22:50,300 --> 01:22:52,300
To your health, gentlemen.

27
01:22:57,100 --> 01:22:59,000
You are not drinking, General.

28
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:02,700
That's understandable.

29
01:23:03,000 --> 01:23:06,800
When your rescuers turn out to be
birds of a different feather....

30
01:23:09,000 --> 01:23:11,000
And the return trip, gentlemen.

31
01:23:11,200 --> 01:23:13,300
How was that to be accomplished?

32
01:23:13,400 --> 01:23:15,100
Through Switzerland.

33
01:23:15,300 --> 01:23:18,200
Then it should be quite easy
for you to return to London.

34
01:23:18,300 --> 01:23:21,300
A rubber dinghy across the Rhine,
and then a short walk.

35
01:23:21,400 --> 01:23:22,700
You'll be in Whitehall...

36
01:23:22,700 --> 01:23:26,000
reporting Gen. Carnaby's
transfer to Berlin before you know it.

37
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:30,100
Back to London? Are you mad?
Not with Smith and Schaffer still alive.

38
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:33,300
What do you take us for?

39
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,900
You will also, of course, be reporting
the unfortunate demise of Maj. Smith.

40
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:42,200
-ls he dead?
-We are not quite sure.

41
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,600
-lt is being looked into right now.
-It's getting late.

42
01:23:45,700 --> 01:23:48,600
-Please remember the important issue.
-Yes, sir.

43
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,900
I think the situation
has changed sufficiently...

44
01:23:53,000 --> 01:23:56,100
for you to give us the information
we have been asking for.

45
01:23:56,200 --> 01:23:58,000
Nothing's changed, Colonel.

46
01:24:00,000 --> 01:24:01,700
Most unfortunate.

47
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:33,300
Just a waste of good scopolamine.
Don't move, any of you.

48
01:24:36,100 --> 01:24:38,500
No, I'd advise you not to, Colonel.

49
01:24:41,800 --> 01:24:45,000
I'm glad to see you all here,
safe and sound, enjoying a drink.

50
01:24:45,100 --> 01:24:47,100
I'm sorry to interrupt you.

51
01:24:48,300 --> 01:24:50,300
Lieutenant, drop that gun.

52
01:24:51,300 --> 01:24:53,800
-What?
-Drop that gun and sit down.

53
01:24:57,400 --> 01:25:00,300
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Sit down!

54
01:25:09,800 --> 01:25:12,800
-Major, if I live to be 100--
-Do nothing, Lieutenant.

55
01:25:16,700 --> 01:25:19,200
In your own idiom, you're a punk...

56
01:25:20,100 --> 01:25:22,400
and a pretty second-rate punk at that.

57
01:25:22,800 --> 01:25:27,400
-lf I might have some explanation.
-ln good time, Colonel. All in good time.

58
01:25:28,300 --> 01:25:32,000
I was about to say scopolamine would
have little effect on our friend...

59
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:35,800
except to prove he's not Gen. Carnaby
but a certain Cartwright Jones...

60
01:25:35,900 --> 01:25:38,300
an American actor
impersonating Gen. Carnaby.

61
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,200
-Who are you?
-Just a passerby, as you might say.

62
01:25:41,500 --> 01:25:44,500
In fact, I think the drug
would probably work better...

63
01:25:44,500 --> 01:25:47,600
on our friends at the end of the table.
They're our real enemies.

64
01:25:47,700 --> 01:25:50,900
-Don't listen to him, General. It's a bluff!
-Keep quiet!

65
01:25:53,900 --> 01:25:57,600
Allow me to introduce myself.
Maj. Johann Schmidt.

66
01:25:57,800 --> 01:26:00,500
SS Military lntelligence, Stuttgart.

67
01:26:00,900 --> 01:26:03,100
-Can you prove that?
-Certainly, Colonel.

68
01:26:03,200 --> 01:26:06,700
Before I do, I wonder if you'd be
good enough to call one of your guards.

69
01:26:06,800 --> 01:26:10,800
I don't fancy talking and keeping my eye
on these people at the same time.

70
01:26:13,700 --> 01:26:15,000
Strange.

71
01:26:17,600 --> 01:26:19,400
I seem to remember...

72
01:26:20,300 --> 01:26:23,400
that the cathedral
was on the other side of the square.

73
01:26:29,500 --> 01:26:32,600
Of course, I might be mistaken.
It's been a long time.

74
01:26:33,900 --> 01:26:36,200
No, Major. I could have made a mistake.

75
01:26:37,200 --> 01:26:39,800
I haven't been to Dusseldorf
for three years.

76
01:26:41,300 --> 01:26:43,000
It's very easy to forget.

77
01:26:43,100 --> 01:26:45,000
Yes. It's very easy.

78
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:53,500
Frulein, you seem to be
a little bit distracted.

79
01:26:55,100 --> 01:26:57,600
-ls anything wrong?
-No, it's nothing.

80
01:26:57,700 --> 01:27:01,500
Just a slight headache.
I've had a long day traveling.

81
01:27:02,500 --> 01:27:04,900
Yes, of course. And here I am....

82
01:27:05,300 --> 01:27:08,000
I'm talking about silly things
like Dusseldorf.

83
01:27:10,100 --> 01:27:12,200
-You will forgive me?
-Of course.

84
01:27:12,300 --> 01:27:14,000
Thank you. I tell you what.

85
01:27:14,000 --> 01:27:18,300
We will have one more schnapps together,
and then I'll see you to your quarters.

86
01:27:18,600 --> 01:27:20,200
-Thank you.
-Frulein!

87
01:27:26,400 --> 01:27:29,300
Now that we're comfortable,
the first order of business...

88
01:27:29,300 --> 01:27:33,000
is to find out exactly who everybody is
and what they're doing here.

89
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:35,100
Now, first the lieutenant.

90
01:27:35,800 --> 01:27:37,300
He's an assassin...

91
01:27:37,400 --> 01:27:41,700
a member of the American
intelligence organization known as OSS.

92
01:27:42,100 --> 01:27:45,900
His job was to shoot you, Col. Kramer,
and you, Gen. Rosemeyer.

93
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:50,000
Now, Gen. Carnaby's mission
was twofold:

94
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,000
First, to allow himself to be tortured...

95
01:27:52,100 --> 01:27:54,700
into giving you the wrong plans
for the second front...

96
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,900
and secondly, to afford the British...

97
01:27:57,000 --> 01:28:00,100
a perfect excuse to send in
a team of experts to rescue him.

98
01:28:00,200 --> 01:28:03,100
Which brings us to our three friends here...

99
01:28:03,200 --> 01:28:05,600
and the cleverest phase
of the British operation.

100
01:28:05,700 --> 01:28:08,300
-They are, of course, members of Ml6.
-That's a lie.

101
01:28:08,300 --> 01:28:09,600
Let him finish!

102
01:28:10,400 --> 01:28:13,300
Their job was to penetrate
the German High Command...

103
01:28:13,400 --> 01:28:16,800
instead of the real Thomas, Berkley,
and Christiansen...

104
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:19,400
who worked for us in London...

105
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:23,100
and were discovered and captured
by the British about a month ago.

106
01:28:23,200 --> 01:28:25,600
That's another lie.
You can't prove any of this.

107
01:28:25,700 --> 01:28:27,000
Can't l?

108
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:29,800
Any denials, Lieutenant?

109
01:28:34,000 --> 01:28:37,200
Now, Gen. Carnaby,
perhaps you'd be good enough...

110
01:28:37,200 --> 01:28:40,200
to give us your real name, rank,
and serial number.

111
01:28:50,800 --> 01:28:53,500
Cartwright Jones, Corporal, U.S. Army...

112
01:28:53,600 --> 01:28:56,300
RA 1 23-025-3964.

113
01:28:57,500 --> 01:28:58,800
Thank you.

114
01:28:59,700 --> 01:29:03,500
Having successfully substituted
these three British agents for our men...

115
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:06,100
what was the next phase
of the British plan?

116
01:29:06,200 --> 01:29:08,700
To penetrate the German High Command.

117
01:29:08,800 --> 01:29:10,800
How? Simple.

118
01:29:11,300 --> 01:29:15,000
Stage a fake air crash
with a fake American general on board...

119
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:18,200
send in special agents
to effect his release...

120
01:29:18,300 --> 01:29:20,500
be sure that they fail in their mission...

121
01:29:20,500 --> 01:29:23,000
and hopefully,
these men would be taken to Berlin...

122
01:29:23,100 --> 01:29:25,900
where they would be
right in the heart of the Wehrmacht.

123
01:29:26,000 --> 01:29:29,600
And, you, Maj. Schmidt,
what were your orders on this mission?

124
01:29:30,300 --> 01:29:33,600
To lead them in and make
my own way out through Switzerland.

125
01:29:34,900 --> 01:29:36,700
-It's incredible.
-Yes.

126
01:29:37,700 --> 01:29:40,000
But to the British, very simple.

127
01:29:40,600 --> 01:29:43,400
You were going to give us
some proof of who you are.

128
01:29:43,500 --> 01:29:44,900
Certainly, General.

129
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:49,000
The proof is in three parts.
First, if I'm not who I say I am...

130
01:29:49,100 --> 01:29:52,100
what am I doing here?
What can I possibly hope to gain?

131
01:29:52,400 --> 01:29:56,400
The rescue of an impostor,
the exposure of three spies. Who to?

132
01:29:56,700 --> 01:29:59,400
To the very people
they're supposed to be working for.

133
01:29:59,500 --> 01:30:01,300
I have nothing to gain.

134
01:30:02,100 --> 01:30:05,500
Also, if these people
are what they say they are...

135
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:09,300
they would know the name
of our top agent in Whitehall.

136
01:30:10,000 --> 01:30:12,300
-Yes.
-So why don't we ask them?

137
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,300
They should know
the man who sent them on this mission.

138
01:30:20,400 --> 01:30:22,600
We all work through contacts!

139
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,000
It wasn't necessary
or safe for us to know...

140
01:30:25,100 --> 01:30:27,100
where our orders were coming from.

141
01:30:27,100 --> 01:30:31,200
Then I should be in the same boat as you,
but I know his name and you don't.

142
01:30:34,500 --> 01:30:36,000
Secondly, Colonel, you have...

143
01:30:36,100 --> 01:30:38,900
one of the most powerful
radio transmitters in Europe.

144
01:30:39,000 --> 01:30:41,600
Put a radio telephone call through...

145
01:30:42,100 --> 01:30:44,600
to Field Marshal Kesselring's headquarters
in ltaly...

146
01:30:44,700 --> 01:30:48,100
and ask for his Chief of lntelligence,
a Maj. Wilhelm Wilner.

147
01:31:01,500 --> 01:31:05,800
There's Col. Kramer on the telephone
from the Schloss Adler in Bavaria.

148
01:31:07,100 --> 01:31:08,800
He says it's very urgent.

149
01:31:09,500 --> 01:31:11,400
Maj. Wilner speaking.

150
01:31:13,400 --> 01:31:14,500
Ja, Colonel.

151
01:31:14,600 --> 01:31:17,700
-Can you describe him?
-That will not be necessary.

152
01:31:18,300 --> 01:31:20,600
Ask him to show you his right forearm.

153
01:31:21,100 --> 01:31:23,900
-May I see your right forearm?
-Certainly.

154
01:31:25,900 --> 01:31:29,800
There are two parallel scars,
about three centimeters apart.

155
01:31:30,700 --> 01:31:32,200
The scars are there.

156
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Ask how did he get them.

157
01:31:35,000 --> 01:31:37,300
-How did you get those?
-I was born with them.

158
01:31:37,400 --> 01:31:39,000
He says he was born with them.

159
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:42,100
That is right. Tell him he's a traitor.

160
01:31:42,300 --> 01:31:44,100
Tell him he's a renegade.

161
01:31:45,300 --> 01:31:47,900
That is Schmidt. No question about it.

162
01:31:48,900 --> 01:31:51,500
-Thank you, Major.
-Thank you, Colonel.

163
01:31:52,200 --> 01:31:53,500
Good night.

164
01:31:55,100 --> 01:31:56,700
Give me the water.

165
01:32:01,500 --> 01:32:04,500
As you know, the real Thomas,
Christiansen, and Berkley...

166
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:07,200
while working
for British counterespionage...

167
01:32:07,500 --> 01:32:11,300
were responsible for setting up
a chain of agents throughout Britain.

168
01:32:12,200 --> 01:32:15,000
Now, if these men
are who they claim to be...

169
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:16,700
it would be reasonable...

170
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:20,100
to expect them to be able
to write down a list of those agents.

171
01:32:20,100 --> 01:32:23,600
You could then compare their lists
with the genuine one...

172
01:32:23,700 --> 01:32:26,900
-which I have in this book.
-There's something very wrong, Colonel.

173
01:32:27,000 --> 01:32:30,800
I don't doubt who Schmidt is,
but there has been some mistake.

174
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:33,300
Yes. You're the ones who have made it.

175
01:32:34,200 --> 01:32:38,500
Frulein, would you be good enough
to get some pencils and some notebooks...

176
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:41,400
and we'll soon find out
who's speaking the truth.

177
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,200
Good night, Maria.
You are a most charming girl.

178
01:32:48,400 --> 01:32:49,800
Good night, and thank you.

179
01:32:49,900 --> 01:32:53,000
We must get to know each other
just a little bit better.

180
01:32:53,200 --> 01:32:54,500
Good night.

181
01:33:48,100 --> 01:33:49,800
Any one of these will do.

182
01:34:20,500 --> 01:34:22,500
Now compare it with my original.

183
01:34:38,400 --> 01:34:39,500
Guard!

184
01:34:43,400 --> 01:34:45,200
Stay as you were, gentlemen.

185
01:34:46,000 --> 01:34:47,400
Just relax.

186
01:34:52,700 --> 01:34:54,300
Second-rate punk?

187
01:34:55,100 --> 01:34:57,500
All I could think of
on the spur of the moment.

188
01:34:57,500 --> 01:35:00,000
-Thanks. That even makes it worse.
-Sorry.

189
01:35:02,300 --> 01:35:04,800
Between them,
they shouldn't have missed anything.

190
01:35:04,800 --> 01:35:09,000
-This is all you want. Those books?
-Lots of nice names and addresses.

191
01:35:10,000 --> 01:35:11,500
And these men?

192
01:35:11,900 --> 01:35:14,100
Then they are who they claim to be?

193
01:35:14,400 --> 01:35:17,700
I'm afraid so. They've been
under suspicion for some time.

194
01:35:17,800 --> 01:35:21,900
Classified information was going out,
and useless information was coming in.

195
01:35:22,000 --> 01:35:25,600
It took several weeks to pin it on
the departments controlled by those men.

196
01:35:25,700 --> 01:35:28,300
But we knew we couldn't prove it,
and even if we could...

197
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:30,900
what we really wanted
was the names of their contacts.

198
01:35:31,000 --> 01:35:34,600
These names and addresses.
So we thought this plan up.

199
01:35:34,700 --> 01:35:37,100
And Maj. Wilner,
Kesselring's Chief of lntelligence?

200
01:35:37,200 --> 01:35:39,900
He truly believes me
to be one of his top agents in ltaly.

201
01:35:40,000 --> 01:35:44,100
I've been feeding him useless, false, and
out-of-date information for a few years.

202
01:35:44,100 --> 01:35:45,800
-All right, gentlemen--
-Stay where you are!

203
01:35:49,600 --> 01:35:52,600
I'd advise everyone to keep perfectly still.

204
01:35:55,600 --> 01:35:57,300
Drop your gun, Major.

205
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:01,400
You, too, Lieutenant.

206
01:36:09,900 --> 01:36:11,200
By the fireplace.

207
01:36:14,500 --> 01:36:16,700
Thank God you're here.
We were just about--

208
01:36:16,700 --> 01:36:18,500
Sit down, Colonel!

209
01:36:25,600 --> 01:36:27,800
Everybody remain as he is...

210
01:36:30,300 --> 01:36:33,800
until I find out
what exactly is going on here.

211
01:36:33,900 --> 01:36:36,600
-What do you mean?
-Surely, you can see what's--

212
01:36:36,600 --> 01:36:39,300
Sit down, Colonel.

213
01:36:40,300 --> 01:36:43,200
It's perfectly simple, Major.
The Lieutenant and myself...

214
01:36:43,300 --> 01:36:45,900
have just uncovered a plot
to assassinate the Fhrer.

215
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:48,300
-This is preposterous!
-General!

216
01:36:49,900 --> 01:36:51,200
Sit down.

217
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:57,800
These people were all involved in
a conspiracy to overthrow the Third Reich.

218
01:36:57,900 --> 01:37:00,800
In my pocket here,
I have the names of all the conspirators.

219
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:04,200
Just before you interrupted us,
we put this entire party under arrest.

220
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:08,000
The list in his pocket are the names
of German agents working in Britain!

221
01:37:08,100 --> 01:37:10,500
I don't expect you to believe me, Major.

222
01:37:10,500 --> 01:37:14,800
But you'll certainly believe these names
if you'll permit me to show them to you.

223
01:37:18,100 --> 01:37:19,500
Let me see them.

224
01:37:22,400 --> 01:37:24,500
Careful, Major.

225
01:37:26,600 --> 01:37:28,100
Go very slowly.

226
01:37:43,600 --> 01:37:45,000
Bring them here.

227
01:38:06,100 --> 01:38:08,400
All of you, get up! Stand over there!

228
01:38:09,800 --> 01:38:11,300
Put your hands up!

229
01:38:15,400 --> 01:38:18,100
Jones, see if you can find something
to tie them up with.

230
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,200
Mary, bring that bag over here.

231
01:38:23,400 --> 01:38:26,300
-What do we do with these three?
-Take them with us.

232
01:38:26,300 --> 01:38:27,400
You were late.

233
01:38:27,500 --> 01:38:30,400
-One day I won't come at all.
-Keep your eye on those three.

234
01:38:30,500 --> 01:38:32,400
Lieutenant, in the next 1 5 minutes...

235
01:38:32,500 --> 01:38:35,400
we have to create enough confusion
to get out of here alive.

236
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:39,200
Major, right now, you got me
about as confused as I ever hope to be.

237
01:38:39,300 --> 01:38:42,200
The armory's here.
If we blow it up, the castle will think...

238
01:38:42,300 --> 01:38:44,200
it's being attacked by a division.

239
01:38:44,200 --> 01:38:47,200
On the other side of the castle over here,
is the radio room.

240
01:38:47,300 --> 01:38:50,500
I'll take the others and meet you there.
You take the map.

241
01:38:59,200 --> 01:39:00,600
Mary, we're going.

242
01:39:03,300 --> 01:39:06,000
Let me make myself perfectly understood.

243
01:39:06,400 --> 01:39:10,800
If any of you utters a word, I'll kill you all.
You understand?

244
01:39:11,600 --> 01:39:14,000
Jones, get the Major's gun. Now move.

245
01:39:15,700 --> 01:39:16,800
Go!

246
01:39:46,200 --> 01:39:47,400
This way.

247
01:41:56,300 --> 01:41:59,800
Wait. Go back. Jones, go on.
Mary, get in. Get in there.

248
01:42:29,000 --> 01:42:30,200
At ease.

249
01:42:34,500 --> 01:42:35,600
Hello.

250
01:44:23,000 --> 01:44:24,100
Get them in.

251
01:46:44,900 --> 01:46:46,700
All right, inside, quickly.

252
01:46:54,200 --> 01:46:55,700
You may need this.

253
01:47:22,100 --> 01:47:24,000
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

254
01:47:33,100 --> 01:47:34,300
We got company.

255
01:47:34,400 --> 01:47:36,400
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

256
01:48:10,900 --> 01:48:12,900
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

257
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:09,500
Broadsword calling Danny Boy.

258
01:49:18,000 --> 01:49:21,600
Get the rest of the men out of here
and report to the Kommandant.

259
01:49:33,200 --> 01:49:35,900
Danny Boy calling Broadsword. Over.

260
01:49:36,200 --> 01:49:39,400
Everything ready.
We need transport. Understood?

261
01:49:39,500 --> 01:49:41,500
-Over.
-Understood.

262
01:49:41,700 --> 01:49:43,500
Do you have it? Over.

263
01:49:44,400 --> 01:49:46,800
We have it all. Over.

264
01:49:47,600 --> 01:49:49,100
All sins forgiven.

265
01:49:56,100 --> 01:49:57,100
Damn it.

266
01:50:12,500 --> 01:50:14,600
Get Thomas out of there. Quickly.

267
01:50:25,100 --> 01:50:26,100
Now!

268
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,700
Get out. Climb out.

269
01:50:43,500 --> 01:50:44,900
Get on with it!

270
01:50:56,600 --> 01:50:57,500
Grenades.

271
01:51:52,900 --> 01:51:54,800
Outside! Out!

272
01:52:29,800 --> 01:52:30,900
All right.

273
01:52:32,400 --> 01:52:34,100
Lieutenant, get the rope.

274
01:53:08,500 --> 01:53:09,800
Back. Get back.

275
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,600
All right, to the right.

276
01:54:11,400 --> 01:54:12,900
Quick. Move it.

277
01:54:20,700 --> 01:54:22,500
Damn! Blast it!

278
01:54:24,300 --> 01:54:25,300
Get moving.

279
01:54:43,800 --> 01:54:45,800
All right. Get those men untied.

280
01:54:49,500 --> 01:54:53,300
Put those coats on if you don't want
to freeze to death. Quickly, now.

281
01:56:52,500 --> 01:56:54,300
Jones, get them out. Mary.

282
01:57:35,100 --> 01:57:37,600
Watch them. Right.

283
01:59:49,700 --> 01:59:53,800
-The doors to the corridor are locked.
-See what winch controls they have.

284
02:00:01,900 --> 02:00:05,800
-There's a stop and start button.
-See if you can make the motor work.

285
02:00:10,900 --> 02:00:12,900
-Not bad, huh?
-Yes, good.

286
02:00:13,200 --> 02:00:17,300
Now bring it down here and we'll get
on top and you can take us back inside.

287
02:00:22,900 --> 02:00:25,600
-Mary, bring them out here!
-Go on.

288
02:00:37,200 --> 02:00:39,500
Get ahold of the rope and climb down.

289
02:00:41,400 --> 02:00:42,800
Climb down!

290
02:01:19,900 --> 02:01:21,100
Look out!

291
02:01:40,500 --> 02:01:44,200
We've got him, Smith! Now, listen, Smith.

292
02:01:44,600 --> 02:01:46,400
I'll make a deal with you.

293
02:01:46,700 --> 02:01:50,600
You let us go down in the car,
and we won't kill Schaffer.

294
02:01:55,600 --> 02:01:58,400
You bring him out
so I can see he's still alive.

295
02:02:00,900 --> 02:02:02,900
I'm bringing him out now!

296
02:02:03,400 --> 02:02:04,900
Get in the car.

297
02:03:04,700 --> 02:03:06,100
Give me that.

298
02:03:16,600 --> 02:03:17,800
Damn him!

299
02:03:24,900 --> 02:03:26,500
Up there. Get him!

300
02:05:13,300 --> 02:05:15,300
Help me. No.

301
02:05:27,100 --> 02:05:28,900
Help me.

302
02:05:36,900 --> 02:05:38,100
Please.

303
02:08:24,800 --> 02:08:27,300
-Where's the Major?
-He's on the cable car.

304
02:10:06,500 --> 02:10:07,900
Jones, the bag.

305
02:10:24,400 --> 02:10:25,600
Let's go.

306
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:42,800
Set the bombs to go off
in three and a half minutes.

307
02:12:15,000 --> 02:12:17,200
-Almost ready?
-Almost.

308
02:12:29,300 --> 02:12:30,500
All set.

309
02:12:36,100 --> 02:12:37,100
Go.

310
02:14:19,700 --> 02:14:23,600
-Twenty-five minutes. Can we make it?
-We can make it.

311
02:14:23,800 --> 02:14:26,400
-Point is, will they?
-God knows.

312
02:14:57,700 --> 02:14:59,400
Everybody on the floor.

313
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:04,100
Emergency. Get me
the Oberhausen Airfield immediately.

314
02:16:42,900 --> 02:16:46,500
-We've got company.
-Yeah. I saw them in the mirror.

315
02:16:50,500 --> 02:16:52,700
How long before we reach the poles?

316
02:16:53,300 --> 02:16:55,000
Just around the next turn.

317
02:16:55,700 --> 02:16:57,300
Oberhausen Airfield?

318
02:16:59,100 --> 02:17:00,700
Give me the Kommandant's office.

319
02:19:25,000 --> 02:19:26,100
Get ready.

320
02:21:14,400 --> 02:21:16,900
Set the rest of them and get out of here.

321
02:23:11,500 --> 02:23:12,600
Halt!

322
02:23:40,900 --> 02:23:42,800
Oberhausen control tower.

323
02:23:45,700 --> 02:23:47,700
Oberhausen control. Over.

324
02:23:47,900 --> 02:23:52,700
Am in serious trouble.
Request urgent permission to land. Over.

325
02:23:53,600 --> 02:23:55,700
Identify. Over.

326
02:23:56,700 --> 02:23:58,100
Light maneuvering.

327
02:23:58,200 --> 02:24:01,800
Third Jaeger Junker squadron
on night navigational exercise.

328
02:24:02,400 --> 02:24:05,300
One engine out. Losing altitude. Over.

329
02:24:06,000 --> 02:24:08,200
You are cleared
for immediate landing. Over.

330
02:24:08,200 --> 02:24:09,600
Coming in. Over.

331
02:25:50,100 --> 02:25:53,200
Fighter Wing 126,
Oberhausen Airfield calling. Over.

332
02:25:56,600 --> 02:25:58,200
Get the control tower.

333
02:27:17,200 --> 02:27:18,400
Get down.

334
02:28:24,100 --> 02:28:26,800
-Berkley wrote these names?
-Yes, sir.

335
02:28:29,700 --> 02:28:32,800
Ted Berkley. I can't believe it.

336
02:28:33,900 --> 02:28:36,600
And Thomas. And Christiansen.

337
02:28:38,800 --> 02:28:40,400
All three of them?

338
02:28:42,800 --> 02:28:45,600
-My God. It's incredible.
-Yes, quite.

339
02:28:46,700 --> 02:28:48,900
But not as incredible as the one name...

340
02:28:49,000 --> 02:28:51,400
that's missing from that list, Colonel.

341
02:28:53,400 --> 02:28:55,200
What name is that, Major?

342
02:28:56,500 --> 02:28:59,500
I have it in this notebook,
here in my pocket.

343
02:29:00,200 --> 02:29:03,000
Earlier tonight, I showed it to Col. Kramer.

344
02:29:03,100 --> 02:29:07,000
He agreed with me that
this was the top German agent in Britain.

345
02:29:21,000 --> 02:29:23,700
It's your name, Colonel.
Don't look so shocked.

346
02:29:24,100 --> 02:29:25,800
Surely, you suspected it.

347
02:29:26,700 --> 02:29:29,100
Otherwise, why were you here to meet us?

348
02:29:29,800 --> 02:29:31,700
In case you were found out?

349
02:29:34,700 --> 02:29:35,900
Go on.

350
02:29:37,700 --> 02:29:40,500
You see,
you underestimated Adm. Rolland.

351
02:29:40,600 --> 02:29:43,300
He'd suspected you and the others
for some time.

352
02:29:43,500 --> 02:29:46,800
He brought me and Mary back from ltaly
because we were the only ones...

353
02:29:46,900 --> 02:29:50,100
in his department
that he could trust, yourself included.

354
02:29:50,600 --> 02:29:53,800
He asked you to choose a leader
for this expedition.

355
02:29:53,800 --> 02:29:56,600
You chose me because you knew
from German intelligence...

356
02:29:56,600 --> 02:29:59,500
that I was a double agent.

357
02:30:00,500 --> 02:30:02,600
Adm. Rolland knew I was not.

358
02:30:03,600 --> 02:30:06,000
But for you, I was the perfect choice.

359
02:30:06,700 --> 02:30:10,400
-Now you're guessing, Smith.
-No guesswork, Colonel.

360
02:30:11,500 --> 02:30:15,700
Your pointing that gun at me
is sufficient evidence.

361
02:30:19,000 --> 02:30:21,200
You are pointing it at me, aren't you?

362
02:30:23,300 --> 02:30:24,400
Go on.

363
02:30:24,800 --> 02:30:28,700
Mary was brought on the mission without
your knowledge because I needed her...

364
02:30:28,800 --> 02:30:32,000
to get me into the castle.
The Lieutenant, being an American...

365
02:30:32,000 --> 02:30:34,100
had no possible connection with Ml6...

366
02:30:34,100 --> 02:30:36,800
and was the only member of the group
I could trust.

367
02:30:36,900 --> 02:30:39,600
I wasn't even sure
of Harrod and MacPherson...

368
02:30:39,700 --> 02:30:41,300
until they were killed by the others.

369
02:30:43,900 --> 02:30:46,800
Fascinating. Very fascinating.

370
02:30:47,900 --> 02:30:49,500
Perhaps even true.

371
02:30:51,300 --> 02:30:54,500
-Assuming for a moment--
-You're finished, Colonel.

372
02:30:59,600 --> 02:31:03,500
You're overlooking something, aren't you?

373
02:31:03,600 --> 02:31:04,800
Not at all.

374
02:31:05,300 --> 02:31:08,600
Adm. Rolland took you
to the plane himself, didn't he?

375
02:31:08,800 --> 02:31:11,900
He also made certain
that you had that gun, didn't he?

376
02:31:13,700 --> 02:31:16,600
We took the precaution
of removing the firing pin...

377
02:31:16,600 --> 02:31:18,500
before the mission started.

378
02:31:26,900 --> 02:31:28,600
Put it down, Colonel.

379
02:31:33,400 --> 02:31:37,100
Not so hasty, Lieutenant.
We mustn't cheat the hangman.

380
02:31:41,400 --> 02:31:43,200
What now, Major?

381
02:31:44,400 --> 02:31:46,200
You'll be tried for treason.

382
02:31:50,900 --> 02:31:53,300
A public trial would be embarrassing.

383
02:31:54,300 --> 02:31:56,600
Painful, not only for myself...

384
02:31:57,100 --> 02:32:01,200
but also for British lntelligence
and Adm. Rolland.

385
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:05,600
Perhaps, but not as painful
as that long drop to the end of the rope.

386
02:32:13,100 --> 02:32:17,300
I seem to have no cards left to play, do l?

387
02:32:19,400 --> 02:32:21,100
No, Colonel, you don't.

388
02:32:22,400 --> 02:32:24,300
Do I have an alternative?

389
02:32:25,000 --> 02:32:26,500
If you want it.

390
02:32:38,700 --> 02:32:40,100
Thank you.

391
02:32:41,800 --> 02:32:44,800
I'll have those books.

392
02:33:36,600 --> 02:33:38,400
Is that it, Major?

393
02:33:39,400 --> 02:33:41,500
Yes, that's it, Lieutenant.

394
02:33:43,700 --> 02:33:45,100
Do me a favor, will you?

395
02:33:45,200 --> 02:33:49,200
Next time you have one of these things,
keep it an all-British operation.

396
02:33:51,000 --> 02:33:52,800
I'll try, Lieutenant.

397
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:55,100
English
