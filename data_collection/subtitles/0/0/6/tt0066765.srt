{275}{364}In this picture|there are 47 people.
{388}{445}None of them can be seen.
{462}{509}In this film,|we hope to show you...
{523}{577}how not to be seen.
{641}{727}This is Mr. E. R. Bradshaw|of Napier Court...
{751}{827}Blackline Road, London, SE 14.
{848}{899}He cannot be seen.
{913}{961}Now I'm going to ask him|to stand up.
{976}{1046}Mr. Bradshaw,|will you stand up, please?
{1243}{1327}This demonstrates|the value of not being seen.
{1351}{1445}In this picture, we cannot see|Mrs. B. J. Smegma...
{1471}{1537}of 13 The Crescent, Belmont.
{1554}{1628}Mrs. Smegma,|will you stand up, please?
{1817}{1921}This is Mr. Nesbitt|of Harlow. Newtown.
{1948}{2015}Mr. Nesbitt,|will you stand up, please?
{2158}{2251}Mr. Nesbitt has learned|the first lesson of not being seen:
{2277}{2328}not to stand up.
{2343}{2434}However, he has chosen|a very obvious piece of cover.
{2534}{2632}Mr. E. W. Lambert of Homely,|The Burrows. Oswald Street...
{2659}{2709}has presented us with a poser.
{2723}{2795}We do not know|which bush he is behind.
{2814}{2865}But we can soon find out.
{3161}{3231}Yes. lt was the middle one.
{3269}{3335}Mr. and Mrs. Watson of Hull...
{3353}{3413}chose a very cunning way|of not being seen.
{3429}{3526}When we called at their house, we found|they had gone on two weeks holiday.
{3553}{3620}However, a neighbor told us|where they were.
{3709}{3784}And here is the neighbor|who told us where they were.
{3914}{3961}And here is where he lived.
{4004}{4068}And this is|where he was born.
{4567}{4617}And now for something|completely different.
{6323}{6383}Oh. Good evening.
{6399}{6451}Ladies and gentlemen ...
{6467}{6591}we apologize that the feature was|not quite as long as we'd anticipated.
{6623}{6682}Therefore,|there will be a short interval.
{6853}{6958}ln the meantime, we are pleased|to be able to show you a short film...
{6987}{7057}starring a man|with a tape recorder up his nose.
{8079}{8165}And now...  And now|a film starring a man...
{8188}{8260}with a tape recorder|up his brother's nose.
{9034}{9093}And now in stereo
{9724}{9788}Thank you.|That is the end of the interval.
{9807}{9860}Will you kindly return|to your seats?
{9876}{9958}We will now be proceeding|with the program as advertised.
{10108}{10155}Darling, you were wonderful.
{10168}{10224}Oh, really?
{10244}{10366}In 1971 the British Empire|lay in ruins.
{10398}{10490}Foreigners frequented the streets,|many of them Hungarians.
{10516}{10571}Not the streets.|The foreign nationals.
{10587}{10712}Anyway, many of these Hungarians went|into tobacconists ' to buy cigarettes.
{10744}{10803}There you are, sir.|Thank you.
{10963}{11009}Good morning, guy.
{11073}{11163}"I will not buy this record.|It is scratched."
{11188}{11237}I'm sorry?
{11252}{11344}l will not buy this record.|lt is scratched.'"
{11368}{11457}Oh, no, no, no.|This is a tobacconist's.
{11482}{11518}Tobaccon ist's.
{11589}{11672}"I will not buy this tobacconist's.|lt is scratched."
{11696}{11766}No. Tobacco.|Um, cigarettes.
{11786}{11820}Ci garettes?
{11953}{12045}- "My hovercraft is full of eels.""|- What?
{12069}{12144}""My hovercraft|is fuIl of eels.'"
{12199}{12271}- Ah, matches.|- Yeah ! Matches.
{12342}{12403}- "Do you want..."|- "Do you want."
{12421}{12457}Want.
{12468}{12584}"Do you want to come back to my place?|Bouncy, bouncy."
{12616}{12665}That'll be|six shillings, please.
{12678}{12801}"lf l said you had a beautiful body,|would you hold it against me?'"
{12834}{12889}"l am no longer infected.'
{12906}{12952}May I?
{12992}{13058}Costs six shillings.
{13351}{13387}Help!
{13859}{13962}- What's all this. then?|- "You have beautiful thighs.""
{13989}{14027}- What?|- He hit me.
{14039}{14128}"Drop your panties, Sir Arthur.|l can not wait till lunchtime!"
{14153}{14236}- Right!|- ""Oh, my nipples explode with delight!'"
{14259}{14320}The Hungarian gentleman|was subsequently released...
{14338}{14428}but his information led to the arrest|and trial of the real culprit.
{14453}{14483}l am.
{14493}{14565}You are hereby charged|that on the 28th day of May...
{14586}{14652}you did will fully|and with malice aforethought...
{14671}{14744}publish an alleged|English-Hungarian phrase book...
{14764}{14838}with intent to cause|a breach of the peace.
{14858}{14938}- How do you plead?|- Not guilty.
{14979}{15034}Mr. York, on the 28th of May...
{15049}{15139}- you published this phrase book.|- l did.
{15163}{15242}With Your Lordship's permission,|l would like to quote an example.
{15263}{15379}The Hungarian phrase meaning, "Can you|direct me to the railway station?"...
{15411}{15484}is here translated|by the English phrase...
{15503}{15564}"Please fondle my buttocks.'"
{15693}{15747}"Please fondle...
{15763}{15816}my buttocks."
{15832}{15878}Ah, yes.|lt's past the post office...
{15892}{15952}200 yards down|and then left at the light.
{16083}{16162}Left at lights.
{18069}{18119}Meanwhile, not far away...
{18133}{18238}Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey were|about to enter an unfamiliar office.
{18267}{18303}Next.
{19024}{19122}Oh. Are you the marriage|guidance counselor?
{19148}{19220}- Yes. Good morning.|- Morning.
{19319}{19415}And... good morning|to you, madam.
{19513}{19604}- Name?|- Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Putey.
{19694}{19814}And what is the name of your...|ravishing wife?
{19847}{19904}Wait. Don't tell me.
{19919}{20005}lt's... lt's something|to do with moonlight.
{20059}{20115}Goes with her eyes.
{20132}{20183}lt's soft and gentle...
{20198}{20256}warm and yielding.
{20273}{20319}Deeply lyrical, and yet...
{20333}{20416}tender and frightened,|like a tiny, white rabbit.
{20438}{20482}It's Dierdre.
{20597}{20643}What a beautiful name.
{20713}{20759}What a beautiful...
{20809}{20856}beautiful name.
{20982}{21059}And what seems to be the trouble|with your marriage, Mr. Putey?
{21079}{21148}lt started when we went|to Brighton on holiday together.
{21168}{21239}Dierdre - that's my wife - and l,|we've always been cIose companions...
{21259}{21331}and l never particuIarly|anticipated any marital strife.
{21352}{21415}The very idea of consulting|a professional marital advisor...
{21433}{21481}has always been of|the greatest repugnance to me.
{21496}{21604}Although, far be it from me|to impugn the nature of your trade or...
{21633}{21679}or profession.
{21768}{21850}- Do go on.|- We've always been close companions...
{21873}{21963}sharing the interests,|the gardening, the holiday money.
{21988}{22081}Twice a month of an evening, we settle|down to do the accounts together...
{22107}{22195}something which Dierdre -|that's my wife -
{22218}{22290}and I particularly look forward to|on account of her feet.
{22311}{22405}l should have said at the start that|I noted for having a grand sense of humor.
{22429}{22527}Although l've kept myself very much|to myself over the last couple of years.
{22554}{22644}lt"s only been as comparativeIy recently|as recently that l've begun to realize--
{22668}{22731}Well, perhaps "realize"|is too strong a word.
{22749}{22876}Uh, imagine that, uh,|l was not the only thing in her life.
{22909}{22961}You suspected your wife?
{22977}{23011}Wel I...
{23087}{23148}frankly, yes.
{23166}{23219}A bit.
{23233}{23293}Her behavior did seem to me--
{23309}{23387}Her behavior did seem to me.|who was there to see...
{23408}{23469}to be a little odd.
{23487}{23525}- Odd?|- To an extent.
{23537}{23594}l'm not by nature|a suspicious person.
{23611}{23705}l've got a reputation of an after-dinner|speaker, if you get my meaning.
{23731}{23767}l certainly do.
{23778}{23861}And in the area where people know me,|l"m very well known.
{23883}{23945}- Fine. Would you--|- Certainly.
{23963}{24035}lt was time to face the facts,|stop beating about the bush...
{24056}{24121}or l'd never be able to look myself|in the bathroom mirror again.
{24138}{24241}WouId you mind running along for 10--|make it 20 minutes. All right?
{24268}{24328}Yes. l"ll wait outside,|shall l?
{24463}{24549}Yes, that-that"s perhaps|the best thing.
{24573}{24673}Certainly set my mind at rest|on one or two scores there.
{25202}{25246}Arthur Putey!
{25288}{25379}Are you a man or a mouse?
{25403}{25469}You've been running too long,|Arthur Putey.
{25488}{25615}lt's time to stop, time to turn|and fight like a man.
{25648}{25710}Go back in there,|Arthur Putey.
{25728}{25830}Go back in there|and pull your finger out.
{25858}{25929}Yes! Yes, you're right
{25948}{26016}This is it, Arthur Putey!
{26036}{26115}This is your moment,|Arthur Putey!
{26137}{26212}At last you're a man!
{26372}{26427}Come out of there. Dierdre!|l know you're in there
{26443}{26506}- Go away!|- Righto.
{26981}{27161}
{27349}{27406}Oh, what a lovely little
{27717}{27774}Oh, what a lovely little--
{28098}{28185}- Oh, what a loveIy little--|- Stop itl Stop right therel
{28209}{28305}This is absolutely disgusting,|and lm not going to stand for itl
{28332}{28379}There. Kill
{18}{}
{30146}{30240}Cut! That's it. We're not going to allow|this sort of smut on the screen.
{30264}{30339}This depraved and degrading spectacle|is going to stop right now.
{30361}{30446}- Do you hear me? Stop it!|- Damn l Just when it was getting good.
{30693}{30740}Evening, squire.
{31137}{31170}You married?
{31212}{31291}- Yes.|- l"m a bachelor myself.
{31313}{31372}ls-- Is your wife a goer?
{31388}{31439}Eh? Know what l mean?|Nudge, nudge.
{31453}{31512}- Know what I mean? Say no more.|- l beg your pardon?
{31528}{31643}Your wife, does she go? Eh?|Know what l mean? Does she go?
{31673}{31736}- She sometimes goes.|- l'Il bet she does.
{31754}{31824}Say no more.|Know what l mean? Nudge, nudge.
{31843}{31912}- l'm afraid l don't quite folIow you.|- Follow me
{31932}{32032}That's good. A nod's as good|as a wink to a blind bat.
{32059}{32162}- Look, are you selling something?|- Selling. Selling. Very good.
{32189}{32242}Know what l mean?
{32258}{32337}Oh, wicked  You"re wicked, eh ?|Nudge, nudge.
{32358}{32430}A nod's as good as a wink|to a blind bat.
{32450}{32532}- But...|- Your wife a sport, eh?
{32555}{32650}- She likes sport, yes.|- l bet she does.
{32677}{32725}She's very fond of cricket.
{32738}{32804}Who isn't, eh?|Likes games.
{32823}{32882}Knew she would.|Who doesn't. eh?
{32899}{32947}She's been around a bit. eh?
{32962}{33010}She's traveled.|She's from Purley.
{33024}{33088}Oh! Say no more.
{33182}{33232}Know what l mean?|Say no more.
{33322}{33419}Your wife interested in,|uh, photography, eh?
{33445}{33529}"Photographs, eh?"|he asked him knowingly.
{33553}{33632}- Photography?|- Yeah . Snap. Grin. Wink. Nudge.
{33653}{33737}- Holiday stamps?|- Could be taken on holiday. CouId be.
{33760}{33826}Swimming costumes.|Nudge, nudge.
{33845}{33934}- Candid photography.|- No. l'm afraid we don't have a camera.
{33958}{34005}Oh. Still.
{34149}{34204}Look, are you trying|to insinuate something?
{34308}{34372}- Yes.|- Well?
{34390}{34458}Well, l mean,|you're a man of the world, aren't ya?
{34478}{34568}l mean, you know, you've, uh...|you've been around. You've been there.
{34593}{34672}- What do you mean?|- Well, you know, you've...
{34693}{34755}You've done it, uh, with a lady.
{34773}{34843}- You've slept with a lady.|- Yes.
{34895}{34927}What's it like?
{34967}{35028}Well, l think it's overrated.
{35084}{35131}Shut up, you !
{35198}{35273}- Good evening, class!|- Good evening.
{35293}{35353}- Where's all the others, then?|- They're not here.
{35370}{35445}l can see that!|What's the matter with 'em?
{35467}{35516}- Don't know.|- Perhaps they've got flu.
{35530}{35608}Flu! They should eat|more fresh fruit!
{35732}{35804}Right! Now, self-defense!
{35824}{35904}Tonight I shaIl be carryin' on|from where we got to last week...
{35927}{36035}when l was showin' you how to|defend yourselves against anyone...
{36063}{36159}who attacks you armed|with a piece of fresh fruit
{36225}{36307}- You said we wouldn't do fruit again.|- What do you mean?
{36329}{36387}We've done fresh fruit|for the last nine weeks.
{36403}{36492}What's wrong with fruit?|You think you know it all, eh?
{36517}{36555}Can't we try something eIse?
{36567}{36621}Like someone who attacks you|with a pointed stick.
{36637}{36683}Pointed stick?
{36762}{36874}We want to learn how to defend ourselves|against pointed sticks, do we?
{36903}{36975}Gettin' all|high and mighty, eh?
{36994}{37064}Fresh fruit not|good enough for you, eh?
{37114}{37176}Well, let me telI you|somethin', my lad!
{37194}{37284}When you're walkin' home tonight|and some great homicidal maniac...
{37308}{37429}comes after you with a bunch of|loganberries, don't come cryin' to me!
{37462}{37567}Right!|And now the passion fruit.
{37594}{37688}When your assailant lunges at you|with a passion fruit, like thus--
{37713}{37781}- We done the passion fruit.|- What?
{37800}{37902}- We've done the passion fruit.|- We done oranges, apples, grapefruits...
{37930}{38030}- Whole and segments.|- Greengages, pomegranates.
{38058}{38118}- Grapes, passion fruit.|- Lemons.
{38135}{38229}- Plums.|- And mangoes in syrup.
{38254}{38320}- How about cherries?|- We done them.
{38338}{38392}- Red and black?|- Yes.
{38438}{38485}All right, then.
{38573}{38656}Bananas. We haven't|done bananas, have we?
{38678}{38733}- No.|- Right!
{38748}{38849}How to defend yourself|against a man armed with a banana!
{38877}{38998}Catch. Now, it's quite simple|to deal with a banana fiend.
{39030}{39117}First of all , you force him|to drop the banana.
{39142}{39232}Then you eat the banana,|thus disarming him.
{39257}{39303}You have now|rendered him helpless!
{39317}{39389}- Suppose he's got a bunch.|- Shut up.
{39408}{39482}- Suppose he's got a pointed stick.|- Shut up!
{39533}{39588}Right! Now you, Mr. Apricot
{39603}{39666}- Harrison.|- Sorry. Mr. Harrison.
{39684}{39732}Come at me with that banana.
{39747}{39858}Be as vicious as you Iike with it.|Come on. Attack me!
{39888}{39952}No, no, no!|Put something into it, for God's...
{39970}{40028}Hold the banana like that.
{40045}{40104}That's better.|Now scream.
{40122}{40178}Good. Right.|Now attack me.
{40193}{40253}Come on, man ,|attack me!
{40392}{40450}Next, l eat the banana.
{40560}{40623}Now, l would just like|to point out...
{40642}{40742}that this film is displaying|a distinct tendency to become silly.
{40769}{40870}Now, nobody likes|a good laugh more than l do.
{40898}{40994}Except, perhaps,|my wife and some of her friends.
{41020}{41063}Oh , yes,|and Captain John son.
{41077}{41146}Come to think of it, most people|like a good laugh more than l do.
{41165}{41272}But that's beside the point. l'm warning|this film not to get siIly again.
{41302}{41412}Right. Now, Director,|on the command "Cut'"...
{41442}{41497}cut to the next scene.
{41513}{41588}- Director...|- This is a frightened city.
{41608}{41670}Wait for itl
{41688}{41744}Director, cut!
{41763}{41825}This is a frightened city.
{41843}{41942}Over these streets, over these houses,|hangs a pall of fear.
{41968}{42057}An ugly kind of violence is rife,|stalking the town.
{42173}{42279}Yes, gangs of old ladies|attacking fit, defenseless young men.
{42993}{43055}They just come up to you|and push you, like.
{43073}{43176}Shove you off the pavement. There's|usually about four or five of them.
{43203}{43287}Yeah, sometimes|it's three or four of them.
{43310}{43402}lt's not even safe to go out|down to the shops anymore.
{43460}{43568}Grannies are no respecter|of race, creed or sex.
{43598}{43659}Theirs is a harsh.|ruthless world...
{43677}{43771}a tough world, a world in which|the surgical stocking is king.
{43835}{43902}But what are they in it for,|these senile delinquents...
{43922}{43979}these layabouts in lace?
{43994}{44071}- Oh, the violence.|- The prestige, mainly.
{44093}{44173}- The free gifts.|- Poking the knee in the groin.
{44195}{44252}We like pulling the heads|off sheep.
{44268}{44337}And tea cakes.
{44357}{44439}We have a Iot of trouble with grannies.|Pension day i s the worst.
{44462}{44507}Soon as they get it,|they blow the lot...
{44520}{44602}on milk, tea, sugar,|a tin of meat for their cat.
{44625}{44696}The whole crux|of the problem, uh...
{44717}{44789}lies in the basic|dissatisfaction...
{44808}{44904}of these senile delinquents|with the world as they find it.
{44930}{45010}They begin to question, uh,|the values of their society.
{45033}{45087}They see their sons|and daughters growing up...
{45103}{45206}to become accountants, uh,|soIicitors, sociologists even.
{45233}{45304}And they begin to wonder,|"ls it all worth it? ls it all..."
{45675}{45769}Another prime target for vandalism|is telephone boxes.
{45878}{45925}But mostly,|they just live for kicks.
{46343}{46411}But there are other kinds|of violence abroad...
{46430}{46489}other gangs, equally vicious,|equally determined...
{46507}{46553}such as the baby snatchers.
{46688}{46747}Hey What is this?
{46764}{46816}Hey! Help !
{46832}{46927}l left him outside for a few moments|while l got some Brillo Pads.
{46953}{47042}When l came back, he was gone.|He was only 48!
{47067}{47155}And also vicious gangs|of "Keep Left" signs.
{47357}{47403}Right! Stop that!
{47417}{47482}lt's silly.|Very silly, indeed.
{47500}{47590}lt started off as a nice little idea|about old ladies attacking young men ...
{47615}{47669}but now it's just got silly.
{47684}{47734}His hair's too long|for a vicar too.
{47748}{47858}And you can tell those are not proper|"Keep Left" signs. Clear off, everyone!
{47888}{47934}You, come with me.
{48052}{48170}Right. Now Iet's see something decent|and military: some precision drilling.
{48202}{48280}Squad! Camp it up!
{48333}{48381}Ooh, get her! Whoops!
{48394}{48520}l've got your number, but you|couldn't afford me, dear, two, three.
{48553}{48613}l'll scratch your eyes out.
{48629}{48712}Don't come the bigger|dear bitch with us. dear.
{48734}{48838}We all know where you've been,|you military fairy, two, three.
{48867}{48933}One, two, three, four,|five, six.
{48952}{49010}Whoops!|Don't look now, girls.
{49027}{49109}The maid is just mince|in that jolIy color, Sergeant.
{49132}{49182}Two, three. Ooh !
{49234}{49296}Right! Stop that. Silly.
{49313}{49396}And a bit suspect, l think.|Time for a cartoon.
{49459}{49513}Once upon a time...
{49528}{49592}there was an enchanted prince...
{49610}{49680}who ruled the land|beyond the Wobbles.
{49762}{49882}One day he discovered|a spot on his face.
{49939}{49991}Foolishly, he ignored it.
{50007}{50099}And three years later,|he died of cancer.
{50123}{50170}The spot, however, flourished...
{50183}{50254}and soon set out|to seek its fortune.
{51307}{51384}Agnes, did you just see|who moved in next door?
{51404}{51478}Yes. Black as the ace of spades,|they were.
{51498}{51567}Oh, well,|there goes the neighborhood.
{51587}{51633}Oh, yes.
{52243}{52290}Next, please.
{52389}{52436}One at a time, please.
{52493}{52542}There is only me, sir.
{52713}{52779}So there is.|Take a, um...
{52842}{52914}- Seat?|- Seat. Take a seat.
{52933}{53024}So, you want to join|my mountaineering expedition, do you?
{53095}{53160}Who, me, sir?
{53178}{53258}- Yes, l'd very much like to, sir.|- Jolly good.
{53309}{53356}And how about you ?
{53407}{53473}There is onIy me, sir.
{53659}{53745}WeIl, bang goes|his application then.
{53769}{53842}Now, let me fill you in.|l'm leading this expedition...
{53863}{53962}and we're going to climb|both peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.
{53989}{54056}l thought there was|only one peak, sir.
{54438}{54527}Well. that l save a bit of time.|Well done.
{54552}{54621}Now, the object of|this year's expedition...
{54639}{54725}is to see if we can find any trace|of last year's expedition.
{54748}{54817}- Last year's expedition?|- Yes. My brother was leading that.
{54837}{54919}They were going to build a bridge|between the two peaks.
{55107}{55154}My idea, l'm afraid.
{55168}{55244}l ought to telI you that l have almost|everyone l need for this expedition.
{55265}{55332}But what special qualifications|do you have?
{55352}{55414}- Well, sir...|- Yes, you first.
{55432}{55486}- There is only me, sir.|- l wasn't talking to you.
{55502}{55600}- Carry on.|- l'm a fully qualified mountaineer.
{55680}{55726}Mountaineer?
{55897}{55964}Mouse. Moun...
{55983}{56093}Mountaineer: two men skilled|at climbing a mountain.
{56123}{56186}By Jove, that'd be useful.
{56203}{56281}Well, you're in.|Congratulations.
{56303}{56371}Both of you .|Now, what are your names?
{56389}{56436}Arthur Wilson.
{56518}{56552}Well, look.
{56563}{56643}l'll call you Arthur Wilson One|and you Arthur Wilson Two...
{56664}{56711}just to avoid confusion .
{56724}{56777}Are you actually leading|this expedition?
{56793}{56860}Yes, we are leading|this expedition to Africa.
{56878}{56961}- What routes wilI you both be following?|- Good questions.
{56983}{57074}We'll be leaving on one or other|of the January the 22...
{57098}{57151}and taking the following routes:
{57167}{57227}from Manchesters,|down through Oxfords...
{57243}{57315}taking the M1.5|through Londons to Purleys...
{57334}{57407}then the A25s|from Purleys to Dovers.
{57428}{57494}Thence Africas to Nairobis.
{57513}{57624}We take the south roads out of Nairobis|for about 12 miles and then ask.
{57653}{57728}- Does anyone speak Swahili?|- Most of them do down there.
{57749}{57818}No. Does anyone in our party|speak SwahiIi, sir?
{57838}{57906}- WeIl, Matron's got a smattering.|- Apart from the two Matrons.
{57925}{57983}Good Lord.|I forgot about her.
{57999}{58061}Apart from them, who else|is coming on our expedition ?
{58079}{58156}Well, we've got|the Arthur Brown twins,...
{58178}{58263}two botanists called Madchen,|the William Johnston brothers...
{58287}{58359}- Two of them.|- Four. Pair of identical twins.
{58378}{58446}Two of the Harry Baker quads|and you two.
{58484}{58563}- And none of these are mountaineers?|- Well, you two are.
{58584}{58649}And we've got a brace of guides|called Jimmy Blankensoft...
{58668}{58748}because Kilimanjaro|is a pretty tricky climb.
{58769}{58844}Most of it's up,|till we reach the very top...
{58865}{58927}and then it tends|to slope away rather sharply.
{58945}{59032}But Jimmy's put his heads together|and worked out a way up. Jimmy
{59104}{59181}Jimmy Blankensoft, Arthur Wilson.|Arthur Wilson , Jimmy Blankensoft.
{59203}{59242}Jimmy Blankensoft Two,|Arthur Wilson Two.
{59253}{59308}Arthur Wilson Two,|Jimmy Blankensoft One.
{59323}{59403}- Carry on, Jimmy.|- Don't worry about the...
{59425}{59479}We'lI get him up, all right.
{59683}{59794}Well, l'd better describe the route.|We start off simply up Kilimanjaro...
{59903}{59965}Quite simple.|No problem there, basically.
{59983}{60088}And then we go on to|the main face itself of Kilimanjaro.
{60117}{60175}lt's a bit difficult|here because...
{60323}{60381}There's a difficult bit 'round here|when you've got to go...
{60398}{60481}from the end of the mantel-piece|onto the coffee table.
{60503}{60577}lt's a bit of a difficuIt jump.|We don't need those.
{60598}{60686}Then you've got the rail up here,|which is quite a good fortune.
{60710}{60811}There's a terribly easy bit|over the floor up onto the chair.
{60838}{60888}And then we've got...
{60953}{61004}We get down.|We go quite simplistic.
{61158}{61208}He'll be Ieading|the first assault.
{61223}{61286}l'm afraid l shan't be coming|on your expedition, sir...
{61304}{61411}'cause l have absolutely no confidence|in anyone involved in it!
{61503}{61539}Oh. dear.
{61602}{61659}- What about you?|- l'm game, sir.
{61674}{61721}Jolly good.
{61810}{61839}Good Lord!
{62678}{62725}And now for something|completely different.
{62741}{62793}- lnspector!|- Yes, sir?
{62808}{62871}l was sitting on a park bench|and l put my coat down.
{62888}{62991}When l picked it up, l found my wallet|had gone and $15 had been stolen.
{63018}{63103}- Did you see anyone?|- No, no one at alI.
{63188}{63254}Well, there's very littIe|we can do about that, sir.
{63558}{63618}Do you want to come back|to my place?
{63765}{63813}Yeah, alI right.
{64951}{65021}And so Miss Spume|returned to her typing...
{65041}{65092}and dreamed|her little dreamy dreams...
{65108}{65207}unaware of the cruel trick|fate had in store for her.
{65234}{65293}For Miss Spume was|about to fall victim...
{65310}{65415}of the dreaded international|Chinese communist conspiracy
{65443}{65498}Yes, these fanatical fiends...
{65513}{65602}under the leadership|of the so-called Mao Tse-tung...
{65626}{65729}had caught Miss Spume off guard|for one brief but fatal moment...
{65834}{65881}and destroyed her...
{65929}{66012}just as they are ready to go|anytime free men anywhere...
{66035}{66102}waver in their defense|of democracy.
{66404}{66463}Once again, American defense...
{66479}{66555}proves its effectiveness|against international communism.
{66576}{66656}Using this diagram of a tooth|to represent any small country...
{66678}{66736}we can see how|international communism works...
{66753}{66814}by eroding away from within.
{66978}{67024}When one country, or tooth...
{67038}{67152}falls victim to international communism,|its neighbors soon follow.
{67183}{67268}ln dentistry, this is known|as the domino theory.
{67291}{67403}But with American defense,|the decay is stopped before it starts.
{67433}{67550}That's why nine out of ten|smalI countries choose American defense.
{67581}{67685}Or Crelm toothpaste|with the miracle ingredient Frauduline.
{67713}{67776}The white car represents|Crelm toothpaste...
{67793}{67843}with the miracle ingredient|Frauduline.
{67858}{67937}The not-white car represents|another toothpaste.
{68033}{68095}Both cars provide 30% protection.
{68166}{68235}At 60% protection,|both cars are doing well.
{68303}{68363}At 90% protection... Wait.
{68380}{68422}The not-white car is out...
{68435}{68527}and Crelm toothpaste goes on|to win with 100% protection.
{68553}{68618}Yes. do like all smart motorists.
{68636}{68687}Choose Crelm toothpaste!
{68703}{68810}Or Shrill petrol,|with the new additive GLC-9424075,...
{68839}{68897}after 6:00 p.m., 9424047.
{68913}{68977}Using this white card|to represent engine deposits...
{68995}{69113}and this black card to represent|Shrill's new additive, GLC-9424075,...
{69145}{69205}after 6:00 p.m., 9424047...
{69223}{69301}we can see how the engine deposits|are pushed off the face of the earth...
{69323}{69377}by the superior forces|available to Sh--
{69573}{69615}This is the police.
{69628}{69701}We know you're in there,|so come out with your hands up.
{69721}{69778}You'll never take me alive.|copper!
{69794}{69855}All right, then. Sergeant!
{70433}{70515}Conrad Poohs and His Dancing Teeth.
{71963}{72075}Thank you, thank you,|Conrad Poohs and His Exploding Teeth.
{72105}{72192}A smile, two fangs|and an "Excuse me."
{72216}{72280}And next tonight,|gentlemen and ladies...
{72298}{72380}here at the Peephole Club|for the very first time...
{72403}{72449}we're very proud to welcome...
{72463}{72561}Ken Ewing and His Musical Mice.
{72828}{72877}Thank you, thank you.
{72891}{72979}Ladies and gentlemen,|l have in this box...
{73004}{73063}23 white mice...
{73080}{73162}mice which l have|painstakingly trained...
{73185}{73231}over the past few years...
{73245}{73319}to squeak at a selected pitch.
{73373}{73420}This one is "A"-Sharp...
{73433}{73496}and th is one is "G.'"
{73514}{73606}"G", "A"-Sharp.|You get the general idea.
{73631}{73731}Now, these mice are so arranged|upon this rack...
{73758}{73836}that when played|in the correct order...
{73858}{73900}they will squeak...
{73913}{73984}"Three Blinded White Mice."
{74004}{74085}Ladies and gentlemen,|l give you, on the mouse organ...
{74108}{74169}"Three Blinded White Mice."
{74186}{74227}Thank you.
{74329}{74394}- Oh, my God!|- Somebody stop him.
{75114}{75161}Ten seconds, studio.
{75234}{75295}Stop him!|Stop that bastard!
{75419}{75517}Hello, and welcome to another|edition of lt's the Arts.
{75544}{75647}And we kick off this evening|with a look at the cinema.
{75674}{75779}One of the most prolific film directors|of this age, or indeed, of any age...
{75808}{75897}is Sir Edward Ross, back in this country|for the first time in five years...
{75921}{76015}to open a season of his films|at the National Film Theatre.
{76041}{76129}And we are indeed fortunate to have him|with us in the studio this evening.
{76154}{76204}- Good evening.|- Edward...
{76219}{76278}- You don't mind if l call you Edward?|- Not at all.
{76294}{76351}lt does seem to worry some people.|l'm not sure why.
{76368}{76454}Some are sensitive, so l do take the|precaution of asking on these occasions.
{76478}{76563}- No, that's fine.|- So Edward it is. Splendid.
{76586}{76661}- l'm sorry to have brought it up.|- No. Edward it is.
{76683}{76748}Thank you very much|for being so helpful.
{76766}{76860}-At times it's more than my job's worth.|-Quite.
{76886}{76979}Makes it hard to establish a rapport,|to put the other person at his ease.
{77005}{77051}- Quite.|- Quite.
{77065}{77130}Silly little point,|but it does seem to matter.
{77148}{77256}Still Iess said the better.|Ted, when you first went in the film...
{77285}{77350}You don't mind if l call you Ted,|as opposed to Edward?
{77368}{77419}- No. Everyone caIls me Ted.|- Splendid.
{77433}{77501}- Because it's much shorter, isn't it?|- Yes, it is.
{77520}{77601}- Much Iess formal.|- Ted, Edward, anything.
{77623}{77683}Splendid.|lncidentally, do call me Tom.
{77699}{77770}l don't want you bothering with|any of this "Thomas" nonsense.
{77876}{77940}Fine. Where were we?|Eddie baby, when you first...
{77958}{78053}l'm sorry. l don't like|being called Eddie baby.
{78078}{78160}- l beg your pardon?|- l don't like being called Eddie baby.
{78183}{78232}Now get on with your interview.
{78279}{78362}- Did l call you Eddie baby?|- Yes, you did.
{78384}{78458}l don't think l did.|Did l call him Eddie baby?
{78479}{78543}Yes, you did!
{78561}{78618}l didn't call you Eddie baby,|did l, sweetie?
{78634}{78693}- Don't call me sweetie.|- Can l call you sugar plum?
{78710}{78747}- No!|- Pussycat?
{78758}{78814}- No!|- Angel drawers?
{78829}{78884}No, you may not.
{78900}{78953}- Now get on with it.|- Can l call you Frank?
{79025}{79095}- Why Frank?|- Frank's a nice name.
{79115}{79184}President Nixon's got|a hedgehog called Frank.
{79203}{79289}- What is going on?|- Frank. Frankie. Fran. Frannie.
{79313}{79394}- Little Frannie Boo.|- That's it. l'm leaving.
{79416}{79480}Had enough of this.|l've never been so insulted.
{79499}{79574}- Tell us about your film, Sir Edward.|- What?
{79595}{79693}Tell us about your latest film,|Sir Edward, if you'd be so kind.
{79720}{79809}- None of this pussycat nonsense?|- Promise.
{79834}{79881}Please. Sir Edward.
{79934}{79981}- My latest film?|- Yes, Sir Edward.
{80043}{80166}I first had the idea, funniIy enough,|when l joined the industry in 1919.
{80198}{80261}Of course, in those days|l was only a tea boy...
{80278}{80322}Oh, shut up.
{80335}{80388}- There he is!|- Get him.
{80729}{80797}Stop him!
{80816}{80866}He's a murderer!
{80881}{80949}Come back, you fiend! Fiend!
{80968}{81015}He's a murderer!
{83513}{83575}"The room is full of milkmen...
{83623}{83698}some of whom are...
{83744}{83835}are very old."
{84013}{84073}This man is Ernest Scribbler...
{84090}{84147}manufacturer of jokes.
{84163}{84258}In a few moments he will think|of the funniest joke in the world...
{84284}{84378}and as a result|he will die laughing.
{85679}{85751}lt was obvious|the joke was lethal.
{85771}{85831}No one could read it and live.
{85849}{85929}Scribbler's mother, alarmed by|the unusual sounds of merriment...
{85951}{86051}entered the room and found|what was, apparently...
{86079}{86126}a suicide note.
{87010}{87057}The war against the Hun|continues...
{87071}{87130}and as Britain's brave boys|battle against the Bosch...
{87148}{87225}their leaders are on the lookout for|new breakthroughs that could provide...
{87246}{87316}the ultimate weapon|in the war against the Hun.
{87393}{87490}Here, ln this little house in Pinchley,|they think maybe they've found it.
{87516}{87617}lt's a joke so deadly, it could have|Fritz"s forces falling about.
{88063}{88114}Tests on Salisbury Plain confirm...
{88128}{88222}the joke's devastating effectiveness|at a range of up to 50 yards.
{89138}{89209}Fantastic!
{89256}{89321}All through the winter of '43...
{89340}{89425}we had translators working|in joke-proof conditions...
{89449}{89548}to try and manufacture|a German version of the joke.
{89575}{89657}They worked on one word each|for greater safety.
{89680}{89789}One of them saw two words by mistake and|had to spend several weeks in hospital.
{89818}{89886}But apart from that,|things went ahead pretty fast.
{89904}{89965}And by January|we had the joke in a form...
{89983}{90078}which our troops couldn't understand,|but which the Germans could.
{90103}{90173}So on July the 8th, 1944...
{90193}{90248}the joke was first told|to the enemy...
{90263}{90310}in the Ardennes.
{90364}{90437}Squad, teIl the joke!
{91251}{91307}ln action, it was deadly.
{92424}{92474}The German casualties|were appalling.
{92788}{92864}lt was a fantastic success|over 80,000 times as powerful...
{92885}{92954}as Britain's great prewar joke,|which was used at Munich...
{92972}{93019}and one which Hitler|couldn't match.
{93312}{93394}l would like to apologize|for the rather poor taste...
{93417}{93463}of the previous item.
{93517}{93568}And excuse me, please.
{94646}{94692}Fleet Street, please.
{94736}{94782}All right, everybody,|stay close.
{94796}{94846}Don't lag behind.|Keep together, everybody.
{94861}{94925}Remember. Watch out|for the killer cars.
{95075}{95120}Yes, the killer cars.
{95132}{95252}For years the city had been plagued by|ever-increasing pedestrian congestion.
{95285}{95338}ln an attempt to eliminate|this problem...
{95352}{95407}certain fanatical cars,..
{95422}{95493}had taken the law|into their own hands.
{95614}{95673}But the days of the killer cars|were numbered...
{95689}{95771}thanks to the miracle|of atomic mutation.
{96274}{96343}Thank you!|You've saved our city!
{96362}{96408}But at what cost?
{96585}{96670}Just then as it looked for certain,|that the city was about to be eaten...
{96692}{96775}the earth trembled and the sun|was blotted out from the sky.
{96839}{96903}Suddenly, swarms of giant|bees filled the air...
{96921}{97021}and 300 million armored horsemen covered|with coats of 1,000 different colors...
{97049}{97120}appeared at every street corner|attacking the monster cat...
{97139}{97194}in a scene of such|spectacular proportions...
{97210}{97299}that it could never in your life be seen|in a low-budget film like this.
{97324}{97378}lf you'd notice,|my mouth isn't moving either.
{97394}{97476}But just as the monster cat|was starting to weaken...
{97497}{97560}the earth split apart|with a deafening roar and...
{99015}{99077}Hello. l wish|to register a complaint.
{99135}{99208}- Hello. Miss?|- What do you mean, "miss"?
{99267}{99351}Oh, l'm sorry. l have a cold.|l wish to make a complaint.
{99421}{99473}Sorry.|We're closing for lunch.
{99487}{99565}Nevermind that, my lad.|l wish to complain about this parrot...
{99587}{99666}what l purchased not half an hour ago|from this very boutique.
{99687}{99763}Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue.|What's wrong with it?
{99785}{99837}l'll tell you what's|wrong with it, my lad.
{99852}{99919}lt's dead.|That's what's wrong with it.
{99937}{100004}No, it's resting. Look.
{100024}{100134}Look, my Iad, l know a dead parrot when|l see one and l'm looking at one now.
{100162}{100218}No, that's not dead,|it's resting.
{100235}{100290}- Resting?|- Yeah, resting.
{100306}{100377}Remarkable bird, the Norwegian blue,|isn't it? Beautiful plumage.
{100397}{100495}The plumage don't enter into it.|lt's still dead.
{100522}{100570}No, it's resting.
{100622}{100711}All right, then.|lf it's resting, l'lI wake it up.
{100736}{100774}Hello, Polly!
{100832}{100946}l've got a nice, fresh cuttlefish for|you if you wake up, Mr. Polly Parrot!
{100977}{101047}- There, he moved.|- No, that was you pushing the cage.
{101067}{101121}- l didn't.|- Yes, you did
{101137}{101185}Hello, Polly!
{101269}{101316}Wakey, wakey!
{101379}{101441}Rise and shine.
{101457}{101524}This is your 9:00 alarm call.
{101691}{101737}That's what l call|a dead parrot.
{101780}{101840}- No, he's stunned.|- Stunned?
{101857}{101916}Yeah, you stunned him|just as he was wakin' up.
{101932}{102012}- Norwegian blues stun easily.|- l've had enough of this.
{102034}{102132}That parrot is definitely deceased,|and when l bought it a half hour ago...
{102159}{102223}you assured me that|its total lack of movement...
{102241}{102351}was due to it being tired|and shagged out after a long squall.
{102381}{102449}Well, he's pining|for the fjords.
{102572}{102678}Pinin' for the fjords?|What kind of talk is that?
{102707}{102790}Look, why did it faIl flat on its back|the minute l got it home?
{102814}{102909}Well, the Norwegian blue prefers|keeping on its back. Beautiful plumage.
{102934}{103034}Look, l took the liberty of examining|that parrot and l discovered...
{103061}{103150}the only reason it had been sitting|on its perch in the first place...
{103175}{103250}was that it had been|nailed there.
{103271}{103317}Oh, well, of course|it was nailed there.
{103331}{103438}lf l hadn't nailed it there, it would|have muscled up to those bars and boom.
{103467}{103505}Look here mate.
{103549}{103656}This parrot wouldn't boom|if you put 4,000 volts through it.
{103684}{103738}lt's bleedin' demised.
{103787}{103834}No, it's pining.
{103847}{103942}lt's not pining,|it's passed on.
{103997}{104054}This parrot is no more.
{104071}{104128}lt has ceased to be.
{104144}{104227}lt's expired and|gone to see its maker.
{104250}{104322}This is a late parrot!
{104370}{104410}lt's a stiff.
{104422}{104494}Bereft of Iife.|lt rests in peace.
{104515}{104612}If you hadn't nailed it to the perch,|it would be pushing up the daisies.
{104637}{104725}lt's run down the curtain|and joined the choir invisible.
{104750}{104866}This is an ex-parrot.
{104982}{105036}Well. I'd better|replace it then.
{105052}{105119}lf you want to get anything done in|this country you've got to complain ...
{105137}{105191}till you're blue in the mouth.
{105207}{105259}Sorry, squire.|We're right out of parrots.
{105275}{105324}l see.|l get the picture.
{105389}{105479}- l've got a slug.|- Does it talk?
{105547}{105593}Not really.
{105607}{105681}Well, it's scarcely|a replacement then, is it?
{105782}{105875}Listen. l didn't want|to work in a pet shop.
{105901}{105957}l wanted to be a lumberjack.
{106052}{106098}Sorry. This is irrelevant.
{106112}{106112}Yes, a lumberjack!
{106112}{106173}Yes, a lumberjack!
{106191}{106303}Leaping from trees as they float down|the mighty rivers of British Columbia.
{106332}{106391}The giant redwood!
{106407}{106457}The larch!
{106472}{106557}The fir!|The mighty Scotch pine!
{106581}{106627}What about my bIoody parrot?
{106641}{106712}The smell of fresh-cut timber!
{106732}{106800}The crash of mighty trees.
{106820}{106936}With my best girl|by my side, we'd sing!
{107090}{107151}I'm a lumberjack|and l'm okay
{107169}{107233}I sleep all night|and I work all day

{110885}{110955}Good evening, madame.|Good evening, sir.
{110975}{111045}May l say what a pleasure it is|to see you here again, sir?
{111065}{111166}Thank you. Apparently,|the boeuf en croute is fantastic.
{111192}{111255}lf l may recommend, sir,|the faisan a la reine.
{111274}{111346}The sauce is one of the chef's|most famous creations.
{111366}{111422}- Mmm, that sounds very good.|- Sounds lovely.
{111437}{111499}Anyway, darling,|have a look at the menu.
{111517}{111571}See what you want.|Take your time.
{111587}{111677}By the way, l've got a bit of a dirty|fork. Could you get me another one?

{111825}{111914}-Sir, l do apologize.|-No need to apologize. Doesn't worry me.

{112582}{112636}Yes, they really|look after you here.
{112652}{112718}This alI looks delicious.

{112894}{112951}This is filthy.|Who the helI washes up?
{112967}{113037}Find out who washes up and give|them their cards immediately.
{113057}{113122}No! On second thought,|we can't take any chances.
{113141}{113234}- Sack the entire washing-up staff|- l don't want to cause any troubIe.
{113260}{113359}lt's quite right that you bring|this sort of thing to our attention.

{113497}{113571}- Please, l don't want to make any fuss.|- Oh, no, there's no fuss.

{113840}{113952}l know, and l'm sorry.|Bitterly sorry.
{113982}{114090}But l know nothing I can say can alter|the fact that in this restaurant...
{114120}{114233}you have been given a dirty,|filthy, smelIy piece of cutlery.
{114262}{114321}- lt wasn't smelly.|- lt is smelly.
{114337}{114396}And obscene and disgusting.|l hate it.
{114412}{114495}- That's enough, Gilberto.|- Dirty, nasty, smutty!
{114569}{114627}Good evening, sir.|Good evening, madame.
{114642}{114733}l'm the manager.|l've only just heard what's happened.
{114759}{114823}- May l sit down?|- Yes, of course.
{114917}{115025}l want to apologize|humbly, deeply and sincerely...
{115055}{115101}about the fork.
{115115}{115204}No. Really, it was only a tiny piece|of dirt. You can hardly see it.
{115229}{115349}Oh, you're good, kind,|fine people for saying that.
{115381}{115478}But l can see it.|To me it's Iike a boulder...
{115505}{115558}a vast bowl of pus.
{115597}{115717}- Oh, it's not that bad.|- No, it gets me here.
{115750}{115822}l can't give you any excuses.|There are no excuses.
{115842}{115910}l've been meaning to spend|more time in the restaurant...
{115930}{116051}but l haven't been well recently and|things have been going badly back there.
{116084}{116145}Poor old Mrs. Dalrymple|who prepares the salad...
{116162}{116229}can hardly move|her poor, swollen fingers.
{116247}{116330}And then, of course,|there's Gilberto's war wound.
{116352}{116424}But they're good people,|and they're fine people...
{116445}{116530}and together we were beginning|to get over this bad patch.
{116552}{116618}There was light|at the end of the tunnel...
{116637}{116701}when this...
{116720}{116802}when this happened!
{116825}{116921}- Can l get you some water?|- lt's the end of the road!
{117020}{117084}You bastards!
{117102}{117139}You mean us?
{117151}{117235}You vicious,|heartless bastards!
{117307}{117358}Look what you've done to him.
{117372}{117473}He's worked his fingers to the bone|to make this place what it is!
{117501}{117582}And you come in here|with your petty...
{117605}{117682}vicious, heartless quibbling...
{117702}{117788}and you grind him|into the dirt.
{117885}{117962}This fine, honorable man...
{117984}{118079}whose boots you|are not worthy to kiss!
{118179}{118265}Oh, it makes me mad.
{118560}{118605}Easy, Mongo! Easy.
{118617}{118696}Stark, stirring mad.
{118719}{118785}No, Mongo! Oh!|Oh, the wound!
{118804}{118865}They destroyed him!
{118882}{118965}lt's the end! The end.
{119037}{119093}He's dead.
{119110}{119156}They killed him!
{119170}{119217}Revenge.
{119292}{119367}No, Mongo!|Never kill a customer.
{119387}{119450}Oh, the wound again.
{119469}{119528}They ruined him!
{119717}{119787}Lucky l didn't tell 'em|about the dirty knife.
{121022}{121072}Good morning.|lm a bank robber.
{121087}{121157}Please don't panic.|Just hand over all the money.
{121177}{121242}This is a Iingerie shop, sir.
{121402}{121440}Fine, fine.
{121567}{121621}Adopt, adapt and improve.
{121697}{121759}- Well, what have you got?|- We've got corsets, stockings...
{121777}{121850}suspender belts, tights, bras,|slips, petticoats, knickers...
{121871}{121922}socks and garters, sir.
{121937}{121975}Fine.
{122080}{122135}No large quantities|of money in safes?
{122151}{122210}No, sir.
{122227}{122309}No piles of cash|in easy-to-carry bags?
{122332}{122387}No, sir.
{122404}{122442}Fine.
{122762}{122808}Just a pair of panties then,|please.
{123117}{123168}And now for something|completely different.
{123336}{123393}Hey, did you see that?
{123476}{123557}Did you see something|go past the window?
{123580}{123602}What?
{123610}{123688}Somebody went past|that window, downwards.
{123857}{123900}Another one.
{123976}{124032}Another one just went past,|downwards.
{124085}{124112}What?
{124121}{124180}Two people have just fallen|past that window!
{124231}{124277}Fine.
{124291}{124402}Look, two people...three people|have just fallen past that window.
{124517}{124569}Must be a board meeting.
{124585}{124643}Oh, yeah.
{124658}{124756}- That was Wilkins of finance.|- No, that was Robertson.
{124783}{124850}- Wilkins.|- It was Robertson.
{124952}{125022}- That was Wilkins.|- Oh, yeah.
{125042}{125092}Bet Parkinson next.
{125107}{125175}- Bet you it won't.|- How much?
{125228}{125325}- What?|- How much do you bet it won't? Fiver?
{125352}{125427}- Yeah, all right.|- Right. Done. You're on.
{125448}{125497}Parkinson next.
{125592}{125657}- Come on, Parky!|- Don't be silly, Parky!
{125676}{125740}- Come on, Parky! Jump!|- Don't be stupid, man!
{125757}{125842}Dear Sir, l wouId like to complain|about that last scene...
{125866}{125923}about people falling|out of high buiIdings.
{125938}{126017}l myself have worked all|my life in such a building...
{126040}{126116}and have never once...
{128208}{128267}Psst. All clear.
{128557}{128646}Vocational guidance counselor.
{128997}{129092}Ah, Mr. Anchovy.|Do sit down.
{129118}{129190}Oh, thank you. Take the weight|off the feet, eh?
{129211}{129259}Yes.
{129273}{129330}Lovely weather|for the time of year, l must say.
{129347}{129429}Enough of this gay banter. Mr. Anchovy,|you asked us to advise you...
{129452}{129516}which job in life|you were best suited for.
{129535}{129591}- That is correct.|- Well. l have the results here...
{129607}{129676}of all the interviews and the aptitude|tests that you took last week...
{129696}{129801}and from them we've built up clear|impression of the person you are...
{129830}{129902}and l think l can say|without fear of contradiction...
{129922}{129981}that the ideal job for you|is accountancy.
{130028}{130064}But l am an accountant.
{130076}{130150}Jolly good. Well, back|to the office with you then.
{130171}{130217}No, no,|you don't understand.
{130231}{130289}l've been an accountant|for the Iast 20 years.
{130306}{130379}But l want a new job, something|exciting that will let me live.
{130400}{130456}But accountancy|is quite exciting.
{130472}{130546}Exciting? No, it's not.
{130567}{130630}lt's dull, dull, duIl!
{130648}{130706}My God, it's dull.
{130722}{130794}lt's so deadly dull|and tedious...
{130815}{130910}and stuffy and boring|and desperately dull !
{130936}{131005}I can't stand it any longer.|l want to live.
{131025}{131107}Well, yes, Mr. Anchovy, but,|you see, in your report here...
{131128}{131211}it says that you are|an extremely dull person.
{131272}{131327}Our experts describe you as...
{131342}{131412}"an appallingly dull fellow,"|"unimaginative",...
{131432}{131517}"timid, spineless, "|"easily dominated",...
{131541}{131608}"no sense of humor,"|"tedious company"...
{131627}{131682}and "irrepressibly|drab and awful."
{131697}{131772}And where as in most professions|these would be considerable drawbacks...
{131793}{131847}in accountancy|they are a positive boon.
{131863}{131952}l'm only as awful as this|because accountancy does this to peopIe.
{131977}{132040}Can't you help me?
{132057}{132107}Any idea of what you want to be?
{132122}{132188}- Yes. Yes, l have.|- What is it?
{132207}{132266}A lion tamer.
{132347}{132420}Yes. Of course,|it's a bit of a jump, isn't it...
{132441}{132501}accountancy to lion taming|in one go?
{132518}{132617}Don't think it'd be better to work your|way towards lion taming via banking?
{132645}{132700}- Or insurance?|- No! l don't want to wait.
{132716}{132773}l want to start immediately.|Tomorrow morning at 9:00...
{132788}{132841}l want to be in there, taming.
{132857}{132937}Yes, but what qualifications|do you have?
{132960}{133024}- l've got a hat.|- A hat?
{133042}{133112}Yes, a lion taming hat, a hat|with "Lion Tamer" written on it...
{133132}{133211}and it lights up, saying "Lion Tamer"|in big red neon letters...
{133232}{133280}so you can tame them|after dark.
{133295}{133356}- l see.|- During the day, you switch it off...
{133372}{133454}and you can claim it as reasonable wear|and tear under "allowable expenses"...
{133477}{133524}under paragraph 335...
{133537}{133611}Yes. l follow.|But, you see, the snag is...
{133632}{133690}if l now call the service|and say to them...
{133707}{133810}"l've got a 45-year-old accountant|who wants to become a lion tamer"...
{133838}{133935}their first question is not going to be|"Does he have his own hat?"
{133962}{134061}They're more likely to ask|what experience you've had with lions.
{134087}{134175}- l've seen'em at the zoo.|- Good.
{134200}{134297}Little brown, furry creatures with|short, stumpy legs and great long noses.
{134322}{134387}I could tame one of those.|l don't know what all the fuss is about.
{134406}{134458}Look pretty tame|to start with.
{134473}{134537}And these lions,|how high are they?
{134556}{134651}Oh, about so high .|They don't frighten me at all.
{134677}{134730}And do these Iions eat ants?
{134746}{134792}Yes, that's right.
{134842}{134969}Well, l'm afraid what you've got hold of|there, Mr. Anchovy, is an anteater.
{135003}{135080}- A what?|- An anteater, not a lion.
{135102}{135159}You see a lion,|is a huge savage beast...
{135176}{135228}about ten-foot long,|five-foot high...
{135243}{135302}with masses of sharp,|pointy teeth...
{135318}{135371}and nasty, long,|razor-sharp claws.
{135387}{135436}lt looks like this.
{135512}{135599}- Now. shall I caIl the circus?|- No!
{135622}{135694}l like your idea|of making the move...
{135713}{135762}to lion taming|by easy stages...
{135777}{135847}say by insurance|or banking.
{135867}{135925}- Banking?|- Yes, banking. l see it now.
{135942}{135993}It's a man's life, isn't it?|Travel. excitement...
{136007}{136107}decisions affecting people's lives,|romance. thrills.
{136135}{136187}l'll put you in touch|with the bank.
{136273}{136317}Probably.
{136331}{136415}l'd like a couple of days to think|about it, 'cause it is a big decision.
{136438}{136492}Or maybe, maybe a week,|at most, you know?
{136508}{136609}But l do want to make this decision.|l'd like to do banking...
{136637}{136676}lt's sad, isn't it...
{136687}{136761}that this is what|accountancy does to people?
{136782}{136875}The only way that we can fight this|terrible, debilitating social disease...
{136901}{136980}l only want to be famous.|l only want to see my name in lights.
{137002}{137049}And so you shalI.
{137318}{137356}Cue!
{137551}{137610}Hello, good evening,|and welcome to "Blackmail."
{137627}{137713}To start tonight's program,|we go north to Preston in Lancashire...
{137737}{137783}and Mrs. Betty Teal.
{137842}{137956}Hello Mrs. Teal.|Now, Mrs. Teal, this is for $15...
{137987}{138081}and is to stop us revealing|the name of your lover in Bolton.
{138107}{138182}So, Mrs. Teal, send us $15|by return of post, please...
{138203}{138297}and your husband Trevor and your lovely|children Diane. Janice and Juliet...
{138322}{138426}need never know the name|of your lover in Bolton.
{138618}{138694}Now, a letter, a series|of photographs...
{138716}{138797}and a hotel registration book|which could add up to divorce...
{138818}{138888}premature retirement and|possible criminal proceedings...
{138907}{138967}for a company director|in Bromsgrove.
{138983}{139035}He's a Freemason|and a conservative M.P.
{139051}{139139}So, Mr. S. of Bromsgrove,|that's $3,000, please...
{139163}{139271}to stop us revealing your name, the name|of the three other peopIe invoIved...
{139301}{139353}the youth organization|to which they belong...
{139367}{139423}and the shop where|you bought the equipment.
{139666}{139745}Well, we'll be showing you more of that|photograph later in the program...
{139767}{139859}unless we hear|from Charles or Michael.
{139885}{139945}Now it's time for|our "Stop The FiIm" spot.
{139962}{140008}The rules are very simple.
{140022}{140081}We have taken a film which|contains compromising scenes...
{140097}{140196}and unpleasant details|which could wreck a man's career.
{140223}{140301}But the victim may phone me|at any time and stop the fiIm.
{140323}{140399}But don't forget, the money increases|as the film goes on...
{140421}{140492}so the longer you leave it,|the more you have to pay.
{140512}{140630}So, with the clock at  $300 this week's|"Stop the Film" visited Temstead.
{142230}{142286}He's a very brave man.
{142498}{142562}No, sir. No.
{142581}{142643}l'm sure you didn't, sir.|No, that's all right.
{142661}{142729}We don't morally censure.|We just want the money.
{142748}{142798}And here's the address|to send it to:
{142942}{143002}Thank you, sir.
{143091}{143155}Ah. There you are.
{143172}{143231}Well, that's quite|enough of that.
{143247}{143294}And now...
{143396}{143514}a local civic group reenacts|a famous scene from history.
{143546}{143649}This week, the Townswomen Guild|of Sheffield in Yorkshire.
{143677}{143714}Miss Rita Fairbanks...
{143726}{143796}you organized this representation|of the BattIe of Pearl Harbor.
{143816}{143852}Why?
{143863}{143938}Weve always been extremely|interested in modern works.
{143960}{144072}We were the first townswomen's guild|to perform "Camp on Blood lsland"...
{144102}{144141}and, of course, last year...
{144153}{144254}we did our extremely popular|reenactment of Nazi war atrocities...
{144282}{144356}so this year we thought we'd do|something in a much lighter vein.
{144377}{144455}l can see that you're all ready to go,|so l'Il just wish you good luck...
{144477}{144539}in your latest venture,|"The BattIe of Pearl Harbor.''
{144557}{144640}Thank you very much|indeed, young man.
{145478}{145518}Oh, Brian.
{145531}{145577}Oh , Elsbeth.
{145902}{145969}Be gentle with me.
{146972}{147083}Oh , Brian, are you gonna do anything|or just show me films all evening?
{147112}{147152}Just one more, dear.
{147497}{147564}Good afternoon, and welcome|to Brantley Park...
{147582}{147656}just as the competitors are|running out onto the field...
{147677}{147746}on this lovely winter afternoon|with the going firm under foot...
{147766}{147813}and very little sign of rain.
{147827}{147886}Looks like we're in for|a splendid afternoon sport...
{147902}{147997}on this, the 127th|"Upper Class Twit of the Year" show.
{148022}{148109}There's a big crowd here today|to see these prize idiots in action.
{148133}{148170}Vivian Smith Smythe Smith.
{148182}{148234}He's in the Grenadier Guards,|and can count to four.
{148250}{148292}Simon Zinc Trumpet Harris.
{148305}{148375}He's an old Italian and married|to an attractive table lamp.
{148393}{148464}Nigel lncubator Jones.|His best friend is a tree...
{148483}{148536}and in his spare time|he s a stockbroker.
{148552}{148616}Javais Brookhamster.|He's in the wine trade...
{148635}{148693}and his father uses him|as a wastepaper basket.
{148708}{148782}And finally, Oliver Singen Mollusk,|another old ltalian.
{148802}{148876}His father was a cabinet minister|and his mother won the derby.
{148897}{148962}He's thought by many to be|this year's outstanding twit.
{148981}{149051}And now the twits are moving|up to the starting line...
{149071}{149141}and any moment now they'll be|under starter's orders.
{149161}{149207}lm afraid they're facing|the wrong way at the moment...
{149221}{149267}the wrong way at the moment,|but the starter will sort this out.
{149281}{149404}Any moment now they're going to have the|big off. This is always a tense moment.
{149437}{149480}And they're off!
{149492}{149582}No, they're not. They didn't realize|that they had to start with the gun.
{149607}{149687}l think the starter has explained to|them. Several are beginning to point.
{149710}{149768}And ready again,|and off again!
{149783}{149830}This time, yes,|a really fast start!
{149843}{149928}lt's Vivian going for the lead|Oliver's running wide to the right!
{149952}{150016}And to the left but,|he'll soon pick up the line...
{150035}{150101}into the first event which is,|walking along a straight line.
{150120}{150185}The twits have to walk along these lines|without falling over.
{150202}{150264}This is Oliver's worst event.|He's having a little trouble.
{150282}{150352}Simon's coming through.|Nigel's coming through.
{150372}{150450}Oliver's over at the back. Never mind.|He'll get up. He's a great fighter.
{150472}{150520}He's having...|Oh dear, never mind.
{150535}{150605}We're coming to the second event,|the matchbox jump.
{150625}{150710}Two layers of matchboxes for the twits|to clear. Nigel and Simon are over!
{150732}{150783}And Vivian has refused.
{150798}{150853}And now,|it's "Kicking the Beggar. "
{150870}{150968}And Nigel to put the brogue in there!|Oh, beautifully placed!
{150995}{151053}The beggar is down,|and the crowd really loved it!
{151070}{151136}And here it's Oliver.|He hasn't cleared the jump.
{151155}{151211}Oh, if only his father|could understand.
{151227}{151289}And now it's|"Running Over the Old Lady. "
{151307}{151394}Simon in the lead and he's done|it beautifully, right in the midriff.
{151418}{151489}Back to Oliver.|Oh, he's magnificent, this man.
{151508}{151565}He doesn't know when he's beaten. He|doesn't know what he's winning either.
{151582}{151681}He has no sort of sensory apparatus|known to man. Bad luck. Oliver.
{151708}{151780}And now, it's "Waking the Neighbor. "|Simon's there at the front.
{151801}{151907}He's slamming that door, and woken|the neighbor Simon's moved into first.
{151936}{151982}The crowd is really excited!
{151996}{152045}And now it's|"Shooting the Rabbits."
{152060}{152152}These rabbits have been staked to the|ground so they can't move too much...
{152177}{152259}as this is only|a one-day event.
{152282}{152366}There's mist there which l think is|causing the twits a bit of trouble.
{152390}{152453}And Javais is using|the butt of his rifle!
{152471}{152533}Vivian's going in with a fist,|and Javais is first away!
{152551}{152613}And Oliver|has run himself over!
{152631}{152677}What a great twit!
{152691}{152775}And now, it's "Taking the Bras off|the Debutantes from the Back. "
{152798}{152873}This is a particularly difficult|event for most of the twits...
{152895}{152967}one of the ones that takes the most time|on this exacting course.
{152987}{153094}The crowd are getting excited, and I|think the twits are getting excited too.
{153123}{153216}And it's Simon into the lead,|closely followed by Nigel!
{153242}{153292}And it's the final event now!
{153307}{153380}They have to shoot themselves|to become upper class twit of the year.
{153401}{153487}Simon can't get the bra off his finger|it 's Nigel there!
{153511}{153562}Nigel misses!|Simon's missing!
{153577}{153647}Nigel misses again!|And Javais has shot himself!
{153667}{153741}Javais is|upper class twit of the year!
{153762}{153816}Vivian is there!|He's not having any luck!
{153832}{153909}Simon shoots.|Simon has shot Vivian!
{153931}{153995}Simon has shot Vivian|into second place.
{154013}{154079}And Simon shoots himself.|Simon is third.
{154097}{154184}And Nigel clubs himself|into fourth place!
{154207}{154254}And so, the final result:
{154267}{154314}first and upper class|twit of the year...
{154327}{154378}Javais Brookhamster of Kensington...
{154393}{154456}runner up, Vivian Smith Smythe Smith|of Mayfair...
{154475}{154541}and third, Simon Zinc|Trumpet Harris of Kensington.
