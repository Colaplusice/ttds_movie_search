3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:12,720
Ladies and gentlemen, we are about to
begin our descent into Los Angeles.

4
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:16,560
The sound you have just heard is
landing gear locking into place.

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:20,120
The Los Angeles weather is clear,
temperature 72.

6
00:00:20,680 --> 00:00:24,880
We expect to make our four hours
eighteen minutes flight on schedule.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,680
We enjoyed having you on board and look
forward to see you again in the near future.

8
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,960
Attention, please! Passengers in this
area is limited to 3 minutes on leave.

9
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,000
Please do not leave your cart unattended.

10
00:02:54,520 --> 00:02:56,680
Hey, What's the matter?

11
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,600
The guests are all downstairs, Ben.
They're all waiting to see you.

12
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,920
Look, Dad, Could you explain to them
that I have to be alone for a while?

13
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:10,440
These are all our good friends, Ben.

14
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,320
Most of them have known you since -
well - practically since you were born.

15
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:16,880
What is it, Ben?

16
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,440
I'm just -

17
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,560
- worried?

18
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,720
Well -

19
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,520
About what?

20
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,200
I guess - about my future.

21
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,040
What about it?

22
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,040
I don't know.  I want it to be -

23
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,400
To be what?

24
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:47,560
Different.

25
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,000
Is anything wrong?
No, No, we're just on our way downstairs!

26
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,560
The Carlsons' are here.

27
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,840
They are? Come on.

28
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,080
They came all the way from Tarzana.

29
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,520
Come on, let's get cracking.

30
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:04,520
It's a wonderful thing to have
so many devoted friends.

31
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:08,280
Hey - there's our award winning scholar.

32
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,280
We're all very proud of you, Ben.

33
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,120
Thank you, Mrs. Carlson.

34
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,880
Is that the new car out there?
The little red Wop job?

35
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,400
That's Ben's graduation present.

36
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,040
Won't have much trouble picking
them up in that, will you?

37
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:16,880
So?

38
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,920
The girls, the chicks, the teeny boppers.

39
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,760
I think Ben has gotten beyond the
teeny bopper stage. Haven't you, Ben?

40
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:22,640
Yes, madam.

41
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,840
Excuse me. I think I'd just like to
check something on the car for a minute.

42
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:33,600
Here's the track star.
How are you, track star?

43
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,840
Just fine, Mr. Loomis.

44
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,360
I want to get a drink and then I want
to hear all about that thing you won.
That Hoppermanaward.

45
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,120
Helpingham.

46
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:41,720
Helpingham! Right! You wait right here.

47
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:53,680
Ben - we're all so proud of you.
Proud, proud, proud, proud, proud.

48
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,840
What are you going to do now?

49
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,520
I was going to go upstairs for a minute -

50
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
No - I meant with your future, Your life.

51
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:02,040
Well - that's a little hard to say -

52
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,000
Ben!

53
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,880
Excuse me.
Mr. McQuire

54
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,800
Ben.

55
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,040
Mr. McQuire.

56
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,200
Come on with me for a minute.
I want to talk to you.

57
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:14,800
Excuses, John.

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,760
I just want to say on word to you,
just one word.

59
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,040
Yes, sir.

60
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,840
Are you listening?
Yes I am.

61
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,880
Plastics.

62
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,440
Exactly how do you mean?

63
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,040
There is a great future in plastics.
Think about it. Will you think about it?

64
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:45,880
Yes, I will.

65
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,680
Enough said. That's a deal.

66
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:53,920
Here he is now. Here's Ben.
Excuse me just a minute -

67
00:05:55,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Listen everybody, I want you all be quite.

68
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:03,760
I got Ben's college book here. I just want
we enjoy some wonderful things about Ben.

69
00:06:04,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Be quiet, Please!

70
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:09,800
Captain of the cross country team
Head of the bating court

71
00:06:09,880 --> 00:06:15,120
Associate editor of the college news paper
"New Junior here", Manager of "Junior and Senior"

72
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:53,240
Oh. I guess this isn't the bathroom, is it?

73
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,920
It's down the hall.

74
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:57,160
How are you, Benjamin?

75
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:02,200
Fine, thank you, Mrs Robinson.
The bathroom is down at the end of the hall.

76
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,520
Such a pleasent room.

77
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:09,880
Look, Mrs. Robinson, I don't mean
to be rude but, I am -

78
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,040
Is there an ashtray, thank you?

79
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:14,400
No.

80
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:17,560
Oh - I forgot. The track star doesn't smoke.

81
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,160
Is it a girl?

82
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,680
Is what a girl?

83
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,640
Whatever it is upsetting you.

84
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:38,000
Oh - no. I'm just sort of disturbed
about things. In general.

85
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
That's right.

86
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:46,240
Well, congratulations!
Thank you!

87
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:53,840
Oh, Benjamin, I want to ask you something.
What?

88
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,640
Will you take me home?
What?

89
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,560
My husband took the car.
Will you drive me home?

90
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:03,720
Here, you take it.
Do you know how to work a foreign shift?

91
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:08,040
You don't?
No.

92
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:13,480
Let's go.

93
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,760
Thank you.
Right.

94
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,440
Will you come in, please?
What?

95
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,040
I like you to come in till
I get the lights on.

96
00:09:04,040 --> 00:09:04,680
What for?

97
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:07,120
Because I don't feel safe
until I get the lights on.

98
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:26,440
Would you mind walking ahead of
me to the sun porch.

99
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:29,520
I feel funny about
coming into a dark house.

100
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,200
But it's light there.
Please.

101
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,920
What do you drink? Bourbon?

102
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:02,640
Look, Mrs Robinson, I drove you home.
I was glad to do it.

103
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,920
But I have some things on my mind.
Can you understand that?

104
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,720
Yes.
All right.

105
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:08,880
What do you drink?

106
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:15,480
Benjamin - I'm sorry to be this way, but
I don't want to be left alone in this house.

107
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,160
Why not?
Please wait till my husband gets home.

108
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,320
When is he coming back?
I don't know.

109
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,280
Drink?
No.

110
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,360
Are you always this much
afraid of being alone?
Yes.

111
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:33,440
Well, why can't you just lock
the doors and go to bed?

112
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,440
I'm very nuerotic.

113
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:50,840
May I ask you a question?

114
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,840
What do you think of me?

115
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:55,760
What do you mean?

116
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:59,280
You've known me nearly all of your life.
You must have formed some opinion.

117
00:11:00,680 --> 00:11:03,520
Well - I've always thought that
you were a very - nice - person.

118
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,720
Did you know I was an alcoholic?

119
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:13,400
What?
Did you know that?

120
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:17,040
Look - I think I should be going.

121
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:18,840
Sit down, Benjamin.

122
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:21,000
Mrs. Robinson, if you don't mind my saying so,

123
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,920
this conversation is getting a little strange.

124
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:25,600
Now I'm sure that Mr. Robinson will
be here any minute and...

125
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,640
No.
What?

126
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,720
My husband will be back quite late.
He should be gone for several hours.

127
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:33,640
Oh my God.

128
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,720
Pardon?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson, oh no.

129
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:38,160
What's wrong?

130
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,320
Mrs. Robinson, you didn't -
I mean you didn't expect -

131
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,240
What?

132
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,760
I mean - you didn't really think that
I would do something like that.

133
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,480
Like what?

134
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,880
What do you think?
Well, I don't know.

135
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:52,160
For God's sake, Mrs. Robinson.

136
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,560
Here we are, you've got me into your house.
You give me a drink. You put on music.

137
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:58,960
Now you start opening up
your personal life to me

138
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:00,760
and tell me your husband
won't be home for hours.

139
00:12:00,760 --> 00:12:03,960
So?
Mrs. Robinson, you are
trying to seduce me.

140
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,240
Aren't you?

141
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:12,800
Well, no. I hadn't thought of it.
I feel rather flattered -

142
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,720
Mrs. Robinson, will you forgive
me for what I just said?

143
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:16,120
It's all right.

144
00:12:16,120 --> 00:12:18,040
It's not all right, it's the worst
thing I've ever said to anyone.

145
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:19,000
Sit down.

146
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,360
Please forgive me. Because I like you.

147
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,760
I don't think of you that way. But I'm mixed up.

148
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,360
It's all right. Now finish your drink.

149
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,280
Mrs. Robinson, it makes me sick
that I said that to you.

150
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:30,320
Forget it right now. Finish your drink.

151
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,400
What is wrong with me?
Have you ever seen Elaine's portrait?

152
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,720
Her portrait?
Yes.

153
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:42,720
No.

154
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:46,160
We had it done last Christmas.
Would you like to see it?
Very much.

155
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,000
Here is Elaine's room.

156
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,600
Elaine certainly is an
attractive girl, isn't she?

157
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,800
I don't remember her as having brown eyes.

158
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:07,240
Benjamin?
Yes?

159
00:13:07,640 --> 00:13:12,120
Will you come here a minute?
Over there?sure

160
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:22,000
Will you unzip my dress? I think I'll go to bed.
Oh. Well, goodnight.

161
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,160
Won't you unzip my dress?
I'd rather not, Mrs. Robinson.

162
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:28,720
If you still think I'm trying to seduce you -
No, I don't. But I just feel a little funny.

163
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,560
Benjamin - you've known me all your life.
I know that. But I'm -

164
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,040
Come on. It's hard for me to reach.

165
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,480
Thank you.
Right.

166
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:46,280
What are you so scared of?
I'm not scared, Mrs. Robinson.

167
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,640
Then why do you keep running away?

168
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,960
Because you're going to bed.

169
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:50,280
I don't think I should be up here.

170
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:55,280
Haven't you ever seen anybody in a slip before?
Yes, I have. But I just -

171
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:59,320
Look - what if Mr. Robinson walked in right now?
What if he did?

172
00:13:59,440 --> 00:14:01,040
Well, it would look pretty funny, wouldn't it?

173
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,560
Don't you think he trusts us together?

174
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,480
Of course he does.

175
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:05,240
But he might get the wrong idea.
Anyone might.

176
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:06,120
I don't see why.

177
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:08,320
I'm twice as old as you are.
How could anyone think......

178
00:14:08,320 --> 00:14:10,160
But they would! Don't you see?

179
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:12,000
Benjamin - I'm not trying to seduce you.

180
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:13,840
I know that. But please, Mrs. Robinson.

181
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,120
This is difficult for me.

182
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:17,600
Would you like me to seduce you?
What?

183
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:19,840
Is that what you're trying to tell me?

184
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
I'm going home now.
I apologize for what I said.

185
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,400
I hope you can forget it.

186
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,920
But I'm going home right now.

187
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,000
Benjamin?
Yes.

188
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,320
Will you bring up my purse before you go?
I have to go now. I'm sorry.

189
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,760
I really don't want to put this on again.
Won't you bring it up?

190
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:38,240
Where is it?
On the table in the hall.

191
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,520
Mrs. Robinson?
I'm in the bathroom.

192
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:46,880
Well here's the purse.

193
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:48,240
Could you bring it up?

194
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,040
Well I'll hand it to you. Come to
the railing and I'll hand it up.

195
00:14:52,040 --> 00:14:54,440
Benjamin - I am getting pretty
tired of all this suspicion.

196
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:56,080
Now if you won't do me a simple favor,

197
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,440
I don't know what.

198
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm putting it on the top step.

199
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:04,720
For God's sake, Benjamin, will you stop
acting that way and bring me the purse?

200
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,160
I'm putting it here by the door.

201
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,760
Will you bring it in to me?
I'd rather not.

202
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:17,360
All right. Put it in Elaine's room where we were.
Right.

203
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:30,720
Oh, God!
Let me out!

204
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,920
Don't be nervous.
Get away from that door.

205
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:34,720
Let me say something first.
Jesus Christ!

206
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
Benjamin, I want you to know
I'm available to you.

207
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:38,200
If you want sleep with me this time.

208
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:38,800
Oh my Christ!

209
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,080
If you want sleep with me this time

210
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,400
I want you to know you can call me up any time
you want and we'll make some kind of arrangement.

211
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,760
Do you understand what I said?
Let me out!

212
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,520
Benjamin, Do you understand what I said?
Yes. Yes. Let me out!

213
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:51,480
Because I find you very attractive
and any time you want-

214
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,440
Oh, Jesus!

215
00:16:03,880 --> 00:16:06,800
Is that Ben's car in front?
Yes, Sir!

216
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:13,320
I drove - I drove Mrs. Robinson home.
She wanted me to drive her home so I -
I drove her home.

217
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:15,760
Well. I appreciate it.

218
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:20,000
She's upstairs. She wanted me to
wait down here till you got home.

219
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:24,600
Standing guard over the old castle, are you?
Yes, sir.

220
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,440
Congratulations!
Thank you!

221
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:33,520
It looks like you need a refill.
Oh no. I got to go home.

222
00:16:33,800 --> 00:16:38,320
Is anything wrong? You look a little shaken up.

223
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,400
No. No - I'm just - I'm just a little worried about
my future. I'm a little upset about my future.

224
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:47,160
Come on. Let's have a nightcap together.

225
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:49,840
Scotch?
Bourbon.

226
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:57,520
Ben - how old are you now?

227
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:00,760
20. I'll be 21 next week.

228
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:13,680
That's a hell of a good age to be.

229
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:19,560
Thank you.
Thank you very much!

230
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:33,560
I wish I was that age again. Because, Ben -
Sir?

231
00:17:35,080 --> 00:17:38,640
You'll never be young again.
I know.

232
00:17:45,760 --> 00:17:49,880
Ben, can I say something to you?
What?

233
00:17:52,440 --> 00:17:56,520
How long have we known each other now?

234
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:07,120
How long have you and I known each other?
How long have your Dad and I been partners?
Quite a while.

235
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:16,920
I've watched you grow up, Ben.
Yes, sir.

236
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:23,040
In many ways I feel as though
you were my own son.

237
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,520
Thank you.

238
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:34,560
So I hope you won't mind my giving
you a friendly piece of advice.

239
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,920
I'd like to hear it.

240
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:50,600
Ben - I think - I think you ought to be taking it
a little easier right now than you seem to be.

241
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:58,640
Sow a few wild oats. Take things as they come.
Have a good time with the girls and so forth.

242
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,240
Don't get up.

243
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:14,280
I was just telling Ben here he ought to sow
a few wild oats. Have a good time while
he can. You think that's sound advice?

244
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:15,240
Yes, I do.

245
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,200
I've got to go.

246
00:19:18,760 --> 00:19:25,880
You have yourself a few fillings this summer.
I bet you're quite a ladies' man.

247
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,640
Oh no.

248
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:36,720
What? You look to me like the kind of guy that
has to fight them off. Doesn't he look to you
like the kind of guy who has to fight them off?

249
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:37,920
Yes, he does.

250
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:43,600
Oh say - Elaine gets down
from Berkeley on Saturday.
Oh yes.

251
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,840
I wish you give her a call.
I will.

252
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:51,280
Benjamin? Benjamin?
Yes.

253
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:54,800
Thank you for taking me home.
I'll see you soon, I hope.

254
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:03,000
Ladies and gentlemen, your attention, please
for this afternoon's feature attraction.

255
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:08,160
Hey, over there! Yes, I mean you!
Your attention please!

256
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:14,120
Are you ready in there, feature attraction?
Could I speak to you for a second, Dad?

257
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:19,280
Listen, I'm going to ask a big round of applause
to bring this boy out here, all right?

258
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:27,280
Wait a minute, let me amend that, to bring this young
man out here, because today he is 21 years old.

259
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:30,320
Come on, let's get on with the show!

260
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:32,240
Hang on a minute, I got a few words to say -

261
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:35,720
You always do.
ah, ah! what's talking

262
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,040
Dad, could we just talk about this for a second?

263
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:41,640
I can't hold them much longer, Ben.
You better get out here.

264
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,440
I'd like to discuss this.

265
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,240
This boy - I'm sorry - this young man -
is soon to continue his education

266
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:52,400
as a Frank Halpingham Award Scholar

267
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:54,960
But before he does - before he does -

268
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:59,240
You're disappointing them, Ben.
You're disappointing them.

269
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:00,440
Dad - can you listen -

270
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:03,400
I'll give you ten seconds

271
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:06,720
He is going to give us a practical
demonstration of what I feel safe

272
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,480
in saying is a pretty exciting birthday present

273
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,080
And it better work or I'm out
over two hundred bucks.

274
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,760
Ok, let's herald now for - Benjamin Braddock!

275
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:25,080
Come on, let's herald now!

276
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:29,120
Folks, this remarkable young man is going to
perform for you some spectacular and amazing
feats of daring in water that is over 6 feet deep.

277
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:32,520
is going to perform for you some spectacular

278
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:38,160
and amazing feats of daring in water
that is over 6 feet deep

279
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:26,400
Hello.

280
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:31,840
I don't quite know how to put this -
Benjamin?

281
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:36,920
Look, I was thinking about that time after the party -

282
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:37,800
Where are you?

283
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:40,480
I was wondering if I could
buy you a drink or something.

284
00:23:40,480 --> 00:23:41,360
Where are you?

285
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:45,080
Uh - The Taft Hotel.
Did you get a room?

286
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:51,600
No. Now I know it's pretty
late and if you'd rather -
Give me an hour.

287
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,920
What?
I'll be there in an hour.

288
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:23,880
Can I help you, sir!

289
00:25:24,440 --> 00:25:29,160
What?  Oh - no - I'm just -
Are you here for an affair, sir?

290
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,560
What?
The Singleman party, sir?

291
00:25:34,560 --> 00:25:38,840
Oh - yes.  The Singleman party.
It's in the main ballroom.

292
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,680
Ahh - thank you.

293
00:25:57,040 --> 00:25:58,880
Hello.
Hello.

294
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,840
You must be one of the Poets.
No - actually I'm not -

295
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:04,360
I'd like you to know my sister,
Miss DeWitte -

296
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,640
How do you do?
How do you do, Miss DeWitte?

297
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:08,000
- and my husband, Mr. Singleman -

298
00:26:08,000 --> 00:26:09,920
Oh, sorry.
Fine, thank you.

299
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,760
That's Jeffrey, of course.
Of course.

300
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,320
I didn't get your name, sir.
Benjamin Braddock, sir.

301
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:17,200
Braddock - Braddock?
Yes, but I'm afraid -

302
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:22,120
I'll find your table in a moment.
Braddock. Not Braniff? We have a Braniff.

303
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:25,720
No - actually I'm just
looking for a friend.

304
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:29,080
Oh, but I don't understand.
I'm not with your party - I'm sorry.

305
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:33,680
Hey - I don't get it.
I've enjoyed meeting you, Mr. Braniff.

306
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,880
Hello, Benjamin.
Oh. Hello.

307
00:27:24,920 --> 00:27:27,800
May I sit down?
Of course.

308
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,000
Thank you.

309
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,240
How are you?
Very well. Thank you.

310
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,680
May I have a drink?
A drink?  Of course.

311
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,720
He didn't see me.

312
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:48,320
Waiter! I will have a martini.
Yes, madam.

313
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,400
You don't have to be
so nervous, you know.

314
00:27:53,480 --> 00:27:55,960
Nervous. Well, I am a bit nervous.

315
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:58,840
I mean it's - it's pretty hard
to be suave when you're -

316
00:27:59,160 --> 00:28:01,240
Did you get us a room?
What?

317
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:03,840
Have you gotten us a room yet?
I haven't. No.

318
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:09,680
Do you want to?
Well, I don't. I mean I could or we could just talk.

319
00:28:10,360 --> 00:28:14,000
Do you want me to get it?
You? Oh no. No, I'll get it.

320
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,080
Do you want to get it now?

321
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:18,240
-Now?
-Yes.

322
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:22,440
Well - I don't know.
Why don't you get it.

323
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:25,800
Why don't I get it? Well, I will then.
If you'll excuse me.

324
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,280
Yes sir?

325
00:28:46,520 --> 00:28:48,640
A room. I'd like a room, please.

326
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:50,440
Single room or double room?

327
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:52,560
A single. Just for myself, please.

328
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,160
Will you sign the register, please?

329
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:01,560
Is anything wrong, sir?
What? No, Nothing.

330
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:12,520
Do you have any luggage, Mister -- Gladstone?

331
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,760
Luggage?  Yes.  Yes.  I do.

332
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,680
Where is it?
What?

333
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,240
Where is your luggage?

334
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:24,600
Well it's in the car. It's out in the car.
Very good, sir. I'll have a porter bring it in.

335
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:31,000
-Oh no. I mean I'd rather not go
to the trouble of bringing it all in.

336
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:34,440
I just have a toothbrush.
I can get it myself. If that's all right.

337
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:37,360
Of course.
I'll have a porter show you the room.

338
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:40,880
Oh. Well actually, I'd just as soon find it myself.

339
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:45,200
I just have the toothbrush to carry up
and I think I can manage it myself.

340
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,280
Whatever you say, sir.
Thank you!

341
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,000
Mrs. Robinson.
Yes?

342
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,320
For you.
Thank you.

343
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:02,400
Hello?

344
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,120
Mrs. Robinson?
Yes?

345
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:06,200
It's Benjamin.
Yes?

346
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:07,840
Benjamin Braddock.

347
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:10,120
Benjamin, where are you?

348
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,800
Can you look through the glass.

349
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:19,440
Can you see me now?
Yes, I can.

350
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:22,640
I got a single room.
That's fine.

351
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:26,320
But there's one thing. The desk clerk
seemed to be a little bit suspicious.

352
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:28,760
I don't know what their policy is.

353
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:30,200
Well - do you want to go up first?

354
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:31,600
Yes - I think that would be good.

355
00:30:31,720 --> 00:30:33,080
I'll be up in five minutes.

356
00:30:33,160 --> 00:30:34,240
Well - goodbye then -

357
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,120
Benjamin.
Yes?

358
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:37,880
Isn't there something
you want to tell me?

359
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,280
To tell you?
Yes.

360
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:44,200
Well, I want you to know how
much I appreciate this, really.

361
00:30:44,200 --> 00:30:45,920
The room number.
What?

362
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:48,320
The room number, Benjamin.
I think you ought to tell me that.

363
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,880
Oh? You're absolutely right.

364
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,120
It's 562.
Thank you.

365
00:30:55,520 --> 00:31:01,840
You're welcome. Well - I'll see
you later, Mrs. Robinson.

366
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:10,600
Check, please.

367
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:13,640
I've got it.

368
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:15,640
I say I've got it.
Sir?

369
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,040
The toothbrush. I got it all right.
Very good, sir.

370
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:20,960
Yes.  Well - goodnight.
Goodnight, sir.

371
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,200
Hello, Benjamin.
Hello, Mrs Robinson.

372
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:51,600
Benjamin.
Yes?

373
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:54,400
I'll get undressed now. Is that all right?
Sure.

374
00:33:54,920 --> 00:34:00,240
Shall I - I mean shall I just stand here?
I mean - I don't know what you want me to do.

375
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,520
Why don't you watch?
Oh, sure. Thank you.

376
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:04,640
Will you bring me a hanger?
What?

377
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,920
A hanger.
Oh, yes.

378
00:34:13,200 --> 00:34:15,200
Wood?
What?

379
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,400
Wood or wire?  They have both.

380
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,960
Either one will be fine.
Okay.

381
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:30,600
Thank you!

382
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:40,520
Will you help me with this, please?
Certainly.

383
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:46,080
Thank you.
You're welcome.

384
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:07,440
Benjamin, Would this be
easier for you in the dark?

385
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,840
Mrs. Robinson - I can't do this.
You what?

386
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,280
This is all terribly wrong.

387
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,080
Do you find me undesirable?
Oh no, Mrs. Robinson.

388
00:35:14,080 --> 00:35:16,480
I think - I think you're the most
attractive of all my parents' friends.

389
00:35:16,480 --> 00:35:18,960
I mean that. I found you desirable, but I-

390
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,240
For god's sake, can you
imange my parents?

391
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:24,240
Can you imange what they will say if
they just saw we are in this room like now?

392
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:26,400
What will they say?
I have no idea, Mrs. Robinson.

393
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,000
But for god's sake.

394
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:30,080
They brought me up, they
made a good life for me.

395
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,720
And I think they deserve better than this.

396
00:35:31,720 --> 00:35:34,600
I think they deserve a little better than
jumping into bed with their partner's wife.

397
00:35:34,680 --> 00:35:37,600
Are you afraid of me?
Oh, no, you are missing the point.

398
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:43,480
Look, maybe we could do something else together.
Mrs. Robinson, would you like to go to a movie.

399
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:49,080
Can I ask you a personal question?
I should do anything you want.

400
00:35:49,080 --> 00:35:51,400
Is this your first time?
Is this - what?

401
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,680
It is, isn't it?
It is your first time.

402
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:56,400
That's a laugh, Mrs. Robinson.
That's really a laugh. Ha ha.

403
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:59,080
You can admit that, can't you?
Are you kidding?

404
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:01,240
It's nothing to be ashamed of -
Wait a minute!

405
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,960
On your first time -
Who said it was my first time.

406
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:03,920
that you're afraid -
Wait a minute.

407
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:06,040
- of bring - inadequate -  I mean just because
you happen to be inadequate in one way -

408
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:07,000
INADEQUATE!

409
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:12,960
Don't move.

410
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,840
Ben - what are you doing?

411
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,200
Well - I would say that I'm just
drifting. - here - in the pool.

412
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,160
Why?

413
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,800
Well - it's very comfortable -
just to drift here.

414
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,000
Have you thought about graduate school?
No.

415
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:20,240
Would you  mind telling me then -

416
00:41:20,240 --> 00:41:24,240
what were those four years of
college for?  What was the point
of all that hard work?

417
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:25,800
You got me.

418
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,600
Now listen, Ben.

419
00:41:31,680 --> 00:41:36,280
I think it's a very good thing that a young
man - after he's done some very good work -

420
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,880
should have a chance to relax and enjoy himself,

421
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:42,880
and lie around, and drink beer and so on.

422
00:41:43,720 --> 00:41:45,640
But after a few weeks

423
00:41:45,840 --> 00:41:50,520
I believe that person would want to take
some stock in himself and his situation

424
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,920
and start to think about
getting off his ass.

425
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,320
The Robinson's are here.

426
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:01,600
Hi, Ben.  What are you doing
with yourself these days?

427
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:05,120
Oh, not too much. Taking it easy.

428
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:09,240
That's what I'd do if I could.
Nothing wrong with that.

429
00:42:10,120 --> 00:42:12,960
Hey, Ben, Elaine's coming
down from Berkeley soon.

430
00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:15,840
I want you to call her up this time.
I will.

431
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,720
Because I just think you two would
hit it off real well together.

432
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,800
Say hello to Mrs. Robinson, Benjamin.

433
00:42:25,080 --> 00:42:28,440
Hello, Mrs. Robinson.
Hello, Benjamin.

434
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,920
Can I talk to you for a minute?
Sure.

435
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:51,720
Benjamin, Darling.
I'm going to ask you something

436
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:54,800
but you don't have to tell me
if you don't want to.

437
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:56,320
What?

438
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,720
Well I'm going to ask you what
you do when you go off at night.

439
00:43:02,560 --> 00:43:03,480
When I go off?

440
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:06,400
You don't have to tell me if
you don't want to.

441
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,400
No, I do. I want to tell you.

442
00:43:09,480 --> 00:43:11,400
I drive around.

443
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:14,360
What else?
Nothing else.

444
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:18,000
Well you don't drive around from midnight
until noon the next day, Benjamin.

445
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:18,960
Oh, no.

446
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,400
Then what do you do? Do you meet someone?

447
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:25,360
Meet someone?
Why did you say that?

448
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:27,880
Well this is your business,
I won't play games.

449
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:32,200
No wait. Wait, I don't meet anyone,
Mother. But why did you say that?

450
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:35,720
Benjamin, I don't want to pry
into your affairs,

451
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:38,920
but I'd rather you didn't say
anything at all than be dishonest.

452
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,000
Goodnight.
Well, wait.

453
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:42,080
Wait a minute.

454
00:43:42,160 --> 00:43:44,080
Will you wait a minute, please?

455
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:52,720
Mrs. Robinson, do you think we could say
a few words to each other first this time?

456
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:55,800
I don't think we have much
to say to each other.

457
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,000
Look, for a month, all we ever do is to
come up here and leap into bed together.

458
00:44:05,480 --> 00:44:06,920
Are you tired of it?

459
00:44:07,040 --> 00:44:12,000
I'm not. No. But do you think
we could liven it up with a
conversation for change?

460
00:44:12,160 --> 00:44:13,640
Well what do you want to talk about?

461
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:15,560
Anything.  Anything at all.

462
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:19,320
Do you want to tell me about
some of your college experiences?

463
00:44:19,560 --> 00:44:21,000
Oh my God.

464
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,680
Think of another topic.

465
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,720
How about art.

466
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,000
Art. That's a good subject.

467
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,040
You start it off.

468
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:43,840
You start it off. I don't know
anything about it.

469
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:45,840
What do you want
to know about it.

470
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:48,440
Are you interested more in modern
art or more in classical art.

471
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Neither.

472
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:51,520
You're not interested in art?
No.

473
00:44:51,520 --> 00:44:53,520
Then why do you want to talk about it?
I don't.

474
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,520
Now look, we are going to do this thing.
we are going to have a conversation.

475
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,520
Tell me what you did today.

476
00:45:00,880 --> 00:45:01,880
I got up.

477
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:04,960
I fixed breakfast for my husband.

478
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:05,880
There!

479
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,040
There's something we could have
a conversation about Your husband!

480
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:10,880
Him?

481
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,680
I mean everything. I don't know
anything about how you work this.

482
00:45:14,680 --> 00:45:17,120
What do you say to him when
you leave the house at night?

483
00:45:17,240 --> 00:45:18,640
Nothing. He's asleep.

484
00:45:18,840 --> 00:45:21,720
Always? Doesn't he wake up
when you come home?

485
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:25,360
We have seperated bedrooms.

486
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:31,440
So you don't - I mean I don't
like to seem like I'm prying

487
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:34,880
but I guess you don't sleep
together or anything.
No we don't.

488
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:36,680
Well how long has
this been going on.

489
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:39,920
Forgot it.
Wait a minute,  Why do you hurry?

490
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:42,160
See if you can guess.

491
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:43,480
Well I can't.

492
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,880
Think real hard, Benjamin.

493
00:45:45,880 --> 00:45:48,320
I can't see why you did, unless

494
00:45:48,840 --> 00:45:51,240
You didn't have to marry
him or anything, did you?

495
00:45:59,320 --> 00:46:00,720
Don't tell Elaine.

496
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:03,920
Oh no.  You had to marry him
because you got pregnant?

497
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:05,560
Are you shocked?

498
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,800
Well I never thought of you and Mr.
Robinson as the kind of people who...

499
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,720
Oh, I know. Let's get to bed.

500
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:14,400
Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.

501
00:46:15,440 --> 00:46:17,240
So how did it happen?

502
00:46:17,360 --> 00:46:18,360
What?

503
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:22,200
Mrs. Robinson, I mean do you feel like telling me
what were the circumstances?

504
00:46:22,600 --> 00:46:24,120
Not particularly.

505
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,800
Was he a law student at the time?

506
00:46:27,880 --> 00:46:29,800
And you were a student also.

507
00:46:32,120 --> 00:46:35,000
At college.
Yes.

508
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,080
What was your major?

509
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:44,320
Benjamin, why are you asking
me all these questions?

510
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:46,480
Because I'm interested, Mrs. Robinson.

511
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:52,000
Now what was your
major subject at college?
Art.

512
00:46:52,120 --> 00:46:53,120
Art?

513
00:46:54,760 --> 00:46:56,680
But I thought you...

514
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:05,040
I guess you kind of lost interest
in it over the years then.

515
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:07,880
Kind of.

516
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,600
Well how did it happen?

517
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,000
What?
You and Mr. Robinson.

518
00:47:15,760 --> 00:47:16,680
How do you think.

519
00:47:16,800 --> 00:47:18,360
I mean did he take you
up to his room with him?

520
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:20,120
Did you go to a hotel?

521
00:47:20,120 --> 00:47:22,560
Benjamin, what does
it possibly matter?

522
00:47:22,560 --> 00:47:23,720
I'm curious.

523
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:25,640
We'd go to his car.

524
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:28,880
Oh no. In the car you did it?

525
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:30,880
I don't think we were the first.

526
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,600
What kind of car was it?
What?

527
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:38,080
Do you remember the
make of the car?

528
00:47:38,160 --> 00:47:40,840
Oh my God.
Really. I want to know.

529
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,880
It was a Ford, Benjamin.

530
00:47:43,520 --> 00:47:49,280
A Ford!  A Ford!  God damn it,
That's great! a Ford!

531
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,120
That's enough.

532
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:57,840
So old Elaine Robinson
got started in a Ford.

533
00:47:59,000 --> 00:48:00,800
Don't talk about Elaine.

534
00:48:01,120 --> 00:48:02,440
Don't talk about Elaine?

535
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:05,800
No.
Why not?

536
00:48:06,480 --> 00:48:08,080
Because I don't want you to.

537
00:48:08,080 --> 00:48:09,640
Why don't you?

538
00:48:09,840 --> 00:48:11,280
I wish you'd tell me.

539
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:12,800
There's nothing to tell.

540
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,880
Well why is she a big taboo
subject all of a sudden?

541
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:21,000
Well - I guess I'll have to ask her out on a date
and find out what the problem is.

542
00:48:21,000 --> 00:48:26,520
Benjamin, don't you ever take that
girl out. Do you understand that?

543
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:28,440
Well look. I have no
intention of taking her out.

544
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:32,360
Good.

545
00:48:33,040 --> 00:48:34,880
I was just kidding around.

546
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:41,480
But why shouldn't I?

547
00:48:45,600 --> 00:48:48,120
I have my reasons.
Then let's hear them.

548
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:50,000
No.
Let's hear your reasons, Mrs. Robinson.

549
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:51,480
Because I think I know what they are.

550
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,400
I'm not good enough for her
to associate with, am I?

551
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,560
I'm not good enough to
even talk about her, am I?

552
00:48:56,800 --> 00:48:58,720
Let's drop it.
We're not dropping it.

553
00:48:58,840 --> 00:49:01,400
I'm good enough for you but I'm too
slimy to associate with your daughter.

554
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:04,320
That's it, isn't it? ISN'T IT?

555
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:21,760
Yes
You go to hell. You go straight
to hell, Mrs. Robinson.

556
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,440
Do you think I'm proud of myself?
Do you think I'm proud of this?

557
00:49:24,440 --> 00:49:26,200
I wouldn't know.
Well, I'm not.

558
00:49:27,120 --> 00:49:31,440
No sir. I am not proud that I spend my time
with a brokendown alcoholic!

559
00:49:32,320 --> 00:49:33,240
I see.

560
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:35,920
And if you think I come here for
any reason besides pure boredom,

561
00:49:35,960 --> 00:49:37,400
then you're all wrong.

562
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,600
Because, Mrs. Robinson, this is the sickest,
most perverted thing that ever happened to me.

563
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:44,000
And you do what you want
but I'm getting the hell out.

564
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,360
Are you?
You're goddamn right I am.

565
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:53,440
That's how you feel about me.
That I'm a sick and disgusting person.

566
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,720
I won't start this.

567
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,360
What?
Don't start acting hurt.

568
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,720
Don't you expect me
to be a little hurt?

569
00:49:59,720 --> 00:50:03,280
Mrs. Robinson, you lie here and tell me
I'm not good enough for your daughter.

570
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:04,960
Did I say that?

571
00:50:05,080 --> 00:50:06,760
In some other words.

572
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:12,120
Benjamin, I want to apologize to you
if that's the impression you got.

573
00:50:12,120 --> 00:50:14,760
Well two minutes ago you told me
I wasn't good enough for your daughter.

574
00:50:14,960 --> 00:50:17,200
Now you say you're sorry
I got that impression.

575
00:50:17,480 --> 00:50:21,200
I didn't mean it.  I don't think
you'd be right for each other.

576
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:24,760
But I would never say you weren't
as good a person as she is.

577
00:50:25,640 --> 00:50:29,480
You wouldn't.
Of course I wouldn't.

578
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,320
What are you doing?

579
00:50:35,720 --> 00:50:38,600
Well it's pretty obvious you
don't want me around any more.

580
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:47,200
Well look -
I was kind of upset there.

581
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,680
I'm sorry I said those things.

582
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:55,360
That's all right. I think I can
understand why I'm disgusting to you.

583
00:50:56,240 --> 00:51:02,960
Oh no. Look, I like you.
I wouldn't keep coming here if I didn't like you.

584
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:06,600
But if it's sickening for you -
It's not!

585
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:13,680
I enjoy it! I look forward to it. It's the
one thing I have to look forward to.

586
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,200
You don't have to say that.

587
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:21,160
Well I wouldn't. I would
never say it if it wasn't true.

588
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:23,600
May I stay then?

589
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:28,200
Yes. Please. I want you to.

590
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:30,360
Thank you.

591
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:33,640
Well don't thank me,
because I want you to.

592
00:51:35,240 --> 00:51:39,080
But you won't ever take out Elaine, will you?
I want you to promise me with that.

593
00:51:39,760 --> 00:51:43,600
Look. Why the hell did you bring this up.
It never occured to me to take her out.

594
00:51:43,600 --> 00:51:45,080
Then give me your word you won't.

595
00:51:46,280 --> 00:51:49,680
This is absurd.
Promise me, Benjamin.

596
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:53,000
All right, I promise, for christ's sake.

597
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,200
I promise I will never take
out Elaine Robinson.

598
00:51:57,800 --> 00:51:58,760
Thank you.

599
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:06,000
Benjanmin.
Let's not talk about it.

600
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:09,320
Let's not talk at all.

601
00:52:44,280 --> 00:52:45,520
Elaine's back from school.

602
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,600
I think it might be a nice gesture
if you asked her out.

603
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:05,320
Suppose she's not good
enough for you, is that it?

604
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,680
Look - Elaine Robinson and I
do not get along.

605
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:09,920
How do you know?
You haven't seen her since high school.

606
00:53:10,680 --> 00:53:14,840
Suppose
your evenings, whatever
you do with them, are just too valuable.

607
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:16,240
That has nothing to do with it -

608
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,680
I guess I'll just tell Mr. Robinson

609
00:53:18,680 --> 00:53:22,520
that you're just too busy every
evening - doing God knows what -

610
00:53:22,520 --> 00:53:24,440
Don't go on like this.

611
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:28,720
If Benjamin absolutely
refuses to take her out -
I do.

612
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:33,880
- then I'll simply invite all the
Robinsons' over on Thursday.

613
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:48,200
Well, Braddock - it's about
time you got around to this.

614
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:03,720
Hello.

615
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:10,680
Come on in. I'm afraid the young
lady isn't quite ready yet.

616
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,360
What would you say to a short one?

617
00:54:13,360 --> 00:54:16,160
Scotch still your drink?
Bourbon.

618
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,320
I'll see if she's ready.

619
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:47,120
Now listen, this was not my
idea. It was my father's idea.

620
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,200
Benjamin, I thought I made myself
perfectly clear about this.

621
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:53,520
Look, we'll go out to dinner and
have a drink and I'll bring her back.

622
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,640
Because it was either that or a
dinner party for the two families.

623
00:54:56,640 --> 00:54:59,040
And I'm afriad I couldn't quite
handle that, if you don't mind.

624
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:04,240
Look, I have no intention of ever taking
your precious daughter out again in her life.

625
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:05,680
So don't get upset about it.

626
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,600
But I am. I'm extremely
upset about it, Benjamin.

627
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:14,000
Hello.
Hello.

628
00:55:14,360 --> 00:55:16,760
Well, I want you to keep your wits about you tonight.

629
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:20,640
You never know what tricks Ben
picked up back there in the East.

630
00:55:31,560 --> 00:55:34,440
You're living at home now. Is that right?
Yes.

631
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:38,280
Do you know what you're going to do?
No.

632
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
Are you going to graduate school?
No.

633
00:55:51,320 --> 00:55:54,400
Do you always drive like this?
Yes.

634
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:16,280
Sit down.

635
00:57:30,680 --> 00:57:32,600
Why don't you watch the show?

636
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:39,480
Benjamin, do you dislike
me for some reason?

637
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:41,280
No - why should I?

638
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:43,840
I don't know.

639
00:57:52,160 --> 00:57:54,560
You're missing a great effect here.

640
00:57:57,520 --> 00:57:58,960
Are you like that?

641
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,480
Could you do it?

642
00:58:25,960 --> 00:58:27,720
Stop.Hey!!!

643
00:58:36,520 --> 00:58:38,000
Elaine, I'm sorry.

644
00:58:41,120 --> 00:58:43,040
Will you take me home now?

645
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,520
I'm sorry I took you in there.

646
00:58:44,840 --> 00:58:46,720
I think I'd better go
home now, please.

647
00:58:53,280 --> 00:58:55,840
Where is the car?
I just want to tell you something.

648
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:02,560
I want to go home.
But could I just tell you this one thing?

649
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,360
What?
This whole idea, this date and everything.
It was my parents' idea.

650
00:59:07,360 --> 00:59:08,680
They forced me into it.

651
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:11,280
Oh - that's very nice of
you to tell me.

652
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,960
No.  What I mean is - that's
why I've been acting this way.

653
00:59:13,960 --> 00:59:16,440
I'm not like this.
I hate myself like this.

654
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:22,680
Listen, could you just stop crying, please?

655
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:24,040
No, I couldn't.

656
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:25,880
But could you try?
No.

657
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:42,120
I've had this feeling ever
since I've graduated.

658
00:59:42,920 --> 00:59:44,920
This kind of compulsion that
I have to be rude all the time.

659
00:59:44,920 --> 00:59:44,080
Do you know what I mean?

660
00:59:48,760 --> 00:59:50,040
Yes, I do.

661
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:52,600
It's like I've been playing
some kind of - game -

662
00:59:52,600 --> 00:59:54,640
but the rudes
don't make any sense to me.

663
00:59:55,480 --> 00:59:57,400
They're being made up
by all the wrong people.

664
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:02,320
No, I mean no one makes them up,
they seem to have made themselves up.

665
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:08,440
Hey - I wonder if I could request
you to turn that down a little?

666
01:00:57,320 --> 01:01:01,160
Would you like to come in?
I could make some coffee.

667
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,920
No, I mean - I wouldn't
want to wake anyone up.

668
01:01:05,680 --> 01:01:08,080
We won't.  Let's go inside.

669
01:01:08,840 --> 01:01:11,240
Wait a minute.
Is anything wrong?

670
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:16,600
No, I was just thinking.
It's still early.

671
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,560
We could do something,
go somewhere else.

672
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:22,200
All right.

673
01:01:29,480 --> 01:01:30,920
Where we going?

674
01:01:31,000 --> 01:01:33,880
I'm trying to think of where there's a place
to have a drink around here.

675
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:35,800
Isn't there one in the Taft Hotel?

676
01:01:37,600 --> 01:01:38,680
What is the matter?

677
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:42,440
Nothing.  I'm just wondering
if they have a bar or not.

678
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:45,760
I mean let's go see. Let's
go see if they do or not.

679
01:01:47,320 --> 01:01:50,280
Listen, Elaine, it seems to me
that there is a bar here.

680
01:01:50,280 --> 01:01:51,240
I mean - as far as I know.

681
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:53,440
Of course there is. Look, the
Veranda Room, right there.

682
01:01:53,440 --> 01:01:54,400
Good evening.

683
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:56,720
Hello, how are you, sir?

684
01:01:56,800 --> 01:01:58,240
Good evening, Mr. Gladstone.

685
01:01:58,920 --> 01:01:59,840
Hello again.

686
01:02:01,520 --> 01:02:04,360
Hi, Mr. Gladstone.
How are you this evening?

687
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:06,880
Benjamin -

688
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:10,040
Let's get out of here, Elaine.
Let's go somewhere else.

689
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,600
Do they know you?
Of course not.

690
01:02:11,680 --> 01:02:12,640
Good evening, sir.

691
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:14,040
Come on, Elaine. We're leaving.

692
01:02:15,960 --> 01:02:17,880
Mr. Gladstone - how are you?

693
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:19,760
Benjamin, what's happening?

694
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:22,200
I don't know. They must think
I look like this guy Gladstone.

695
01:02:22,200 --> 01:02:23,640
Hello, Mr. Brannif.

696
01:02:35,920 --> 01:02:37,360
Elaine, I like you.

697
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:41,800
I like you so much.
Do you believe that?

698
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:47,920
Do you?
Yes.

699
01:02:50,120 --> 01:02:55,400
You're the first - you're the first
thing for so long that I've liked.

700
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,680
The first person
I could stand to be with.

701
01:03:01,360 --> 01:03:03,760
My whole life is such a waste.

702
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:06,520
It's just nothing.

703
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:13,640
I'm sorry.  I'll take you home now.

704
01:03:16,800 --> 01:03:19,200
Benjamin - are you having
an affair with someone?

705
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,080
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
That is not my business.

706
01:03:30,240 --> 01:03:31,640
It just happened.

707
01:03:33,840 --> 01:03:37,200
It was just this thing that happened
along with everything else.

708
01:03:38,440 --> 01:03:40,080
Can you understand that?

709
01:03:41,520 --> 01:03:45,960
Was she married or something?
Yes.

710
01:03:47,120 --> 01:03:50,960
With a family?
Yes. She had a husband and a son.

711
01:03:52,760 --> 01:03:55,440
Did they ever find out?
No.

712
01:03:58,760 --> 01:04:04,160
And it's all over now.
Yes.

713
01:04:11,040 --> 01:04:12,120
I'm glad.

714
01:04:22,560 --> 01:04:25,920
Can we do something tomorrow?
All right.

715
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:29,200
During the day?  We'll go
for a drive or something.

716
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:30,080
Okay.

717
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:32,840
You sure you really want to?
Yes.

718
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:35,800
Because I wouldn't want you to
do it unless you really wanted to!

719
01:04:35,800 --> 01:04:37,840
I do.
You do?

720
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:40,120
Benjamin, I really do.

721
01:05:10,520 --> 01:05:11,760
Drive down the block.

722
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:16,360
Mrs. Robinson, Elaine I have
a date. We're going for a drive.

723
01:05:16,360 --> 01:05:18,280
Do exactly as I say.

724
01:05:25,720 --> 01:05:28,080
Listen to me very carefully, Benjamin

725
01:05:28,400 --> 01:05:32,240
You are not to see Elaine again, ever.
Those are my orders. Is that clear?

726
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:33,160
Mrs. Robinson, do you think -

727
01:05:33,160 --> 01:05:35,280
I can makes things quite unpleasant.

728
01:05:35,280 --> 01:05:36,200
How?

729
01:05:36,840 --> 01:05:40,560
In order to keep Elaine away from you,
I am prepared to tell her everything.

730
01:05:43,600 --> 01:05:45,040
I don't believe you.

731
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:47,640
Then you'd better start believing me.

732
01:05:47,840 --> 01:05:49,760
I just don't believe you would do that.

733
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:51,800
Try me.

734
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,600
Elaine! Elaine!
Benjamin?

735
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,920
Benjamin?
I'm coming up.
I'm not dressed yet.

736
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:16,480
Benjamin - I said I wasn't dressed.

737
01:06:16,600 --> 01:06:18,320
You've got to go over the back fence
and I'll meet you on the corner.

738
01:06:18,320 --> 01:06:19,480
Benjamin, what's the matter?

739
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:20,720
Hurry up. Put your shoes on.

740
01:06:23,120 --> 01:06:25,760
Benjamin, Benjamin.
Elaine.

741
01:06:25,760 --> 01:06:26,600
What are you doing?

742
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,080
Elaine, I have to tell you something.
What is it?

743
01:06:29,080 --> 01:06:29,840
That woman.
What?

744
01:06:29,840 --> 01:06:31,960
The older woman we talked about.

745
01:06:31,960 --> 01:06:33,880
You mean the one who -
Yes, the married woman.

746
01:06:34,000 --> 01:06:36,560
It wasn't just some woman -
What are you telling me?

747
01:06:36,680 --> 01:06:39,240
Benjamin, will you just tell
me what it is all about?

748
01:06:53,800 --> 01:06:54,760
Oh, no.

749
01:06:54,760 --> 01:06:57,160
Elaine -
Oh my God!

750
01:06:57,480 --> 01:06:59,680
Please!
Get out of here!

751
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:00,520
Don't cry -

752
01:07:01,600 --> 01:07:03,520
GET OUT!
GET OUT!

753
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,360
Goodbye, Benjamin.

754
01:09:04,640 --> 01:09:06,040
Say that again.

755
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,120
I'm going to marry Elaine Robinson.

756
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:16,640
Ha...Ha... Well - Well - Well

757
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:18,040
What's happening?

758
01:09:18,440 --> 01:09:22,000
Ben says he and Elaine
are getting married.

759
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,080
I don't believe it.

760
01:09:25,160 --> 01:09:28,040
That's what he says. Right?
I'm going up to Berkeley today.

761
01:09:33,000 --> 01:09:36,360
Come on, let's call the Robinsons.
We've got something to celebrate.

762
01:09:36,360 --> 01:09:38,120
No, I think you'll want
to wait on that.

763
01:09:38,120 --> 01:09:40,200
They don't know?
No - they don't.

764
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:43,360
Well, when did you decide all this?
About an hour ago.

765
01:09:43,480 --> 01:09:46,320
Wait a minute. You talked
to Elaine this morning?

766
01:09:46,320 --> 01:09:48,080
No, she doesn't know about it.

767
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:51,160
You mean she doesn't know
that you're coming up to Berkeley?

768
01:09:51,240 --> 01:09:54,320
No. Actually, she doesn't know
about us getting married yet.

769
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:57,440
When did you two talk this over?
We haven't.

770
01:09:57,760 --> 01:09:58,720
You haven't?

771
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:03,320
Ben, this whole idea
sounds pretty half-baked.

772
01:10:03,320 --> 01:10:06,880
No, it's not. It's completely baked.
It's a decision I've made.

773
01:10:07,360 --> 01:10:09,360
But what makes you think
she wants to marry you?

774
01:10:09,480 --> 01:10:12,400
She doesn't. To be perfectly
honest, she doesn't like me.

1045
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:19,300
You are student?
Not exactly.

1046
01:13:19,700 --> 01:13:21,140
What's not exactly?
- no.

1047
01:13:22,380 --> 01:13:23,620
What are you then?

1048
01:13:24,220 --> 01:13:26,140
Well, I'm just sort of traveling through.

1049
01:13:28,060 --> 01:13:32,580
I like to know who's living in my house,
like to know what my boys are up to.

1050
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,940
I'm not up too much.

1051
01:13:36,860 --> 01:13:38,340
I'm just visiting.

1052
01:13:40,420 --> 01:13:42,820
I mean - I've always wanted to see Berkeley.

1053
01:13:46,140 --> 01:13:48,300
You're not one of those agitators?
What?

1054
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:49,740
One of those outside agitators.
Oh - no.

1055
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:51,140
I hate that.
I won't stand for it.

1056
01:15:26,020 --> 01:15:28,900
Well, how about this for a coincidence.

1057
01:15:34,180 --> 01:15:36,100
I was wondering where
you were headed.

1058
01:15:36,860 --> 01:15:38,300
I'm meeting someone.

1059
01:15:38,300 --> 01:15:40,220
Ah. Where?

1060
01:15:43,260 --> 01:15:44,820
Where are you meeting this person?

1061
01:15:44,820 --> 01:15:45,780
At the zoo.

1062
01:15:46,620 --> 01:15:49,980
The Zoo. They have a pretty
good one here, do they?

1063
01:15:51,460 --> 01:15:53,260
I don't know, I've never seen it.

1064
01:15:53,460 --> 01:15:55,340
Oh. Well, I haven't either.

1065
01:15:57,660 --> 01:15:59,500
I might just ride out there with you.

1066
01:16:03,780 --> 01:16:06,180
Is that him over there?
No.

1067
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,300
Where did he say he was going to meet you?
I thought he said by the monkey house.

1068
01:16:14,940 --> 01:16:17,020
Benjamin - I would like to know
what you're doing here.

1069
01:16:17,220 --> 01:16:18,940
Here?  In Berkelely?
Yes.

1070
01:16:19,460 --> 01:16:23,300
Well, I have this very pleasant room on Carter
Street, and I've been getting to some classes.

1071
01:16:23,300 --> 01:16:24,220
But you're not enrolled.

1072
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:26,340
No, I just sit in.
They don't seem to mind.

1073
01:16:26,340 --> 01:16:28,140
They've been very congenial about it.

1074
01:16:28,260 --> 01:16:31,380
Benjamin - you're -
I don't know what to say.

1075
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,900
Maybe we could get together
some time and talk about it.

1076
01:16:34,180 --> 01:16:35,620
Really incredible.

1077
01:16:37,940 --> 01:16:39,540
Here he comes.
What?

1078
01:16:39,780 --> 01:16:41,860
I've got a real feeling
that this is the fellow.

1079
01:16:43,900 --> 01:16:44,860
Elaine!

1080
01:16:45,140 --> 01:16:46,580
He certainly is a good walker.

1081
01:16:47,540 --> 01:16:49,060
Am I late? I'm sorry.

1082
01:16:49,060 --> 01:16:50,660
We thought you said by
the monkey house.

1083
01:16:51,380 --> 01:16:53,860
This is Benjamin Braddock.
Carl Smith.

1084
01:16:54,260 --> 01:16:55,980
Benjamin rode here with me on the bus.

1085
01:16:56,260 --> 01:16:58,340
Glad to meet you, Ben.
Great meeting you, Carl.

1086
01:16:58,860 --> 01:16:59,980
Swell seeing you.

1087
01:17:42,180 --> 01:17:43,060
Who is this?

1088
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:46,780
I want to ask you a question. and I'm going.
Come in.

1089
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:49,500
No. I want to know why
you're here in Berkeley?

1090
01:17:49,740 --> 01:17:52,660
Because - I am.
Is it because I'm here?

1091
01:17:53,060 --> 01:17:54,980
What do you think?
I think it is.

1092
01:17:56,380 --> 01:17:58,420
I said I think it is.
All right then! Yes!

1093
01:17:58,500 --> 01:17:59,940
Well, I want you to leave.

1094
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,260
Oh, look, I love you!

1095
01:18:01,380 --> 01:18:04,060
How could you do that, Benjamin?
Do you just hate everything?

1096
01:18:04,460 --> 01:18:06,380
How could you possibly rape my mother?
What?

1097
01:18:06,380 --> 01:18:07,140
I don't understand -

1098
01:18:07,140 --> 01:18:10,100
I don't understand how you - how
anyone - could do a thing like that.
What did she say?

1099
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:11,220
You got tell me what did she say.

1100
01:18:11,220 --> 01:18:12,780
Why?
Because it isn't true.

1101
01:18:13,780 --> 01:18:14,700
Tell me.

1102
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,220
She said she was having a drink
in the hotel with a friend.

1103
01:18:17,220 --> 01:18:21,500
You waited for her in the parking lot and told
her she was too drunk to drive home

1104
01:18:21,500 --> 01:18:23,900
and you would get her a room for the night.

1105
01:18:23,900 --> 01:18:24,900
Then what?

1106
01:18:25,260 --> 01:18:27,180
Then you took her upstairs
and you raped her.

1107
01:18:27,180 --> 01:18:29,100
Oh, no, no, no, that's not what happened.

1108
01:18:29,380 --> 01:18:31,940
What happened was there
was this party at my parents.

1109
01:18:31,940 --> 01:18:34,500
I drove your mother home -
I don't want to hear it.

1110
01:18:34,540 --> 01:18:35,780
then we went upstairs
to see your portrait.

1111
01:18:35,780 --> 01:18:36,780
No - I no -
and when we got up in the room -

1112
01:18:36,780 --> 01:18:38,980
She is my mother!
- she starts taking her her clothes off

1113
01:18:38,980 --> 01:18:42,300
suddenly there she was without any
clothes on. I mean really naked.

1114
01:18:57,780 --> 01:18:59,940
Oh, hello, Mr. McCleery.
Who screamed?

1115
01:18:59,940 --> 01:19:01,340
It's all right, Mr. McCleery.

1116
01:19:01,620 --> 01:19:04,020
Screaming isn't all right.
Not in my house, it isn't.

1117
01:19:04,180 --> 01:19:06,100
It was just a visitor.
But it's all right now.

1118
01:19:08,020 --> 01:19:09,380
What did you do to her?

1119
01:19:09,540 --> 01:19:12,940
Look, she's all right. She's upset and
she screamed. But she's okay now.

1120
01:19:12,940 --> 01:19:14,380
Shall I get the cops?
What?

1121
01:19:14,380 --> 01:19:15,980
I'll get the cops.
Hey, wait a minute.

1122
01:19:16,300 --> 01:19:20,140
Damned look, see, here
she's having some water.

1123
01:19:21,380 --> 01:19:23,260
Now there's no need
for the cops or anything.

1124
01:19:23,740 --> 01:19:26,140
All right, boys, I think you can
get back to your rooms now.

1125
01:19:28,660 --> 01:19:30,740
I don't think we'll have
any more of this agitation.

1126
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,820
Will we, Braddock?
No, sir.

1127
01:19:37,300 --> 01:19:38,700
I want you out of here.

1128
01:19:39,180 --> 01:19:41,700
What do you mean?
You heard me. Out of here.

1129
01:19:41,700 --> 01:19:43,540
What for?
Because I don't like you.

1130
01:20:15,260 --> 01:20:16,660
I'm sorry I screamed.

1131
01:20:21,380 --> 01:20:23,260
Benjamin, when you came up here,

1132
01:20:23,260 --> 01:20:25,420
what did you think was going
to happen between us?

1133
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:29,820
Elaine - right now I don't
feel like talking much.

1134
01:20:29,820 --> 01:20:31,380
I'm sorry about everything.

1135
01:20:31,380 --> 01:20:32,900
but I think I'll just do this now.

1136
01:20:44,300 --> 01:20:46,220
Can I just sit here while you're packing?

1137
01:20:47,220 --> 01:20:48,140
If you want.

1138
01:21:01,020 --> 01:21:02,460
What are you going to do now?

1139
01:21:03,980 --> 01:21:04,940
I don't know.

1140
01:21:06,380 --> 01:21:08,020
Are you going home?
No.

1141
01:21:08,860 --> 01:21:09,940
Well, where are you going?

1142
01:21:14,220 --> 01:21:16,140
Elaine, you're going to stop asking me.

1143
01:21:29,020 --> 01:21:30,460
I don't want you to leave tomorrow.

1144
01:21:33,500 --> 01:21:34,780
I don't understand.

1145
01:21:35,300 --> 01:21:36,780
I don't want you to go anywhere.

1146
01:21:39,940 --> 01:21:41,700
until you have a definite plan.

1147
01:21:42,900 --> 01:21:43,860
Goodbye.

1148
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:19,940
What's happening?

1149
01:22:20,060 --> 01:22:21,740
Benjamin?
What?

1150
01:22:27,500 --> 01:22:28,740
Will you kiss me!

1151
01:22:55,500 --> 01:22:57,020
Will you marry me?

1152
01:23:00,500 --> 01:23:03,020
You won't?
I don't know.

1153
01:23:06,140 --> 01:23:09,620
But you might.
I might.

1154
01:23:10,380 --> 01:23:14,660
Is that so? You might marry me?
Yes.

1155
01:23:15,460 --> 01:23:16,500
When?

1156
01:23:18,140 --> 01:23:19,220
I don't know.

1157
01:23:20,180 --> 01:23:22,580
How about tomorrow?
I don't mean to be pushy but -

1158
01:23:22,580 --> 01:23:27,180
I don't know. I don't
know what's happening.

1159
01:23:28,860 --> 01:23:30,500
You mean you're confused?

1160
01:23:33,220 --> 01:23:35,220
Well, look, don't be confused.

1161
01:23:36,020 --> 01:23:37,220
We're getting married.

1162
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,220
I don't see how we can.

1163
01:23:43,940 --> 01:23:44,900
We just can.

1164
01:23:52,260 --> 01:23:53,740
I have to go now.

1165
01:23:55,740 --> 01:24:00,060
Elaine, are you serious about this?

1166
01:24:00,940 --> 01:24:02,340
I'll think about it.

1167
01:24:02,940 --> 01:24:05,140
You really will?
Yes.

1168
01:24:20,980 --> 01:24:23,660
We can go down and get our blood tests tomorrow.
Tomorrow?

1169
01:24:23,660 --> 01:24:25,380
Or this afternoon.
It's a good day for it.

1170
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,780
Benjamin, I haven't even
said I'll marry you yet.

1171
01:24:27,860 --> 01:24:29,500
We'll need our Birth Certificates.

1172
01:24:29,500 --> 01:24:31,620
I happen to have mine
with me. Where's yours?

1173
01:24:32,380 --> 01:24:34,780
I just don't think it would work.
Why wouldn't it?

1174
01:24:46,220 --> 01:24:48,780
Why wouldn't it?
I just don't think it would...

1175
01:24:50,420 --> 01:24:53,180
Tomorrow then - can we get our
blood tests tomorrow morning?

1176
01:24:54,540 --> 01:24:57,580
Why don't you just drag me off
if you want to marry me so much?

1177
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,260
Why don't I just drag you off?

1178
01:24:59,700 --> 01:25:02,700
All right, I will.
Right after we get the blood tests.

1179
01:25:03,180 --> 01:25:04,900
I have to see Carl first.

1180
01:25:05,100 --> 01:25:06,020
Carl who?

1181
01:25:09,860 --> 01:25:11,020
Carl who?

1182
01:25:11,900 --> 01:25:14,980
Carl Smith. He's a medical student.
We've known him for years.

1183
01:25:14,980 --> 01:25:16,900
Who, that guy at the Zoo?
Yes.

1184
01:25:16,900 --> 01:25:18,140
Why do you have to see him?

1185
01:25:18,300 --> 01:25:19,860
Well, I said I might marry him.

1186
01:25:21,580 --> 01:25:22,740
You WHAT?

1187
01:25:23,580 --> 01:25:24,940
How did he do it?

1188
01:25:25,220 --> 01:25:26,860
Did he get down on his knees?

1189
01:25:26,860 --> 01:25:28,780
He didn't get down on his knees, I hope.

1190
01:25:28,940 --> 01:25:30,020
No, Benjamin.

1191
01:25:30,100 --> 01:25:32,300
Well, what did he say?  I'm curious.

1192
01:25:33,940 --> 01:25:37,100
He said he thought we'd
make a pretty good team.

1193
01:25:37,220 --> 01:25:38,900
Oh no. He said that.

1194
01:25:39,780 --> 01:25:41,140
Where did he do it?

1195
01:25:42,980 --> 01:25:44,900
I'd like to know where it happened?

1196
01:25:48,220 --> 01:25:50,020
It wasn't in his car, was it?

1197
01:26:02,860 --> 01:26:03,860
Good Night.

1198
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:08,460
Are we getting married tomorrow?
No.

1199
01:26:09,620 --> 01:26:11,260
The day after tomorrow?

1200
01:26:13,060 --> 01:26:16,060
I don't know. Maybe we are
and maybe we aren't.

1201
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:07,780
Do you want, do you want to
try and tell me why you did it?

1202
01:27:09,660 --> 01:27:10,700
Mr. Robinson?

1203
01:27:10,900 --> 01:27:12,900
Do you have a special grudge against me?

1204
01:27:12,900 --> 01:27:15,700
Do you feel a particularly strong resentment?
No.

1205
01:27:15,700 --> 01:27:18,980
Is there something I've said
that's caused this contempt?

1206
01:27:18,980 --> 01:27:21,460
Or just the things I stand for that you despise?

1207
01:27:21,460 --> 01:27:22,860
It was nothing to do with you, sir.

1208
01:27:23,180 --> 01:27:25,860
Well, Ben, it was quite
a bit to do with me.

1209
01:27:25,860 --> 01:27:27,420
Now look, please!

1210
01:27:27,420 --> 01:27:30,940
Ben, I think we're two civilized people.
Do you think it's necessary to threaten each other?

1211
01:27:30,940 --> 01:27:32,380
I'm not threatening you.

1212
01:27:32,380 --> 01:27:35,260
Do you want to unclench your fists, please.
Thank you.

1213
01:27:35,380 --> 01:27:37,700
I can see in the dark, you know.
I've been here quite a while.

1214
01:27:37,820 --> 01:27:41,500
I am trying to tell you I have no personal
feelings about you, Mr. Robinson.

1215
01:27:41,500 --> 01:27:43,420
I am trying to tell you
I do not resent you.

1216
01:27:43,420 --> 01:27:45,620
You don't respect me terribly
much either, do you?

1217
01:27:46,580 --> 01:27:47,540
No, Sir.

1218
01:27:47,540 --> 01:27:49,180
What?
No, Sir.

1219
01:27:49,180 --> 01:27:53,580
Don't shout at me, Ben. I may not be younger
than you, but I still have good hearing.

1220
01:27:53,580 --> 01:27:54,580
Mr. Robinson.

1221
01:27:54,620 --> 01:27:56,620
Have you the patience to wait untill I finish?

1222
01:27:57,900 --> 01:28:00,380
I do think you know the consequences
of what you've done.

1223
01:28:00,460 --> 01:28:03,780
I do think you should know that my
wife and I are getting a divorce soon.

1224
01:28:04,140 --> 01:28:06,900
But why?
Why?

1225
01:28:07,100 --> 01:28:08,060
Listen to me.

1226
01:28:09,420 --> 01:28:13,620
What happened between Mrs. Robinson
and me was nothing. It mean anything.

1227
01:28:13,740 --> 01:28:17,180
We might just as well have been shaking hands.

1228
01:28:17,660 --> 01:28:21,500
Shaking hands. Well, that's not
saying much for my wife, is it?

1229
01:28:21,500 --> 01:28:23,420
You miss the point.
I guess I do.

1230
01:28:23,420 --> 01:28:26,180
The point is I don't love your wife.
I love your daughter, sir.

1231
01:28:27,260 --> 01:28:28,700
All right, now listen this.

1232
01:28:29,540 --> 01:28:32,220
I don't know what I can possibly do.
But I think I can.

1233
01:28:32,300 --> 01:28:35,700
I think I can get you behind bars if
you ever look at my daughter again.

1234
01:28:36,260 --> 01:28:38,940
I have seen Elaine and I make
damned sure you can get to...

1235
01:28:38,940 --> 01:28:40,420
Stay away from me, Ben!

1236
01:28:42,020 --> 01:28:43,660
I don't want to mince words with you.

1237
01:28:44,060 --> 01:28:47,660
As far as Elaine's concerned, you're to
get her out of your filthy mind right now.

1238
01:28:48,020 --> 01:28:51,420
Is that perfectly clear to you?
And that's all, Ben.

1239
01:28:51,500 --> 01:28:54,500
You'll pardon me if I don't
shake hands with you.

1240
01:28:56,460 --> 01:28:58,020
I think you are filth.

1241
01:28:58,620 --> 01:29:00,300
I think you are scum.

1242
01:29:02,340 --> 01:29:03,780
You are a degenerate!

1243
01:29:13,580 --> 01:29:15,980
Mr. McCleery, do you have some change?
I need to use the phone.

1244
01:29:16,540 --> 01:29:18,260
I want you out of here.

1245
01:29:18,340 --> 01:29:21,780
Look, I'll give you ten dollars
for a dime. I'll give you twenty.

1246
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:24,500
For God's sake, will you
let me use that phone?

1247
01:29:25,380 --> 01:29:27,540
I'll call the police, now.

1248
01:29:27,660 --> 01:29:29,460
Could I make one phone call first?

1249
01:29:29,860 --> 01:29:31,300
Get out here!

1250
01:29:42,060 --> 01:29:47,620
Elaine Robinson has left the school. Her
roommate is coming down with a note for you.

1251
01:29:51,060 --> 01:29:53,100
Dear Benjamin, please forgive me.

1252
01:29:53,380 --> 01:29:56,260
Because I know what I'm doing
is the best thing for you.

1253
01:29:56,620 --> 01:29:59,020
My father is so upset
you've got to understand.

1254
01:29:59,300 --> 01:30:01,220
I love you, but it would never work out.

1255
01:31:22,620 --> 01:31:23,620
Elaine.

1256
01:31:25,700 --> 01:31:27,100
Hello, Benjamin.

1257
01:31:31,780 --> 01:31:32,740
Where is she?

1258
01:31:32,740 --> 01:31:34,260
Hello. Get me the police, please.

1259
01:31:34,260 --> 01:31:35,140
Where is Elaine?

1260
01:31:35,220 --> 01:31:36,300
I'll be with you in a moment.

1261
01:31:36,460 --> 01:31:39,900
Do you have a petrol car in the
vicinity of 1200 Glenview Road.

1262
01:31:40,660 --> 01:31:42,180
Good, we have a burgler here.

1263
01:31:42,700 --> 01:31:45,100
Just a second. I'll ask him.
Are you armed?

1264
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,620
No, I don't believe he is.
Thank you!

1265
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:51,700
What have you done to her?

1266
01:31:51,780 --> 01:31:54,420
I think we have everything quite
under control now, Benjamin.

1267
01:31:54,460 --> 01:31:56,220
Would you like a quick drink before you go?

1268
01:31:56,220 --> 01:31:58,820
You can't stop me from seeing her,
Mrs. Robinson.  I'll find her.

1269
01:31:59,380 --> 01:32:01,900
I'm sorry we won't be able to invite
you to the wedding, Benjamin

1270
01:32:01,900 --> 01:32:03,740
but the arrangements have been so rushed.

1271
01:32:05,340 --> 01:32:06,740
What the hell have you done?

1272
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:14,660
Ahh.  I don't think you'll have
time for that drink after all.

1273
01:32:16,340 --> 01:32:18,500
I'll find her.
I don't think so.

1274
01:33:20,540 --> 01:33:25,140
Say, fellows. Any of you fellows
know where Carl Smith is?

1275
01:33:25,300 --> 01:33:27,940
He took off in the middle of
the night to get married.

1276
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:30,100
Proabaly one step ahead of the shotgun.

1277
01:33:31,060 --> 01:33:34,340
Would you happen to know where he's
getting married? I'm supposed to be there.

1278
01:33:34,820 --> 01:33:35,980
Why not just ask Carter?

1279
01:33:36,740 --> 01:33:38,740
Would you happen to know
where I might find him?

1280
01:33:39,300 --> 01:33:43,540
Hey, Carter, where's the Make
Out King getting married?

1281
01:33:43,660 --> 01:33:44,940
Santa Barbara.

1282
01:33:45,580 --> 01:33:49,180
You don't happen to know exactly where
the Make Out King is getting married, do you?

1283
01:33:49,180 --> 01:33:50,460
I'm supposed to be there.

1284
01:33:50,700 --> 01:33:52,260
Where side of Santa Barbara?

1285
01:33:53,620 --> 01:33:55,940
I don't know. Maybe at his old man's house.

1286
01:33:56,300 --> 01:33:57,940
He only told me these words.

1287
01:33:58,980 --> 01:34:00,900
Are you going to the wedding?
Yes.

1288
01:34:01,180 --> 01:34:03,300
Hey, tell him to save the piece for me.

1289
01:34:05,140 --> 01:34:06,180
of the wedding cake.

1290
01:34:50,540 --> 01:34:52,460
Can I use your phone?
Yes.

1291
01:35:18,100 --> 01:35:20,420
657-2036
Hello - who is this?

1292
01:35:20,460 --> 01:35:22,300
This is Dr. Smith's answering service.

1293
01:35:22,300 --> 01:35:23,460
Is the doctor anywhere?

1294
01:35:23,660 --> 01:35:26,300
I'm afraid Doctor can't be reached right now.
If you like to...

1295
01:35:26,300 --> 01:35:27,500
I'd like to know where he is.

1296
01:35:28,060 --> 01:35:31,380
Well, you see, the doctor is at his son's
wedding, but I'm sure it's over by now.

1297
01:35:31,380 --> 01:35:32,860
He should be checking in any moment.

1298
01:35:32,860 --> 01:35:36,700
Listen to me. I am Dr. Smith's
brother - Reverend Smith -

1299
01:35:36,700 --> 01:35:39,660
and I am supposed to perform the
ceremony. I just got in from Portland.

1300
01:35:39,660 --> 01:35:41,300
and I've forgotten what church, you see?

1301
01:35:41,580 --> 01:35:45,540
Oh. Well, I'm not sure, but you
might try the First Presbyterian.

1302
01:35:45,540 --> 01:35:47,260
That's on Allan Street.
Thank you!

1303
01:35:48,500 --> 01:35:49,740
Allan Street. Where is it?

1304
01:35:50,900 --> 01:35:58,060
Alan Street. It's, it's
6 blocks up, and 3 over.

1305
01:35:59,340 --> 01:36:01,060
You need any gas, Father?

1306
01:37:44,620 --> 01:37:47,260
Oh, Jesus - God - no -

1307
01:37:57,740 --> 01:38:07,860
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1308
01:38:08,100 --> 01:38:10,140
Who is that guy?
What's he doing?

1309
01:38:10,660 --> 01:38:12,820
I'll take care of him.
He is too late.

1310
01:38:14,500 --> 01:38:21,660
Elaine! Elaine! Elaine! Elaine!

1311
01:38:22,620 --> 01:38:24,540
Get to stop him.

1312
01:38:42,380 --> 01:38:44,100
Ben!

1313
01:38:49,100 --> 01:38:51,460
You are crazy buck!

1314
01:39:07,100 --> 01:39:09,620
Elaine, it's too late.
Not for me!Not for me!
