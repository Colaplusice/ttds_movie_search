1
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:32,440
Come on, Louis. Come on.

2
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:11,230
They should make heroin
look like something else.

3
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:13,740
Candy bars, maybe.

4
00:01:13,900 --> 00:01:17,740
You're gonna have to hurry, Louis.
I'm gonna miss my plane.

5
00:01:43,430 --> 00:01:46,020
Be careful, Lisa.

6
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:47,980
You too, Louis.

7
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,160
Taxi!

8
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,660
Taxi!

9
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:59,930
Air Canada...

10
00:03:00,090 --> 00:03:06,310
...flight 760 dC-9 jetliner service...

11
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:10,440
...for New York's Kennedy
International Airport.

12
00:05:53,720 --> 00:05:56,140
Hey, is this St. Luke's Place?

13
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,150
-You, number 98.
-Who, me?

14
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,740
-Where's St. Luke's Place?
-I don't know nothing. I'm a dropout.

15
00:06:04,900 --> 00:06:07,280
I asked you a question, kid.

16
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,740
-Yeah, this is it.
-Thanks.

17
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:17,710
Big man on campus.

18
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:20,420
What did she say?

19
00:06:20,580 --> 00:06:22,960
I told you, she just left a message.

20
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,880
-But she asked for me?
-That's right.

21
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:30,510
-Happy days are here again, huh?
-Well, we'll see.

22
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,330
-You sure this is right?
-Read it yourself.

23
00:06:53,490 --> 00:06:57,000
Don't make waves.
I only asked a question.

24
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:21,140
Lisa?

25
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:23,900
-Lisa?
-What are you calling for?

26
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:26,530
She says she's not here.

27
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:12,130
-Lisa doesn't live here.
-Yeah, I know. It's clean.

28
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,930
What's the matter?

29
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:25,190
Since when can Lisa type?

30
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:30,360
Since never. Come on.

31
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:32,730
You think the place is bugged?

32
00:09:55,880 --> 00:10:00,180
-You want something?
-You, Mr. Talman.

33
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:07,390
And you too, Sgt. Carlino.
I want you too.

34
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,400
In fact, I want both of you,
and I've come here to buy you.

35
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,900
Sgt. Carlino, if you'd
just shut that door, please.

36
00:10:17,070 --> 00:10:19,160
Don't call me "sergeant."

37
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:21,370
Why? Are you a touchy man?

38
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:26,710
-Just don't call me "sergeant."
-No matter. Sit. Sit.

39
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:29,120
We'll have a little chat.

40
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:40,340
-We'll start with, who are you?
-I'm Harry Roat Jr. From Scarsdale.

41
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,720
Scarsdale?

42
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,770
Well, now, may we have
weapons on the table?

43
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,770
We'll have explanations first.

44
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,270
Well, this goes back a little.

45
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,400
-So go back a little.
-Alrighty.

46
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:00,070
Once upon a time...

47
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:02,780
...there was a fairy princess
named Lisa.

48
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:09,500
And she had two very good friends,
who shall remain nameless.

49
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:14,250
Now, these three were fond of performing
little dramas for select audiences.

50
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:18,550
Their most memorable performances
were that of outraged husband...

51
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:22,640
...and detective breaking in upon
guilty wife in the arms of her lover...

52
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:24,010
...or vice versa.

53
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,520
They were adaptable.

54
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:36,610
The detective, it's worth mentioning, was
particularly convincing in his performance...

55
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:41,610
...but then he had had the benefit
of previous on-the-job training.

56
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,120
-Man, you're a charmer.
-Thank you.

57
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,460
Things went trippingly
for our three heroes...

58
00:11:50,620 --> 00:11:56,500
...until one day, a certain stockbroker,
a Charles F. Parker, wasn't it? Got nasty.

59
00:11:56,670 --> 00:12:01,300
And then our poor heroes went to jail,
or two of them did.

60
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:05,300
Lisa, well...

61
00:12:06,050 --> 00:12:07,890
Well, she...

62
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,770
She escaped.

63
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,310
What's the point?

64
00:12:11,520 --> 00:12:14,150
Lisa would like to do something
for her two friends...

65
00:12:14,350 --> 00:12:16,690
...now that they're back
in circulation again.

66
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:19,070
-What does she want?
-A doll...

67
00:12:19,230 --> 00:12:22,320
...for which she will pay handsomely.

68
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:25,990
Now may we have weapons on the table?

69
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,660
-I'm clean.
-Scout's honor?

70
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:34,750
Lisa says you favor brass, sergeant.
That pocket looks a little lumpy.

71
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:42,220
I cannot negotiate in an atmosphere
of mistrust.

72
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,350
Why, you?

73
00:13:13,210 --> 00:13:16,710
-And, you, what's your favorite toy?
-Geraldine.

74
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:21,670
What does she do?

75
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:27,850
-May we have Geraldine on the table too?
-No, we may not.

76
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,850
-Why the hell not?
-Because she's the referee.

77
00:13:34,270 --> 00:13:38,020
Now, Lisa will pay you $2000 each
for a couple hours work.

78
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,730
Interested?

79
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,860
What kind of work?

80
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,530
Finding Lisa's doll.

81
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,160
-Are you serious?
-I am.

82
00:13:50,620 --> 00:13:54,620
-What kind of doll?
-An ordinary doll, a child's doll.

83
00:13:57,460 --> 00:13:59,250
What's in it?

84
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,510
-Do we hurt anybody?
-Not a fly.

85
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,930
-Do you care?
-No.

86
00:14:10,970 --> 00:14:14,560
-What do you think?
-What's to think? He's a creep.

87
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:18,310
Yeah, baby. Not like us, huh?

88
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:21,610
We want an advance.

89
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:25,280
250. Each.

90
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:28,910
Lisa and I thought more like 500 each.

91
00:14:29,070 --> 00:14:30,200
Why so generous?

92
00:14:31,950 --> 00:14:34,450
So you don't ask what's in the doll.

93
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,290
So now we know what's in the doll.

94
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:41,540
Well, win one, lose one.

95
00:14:41,710 --> 00:14:43,460
It's all straight.

96
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:46,380
What do we do?

97
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:51,350
What you always do, Mr. Talman,
lie and cheat and play-act.

98
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:57,600
-Go on.
-Lisa gave the doll to a man named Hendrix.

99
00:14:57,770 --> 00:15:00,310
She met him on the plane from Montreal.

100
00:15:00,520 --> 00:15:02,150
Lisa's friendly.

101
00:15:02,310 --> 00:15:03,320
Why?

102
00:15:03,520 --> 00:15:05,980
Somebody waiting for her,
she hadn't expected...

103
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,650
...so Hendrix brought it home here.

104
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:10,320
Hendrix? Who's he?

105
00:15:10,530 --> 00:15:13,530
He's... nobody.

106
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:17,660
Mr. Clean. A photographer.

107
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:21,920
Looks like he has a wife. Where's she?

108
00:15:23,250 --> 00:15:24,710
Out.

109
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,050
She goes to school.

110
00:15:27,210 --> 00:15:29,840
Come on. This is a hell of a place
to be talking.

111
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,300
Don't panic, sergeant.

112
00:15:32,470 --> 00:15:36,520
-Why not?
-Because it's arranged. It's all arranged.

113
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,350
By you?

114
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:43,360
Photographer Hendrix is in his studio
waiting to photograph a certain Miss Lejiana.

115
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:46,280
But a little while ago,
her male secretary phoned...

116
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:49,440
...very efficient, very humble,
grovelingly polite...

117
00:15:49,610 --> 00:15:51,610
...to say that she had been delayed.

118
00:15:52,410 --> 00:15:56,240
-He's terrific.
-Last night, Lisa called up about the doll...

119
00:15:56,410 --> 00:15:58,620
...but Mr. Hendrix couldn't find it.

120
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:01,540
He looked all over for it,
but he couldn't find it.

121
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:04,170
Doesn't that strike you odd?

122
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:08,210
It strikes me odd too, Mr. Talman.

123
00:16:08,590 --> 00:16:12,890
-Was he lying?
-I don't know, but we're gonna find out.

124
00:16:13,430 --> 00:16:16,260
Now, look around.
Familiarize yourself with the place.

125
00:16:16,430 --> 00:16:18,720
We're coming back here tomorrow.

126
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,560
And the doll is here, you're sure?

127
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,690
Lisa and I checked earlier.
We didn't see it. It's here, though.

128
00:16:29,780 --> 00:16:31,860
Did you look in here?

129
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:38,910
Well, anyway, we don't work safes.

130
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:42,920
I know, but you talk, and that's why
you've been invited to this party...

131
00:16:43,080 --> 00:16:46,250
...to talk your way into that big,
black safe, sergeant.

132
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:52,930
-There's a locked closet in the bedroom.
-Not there. Just clothes.

133
00:16:53,090 --> 00:16:55,090
-How do you know?
-I looked.

134
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:58,220
-You got the key?
-It's on the ledge above the door.

135
00:16:58,390 --> 00:17:00,140
No, it isn't.

136
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,310
They must have taken it with them.

137
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:07,360
Lock the closet when they
don't bolt the front door?

138
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,280
They're strange people.
They lose dolls.

139
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:16,410
I think you just made a mistake.

140
00:17:18,990 --> 00:17:20,950
I'd like the key.

141
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:22,960
Well, if you...

142
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:27,630
All right, fat man, over there.
Both of you through the door, backwards.

143
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,990
If you'd only said please.

144
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:15,340
And now I'd like the key.

145
00:18:17,130 --> 00:18:18,890
Please?

146
00:19:16,030 --> 00:19:17,570
Go look.

147
00:19:26,580 --> 00:19:29,580
Well, she was trespassing, Mike...

148
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:30,750
...poaching...

149
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:33,040
...going into business for herself.

150
00:19:33,210 --> 00:19:34,960
Bad news.

151
00:19:35,130 --> 00:19:37,420
Things like that go on,
what do you have?

152
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,840
Anarchy.

153
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,850
No discipline, no sense of order.
Bad news.

154
00:19:45,970 --> 00:19:47,180
Out!

155
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:54,980
-Haven't you forgotten something?
-We just earned the money.

156
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:57,070
I mean fingerprints.

157
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:03,200
You just signed your names
all over this place.

158
00:20:09,870 --> 00:20:13,710
Even if you could remember, it'd
still take you hours to wipe them up.

159
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,040
If not days.

160
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:18,300
As for me...

161
00:20:18,710 --> 00:20:22,680
...well, I've only touched one thing
since I've been in here.

162
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:27,140
And now it's clean...

163
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:33,400
...like me. No police record,
no known associations with Lisa.

164
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:35,520
Nothing, in fact.

165
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,610
I could let you go and what would happen?
I'd evaporate.

166
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:40,940
But you? Bad news.

167
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,910
Don't forget this, sarge.

168
00:20:43,070 --> 00:20:45,370
And the icebox, don't forget the icebox.

169
00:20:45,530 --> 00:20:47,330
Carlino, knock it off!

170
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:52,410
We can prove where we were
when this happened.

171
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:55,750
Oh, and when did it happen?

172
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:58,500
-Just before you let me in?
-So?

173
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:03,220
So if you do exactly what I tell you...

174
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:07,350
...there will be no police,
there will be no problems.

175
00:21:07,550 --> 00:21:08,600
Go on.

176
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:11,730
First, get her out of here.
Roll her up in this.

177
00:21:11,890 --> 00:21:14,230
I got a van by the corner.
I'll bring it out front.

178
00:21:14,390 --> 00:21:16,560
Why not the back, where
there's less publicity?

179
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,070
There's no back door.

180
00:21:18,230 --> 00:21:21,610
We'll dump her where I found this.
Give me a hand.

181
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,900
-She'll be found.
-I hope so.

182
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:26,620
All she's got on her is a hotel key.
When they check...

183
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:29,540
...they'll see she's Mrs. Harry Roat Jr.

184
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:32,160
-From Scarsdale.
-Right.

185
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:35,670
This changes things a little, you know?

186
00:21:35,830 --> 00:21:38,090
That's what I figured.
We'll talk about it later.

187
00:21:38,250 --> 00:21:40,210
No, we'll talk about it now.

188
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,220
It was 2000 each. Now it's 4.

189
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:57,400
Get behind the door, and, you, back there.

190
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:02,030
Stay dead still.
She's alone. Don't breathe.

191
00:22:13,910 --> 00:22:15,580
Sam?

192
00:22:17,580 --> 00:22:19,500
Sam, are you here?

193
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:26,930
No, Susy, I'm not here.

194
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,340
Gloria?

195
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:36,660
-Hendrix here.
-Hendrix here too.

196
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:41,540
I called to tell you I was the best
in blind school today.

197
00:23:41,710 --> 00:23:45,090
-That's my girl.
-I really truly was, cross my heart.

198
00:23:45,250 --> 00:23:46,300
And I believe you.

199
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:48,920
So can I tap my way over to your studio?

200
00:23:49,090 --> 00:23:50,590
Not now.

201
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:55,140
Some female with the unlikely name
of Lejiana is due any minute for a sitting.

202
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,390
Well, I'll wait for you here, then.

203
00:23:58,560 --> 00:24:02,350
Look, I'll tell you what. Since
this Lejiana character is already late...

204
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:04,520
...I'll just stick around
a few more minutes.

205
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:08,780
So can I come over and wait for you
in the coffee shop downstairs?

206
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,450
Sure.

207
00:24:10,610 --> 00:24:15,080
Won't be hard to find me.
I'll be the one reading Peter Rabbit in Braille.

208
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,660
-Bye.
-Bye.

209
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:29,130
Damn it. You're supposed to be there.

210
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,390
Gloria, I know you're there.

211
00:25:45,670 --> 00:25:49,000
Mr. Hendrix won't wait forever.
Shall we go to work, children?

212
00:25:49,170 --> 00:25:52,010
Two plus two, 4000.

213
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:54,630
Two plus two, Mr. Talman.

214
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,980
Highly recommended.
Disposable, you buy them in enormous rolls...

215
00:26:07,150 --> 00:26:09,150
...from Hammacher Schlemmer.

216
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,440
Spread out the rug.

217
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:20,990
Trouble.

218
00:26:22,490 --> 00:26:24,200
Trouble.

219
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,130
-Hi, Susy. Hey.
-Hi, Shatner.

220
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,300
Let me help you with that mess.

221
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:42,560
Oh, you're a lovely cavalier,
only don't tell Sam you helped me.

222
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,810
I'm supposed to be learning
total self-sufficiency.

223
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:48,350
Why don't you come down
for a drink tonight?

224
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:53,320
I can't. I'm off to Vermont for
a couple of days of chasing stretch pants.

225
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:59,490
By the way, I haven't been able
to get in touch with our slumlord all day.

226
00:26:59,910 --> 00:27:01,910
And my skylight's still broken.

227
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,790
-If you see him...
-We never see him.

228
00:27:04,950 --> 00:27:08,540
He's owed us a new refrigerator since we
moved in, so he doesn't come around.

229
00:27:11,210 --> 00:27:13,840
Don't let it get you down.
Have a good weekend.

230
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,260
On Monday, we'll form a tenants committee
or something jazzy like that.

231
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:21,550
Some committee. Me, you, Sam,
Gloria and her mother.

232
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,220
Oh, well.

233
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,640
-Ciao.
-Ciao.

234
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:52,040
-Susy?
-No, Batman.

235
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,300
-Safe to open the door?
-All right.

236
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:03,600
-You want to give me a hand, darling?
-Sure.

237
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,720
Who are you doing?

238
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:10,230
Gloria.

239
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:14,020
She's been after me for weeks
to take some pictures.

240
00:28:15,520 --> 00:28:18,440
I promised I'd have these done.
I've got to go to Asbury Park...

241
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:22,030
-Asbury Park? I thought you...
-Sorry, I only found out this second.

242
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:25,740
That's all right. I was just
planning something silly.

243
00:28:25,950 --> 00:28:28,500
-Will it hold till tomorrow?
-Sure.

244
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,080
Someone called from the chemical company.
They saw my Sunday Times spread.

245
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:35,130
They want me to make their new factory
look like the U.N.

246
00:28:35,290 --> 00:28:37,420
Another night shot.

247
00:28:37,630 --> 00:28:39,970
They're paying handsomely.
That's the last one.

248
00:28:40,130 --> 00:28:42,380
-Can I go with you?
-Sure, but I'll...

249
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:45,930
Be home much quicker if you don't.

250
00:28:46,350 --> 00:28:48,970
You know there was a murder
around here last night?

251
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:50,730
They found the body this morning.

252
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:53,520
A lady from Scarsdale.
I heard it on the radio.

253
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:54,770
So?

254
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,230
What if I get chopped up in little pieces
and dumped in the river?

255
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,860
Little tiny pieces that nobody
could ever recognize...

256
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,450
...as having been a poor,
defenseless, blind lady...

257
00:29:03,610 --> 00:29:05,950
...whose husband was off in Asbury Park.

258
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:08,580
-You're not listening, Sammy.
-Sure I am.

259
00:29:08,740 --> 00:29:11,120
Why don't we have some light
around here?

260
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,330
They're always finding bodies in New York.

261
00:29:13,500 --> 00:29:17,090
Not in the parking lot
practically next door, they don't.

262
00:29:17,960 --> 00:29:22,130
-You're making it up, Susy.
-No, I'm not. I promise.

263
00:29:22,300 --> 00:29:25,300
I told you I heard it on the radio.
Really, I did.

264
00:29:25,470 --> 00:29:27,350
Come on, Susy.

265
00:29:31,730 --> 00:29:35,560
The police don't have
the first notion who did it.

266
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:39,530
Pretty spooky, don't you think, Sammy?

267
00:29:39,690 --> 00:29:41,190
Tell you what I think.

268
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:44,400
I think it's a ploy to make me stay home.

269
00:29:44,780 --> 00:29:47,740
Well, there was a murdered woman
found from Scarsdale...

270
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:50,490
...and that's a true fact.

271
00:29:50,660 --> 00:29:53,710
And you're afraid for your life,
that's a true fact?

272
00:29:53,870 --> 00:29:57,580
No, but it was worth a try.

273
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:16,140
Fourteen.

274
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,520
-You sure he'll go?
-Yeah.

275
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,530
-He'd better hurry or he'll miss the bus.
-He's got time.

276
00:30:25,610 --> 00:30:29,410
This is some day for a schlep
out to Asbury Park.

277
00:30:38,290 --> 00:30:41,170
-When does your bus leave?
-Five.

278
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,380
Time for another cup of coffee?

279
00:30:44,760 --> 00:30:46,340
Maybe half a cup.

280
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:50,300
If that doll woman calls,
tell her I haven't found it yet.

281
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:53,890
Let Gloria look around for it while she's
down here. It must be somewhere.

282
00:30:54,060 --> 00:30:57,020
I don't want Gloria today.

283
00:30:57,190 --> 00:30:59,230
I don't need her.

284
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:03,070
-Yes, you do, for your shopping.
-No Gloria!

285
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:08,570
-Give me a hint?
-You can find it by yourself.

286
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,530
If you couldn't, I'd tell you.

287
00:31:11,030 --> 00:31:13,450
-What have you got against Gloria?
-A lot.

288
00:31:13,620 --> 00:31:16,750
The problem is, she's in love with you,
which makes me the villain.

289
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,590
Susy, she's a kid.
More to your left, in front of you.

290
00:31:22,250 --> 00:31:23,750
I'd rather have a dog.

291
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:25,550
Dogs can't shop at the supermarket.

292
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:28,550
They can't rearrange the furniture either
so I trip over it.

293
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,140
That's her latest hobby.
I nearly broke my leg last night.

294
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,060
She's been sneaking cigarettes too.
I smelled smoke when I came in yesterday.

295
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:38,100
Susy, give her a chance.

296
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:42,980
Her father's run off again. Her mother's
flitted out for a weekend uptown.

297
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:46,070
Poor old Gloria gets slammed around
like a Ping-Pong ball.

298
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:48,070
On top of that, she's wearing glasses.

299
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:49,990
Kids are giving her the treatment...

300
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:53,030
...calling her the "monster from outer space."

301
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,080
Icebox needs defrosting, darling,
only my way this time.

302
00:31:56,250 --> 00:31:59,580
It's more practical.
Use plenty of boiling water.

303
00:31:59,750 --> 00:32:02,250
-What if I burn both my hands off your way?
-Don't.

304
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:04,340
The Unguentine's in the emergency drawer.

305
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:07,130
If the weather's okay, try walking
to the studio and back.

306
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,380
No cheating.

307
00:32:08,550 --> 00:32:11,010
Do I have to be the world's
champion blind lady?

308
00:32:11,470 --> 00:32:12,470
Yes!

309
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,860
Then, I will be.

310
00:32:28,190 --> 00:32:31,030
I'll be whatever
you want me to be.

311
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:35,080
Tell me what you want,
and that's what I'll be.

312
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:38,120
-Susy...
-I mean it.

313
00:32:38,290 --> 00:32:40,910
I don't want you ever
to be anything but Susy...

314
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:42,830
...because that's the way I love you.

315
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,040
Do you? Do you?

316
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,550
What do you think?

317
00:32:57,350 --> 00:33:00,430
-Do you want me to stay home?
-Yes.

318
00:33:01,850 --> 00:33:04,520
But you can go to work anyway.

319
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:05,690
I'll clean up here...

320
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:10,030
...then when you get back,
I'll be all scrubbed and polished.

321
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,280
You sure it's okay?

322
00:33:12,530 --> 00:33:14,570
Then, I got to rush.

323
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,330
Where does the icebox plug in?

324
00:33:18,490 --> 00:33:21,750
You'll find it.
No fair asking Gloria either.

325
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:23,460
Sam.

326
00:33:23,790 --> 00:33:26,250
Are you looking at me?

327
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:30,710
-Bye, dope.
-Bye, dope.

328
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,480
Thanks for everything.

329
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:08,750
Okay, Mr. Talman,
it's time for your soft-shoe.

330
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:14,300
And remember, there's a nice, little, pink kid
running around the house.

331
00:34:14,470 --> 00:34:17,140
And she wears glasses.

332
00:34:49,130 --> 00:34:50,130
Sam.

333
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,590
Gloria!

334
00:34:51,750 --> 00:34:54,050
Somebody!

335
00:35:01,010 --> 00:35:02,140
Operator.

336
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,810
-Please...
-Fire department.

337
00:35:03,970 --> 00:35:06,730
There's something burning.
I'm blind, and I can't locate it.

338
00:35:06,890 --> 00:35:09,190
-It's getting worse!
-Can I have your address?

339
00:35:09,350 --> 00:35:11,150
27B...

340
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:13,440
Wait, I think somebody's here.
Come in!

341
00:35:14,230 --> 00:35:16,700
The door's open.

342
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,490
-You all right?
-There's a fire. Can you see it?

343
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:22,740
-I'm blind, and I don't know where it is.
-Oh, yes, I've got it.

344
00:35:23,330 --> 00:35:25,450
-Careful.
-I'm all right. Please find the fire.

345
00:35:25,620 --> 00:35:28,000
It's in the ashtray.

346
00:35:29,710 --> 00:35:32,130
It's only a cigarette butt.

347
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:35,260
A filter and a bit of paper
making all the smoke.

348
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,050
Where was it?

349
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,390
It was on the...

350
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,140
What is this, a safe?

351
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:48,350
Against the wall? Yes.

352
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:50,730
I couldn't tell where it was coming from.

353
00:35:50,900 --> 00:35:52,270
Smoke...

354
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:55,900
Smoke isn't my favorite thing.

355
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:59,360
-I don't know you, do I?
-No, Mrs. Hendrix.

356
00:35:59,530 --> 00:36:03,120
My name's Mike Talman.
I used to know Sam.

357
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:08,910
I can't thank you enough
for being here.

358
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:12,380
And I'm sorry that Sam isn't here.

359
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:14,550
He won't be back until later tonight.

360
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:16,710
That was stupid of me.
I should've phoned...

361
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:20,180
...but I thought I'd take a chance
and maybe grab Sam for a quick beer.

362
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,390
Wait. Let me give you a hand with that.

363
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,640
-You got it.
-Thank you.

364
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:32,690
I haven't seen Sam for years,
but some people you don't forget.

365
00:36:32,860 --> 00:36:34,980
Oh, Sam you don't forget.

366
00:36:35,150 --> 00:36:36,570
I don't anyway.

367
00:36:36,980 --> 00:36:38,440
He saved my life.

368
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,570
How do you mean that?

369
00:36:40,740 --> 00:36:44,280
-I mean, he saved my life.
-That makes two of us.

370
00:36:44,450 --> 00:36:46,330
That makes two of us, Mrs. Hendrix.

371
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:48,410
Susy.

372
00:36:48,580 --> 00:36:49,910
Susy.

373
00:36:50,080 --> 00:36:51,370
Thank you.

374
00:36:51,540 --> 00:36:54,080
You mean in the Army or something?

375
00:36:54,630 --> 00:36:57,670
In the Marines, yes.
The 3rd Battalion.

376
00:36:59,300 --> 00:37:00,630
-Charlie Company.
-Right.

377
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,930
-Has he ever told you about that?
-No. Tell me.

378
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,760
No, you ask Sam.

379
00:37:05,970 --> 00:37:07,760
Oh, please. He won't tell me.

380
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:10,850
You'd better ask Sam.
He likes to do things his own way.

381
00:37:11,020 --> 00:37:13,520
-You're just as mean as he is.
-That's us.

382
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:17,070
-Mean Mike and Mean Sam.
-Well, you are.

383
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,150
Would you like a drink, Mike Talman?

384
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:21,740
No. No, thank you.

385
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,070
Are these Sam's, these pictures?

386
00:37:25,240 --> 00:37:28,410
-Yes.
-Yeah, I thought so.

387
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:31,120
Hey, here's one of me.

388
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,840
I sure have put on a few pounds
since those days.

389
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,380
Tell me something,
did you know Sam then?

390
00:37:40,630 --> 00:37:44,470
No, we only met a year ago,
not long after my accident.

391
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,010
You...?

392
00:37:47,180 --> 00:37:49,390
You lost your sight in an accident?

393
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:53,560
Yes, in a car crash
or really the fire from the crash.

394
00:37:54,390 --> 00:37:56,980
One day, I was practicing
crossing at the lights...

395
00:37:57,190 --> 00:38:01,070
...and the cars were piling up
around me like mad, and...

396
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,030
...suddenly, a man named Sam
grabbed me.

397
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:06,200
And that was that.

398
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:10,120
Gloria?

399
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:13,080
-Who's that?
-A little girl.

400
00:38:13,250 --> 00:38:15,870
Come in, Gloria.

401
00:38:22,260 --> 00:38:24,510
She went out.

402
00:38:26,090 --> 00:38:30,060
Well, I'm sorry to have missed Sam,
but I'm happy to have met you.

403
00:38:30,220 --> 00:38:33,390
You're very lovely.
Sam's lucky.

404
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,690
So's Susy.

405
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:37,940
Goodbye.

406
00:38:38,110 --> 00:38:41,780
Please tell Sam that I stopped by.

407
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:45,200
Next time I come in from Phoenix,
I'll drop a line first.

408
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,740
Thank you forever and ever for...

409
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,030
Oh, Lord! Hello? Are you still there?

410
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:51,700
I have to have your address.

411
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:55,120
Listen, I can't tell you how sorry I am
to have kept you.

412
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:57,790
You're wonderfully good
to have stuck around.

413
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,670
-did you find the fire?
-Yes, it's out.

414
00:39:00,840 --> 00:39:03,130
-It was just a cigarette.
-Okay, then, ma'am?

415
00:39:03,300 --> 00:39:04,840
Yes, thank you.
Everything is now.

416
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:07,680
Goodbye.

417
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,600
How awful.

418
00:39:11,970 --> 00:39:13,220
Mike?

419
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:14,770
Who's Mike?

420
00:39:14,930 --> 00:39:16,850
Hello, Gloria.

421
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:21,900
-Who was that man?
-Friend of Sam's from the Marines.

422
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,440
You wouldn't know him, dear.

423
00:39:24,610 --> 00:39:26,200
Oh, I see.

424
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:29,360
Is the grocery list ready?
The supermarket closes soon.

425
00:39:29,530 --> 00:39:33,290
It's on the typewriter with the $5.
Can you see it?

426
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:37,620
Oh, and, Gloria?

427
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,540
When you come back,
give me a hand with the icebox.

428
00:39:40,710 --> 00:39:43,630
I've got to defrost it while Sam's away.

429
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:54,310
-What did you do then?
-Switched it to defrost, of course.

430
00:39:54,470 --> 00:39:56,560
-That's not how it's done.
-It is too.

431
00:39:56,730 --> 00:39:58,810
I've done it for Mother
hundreds of times.

432
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:01,610
Your mother's refrigerator is modern.
This one's ancient.

433
00:40:01,770 --> 00:40:03,400
We've got to do it Sam's way. We...

434
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:07,280
Okay, do it Sam's way, then.
I'll go to the A&P.

435
00:40:07,490 --> 00:40:09,740
Did you close the door?

436
00:40:11,530 --> 00:40:12,530
Yes.

437
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:16,290
-I didn't hear it shut.
-Okay, so it's open.

438
00:40:17,580 --> 00:40:20,420
-Please shut the door.
-Close it yourself. You're nearer.

439
00:40:22,580 --> 00:40:24,380
Gloria, close the door.

440
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:30,680
-No!
-Gloria!

441
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,890
No, I won't!

442
00:40:32,050 --> 00:40:35,060
Listen, little monster,
I won't put up with this one more minute!

443
00:40:37,600 --> 00:40:39,270
What's that?

444
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:42,650
What are you doing?
Stop it!

445
00:40:42,860 --> 00:40:46,070
Stop it! Gloria, do you hear me?
Stop it!

446
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,400
Stop it!

447
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,530
You shouldn't have called me names.

448
00:41:37,450 --> 00:41:39,410
I don't call you names.

449
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:44,790
I shouldn't say things like that.
It was wrong of me.

450
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:48,300
-It's okay.
-No, it isn't okay.

451
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:50,460
People shouldn't say that
to each other.

452
00:41:50,630 --> 00:41:54,010
They're mean things,
and people shouldn't say mean things.

453
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:57,390
Guess I get terribly frightened sometimes.

454
00:41:57,600 --> 00:42:01,980
I'm not a very good blind lady, Gloria,
and I'm still not used to all this...

455
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,600
...dark brown.

456
00:42:03,770 --> 00:42:07,610
I get cranky and impatient and...

457
00:42:07,770 --> 00:42:11,940
-I know I look dreadful half the time.
-Oh, no. You're gorgeous.

458
00:42:15,820 --> 00:42:18,780
What a lovely thing to say.

459
00:42:18,950 --> 00:42:21,200
Thank you, Gloria.

460
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:27,960
But I do wish I could do things.
You know, important things like...

461
00:42:28,130 --> 00:42:31,130
...cook a souffl or pick a necktie...

462
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:34,420
...or choose the wallpaper for the bedroom,
you know?

463
00:42:34,630 --> 00:42:36,640
Sure. I know.

464
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:41,350
I want to be gorgeous.
Guess you can't have everything, huh?

465
00:42:42,020 --> 00:42:44,060
I guess not.

466
00:42:48,230 --> 00:42:51,730
I'm sorry, Susy, for being horrid.

467
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:54,820
And me for being an old crank.

468
00:42:55,860 --> 00:43:00,200
-We break anything?
-Oh, no. I only threw unbreakables.

469
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:03,870
-That was crafty of you.
-I learned it from Daddy.

470
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:10,500
Okay, pumpkin, let's clean all this up,
and you can hop off to the supermarket.

471
00:43:11,840 --> 00:43:14,260
Look out!
There's a knife there.

472
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:19,640
Thanks.

473
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:23,140
Run along. I'll put this away
so I know where to find it.

474
00:43:23,310 --> 00:43:26,190
-Right. See you later.
-Okay.

475
00:43:29,730 --> 00:43:30,730
Bye.

476
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,160
I should very much like to speak
with Mr. Sam Hunt, little girl.

477
00:43:38,320 --> 00:43:40,870
Who's he?
Well, he doesn't live here.

478
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:44,160
-Leave, little girl.
-Susy!

479
00:43:44,370 --> 00:43:48,210
-Susy!
-Leave, little girl. Go about your business.

480
00:43:49,630 --> 00:43:53,710
-Gloria, what is it?
-I should like to see Mr. Sam Hunt...

481
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:57,420
...and tell Mrs. Roat that I should
also like to see her. Where are they?

482
00:43:57,590 --> 00:44:00,930
-Who are you?
-It's not right, you know, and it's not fair!

483
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:03,180
-Well, tell me what you...
-In there!

484
00:44:03,350 --> 00:44:05,770
What is it you want?
What are you doing?

485
00:44:06,430 --> 00:44:07,980
You can't go in there.

486
00:44:10,900 --> 00:44:11,980
Tell me who you are.

487
00:44:14,730 --> 00:44:19,820
Here! I was right, you silly thing,
and now I've got the proof.

488
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:23,240
You tell Sam Hunt to leave her alone
or I'll fix him!

489
00:44:23,410 --> 00:44:26,540
-Please...
-Good and proper!

490
00:44:33,130 --> 00:44:34,920
Oh, yes, yes.

491
00:44:35,340 --> 00:44:37,920
Don't touch me.

492
00:44:47,270 --> 00:44:50,310
Susy, it's Mike Talman again.
I think I left a package.

493
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:51,900
Mike!

494
00:44:52,060 --> 00:44:53,730
-Susy, what's wrong?
-Mike.

495
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:56,230
There was a man here.
He flew in like a black crow.

496
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:58,070
He's gone now. It's all right.

497
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:00,610
-I'm scared.
-I'm here now. It's all right.

498
00:45:00,780 --> 00:45:02,110
You must be so bored with me.

499
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:04,620
Every time you come,
I'm in absolute panic.

500
00:45:04,780 --> 00:45:07,120
No, no, no.

501
00:45:07,290 --> 00:45:10,830
Bedroom's a mess.
He's dumped stuff all over the place.

502
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:14,210
I better call the police.
He might have stolen something.

503
00:45:15,960 --> 00:45:17,960
Do you know the number?

504
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:20,800
279...

505
00:45:20,970 --> 00:45:23,050
...0099.

506
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:25,760
That's the emergency number anyway.

507
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:28,520
That's good enough.

508
00:45:29,640 --> 00:45:33,400
279...

509
00:45:34,730 --> 00:45:35,860
...0...

510
00:45:36,020 --> 00:45:38,440
-0.
-...0...

511
00:45:38,610 --> 00:45:40,190
...9...

512
00:45:42,360 --> 00:45:43,360
...9.

513
00:45:47,490 --> 00:45:50,200
Don't worry.
I'll take a later flight to Phoenix...

514
00:45:50,370 --> 00:45:52,620
-...and stay as long as you need me.
-Could you?

515
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:54,630
Of course.

516
00:45:55,460 --> 00:45:57,460
Hello?

517
00:45:58,050 --> 00:45:59,050
Police?

518
00:46:00,010 --> 00:46:02,340
And the guy just busted in?
That right?

519
00:46:02,510 --> 00:46:05,010
Yes, he was at the door
when the little girl went out.

520
00:46:05,180 --> 00:46:07,140
Gloria from upstairs.

521
00:46:07,300 --> 00:46:09,100
Yeah, I got that down.

522
00:46:09,260 --> 00:46:12,810
-Then he pulled out the drawers.
-Sergeant, obviously the man's crazy.

523
00:46:12,980 --> 00:46:15,480
Why don't you send a report
and have him picked up?

524
00:46:15,650 --> 00:46:19,110
Just tell me the facts.
I'll decide what to do, if you don't mind.

525
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:20,820
Well, I do mind.

526
00:46:21,030 --> 00:46:25,160
-You act as if nothing happened.
-We'd better let the sergeant do it his way.

527
00:46:25,360 --> 00:46:27,950
Thank you, lady.

528
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:45,800
The important thing is, this guy
didn't steal anything, right?

529
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:47,010
No.

530
00:46:48,010 --> 00:46:50,810
No, not as far as we know.

531
00:46:51,140 --> 00:46:53,520
I think I'll help myself
to that drink now.

532
00:46:53,680 --> 00:46:55,020
Sure.

533
00:46:56,140 --> 00:46:58,360
Well, I won't bother you anymore.

534
00:46:58,560 --> 00:47:02,190
If there's anything missing,
call the 6th Precinct and let me know.

535
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:04,900
-Thank you, sergeant.
-Anytime.

536
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:07,910
Bye.

537
00:47:08,910 --> 00:47:11,740
-Can I fix you something?
-No, thanks.

538
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,290
Hello.

539
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,750
Oh, just a minute.
It's for the sergeant.

540
00:47:20,920 --> 00:47:22,300
I'll get him.

541
00:47:22,460 --> 00:47:24,590
Sergeant!

542
00:47:25,050 --> 00:47:26,590
Sergeant!

543
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,300
-What is it?
-You're wanted on the phone.

544
00:47:32,260 --> 00:47:34,430
Sorry to trouble you, Mrs. Hendrix.

545
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,640
Afraid this is going
to be one of those days.

546
00:47:37,810 --> 00:47:39,770
Thank you.

547
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:41,900
Carlino here.

548
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:44,690
Yes, lieutenant, go ahead.

549
00:47:45,110 --> 00:47:47,610
He just walked in?

550
00:47:47,780 --> 00:47:50,990
Well, what's a doll got to do with it?

551
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,330
Sure.

552
00:47:52,620 --> 00:47:54,410
Sure, I understand.

553
00:47:54,620 --> 00:47:56,460
Right.

554
00:47:58,620 --> 00:48:01,750
Mrs. Hendrix, I might as well
mention this while I'm here.

555
00:48:01,960 --> 00:48:03,300
I don't want to alarm you...

556
00:48:03,460 --> 00:48:05,960
...but there was a woman found
near here this morning.

557
00:48:06,130 --> 00:48:07,930
-I know.
-You knew her?

558
00:48:08,130 --> 00:48:09,300
That's not what I said.

559
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,140
I know what happened.
I heard it on the radio.

560
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,970
Oh, I see.

561
00:48:15,310 --> 00:48:17,890
Did your husband happen
to know her, by any chance?

562
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,770
-My husband?
-Of course he didn't.

563
00:48:19,980 --> 00:48:23,570
I'm sorry, Mr. Talman,
I was asked to make inquiries.

564
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,990
Did you hear anything peculiar yesterday
afternoon or evening, Mrs. Hendrix?

565
00:48:29,150 --> 00:48:31,530
No, I didn't.
We were out all afternoon.

566
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,240
I go to blind school,
and my husband was at the studio.

567
00:48:34,410 --> 00:48:36,540
Was there anybody with him
at his studio?

568
00:48:36,700 --> 00:48:39,160
-No.
-Hey, wait a minute. What is this?

569
00:48:39,330 --> 00:48:42,710
He was supposed to photograph a girl,
and she didn't turn up.

570
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,380
Nobody can verify he was there
or what he was up to?

571
00:48:45,550 --> 00:48:47,630
Are you questioning her
for a reason?

572
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,340
-I'm not questioning her.
-Why are you taking notes?

573
00:48:50,680 --> 00:48:52,140
I'm allowed to talk, you know.

574
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:54,970
Sure, but she's allowed not to.
She doesn't have to answer.

575
00:48:55,180 --> 00:48:57,520
Don't they study the Constitution
at police school?

576
00:48:57,680 --> 00:48:59,690
-You some lawyer?
-No, but I know her rights!

577
00:48:59,850 --> 00:49:01,850
I didn't think you were.

578
00:49:02,020 --> 00:49:03,770
Well...

579
00:49:03,940 --> 00:49:06,150
Goodbye, Mrs. Hendrix.

580
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,150
I'll probably be back.

581
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:19,250
-Mike?
-Well, he was certainly a big help.

582
00:49:19,410 --> 00:49:22,080
Is...? Is this room dirty?

583
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,880
No. Why?

584
00:49:24,040 --> 00:49:27,340
The sergeant kept dusting things.

585
00:49:28,550 --> 00:49:31,340
-Did he?
-Yes.

586
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:34,430
Over by the refrigerator and...

587
00:49:34,600 --> 00:49:36,260
...the banisters.

588
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:39,770
Here.

589
00:49:39,930 --> 00:49:41,520
I'll get it.

590
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:44,350
Sergeant probably forgot his badge.

591
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:55,950
Forgive me for bursting in on you
like this, Mr. Hunt.

592
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:58,790
No. Mr. and Mrs. Hendrix live here.

593
00:49:58,950 --> 00:50:02,000
Hendrix. Oh, I'm terribly sorry...

594
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:04,250
...but is this 27B Saint Luke's Place?

595
00:50:04,420 --> 00:50:06,460
I'm Mrs. Hendrix. Can I help you?

596
00:50:06,630 --> 00:50:10,960
My name is Roat. Harry Roat Jr.

597
00:50:16,970 --> 00:50:19,430
What is it, Susy?

598
00:50:22,430 --> 00:50:25,650
-Mr. Roat, Mrs. Hendrix is blind.
-Oh, I see.

599
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:28,650
I'm sorry for intruding upon you
and Mr. Hendrix...

600
00:50:28,820 --> 00:50:32,440
-No, my name's Talman.
-Yes, well, whatever.

601
00:50:32,610 --> 00:50:34,780
Mrs. Hendrix, has my father been here?

602
00:50:34,950 --> 00:50:37,950
-The old man?
-Yes, do let me explain.

603
00:50:38,120 --> 00:50:42,370
I'm so embarrassed.
It all must be just a terrible mistake.

604
00:50:42,540 --> 00:50:46,080
He made a mess of Mrs. Hendrix's things.
You better straighten him out.

605
00:50:46,290 --> 00:50:48,920
Well, he's not crazy, I assure you.
He's not crazy.

606
00:50:49,130 --> 00:50:53,970
He's just very old, and he thinks
a photographer named Sam Hunt lives here.

607
00:50:54,130 --> 00:50:58,260
He's very old, my father,
and very worried for my sake.

608
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:03,140
He thinks that my wife has been...

609
00:51:03,730 --> 00:51:05,940
...seeing this Mr. Hunt.

610
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:08,610
And that's why I've troubled you with my...

611
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:11,980
Hi, Susy, I've got the groceries.

612
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,780
Thanks, Gloria.

613
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:16,150
I'll put them away.

614
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:17,950
Okay.

615
00:51:18,870 --> 00:51:21,330
-See you.
-Bye.

616
00:51:21,910 --> 00:51:24,830
You know, you really do have
the wrong house, Mr. Roat.

617
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,330
-Here.
-We don't know anyone named Hunt.

618
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,750
I don't know this man Hunt either,
dear lady. May I explain?

619
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,130
Three years ago...

620
00:51:32,340 --> 00:51:35,470
...my wife was on vacation in Montreal
with my mother and father.

621
00:51:35,630 --> 00:51:39,470
And while she was there,
my wife became acquainted...

622
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:43,470
...my father says, with this photographer
named Sam Hunt.

623
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:46,810
Now, my father says
that they've been seeing each other...

624
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,900
...from time to time ever since.

625
00:51:49,060 --> 00:51:51,020
My wife is...

626
00:51:51,190 --> 00:51:52,320
...very beautiful.

627
00:51:52,480 --> 00:51:55,110
-What is all this about, Mr. Roat?
-Well...

628
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:58,990
...I believe my father followed my wife
to this apartment.

629
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:00,530
You're wrong.

630
00:52:01,780 --> 00:52:04,540
You see, the other afternoon,
there was a big scene.

631
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:07,330
There were testy words
between my wife and my father...

632
00:52:07,500 --> 00:52:10,170
...and my wife stormed out of the apartment
with her doll.

633
00:52:10,330 --> 00:52:11,340
Her doll?

634
00:52:11,540 --> 00:52:14,340
Yes, the doll was what started
the bad words that day.

635
00:52:14,510 --> 00:52:18,510
It was especially made for my wife
in Montreal to play her favorite tune.

636
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:31,900
The point is that when my wife left
the house, my father said to me:

637
00:52:32,060 --> 00:52:34,730
"Sam Hunt gave her that doll.
Do you know that?"

638
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:37,900
And then he ran out
of the house to look for her.

639
00:52:38,070 --> 00:52:42,030
Later, my father called and said
he lives at 27B Saint Luke's Place...

640
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,620
...in the basement apartment.

641
00:52:44,910 --> 00:52:50,080
And then this morning, when I told Dad
that Lejiana hadn't...

642
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:52,670
Lejiana?

643
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:54,710
Yes. Lejiana, my wife.

644
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:57,550
When I told Dad that she hadn't
come home last night...

645
00:52:58,090 --> 00:53:01,050
...he got terribly excited
and drove off in my car...

646
00:53:01,220 --> 00:53:04,930
...so I finally decided to come here
on the off-chance that...

647
00:53:05,310 --> 00:53:09,730
-Your wife didn't come home last night?
-That's right and...

648
00:53:14,150 --> 00:53:15,610
Want me to get it, Susy?

649
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:23,570
Hello.

650
00:53:23,910 --> 00:53:25,490
Yeah. Hang on.

651
00:53:25,660 --> 00:53:28,620
Susy, it's that Sgt. Carlino.
He wants to speak to you.

652
00:53:28,790 --> 00:53:30,460
Why?

653
00:53:30,620 --> 00:53:32,710
-May I take a message?
-I'm leaving now.

654
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,000
-No, I'll take it.
-Forgive me for intruding.

655
00:53:35,170 --> 00:53:36,500
Well, his son's here now.

656
00:53:36,670 --> 00:53:38,510
Don't go. He wants to talk to you.

657
00:53:38,670 --> 00:53:41,180
-Who? Who does?
-The police.

658
00:53:41,470 --> 00:53:45,300
-Say I've gone.
-It's about your wife, Mr. Roat.

659
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:49,470
Hello.

660
00:53:49,640 --> 00:53:50,770
Speaking.

661
00:53:51,020 --> 00:53:53,480
That's right. No, she didn't.

662
00:53:54,060 --> 00:53:55,400
In fact...

663
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,610
Was she hurt?

664
00:53:57,860 --> 00:54:00,190
No, tell me now.

665
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,790
-Mr. Roat!
-Mike!

666
00:54:14,170 --> 00:54:16,670
Oh, I'm frightened.

667
00:54:16,840 --> 00:54:19,210
I'm very frightened.

668
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:21,300
Don't worry, Susy.

669
00:54:21,470 --> 00:54:23,590
He's gone.

670
00:54:29,470 --> 00:54:30,850
Mrs. Roat is dead.

671
00:54:31,310 --> 00:54:33,690
She was murdered last night near here.

672
00:54:33,850 --> 00:54:36,650
-What did you say?
-And the police think Sam did it.

673
00:54:36,810 --> 00:54:40,230
-Sam?
-Yes. The doll.

674
00:54:40,650 --> 00:54:44,530
The doll.
The one Mr. Roat Jr. described.

675
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:47,910
Sam brought a doll exactly like that
back from Canada.

676
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:52,580
I was trying to help him unpack from the trip
when something fell on the floor.

677
00:54:52,750 --> 00:54:56,960
The something played a little tune.
The something was a doll!

678
00:54:57,130 --> 00:55:03,590
Mrs. Roat's special-made, handmade,
made-in-Canada doll. Sam had it!

679
00:55:04,010 --> 00:55:06,590
I thought it was a surprise
for me, but it wasn't.

680
00:55:06,760 --> 00:55:08,930
It was for a little girl in the hospital.

681
00:55:09,100 --> 00:55:11,850
A woman at the airport
asked Sam to carry it for her...

682
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:16,190
...so that her other girl, who was meeting
her, wouldn't see it and get jealous.

683
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:19,860
The woman called yesterday about getting
the doll, and Sam couldn't find it.

684
00:55:20,020 --> 00:55:24,320
Sam never met the doll lady
in his life before. He told me so.

685
00:55:24,490 --> 00:55:26,410
Don't do this to yourself, Susy.

686
00:55:26,570 --> 00:55:29,120
Then there was the woman
he was supposed to photograph.

687
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,950
Sam said she didn't show up.

688
00:55:31,120 --> 00:55:33,580
But he was away a long time
waiting for her.

689
00:55:33,750 --> 00:55:37,250
And her name was Lejiana,
and so is Mrs. Roat's.

690
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:40,340
Well, suppose he did know her.
It's not so serious.

691
00:55:40,500 --> 00:55:43,210
Oh, but it is.

692
00:55:43,380 --> 00:55:45,760
All right, then.
Let's say that it's serious.

693
00:55:48,430 --> 00:55:50,800
Let's try to figure this all out.

694
00:55:50,970 --> 00:55:53,310
From the beginning.

695
00:55:54,060 --> 00:55:56,850
First, the old man came in screaming
about Sam and Mrs. Roat.

696
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:59,020
He went into your bedroom
and tore it apart.

697
00:55:59,190 --> 00:56:01,440
He messed up your dresser.
Why did he do that?

698
00:56:03,320 --> 00:56:06,860
He must have taken something, Susy.
He just must have.

699
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:08,910
Come here.

700
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:14,120
Now, look.

701
00:56:14,450 --> 00:56:18,460
Check, feel around,
see if anything's missing.

702
00:56:30,760 --> 00:56:33,350
Our wedding picture's gone.
The one of Sam and me.

703
00:56:33,510 --> 00:56:35,600
Do you see it anywhere?

704
00:56:35,770 --> 00:56:37,350
No.

705
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:40,980
That's the meanest thing I ever heard of.
I'm calling the police.

706
00:56:41,650 --> 00:56:42,730
No!

707
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,480
No, Mike, we can't.

708
00:56:44,650 --> 00:56:47,110
We mustn't say anything
to the police. Nothing.

709
00:56:47,280 --> 00:56:50,950
They've got to forget all about us, Mike.
They think Sam did it!

710
00:56:52,570 --> 00:56:53,950
Please.

711
00:57:01,460 --> 00:57:03,630
What is it?

712
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:16,010
-That's funny.
-What's funny?

713
00:57:16,310 --> 00:57:19,600
There's a police car pulling up outside.

714
00:57:20,980 --> 00:57:23,770
They're just standing there.

715
00:57:34,870 --> 00:57:38,250
Susy, I think they're watching this house.

716
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:45,750
Don't worry.

717
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:57,050
It's no good, Mike.

718
00:57:57,220 --> 00:57:58,800
What?

719
00:57:58,970 --> 00:58:01,930
The doll. I can't find it.

720
00:58:02,100 --> 00:58:04,890
Hold on. I just found another suitcase.

721
00:58:05,060 --> 00:58:06,220
What?

722
00:58:06,390 --> 00:58:09,270
I just found another suitcase.

723
00:58:20,450 --> 00:58:22,240
Any luck?

724
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:25,030
Well, just some papers.

725
00:58:25,910 --> 00:58:27,500
And some letters.

726
00:58:27,660 --> 00:58:32,000
Well, if any of them are from Mrs. Roat,
don't bother to read them to me.

727
00:58:32,630 --> 00:58:34,380
Oh, they're from you, Susy.

728
00:58:35,170 --> 00:58:37,130
You type very well.

729
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:40,630
I didn't know Sam was a hoarder.

730
00:58:45,180 --> 00:58:49,140
Listen to me. We've got to face
the fact that Sam's in trouble.

731
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:51,480
We've got to find that doll.

732
00:58:51,640 --> 00:58:54,900
It's the one thing that proves
that Sam's connected with this.

733
00:58:55,060 --> 00:58:57,650
But it's not here.
We've looked for it.

734
00:58:57,820 --> 00:59:00,860
Well, now, wait a minute.
You're the one who told me.

735
00:59:01,030 --> 00:59:03,780
You said that Sam brought a doll
back from Canada.

736
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,370
You said it's the same doll
that Roat described.

737
00:59:06,530 --> 00:59:09,200
You went right down the line
and told me that it proved...

738
00:59:09,370 --> 00:59:11,620
...that Sam and Mrs. Roat were connected.

739
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:14,790
And now Mrs. Roat's dead,
murdered right next door.

740
00:59:15,000 --> 00:59:17,960
-Maybe I was wrong.
-That doesn't matter.

741
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:20,670
If you thought that way,
the police will think that way.

742
00:59:20,840 --> 00:59:24,390
Without the doll, it's a lot of ranting
and raving from those crazy Roats...

743
00:59:24,550 --> 00:59:26,970
...but with it,
the police have a case involving Sam.

744
00:59:27,140 --> 00:59:28,510
-Mike...
-Do you understand?

745
00:59:28,680 --> 00:59:32,890
Mike, did you notice how I jumped
when Mr. Roat Jr. came in here?

746
00:59:33,060 --> 00:59:36,900
-Have you been listening to me?
-For a moment, I thought it was the old man.

747
00:59:37,070 --> 00:59:41,030
He had on the exact same shoes
as his father. New shoes.

748
00:59:41,190 --> 00:59:43,320
And one of them squeaked a little bit.

749
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:46,700
-You probably didn't notice.
-No, I didn't.

750
00:59:46,870 --> 00:59:49,490
And another thing, it's winter.

751
00:59:49,700 --> 00:59:52,660
-It's dark early now, isn't it?
-Yes.

752
00:59:52,870 --> 00:59:57,170
Then why has everybody been
playing around with the blinds?

753
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,750
-What?
-Mr. Roat did it.

754
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:02,840
And Sgt. Carlino did it too.

755
01:00:03,010 --> 01:00:04,760
Mike.

756
01:00:04,930 --> 01:00:08,600
Is that police car still outside?

757
01:00:08,890 --> 01:00:11,140
I'll check and see.

758
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:28,570
-Yes, and they're looking this way.
-See their faces, the policemen in the car?

759
01:00:28,740 --> 01:00:31,790
-Not very well. It's pretty dark.
-Try. This is important.

760
01:00:31,950 --> 01:00:35,460
-Why?
-Is one of the policemen Mr. Roat?

761
01:00:35,620 --> 01:00:37,420
-Is it?
-No.

762
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:39,880
No, it isn't.

763
01:00:40,090 --> 01:00:42,590
There'd be a radio inside a police car,
wouldn't there?

764
01:00:42,760 --> 01:00:45,050
Yeah, I suppose.
What are you getting at?

765
01:00:45,260 --> 01:00:47,340
Sgt. Carlino fiddles with the blinds...

766
01:00:47,510 --> 01:00:50,310
...and immediately, the police phone
and ask to speak to him.

767
01:00:50,470 --> 01:00:55,810
Then Mr. Roat Jr. fiddles with the blinds,
and Carlino calls him.

768
01:00:55,980 --> 01:00:59,900
No, I don't think the police
work like that. It's too cops and robbers.

769
01:01:00,060 --> 01:01:02,940
Mr. Roat's story and Sam's
don't go together.

770
01:01:03,110 --> 01:01:06,780
And I've been forgetting something
very important.

771
01:01:06,950 --> 01:01:09,530
-What's that?
-That I know Sam...

772
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:11,080
...and I don't know Mr. Roat.

773
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:14,950
You've got to get this through your head.
It's what the police think that counts.

774
01:01:15,120 --> 01:01:17,420
If we wanna help Sam,
we've gotta find that doll...

775
01:01:17,580 --> 01:01:21,170
-But it isn't here! It isn't here!
-It must be!

776
01:01:22,250 --> 01:01:25,590
-It's got to be in this safe.
-But I told you, it couldn't be.

777
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:28,680
-And why not?
-Because it isn't ours. Not really.

778
01:01:28,840 --> 01:01:32,470
The woman who had this apartment
wanted to sell it to us when we moved in.

779
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:34,810
When we convinced her that we
didn't want it...

780
01:01:34,970 --> 01:01:38,850
...she locked it and deliberately dropped
the key down the drain outside.

781
01:01:39,020 --> 01:01:42,190
-Susy, you're making that up.
-I am not. Why should I?

782
01:01:42,650 --> 01:01:45,360
-Be careful.
-Why should I?

783
01:01:45,690 --> 01:01:49,660
On second thought, I don't suppose
I'd open my safe in front of a stranger.

784
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:54,830
Have I been treating you like a stranger?
I wish the doll were in the safe.

785
01:01:54,990 --> 01:01:56,910
It is your problem, isn't it?

786
01:01:57,080 --> 01:02:00,750
Yours and Sam's. You have to do
what you think is best for him.

787
01:02:00,920 --> 01:02:02,380
Where are you going?

788
01:02:02,540 --> 01:02:06,130
To pick up my things at the apartment.
I can't miss the last plane.

789
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:10,180
-You said you'd stay.
-Sam will be home soon.

790
01:02:10,340 --> 01:02:12,680
Will you give me a phone number?

791
01:02:14,140 --> 01:02:15,600
What phone number?

792
01:02:15,770 --> 01:02:18,270
Where you're going,
in case I find the doll.

793
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:19,980
I'll phone when I get there.

794
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:23,150
Give me the name of your friend
so I can call Information.

795
01:02:23,360 --> 01:02:28,150
Well, yeah, I may have it
written down someplace.

796
01:02:28,320 --> 01:02:32,120
-Here it is. Can you remember it?
-Yeah.

797
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:35,790
-Cl2...
-242. That's like ours. Go on.

798
01:02:35,950 --> 01:02:40,790
-4598.
-242-4598.

799
01:02:41,420 --> 01:02:42,960
Right.

800
01:02:43,130 --> 01:02:44,710
Mike?

801
01:02:46,340 --> 01:02:48,170
Thank you.

802
01:03:01,730 --> 01:03:05,320
Five, nine.

803
01:03:13,870 --> 01:03:16,910
-Where's Roat?
-Who knows?

804
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:21,540
Out beating up old ladies.
How goes it inside?

805
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,710
She's something, man.
She is really something.

806
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,380
Yeah.

807
01:03:29,420 --> 01:03:33,050
You're on next. Give her a minute,
then push her as hard as you can.

808
01:03:33,220 --> 01:03:36,100
Really push. Keep hinting at
that safe and the doll.

809
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:39,970
If it's in there and she can't open it,
she will after you've gone.

810
01:03:40,140 --> 01:03:43,690
What about Roat Jr. from Scarsdale?

811
01:03:43,850 --> 01:03:46,900
Yeah. What about him?

812
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,730
Who's that?

813
01:04:27,810 --> 01:04:30,230
It's only me, Susy.

814
01:04:32,650 --> 01:04:34,450
Thank goodness.

815
01:04:35,490 --> 01:04:39,200
When I got upstairs, I found I'd left
a stick of butter in the bag.

816
01:04:39,370 --> 01:04:45,330
Do you remember the man who was
here when you brought the groceries?

817
01:04:45,500 --> 01:04:48,460
-Which one?
-Not Sam's friend. The other one.

818
01:04:48,630 --> 01:04:50,550
-Sure.
-What did he look like?

819
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:53,130
Kind of dumb-looking, I guess.

820
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,300
-You'd recognize him, wouldn't you?
-Yeah.

821
01:04:56,510 --> 01:04:57,800
Come.

822
01:04:58,850 --> 01:05:02,180
Get up on a chair
and look out the window.

823
01:05:05,180 --> 01:05:11,270
There's a police car out there. Can you
see the face of the man inside of it?

824
01:05:12,070 --> 01:05:14,190
There's no police car.

825
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:18,490
-Are you sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

826
01:05:20,700 --> 01:05:22,700
There's no car out there.

827
01:05:22,870 --> 01:05:27,170
Well, yes, there is, a kind of squatty
truck. Right by the phone booth.

828
01:05:27,370 --> 01:05:30,630
Phone booth?
Is there anyone inside the truck?

829
01:05:30,790 --> 01:05:33,050
Well, there's a man standing near it.

830
01:05:33,210 --> 01:05:36,260
Is it the man who was here
when you brought the groceries?

831
01:05:36,420 --> 01:05:40,890
I don't think so.
Susy, he's coming this way.

832
01:05:49,980 --> 01:05:52,190
Watch out. He's looking
through the window.

833
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:55,780
-Can he see you?
-No, but he's still looking.

834
01:06:07,080 --> 01:06:10,500
I think he's going. He's go...

835
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:16,970
You had it!

836
01:06:17,420 --> 01:06:20,010
-I was only borrowing...
-We've got to hide it.

837
01:06:20,180 --> 01:06:23,470
-Where is it? Give it to me.
-Under your feet.

838
01:06:24,140 --> 01:06:27,020
I was only borrowing it.
That's why I brought it back.

839
01:06:27,180 --> 01:06:32,270
Where are we going to put it? In
the washing machine. Come. Help me.

840
01:06:54,750 --> 01:06:56,590
-Gloria?
-Yeah?

841
01:06:56,800 --> 01:07:01,090
How would you like to do something
difficult and terribly dangerous?

842
01:07:01,260 --> 01:07:04,180
-I'd love it.
-Can you see the phone from upstairs?

843
01:07:04,350 --> 01:07:06,640
-From mother's bedroom, I think.
-Good.

844
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:11,640
Go upstairs and watch that phone booth.
Don't take your eyes off it for a second.

845
01:07:11,810 --> 01:07:15,270
Now, if anyone from the truck
goes in and makes a call...

846
01:07:15,480 --> 01:07:18,780
-... phone me as soon as they come out.
-Got it.

847
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,860
Just let the phone ring twice and
then hang up. Remember, twice.

848
01:07:23,030 --> 01:07:26,330
-I know. Like a signal.
-Good girl.

849
01:07:26,870 --> 01:07:32,420
Susy, if you need me for anything, just
bang on the water pipes in the corner.

850
01:07:45,470 --> 01:07:49,100
-Who's that?
-Sgt. Carlino.

851
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,350
Quick, under the stairs.

852
01:07:52,270 --> 01:07:56,690
I'll be right with you, sergeant.
Just a minute.

853
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:02,820
Coming.

854
01:08:06,200 --> 01:08:08,620
I'm sorry to keep you waiting.

855
01:08:09,540 --> 01:08:11,960
I'm glad you dropped by, sergeant.

856
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:15,830
Some children were playing out back,
and I think they broke a window.

857
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,920
-Would you mind taking a look?
-In here?

858
01:08:19,090 --> 01:08:20,590
I think so.

859
01:08:46,030 --> 01:08:47,780
There's nothing broken here.

860
01:08:47,950 --> 01:08:51,540
Well, maybe in the bathroom.
It's hard for me to tell.

861
01:09:07,260 --> 01:09:09,640
There's nothing broken anywhere.

862
01:09:10,510 --> 01:09:16,560
Look, Mrs. Hendrix, I understand
Mr. Roat called on you this afternoon.

863
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,900
Yes, he was here for a moment.

864
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:25,900
You've been looking for something, I see.

865
01:09:26,070 --> 01:09:29,070
I couldn't find the garbage bags.

866
01:09:57,640 --> 01:09:59,100
No?

867
01:10:00,190 --> 01:10:03,520
Do you know what I think?
You can't find that doll.

868
01:10:03,690 --> 01:10:06,280
It's not that. I couldn't
find the garbage bags.

869
01:10:06,440 --> 01:10:09,860
No, the doll! The doll your husband
brought back from Canada.

870
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:13,580
-The doll he gave Mrs. Roat.
-My husband did not know Mrs. Roat.

871
01:10:13,740 --> 01:10:16,450
I'm sorry, Mrs. Hendrix,
that's just not true.

872
01:10:16,660 --> 01:10:20,040
Mr. Roat recognizes your husband
from a photograph his father has.

873
01:10:20,210 --> 01:10:24,670
And old man Roat remembers seeing
your husband and Mrs. Roat together.

874
01:10:24,840 --> 01:10:30,090
Now. Now, I wonder where
that doll can be.

875
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:34,810
-In that big, black safe maybe?
-No, there's nothing in the safe.

876
01:10:35,010 --> 01:10:37,770
There is no doll, and my husband
never knew Mrs. Roat.

877
01:10:37,930 --> 01:10:41,850
He did, as a matter of fact, know her.
Now, if you don't open that safe...

878
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:44,150
...I'll get a search warrant and drill it.

879
01:10:44,360 --> 01:10:48,190
It'll take me less than 10 minutes
and before your husband gets back.

880
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,410
-Who are you phoning?
-The 6th Precinct.

881
01:10:50,570 --> 01:10:52,070
I want to speak to Mr. Roat.

882
01:10:52,240 --> 01:10:54,080
-Operator?
-Wait a minute.

883
01:10:54,240 --> 01:10:57,580
Mrs. Hendrix, I'll get him.
I can get through quicker.

884
01:11:11,590 --> 01:11:15,220
-Hello?
-Sixth Precinct, Carlino speaking.

885
01:11:15,390 --> 01:11:16,680
Go ahead.

886
01:11:16,890 --> 01:11:20,770
Is Mr. Roat Jr. still there?
Mrs. Hendrix wants to speak to him.

887
01:11:20,940 --> 01:11:22,810
Hold on, I'll see.

888
01:11:27,860 --> 01:11:30,190
It's for you, Roat Jr.

889
01:11:42,710 --> 01:11:47,590
-Hello? This is Harry Roat Jr.
-Mr. Roat, this is Mrs. Hendrix.

890
01:11:47,750 --> 01:11:51,220
My lawyer has advised me...

891
01:11:51,380 --> 01:11:55,090
...that if your father makes any more
accusations against my husband...

892
01:11:55,260 --> 01:11:59,850
...he will have to take immediate action.
Do you understand that, Mr. Roat?

893
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:03,980
Yes. Yes. Right.
Thank you, Mrs. Hendrix.

894
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:05,560
Thank you.

895
01:12:06,270 --> 01:12:10,570
That lawyer friend of yours isn't
going to stop me, Mrs. Hendrix.

896
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:13,910
Be right back. With a search warrant.

897
01:12:27,460 --> 01:12:29,750
Must be the wrong number.

898
01:12:31,630 --> 01:12:35,840
Like I said, I'll be right back.

899
01:12:36,090 --> 01:12:38,470
And don't forget...

900
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:42,810
...don't leave this house.

901
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:02,580
242-4598.

902
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:11,630
-Hello?
-Mike, is that you?

903
01:13:12,050 --> 01:13:17,010
-Yes, Susy. Is something the matter?
-I've got it. I've got the doll.

904
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,850
Great.

905
01:13:20,050 --> 01:13:21,310
Where was it?

906
01:13:21,510 --> 01:13:24,810
I'll tell you when you get here.
Can you come right over?

907
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:28,150
-I'll run all the way.
-Okay.

908
01:13:28,350 --> 01:13:31,820
Oh, and, Mike? Everything's gonna
be all right now, isn't it?

909
01:13:32,030 --> 01:13:35,490
Yes, Susy. Everything will be all right.

910
01:14:04,890 --> 01:14:06,430
Mike?

911
01:14:08,980 --> 01:14:10,610
No!

912
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:14,730
No.

913
01:14:16,440 --> 01:14:17,780
No.

914
01:14:19,240 --> 01:14:20,820
No.

915
01:14:32,170 --> 01:14:35,380
Carlino? No.

916
01:15:18,590 --> 01:15:22,340
-Operator.
-Operator, the police. Emergency...

917
01:15:22,510 --> 01:15:26,470
-Susy, it's me, Mike.
-You must have the wrong number.

918
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:30,640
Who was that? Who are you talking to?

919
01:15:30,810 --> 01:15:35,060
Some children. They call sometimes
and say cruel things.

920
01:15:35,230 --> 01:15:37,480
I don't suppose they mean it.

921
01:15:38,440 --> 01:15:41,780
The doll, Susy, where is it?
Where did you find it?

922
01:15:42,660 --> 01:15:46,120
That's the silly part. I don't know
why I didn't think of it.

923
01:15:46,330 --> 01:15:50,580
-I should have remembered ages ago.
-That doesn't matter. Where is it?

924
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:54,210
-You'll think I'm such a fool.
-Susy, don't complicate things.

925
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:57,960
-Give me the doll, then Sam will be safe.
-That's what's important.

926
01:15:58,130 --> 01:16:01,970
-If anything happened to Sam...
-Susy, where's the doll?

927
01:16:02,130 --> 01:16:07,100
I'll get it for you. Would you give me the
key ring that's on the nail by the icebox?

928
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:25,660
Are these the ones?

929
01:16:29,240 --> 01:16:30,500
Yes.

930
01:16:31,040 --> 01:16:37,130
-You wait here, Mike. I'll be right back.
-Wait a minute. Where are you going?

931
01:16:38,630 --> 01:16:41,380
To the studio. To Sam's studio.
That's where it is.

932
01:16:41,550 --> 01:16:44,340
How do you know the doll's
at his studio?

933
01:16:45,050 --> 01:16:48,300
Gloria just told me.
The little girl with the groceries.

934
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,520
She went over there to do an errand
for Sam, and she saw it.

935
01:16:51,720 --> 01:16:55,100
-And heard it. It played a little tune.
-Are you sure about this?

936
01:16:55,270 --> 01:16:58,980
Yes, positive. If it hadn't been for
Sgt. Carlino hounding me...

937
01:16:59,150 --> 01:17:01,190
...I could have told you earlier.

938
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:05,200
Okay, Susy, fine. I'll go get it.

939
01:17:07,660 --> 01:17:09,620
Where is the studio?

940
01:17:09,910 --> 01:17:15,750
Just two blocks away, 78 West Eighth St.
It's on the top floor.

941
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,710
And the desk is in the far corner,
away from the window.

942
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:22,550
It's a big old thing with a roller top.

943
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:26,380
You know the kind I mean, with
cubbyholes and pigeonholes and...

944
01:17:26,590 --> 01:17:31,640
-Yeah, I know the kind you mean.
-It's in the left-hand drawer, the doll.

945
01:17:31,810 --> 01:17:33,980
Gloria said so.

946
01:17:34,770 --> 01:17:38,770
Susy, I'm gonna ask you once more.
This is no time for mistakes.

947
01:17:38,940 --> 01:17:42,780
Are you sure the little girl saw the doll?
Are you sure this is all true?

948
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:46,280
I'm saving my husband's
life, aren't I, Mike?

949
01:17:49,280 --> 01:17:53,370
I'll be right back. You stay put.

950
01:17:53,950 --> 01:17:58,250
-Make a cup of hot coffee or something.
-Whatever you say, Mike.

951
01:19:09,700 --> 01:19:12,280
Susy! Susy, it's me.

952
01:19:14,700 --> 01:19:17,160
Those men who just went out,
who are they?

953
01:19:17,370 --> 01:19:21,330
-Where are they now?
-Careful. Two of them went up the street.

954
01:19:21,540 --> 01:19:25,000
-The one that looked in the window...
-Carlino. Yes?

955
01:19:25,210 --> 01:19:28,630
Well, he's outside.
Guarding or something.

956
01:19:31,970 --> 01:19:33,300
Now...

957
01:19:34,890 --> 01:19:38,270
...the first thing we have to do
is stay calm.

958
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:40,770
I'm calm, Susy.

959
01:19:42,230 --> 01:19:47,650
Yes, I know you are. I really know.
It's the best thing I ever heard.

960
01:19:47,820 --> 01:19:50,740
-Are they detectives?
-No, they're not detectives.

961
01:19:50,900 --> 01:19:53,620
They're sure not detectives.

962
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:57,910
The one out on the street,
can I get by him?

963
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,710
-Not without his seeing you.
-Then I have to stay here.

964
01:20:06,420 --> 01:20:09,090
-You've never really met him, have you?
-No.

965
01:20:09,260 --> 01:20:10,590
Good.

966
01:20:11,590 --> 01:20:14,890
You know the Port
Authority Bus Terminal?

967
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:19,680
It's near 42nd Street. Take a taxi.
The driver will know where it is.

968
01:20:19,850 --> 01:20:21,940
-42nd Street.
-Here. You'll need this.

969
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,600
What should I do?

970
01:20:23,770 --> 01:20:26,190
Ask if the bus has arrived from
Asbury Park.

971
01:20:26,360 --> 01:20:28,400
-Asbury Park. Say it.
-Asbury Park.

972
01:20:28,570 --> 01:20:32,240
Meet every bus from Asbury Park.
Stay all night if you have to.

973
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:34,700
Sam will be on one of them.
Can you do that?

974
01:20:34,860 --> 01:20:36,620
Of course. What shall I tell him?

975
01:20:36,780 --> 01:20:40,160
Everything. All about the three men.
Sam will know what to do.

976
01:20:40,330 --> 01:20:43,580
-As soon as you're safe, I'll call the police.
-Okay.

977
01:20:43,750 --> 01:20:47,170
I wish something like this
would happen every day.

978
01:21:02,230 --> 01:21:05,650
Oh, I'm a Girl Scout.
Wanna buy some cookies?

979
01:21:06,230 --> 01:21:10,400
Sure you don't wanna buy
a few boxes? I get points.

980
01:21:15,450 --> 01:21:17,410
Buzz off, kid.

981
01:21:17,780 --> 01:21:23,160
Well, okay. Guess I better try to make
points with someone else.

982
01:21:46,890 --> 01:21:48,480
Operator.

983
01:22:27,230 --> 01:22:30,270
No. No.

984
01:22:34,980 --> 01:22:38,660
Oh, no. No. No.

985
01:22:48,620 --> 01:22:51,880
They can't. They can't.

986
01:22:57,220 --> 01:23:02,220
They can't do this. Please, Sam! Sam!

987
01:23:10,140 --> 01:23:12,150
Oh, God.

988
01:25:38,460 --> 01:25:41,550
All right, all right,
I'll meet you in the parking lot.

989
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:48,890
Okay, bad man.

990
01:26:15,120 --> 01:26:16,660
Susy?

991
01:26:18,460 --> 01:26:21,420
Susy. It's me, Mike.

992
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:44,980
How long have you known?

993
01:26:45,780 --> 01:26:48,200
You've been to the studio, Mike.

994
01:26:48,990 --> 01:26:51,990
-Oh, that's right.
-And there was no doll.

995
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:57,290
More fun still, there wasn't even a desk.

996
01:26:57,500 --> 01:27:00,790
Poor Sam. He really ought
to have a desk.

997
01:27:00,960 --> 01:27:04,130
But you don't know Sam
and about him needing a desk.

998
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:08,550
-Mrs. Hendrix...
-Susy. We're not strangers.

999
01:27:09,680 --> 01:27:13,140
All right, Susy. Game time's over.
I want the doll.

1000
01:27:13,300 --> 01:27:14,640
No.

1001
01:27:14,850 --> 01:27:17,810
-I'm afraid you don't have any choice.
-Oh, but I do.

1002
01:27:18,020 --> 01:27:21,270
-I do have a choice.
-No, you don't.

1003
01:27:24,980 --> 01:27:27,530
Damn it, you act as if
you're in kindergarten.

1004
01:27:27,690 --> 01:27:31,910
This is the big, bad world full of mean
people, where nasty things happen.

1005
01:27:32,070 --> 01:27:33,740
Now you tell me.

1006
01:27:33,910 --> 01:27:37,910
Look, Susy, you listen to me,
and you listen to me good!

1007
01:27:38,080 --> 01:27:39,910
I'm through playing around.

1008
01:27:40,080 --> 01:27:43,170
You give me that doll,
and you give it to me fast!

1009
01:27:45,460 --> 01:27:47,420
Give it to me!

1010
01:28:09,650 --> 01:28:11,360
Okay, Susy.

1011
01:28:12,860 --> 01:28:14,370
You win.

1012
01:28:18,080 --> 01:28:23,170
Sam didn't kill that woman, did he,
Mike? He didn't even know her.

1013
01:28:24,880 --> 01:28:28,920
He met her at the airport,
just exactly like he told you.

1014
01:28:30,380 --> 01:28:32,760
Did you kill her, Mike?

1015
01:28:34,050 --> 01:28:37,510
-No.
-Mr. Roat?

1016
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:43,730
That isn't important.

1017
01:28:45,230 --> 01:28:50,990
It hasn't got anything to do with you
or with Sam. It never did.

1018
01:28:51,900 --> 01:28:56,240
It was a whole separate thing
for me and Carlino and Roat.

1019
01:28:57,910 --> 01:29:02,960
-You don't belong to any of it.
-It's different with Mr. Roat, isn't it?

1020
01:29:03,410 --> 01:29:06,580
I think it's more than the doll with him.

1021
01:29:07,840 --> 01:29:10,960
He said he wants to do evil things.

1022
01:29:11,970 --> 01:29:14,300
You don't have to worry about Roat.

1023
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:51,880
Roat's dead.

1024
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:58,850
He didn't like us, you know. Any of us.

1025
01:29:59,640 --> 01:30:05,640
So we had to get rid of him.
We flipped a coin. Carlino won.

1026
01:30:07,480 --> 01:30:09,610
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

1027
01:30:15,700 --> 01:30:18,320
What are you gonna do now, Mike?

1028
01:30:19,910 --> 01:30:22,660
Disappear. Like magic.

1029
01:30:28,880 --> 01:30:31,040
You're a good, strong lady...

1030
01:30:33,250 --> 01:30:36,720
-... Susy Hendrix.
-World's champion blind lady.

1031
01:30:37,220 --> 01:30:38,640
Oh, yeah.

1032
01:30:41,260 --> 01:30:43,010
You're all of that.

1033
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,440
-And, Susy?
-Yes?

1034
01:30:53,610 --> 01:30:55,360
I want you to know...

1035
01:30:56,900 --> 01:30:58,610
What is it?

1036
01:31:04,450 --> 01:31:05,750
Mike?

1037
01:31:12,590 --> 01:31:13,750
Mike!

1038
01:32:00,090 --> 01:32:03,760
What are you doing, Mr. Roat?

1039
01:32:10,140 --> 01:32:11,940
Gasoline!

1040
01:32:28,790 --> 01:32:30,370
Well, Susy...

1041
01:32:40,920 --> 01:32:45,180
Now all the children have gone
to bed, and we can talk.

1042
01:32:47,390 --> 01:32:51,430
-What are you gonna do with gasoline?
-Well, you just guess.

1043
01:33:03,780 --> 01:33:05,240
Now guess.

1044
01:33:12,160 --> 01:33:13,830
No!

1045
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:18,460
Please, no!

1046
01:33:20,210 --> 01:33:25,340
-All right!
-I thought that would save time.

1047
01:33:29,100 --> 01:33:30,430
I'll get you the doll.

1048
01:33:30,600 --> 01:33:33,730
Oh, that's a good girl.
Go to the head of the class.

1049
01:33:39,820 --> 01:33:41,070
Mike.

1050
01:33:51,080 --> 01:33:54,960
It's just a chair, Susy,
so you can sit down.

1051
01:33:59,340 --> 01:34:01,550
Did you know they wanted to kill me?

1052
01:34:01,750 --> 01:34:05,590
I did. I knew it even before they did.

1053
01:34:05,760 --> 01:34:09,640
They were awful amateurs, and that's
why you saw through them.

1054
01:34:09,800 --> 01:34:13,220
-I saw through you too.
-No, not all the way, Susy.

1055
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:15,850
Even now, not all the way.

1056
01:34:16,020 --> 01:34:18,900
The lovely thing was the way
I let them set it all up.

1057
01:34:19,110 --> 01:34:22,570
All that silliness of meeting
in the parking lot, the whole thing.

1058
01:34:22,780 --> 01:34:26,490
They had comic-book minds, so we did
it their way, right until the end.

1059
01:34:26,650 --> 01:34:31,740
And then topsy-turvy.
Me topsy and them turvy.

1060
01:34:32,790 --> 01:34:37,250
-Where's Sam? Where did you send him?
-Clever, Susy.

1061
01:34:37,420 --> 01:34:41,420
-Where is he?
-He's on his way to Bellevue Hospital.

1062
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:44,550
There was a message for him
when he got to Asbury Park.

1063
01:34:44,710 --> 01:34:46,720
One of those short, formal things.

1064
01:34:46,880 --> 01:34:49,590
Your wife has had a slight
accident, you know.

1065
01:34:49,800 --> 01:34:53,930
So he took the first bus
and is racing to your bedside.

1066
01:34:54,100 --> 01:34:56,140
So we don't have
too much time together.

1067
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:02,440
-You killed that woman, that doll woman.
-I don't wanna talk about Mrs. Roat.

1068
01:35:07,400 --> 01:35:10,660
-Are you gonna give me that doll, Susy?
-I can't...

1069
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:14,740
I don't believe you, Susy.

1070
01:35:16,410 --> 01:35:20,000
I can't! I don't have it anymore.

1071
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:23,840
Look, what is that? Stop it!

1072
01:35:24,000 --> 01:35:27,010
Now, I'm not gonna
ask you again, Susy.

1073
01:35:27,170 --> 01:35:30,220
When do you wanna tell me where?
You're gonna tell me.

1074
01:35:30,390 --> 01:35:34,640
-I can't! It isn't here!
-You're lying again.

1075
01:35:34,810 --> 01:35:38,810
-What is that?
-It's just...

1076
01:35:39,850 --> 01:35:41,940
It's just my hand.

1077
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,440
Well, now.

1078
01:35:47,190 --> 01:35:48,740
Why don't we stand up?

1079
01:35:51,410 --> 01:35:53,870
I said, stand up.

1080
01:36:03,040 --> 01:36:06,050
Now, go into the bedroom.

1081
01:36:07,380 --> 01:36:08,840
Mr. Roat?

1082
01:36:10,340 --> 01:36:13,640
-Are you looking at me?
-Yes, Susy...

1083
01:36:16,390 --> 01:36:17,720
Stop!

1084
01:36:18,770 --> 01:36:20,730
Don't touch that!

1085
01:36:31,400 --> 01:36:34,030
I have your knife, Mr. Roat.

1086
01:36:34,240 --> 01:36:38,620
And I've got the matches, Mrs. Hendrix.

1087
01:36:44,250 --> 01:36:45,500
No, no.

1088
01:36:45,670 --> 01:36:48,420
No, no, no! No more! No, no, no!

1089
01:36:48,590 --> 01:36:51,880
No! It's out! It's out. It's out, I said!

1090
01:36:52,090 --> 01:36:54,390
Cut it out!

1091
01:36:54,550 --> 01:36:56,260
Stop!

1092
01:36:56,430 --> 01:36:59,520
Try lighting your match now, Mr. Roat.

1093
01:36:59,680 --> 01:37:03,310
Throw your matches over to me. Go on.

1094
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:08,860
Don't move. I still have your knife.

1095
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:16,320
Pick up the cane.

1096
01:37:18,030 --> 01:37:22,000
Tap on the floor right where you are
so I know where you are. Go on. Tap.

1097
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:23,710
Tap.

1098
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,750
Keep tapping.

1099
01:37:27,340 --> 01:37:29,000
Keep tapping.

1100
01:37:30,300 --> 01:37:32,590
Keep tapping.

1101
01:37:33,510 --> 01:37:35,640
Tap.

1102
01:37:45,350 --> 01:37:47,690
Keep tapping.

1103
01:37:48,940 --> 01:37:52,150
Tap. Tap.

1104
01:37:52,320 --> 01:37:54,610
Tap.

1105
01:37:55,660 --> 01:37:57,780
Louder.

1106
01:38:00,160 --> 01:38:02,540
Louder!

1107
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:30,980
Tap.

1108
01:38:31,150 --> 01:38:33,030
Well, Susy.

1109
01:38:33,190 --> 01:38:35,650
It's all over.

1110
01:38:49,670 --> 01:38:52,000
Drop the knife.

1111
01:38:56,050 --> 01:38:58,470
And the matches.

1112
01:39:08,560 --> 01:39:10,100
Down we go.

1113
01:39:16,190 --> 01:39:18,030
All right.

1114
01:39:18,240 --> 01:39:22,580
All right, you can have it.
You can have the doll.

1115
01:39:23,990 --> 01:39:28,710
I'll give it to you
if you'll just go and...

1116
01:39:29,750 --> 01:39:33,540
-Yes, Susy?
-Not hurt me.

1117
01:39:33,710 --> 01:39:35,380
Say, "please."

1118
01:39:38,130 --> 01:39:41,010
-Please.
-No, that's not quite it.

1119
01:39:41,180 --> 01:39:44,100
"Please may I give you the doll?"

1120
01:39:49,850 --> 01:39:53,230
Please may I give you the doll?

1121
01:39:53,440 --> 01:39:55,480
You may.

1122
01:40:14,710 --> 01:40:16,710
The doll.

1123
01:40:30,640 --> 01:40:33,190
Catchy tune.

1124
01:41:07,350 --> 01:41:10,680
Well, Susy, now I want you in the bedroom.

1125
01:41:10,850 --> 01:41:12,980
-You said you wouldn't hurt me.
-Did I?

1126
01:41:13,140 --> 01:41:16,440
I must've had my fingers crossed.

1127
01:41:19,570 --> 01:41:21,900
Good girl.

1128
01:41:51,640 --> 01:41:53,520
Help!

1129
01:41:53,730 --> 01:41:55,850
Help!

1130
01:41:56,060 --> 01:41:57,060
Help!

1131
01:41:57,440 --> 01:42:00,230
Help!

1132
01:42:03,070 --> 01:42:05,450
Window.

1133
01:43:27,070 --> 01:43:29,660
Where is it?

1134
01:43:32,950 --> 01:43:35,370
Where is it?! Oh, God!

1135
01:43:55,180 --> 01:43:57,140
Wait! Wait!

1136
01:43:57,350 --> 01:43:59,190
You stay here. Do you understand?

1137
01:44:05,360 --> 01:44:08,240
All right, come on. Look out.

1138
01:44:10,740 --> 01:44:12,280
Hurry!

1139
01:44:12,490 --> 01:44:13,950
Here! Let me try.

1140
01:44:14,120 --> 01:44:16,370
Take it easy.

1141
01:44:24,500 --> 01:44:25,960
Don't waste your time.

1142
01:44:26,130 --> 01:44:28,130
Susy!

1143
01:44:29,920 --> 01:44:31,970
Susy, where are you?

1144
01:44:32,140 --> 01:44:34,100
-Susy!
-You know this man?

1145
01:44:34,260 --> 01:44:37,060
No. Susy, for God's sake, where...?

1146
01:44:37,220 --> 01:44:39,560
Must be in the bedroom.

1147
01:44:41,060 --> 01:44:42,310
I tried. It won't work.

1148
01:44:42,480 --> 01:44:45,900
All right, bring your flashlight.
I got some bulbs in here.

1149
01:44:52,820 --> 01:44:56,620
My God, where is she?
I'm gonna have another look in the...

1150
01:45:05,000 --> 01:45:07,840
God in heaven.

1151
01:45:11,670 --> 01:45:14,720
-Susy! Susy!
-Wait!

1152
01:45:16,100 --> 01:45:18,770
Sam?

1153
01:45:20,560 --> 01:45:22,310
Over here, Susy.

1154
01:45:22,480 --> 01:45:24,600
I'm over here.

1155
01:45:24,770 --> 01:45:27,230
You're by the chair.

1156
01:45:27,860 --> 01:45:31,280
Great girl.

1157
01:45:33,660 --> 01:45:36,070
I'm over here.

1158
01:45:42,620 --> 01:45:45,210
You're doing fine.

1159
01:45:45,380 --> 01:45:47,590
Just fine.

1160
01:45:51,710 --> 01:45:54,300
Sammy!

1161
01:47:39,570 --> 01:47:40,570
