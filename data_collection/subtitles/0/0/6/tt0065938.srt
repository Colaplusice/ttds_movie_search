1
00:04:26,613 --> 00:04:27,955
Come on, Colonel.

2
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:31,603
-Get that jeep out of here.
-Right, Kelly.

3
00:04:34,262 --> 00:04:36,466
We've been here for two hours.

4
00:04:36,822 --> 00:04:39,310
No, that's Map Section 3, not 4.

5
00:04:40,566 --> 00:04:43,948
I don't give a damn what Command says
about anything!

6
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,240
Mulligan, I don't think
I'm getting through to you!

7
00:04:48,311 --> 00:04:50,733
You're dropping your damn barrage
on our position!

8
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,175
Sit and see.

9
00:04:52,246 --> 00:04:54,734
You can't hear me?
The reason you can't hear me...

10
00:04:54,999 --> 00:04:57,683
...is because you're firing your mortar
at your end...

11
00:04:57,751 --> 00:05:00,173
...and they're dropping here at our end!

12
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:02,831
No, the Krauts are not here!

13
00:05:02,999 --> 00:05:04,079
We're here!

14
00:05:05,015 --> 00:05:07,568
Mulligan, your bombs are coming down
on our heads!

15
00:05:07,896 --> 00:05:09,619
I don't know where the Krauts are!

16
00:05:09,784 --> 00:05:12,533
Just lift your goddamned barrage! Over!

17
00:05:17,112 --> 00:05:20,887
I told you to bring me a good looking kid,
not this fat, sausage-chewing wino!

18
00:05:21,048 --> 00:05:24,878
Well, if you were looking for a young boy,
you should've sent somebody else.

19
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:33,938
Mulligan, you son of a bitch!

20
00:05:35,066 --> 00:05:36,854
They're trying to push up the canal!

21
00:05:36,922 --> 00:05:39,061
What do you want me to do
about it, Petuko?

22
00:05:39,321 --> 00:05:41,077
The halftrack's been wiped out!

23
00:05:41,145 --> 00:05:42,738
And he's been hit.

24
00:05:43,161 --> 00:05:47,155
Go see what's happening. Grace! Jonesy!
Grab a litter and go with Corporal Job.

25
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:48,984
On the double!

26
00:05:50,106 --> 00:05:51,350
Mickey Mouse.

27
00:05:51,801 --> 00:05:54,387
-It's Mulligan.
-What the hell does he want?

28
00:05:54,458 --> 00:05:55,866
He says he's sorry.

29
00:05:55,931 --> 00:05:57,458
Sorry. Son of a bitch!

30
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:03,507
Big Joe's a little upset right now.
I think maybe you should leave town.

31
00:06:03,578 --> 00:06:05,684
Get out of the neighborhood.

32
00:06:05,787 --> 00:06:06,770
Right.

33
00:06:07,163 --> 00:06:08,854
Does he speak English?

34
00:06:08,923 --> 00:06:11,509
Yeah, he's a Colonel in lntelligence.

35
00:06:13,883 --> 00:06:17,877
As a big shot with the German lntelligence
you should be able to tell us about Nancy.

36
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:20,566
-Under the Geneva Convention you only--
-Sit down!

37
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,214
I'm not interested in defenses,
I'm interested in hotels. Okay?

38
00:06:25,180 --> 00:06:27,123
Are there any still standing?

39
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:29,721
There are three.
Two are defended by units of--

40
00:06:30,236 --> 00:06:31,763
Which is the most comfortable?

41
00:06:32,444 --> 00:06:33,459
I don't know.

42
00:06:34,173 --> 00:06:37,108
Think of us as tourists.
I don't want any military information.

43
00:06:37,181 --> 00:06:39,002
I just want to know the best hotel.

44
00:06:40,412 --> 00:06:42,136
I think it is called the Majestic.

45
00:06:42,205 --> 00:06:43,252
Who's the owner?

46
00:06:44,285 --> 00:06:45,976
I can't remember his name.

47
00:06:46,302 --> 00:06:49,203
All right. Check the Michelin Guide.

48
00:06:49,309 --> 00:06:50,323
What about women?

49
00:06:51,901 --> 00:06:55,131
I must warn you. The German Army
is preparing a counter attack.

50
00:06:55,230 --> 00:06:56,342
Sit down!

51
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:59,444
Look, we're not worried
about the German Army.

52
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:02,682
We've got enough troubles of our own.
To the right, General Patton.

53
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:06,296
To the left, the British Army.
To the rear, our own goddamned artillery.

54
00:07:06,367 --> 00:07:09,715
Besides all that, it's raining.
And the good thing about the weather is...

55
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:12,212
...it keeps our Air Corps
from blowing us to hell...

56
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:14,459
...because it's too lousy to fly. Verstehen?

57
00:07:15,359 --> 00:07:17,530
-Ich verstehe.
-Okay.

58
00:07:20,895 --> 00:07:22,488
What about the broads in Nancy?

59
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:24,090
Broads?

60
00:07:24,352 --> 00:07:25,300
The women!

61
00:07:25,952 --> 00:07:29,246
Yes, there is a house.
I cannot give you the directions.

62
00:07:29,312 --> 00:07:30,556
I've never been there.

63
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:33,340
Here it is. "Nancy.

64
00:07:33,856 --> 00:07:35,133
"Principle attractions:

65
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:38,745
"The church of the Cordeliers tombs.
Woodwork and statues.

66
00:07:38,816 --> 00:07:42,843
"City Hall, 18th century,
with stairway and square reception room.

67
00:07:43,168 --> 00:07:45,340
"Place Stanislas. Impressive gates.

68
00:07:45,729 --> 00:07:48,216
"Porterie, Museum of Lorrain.
Charge to see--"

69
00:07:48,288 --> 00:07:51,420
Will you cut the culture crap
and get to the hotels?

70
00:07:52,417 --> 00:07:55,286
Majestic Hotel, three stars,
a knife and a fork.

71
00:07:55,361 --> 00:07:56,538
Beautiful.

72
00:07:57,057 --> 00:08:00,669
We'll keep this guy until we get to Nancy.
We can use him when we get to town.

73
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,464
What do you want, Barbara?

74
00:08:02,689 --> 00:08:04,217
The Captain wants to see you.

75
00:08:05,090 --> 00:08:06,366
I'll be right with you.

76
00:08:06,433 --> 00:08:08,288
-What should I do?
-Stay on the radio.

77
00:08:08,353 --> 00:08:10,842
I think we ought to send him back
to interrogation.

78
00:08:11,202 --> 00:08:13,723
Nobody's copping out on this.
Do you understand?

79
00:08:13,794 --> 00:08:16,379
He serves a more strategic purpose
by staying with us.

80
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:18,905
If he needs interrogating,
then you do it right here.

81
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:20,091
Open the door.

82
00:08:25,155 --> 00:08:27,226
-What do you want?
-Do me a favor, will you?

83
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:28,859
-What?
-Don't call me Barbara.

84
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:31,615
-That's your name, isn't it?
-But, my name's Babra.

85
00:08:31,683 --> 00:08:33,920
-Come on, will you?
-But, I only wanted to....

86
00:08:51,492 --> 00:08:52,834
What are these, Colonel?

87
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:55,649
Just my orders and letters of transport.

88
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,242
Fisher?

89
00:08:57,956 --> 00:08:59,483
What are you transporting?

90
00:08:59,589 --> 00:09:00,571
Files.

91
00:09:01,733 --> 00:09:02,846
What kind of files?

92
00:09:03,685 --> 00:09:04,797
Clerical.

93
00:09:07,109 --> 00:09:09,498
Mind telling me what you were doing
in this area?

94
00:09:09,573 --> 00:09:12,191
I needed petrol for my trucks.
The bombing....

95
00:09:12,422 --> 00:09:14,330
Trucks won't move without petrol.

96
00:09:18,086 --> 00:09:19,166
What do you want?

97
00:09:19,238 --> 00:09:21,180
Interpret these for me, will you?

98
00:09:25,189 --> 00:09:26,237
What are these?

99
00:09:27,110 --> 00:09:28,287
Lead bars.

100
00:09:28,390 --> 00:09:29,318
Lead?

101
00:09:30,502 --> 00:09:33,436
Yes, the bag was supposed
to have been dropped in the water...

102
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:34,820
...in case of capture.

103
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:37,252
Unfortunately, you surprised me.

104
00:09:37,414 --> 00:09:41,309
All these papers are about some kind
of convoy from France to Germany.

105
00:09:41,511 --> 00:09:43,398
Code name is Tannenbaum.

106
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,790
Travel reports are a shipment of--

107
00:09:45,895 --> 00:09:47,041
That's enough.

108
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:49,278
Thanks!

109
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,086
Colonel....

110
00:09:55,207 --> 00:09:56,451
Come here, Colonel.

111
00:09:56,615 --> 00:09:59,333
Oh, Little Joe,
give me that brandy, will you?

112
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:01,734
-What for?
-Just give me the brandy!

113
00:10:01,897 --> 00:10:06,053
Kelly, what do you want to give away
the good brandy to the Kraut for?

114
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:08,102
This way, Colonel.

115
00:10:09,256 --> 00:10:10,369
Over here.

116
00:10:11,433 --> 00:10:13,058
Sit down on this bench.

117
00:10:20,009 --> 00:10:21,733
I want you to have a drink.

118
00:10:21,833 --> 00:10:25,281
-Under the Geneva Convention--
-This isn't Geneva, Colonel.

119
00:10:25,385 --> 00:10:28,320
I just want to have a nice sociable talk
with you, that's all.

120
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:32,158
Go ahead.

121
00:10:32,553 --> 00:10:33,251
Drink!

122
00:10:33,321 --> 00:10:35,777
But I will not divulge
any further information.

123
00:10:36,714 --> 00:10:37,696
Drink!

124
00:10:43,818 --> 00:10:45,378
You idiot! Hold it!

125
00:10:46,923 --> 00:10:48,352
Come on, cover me.

126
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,258
-Mitchell?
-Yeah?

127
00:11:01,419 --> 00:11:02,499
Big Joe.

128
00:11:03,723 --> 00:11:05,665
All right, you stay here.

129
00:11:07,628 --> 00:11:09,221
-Where is he?
-Inside.

130
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:14,794
Captain?

131
00:11:15,020 --> 00:11:16,449
Yeah, who is it?

132
00:11:16,524 --> 00:11:18,215
It's me, Big Joe. Where are you?

133
00:11:18,828 --> 00:11:19,690
I'm in here.

134
00:11:21,324 --> 00:11:24,172
-What are you doing there, sir?
-I'm checking out the motor.

135
00:11:24,236 --> 00:11:25,643
The motor? What for?

136
00:11:26,156 --> 00:11:29,899
We're pulling out and I want to see if
this boat's worth taking back to the base.

137
00:11:29,965 --> 00:11:31,241
What about Nancy?

138
00:11:31,308 --> 00:11:34,243
Third Army's taking over.
We go into reserve.

139
00:11:34,317 --> 00:11:36,684
When they take Nancy,
we go back in the line.

140
00:11:37,710 --> 00:11:40,327
I don't think you have the welfare
of your men at heart.

141
00:11:40,461 --> 00:11:43,690
This is a big town,
with a lot of passionate broads...

142
00:11:43,758 --> 00:11:46,758
...great restaurants, feather beds
in rooms with hot water....

143
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:50,953
Look, Captain, we've been rained on,
pushed on, bombed on...

144
00:11:51,021 --> 00:11:54,186
...mortared on by Mulligan all the way
from the Normandy Beachhead.

145
00:11:55,054 --> 00:11:56,909
I'm aware of that problem, Sergeant.

146
00:11:57,103 --> 00:12:01,259
You've been aware of that problem ever
since we got out of the water at Omaha!

147
00:12:01,518 --> 00:12:04,814
Look, why is it that every time
we get to a town like Nancy...

148
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:07,334
...these guys with the clean uniforms
and the ties...

149
00:12:07,407 --> 00:12:10,156
...get to ride in the trucks into town
and make their pitch?

150
00:12:10,222 --> 00:12:12,678
The General says we pull out,
so we pull out.

151
00:12:12,847 --> 00:12:15,597
Look, Captain! You can't let them do this!

152
00:12:16,656 --> 00:12:19,917
I must get my men near some broads
before they start freaking-out.

153
00:12:19,983 --> 00:12:22,701
I'm aware that,
that situation might be developing.

154
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:25,005
Think I could get this in the hold of a B-17?

155
00:12:25,232 --> 00:12:27,534
We're point section
to the whole damn Army!

156
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,355
Nancy's our town, Captain!

157
00:12:29,936 --> 00:12:32,303
Babra says there's a company
of Germans pushing up.

158
00:12:32,368 --> 00:12:34,540
I'll be with you in a minute! Captain!

159
00:12:34,609 --> 00:12:36,846
We got it all figured out.
We even got a guide!

160
00:12:36,913 --> 00:12:40,971
-All we have to do is get in there!
-These German divisions say you can't.

161
00:12:41,233 --> 00:12:42,662
So we need a little help!

162
00:12:42,737 --> 00:12:44,876
All I need is to get this yacht out of here.

163
00:12:44,945 --> 00:12:47,815
Get back to the barn.
I'll get the engineers and do it myself.

164
00:12:47,890 --> 00:12:50,191
You're supposed to be
in charge of this outfit!

165
00:12:50,545 --> 00:12:53,360
You're doing such a good job.
Why should I get in your way?

166
00:12:56,626 --> 00:12:57,674
Hey, Cowboy!

167
00:12:58,673 --> 00:13:02,929
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated.

168
00:13:05,010 --> 00:13:09,134
Hold it down there a bit, Willard.
The Corporal's trying to tell us something.

169
00:13:09,202 --> 00:13:11,057
Yes, sir. You're telling me what?

170
00:13:11,122 --> 00:13:15,247
There are three tanks coming up the road.
I suggest you get activated!

171
00:13:15,539 --> 00:13:18,408
Now, come on, pal!
Ain't you got any Shermans?

172
00:13:18,482 --> 00:13:20,752
We've been polishing these things
for two days!

173
00:13:20,819 --> 00:13:23,787
If we take them out there in that rain,
they'll rust up on us.

174
00:13:23,859 --> 00:13:25,234
Don't give me a hard time.

175
00:13:25,299 --> 00:13:27,087
Get off your ass, and get out there!

176
00:13:27,539 --> 00:13:29,644
Yes, sir. I didn't mean nothing!

177
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,392
I was just trying to tell you
how we're feeling, ain't that right, Willy?

178
00:13:33,683 --> 00:13:37,327
"Hold the ground at all costs"?
But we're a reconnaissance company!

179
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,298
It's not our job to hold the ground!
That's an infantry's job!

180
00:13:40,372 --> 00:13:42,445
We're supposed to go out
and find someplace...

181
00:13:42,517 --> 00:13:45,419
...look at it and tell you
what the situation is.

182
00:13:46,612 --> 00:13:49,482
I can tell you what the situation is!
It stinks!

183
00:13:49,589 --> 00:13:52,306
It's wet, it's cold,
and we're under heavy fire!

184
00:13:53,301 --> 00:13:54,927
Yes! Yes!

185
00:13:56,340 --> 00:13:58,315
Are they sending anything to support us?

186
00:13:58,389 --> 00:14:01,685
They say they haven't got anything.
We've been ordered to hold.

187
00:14:01,749 --> 00:14:04,335
-Hold! With what?
-That's what I told them!

188
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:08,910
You think we ought to pull out?

189
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:13,231
I don't know. Better wait for Big Joe.

190
00:14:13,622 --> 00:14:17,615
Those are not Mulligan's mortars anymore.
Those are German 88s!

191
00:14:17,942 --> 00:14:22,318
As much as I like Big Joe, I don't want
to spend the rest of the war in a camp.

192
00:14:22,423 --> 00:14:26,284
Besides which, I'm first-generation ltalian,
they'd shoot me as a traitor.

193
00:14:26,358 --> 00:14:29,588
The indications are the Germans
are coming and we won't stop them.

194
00:14:29,655 --> 00:14:33,518
With your permission, I'll pull the vehicle
to the other side of the canal.

195
00:14:36,247 --> 00:14:37,108
Yeah, go on.

196
00:14:37,847 --> 00:14:40,182
Penn, Fisher! Get that damn thing
out of here!

197
00:14:40,247 --> 00:14:42,931
Okay, everybody!
We're pulling out on the double!

198
00:14:43,736 --> 00:14:44,914
Move that stretcher!

199
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:50,066
God damn it, Cowboy!

200
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:54,613
I don't know what you was talking about!
There ain't three tanks, there's about 20!

201
00:14:54,681 --> 00:14:56,371
-Ain't that right, Willy?
-Right.

202
00:14:56,504 --> 00:14:59,221
Get that thing to the other side
of the canal, you maniac!

203
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:02,255
Well, that's what we was figuring on doing.

204
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:08,910
Kelly, come on, we're going.

205
00:15:08,985 --> 00:15:10,643
You're coming, ain't you?

206
00:15:10,905 --> 00:15:11,766
Go on ahead.

207
00:15:12,058 --> 00:15:13,651
All right, good luck!

208
00:15:13,754 --> 00:15:15,476
Okay, Penn, let's go!

209
00:16:12,413 --> 00:16:15,380
How many more bars of gold like this
do you have in that convoy?

210
00:16:16,285 --> 00:16:17,300
Vierzehn.

211
00:16:17,533 --> 00:16:19,159
Come on, speak English, Colonel.

212
00:16:20,285 --> 00:16:22,227
How many bars like this in your trucks?

213
00:16:24,381 --> 00:16:25,329
Fourteen.

214
00:16:25,725 --> 00:16:26,674
Fourteen what?

215
00:16:27,069 --> 00:16:28,018
Thousand.

216
00:16:30,782 --> 00:16:32,211
Fourteen thousand?

217
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,248
Where is your convoy right now?

218
00:16:41,343 --> 00:16:43,131
Where are your trucks?

219
00:16:44,286 --> 00:16:45,301
Clermont.

220
00:16:45,374 --> 00:16:47,284
In Clermont. Clermont?

221
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:49,624
Is the gold still in the trucks?

222
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:52,696
Nein!

223
00:16:54,494 --> 00:16:56,502
Whereabouts? Whereabouts is the gold?

224
00:16:57,375 --> 00:16:58,804
In the bank.

225
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:04,860
Colonel? Wake up, wake up.
What about support units?

226
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:06,615
Support?

227
00:17:06,752 --> 00:17:07,613
Yeah, tanks.

228
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:10,749
Come on, tanks. Stuff like that.

229
00:17:12,448 --> 00:17:13,560
Tanks!

230
00:17:14,495 --> 00:17:16,732
Three Tiger tanks.

231
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:18,491
What about infantry?

232
00:17:20,193 --> 00:17:22,396
What about infantry, Colonel?

233
00:17:35,137 --> 00:17:37,952
-Did you hear from Headquarters?
-We've been ordered to hold.

234
00:17:38,018 --> 00:17:41,083
I'll tell them what to hold!
The Third took over one hour ago!

235
00:17:41,153 --> 00:17:42,877
-We're pulling out of here!
-Great!

236
00:17:42,945 --> 00:17:45,498
-Where's Maitland?
-He's salvaging a yacht.

237
00:17:45,570 --> 00:17:46,683
-A yacht?
-A yacht!

238
00:17:47,074 --> 00:17:49,977
-I'll see you about 10 miles down the road.
-Wait a minute!

239
00:17:50,146 --> 00:17:53,758
-Is everybody across the bridge?
-Kelly's still in the barn with that Colonel.

240
00:17:53,826 --> 00:17:56,729
-Did you tell him we're pulling out?
-We told him. He's crazy!

241
00:17:57,443 --> 00:18:01,217
Tell Mulligan to give me three minutes
and lay all the mortar into that barn.

242
00:18:01,314 --> 00:18:03,038
-Do you understand?
-If you say so.

243
00:18:03,106 --> 00:18:04,154
You wait here.

244
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,172
Mulligan!

245
00:18:07,619 --> 00:18:09,442
Come on, Colonel. Come on.

246
00:18:10,755 --> 00:18:12,730
Get up and sit right here.

247
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,940
Kelly! Halfthe German Army's
coming up the road.

248
00:18:27,172 --> 00:18:30,270
In minutes, Mulligan will drop
10 tons of mortar on this joint!

249
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,023
-What the are you doing?
-I'm looking after the Colonel.

250
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:35,231
Shoot him and let's get the hell
out of here!

251
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:37,089
Shoot him, we don't get the gold.

252
00:18:37,157 --> 00:18:38,051
What gold?

253
00:18:38,118 --> 00:18:41,379
The gold that's in a bank 25 miles east
of Nancy, that's what.

254
00:18:42,085 --> 00:18:45,860
Mulligan, I said three minutes!
Come on, let's get out of here!

255
00:19:09,766 --> 00:19:11,522
Kelly? You okay, Kelly?

256
00:19:11,846 --> 00:19:12,992
Yeah, I'm all right.

257
00:19:16,616 --> 00:19:19,266
Come on, you nut!
Let's get the hell out of here!

258
00:19:29,159 --> 00:19:32,225
Fisher! Petuko! Come on,
we're moving out! Move it out!

259
00:19:32,743 --> 00:19:35,711
Move it out! Babra! Come on! Move it!

260
00:19:37,033 --> 00:19:38,439
Get in, we're pulling out!

261
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:01,695
Kelly, you nut!

262
00:20:01,994 --> 00:20:03,074
Come on!

263
00:20:41,004 --> 00:20:43,371
Wait a minute, will you?
Will you wait a minute?

264
00:20:43,436 --> 00:20:46,370
Listen to me a second.
It's not me, I tell you. It's not me!

265
00:20:46,444 --> 00:20:49,259
I can't tell one shell from another!
They all look alike.

266
00:20:49,324 --> 00:20:50,601
They all look alike.

267
00:20:50,668 --> 00:20:53,221
If it was me....
If I could tell, would I be here?

268
00:20:53,292 --> 00:20:55,877
Would I be here? I wouldn't be here, Kelly!

269
00:20:55,948 --> 00:20:59,724
I'd be in the States checking out the duds.
I'd be out with all those broads!

270
00:20:59,789 --> 00:21:01,796
-I'd be working in a factory.
-Relax.

271
00:21:01,869 --> 00:21:05,098
Wait a minute! We've got to have
a little understanding around here.

272
00:21:05,164 --> 00:21:08,263
How the hell do we ever get
any understanding around here, Kelly?

273
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,315
Relax.

274
00:21:11,533 --> 00:21:13,802
Mulligan, I just want
to make you a proposition.

275
00:21:16,429 --> 00:21:17,377
A proposition?

276
00:21:22,702 --> 00:21:25,068
Well, is it dirty, or just illegal?

277
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:31,658
I want you to set up a barrage for me.

278
00:21:32,847 --> 00:21:35,148
I want you to lay down a barrage for me.

279
00:21:35,214 --> 00:21:37,898
Grid section 7,
right here at these crossroads.

280
00:21:39,503 --> 00:21:41,772
I got to have a signed order from the C.O.

281
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,498
I need an authorization.

282
00:21:43,631 --> 00:21:47,275
You see, that's just the problem, Mulligan.
We don't have an authorization.

283
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:49,126
You don't have a....

284
00:21:49,487 --> 00:21:52,237
Kelly, without an authorization,
I can't help you.

285
00:21:53,743 --> 00:21:57,322
I told you I had a proposition, Mulligan.
That's just what I meant.

286
00:21:58,128 --> 00:21:59,502
A proposition.

287
00:22:12,529 --> 00:22:13,357
Why?

288
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,749
Why what?

289
00:22:16,401 --> 00:22:17,481
Why....

290
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,009
Why not?

291
00:22:23,089 --> 00:22:24,845
You won't forget me now, will you?

292
00:22:24,913 --> 00:22:26,823
Why, no. I won't forget, Kelly.

293
00:22:27,666 --> 00:22:29,095
You're a good man, Mulligan.

294
00:22:46,771 --> 00:22:48,462
-Come on!
-Screw you, Mac!

295
00:22:48,531 --> 00:22:49,676
Come on, move it!

296
00:22:49,875 --> 00:22:50,857
Up yours, baby!

297
00:22:51,507 --> 00:22:53,361
Hey, come on, get it out of there!

298
00:22:53,779 --> 00:22:54,640
Come on!

299
00:22:54,707 --> 00:22:56,682
Hey, come on, come on. Move it!

300
00:22:57,971 --> 00:23:00,689
All right, come on, you guys!
Clear it out! Clear it out!

301
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:04,169
Come on, get the horse out of here!
Get on the side, will you?

302
00:23:04,691 --> 00:23:06,764
Move it out, come on now!
Move it, move it!

303
00:23:08,468 --> 00:23:10,802
Keep it going, boys. Move it through.

304
00:23:10,869 --> 00:23:12,875
All right, keep it going. Let's go.

305
00:23:13,076 --> 00:23:14,702
A message from Captain Maitland.

306
00:23:14,772 --> 00:23:16,113
-Did you read it?
-Yeah.

307
00:23:16,181 --> 00:23:18,701
-What's it say?
-He wanted you to read it, Joe.

308
00:23:19,028 --> 00:23:21,777
Take the underwear off your head.
Enough is enough.

309
00:23:24,692 --> 00:23:26,449
We've been ordered to pull back.

310
00:23:26,869 --> 00:23:28,560
We've been ordered to pull back.

311
00:23:28,885 --> 00:23:30,260
Yeah, I heard.

312
00:23:30,549 --> 00:23:31,476
All right!

313
00:23:31,956 --> 00:23:35,732
We've been ordered back
to map reference 473, so let's move it!

314
00:23:35,957 --> 00:23:38,063
But my hair is still in curlers!

315
00:23:38,134 --> 00:23:39,890
That's telling them, Willard!

316
00:23:40,278 --> 00:23:41,684
Come on, let's move it out.

317
00:23:41,750 --> 00:23:43,539
Joe, what about Nancy?

318
00:23:44,150 --> 00:23:45,644
Pack it up, let's move.

319
00:23:47,511 --> 00:23:49,453
Move them out, will you, Corporal?

320
00:23:56,535 --> 00:23:57,779
Where have you been?

321
00:23:58,007 --> 00:24:00,015
-Checking a few things out.
-Like what?

322
00:24:01,047 --> 00:24:02,672
I'm going after that gold, Joe.

323
00:24:03,286 --> 00:24:04,530
That's what I thought.

324
00:24:04,599 --> 00:24:05,646
Do you want in?

325
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,864
Do I want in?

326
00:24:08,183 --> 00:24:10,866
Let me tell you something,
I'll say it nice and clear.

327
00:24:10,935 --> 00:24:14,448
I got a job to do and that is
to get you guys to Berlin alive.

328
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:16,941
We've been at the front end
of this war all the way.

329
00:24:17,016 --> 00:24:19,504
If you whisper one word
about the gold to the guys...

330
00:24:19,575 --> 00:24:23,318
...l'll bounce you from this outfit so fast
your feet won't even touch the ground.

331
00:24:23,384 --> 00:24:24,497
Do you understand?

332
00:24:25,016 --> 00:24:26,772
Yeah. Yeah, I understand.

333
00:24:27,321 --> 00:24:30,866
You'd better fix up some transfer papers
for me, because I'm going.

334
00:24:31,032 --> 00:24:32,592
With you or without you.

335
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,648
Okay.

336
00:24:44,409 --> 00:24:48,119
-Come on, give me a hand down there.
-What a bunch of shit this is!

337
00:25:02,426 --> 00:25:05,743
Sergeant, everything's secure up here.
I'm coming down now.

338
00:25:15,963 --> 00:25:17,076
Hi, Captain.

339
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:20,372
Sergeant, do you think I can get this yacht
to Paris by Sunday?

340
00:25:20,443 --> 00:25:23,672
You didn't bring me to this farmhouse
to talk about this boat again?

341
00:25:23,739 --> 00:25:27,285
I made a deal with Headquarters.
I have three days rest for you and the men.

342
00:25:27,356 --> 00:25:28,981
Make sure they have a good time.

343
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:32,248
I must get this yacht to Paris
and get some things for the General.

344
00:25:32,315 --> 00:25:34,104
And where do we spend this vacation?

345
00:25:34,172 --> 00:25:35,579
Right here, Sergeant.

346
00:25:39,420 --> 00:25:40,468
Are you kidding?

347
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,836
I'm not kidding. With a little imagination,
you can fix this place up.

348
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:46,683
Lay out a baseball diamond.
Run the water into the house.

349
00:25:46,749 --> 00:25:49,847
Special service is coming by
with some magazines and paperbacks.

350
00:25:49,916 --> 00:25:51,957
We're 10 miles from the nearest town!

351
00:25:52,029 --> 00:25:53,305
There's no action!

352
00:25:53,373 --> 00:25:56,243
That's the beautiful thing
about this location. It's quiet.

353
00:25:56,317 --> 00:25:59,862
Get yourselves a suntan, a little rest.
In three days we're back in the line.

354
00:26:01,341 --> 00:26:04,091
-We're all ready to move out!
-Yeah, I'm coming. Go ahead.

355
00:26:04,158 --> 00:26:06,710
There's no booze, there's no broads,
there's no action!

356
00:26:06,781 --> 00:26:07,959
That's another thing.

357
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:10,648
Don't fool around with the women,
their husbands carry guns.

358
00:26:10,717 --> 00:26:12,954
Don't forget, the penalty
for looting is death!

359
00:26:13,502 --> 00:26:15,924
Loot what? There's nothing here to loot!

360
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,228
I'll be back in three days.

361
00:26:28,062 --> 00:26:30,812
"Get yourself a suntan and get some rest."

362
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,017
He's got to be out of his mind!

363
00:26:33,407 --> 00:26:36,440
But how does he get away with it?
That's what I'd like to know.

364
00:26:36,511 --> 00:26:39,741
Very simple. The General's his uncle,
that's how.

365
00:27:19,618 --> 00:27:20,600
Crapgame?

366
00:27:21,249 --> 00:27:22,395
What do you want?

367
00:27:23,234 --> 00:27:25,241
I want to talk to you for a few minutes.

368
00:27:26,690 --> 00:27:27,618
What about?

369
00:27:29,442 --> 00:27:32,061
I have this deal I've been working on.

370
00:27:32,707 --> 00:27:36,023
I thought you might be interested
in helping me out.

371
00:27:36,803 --> 00:27:38,396
What kind of deal?

372
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:40,096
A private deal.

373
00:27:40,675 --> 00:27:42,563
Harry, go get yourself a haircut.

374
00:27:45,219 --> 00:27:48,066
I hear Maitland's got himself a yacht
and taking it to Paris.

375
00:27:48,259 --> 00:27:49,187
That's right.

376
00:27:49,251 --> 00:27:51,968
There's no money in yachts.
What does he want a yacht for?

377
00:27:52,036 --> 00:27:55,035
Who cares, as long as it keeps him
out of our hair for a few days?

378
00:27:56,004 --> 00:27:57,182
Okay, Kelly.

379
00:27:58,276 --> 00:27:59,967
What is it? What is it you want?

380
00:28:01,669 --> 00:28:05,694
Well, I want 15 Thompson's,
two .30 caliber machine guns...

381
00:28:05,796 --> 00:28:07,836
...two bazookas, two field radios...

382
00:28:08,548 --> 00:28:12,804
...and supplies and ammunition to last
a platoon of men in the field for three days.

383
00:28:12,997 --> 00:28:13,944
Is that all?

384
00:28:14,052 --> 00:28:14,979
Nope!

385
00:28:16,165 --> 00:28:20,289
I want the lntelligence report
for this whole sector in the next two hours.

386
00:28:21,062 --> 00:28:23,483
That's nice. What's in it for me?

387
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:27,235
-A piece of the action.
-What kind of action?

388
00:28:28,806 --> 00:28:30,017
This kind of action.

389
00:28:46,279 --> 00:28:49,061
Hello, Izzy? Yeah, it's me, it's me.

390
00:28:49,383 --> 00:28:52,863
Listen, get me a quotation for gold
on the Paris market.

391
00:28:53,830 --> 00:28:55,871
Yeah, now, and hurry it up!

392
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:02,531
How much more where this came from?

393
00:29:04,231 --> 00:29:06,086
Fourteen thousand bars.

394
00:29:08,168 --> 00:29:10,111
Fourteen thousand bars?

395
00:29:11,752 --> 00:29:13,214
Fourteen thousand!

396
00:29:13,672 --> 00:29:16,902
Hey, sweetheart, have yourself a bottle
of booze, you're beautiful!

397
00:29:16,968 --> 00:29:18,659
Fourteen thousand bars!

398
00:29:19,944 --> 00:29:22,082
That's beautiful! Where is it?

399
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:23,842
In a bank.

400
00:29:24,489 --> 00:29:25,569
In a bank?

401
00:29:27,561 --> 00:29:29,667
You're getting pretty ambitious,
aren't you?

402
00:29:29,738 --> 00:29:32,104
To think you can blow a bank
and get away with it?

403
00:29:32,393 --> 00:29:33,800
It's behind enemy lines.

404
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:36,708
Behind enemy lines.

405
00:29:41,129 --> 00:29:42,951
That could be the perfect crime.

406
00:29:49,706 --> 00:29:51,647
Right. Right, I got you.

407
00:30:00,618 --> 00:30:02,527
$1.6 million.

408
00:30:04,362 --> 00:30:05,704
What else will you need?

409
00:30:05,771 --> 00:30:09,962
-You could probably use some armor.
-What are you doing up there?

410
00:30:10,027 --> 00:30:11,204
I crept in.

411
00:30:11,275 --> 00:30:12,453
Who the hell's that?

412
00:30:12,523 --> 00:30:14,149
His name's Oddball.

413
00:30:15,148 --> 00:30:17,352
I got three Shermans outside.

414
00:30:18,124 --> 00:30:19,073
What outfit?

415
00:30:20,268 --> 00:30:22,788
Right now I don't have any outfit.

416
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,747
Who's your commanding officer?

417
00:30:28,012 --> 00:30:31,208
He got decapitated by an 88
about six weeks ago.

418
00:30:31,276 --> 00:30:32,705
But don't say you're sorry.

419
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:36,130
He's been trying to get us killed
ever since we landed at Omaha Beach.

420
00:30:36,237 --> 00:30:37,219
It's terrible.

421
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:40,871
He hasn't reported him dead yet.
You see, I've been collecting his whiskey.

422
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:44,072
We see our role
as essentially a defensive image.

423
00:30:44,141 --> 00:30:46,313
While our armies are advancing so fast...

424
00:30:46,446 --> 00:30:49,162
...and everyone's knocking themselves out
to be heroes...

425
00:30:49,228 --> 00:30:52,841
...we are holding ourselves in reserve
in case the Krauts mount...

426
00:30:52,941 --> 00:30:57,514
...a counteroffensive which threatens Paris
or maybe even New York.

427
00:30:57,711 --> 00:31:00,132
Then we can move in and stop them.

428
00:31:00,686 --> 00:31:03,337
But for $1.6 million...

429
00:31:04,366 --> 00:31:07,018
...we could become heroes for three days.

430
00:31:10,766 --> 00:31:13,516
A Sherman can give you a very nice edge.

431
00:31:15,919 --> 00:31:17,293
Where are these Shermans?

432
00:31:18,287 --> 00:31:19,595
They're outside.

433
00:31:20,335 --> 00:31:22,245
Come on, I'll show them to you.

434
00:31:52,497 --> 00:31:54,090
These are my boys.

435
00:32:26,419 --> 00:32:28,142
And these are your tanks?

436
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:35,955
Don't let the dirt and the rust hang you up.

437
00:32:36,051 --> 00:32:38,669
We like to give the impression
that we're out of action.

438
00:32:38,803 --> 00:32:41,706
Badly in need of a period
of rest and reorganization.

439
00:32:42,836 --> 00:32:44,592
That way nobody bugs us.

440
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:50,991
Come on, look at the engine.

441
00:32:57,044 --> 00:33:00,689
This engine's been modified
by our mechanical genius here, Moriarty.

442
00:33:00,916 --> 00:33:01,899
Right?

443
00:33:02,101 --> 00:33:03,727
Whatever you say, babe.

444
00:33:06,805 --> 00:33:11,443
These tanks are faster than any other tanks
in Europe. Forwards or backwards.

445
00:33:12,310 --> 00:33:16,238
We like to feel that we can get out
of trouble quicker than we got into it.

446
00:33:20,598 --> 00:33:21,973
Any other secret weapons?

447
00:33:22,710 --> 00:33:23,692
Oh, yeah.

448
00:33:24,054 --> 00:33:27,185
All the tanks we come up against
are bigger and better than ours.

449
00:33:27,254 --> 00:33:29,905
So that all we can hope to do
is like scare them away.

450
00:33:29,974 --> 00:33:32,178
This gun is an ordinary 76 millimeter...

451
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:35,508
...but we added a piece of pipe onto it
and the Krauts think...

452
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,101
...maybe it's a 90 millimeter.

453
00:33:37,494 --> 00:33:39,153
We got our own ammunition.

454
00:33:39,223 --> 00:33:43,533
It's filled with paint.
When we fire it, it makes pretty pictures.

455
00:33:43,607 --> 00:33:45,548
It scares the hell out of people.

456
00:33:47,896 --> 00:33:51,824
We got a loudspeaker. When we go
into battle, we play music very loud.

457
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,483
It kind of...

458
00:33:55,031 --> 00:33:56,308
...calms us down.

459
00:34:05,720 --> 00:34:07,281
Come on inside for a minute.

460
00:34:13,369 --> 00:34:15,921
If I hear any more threats
against Maitland's life...

461
00:34:15,992 --> 00:34:19,440
...or wild talk about going to Headquarters
and killing the General...

462
00:34:19,513 --> 00:34:23,953
...or raping the nurses at the field hospital,
I'll strangle the guy with my bare hands!

463
00:34:24,025 --> 00:34:26,197
All good things come to those who wait!

464
00:34:26,969 --> 00:34:29,839
We're gonna have a lot of fun here!
Aren't we, Cowboy?

465
00:34:29,945 --> 00:34:32,761
-You can bet your boots on that, partner.
-Sergeant, partner!

466
00:34:32,826 --> 00:34:33,970
Right, Sarge.

467
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:37,200
I think I've got the crabs.

468
00:34:38,138 --> 00:34:41,237
We'll boil our laundry!
We'll set up a little shower area...

469
00:34:41,307 --> 00:34:44,209
...so we can wash our cute little bodies.
Right, Barbara?

470
00:34:44,282 --> 00:34:45,265
Shut up!

471
00:34:45,818 --> 00:34:46,833
Shave!

472
00:34:46,907 --> 00:34:49,973
A little wine, women and song.
A little chiquita for you, Petuko.

473
00:34:50,043 --> 00:34:53,971
It'll take time to get organized, but I want
that farmhouse to look like a nightclub!

474
00:34:54,042 --> 00:34:54,991
Little Joe!

475
00:34:55,067 --> 00:34:56,561
I want you to set up a bar!

476
00:34:56,635 --> 00:34:58,009
We ain't got no booze.

477
00:34:58,172 --> 00:35:01,521
"We ain't got no booze."
Well, we're gonna get some booze!

478
00:35:01,788 --> 00:35:03,642
I'm gonna go down to the Battalion...

479
00:35:03,707 --> 00:35:07,221
...see if I can lay my hands on
some dirty movies and when I come back...

480
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:11,384
...l want that farmhouse not only clean,
but completely decorated!

481
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:12,728
Do you understand that?

482
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:15,577
All right, Corporal, fall them out!
Let's get moving.

483
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,403
$16 million.

484
00:35:23,676 --> 00:35:24,854
$16 million.

485
00:35:25,628 --> 00:35:27,701
Kelly, I think I made a slight mistake.

486
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:30,905
It's not $1.6 million, it's $16 million!

487
00:35:31,197 --> 00:35:32,211
What a bundle!

488
00:35:32,989 --> 00:35:35,161
We'll need plenty of gasoline on this trip.

489
00:35:35,389 --> 00:35:37,593
Think you can get it through enemy lines?

490
00:35:37,661 --> 00:35:39,636
Just name the place, baby.

491
00:35:42,045 --> 00:35:44,216
Right here. Grid section B.

492
00:35:44,285 --> 00:35:45,813
Tonight at 21:00.

493
00:35:45,885 --> 00:35:48,985
No good, man. The boys have got
something special on tonight.

494
00:35:49,215 --> 00:35:51,931
Are you nuts?
What's more important than $16 million?

495
00:35:52,190 --> 00:35:55,573
You come around tonight, Crapgame,
and we'll show you.

496
00:35:56,094 --> 00:35:57,022
Okay.

497
00:35:57,918 --> 00:36:00,439
Tomorrow night, then.
Along this road, same hour.

498
00:36:00,639 --> 00:36:02,067
We'll be there.

499
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:06,685
-If you're late, we move out without you.
-If we're late, it's because we're dead.

500
00:36:06,752 --> 00:36:07,897
What about Big Joe?

501
00:36:07,967 --> 00:36:10,204
You handle the supplies,
I'll take care of him.

502
00:36:10,272 --> 00:36:13,086
Not only that, but I'm going along
to protect my investment.

503
00:36:13,151 --> 00:36:14,166
You don't trust me.

504
00:36:14,239 --> 00:36:17,273
A firm financial mind should be behind
an enterprise such as this.

505
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:20,824
There could be a bonus. Besides,
Switzerland's only 100 miles away.

506
00:36:21,215 --> 00:36:23,517
I don't want anybody getting lost.

507
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,066
I don't want halfthe Army in on this deal.

508
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:30,748
No friends or friends of friends.
I want to keep it a tight little unit.

509
00:36:31,136 --> 00:36:32,565
Right, Oddball?

510
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:34,910
Oh, yeah, man.

511
00:36:35,969 --> 00:36:37,114
No sweat, you know?

512
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,688
I'll pick you up in about an hour.

513
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:45,499
You can hang onto that bar of gold
as a deposit.

514
00:36:49,441 --> 00:36:51,002
Who is that guy, Crapgame?

515
00:36:51,457 --> 00:36:53,596
His name's Kelly. Used to be a lieutenant.

516
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:56,986
Pretty good one, too,
until was ordered to attack the wrong hill.

517
00:36:57,058 --> 00:36:58,847
Wiped out half a company of G.I.'s.

518
00:36:59,106 --> 00:37:01,789
Somebody had to get the blame,
and he got picked.

519
00:37:04,002 --> 00:37:06,107
Oh, man, I don't like officers.

520
00:37:11,363 --> 00:37:13,305
Neither does he, so relax.

521
00:37:18,755 --> 00:37:20,413
Get me Hogan in lntelligence.

522
00:37:25,412 --> 00:37:28,379
Do you mind if I take this bar of gold
and show it to the boys?

523
00:37:28,675 --> 00:37:32,058
No, not at all, but just remember
where you found it. Bring it back here.

524
00:37:33,796 --> 00:37:35,902
You're a good boy, Crapgame.

525
00:37:36,708 --> 00:37:38,747
Something's wrong with him.

526
00:37:39,396 --> 00:37:41,283
Hello, Hogan? It's Crapgame.

527
00:37:42,404 --> 00:37:44,859
I got you the scotch
and the nylons you wanted.

528
00:37:46,981 --> 00:37:48,322
Do I ever fail you?

529
00:37:48,772 --> 00:37:50,779
You better believe it. Never miss.

530
00:37:52,004 --> 00:37:53,084
Listen...

531
00:37:53,797 --> 00:37:56,253
...l got a little favor to ask of you.

532
00:37:58,917 --> 00:38:01,852
Will you stop crying,
I haven't even asked you yet!

533
00:38:02,598 --> 00:38:04,321
What's the matter with you?

534
00:38:23,527 --> 00:38:25,251
You wait here, Padre.

535
00:38:35,592 --> 00:38:38,275
I warned you, if you started anything,
I'd bust you out.

536
00:38:41,096 --> 00:38:42,951
If you transfer me, Joe...

537
00:38:43,304 --> 00:38:45,671
...you have to transfer every man
in this outfit.

538
00:38:45,736 --> 00:38:47,524
I told you to lay offthese guys!

539
00:38:47,591 --> 00:38:51,487
-Take it easy. He's got it all figured out.
-Who invited you, Hustler?

540
00:38:51,977 --> 00:38:52,992
He did.

541
00:38:54,793 --> 00:38:58,884
It's a snap.
$16 million just waiting to be picked up.

542
00:38:59,272 --> 00:39:01,694
Did he forget to tell you
it's behind enemy lines?

543
00:39:01,801 --> 00:39:02,728
I told them.

544
00:39:02,825 --> 00:39:03,621
Yeah?

545
00:39:03,689 --> 00:39:07,071
Did you tell them how to get through
and cover 30 miles to Clermont?

546
00:39:07,144 --> 00:39:08,770
-I told them.
-Then tell me!

547
00:39:08,841 --> 00:39:12,453
-Kelly's got it figured pretty good.
-Listen, crap! He'll get you all killed!

548
00:39:12,522 --> 00:39:14,791
We're getting killed now, pal,
for $50 a month.

549
00:39:14,858 --> 00:39:15,686
Damn right.

550
00:39:15,785 --> 00:39:17,956
What good is a bonus when you're dead?

551
00:39:18,025 --> 00:39:21,125
The risk is the same one we've been taking
since we hit the beaches.

552
00:39:21,194 --> 00:39:23,430
Only then you didn't have a choice,
now you do!

553
00:39:23,499 --> 00:39:25,919
Three days from now
we're going back into the line.

554
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:28,228
But this time we're doing it for ourselves.

555
00:39:28,938 --> 00:39:31,394
Kelly's even got us armor support.

556
00:39:32,875 --> 00:39:34,020
What armor?

557
00:39:34,187 --> 00:39:36,553
Three Shermans from the 321st.

558
00:39:36,618 --> 00:39:37,698
Who's in command?

559
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:40,192
It's a top-line outfit!
I personally recommend them!

560
00:39:40,267 --> 00:39:44,740
You butt out! The only time you come out
of the ground is when you smell a profit.

561
00:39:44,811 --> 00:39:47,331
I'm coming out now
'cause Kelly has the perfect caper!

562
00:39:47,403 --> 00:39:50,720
For you it's a vacation. Six days
out of seven you're behind the lines.

563
00:39:50,796 --> 00:39:53,960
We're at the broken end of a bottle
all the time, so you butt out!

564
00:39:57,323 --> 00:39:58,753
Who's in command?

565
00:39:59,436 --> 00:40:00,582
A guy named Oddball.

566
00:40:00,652 --> 00:40:02,026
Oddball! He's a freak!

567
00:40:02,092 --> 00:40:04,067
He's got three Shermans all ready to go.

568
00:40:04,140 --> 00:40:06,857
What guarantee is that?
He's ready to go? He's a nut.

569
00:40:07,084 --> 00:40:09,473
We're all nuts or we wouldn't be here.

570
00:40:11,277 --> 00:40:14,178
Hey, look. Let me tell you guys something.

571
00:40:14,956 --> 00:40:18,273
There's certain rules and regulations
governing the fighting of a war.

572
00:40:18,349 --> 00:40:22,278
And the first one is that
you never stick your neck out for nobody!

573
00:40:22,350 --> 00:40:24,618
Unless you're some kind of a hero type.

574
00:40:24,685 --> 00:40:27,304
And I haven't seen any hero types
around here lately.

575
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,348
Talking's not gonna do any good, Joe.

576
00:40:31,342 --> 00:40:33,230
These men are all going.

577
00:40:35,469 --> 00:40:36,582
Who will lead them?

578
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,354
If you don't, I will.

579
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:54,244
Just listen to Kelly for a minute, Joe.
He's got it all sewed, man.

580
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:57,482
The route, the timing,
the supplies, everything.

581
00:40:58,863 --> 00:40:59,812
Sure.

582
00:41:21,777 --> 00:41:23,183
What do you say, Corporal?

583
00:41:25,681 --> 00:41:27,088
I don't know, Joe.

584
00:41:27,633 --> 00:41:31,376
I figure if I got to go, it might just as well
be this trip as the next one.

585
00:41:36,977 --> 00:41:37,905
Penn?

586
00:41:38,546 --> 00:41:39,790
I'm for it.

587
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:53,548
How about it, Cowboy?

588
00:41:54,066 --> 00:41:56,816
I reckon I'm gonna have to go along
with it, Joe.

589
00:41:59,443 --> 00:42:00,687
They're all for it.

590
00:42:04,883 --> 00:42:07,305
What happens when Maitland finds out
we're not here?

591
00:42:07,828 --> 00:42:10,381
He'll figure we've been sent back
to the front lines.

592
00:42:10,612 --> 00:42:12,815
Man, he never knows
where we are anyway.

593
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:29,967
Okay, show me what you've got.

594
00:42:40,501 --> 00:42:44,178
The road's 10 yards beyond those trees.
Let me look at that map, will you?

595
00:42:44,245 --> 00:42:46,253
What ifthey've put up road blocks?

596
00:42:46,326 --> 00:42:49,076
Doesn't matter. All that matters is
Mulligan being on time.

597
00:42:49,494 --> 00:42:52,341
Mulligan is on time!
On time and on target!

598
00:42:52,534 --> 00:42:53,963
He ain't ever been that yet!

599
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:56,307
Well, there's always a first time.

600
00:42:56,438 --> 00:42:59,667
I figure the town is about
a quarter of a mile straight ahead.

601
00:42:59,733 --> 00:43:03,825
-What happens if it isn't there?
-It better be. I went through it last night.

602
00:43:04,054 --> 00:43:06,608
We've only got a few minutes left,
so let's get moving.

603
00:43:06,679 --> 00:43:09,296
Stick close to me.
I don't want to be waiting on anyone.

604
00:43:09,622 --> 00:43:10,964
We'll be there, Kelly.

605
00:43:11,287 --> 00:43:13,426
All right. Move out, Cowboy.

606
00:43:15,575 --> 00:43:17,550
That nut has got to be nuts.

607
00:43:19,894 --> 00:43:22,480
-Everything all right, Kelly?
-Everything's all right.

608
00:43:22,551 --> 00:43:25,040
You sure you got the time straight
with Mulligan?

609
00:43:25,111 --> 00:43:27,600
Yeah, I got the time straight with Mulligan.

610
00:43:27,704 --> 00:43:31,053
Whether Mulligan can tell time or not
is another question.

611
00:44:23,931 --> 00:44:24,879
Fire!

612
00:44:28,410 --> 00:44:29,359
Fire!

613
00:44:31,547 --> 00:44:32,408
Fire!

614
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,383
That crazy Mulligan's dropping them
all over the place.

615
00:46:22,913 --> 00:46:24,156
You mother!

616
00:47:09,444 --> 00:47:11,200
Shut up, you pain in the ass!

617
00:47:54,855 --> 00:47:57,572
This man is the man I have
on my mind today!

618
00:47:57,927 --> 00:48:01,407
I'll tell you who he is.
This is my opposite number!

619
00:48:01,735 --> 00:48:04,997
General Bogel, commanding
the Second German Armored Division!

620
00:48:05,063 --> 00:48:08,609
When I look at that face,
I can read that character.

621
00:48:09,448 --> 00:48:11,072
This guy's a loser.

622
00:48:11,591 --> 00:48:13,697
Here I am sitting in his headquarters.

623
00:48:14,343 --> 00:48:16,100
I'm drinking his scotch.

624
00:48:17,448 --> 00:48:20,678
I've even got one of his broads
hanging around here somewhere.

625
00:48:21,319 --> 00:48:22,978
The guy's a born loser...

626
00:48:24,552 --> 00:48:27,400
...but you, gentlemen,
have not buried him yet.

627
00:48:27,753 --> 00:48:31,647
-You call yourselves leaders of men?
-They're putting up strong resistance.

628
00:48:31,720 --> 00:48:34,437
Come on, Roach.
I flew over the battlefield this morning.

629
00:48:34,504 --> 00:48:38,596
I could march a divisional dress parade
with band music right through their lines!

630
00:48:38,665 --> 00:48:39,910
What about our flanks?

631
00:48:39,978 --> 00:48:41,406
To hell with your flanks!

632
00:48:41,481 --> 00:48:44,710
How many times I have to tell you?
Forget about your flanks, will you?

633
00:48:44,777 --> 00:48:47,745
There's still a half a Panzer Division
between here and Nancy.

634
00:48:47,818 --> 00:48:49,379
Without gas, gentlemen!

635
00:48:49,962 --> 00:48:52,165
They're getting gas.
It's coming up at night.

636
00:48:52,649 --> 00:48:53,478
How?

637
00:48:53,545 --> 00:48:54,658
By truck.

638
00:48:55,370 --> 00:48:59,265
The Air Force has got my orders
to blow up every bridge in this sector!

639
00:48:59,402 --> 00:49:02,817
They're doing it and the Germans
are rebuilding the bridges every night.

640
00:49:02,890 --> 00:49:05,607
We're supposed to be blowing them up
again in the daytime.

641
00:49:05,674 --> 00:49:07,300
Get me those aerial photographs!

642
00:49:07,371 --> 00:49:08,353
Right, sir.

643
00:49:09,866 --> 00:49:13,215
Last night someone gave orders
to redirect our mortar fire...

644
00:49:13,290 --> 00:49:15,330
...against some damn crossroads.

645
00:49:15,403 --> 00:49:19,396
Listen, Roach. I don't want any excuses
out of you, you hear me?

646
00:49:19,787 --> 00:49:24,043
I want to know why this loser of a general
is keeping me the hell out of Nancy!

647
00:49:24,427 --> 00:49:26,118
Sir, we haven't got the supplies.

648
00:49:26,572 --> 00:49:28,001
It's a matter of logistics.

649
00:49:28,076 --> 00:49:29,319
-Logistics?
-Yes, sir.

650
00:49:29,804 --> 00:49:32,487
We've got logistics coming out of our ears!

651
00:49:32,684 --> 00:49:35,848
What we need is fighting spirit!
The will to win!

652
00:49:36,365 --> 00:49:38,121
Where are those aerial photographs?

653
00:49:38,508 --> 00:49:40,450
I'm sorry. They don't seem to be here.

654
00:49:40,716 --> 00:49:41,862
They don't what?

655
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:43,722
I can't locate them, sir.

656
00:49:47,149 --> 00:49:49,603
Did you lose my aerial photographs?

657
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:02,509
It looks to me
like there ain't no bridges still up.

658
00:50:03,886 --> 00:50:05,413
What's this here?

659
00:50:07,022 --> 00:50:08,396
It's a bridge.

660
00:50:08,814 --> 00:50:10,887
It looks like some kind of railroad bridge.

661
00:50:10,958 --> 00:50:11,786
Beautiful.

662
00:50:14,702 --> 00:50:16,525
Even if we make that...

663
00:50:16,910 --> 00:50:20,652
...we've still got a river to cross later on.
Right over there.

664
00:50:20,910 --> 00:50:24,588
Let Kelly worry about that. Our problem is
getting through German lines, right?

665
00:50:25,103 --> 00:50:26,085
Right.

666
00:50:26,991 --> 00:50:27,939
How?

667
00:50:28,207 --> 00:50:30,062
It's a railroad bridge, ain't it?

668
00:50:30,159 --> 00:50:30,890
Yeah.

669
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:32,231
Then, beautiful.

670
00:50:32,303 --> 00:50:35,620
We swing down onto the railroad tracks
and right over the mother bridge.

671
00:50:37,136 --> 00:50:38,150
Sure!

672
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:40,490
Suppose the bridge ain't there?

673
00:50:46,416 --> 00:50:49,099
Don't hit me with negative waves
so early in the morning.

674
00:50:50,416 --> 00:50:53,864
Think that bridge will be there
and it will be there.

675
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:58,986
It's a mother, beautiful bridge
and it's gonna be there.

676
00:51:01,937 --> 00:51:02,864
Okay?

677
00:51:04,977 --> 00:51:05,926
Okay, Chief.

678
00:51:09,906 --> 00:51:10,953
Okay.

679
00:51:14,161 --> 00:51:15,110
Mount up.

680
00:51:17,809 --> 00:51:19,086
How many, Grace?

681
00:51:19,794 --> 00:51:20,776
Eight.

682
00:51:24,563 --> 00:51:25,839
-Penn?
-Seven.

683
00:51:32,019 --> 00:51:33,481
How many, Kelly?

684
00:51:35,027 --> 00:51:36,368
Three's fine.

685
00:51:44,371 --> 00:51:45,299
Cowboy?

686
00:51:45,395 --> 00:51:49,170
About six and I figure about eight loose.

687
00:51:50,612 --> 00:51:52,041
How about you, Willard?

688
00:51:52,180 --> 00:51:53,609
About the same.

689
00:52:00,820 --> 00:52:02,926
How many clips did you use last night?

690
00:52:03,317 --> 00:52:04,779
-About eight.
-Eight!

691
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:09,484
You're trigger-happy, Gutkowski.
Here's two more.

692
00:52:09,844 --> 00:52:11,121
Take it easy, okay?

693
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:14,540
Take it easy.

694
00:52:15,060 --> 00:52:16,719
Want some K rations, Crapgame?

695
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:18,195
No, thanks, kid.

696
00:52:18,997 --> 00:52:21,332
I could use some water.
Do you got any water?

697
00:52:23,285 --> 00:52:25,292
I'm gonna get some water, okay, kid?

698
00:52:33,590 --> 00:52:35,411
Hey, who are you writing to?

699
00:52:35,574 --> 00:52:36,850
Your mother?

700
00:52:37,270 --> 00:52:38,198
Yeah.

701
00:52:39,574 --> 00:52:41,168
Do you write often?

702
00:52:41,751 --> 00:52:42,678
Yeah.

703
00:52:44,406 --> 00:52:45,780
Where are you from?

704
00:52:46,134 --> 00:52:47,476
Indianapolis.

705
00:52:50,327 --> 00:52:51,920
Do you miss your mother?

706
00:52:51,991 --> 00:52:52,919
Yeah.

707
00:52:55,639 --> 00:52:57,549
Good talking to you, kid.

708
00:53:09,624 --> 00:53:12,308
Big Joe wants to see you
over at the command jeep.

709
00:53:23,192 --> 00:53:24,654
Something wrong?

710
00:53:25,273 --> 00:53:27,412
Yeah, just a few little things, Kelly.

711
00:53:27,641 --> 00:53:29,234
According to this map...

712
00:53:29,305 --> 00:53:32,339
...we got a river to cross before we get
into this town of yours.

713
00:53:32,441 --> 00:53:35,508
Yeah, well, there's a bridge right here.
Six miles out.

714
00:53:35,578 --> 00:53:36,690
There was a bridge.

715
00:53:36,761 --> 00:53:39,729
The Air Corps knocked every bridge
out of that river months ago.

716
00:53:39,802 --> 00:53:43,795
The Air Corps knocks them out by day
and the Germans rebuild them by night.

717
00:53:44,922 --> 00:53:49,079
All we have to do is get there tomorrow
at dawn and we've got ourselves a bridge.

718
00:53:49,146 --> 00:53:50,488
How about the German Army?

719
00:53:50,554 --> 00:53:53,074
Do you think they'd mind us
crossing their bridge?

720
00:53:55,227 --> 00:53:56,307
Probably.

721
00:53:56,443 --> 00:53:57,970
Do you know something, Kelly?

722
00:53:58,074 --> 00:54:01,391
I think you're crazy.
Better yet, I think I'm crazy!

723
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:03,833
How did I ever let you
talk these guys into this?

724
00:54:03,899 --> 00:54:07,128
Push 30 miles behind enemy lines,
take a bridge held by Germans...

725
00:54:07,195 --> 00:54:11,255
...then go into a town that we don't know
how many German soldiers are guarding!

726
00:54:12,251 --> 00:54:15,066
I figure there's between 30 and 40 troops
in that town.

727
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:17,466
All right. How did you figure that?

728
00:54:17,532 --> 00:54:21,688
Well, it's of no military importance.
It's not big enough for a garrison.

729
00:54:21,756 --> 00:54:24,985
You still didn't answer the question!
How did you figure 30 or 40 men?

730
00:54:30,653 --> 00:54:33,882
Because that's the normal amount
of support for three Tiger tanks.

731
00:54:35,164 --> 00:54:36,310
Tigers?

732
00:54:37,085 --> 00:54:38,678
Where did the Tigers come from?

733
00:54:40,317 --> 00:54:42,804
That's why we have Oddball
and his Shermans.

734
00:54:42,877 --> 00:54:44,404
Does he know about the Tigers?

735
00:54:44,477 --> 00:54:45,426
Not yet.

736
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,258
You bet your sweet ass he doesn't!

737
00:54:47,326 --> 00:54:49,399
Or he'd still be on that funny farm of his!

738
00:54:49,470 --> 00:54:53,146
He may be nuts, but he's not crazy enough
to put Shermans up against Tigers!

739
00:54:53,213 --> 00:54:57,142
Once these things get rolling, they'll blow
that whole town to pieces, including us!

740
00:54:57,854 --> 00:55:00,341
You're too smart to let that happen, Joe.

741
00:55:00,477 --> 00:55:02,845
You'll figure us a way in and out
of that town.

742
00:55:02,910 --> 00:55:04,917
I know you have a good head for tactics.

743
00:55:10,046 --> 00:55:13,429
And I intend to keep it right here
on my shoulders, Kelly.

744
00:55:13,535 --> 00:55:17,147
With these Tigers, this operation goes
above and beyond the call of duty!

745
00:55:18,912 --> 00:55:20,602
That's right, Joe.

746
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:23,963
$16 million, above and beyond.

747
00:55:24,160 --> 00:55:25,370
Hey, look, Kelly.

748
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:28,731
You're pressing their luck
and they've only got so much of it left.

749
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:30,523
It's a long, long way to Berlin.

750
00:55:30,624 --> 00:55:34,105
And they'll need every inch of that luck
before this cockamamie war is over!

751
00:55:36,032 --> 00:55:37,015
Cover!

752
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,672
Come on, on the double!
Let's get the equipment out of the trucks!

753
00:56:09,538 --> 00:56:11,710
On the double, move it out! Here.

754
00:56:15,426 --> 00:56:16,255
Cover!

755
00:56:16,578 --> 00:56:17,506
Take cover!

756
00:56:39,556 --> 00:56:41,116
That idiot's one of ours!

757
00:56:41,187 --> 00:56:42,365
Holy crap!

758
00:56:56,932 --> 00:56:58,045
Our hero.

759
00:57:06,438 --> 00:57:08,674
This is crazy, isn't it, Willard?

760
00:57:08,741 --> 00:57:11,741
-Anybody get the plane's number?
-Why? Who will you complain to?

761
00:57:11,813 --> 00:57:13,374
Move it out, move it out.

762
00:57:13,990 --> 00:57:16,771
-Still think we can make it, wise guy?
-We can still try.

763
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:19,074
Well, Oddball better show up, Kelly.

764
00:57:19,270 --> 00:57:21,637
That's all I got to say, he'd better show up.

765
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:24,928
Move it out!

766
00:57:28,870 --> 00:57:30,431
-How is it?
-Shot!

767
00:57:31,174 --> 00:57:34,623
-There's a hole right through the cylinder.
-How about the radio equipment?

768
00:57:35,271 --> 00:57:37,343
The pack radio is okay,
but the rest has had it.

769
00:57:37,415 --> 00:57:39,041
Pick it up and take it with you.

770
00:57:39,111 --> 00:57:40,540
I got your equipment, Joe.

771
00:57:40,679 --> 00:57:41,792
Bring it.

772
00:57:43,272 --> 00:57:45,889
I told you! We should've never gone in
on this deal.

773
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,225
Well, you never told me!

774
00:57:48,487 --> 00:57:49,665
Yes, I did.

775
00:57:51,527 --> 00:57:54,397
Is this why we pay taxes?
To be bombed by our own Air Force?

776
00:57:54,472 --> 00:57:55,616
Damn right!

777
00:57:58,152 --> 00:57:59,396
What do we do now?

778
00:57:59,464 --> 00:58:03,207
Pick up our equipment and get out of here
before a German patrol comes along.

779
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:05,895
That's great.

780
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:08,807
Let's move the stuff up to the wall,
on the double!

781
00:58:09,129 --> 00:58:10,820
-Everybody all right?
-I think so.

782
00:58:10,889 --> 00:58:12,099
What happened, Joe?

783
00:58:12,745 --> 00:58:15,297
-Where the hell have you been?
-I had to go.

784
00:58:15,368 --> 00:58:16,645
We all have to go!

785
00:58:16,777 --> 00:58:20,640
Come on! We've got 20 miles to walk
and 9 hours to walk it in, so move it out!

786
00:58:20,873 --> 00:58:21,734
Big Joe?

787
00:58:21,801 --> 00:58:25,827
Must I carry all this equipment, the satchel
and the .30 caliber machine gun?

788
00:58:26,730 --> 00:58:28,519
Give the .30 caliber to the Hustler.

789
00:58:28,586 --> 00:58:30,375
He wants to be a hero.

790
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,937
Here you are, old buddy.

791
00:58:37,482 --> 00:58:39,904
Thanks! Get yourself a bucket of grits!

792
00:58:45,738 --> 00:58:47,877
All right, Corporal, let's go.
Move them out!

793
00:58:47,947 --> 00:58:49,835
Move it out, Penn!

794
00:58:49,899 --> 00:58:51,241
It's a long way.

795
00:58:52,203 --> 00:58:53,381
Move it out!

796
00:58:53,452 --> 00:58:54,793
Kelly, get on the point.

797
00:58:56,683 --> 00:58:58,658
Why did you get me elected to carry this?

798
00:58:58,731 --> 00:59:01,579
You wanted in on this?
Then learn to carry your own load.

799
00:59:01,644 --> 00:59:03,368
Come on, move it out!

800
00:59:03,787 --> 00:59:05,216
Yeah, up yours!

801
00:59:39,182 --> 00:59:42,859
Take it easy, take it easy. Take it easy.
Okay, hold it. Hold it!

802
00:59:47,438 --> 00:59:50,188
It looks like we've got
a military installation up ahead.

803
00:59:50,255 --> 00:59:53,735
So, make it the same deal as before.
We'll go into a triangular formation.

804
00:59:53,806 --> 00:59:56,970
I'll go down the slot.
Moe, you go down the right flank.

805
00:59:57,038 --> 00:59:58,981
Whiskey, down the left. Keep it tight.

806
00:59:59,055 --> 01:00:02,632
Don't break it up until I give you the word.
Okay, button up and let's go.

807
01:00:40,114 --> 01:00:40,877
Fire!

808
01:01:04,306 --> 01:01:05,070
Fire!

809
01:01:14,259 --> 01:01:15,022
Hit it!

810
01:01:23,411 --> 01:01:25,713
All right, lay four rounds in there heavy!

811
01:01:28,756 --> 01:01:30,217
Come on, move it! Move it!

812
01:01:51,509 --> 01:01:52,338
Hit it!

813
01:01:55,318 --> 01:01:56,081
Fire!

814
01:01:58,997 --> 01:01:59,925
Fire!

815
01:02:06,070 --> 01:02:07,412
Bring it around, Howard!

816
01:02:19,702 --> 01:02:20,466
Hit it!

817
01:03:28,602 --> 01:03:30,707
-All right, let's go, Petuko.
-Right, Joe.

818
01:03:30,778 --> 01:03:32,567
Move them out, Corporal.

819
01:03:32,667 --> 01:03:33,944
Let's go, Babra.

820
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:36,345
Wake up, Gutkowski. Let's go.

821
01:03:39,195 --> 01:03:40,886
All right, Hustler, let's go.

822
01:03:43,132 --> 01:03:46,928
This was your idea. How come
we don't go back to our own lines?

823
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:49,971
It's further back
than it is to where we're going.

824
01:03:50,043 --> 01:03:52,793
I know what. Let's surrender, I'm hungry.

825
01:03:54,588 --> 01:03:56,343
All right! I buy it.

826
01:03:56,443 --> 01:03:58,680
I'll make you $50
if you carry the machine gun.

827
01:03:58,780 --> 01:03:59,860
You got it on you?

828
01:03:59,996 --> 01:04:02,168
-Don't you trust me?
-No, I don't.

829
01:04:02,237 --> 01:04:05,139
What do you think I am, a vault?
You think I carry money on me?

830
01:04:05,213 --> 01:04:07,482
I ask you a favor
and you don't want to help me?

831
01:04:07,549 --> 01:04:10,746
All I asked you to do is carry
the machine gun. I'll give you $100.

832
01:04:10,813 --> 01:04:12,755
-Do you have it?
-I don't have it on me!

833
01:04:12,829 --> 01:04:14,651
Shut up!

834
01:04:15,325 --> 01:04:17,016
You guys keep quiet.

835
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,282
It's still up.

836
01:04:42,312 --> 01:04:43,654
No, it ain't.

837
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:51,109
You see what sending out
them negative waves did, Moriarty?

838
01:04:51,176 --> 01:04:52,965
That ain't my fault, Oddball.

839
01:04:53,128 --> 01:04:56,674
I've had nothing but good thoughts
about that damn bridge ever since we left!

840
01:04:56,745 --> 01:04:58,272
What happens now?

841
01:04:59,848 --> 01:05:02,631
It looks like we're gonna find ourselves
another bridge.

842
01:05:03,049 --> 01:05:05,285
Where are we gonna come up
with another bridge?

843
01:05:05,448 --> 01:05:09,442
There you go, more negative waves!
Have a little faith, baby.

844
01:05:10,025 --> 01:05:11,717
Have a little faith.

845
01:05:14,153 --> 01:05:16,608
Now go on, get down into your hole.

846
01:05:17,098 --> 01:05:18,210
Move out!

847
01:05:33,706 --> 01:05:36,903
42nd Engineers. Bridging Unit.
Corporal Roamer speaking.

848
01:05:39,403 --> 01:05:40,296
Hey, Sarge?

849
01:05:41,739 --> 01:05:42,916
It's Oddball!

850
01:05:53,195 --> 01:05:56,294
Don't try to be funny, Oddball!
What do you want?

851
01:05:57,131 --> 01:06:01,540
I'm calling you from a caf
about 10 miles south of Mesurier.

852
01:06:01,613 --> 01:06:03,499
I wondered if you could do me a favor?

853
01:06:03,755 --> 01:06:04,966
Mesurier?

854
01:06:05,452 --> 01:06:09,446
I got a map here someplace that says
we haven't even captured that place yet!

855
01:06:09,612 --> 01:06:12,710
Yeah, so I heard.
Everybody seems very friendly.

856
01:06:12,908 --> 01:06:15,876
Look, baby, I'm kind of hung up.
I need about 60 feet of bridge.

857
01:06:16,236 --> 01:06:20,099
How am I supposed to get 60 feet of bridge
10 miles behind the German lines?

858
01:06:20,301 --> 01:06:24,163
I'm about to put you onto something good
and you are giving me your problems.

859
01:06:24,269 --> 01:06:28,230
This sector's so screwed up, nobody knows
where the German lines or our lines are.

860
01:06:28,302 --> 01:06:29,829
I got through with no problem.

861
01:06:29,902 --> 01:06:33,698
I've got a bank back here with $16 million
waiting to be picked up. Are you in?

862
01:06:34,029 --> 01:06:37,128
They haven't got you back
in the nut ward again, have they?

863
01:06:37,198 --> 01:06:38,725
Bellamy! For crying out loud!

864
01:06:38,798 --> 01:06:41,449
That is the lousiest, stinking,
most awful, stupid joke!

865
01:06:41,518 --> 01:06:44,136
You're always pulling
that stinking, awful, stupid joke!

866
01:06:44,206 --> 01:06:47,622
You don't want in this thing, don't get in!
I cut you out of everything!

867
01:06:47,695 --> 01:06:51,404
I don't need you. 60 feet of bridge,
I can pick up almost anywhere! Shmuck!

868
01:06:51,470 --> 01:06:52,899
All right, all right!

869
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:57,066
Look, with three tanks, it's easy.
With a 60-foot bridge it's something else!

870
01:06:57,135 --> 01:07:00,932
I need support units, Oddball.
I need at least 100 guys!

871
01:07:01,006 --> 01:07:03,756
Where do I find 100 men, just like that?

872
01:07:30,961 --> 01:07:32,685
Eighteen miles to....

873
01:07:33,969 --> 01:07:34,984
Jerks!

874
01:08:04,691 --> 01:08:05,639
Shut up!

875
01:08:08,019 --> 01:08:10,026
We've walked into a minefield.

876
01:08:12,979 --> 01:08:14,354
All right, who bought it?

877
01:08:14,419 --> 01:08:15,368
It's Grace!

878
01:08:19,347 --> 01:08:21,933
There's a road right up here
at the edge of the field.

879
01:08:22,804 --> 01:08:24,976
Mark that spot and head for the road.

880
01:08:25,556 --> 01:08:26,833
Everybody!

881
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:28,754
Take out your bayonets...

882
01:08:29,556 --> 01:08:31,018
...and move towards Kelly!

883
01:08:31,348 --> 01:08:32,296
Corporal!

884
01:08:32,564 --> 01:08:34,452
Move the men down slowly!

885
01:08:34,901 --> 01:08:36,242
Mitchell?

886
01:08:36,469 --> 01:08:39,185
You pick up Grace's B.A.R.
and head this way!

887
01:08:39,252 --> 01:08:41,554
Jonesy, for Christ's sake stand still!

888
01:08:43,061 --> 01:08:44,076
Corporal?

889
01:08:44,469 --> 01:08:48,211
Go see if Grace is still alive.
Jonesy, will you get the hell down?

890
01:09:47,608 --> 01:09:48,950
Looks all right up here.

891
01:09:50,713 --> 01:09:53,615
All right, you guys, keep it moving!
Stay careful.

892
01:09:59,993 --> 01:10:01,138
Hey, I found one!

893
01:10:04,090 --> 01:10:05,137
What kind is it?

894
01:10:06,265 --> 01:10:09,299
The kind that blows up!
How the hell do I know what kind it is?

895
01:10:09,402 --> 01:10:11,541
Mark the spot and keep moving, Hustler.

896
01:10:12,154 --> 01:10:13,496
I'll mark it!

897
01:10:29,147 --> 01:10:32,562
Gutkowski, get down there on that bend
and keep an eye out.

898
01:10:51,965 --> 01:10:53,787
Okay, bring the B.A.R.

899
01:11:32,287 --> 01:11:35,320
Penn, get that .30 caliber set up
the other side of the wall.

900
01:11:37,150 --> 01:11:40,217
I could've been in the States
playing ping-pong, volleyball...

901
01:11:40,543 --> 01:11:42,103
...plenty of broads.

902
01:11:43,614 --> 01:11:45,469
Who the hell needs all this?

903
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:48,284
I'm gonna get my knife
and get the hell out of here.

904
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,715
Lousy equipment.

905
01:11:51,168 --> 01:11:52,923
Now I got to lift up this cannon.

906
01:11:53,503 --> 01:11:56,439
Carry it all the way
to the front line someplace.

907
01:11:56,703 --> 01:11:59,606
The damn thing is heavier
than Kelsey's burgers.

908
01:12:00,608 --> 01:12:03,510
Sure, I'll get a rupture yet
with this damn thing.

909
01:12:13,536 --> 01:12:14,649
Move it now!

910
01:12:15,585 --> 01:12:17,374
On the double, across the road.

911
01:12:17,985 --> 01:12:19,895
Stay on Kelly's path all the way!

912
01:12:20,034 --> 01:12:20,982
On the double!

913
01:12:22,561 --> 01:12:25,529
Come on, Hustler. Move it, move it.
It's all safe for you, now.

914
01:12:25,601 --> 01:12:28,471
I hope you have to take the gas pipe!
You creep!

915
01:12:28,545 --> 01:12:30,455
-All the way, you jerk!
-Go to hell!

916
01:12:30,978 --> 01:12:32,384
Let's go, Cowboy! Move it!

917
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:34,552
Come on, Willard. Let's mount up, boy.

918
01:12:34,626 --> 01:12:36,481
Anything we can do for you, Corporal?

919
01:12:36,706 --> 01:12:38,201
No, thanks. We're all right.

920
01:12:38,434 --> 01:12:40,823
-Come on, Willard. Hit it, boy.
-I'm ready.

921
01:12:45,730 --> 01:12:47,618
How did we get talked into this mess?

922
01:12:47,682 --> 01:12:49,854
It took 10 seconds to talk you into this.

923
01:12:50,115 --> 01:12:53,944
But we were supposed to ride, not walk.
Nobody said anything about mines...

924
01:12:54,019 --> 01:12:56,539
...or shlepping this machine gun
all over the country!

925
01:12:56,611 --> 01:13:00,060
Quit your bitching and just remember
what's at the end of the line.

926
01:13:01,347 --> 01:13:02,329
Kelly!

927
01:13:08,804 --> 01:13:10,364
There's a patrol coming in.

928
01:13:10,468 --> 01:13:12,671
All right! Spread them out
across the road!

929
01:13:12,740 --> 01:13:14,912
Move it! Your crabs will leave you now!

930
01:13:15,588 --> 01:13:18,076
Get that gun set up
on the other side of the wall.

931
01:13:21,956 --> 01:13:22,905
Move!

932
01:13:24,036 --> 01:13:25,695
Move it, Petuko, move it!

933
01:13:25,828 --> 01:13:28,512
-Don't forget about the broads!
-You horny bastard!

934
01:13:40,965 --> 01:13:42,624
Get the hell out of there!

935
01:13:44,677 --> 01:13:47,492
You'll never make it!
We'll cover you from the road.

936
01:13:47,558 --> 01:13:50,557
-Don't move unless they spot you.
-Right! Go on.

937
01:13:53,958 --> 01:13:55,552
Set up the B.A.R. there.

938
01:14:08,071 --> 01:14:10,918
All right, stay down and load up.
Stay down, load up!

939
01:14:15,432 --> 01:14:16,479
Stay down.

940
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,375
Stay down, hold your fire.

941
01:14:24,936 --> 01:14:26,049
Grenades.

942
01:14:41,128 --> 01:14:44,063
-Let's get out of here. Let's go back.
-Take it easy.

943
01:14:44,553 --> 01:14:47,139
It's too late, now.
We're better off here, anyway.

944
01:14:47,433 --> 01:14:49,058
Get your head down.

945
01:15:19,722 --> 01:15:21,097
Nice and easy.

946
01:15:48,013 --> 01:15:49,190
Stay down.

947
01:16:21,582 --> 01:16:22,662
All right.

948
01:16:23,503 --> 01:16:24,299
Get ready.

949
01:16:30,255 --> 01:16:31,204
Hold it.

950
01:16:32,815 --> 01:16:33,447
Fire!

951
01:17:18,737 --> 01:17:19,850
Let's go!

952
01:17:40,531 --> 01:17:41,480
Jam!

953
01:17:41,779 --> 01:17:42,892
Clear it!

954
01:19:15,416 --> 01:19:16,910
Let's move it out.

955
01:19:20,696 --> 01:19:23,184
All right, you heard me!
I said, move it out!

956
01:19:27,481 --> 01:19:29,521
Maybe they're only wounded.

957
01:19:29,913 --> 01:19:32,018
They're dead, so forget it. Let's move.

958
01:20:30,556 --> 01:20:33,240
There's a whole column
of Shermans coming over the hill!

959
01:20:35,228 --> 01:20:37,946
Take it easy. Go get your packs!
Pick up your equipment!

960
01:20:48,637 --> 01:20:50,546
Go on down and load up.

961
01:20:52,702 --> 01:20:53,650
Ready!

962
01:20:56,190 --> 01:20:57,118
Fire!

963
01:21:05,727 --> 01:21:08,181
I thought you said three Shermans.

964
01:21:08,350 --> 01:21:10,619
Those nuts have brought halfthe Army
with them!

965
01:21:18,398 --> 01:21:21,977
Okay, keep a move on.
Let's keep on coming.

966
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:24,702
Come on. Okay, move.

967
01:21:34,912 --> 01:21:36,800
Are you ready for this?

968
01:21:37,057 --> 01:21:38,965
Split how many ways, stupid?

969
01:21:40,640 --> 01:21:41,655
Come on, Willard!

970
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,998
What is this? What is this, a ball game?
Who are these guys?

971
01:21:52,129 --> 01:21:53,656
They're my friends, Crapgame.

972
01:21:53,761 --> 01:21:55,387
Friends? Where'd you find them?

973
01:21:56,066 --> 01:21:57,047
Here and there.

974
01:21:57,696 --> 01:21:59,639
There's a bunch of refugees over there!

975
01:21:59,713 --> 01:22:01,022
It's a band.

976
01:22:01,345 --> 01:22:03,385
A band? What do we need a band for?

977
01:22:04,194 --> 01:22:07,292
Have a little faith, Crapgame.
They're beautiful people.

978
01:22:08,673 --> 01:22:12,154
Kid, pull yourselftogether.
We ain't in the middle of Central Park!

979
01:22:12,226 --> 01:22:13,339
Oddball!

980
01:22:13,795 --> 01:22:17,689
How do you figure on moving through
enemy terrain with a column a mile long?

981
01:22:17,794 --> 01:22:20,664
Easy. We can fight. We got an army.

982
01:22:20,963 --> 01:22:23,930
Those freaks! That ain't an army,
it's a circus!

983
01:22:26,050 --> 01:22:27,806
Take it easy, Big Joe.

984
01:22:28,003 --> 01:22:30,589
Some of these people
have got sensitive feelings.

985
01:22:31,171 --> 01:22:32,513
Who's the guy in charge?

986
01:22:32,900 --> 01:22:33,827
I am.

987
01:22:33,987 --> 01:22:35,677
What's the deal with the gold?

988
01:22:36,098 --> 01:22:39,230
Any man who gets to the town
and hits the bank, gets an equal share.

989
01:22:39,299 --> 01:22:41,885
But don't try to cross us.
There's gonna be trouble.

990
01:22:41,955 --> 01:22:43,516
Who's gonna make it, boy?

991
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:44,351
I am!

992
01:22:44,420 --> 01:22:45,630
Get out and start it!

993
01:22:45,699 --> 01:22:47,106
Take it easy, big mouth.

994
01:22:47,459 --> 01:22:49,947
You get out of here.
Everybody else up on the tanks.

995
01:22:50,020 --> 01:22:51,002
Let's move out!

996
01:22:51,076 --> 01:22:52,320
Don't double-cross us!

997
01:22:52,388 --> 01:22:55,071
-Any double-crossing will be your fat lip!
-Get moving.

998
01:22:55,139 --> 01:22:56,088
Shut up!

999
01:22:56,260 --> 01:22:58,333
Everybody up on that tank. Let's go!

1000
01:23:04,517 --> 01:23:06,688
We're not going
with those cowboys, are we?

1001
01:23:06,757 --> 01:23:10,620
We've got $16 million up for grabs
and we won't let those clods beat us to it.

1002
01:23:10,694 --> 01:23:12,003
Now, let's get moving.

1003
01:23:34,918 --> 01:23:36,511
I say, Booker?

1004
01:23:38,983 --> 01:23:40,096
Yes, sir?

1005
01:23:40,262 --> 01:23:42,597
The old man was just on the line!

1006
01:23:42,824 --> 01:23:45,856
He says I've broken through
a long and entire front!

1007
01:23:45,926 --> 01:23:47,171
Why wasn't I told?

1008
01:23:47,559 --> 01:23:48,606
I don't know, sir.

1009
01:23:49,031 --> 01:23:51,366
You're the Communications Officer!

1010
01:23:51,464 --> 01:23:53,503
You're supposed to be able
to communicate!

1011
01:23:53,767 --> 01:23:56,353
Who's broken through
and how far have they gone?

1012
01:23:56,424 --> 01:23:57,918
Well, no one has, sir.

1013
01:23:57,992 --> 01:24:00,643
It seems someone's found a hole
in the right flank.

1014
01:24:00,712 --> 01:24:04,192
They're trying to push elements
of the 321st and the 35th into it.

1015
01:24:04,392 --> 01:24:07,458
"Seems," Booker?
"Elements of the 321st and 35th"?

1016
01:24:07,945 --> 01:24:10,628
Who's pushing them in there,
and where the hell are they?

1017
01:24:11,081 --> 01:24:12,194
I don't know, sir.

1018
01:24:12,650 --> 01:24:14,788
I'm coming down there, Booker!

1019
01:24:14,857 --> 01:24:18,240
What's the use of a communications officer
who can't communicate?

1020
01:24:18,825 --> 01:24:21,443
Communication?
He's more like a damn military censor!

1021
01:24:21,834 --> 01:24:23,906
I'm back from Paris. I got everything.

1022
01:24:23,977 --> 01:24:26,727
All I want is to know
whether we have broken through or not!

1023
01:24:26,794 --> 01:24:29,794
It's hard to say for certain, sir.
Nothing's been confirmed yet.

1024
01:24:30,185 --> 01:24:34,113
We've intercepted some signals
that suggest some action at a bridge...

1025
01:24:34,249 --> 01:24:35,559
...near Clermont.

1026
01:24:35,753 --> 01:24:37,379
Is that Clermont, Booker?

1027
01:24:37,706 --> 01:24:38,470
Yes, sir.

1028
01:24:38,538 --> 01:24:40,480
Then why in the hell didn't you say so?

1029
01:24:40,906 --> 01:24:44,451
That's 30 miles beyond their lines!
You got them on the radio?

1030
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:45,544
Yes, sir.

1031
01:24:45,770 --> 01:24:48,640
It's hard to pick them up clearly
at this time in the morning.

1032
01:24:48,715 --> 01:24:50,406
It has to do with the ionosphere.

1033
01:24:50,475 --> 01:24:53,409
Get the ionosphere the hell offthe air
and get them on!

1034
01:24:53,482 --> 01:24:55,872
Get out of there, Soldier.
Do something else.

1035
01:24:55,979 --> 01:24:58,500
-What's the frequency?
-300 kc, sir.

1036
01:24:58,572 --> 01:25:02,597
You won't find them easy to follow.
They're using some kind of code.

1037
01:25:03,339 --> 01:25:04,135
What code?

1038
01:25:04,203 --> 01:25:06,440
Words like "bank heist,
Crapgame, Big Joe...

1039
01:25:06,508 --> 01:25:07,937
"...Little Joe, Oddball--"

1040
01:25:08,268 --> 01:25:10,690
Can anybody get rid of
that machine gun for me.

1041
01:25:10,764 --> 01:25:13,316
-Yes, sir, there! That's it, that's them!
-Where?

1042
01:25:13,387 --> 01:25:15,755
There! Right on 300, sir. Right there.

1043
01:25:17,004 --> 01:25:20,267
There they are, sir. Those are the signals
we've been picking up.

1044
01:25:20,333 --> 01:25:23,529
Will you shut up and let me try and listen
to what they're saying?

1045
01:25:25,453 --> 01:25:27,079
Oddball, this Kelly.

1046
01:25:27,149 --> 01:25:30,051
Kelly, what the hell's going on
out there, man?

1047
01:25:30,125 --> 01:25:33,474
It's cleared ofinfantry. What doyou hear
from those other two tanks?

1048
01:25:33,965 --> 01:25:38,308
No chance, man. They've both had it.
One's in the river, the other's burning.

1049
01:25:39,150 --> 01:25:41,037
Yeah, I can see them from here. Over.

1050
01:25:42,701 --> 01:25:43,748
Where's Big Joe?

1051
01:25:44,046 --> 01:25:47,112
On the other side. Get offthe line,
I'll get in touch with him.

1052
01:25:47,566 --> 01:25:48,515
Fire!

1053
01:25:49,199 --> 01:25:50,343
Okay. Over and out.

1054
01:25:51,150 --> 01:25:54,052
Kelly to Big Joe. Kelly to Big Joe. Over.

1055
01:25:54,415 --> 01:25:56,782
Kelly, it's Crapgame.
What's happening over there?

1056
01:25:57,358 --> 01:26:00,653
They're dropping artillery
all over the place! That's what.

1057
01:26:00,750 --> 01:26:01,928
Where's Big Joe?

1058
01:26:02,383 --> 01:26:04,750
He's not here. He's pinned down
under the bridge.

1059
01:26:05,295 --> 01:26:07,084
Well, get him for me! Over.

1060
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,892
Damn! Are we losing them?
We just had them good a minute ago!

1061
01:26:10,959 --> 01:26:12,650
I'm doing it, Booker!

1062
01:26:13,551 --> 01:26:14,534
Quiet!

1063
01:26:14,607 --> 01:26:16,299
What should I do with this?

1064
01:26:16,368 --> 01:26:19,019
Get the hell out of here!
We've got the game on!

1065
01:26:30,128 --> 01:26:31,437
Kelly, this Big Joe.

1066
01:26:31,952 --> 01:26:34,604
It's pretty clear over here,
except for the artillery.

1067
01:26:34,673 --> 01:26:38,285
The bridge is too far gone for vehicles.
You can bring the men over by foot.

1068
01:26:38,737 --> 01:26:40,460
Get them moving.

1069
01:26:40,752 --> 01:26:43,600
Okay, I'll send them over
in twos and threes. Out.

1070
01:26:43,953 --> 01:26:47,434
Petuko, Willard! Drop your packs
and take the equipment across the bridge.

1071
01:26:49,777 --> 01:26:51,981
Kelly, what did Big Joe say?

1072
01:26:53,105 --> 01:26:54,633
Says he's sending them across.

1073
01:26:54,994 --> 01:26:57,864
Tell him to hurry up.
It's getting hotter than hell in here!

1074
01:27:01,042 --> 01:27:02,952
-What's going on?
-We're crossing over.

1075
01:27:03,058 --> 01:27:06,604
-You're not crossing over without us!
-Then grab your trucks and come on up.

1076
01:27:06,674 --> 01:27:08,364
The bridge is too badly damaged.

1077
01:27:08,434 --> 01:27:09,809
You want to come, fix it.

1078
01:27:09,938 --> 01:27:12,110
Half my equipment's jammed up
in the rear!

1079
01:27:12,179 --> 01:27:13,488
Un-jam them!

1080
01:27:13,554 --> 01:27:16,686
We've lost two tanks already!
I won't stick around to lose a third!

1081
01:27:16,755 --> 01:27:18,249
Listen, we made a deal!

1082
01:27:18,323 --> 01:27:20,843
Not with me, you didn't.
Here! You talk to Kelly.

1083
01:27:20,915 --> 01:27:22,344
Cowboy, stay with the truck.

1084
01:27:22,419 --> 01:27:23,248
Ready?

1085
01:27:23,955 --> 01:27:25,777
This is Bellamy for Kelly!

1086
01:27:26,835 --> 01:27:29,769
We can't use the bridge.
We can't ford the river.

1087
01:27:29,843 --> 01:27:30,858
So what do we do?

1088
01:27:30,931 --> 01:27:32,208
Go team go. Go!

1089
01:27:32,308 --> 01:27:34,380
You've got bridging equipment. Over.

1090
01:27:34,452 --> 01:27:38,314
That's a five-hour operation.
Can you hold on for five hours? Over.

1091
01:27:38,419 --> 01:27:40,624
No, no! Move! On, on! Move!

1092
01:27:40,916 --> 01:27:44,146
We're not gonna hold on for five minutes.
You can catch up.

1093
01:27:44,405 --> 01:27:47,917
Kelly, we're all in this together.
You can't go it alone! Over!

1094
01:27:48,180 --> 01:27:52,109
We're not gonna wait five hours, either.
If you can't keep up, that's your problem.

1095
01:27:52,213 --> 01:27:54,831
We're pulling out
and we're pushing forward! Over!

1096
01:27:54,933 --> 01:27:56,362
Attack! Attack! Attack!

1097
01:27:56,534 --> 01:27:59,981
That's fighting spirit I was talking about!
Listen to that guy!

1098
01:28:00,053 --> 01:28:01,963
If he was a major, he's a colonel now!

1099
01:28:02,102 --> 01:28:06,543
This the Grave Diggers Registration Unit.
We got a stake in this advance, too.

1100
01:28:06,614 --> 01:28:09,231
Did you ever hear enthusiasm like that
in all your life?

1101
01:28:09,302 --> 01:28:13,230
They've even got the damn Grave Diggers!
What the hell am I doing here?

1102
01:28:13,302 --> 01:28:15,954
Bonsor! Get me my uniform!

1103
01:28:16,502 --> 01:28:18,291
-Get on!
-I wonder where Cowboy is?

1104
01:28:18,390 --> 01:28:19,699
Give me that gun!

1105
01:28:20,183 --> 01:28:21,492
Pick up that radio!

1106
01:28:22,039 --> 01:28:23,216
Faster, faster!

1107
01:28:23,927 --> 01:28:26,033
Hurry up you guys!
We haven't got much time!

1108
01:28:26,104 --> 01:28:26,931
Get up!

1109
01:28:26,999 --> 01:28:28,787
Crapgame, do you like the Army?

1110
01:28:29,303 --> 01:28:31,026
Let's go! Let's get out of here!

1111
01:28:32,568 --> 01:28:34,161
All right, let's move them out!

1112
01:28:36,471 --> 01:28:39,854
-This is it, Penn. We're on our way, baby.
-Cowboy, come on! Hurry up!

1113
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:41,068
Here we go!

1114
01:28:42,327 --> 01:28:45,590
-Come on, Cowboy! This train's leaving.
-Give me your hand.

1115
01:28:45,879 --> 01:28:47,789
Somebody grab that radio.

1116
01:28:48,664 --> 01:28:50,835
There you go! Come on, up, up!

1117
01:28:51,960 --> 01:28:53,390
That a boy, come on!

1118
01:28:54,777 --> 01:28:55,758
That's it.

1119
01:29:01,241 --> 01:29:04,624
Booker, tell General Castle
that I want every man in this Army...

1120
01:29:04,698 --> 01:29:06,290
...on the road within the hour.

1121
01:29:06,809 --> 01:29:08,238
I'm pushing on to the Rhine.

1122
01:29:08,505 --> 01:29:11,091
But, sir, Clermont's 30 miles
behind enemy lines.

1123
01:29:11,353 --> 01:29:12,466
That you, Maitland?

1124
01:29:13,561 --> 01:29:14,902
Just back from Paris, sir.

1125
01:29:15,065 --> 01:29:16,953
Get my vehicle and driver around here.

1126
01:29:17,017 --> 01:29:18,905
You get my box of medals.

1127
01:29:19,002 --> 01:29:22,036
I'll decorate every man in this penetration,
whoever they are.

1128
01:29:22,138 --> 01:29:24,473
They've saved the reputation
of this entire Army.

1129
01:29:24,538 --> 01:29:27,920
You're supposed to fight this battle
and you don't even know where it is!

1130
01:29:27,994 --> 01:29:31,344
I'll tell you where it is! It's 30 miles
beyond where you thought it was!

1131
01:29:32,410 --> 01:29:35,159
Come on, let's get this Army of mine
back in the war!

1132
01:29:35,227 --> 01:29:36,437
Will you send that?

1133
01:30:27,006 --> 01:30:29,308
Shouldn't you wait for the Army
to get ahead of you?

1134
01:30:29,374 --> 01:30:30,901
History waits for no man.

1135
01:30:30,974 --> 01:30:33,210
I have an appointment with destiny
in Clermont.

1136
01:30:33,278 --> 01:30:34,739
Take this weapon, Maitland.

1137
01:30:34,813 --> 01:30:36,723
All right, boy! Make this thing fly.

1138
01:30:36,862 --> 01:30:39,034
-General, your medals.
-Good luck, sir.

1139
01:31:21,600 --> 01:31:23,487
We're in the bell tower of the church.

1140
01:31:23,905 --> 01:31:26,775
You can see the whole town
from up here almost.

1141
01:31:26,848 --> 01:31:29,238
There's not much happening.
They're still asleep.

1142
01:31:29,761 --> 01:31:33,077
There's three Tigers in the square
right down below us.

1143
01:31:33,857 --> 01:31:36,760
Do you see anything
that looks like it might be a bank?

1144
01:31:36,834 --> 01:31:39,584
It's got to be this building right here
to the right ofus.

1145
01:31:39,650 --> 01:31:41,372
Canyou see it from where you are?

1146
01:31:41,441 --> 01:31:43,995
They've got two machine guns
and guards on the roof.

1147
01:31:45,762 --> 01:31:49,756
I don't think I can see much
of the center of town from up here.

1148
01:31:50,882 --> 01:31:54,744
No, just a lot of roof tops
and bombed out buildings.

1149
01:31:58,019 --> 01:32:01,280
Beside the tanks, can you see anything
that might house support units?

1150
01:32:01,986 --> 01:32:05,532
There's a big brown building
right behind the bank with a jeep...

1151
01:32:05,891 --> 01:32:08,412
...and two guards and about three trucks.

1152
01:32:09,251 --> 01:32:10,330
Hold it!

1153
01:32:15,075 --> 01:32:19,419
There's a German officer walking around
the bank towards the brown building.

1154
01:32:19,780 --> 01:32:20,892
What doyou think?

1155
01:32:20,964 --> 01:32:23,485
We shouldn't have trouble
unless it's with the Tigers.

1156
01:32:23,556 --> 01:32:26,174
We can take the machine gunners
on the rooffrom here...

1157
01:32:26,244 --> 01:32:28,284
...ifyou can keep them busy for a while.

1158
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:30,974
Or maybe we can go down
and get a closer look.

1159
01:32:31,044 --> 01:32:32,735
No, stay there. Keep an eye out.

1160
01:32:32,804 --> 01:32:35,521
See if you can find out
where those troops are housed.

1161
01:32:37,285 --> 01:32:38,977
Well, what do you think, Oddball?

1162
01:32:39,046 --> 01:32:43,006
It's a wasted trip. Nobody said anything
about locking horns with Tigers.

1163
01:32:43,077 --> 01:32:46,820
Look. You just keep those Tigers busy,
and we'll take care of the rest.

1164
01:32:47,078 --> 01:32:50,972
The only way I got to keep the Tigers busy
is to let them shoot holes in me.

1165
01:32:51,717 --> 01:32:54,206
We just want you to keep them interested
for a while.

1166
01:32:54,534 --> 01:32:56,836
Oh, man! You guys are crazy!

1167
01:32:56,998 --> 01:33:00,063
When we was in the bocage country,
we was assaulted by them Tigers!

1168
01:33:00,133 --> 01:33:02,949
You know what I mean by "assaulted"?
Well, I mean assaulted!

1169
01:33:03,014 --> 01:33:05,884
Why don't you knock it off
with them negative waves?

1170
01:33:06,694 --> 01:33:09,596
Why don't you dig
how beautiful it is out here?

1171
01:33:09,927 --> 01:33:14,051
Why don't you say something righteous
and hopeful for a change?

1172
01:33:15,207 --> 01:33:16,135
Crap!

1173
01:33:16,648 --> 01:33:19,778
All right, so it's a beautiful day.
Now, let's get down to cases.

1174
01:33:20,134 --> 01:33:22,022
The Tiger is an open-country tank.

1175
01:33:23,143 --> 01:33:26,624
We happen to have these and a small town
with narrow streets.

1176
01:33:26,696 --> 01:33:28,735
And we do have the element of surprise.

1177
01:33:31,240 --> 01:33:34,469
A Tiger has only one weak point.
That's its ass.

1178
01:33:34,632 --> 01:33:37,861
You've got to hit it point blank
and you've got to hit it from behind.

1179
01:33:37,927 --> 01:33:39,815
We don't have the element of surprise.

1180
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:44,005
They will hear our Detroit motors
long before we even get inside that town.

1181
01:33:46,409 --> 01:33:49,791
What if I can show you a way to get
into that town so they don't hear you?

1182
01:33:51,689 --> 01:33:53,031
Hey, Oddball?

1183
01:33:53,641 --> 01:33:56,576
This is your hour of glory,
and you're chickening out.

1184
01:33:58,153 --> 01:34:01,666
To a New Yorker like you,
a hero is some type of weird sandwich.

1185
01:34:01,833 --> 01:34:04,255
Not some nut who takes on three Tigers!

1186
01:34:05,002 --> 01:34:06,693
Nobody's asking you to be a hero.

1187
01:34:06,762 --> 01:34:07,590
No?

1188
01:34:07,785 --> 01:34:09,673
Then you sit up in that turret, baby.

1189
01:34:09,898 --> 01:34:11,873
No. 'Cause you'll be up there, baby.

1190
01:34:11,946 --> 01:34:14,467
And I'll be right outside
showing you which way to go.

1191
01:34:16,426 --> 01:34:17,287
Yeah?

1192
01:34:17,642 --> 01:34:18,503
Yeah.

1193
01:34:20,650 --> 01:34:24,906
Crazy. I mean, so many positive waves,
maybe we can't lose. You're on.

1194
01:34:33,707 --> 01:34:34,787
You got anything?

1195
01:34:35,596 --> 01:34:36,773
No, not much.

1196
01:34:36,843 --> 01:34:40,356
They just keep coming and going
from the brown building behind the bank.

1197
01:34:41,708 --> 01:34:42,984
-Cowboy?
-Yeah?

1198
01:34:43,052 --> 01:34:45,093
In 20 minutes, start ringing that bell.

1199
01:34:45,165 --> 01:34:47,433
Keep ringing it as long as you can. Got it?

1200
01:34:47,499 --> 01:34:48,514
Right, Kelly.

1201
01:34:48,588 --> 01:34:52,582
Gutkowski, five minutes afterwards,
get the guards on top of the bank.

1202
01:34:52,653 --> 01:34:53,602
Okay, Kelly.

1203
01:34:57,868 --> 01:34:59,362
All right, let's move out.

1204
01:36:52,882 --> 01:36:54,770
-Hold it!
-Hold it!

1205
01:37:04,115 --> 01:37:06,352
Kelly, where in the heck are you, man?

1206
01:37:06,740 --> 01:37:09,228
We're just outside of town.
How's it look up there?

1207
01:37:09,780 --> 01:37:12,333
Well, it doesn't look too good from here.

1208
01:37:12,404 --> 01:37:14,738
They've got all those Tigers fired up
down there.

1209
01:37:14,804 --> 01:37:17,554
Looks like they're getting ready
for some heavy duty action.

1210
01:37:17,844 --> 01:37:20,179
I think we ought to pull out ofhere, pal.

1211
01:37:20,245 --> 01:37:21,771
No, stay right there.

1212
01:37:22,836 --> 01:37:23,981
That's just routine.

1213
01:37:24,052 --> 01:37:27,402
The Tigers turn their engines over
for 20 minutes every three, four hours.

1214
01:37:28,405 --> 01:37:30,096
Just routine, Cowboy. Stay put.

1215
01:37:30,581 --> 01:37:32,075
Routine?

1216
01:37:33,301 --> 01:37:35,276
Boy, I sure hope you're right, Kelly.

1217
01:37:35,477 --> 01:37:39,056
'Cause our asses will be hanging out
up here if you ain't. I'm not kidding.

1218
01:37:39,222 --> 01:37:42,517
Nothing's gonna be hanging out.
Now, just relax. Out.

1219
01:37:43,638 --> 01:37:45,493
Sure you're right about those Tigers?

1220
01:37:45,654 --> 01:37:46,702
Sure, I'm right.

1221
01:37:46,774 --> 01:37:50,419
Ifthose engines are turning over,
we can sneak right up the edge of town.

1222
01:37:50,486 --> 01:37:51,663
Nobody would hear us.

1223
01:37:52,310 --> 01:37:53,139
Right.

1224
01:37:53,654 --> 01:37:54,701
Shall I move out?

1225
01:37:55,574 --> 01:37:56,305
Good man.

1226
01:37:57,175 --> 01:37:58,288
Move out!

1227
01:38:29,465 --> 01:38:30,446
Babra!

1228
01:39:53,469 --> 01:39:54,549
Come on.

1229
01:40:09,437 --> 01:40:10,485
Hold it!

1230
01:40:15,711 --> 01:40:17,849
Stay here, until I signal you.

1231
01:43:41,738 --> 01:43:43,265
I'm mounting up, partner.

1232
01:43:43,529 --> 01:43:46,399
Don't you get lonely up here
without me now, you hear?

1233
01:46:03,889 --> 01:46:06,257
All right, let's go!
Switch it on and move it out!

1234
01:46:58,260 --> 01:46:59,121
Hold it!

1235
01:46:59,188 --> 01:47:00,399
Hold it!

1236
01:47:12,374 --> 01:47:13,934
Give me that hand radio.

1237
01:47:32,247 --> 01:47:34,702
The bell's making so much noise,
he can't hear us.

1238
01:47:34,807 --> 01:47:36,694
I thought that was what you wanted!

1239
01:47:36,758 --> 01:47:40,304
So the Germans can't hear us.
Now, move them out. Slow.

1240
01:47:41,048 --> 01:47:42,324
Move out! Slow!

1241
01:48:23,642 --> 01:48:24,535
Now!

1242
01:48:50,011 --> 01:48:51,157
Hold it! Hold it!

1243
01:49:33,885 --> 01:49:34,965
Hold it!

1244
01:49:56,638 --> 01:49:59,541
It's a mark six. And we got it by the ass.

1245
01:50:43,137 --> 01:50:43,769
Fire!

1246
01:51:36,132 --> 01:51:37,180
Stay down.

1247
01:52:03,653 --> 01:52:05,180
All right, move out!

1248
01:52:23,687 --> 01:52:24,636
Let's go!

1249
01:52:36,872 --> 01:52:38,365
All right, get out of here.

1250
01:52:38,791 --> 01:52:39,904
Move out!

1251
01:53:46,443 --> 01:53:47,555
Crapgame?

1252
01:54:18,285 --> 01:54:19,398
Over there.

1253
01:54:20,174 --> 01:54:21,384
Come on, you idiot.

1254
01:54:31,278 --> 01:54:33,766
Will you knock it off
with those cockamamie bells?

1255
01:54:33,838 --> 01:54:35,266
Kelly told me to ring them.

1256
01:54:35,341 --> 01:54:38,189
I know, but they know we're here already.
So, knock it off.

1257
01:54:39,119 --> 01:54:40,493
God Almighty!

1258
01:54:42,927 --> 01:54:45,512
You guys smell like you fell
into a dung heap.

1259
01:54:45,774 --> 01:54:47,880
It kind of makes you homesick, don't it?

1260
01:54:50,447 --> 01:54:52,389
It does kind of, doesn't it, old buddy?

1261
01:54:52,464 --> 01:54:53,325
Yeah.

1262
01:55:01,584 --> 01:55:02,664
Pull it.

1263
01:55:31,858 --> 01:55:34,126
-Let's go!
-All right, move out!

1264
01:55:45,714 --> 01:55:47,624
All right, ready to turn right.

1265
01:55:48,370 --> 01:55:49,319
Turn!

1266
01:55:54,418 --> 01:55:55,366
Now.

1267
01:55:55,538 --> 01:55:56,432
Hold it!

1268
01:55:59,699 --> 01:56:00,779
Fire!

1269
01:56:06,035 --> 01:56:07,018
That's paint!

1270
01:56:07,092 --> 01:56:08,019
Load up!

1271
01:56:30,005 --> 01:56:31,411
Okay? Fire!

1272
01:57:04,599 --> 01:57:07,982
We need explosives to get these open.
This place is built like Fort Knox!

1273
01:57:08,055 --> 01:57:10,836
Cowboy, check around and see
ifthere's a back door.

1274
01:57:16,887 --> 01:57:18,578
Can you see anything?

1275
01:57:19,480 --> 01:57:21,650
There's a big lump
in the middle of the floor.

1276
01:57:21,783 --> 01:57:24,303
There's a Tiger coming down the street!

1277
01:57:38,649 --> 01:57:40,023
Cowboy, come here!

1278
01:57:45,336 --> 01:57:47,758
Get a hold of his arm. Take it easy, boy.

1279
01:57:49,240 --> 01:57:50,386
Easy, easy does it.

1280
01:57:50,457 --> 01:57:53,174
Don't tell me to take it easy.
You take it easy.

1281
01:58:49,628 --> 01:58:50,577
Hi, man.

1282
01:58:51,517 --> 01:58:52,629
What are you doing?

1283
01:58:52,700 --> 01:58:56,498
I'm drinking wine and eating cheese,
and catching some rays. You know?

1284
01:58:57,436 --> 01:58:58,483
What's happening?

1285
01:58:59,356 --> 01:59:02,040
The tank's broken
and they're trying to fix it.

1286
01:59:02,109 --> 01:59:03,800
Then why aren't you helping them?

1287
01:59:05,789 --> 01:59:08,506
I only ride them,
I don't know what makes them work.

1288
01:59:12,286 --> 01:59:13,563
Oh, creeps!

1289
01:59:15,838 --> 01:59:17,725
Definitely an anti-social type.

1290
01:59:21,086 --> 01:59:22,842
That's my other dog imitation.

1291
01:59:32,254 --> 01:59:34,644
-Where did he get it?
-Right here in the leg.

1292
01:59:35,295 --> 01:59:36,243
Anything else?

1293
01:59:36,318 --> 01:59:37,464
What do you mean?

1294
01:59:38,014 --> 01:59:39,356
Ain't that enough for you?

1295
01:59:40,511 --> 01:59:41,558
How do you feel?

1296
01:59:41,951 --> 01:59:45,300
Great. Since when did you give a damn
how I felt?

1297
01:59:48,960 --> 01:59:50,935
Okay, wise guy, forget it.

1298
01:59:56,544 --> 01:59:57,493
Come here.

1299
02:00:02,305 --> 02:00:03,385
What do you want?

1300
02:00:04,032 --> 02:00:05,820
How things are going with the bank?

1301
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:08,983
Nothing.

1302
02:00:09,281 --> 02:00:12,827
The Sherman's broken down and nobody
can move that Tiger out of the square.

1303
02:00:13,730 --> 02:00:14,939
Then make a deal.

1304
02:00:15,329 --> 02:00:16,507
What kind of a deal?

1305
02:00:16,609 --> 02:00:17,984
A deal deal!

1306
02:00:18,913 --> 02:00:20,539
Maybe the guy's a Republican.

1307
02:00:22,498 --> 02:00:24,025
Business is business.

1308
02:00:25,602 --> 02:00:26,584
Right?

1309
02:00:29,570 --> 02:00:30,879
Okay, big mouth.

1310
02:00:37,698 --> 02:00:41,310
Come on, Jonesy! Get it going, Dave.
Let's go! Get it going!

1311
02:00:41,378 --> 02:00:43,550
Come on, let's go! Get in there! Come on!

1312
02:00:43,651 --> 02:00:45,755
Come on, let's go! Roll it in there!

1313
02:00:46,146 --> 02:00:48,448
Bellamy, come on! We're almost finished!

1314
02:00:48,771 --> 02:00:49,534
What?

1315
02:00:49,603 --> 02:00:50,618
It's ready!

1316
02:00:50,691 --> 02:00:53,147
Right! Okay, let's go!
Let's move it out here!

1317
02:00:53,507 --> 02:00:55,033
Come on, bring them around!

1318
02:00:58,340 --> 02:00:59,834
Where are you from, Sergeant?

1319
02:01:00,035 --> 02:01:01,312
Jersey City.

1320
02:01:03,236 --> 02:01:05,821
Stand up straight
when the General speaks to you.

1321
02:01:06,116 --> 02:01:07,709
Don't you feel bad about it.

1322
02:01:08,100 --> 02:01:10,916
You're a hell of a soldier,
I just want to shake your hand.

1323
02:01:11,300 --> 02:01:13,918
All America's real proud of you today.

1324
02:01:15,236 --> 02:01:16,578
All right, come on.

1325
02:01:17,732 --> 02:01:20,035
I got a medal here in the jeep for you.

1326
02:01:21,061 --> 02:01:22,174
A medal?

1327
02:01:22,885 --> 02:01:25,700
$16 million...shot!

1328
02:01:26,948 --> 02:01:28,159
It's shot, Kelly.

1329
02:01:29,766 --> 02:01:32,187
Maybe we can use the fuel pump
from that Tiger.

1330
02:01:32,261 --> 02:01:34,148
No, it won't work on this motor.

1331
02:01:34,213 --> 02:01:35,555
Mechanical genius.

1332
02:01:35,621 --> 02:01:36,799
Oh, man!

1333
02:01:37,061 --> 02:01:41,317
Oddball, I can't make it work without
the parts no matter how positive I think!

1334
02:01:41,894 --> 02:01:46,302
This guy in the Tiger, the least we could do
is get him on the radio and talk to him.

1335
02:01:46,406 --> 02:01:47,453
Are you crazy?

1336
02:01:47,622 --> 02:01:52,510
He must be a full fanatic freak! Otherwise,
he would've split 20 minutes ago.

1337
02:01:52,582 --> 02:01:55,965
All this guy is doing,
is guarding the bank like he was told.

1338
02:01:57,543 --> 02:01:58,655
Yeah, maybe.

1339
02:02:00,103 --> 02:02:01,989
But I wonder if he knows what's in it.

1340
02:04:57,872 --> 02:04:58,854
Cigarette?

1341
02:04:58,961 --> 02:05:00,073
No smoke.

1342
02:05:00,592 --> 02:05:04,521
The fuel system is rotten.
We have gasoline all over the place.

1343
02:05:06,801 --> 02:05:07,848
Sorry.

1344
02:05:08,720 --> 02:05:10,314
Hey, look, Max....

1345
02:05:10,801 --> 02:05:13,671
You and us, we're just soldiers, right?

1346
02:05:13,970 --> 02:05:16,142
We don't even know
what this war's all about.

1347
02:05:16,338 --> 02:05:18,891
All we do is we fight and we die.
And for what?

1348
02:05:18,962 --> 02:05:20,904
We don't get anything out of it.

1349
02:05:21,234 --> 02:05:25,032
In about half an hour, the American Army's
gonna be coming down that road.

1350
02:05:25,139 --> 02:05:29,033
Why don't you do yourself a big fat favor
and get the hell out of here?

1351
02:05:30,195 --> 02:05:31,569
I have orders.

1352
02:05:31,635 --> 02:05:34,482
This bank isn't to fall in the hands
of the American Army.

1353
02:05:34,899 --> 02:05:38,892
This bank's not gonna fall into the hands
of the American Army, but in our hands.

1354
02:05:39,571 --> 02:05:41,993
You see, we're just
a private enterprise operation.

1355
02:05:42,516 --> 02:05:44,425
You the American Army.

1356
02:05:45,459 --> 02:05:47,019
No, baby, we ain't.

1357
02:05:48,147 --> 02:05:50,286
You know what's inside that bank, man?

1358
02:05:52,308 --> 02:05:55,690
There's $16 million worth of gold
in that bank, sweetheart.

1359
02:06:06,484 --> 02:06:10,227
That's about 65 million marks.

1360
02:06:11,221 --> 02:06:12,269
And, Sergeant...

1361
02:06:13,173 --> 02:06:16,434
...all you have to do to have an equal share
of this money...

1362
02:06:16,629 --> 02:06:20,143
...is crank this turret around
and blow a hole in that door.

1363
02:08:27,708 --> 02:08:28,537
I told you!

1364
02:08:35,773 --> 02:08:36,722
No more payments.

1365
02:09:36,513 --> 02:09:38,204
You got it! Hit it!

1366
02:09:39,425 --> 02:09:40,700
Come on, Little Joe!

1367
02:09:41,568 --> 02:09:43,456
What are you gonna do with yours?

1368
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:46,074
Get me a new Hudson
with an electric shift.

1369
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:50,520
I'm gonna get me a ranch in Texas,
about 10, 20, 35 women...

1370
02:09:52,129 --> 02:09:53,624
...and let it go.

1371
02:09:56,834 --> 02:09:58,525
I told you it'd work, I told you!

1372
02:09:58,594 --> 02:09:59,968
No, you never told me.

1373
02:10:00,674 --> 02:10:01,721
You never told me.

1374
02:10:01,793 --> 02:10:03,681
Come on, Babra, keep it moving.

1375
02:10:03,746 --> 02:10:05,372
One Cadillac coming up, Willard!

1376
02:10:05,442 --> 02:10:07,231
No, I'm getting a pick-up truck.

1377
02:10:09,729 --> 02:10:11,999
Okay, Crapgame, we got our cut,
I'm moving out.

1378
02:10:12,386 --> 02:10:14,361
Right. Take it easy, kid.

1379
02:10:15,746 --> 02:10:16,761
See you, Big Joe!

1380
02:10:18,211 --> 02:10:19,901
Okay. Stay lucky, you nut!

1381
02:10:21,506 --> 02:10:22,554
See you, babe!

1382
02:10:26,659 --> 02:10:28,001
These are getting heavy.

1383
02:10:28,067 --> 02:10:30,816
-Buy you a lot of broads.
-I'll drink to that.

1384
02:10:31,683 --> 02:10:33,407
Come on, let's go. Move it out!

1385
02:10:34,276 --> 02:10:35,902
Come on, Babra, keep it moving!

1386
02:10:36,068 --> 02:10:37,791
We have small car full.

1387
02:10:38,116 --> 02:10:38,912
We go now.

1388
02:10:41,124 --> 02:10:42,684
You take care of yourself now.

1389
02:10:43,236 --> 02:10:44,251
Thank you.

1390
02:10:55,749 --> 02:10:56,895
Auf Wiedersehen.

1391
02:11:17,413 --> 02:11:18,875
See? What did I tell you?

1392
02:11:19,398 --> 02:11:23,173
Now look, Oddball. The trade
for the uniforms I can understand.

1393
02:11:23,239 --> 02:11:26,021
But to buy this tank, you got to be crazy!

1394
02:11:27,270 --> 02:11:28,765
It's a mother beautiful tank!

1395
02:11:29,318 --> 02:11:30,944
It's a piece of junk.

1396
02:11:31,078 --> 02:11:33,282
The fuel system leaks all over the place!

1397
02:11:33,383 --> 02:11:35,107
It's a piece of junk!

1398
02:11:37,510 --> 02:11:39,900
Always with the negative waves, Moriarty.

1399
02:11:39,975 --> 02:11:42,244
Always with the negative waves!

1400
02:11:42,855 --> 02:11:43,783
Crap!

1401
02:12:12,810 --> 02:12:15,265
The General's on the edge of town.
Right this minute!

1402
02:12:15,338 --> 02:12:17,442
Okay, Gutkowski.
You go help with the gold.

1403
02:12:21,513 --> 02:12:22,593
What do you want?

1404
02:12:23,978 --> 02:12:28,233
After splitting with Oddball and
the Germans we should have 125 boxes.

1405
02:12:28,650 --> 02:12:30,789
At $8,400 a box...

1406
02:12:31,530 --> 02:12:32,807
...that's how much?

1407
02:12:33,963 --> 02:12:35,555
That's $10,500,000.

1408
02:12:37,642 --> 02:12:38,657
Correct!

1409
02:12:38,986 --> 02:12:40,230
Split 12 ways?

1410
02:12:40,618 --> 02:12:42,659
$875,000 each.

1411
02:12:44,459 --> 02:12:46,946
Very good, Fisher. You win a cookie.

1412
02:12:48,138 --> 02:12:49,066
Thanks.

1413
02:12:57,387 --> 02:12:58,532
Thank you very much.

1414
02:12:58,892 --> 02:13:02,689
I just wanted you to know
that we appreciate it very much. All of us.

1415
02:13:03,500 --> 02:13:05,921
The General's coming. Eisenhower!

1416
02:13:06,412 --> 02:13:07,689
-De Gaulle?
-Eisenhower.

1417
02:13:07,756 --> 02:13:08,738
That's right.

1418
02:13:10,988 --> 02:13:13,891
You don't understand.
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

1419
02:13:14,220 --> 02:13:15,398
De Gaulle!

1420
02:13:16,140 --> 02:13:19,140
The General de Gaulle is coming.
Right now! De Gaulle!

1421
02:13:20,172 --> 02:13:22,344
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

1422
02:13:23,053 --> 02:13:24,710
De Gaulle! De Gaulle!

1423
02:13:26,957 --> 02:13:28,997
Vive de Gaulle!

1424
02:13:38,894 --> 02:13:40,618
All right, keep it moving!

1425
02:13:43,117 --> 02:13:45,573
Come on, move it!
The cavalry's coming down the road!

1426
02:13:45,646 --> 02:13:47,075
Give us a hand.

1427
02:13:52,719 --> 02:13:56,515
-What are they saying, Maitland?
-They seem to think you're de Gaulle.

1428
02:13:56,591 --> 02:13:59,406
De Gaulle? He ain't even in this war.

1429
02:14:02,383 --> 02:14:05,066
Vive les Amricains!

1430
02:14:06,095 --> 02:14:07,306
Victory!

1431
02:14:13,935 --> 02:14:14,731
We did it!

1432
02:14:14,799 --> 02:14:16,742
We got it! We did it!

1433
02:14:17,200 --> 02:14:18,477
We did it!
