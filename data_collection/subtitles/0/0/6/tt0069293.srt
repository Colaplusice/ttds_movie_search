SOLARIS
Part One

21
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:49,850
Chris! Come here!
You're just in time.

22
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:55,620
He takes a walk every morning
for at least an hour.

23
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:59,415
He has been working too hard,
all night sometimes.

24
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:02,015
This science of solaristics of his!

25
00:07:02,220 --> 00:07:06,532
He reminds me of a bookkeeper
making up his accounts.

26
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:09,610
We expected you yesterday.

27
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,778
He wanted to run away
when he saw me.

28
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:17,218
Hello!

29
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,773
How do you do?

30
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,858
I guess I shouldn't have bothered
you today.

31
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:41,009
How old we have grown!
I'm only now beginning to realize it.

32
00:07:41,980 --> 00:07:45,609
Everything will depend on his
initial report from the station.

33
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:49,335
Every message we receive
is confusing or incomprehensible.

34
00:07:49,820 --> 00:07:53,415
If he confirms for us that
the study shouldn't continue,

35
00:07:53,660 --> 00:07:56,618
the station can be taken out
of Solaris's orbit.

36
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:59,336
I understand.

37
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:04,019
You promised to talk to him.
I've brought the film.

38
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:06,415
Yes, of course.

39
00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:13,016
Would you mind keeping
the boy for a few days?

40
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:17,850
Anna'll be pleased to have him.
She'll have more free time now.

41
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:28,694
When does he leave?

42
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:32,415
By this time tomorrow, he'll already
be gone.

43
00:08:42,980 --> 00:08:44,936
It's very pleasant here.

44
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:51,692
This house looks like my grand-
father's house. I liked it very much.

45
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:55,131
And so we built this one just like it.

46
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,856
I don't care much for new things.

47
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:28,416
Well, I better get going.
I've an awful lot to do.

48
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:33,777
Don't you want to see this?

49
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:37,254
I've already seen it many times.

50
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:43,016
Twenty-one days after the launch
of our expedition,

51
00:10:43,220 --> 00:10:46,178
radio biologist Vishnyakov
and physicist Fechner

52
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:51,613
went on an exploration mission over
the Solaris ocean in an air vehicle.

53
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:55,369
When they failed to return,
we ordered a search.

54
00:10:55,580 --> 00:10:59,129
The fog was too dense,
and we had to call the search off.

55
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:02,776
All of the rescue craft
returned to the station

56
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:06,450
except the helicopter
piloted by Burton.

57
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:10,858
He came back
only after the dark had set in.

58
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:17,135
He immediately ran to his quarters,
obviously in a state of shock.

59
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:22,412
It was so unusual
for a man

60
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,538
who had been flying for 11 years.

61
00:11:25,820 --> 00:11:29,938
He had recovered in a couple of days,
but he would never leave the station.

62
00:11:30,140 --> 00:11:33,928
And he refused to approach
the window overlooking the ocean.

63
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:38,930
While under medical care in a clinic
he offered to make a statement

64
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,290
of great importance,

65
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:44,458
one which he felt could affect
the whole future of Project Solaris.

66
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,777
Very well, let's hear his story.

67
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:54,779
Now is the time
to let Burton talk.

68
00:12:03,980 --> 00:12:07,370
The first time I descended
below a thousand feet,

69
00:12:07,580 --> 00:12:09,855
I had trouble maintaining altitude,

70
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,376
because the wind had come up.

71
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,938
All my efforts were required
in operating the ship.

72
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:22,218
I wasn't watching outside.

73
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:26,289
As a result, I entered the fog bank.

74
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:28,695
Was that an ordinary fog?

75
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,414
It was like nothing I'd ever seen
before.

76
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:35,289
It seemed to be a colloidal substance,
a gluey mass.

77
00:12:36,420 --> 00:12:38,695
All the windows were coated.

78
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,858
Because of the fog's resistance
I began to lose altitude.

79
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:51,129
Where I supposed the sun would be,
the fog glowed like fire.

80
00:12:53,420 --> 00:12:56,537
Half an hour later, I emerged
into a large open space.

81
00:12:57,580 --> 00:13:01,619
The patch was round,
about a few hundred meters across.

82
00:13:04,340 --> 00:13:09,130
At that moment I observed
great changes in the ocean.

83
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:14,937
The water became still,
and the surface looked transparent.

84
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:18,376
A sort of yellow mucus started
to congeal under it.

85
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:25,539
When it rose up,
it glistened like glass.

86
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:30,618
Then it began to boil,
and a frothy crust appeared on top.

87
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:34,138
The surface was brown
like burned sugar syrup.

88
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:39,929
This substance solidified into big
lumps,

89
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:44,130
giving shape to
all sorts of figures.

90
00:13:45,420 --> 00:13:48,139
I was being drawn to
the fog bank,

91
00:13:48,340 --> 00:13:51,138
so I had to struggle
against this force for some time.

92
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:54,136
When I looked down again,

93
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:57,298
I saw a sort of garden.

94
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:59,219
A garden?

95
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,938
Quiet, please.

96
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:07,379
I could see vegetation, hedges,
acacia trees, narrow paths.

97
00:14:07,580 --> 00:14:10,014
All of this same substance.

98
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:13,610
And all these trees and plants,
did they have leaves?

99
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:17,288
Those bushes, acacias?

100
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:21,532
They looked like they were made of
plastic, but in real-life proportions.

101
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:24,934
All of a sudden cracks started
to appear.

102
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:33,688
The boiling began again,
all was in froth.

103
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:40,617
You'll be able to see it
for yourselves.

104
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:44,608
Everything I saw
will be on the film.

105
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:48,290
Then I suggest
we interrupt the hearing

106
00:14:48,500 --> 00:14:52,857
and look at it
with our own eyes.

107
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:59,049
Yes, show us the film.
It's very interesting.

108
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:38,770
- Is that all?
- Yes, that's all there is.

109
00:16:39,740 --> 00:16:41,696
But we don't understand.

110
00:16:42,260 --> 00:16:46,697
Your film is nothing but clouds!

111
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,131
That must be the fog
I was talking about.

112
00:16:53,580 --> 00:16:55,935
I'm as surprised
as you are.

113
00:16:57,980 --> 00:17:01,939
All this might be the result of
the bio-magnetic current of

114
00:17:02,140 --> 00:17:04,131
the Solaris ocean acting on Burton's
conscience.

115
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:07,935
We know these currents to be not
only a gigantic cerebral system,

116
00:17:08,140 --> 00:17:10,131
but also to be capable
of generating thought.

117
00:17:10,340 --> 00:17:12,774
That is a hypothesis
that has not been confirmed.

118
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,369
Weren't you ill on that particular
day?

119
00:17:17,740 --> 00:17:20,129
Oh, this next part is pointless.

120
00:17:25,180 --> 00:17:26,693
We'll pick up here.

121
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:30,131
...I saw something floating.

122
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:37,930
I thought that it looked like
Fechner's space suit.

123
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:42,536
I kept circling the spot to make sure
I wouldn't lose sight of it.

124
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:47,779
Suddenly I could see the form
rise slightly,

125
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:52,778
as if treading the waters.

126
00:17:56,180 --> 00:18:00,139
I could see the man, he wasn't
wearing a space suit, and he moved.

127
00:18:00,340 --> 00:18:02,137
You mean it was human?

128
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:04,092
Yes, human.

129
00:18:08,180 --> 00:18:10,535
You saw his face?

130
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:11,769
Yes.

131
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:19,138
What man?

132
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:25,216
Who was he?

133
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:29,456
It was an infant.

134
00:18:29,660 --> 00:18:35,292
- Did you recognize it?
- I'd never seen it before.

135
00:18:37,420 --> 00:18:39,775
When I circled nearer,

136
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:44,378
what I saw was monstrous.

137
00:18:44,660 --> 00:18:46,218
What do you mean?

138
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,375
At first I couldn't make it out,

139
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:58,290
but then it became clear
that it was incredibly huge.

140
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,775
It was twelve feet tall.

141
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:10,294
Its eyes were blue,
its hair was dark.

142
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,576
If you're not feeling well,

143
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:17,448
we can recess the hearing.

144
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,298
I will continue.

145
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:33,692
It was absolutely naked,
as if new born.

146
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,937
And it was moist, or rather slippery.

147
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,856
Its skin was glistening.

148
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:46,530
It rose and fell
with the waves,

149
00:19:46,740 --> 00:19:48,696
but it was moving by itself.

150
00:19:48,900 --> 00:19:50,538
The whole thing was repugnant.

151
00:20:01,420 --> 00:20:04,139
Wait a minute,

152
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:07,696
there isn't very much more.

153
00:20:08,740 --> 00:20:11,538
...Burton's statements
would appear to be

154
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:14,300
the expression
of a hallucinatory complex,

155
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,139
induced by atmospheric
influences of the planet,

156
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:20,537
plus obscure symptoms to which
the brain's cortical substance

157
00:20:20,740 --> 00:20:25,291
contributed in some measure through
the excitation of associated zones.

158
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:30,528
This report in no way reflects
the actual facts.

159
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:33,375
Or almost in no way.

160
00:20:34,180 --> 00:20:40,528
There's a different opinion
offered by Professor Messenger

161
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:43,698
who believes
that the information

162
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,856
supplied by Burton
could be true

163
00:20:46,060 --> 00:20:51,009
and needs to be
thoroughly studied.

164
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,060
I saw everything I described
with my own eyes!

165
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,538
I would dare to venture
another opinion.

166
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:04,933
We are on the verge
of an immense discovery,

167
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:11,369
and it would be unwise to be
influenced by the fact that we base

168
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:15,368
our decision upon the observations
of an unqualified layman.

169
00:21:16,340 --> 00:21:20,128
Every explorer may well envy
this pilot,

170
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:24,619
his presence of mind,
his talents of observation.

171
00:21:25,420 --> 00:21:28,378
Moreover, given
the recent information,

172
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:34,619
we are bound morally
to press forward with our probes.

173
00:21:35,740 --> 00:21:38,208
I can understand
how Professor Messenger feels,

174
00:21:38,420 --> 00:21:42,618
however let's look back
at the long road we've traveled.

175
00:21:43,180 --> 00:21:47,014
For all our work, the Solaris probes
are back where we began.

176
00:21:47,260 --> 00:21:52,539
Years of effort
have proven useless.

177
00:21:55,820 --> 00:21:58,778
All we know about Solaris

178
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:04,293
reminds me of a mountain
of separate facts

179
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:09,130
which we are unable to squeeze
into the framework of any conception.

180
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:13,935
Well, we're even worse off today,
as regards the essential.

181
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,455
Solaristics is degenerating.

182
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:21,539
The essential question is far more
serious than just Solaristics.

183
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:24,208
We're probing the very frontier
of human knowledge.

184
00:22:25,660 --> 00:22:28,936
By artificially establishing
a knowledge frontier,

185
00:22:29,180 --> 00:22:33,537
we limit our concept of
the infinity of man's knowledge.

186
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:39,538
And if our movement is not forward,
do we not risk moving backward?

187
00:22:42,580 --> 00:22:44,935
What do you mean by saying
that the information supplied by me

188
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,136
is in no way reflects the actual
facts?

189
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,690
I saw all this with my own eyes.

190
00:22:53,180 --> 00:22:56,855
It means
that some real phenomena

191
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,211
could have triggered
your hallucinating.

192
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:05,377
In windy weather
it's very easy

193
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:08,458
to mistake a swinging bush
for a living creature.

194
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,218
To say nothing of a strange planet!

195
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:15,858
There's nothing offending in it
for you.

196
00:23:16,500 --> 00:23:21,016
What action are you going to take
in view of Prof. Messenger's opinion?

197
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,616
Practically none at all.

198
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:30,532
Our research in this area
will be discontinued.

199
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:33,216
I have a statement to make.

200
00:23:33,420 --> 00:23:38,540
It's not my reputation but the spirit
of the expedition that you offend...

201
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,299
Well, et cetera...

202
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:49,136
It's considered to be good manners
now

203
00:23:49,340 --> 00:23:52,298
to laugh whenever Burton's report
is mentioned.

204
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:59,210
We've known you a long time,
but still I know so little about you.

205
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,694
You were very handsome then.

206
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:08,858
You don't mean that, but thanks
anyway.

207
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:19,538
Well, Chris, what do you think
about all this?

208
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:27,134
I would like to speak to your son
alone.

209
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:31,935
I hate to look like an idiot
before you once more.

210
00:24:34,340 --> 00:24:36,774
I'll wait for you outside
by the swing.

211
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,616
He looks ridiculous, your Burton.

212
00:24:44,820 --> 00:24:50,929
Don't say that.
He's obviously ill at ease.

213
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,777
He feels he's intruding on us.

214
00:24:58,260 --> 00:25:03,288
If he decided to come, it's because
he considers the matter so important.

215
00:25:05,340 --> 00:25:09,219
I didn't want to see outsiders
today any more than you did.

216
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:12,378
We don't talk to each other often
enough.

217
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,456
It's good to hear you say that.

218
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,296
Even on the last day.

219
00:25:36,260 --> 00:25:37,932
The last day...

220
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,934
When the farewells are overdone,

221
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:46,694
you feel awful afterwards.

222
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:52,929
Let's meet after dinner.
We need to talk.

223
00:25:53,180 --> 00:25:57,935
And still, why did you invite this
Burton fellow today of all days?

224
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,131
Where are the guests going to sleep?

225
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:07,377
Upstairs, I guess.

226
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:12,450
Well, I'll be down by the swing.

227
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:15,128
- But perhaps...
- Just a second.

228
00:26:17,260 --> 00:26:19,535
The question of where they're
going to sleep can wait!

229
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,457
Listen, Chris...

230
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:49,538
What's the matter?

231
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:54,770
What is it down there, standing
in the garage and looking at me?

232
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,299
It's just a horse.

233
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,536
I've seen it already.

234
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,139
Come on!

235
00:27:03,660 --> 00:27:06,936
He's very gentle.
Look how beautiful he is!

236
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:18,538
I think that Solaristics
is at an impasse

237
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:21,698
as a result of
irresponsible fantasizing.

238
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:24,616
I'm only interested in truth,

239
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:27,778
but you want to convince me
of your point of view.

240
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:33,135
I can't draw conclusions
based on "reasons of heart".

241
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:36,138
I'm not a poet.
My problem is simple:

242
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:39,298
Either end the research,
withdrawing the station from orbit

243
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:42,458
and legalizing the crisis in
Solaristics,

244
00:27:43,180 --> 00:27:45,136
or take extreme measures,

245
00:27:45,340 --> 00:27:48,138
like bombarding the ocean
with high intensity beams.

246
00:27:48,340 --> 00:27:49,455
No, not that!

247
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:54,529
Didn't you want to continue
the research at any price?

248
00:27:55,180 --> 00:28:00,459
And you want to destroy that which
we aren't capable of understanding?

249
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:05,130
No, I don't advocate knowledge
at any price.

250
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:10,299
Knowledge is only valid when
it rests on a foundation of morality.

251
00:28:11,980 --> 00:28:15,131
Man is the only agent
who renders science immoral.

252
00:28:15,580 --> 00:28:17,536
Don't forget Hiroshima.

253
00:28:18,060 --> 00:28:21,450
Then don't make science immoral!
It's strange...

254
00:28:25,420 --> 00:28:27,536
There's nothing strange about it.

255
00:28:29,900 --> 00:28:32,539
Even you can't be sure that

256
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,779
all you had seen
weren'tjust hallucinations.

257
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:40,138
Thank you for your time. We have
nothing more to say to each other.

258
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,296
- Is anything the matter?
- I'm leaving.

259
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:48,455
Leaving?

260
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,615
He is a bookkeeper, not a scientist.

261
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:56,539
We're friends, Burton, but you
shouldn't say that about him!

262
00:28:56,740 --> 00:29:00,528
We've known each other for 20 years.
It had to end someday, I guess.

263
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:03,456
Are you leaving the child?

264
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:18,291
Why did you have to offend him?
You're heartless.

265
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:21,936
It's dangerous to send
your kind to the cosmos.

266
00:29:22,580 --> 00:29:25,538
Everything is far too fragile there!

267
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:29,130
The earth somehow manages to put up
with men of your sort,

268
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,615
though at what cost to humanity!

269
00:29:31,820 --> 00:29:35,779
Are you jealous of the fact that he
will be the one to bury me, not you?

270
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,776
It'd been established that the Solaris
ocean is a peculiar kind of brain.

271
00:29:58,500 --> 00:30:02,129
Later, even a more daring hypothesis
was put forward,

272
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:05,298
that is the Ocean is
a thinking substance.

273
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:12,609
For years this hypothesis could not
have been substantiated.

274
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:15,935
This program is about Solaris.

275
00:30:17,580 --> 00:30:20,299
Very few true believers
have remained.

276
00:30:20,500 --> 00:30:23,936
First of all, they are those
who are connected with the station.

277
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:29,129
On the station for a 85-strong crew,
only three men are still working.

278
00:30:29,340 --> 00:30:31,456
They are astrobiologist Sartorius,

279
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:34,132
cyberneticist Snout

280
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:37,616
and physiologist Guibariane
who is dealing with the problem...

281
00:30:39,820 --> 00:30:41,378
I'm calling from the city.

282
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,538
Burton!

283
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:48,457
Anna, please, we need to talk.

284
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:59,530
What I talked to Chris about was not
important. I should have told him

285
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:04,857
about Messenger who had
a different opinion at that meeting.

286
00:31:06,420 --> 00:31:10,618
He got very much interested in
Fechner who died in Solaris Ocean.

287
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:18,369
It turned out that Fechner has an
orphaned son, he had left his family.

288
00:31:19,180 --> 00:31:24,129
Messenger and I paid a visit
to Fechner's widow.

289
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:27,729
I saw this child with my own eyes.

290
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:30,535
You never told me about that.

291
00:31:30,740 --> 00:31:35,860
- I didn't have a chance.
- All right, what about it?

292
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:41,129
He looked exactly like the child
I'd seen on Solaris.

293
00:31:42,340 --> 00:31:44,615
Except that he wasn't twelve feet
tall.

294
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:49,217
It wouldn't be good for him
to think about it before the launch,

295
00:31:50,980 --> 00:31:53,130
but he should remember this
when he's there.

296
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:28,776
There's no point in keeping these.

297
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,938
The only ones to be kept
are those in my room.

298
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:53,132
All my research notes, my thesis...
I wonder why we kept all these?

299
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:07,859
Should something happens, I'll find
someone to take care of them.

300
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:14,212
Oh, don't look for the film with
the campfire. I'm taking it with me.

301
00:38:14,740 --> 00:38:16,696
Oh, sure, do that...

302
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:21,616
- Ready, Kelvin?
- Ready!

303
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,610
You have nothing to worry about.
Have a good trip.

304
00:41:26,820 --> 00:41:31,291
- When is the lift-off?
- You're already under way!

305
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:06,688
Station Solaris!
Can you do something?

306
00:42:06,900 --> 00:42:09,937
I seem to be losing stability.

307
00:43:59,340 --> 00:44:03,049
Where are you all?
You've got company!

308
00:45:30,580 --> 00:45:32,298
Doctor Snout?

309
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,614
Snout?

310
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:09,775
I'm Kelvin, psychologist.

311
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:14,216
It appears you weren't expecting me.

312
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:19,775
Did you receive the radiogram?

313
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:27,370
Yes, certainly.

314
00:46:41,660 --> 00:46:43,616
Why are you so upset?

315
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,854
I'm sorry...

316
00:46:52,660 --> 00:46:55,777
Where is Guibariane?
And Sartorius?

317
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:59,689
Sartorius is in his quarters.
Guibariane is dead.

318
00:46:59,900 --> 00:47:01,777
Dead?

319
00:47:05,180 --> 00:47:06,932
He committed suicide...

320
00:47:10,900 --> 00:47:15,530
I knew Guibariane. It's not like
him to...

321
00:47:15,740 --> 00:47:18,812
He was in a state
of profound depression.

322
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:24,619
Since these mysterious disorders
began...

323
00:47:29,420 --> 00:47:35,131
Maybe you'd better rest, take a bath.
You may take any room.

324
00:47:35,340 --> 00:47:37,296
Come here in an hour.

325
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:42,777
I'm impatient to meet with
Guibariane... I mean Sartorius.

326
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:47,292
I doubt if he'll let you in.
He's up in his laboratory.

327
00:47:47,820 --> 00:47:53,531
Listen, I'm aware that something
extraordinary has happened,

328
00:47:53,740 --> 00:47:55,139
and perhaps I...

329
00:48:01,500 --> 00:48:03,138
Doctor Kelvin...

330
00:48:06,180 --> 00:48:11,129
You see...
Please, come in an hour.

331
00:48:12,900 --> 00:48:15,698
Go now, and rest.

332
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:21,019
Now there're only three of us on
the station: You, me and Sartorius.

333
00:48:21,260 --> 00:48:24,218
You know what we look like
from our photographs.

334
00:48:24,420 --> 00:48:28,777
If you see anything out of
the ordinary, not me or Sartorius,

335
00:48:28,980 --> 00:48:30,936
try not to lose your head.

336
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:35,935
- What would I see?
- That depends on you.

337
00:48:36,140 --> 00:48:41,373
- Hallucinations?
- No... but don't forget.

338
00:48:41,980 --> 00:48:44,938
- Forget what?
- That we're not on earth.

339
00:48:45,980 --> 00:48:50,132
Why don't we have our talk tonight?

340
00:48:50,580 --> 00:48:53,538
No, let's make it tomorrow morning!

341
00:50:36,420 --> 00:50:38,376
A. GUIBARIANE

342
00:50:42,060 --> 00:50:44,130
HUMAN BEING

343
00:51:12,180 --> 00:51:15,138
TO C. KELVIN

344
00:51:34,260 --> 00:51:36,137
Hello, Chris.

345
00:51:43,340 --> 00:51:46,298
I still have a little time left.

346
00:51:46,500 --> 00:51:48,695
There're certain things I must tell
you,

347
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:51,130
that I must warn you about.

348
00:51:52,020 --> 00:51:55,535
I suppose you've been told
what happened to me.

349
00:51:56,180 --> 00:52:00,139
If not, Snout or Sartorius
can tell you the details.

350
00:52:01,900 --> 00:52:05,779
What happened to me,

351
00:52:08,580 --> 00:52:10,138
it matters little.

352
00:52:10,820 --> 00:52:13,937
The trouble is that no one can really
explain it.

353
00:52:14,820 --> 00:52:18,369
I'm afraid that what's happened to me
is only a beginning.

354
00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:22,296
I wouldn't wish it, of course,

355
00:52:22,500 --> 00:52:27,130
but it may happen to all of you.

356
00:52:28,580 --> 00:52:33,700
Here, it may happen to anyone,
for sure.

357
00:52:34,180 --> 00:52:39,538
But don't think that I've gone mad.

358
00:52:43,980 --> 00:52:45,936
You know me well.

359
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:51,856
If I have enough time, I'll tell you
why I did this.

360
00:52:53,180 --> 00:53:00,450
If it does happen to you,
you will know it's not madness.

361
00:53:00,660 --> 00:53:02,616
That's the main thing.

362
00:53:02,980 --> 00:53:06,768
As for continuing
our program of research,

363
00:53:07,860 --> 00:53:10,135
I'm of the same opinion
as Sartorius.

364
00:53:10,340 --> 00:53:14,856
Bombard the plasma of the ocean
by high-powered X-rays.

365
00:53:16,700 --> 00:53:21,057
It's prohibited,
but there's no other choice.

366
00:53:21,260 --> 00:53:25,299
We - or rather you - will be drawn in.

367
00:53:28,180 --> 00:53:33,129
It may offer a way
to break this deadlock.

368
00:53:34,820 --> 00:53:38,369
It's your only chance to establish
contact with this monster.

369
00:53:38,580 --> 00:53:40,536
There's no other solution left.

370
00:53:41,420 --> 00:53:42,978
If you...

371
00:56:51,260 --> 00:56:56,539
Doctor Sartorius, my name is Kelvin.
I arrived two hours ago.

372
00:57:08,820 --> 00:57:12,290
Look, I'm in a ridiculous
situation here.

373
00:57:15,820 --> 00:57:18,698
Either you open up,
or I'll break the door!

374
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:23,769
All right, I'll open the door, but
don't come in. I'll come out.

375
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:29,856
My name is Kelvin.

376
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:37,938
You must have heard of me.
I worked with Guibariane.

377
00:57:38,900 --> 00:57:42,939
Dr. Snout told me about Guibariane...
I can't believe it.

378
00:57:43,980 --> 00:57:47,450
So, you know the story.

379
00:57:48,740 --> 00:57:53,450
Yes, it's horrible. I have no details,
I only know he's dead.

380
00:57:53,660 --> 00:57:56,618
All of us may die.

381
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:01,371
But he insisted upon being buried
on the earth.

382
00:58:02,060 --> 00:58:07,532
Guibariane wanted to be in
the earth, with the worms.

383
00:58:07,740 --> 00:58:10,129
Have you ever heard of Burton?

384
00:58:10,740 --> 00:58:13,698
Yes, he was on the search party
for Fechner.

385
00:58:13,900 --> 00:58:17,131
Fechner died a magnificent death,
and Guibariane was a coward.

386
00:58:17,340 --> 00:58:20,298
Please... He's dead!
Why judge him?

387
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:26,895
Duty to the truth is the only concern
that should count.

388
00:58:27,260 --> 00:58:30,297
You are misguided in your search.
Look...

389
00:58:35,980 --> 00:58:42,135
This courage you pretend to
is only inhumanity.

390
00:58:48,340 --> 00:58:51,935
Go away.
You're obviously overemotional.

391
00:58:52,140 --> 00:58:55,132
You must adapt yourself.
Good health to you.

392
01:01:51,420 --> 01:01:53,854
I saw Sartorius and we spoke.

393
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:56,935
I don't find him very likable.

394
01:01:57,180 --> 01:01:59,535
He's a very talented scientist.

395
01:02:05,580 --> 01:02:09,289
I'm afraid
I don't feel so well.

396
01:02:10,420 --> 01:02:14,936
There's nothing wrong with you,
but you won't listen to advice.

397
01:02:16,260 --> 01:02:19,457
Aside from the three of us, is there
anyone else on the station?

398
01:02:19,660 --> 01:02:20,934
Did you see anything?

399
01:02:22,740 --> 01:02:25,698
What were you warning me against?

400
01:02:26,180 --> 01:02:28,136
What did you see?

401
01:02:28,340 --> 01:02:31,457
A human being? Was she real?

402
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:36,129
Can she be touched or felt,
or wounded, hurt?

403
01:02:37,900 --> 01:02:40,289
When did you see her the last time,
today?

404
01:02:42,580 --> 01:02:45,014
And you, how do I know
who you are?

405
01:02:51,180 --> 01:02:52,499
Shhh...

406
01:03:03,980 --> 01:03:07,097
- Where did she come from?
- Leave me alone!

407
01:03:09,580 --> 01:03:10,933
You're afraid...

408
01:03:15,580 --> 01:03:20,938
Don't worry, I'm not going
to think you're insane.

409
01:03:21,180 --> 01:03:26,937
Me, insane? Oh God,
you know so little...

410
01:03:28,060 --> 01:03:30,016
Madness would be a blessing!

411
01:03:37,500 --> 01:03:39,456
Snout, listen...

412
01:04:43,340 --> 01:04:45,012
It's all so absurd.

413
01:04:46,340 --> 01:04:48,615
They don't understand anything.

414
01:04:48,820 --> 01:04:51,129
They're sure that I've gone mad.

415
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:02,936
Though it's something like insanity,
I've got to do this.

416
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:07,139
I'm afraid that Snout and Sartorius
will try to force their way in.

417
01:05:07,340 --> 01:05:11,299
They don't understand what they're
doing. I'm frightened, Chris...

418
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:14,138
I can't...

419
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:17,934
No one will ever understand...

420
01:05:18,580 --> 01:05:22,459
Guibariane, open the door!
Don't be a fool!

421
01:05:22,660 --> 01:05:25,299
That's us, Snout and Sartorius!

422
01:05:25,500 --> 01:05:27,456
We want to help you!

423
01:05:27,660 --> 01:05:29,616
They say they want to help me.

424
01:05:30,980 --> 01:05:33,210
All right, quit knocking.

425
01:05:42,980 --> 01:05:44,936
I'm my own judge.

426
01:05:48,180 --> 01:05:49,852
Have you seen her?

427
01:05:50,980 --> 01:05:54,131
Try to understand, Chris, I'm not mad.

428
01:05:57,660 --> 01:06:01,096
It has to do with my conscience.

429
01:06:11,820 --> 01:06:16,132
I really hoped
you'd get here in time.

430
01:10:50,180 --> 01:10:51,852
How did you...

431
01:10:56,260 --> 01:10:57,932
It's so good!

432
01:11:12,660 --> 01:11:18,371
But you can't possibly... How did
you find out where I was?

433
01:11:19,340 --> 01:11:20,932
What do you mean "find out"?

434
01:11:28,500 --> 01:11:30,616
Don't, Chris, that tickles.

435
01:11:40,980 --> 01:11:42,936
Where are my shoes?

436
01:11:59,980 --> 01:12:02,540
No... they're not there.

437
01:12:13,980 --> 01:12:15,459
Who's this?

438
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:38,372
Chris, this is me...

439
01:12:48,500 --> 01:12:49,933
You know...

440
01:12:53,180 --> 01:12:55,136
I have a feeling

441
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,376
as if I've forgotten something.

442
01:13:12,180 --> 01:13:14,136
What's the matter with me?

443
01:13:18,740 --> 01:13:20,537
Do you love me?

444
01:13:20,740 --> 01:13:24,528
Why do you have to ask, Hari,
as if you didn't know.

445
01:13:24,740 --> 01:13:27,891
I've got to go out.
I won't be long, wait here.

446
01:13:28,100 --> 01:13:31,775
- Can't I come with you?
- No. I'll be back soon.

447
01:13:33,500 --> 01:13:34,774
No!

448
01:13:34,980 --> 01:13:37,016
Why?

449
01:13:40,740 --> 01:13:43,300
I don't know...
I can't...

450
01:13:43,500 --> 01:13:45,456
You can't what?

451
01:13:46,580 --> 01:13:51,529
I feel like I've got to be with you...
all the time, to see you...

452
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:57,451
Why are you being so childish?
I've work to do, Hari.

453
01:14:05,180 --> 01:14:07,535
You're right, I'm acting childish.

454
01:14:09,660 --> 01:14:15,132
As for you, you're as nervous
as Snout.

455
01:14:16,900 --> 01:14:19,539
- As who?
- As Doctor Snout.

456
01:14:20,060 --> 01:14:23,609
How do you know...

457
01:14:27,580 --> 01:14:30,856
I've got to go.
If you want, you can come with me.

458
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:37,130
But you won't be able to get
into a suit with your dress on.

459
01:14:40,980 --> 01:14:43,699
Help me, I can't do it by myself.

460
01:15:28,580 --> 01:15:30,616
Why do you keep staring at me?
