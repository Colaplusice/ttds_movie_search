1
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:10,378
- Mrs. Teasdale...
- Yes, your Excellency?

2
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:12,547
I again ask you to reconsider.

3
00:01:12,589 --> 00:01:16,635
Gentlemen, I've already loaned Freedonia
more than half the fortune my husband left me.

4
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:22,141
I consider that money lost. And now
you're asking for another $20 million.

5
00:01:23,434 --> 00:01:26,145
But it would only be for a few months
to meet this present emergency.

6
00:01:26,187 --> 00:01:27,813
With $20 million
in the treasury,

7
00:01:27,855 --> 00:01:29,732
we can announce an immediate
reduction in the taxes.

8
00:01:29,773 --> 00:01:31,443
That's all of the people
are asking for.

9
00:01:31,485 --> 00:01:33,862
I'm sorry, but I'm inclined
to agree with the people.

10
00:01:33,904 --> 00:01:35,906
- The government has been mismanaged.
- What?

11
00:01:36,031 --> 00:01:40,076
I will lend the money but only on condition
that his Excellency withdraw

12
00:01:40,118 --> 00:01:41,912
and place the government
in new hands.

13
00:01:41,953 --> 00:01:44,873
- You ask me to give up my office?
- Yes, your Excellency.

14
00:01:44,915 --> 00:01:47,919
In a crisis like this,
I feel Freedonia needs a new leader,

15
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:49,962
a progressive,
fearless fighter!

16
00:01:50,004 --> 00:01:54,425
- A man like Rufus T. Firefly!
- Rufus T. Firefly?

17
00:01:54,467 --> 00:01:59,890
I will lend the money to Freedonia
only if Firefly is appointed leader.

18
00:02:22,831 --> 00:02:26,292
The honorable Secretary
of Finance and Party.

19
00:02:35,636 --> 00:02:39,181
His Excellency, Ambassador
Trentino of Sylvania.

20
00:02:47,524 --> 00:02:49,568
- Ambassador.
- Mrs. Teasdale.

21
00:02:50,777 --> 00:02:52,487
It was so good
of you to come.

22
00:02:52,571 --> 00:02:54,823
I'm anxious for you
to meet the new leader of our country.

23
00:02:54,865 --> 00:02:57,534
No matter who rules in Freedonia,
Mrs. Teasdale, to me

24
00:02:57,576 --> 00:03:00,371
you will always be
the first lady of the land.

25
00:03:00,496 --> 00:03:03,583
Oh, permit me.
This is Miss Vera Marcal.

26
00:03:03,624 --> 00:03:05,793
- Ambassador Trentino.
- Miss Marcal needs no introduction,

27
00:03:05,835 --> 00:03:08,212
I've seen her dance
many times at the theater.

28
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,755
Thank you.

29
00:03:10,756 --> 00:03:13,301
The honorable
Pandooh of Mifhtan.

30
00:03:13,342 --> 00:03:14,803
I must greet
his honor.

31
00:03:21,727 --> 00:03:24,313
- What have you found out?
- Nothing, I've been waiting to hear from you.

32
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:27,274
I've given up the idea
of a revolution. I have a better plan.

33
00:03:27,316 --> 00:03:31,821
I can gain control of Freedonia
much easier by marrying Mrs. Teasdale.

34
00:03:32,489 --> 00:03:34,073
Maybe that's not going
to be so easy.

35
00:03:34,157 --> 00:03:39,829
Oh, from what I hear, you see, Mrs. Teasdale
is rather sweet on this Rufus T. Firefly.

36
00:03:39,871 --> 00:03:43,124
Oh well, that's where you come in.
I'm going to place him in your hands.

37
00:03:43,166 --> 00:03:46,629
And I don't have to tell you
what to do or how to... careful.

38
00:03:48,297 --> 00:03:50,799
I want you to meet his
Excellency's Secretary.

39
00:03:50,841 --> 00:03:53,677
- Bob Roland. Ambassador Trentino.
- How do you do, sir?

40
00:03:53,719 --> 00:03:56,180
- Miss Marcal.
- We've met.

41
00:03:56,222 --> 00:03:58,934
I hope his Excellency
gets here soon.

42
00:03:58,975 --> 00:04:02,062
His Excellency makes it a point
always to be on time.

43
00:04:02,103 --> 00:04:05,607
As long as I've known him,
he's never been late for an appointment.

44
00:04:05,649 --> 00:04:09,194
His Excellency is due
to take his station

45
00:04:09,236 --> 00:04:12,614
Beginning his new
administration

46
00:04:12,656 --> 00:04:15,535
He'll make his appearance
when

47
00:04:15,576 --> 00:04:19,413
The clock on the wall
strikes ten

48
00:04:19,455 --> 00:04:22,917
When the clock on the wall
strikes ten

49
00:04:22,959 --> 00:04:27,004
All you loyal ladies
and you patriotic men

50
00:04:27,046 --> 00:04:31,385
Let's sing the
national anthem when

51
00:04:31,426 --> 00:04:35,097
The clock on the wall
strikes ten

52
00:04:41,895 --> 00:04:45,859
His Excellency is due
to take his station

53
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:49,154
Beginning his new
administration

54
00:04:49,195 --> 00:04:51,906
He'll make his appearance
when

55
00:04:51,948 --> 00:04:56,494
The clock on the wall
strikes ten

56
00:05:02,543 --> 00:05:04,378
We'll give him
a rousing cheer

57
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:07,131
To show him
we're glad he's here

58
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:14,306
Hail, hail Freedonia

59
00:05:16,641 --> 00:05:21,479
Hail, hail Freedonia

60
00:05:21,521 --> 00:05:25,066
Land of the brave

61
00:05:25,108 --> 00:05:30,656
and free

62
00:05:42,961 --> 00:05:46,548
Hail, hail Freedonia

63
00:05:46,590 --> 00:05:52,971
Land of the brave
and free

64
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:59,854
Hail, hail Freedonia

65
00:05:59,896 --> 00:06:05,652
Land of the brave
and free

66
00:06:14,286 --> 00:06:17,206
- You expecting somebody?
- Yes.

67
00:06:17,581 --> 00:06:21,043
Hail, hail Freedonia

68
00:06:21,085 --> 00:06:26,715
Land of the brave
and free

69
00:06:26,757 --> 00:06:31,012
Oh, your Excellency,
we've been expecting you.

70
00:06:31,096 --> 00:06:33,098
As chairwoman
of the reception committe,

71
00:06:33,139 --> 00:06:36,726
I extend the good wishes of
every man, woman and child of Freedonia.

72
00:06:36,768 --> 00:06:38,520
Never mind that stuff.
Take a card.

73
00:06:38,562 --> 00:06:41,899
- Card? What'll I do with a card?
- You can keep it. I've got 51 left.

74
00:06:41,941 --> 00:06:45,069
- Now what were you saying?
- As chairwoman of the reception committe,

75
00:06:45,111 --> 00:06:49,657
- I welcome you with open arms.
- Is that so? How late do you stay open?

76
00:06:49,824 --> 00:06:52,660
I've sponsored your
appointment because I feel you are

77
00:06:52,702 --> 00:06:56,665
- the most able statesman in all Freedonia.
- Well, that covers a lot of ground.

78
00:06:56,707 --> 00:06:59,459
Say, you cover a lot
of ground yourself. You'd better beat it.

79
00:06:59,501 --> 00:07:02,129
I hear they're gonna tear you down
and put up an office building where you're standing.

80
00:07:02,171 --> 00:07:04,756
You can leave in a taxi.
If you can't get a taxi, you can leave in a huff.

81
00:07:04,798 --> 00:07:07,092
If that's too soon, you can
leave in a minute and a huff.

82
00:07:07,134 --> 00:07:08,886
You know, you haven't
stopped talking since I came.

83
00:07:08,927 --> 00:07:11,431
You must have been vaccinated
with a phonograph needle.

84
00:07:11,598 --> 00:07:14,475
The future of Freedonia
rests on you.

85
00:07:14,517 --> 00:07:18,730
Promise me you'll follow
in the footsteps of my husband.

86
00:07:18,771 --> 00:07:20,899
How do you like that?
I haven't been on the job five minutes

87
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,026
and already she's making
advances to me.

88
00:07:23,151 --> 00:07:26,655
- Not that I care but, where is your husband?
- Why... he's dead.

89
00:07:26,697 --> 00:07:28,824
I'll bet he's just using that
as an excuse.

90
00:07:28,866 --> 00:07:32,703
- I was with him 'til the very end.
- Mmmh, no wonder he passed away.

91
00:07:32,745 --> 00:07:36,415
I held him in my arms
and kissed him.

92
00:07:36,457 --> 00:07:38,083
Oh, I see.
Then it was murder!

93
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:41,421
Will you marry me? Did he leave you any money?
Answer the second question first.

94
00:07:41,463 --> 00:07:43,632
- He left me his entire fortune.
- Is that so?

95
00:07:43,673 --> 00:07:46,635
Can't you see what I'm
trying to tell you? I love you!

96
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:50,597
- Oh, your Excellency!
- You're not so bad yourself.

97
00:07:51,473 --> 00:07:55,853
Oh, I want to present you
Ambassador Trentino of Sylvania.

98
00:07:55,895 --> 00:07:58,523
Having him with us today is
indeed a great pleasure.

99
00:07:58,564 --> 00:08:02,151
- Thank you, but I can't stay very long.
- That's even a greater pleasure.

100
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:05,488
Now how about lending this
country $20 million, you old skinflint?

101
00:08:05,530 --> 00:08:09,367
$20 million is a lot of money.
I'd have to take that up with my Minister of Finance.

102
00:08:09,408 --> 00:08:12,246
Well, in the meantime,
could you let me have $12 until payday?

103
00:08:12,287 --> 00:08:14,498
- $12?
- Don't be scared. You'll get it back.

104
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,291
I'll give you my personal note
for 90 days.

105
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,085
If it isn't paid by then,
you can keep the note.

106
00:08:18,377 --> 00:08:21,630
Your Excellency, haven't we seen
each other somewhere before?

107
00:08:21,672 --> 00:08:24,508
I don't think so. I'm not sure
I'm seeing you now. Must be something I ate.

108
00:08:25,092 --> 00:08:28,930
- Look here Sir! Are you trying to...
- Don't look now...

109
00:08:28,972 --> 00:08:31,808
but there's one man too many
in this room, and I think it's you.

110
00:08:32,225 --> 00:08:34,477
Oh, I'm so sorry.

111
00:08:35,395 --> 00:08:38,648
- I want you to meet a very charming lady.
- And it's about time.

112
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,609
Just a moment!

113
00:08:41,277 --> 00:08:43,404
I want to present
Miss Vera Marcal.

114
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:47,032
- Go ahead. I can take it.
- Oh, you don't understand.

115
00:08:47,074 --> 00:08:50,578
- This is Vera Marcal, the famous dancer.
- Is that so?

116
00:08:50,619 --> 00:08:52,496
Can you do this one?

117
00:08:55,542 --> 00:08:57,210
I danced before
Napoleon.

118
00:08:57,252 --> 00:09:00,672
No, napoleon danced before me.
In fact, he danced 200 years before me.

119
00:09:00,714 --> 00:09:03,717
Here's one I picked up
in a dance hall.

120
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:07,512
Here's another one I
picked up in a dance hall.

121
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:13,019
Perhaps sometime we get
a chance to dance together, huh?

122
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:15,188
I could dance with you
'til the cows come home.

123
00:09:15,229 --> 00:09:18,441
On second thought, I'd rather dance with
the cows 'til you come home.

124
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:21,402
- Where is my secretary?
- Here I am.

125
00:09:21,611 --> 00:09:23,070
Good heavens, your Excellency!

126
00:09:23,112 --> 00:09:24,697
- Take a letter.
- Who to?

127
00:09:24,739 --> 00:09:26,366
To my dentist.

128
00:09:26,491 --> 00:09:31,788
"Dear dentist, enclosed
find check for $500. Yours very truly."
Send it off immediately!

129
00:09:31,914 --> 00:09:35,083
- I'll have to enclose the check first.
- You do and I'll fire you.

130
00:09:35,125 --> 00:09:38,462
Your Excellency,
the eyes of the world are upon you.

131
00:09:38,962 --> 00:09:42,592
Notables from every country
are gathered here in your honor.

132
00:09:42,634 --> 00:09:45,011
This is a gala day for you.

133
00:09:45,053 --> 00:09:47,972
Well, a gal a day is enough for me.
I don't think I could handle any more.

134
00:09:48,264 --> 00:09:51,017
If it's not asking too much...

135
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,231
For our information,
just for illustration

136
00:09:55,272 --> 00:10:00,861
Tell us how you intend
to run the nation

137
00:10:00,903 --> 00:10:05,449
These are the laws
of my administration

138
00:10:05,658 --> 00:10:08,702
No one's allowed to smoke
or tell a dirty joke

139
00:10:08,744 --> 00:10:11,206
And whistling
is forbidden

140
00:10:11,248 --> 00:10:14,042
We're not allowed
to tell a dirty joke

141
00:10:14,084 --> 00:10:16,962
Hail, hail Freedonia

142
00:10:17,003 --> 00:10:19,840
If chewing gum is chewed
the chewer is pursued

143
00:10:19,881 --> 00:10:22,092
And in the hoosegow hidden

144
00:10:22,133 --> 00:10:24,136
If we choose to chew
we'll be pursued

145
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:27,807
If any form of pleasure
is exhibited

146
00:10:27,890 --> 00:10:30,351
Report to me and
it will be prohibited

147
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:33,813
I'll put my foot down
so shall it be

148
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:37,316
This is the land
of the free

149
00:10:37,441 --> 00:10:40,362
The last man nearly ruined this place,
he didn't know what to do with it

150
00:10:40,404 --> 00:10:43,532
If you think this country's bad off now
just wait 'til I get through with it

151
00:10:48,328 --> 00:10:51,081
The country's taxes must be fixed
and I know what to do with it

152
00:10:51,123 --> 00:10:55,128
If you think you're paying too much now
just wait 'til I get through with it

153
00:11:00,633 --> 00:11:03,928
I will not stand for anything
that's crooked or unfair

154
00:11:03,970 --> 00:11:06,848
I'm strictly on the up and up
so everyone beware

155
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:10,311
If anyone's caught taking graft
and I don't get my share

156
00:11:10,352 --> 00:11:13,397
We stand 'em up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel

157
00:11:13,439 --> 00:11:16,483
So everyone beware
who's crooked or unfair

158
00:11:16,525 --> 00:11:19,778
No one must take a bit of graft
unless he gets his share

159
00:11:22,948 --> 00:11:25,869
If any man should come between
a husband and his bride

160
00:11:25,911 --> 00:11:28,997
We find out which one she prefers
by letting her decide

161
00:11:29,039 --> 00:11:32,083
If she prefers the other man
the husband steps outside

162
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:36,129
We stand 'em up against the wall
and pop goes the weasel

163
00:11:38,883 --> 00:11:42,053
The husband steps outside
relinquishes his bride

164
00:11:42,094 --> 00:11:45,473
They stand him up against the wall
and take away his bride

165
00:11:45,515 --> 00:11:47,892
You have an appointment
at the House of Representatives.

166
00:11:49,018 --> 00:11:51,854
Good heavens!
You can't go with your trousers up!

167
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:54,483
I can't, eh?
Well, they'll never catch me any other way.

168
00:11:54,525 --> 00:11:57,110
- My car!
- His Excellency's car!

169
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:59,446
His Excellency's car!

170
00:11:59,488 --> 00:12:02,032
His Excellency's car!

171
00:12:22,095 --> 00:12:25,099
I'm in a hurry. To the House
of Representatives. Ride like fury.

172
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,768
If you run out of gas, get ethyl.
If Ethel runs out, get Mabel.

173
00:12:27,810 --> 00:12:29,395
Now step on it!

174
00:12:36,944 --> 00:12:39,406
Well, it certainly feels good
to be back again.

175
00:12:55,131 --> 00:12:58,092
- I have failed, ambassador.
- I know it, I know it, you idiot!

176
00:12:58,134 --> 00:13:00,678
- I'm sorry.
- You have muddled everything.

177
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:03,472
If you'd started the revolution
as I planned, you in the turmoil,

178
00:13:03,514 --> 00:13:08,020
I could've stepped in and placed Freedonia
under the Sylvanian flag, our flag.

179
00:13:08,061 --> 00:13:09,521
But Firefly blocked us!

180
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,900
Your Excellency, you have no idea
how popular he is in Freedonia.

181
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,568
I've known of that too!

182
00:13:14,610 --> 00:13:17,279
That's why I have two spies
shadowing him.

183
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:20,449
I want to find out something about him,
something to disgrace him,

184
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,493
to discredit him
with the people.

185
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,705
Ambassador, Chicolini
and Pinky are here.

186
00:13:25,747 --> 00:13:28,750
Now, these are my spies.
Show them in. Wait outside.

187
00:13:37,134 --> 00:13:38,844
We fool you good, eh?

188
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:41,096
Gentlemen!

189
00:13:48,854 --> 00:13:50,231
Gentlemen,
what is this?

190
00:13:50,272 --> 00:13:52,275
Shh! This is spy stuff.

191
00:13:58,532 --> 00:14:00,450
- Telegram for you, sir.
- Oh.

192
00:14:05,705 --> 00:14:08,793
- He gets mad because he can't read.
- Oh, I see.

193
00:14:08,834 --> 00:14:11,128
Well, gentlemen, we have
serious matters to discuss.

194
00:14:11,337 --> 00:14:14,423
- Please be seated.
- Rock-a-bye

195
00:14:14,465 --> 00:14:16,551
Gentlemen, gentlemen!
Now about that information...

196
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:21,264
Wait, wait, wait, wait here, have a cigar.
That's a good quarter cigar.

197
00:14:21,305 --> 00:14:24,726
- I smoked the other three quarters myself.
- Yes. No, thank you, I have one of my own.

198
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:26,311
Here, try one of these!

199
00:14:28,438 --> 00:14:30,023
Hey, that's a no good.

200
00:14:37,407 --> 00:14:40,118
That's a good!
That's-a fine.

201
00:14:40,618 --> 00:14:41,953
That's a good.

202
00:14:45,582 --> 00:14:47,250
Now let's concentrate.

203
00:14:47,292 --> 00:14:49,836
Have you been trailing Firefly?

204
00:14:49,878 --> 00:14:52,214
Have we been trailing Firefly.

205
00:14:52,256 --> 00:14:54,675
Why, my partner, he's got
a nose just like a bloodhound.

206
00:14:54,717 --> 00:14:55,634
Really?

207
00:14:55,676 --> 00:14:58,137
Yeah, and the rest of his face
don't look so good either.

208
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:02,224
Well, we find out all
about this Firefly.

209
00:15:02,266 --> 00:15:04,643
- Here, look at this.
- Ah, very good, very good!

210
00:15:04,685 --> 00:15:06,897
Wait a minute.
We must not be disturbed.

211
00:15:08,815 --> 00:15:11,443
- Yes, sir?
- This is a very important conference.

212
00:15:11,484 --> 00:15:14,112
- I do not wish to be interrupted.
- Yes, sir.

213
00:15:15,405 --> 00:15:17,115
Uh-uh, uh-uh!

214
00:15:17,866 --> 00:15:21,662
Gentlemen, we are not
getting anywhere.

215
00:15:26,250 --> 00:15:27,501
You're out!

216
00:15:28,586 --> 00:15:32,089
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah!
Now gentlemen, please!

217
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,636
Will you tell me what you
found out about Firefly?

218
00:15:35,677 --> 00:15:38,722
Well, you remember you gave us
a picture of this man and said "follow him"?

219
00:15:38,764 --> 00:15:39,681
Oh yes.

220
00:15:39,723 --> 00:15:41,683
Well, we get on the job right away.

221
00:15:41,725 --> 00:15:44,811
- And in a one hour, even a less than a one hour,
- Yes?

222
00:15:44,853 --> 00:15:47,523
We lose a the pictch.
That's-a pretty quick work, eh?

223
00:15:47,564 --> 00:15:49,942
But I asked you to dig up
something I can use against Firefly.

224
00:15:49,983 --> 00:15:51,611
Did you bring me his record?

225
00:15:53,112 --> 00:15:54,989
No, no!

226
00:15:57,992 --> 00:16:00,119
And the boy gets-a cigar.

227
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:07,711
Now Chicolini, I want a full detailed
report of your investigation.

228
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:11,966
All right, I tell you. Monday, we watch-a
Firefly's house, but he no come out.

229
00:16:12,007 --> 00:16:13,175
He wasn't home.

230
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:16,637
Tuesday, we go to the ball game,
but he fool us. He no show up.

231
00:16:16,679 --> 00:16:20,100
Wednesday, he go to the ball game,
but we fool him! We no show up.

232
00:16:20,141 --> 00:16:22,644
Thursday was a double-header,
nobody show up.

233
00:16:22,686 --> 00:16:24,980
Friday, it rained all day.
There was a no ball game.

234
00:16:25,021 --> 00:16:27,023
So we stayed home
and we listened to it on-a the radio.

235
00:16:27,065 --> 00:16:29,526
Then you didn't
shadow Firefly!

236
00:16:29,568 --> 00:16:32,070
Oh, sure we shadow Firefly.
We shadow him all day.

237
00:16:32,112 --> 00:16:34,656
- But what day was that?
- "Shaderday"!

238
00:16:34,698 --> 00:16:36,617
That's-a some joke,
huh, boss?

239
00:16:38,286 --> 00:16:42,582
- Will you tell me, what happened on Saturday?
- I'm glad you asked me.

240
00:16:42,623 --> 00:16:44,834
We follow this man
down to a road house.

241
00:16:44,876 --> 00:16:47,253
- And at this road house he meet a married lady.
- A married lady?

242
00:16:47,295 --> 00:16:50,173
- Yeah, I think it was his wife.
- Firefly has no wife!

243
00:16:50,215 --> 00:16:51,758
- No?
- No!

244
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:53,010
- Then you know what I think?
- What?

245
00:16:53,051 --> 00:16:55,846
I think we followed
the wrong man.

246
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:59,850
Oh, gentlemen,
I am disappointed.

247
00:16:59,892 --> 00:17:04,271
I entrusted you with a mission
of great importance and you failed.

248
00:17:04,313 --> 00:17:07,483
However, I am going to
give you one more chance.

249
00:17:07,525 --> 00:17:12,947
I have credentials here that will get you
into any place in Freedonia.

250
00:17:12,989 --> 00:17:16,701
If I can only...
Ah, here we are.

251
00:17:16,868 --> 00:17:20,289
Are you sure that
you can trap Firefly?

252
00:17:23,209 --> 00:17:25,211
Remember, this time I expect results.

253
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,880
- Good-bye and good luck.
- Okay, cap.

254
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,592
- Come on, Pinky.
- Good-bye.

255
00:17:57,245 --> 00:17:59,413
All right, the meeting's
called to order.

256
00:17:59,455 --> 00:18:02,583
Your Excellency,
here's the Treasury Department's report.

257
00:18:02,625 --> 00:18:04,378
I hope you'll
find it clear.

258
00:18:04,419 --> 00:18:08,632
Clear? Huh! Why a four-year-old child
could understand this report.

259
00:18:08,674 --> 00:18:11,885
Run out and find me a four-year-old child.
I can't make head or tail out of it.

260
00:18:11,927 --> 00:18:15,973
And now, members of the cabinet,
we'll take up old business.

261
00:18:16,014 --> 00:18:19,352
- I wish to discuss the tariff.
- Sit down, that's new business.

262
00:18:19,394 --> 00:18:22,438
No old business? Very well,
then we'll take up new business.

263
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,734
- Now about that tariff.
- Too late! That's old business already. Sit down.

264
00:18:26,776 --> 00:18:30,697
- Gentlemen, as your Secretary of War, I...
- The Secretary of War is out of order!

265
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:33,617
Which reminds me,
so is the plumbing. Make a note of that.

266
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:35,703
Never mind,
I'll do it myself.

267
00:18:38,289 --> 00:18:40,040
The Department of Labor
wishes to report

268
00:18:40,082 --> 00:18:42,459
that the workers of Freedonia
are demanding shorter hours.

269
00:18:42,501 --> 00:18:44,044
Very well, we'll give them
shorter hours.

270
00:18:44,086 --> 00:18:46,463
We'll start by cutting their
lunch hour to 20 minutes.

271
00:18:46,505 --> 00:18:49,926
And now, gentlemen, we've
got to start looking for a new Treasurer.

272
00:18:49,968 --> 00:18:52,971
- But you appointed one last week!
- That's the one I'm looking for.

273
00:18:53,013 --> 00:18:57,100
Gentlemen, gentlemen, enough of this.
How about taking up the tax?

274
00:18:57,142 --> 00:19:00,604
- How about taking up the carpet?
- I still insist we must take up the tax!

275
00:19:00,645 --> 00:19:03,524
It's right, you've got to take up
the "tacks" before you can take up the carpet.

276
00:19:04,066 --> 00:19:07,320
I give all my time and energy to my duties
and what do I get?

277
00:19:07,361 --> 00:19:11,032
- You get awfully tiresome after a while.
- Sir, you try my patience.

278
00:19:11,073 --> 00:19:13,618
I don't mind if I do. You must come over
and try mine sometime.

279
00:19:13,659 --> 00:19:18,248
That's the last straw! I resign!
I wash my hands of the whole business.

280
00:19:18,290 --> 00:19:20,751
That's a good idea.
You can wash your neck, too.

281
00:19:21,668 --> 00:19:23,462
Peanuts!

282
00:19:37,518 --> 00:19:38,728
Hey, come here!

283
00:19:39,562 --> 00:19:41,731
Just the guy
I wanna see.

284
00:19:42,148 --> 00:19:44,609
What do you find out
about this guy Firefly?

285
00:19:44,734 --> 00:19:47,947
You find out-a something?
You no find out-a something?

286
00:19:47,988 --> 00:19:50,908
You spy on him?
You no spy on him?

287
00:19:51,325 --> 00:19:53,994
What's-a matter?
All the time I talk to you, you no say-a nothing.

288
00:19:54,036 --> 00:19:56,747
What's-a matter
you no speak, eh?

289
00:19:56,872 --> 00:20:01,085
Stop-a this! What-a you find, eh?
What-a you find?

290
00:20:01,961 --> 00:20:03,296
That's-a no good!

291
00:20:03,338 --> 00:20:05,257
Hey, come here. You're a crazy.
What's the matter with you?

292
00:20:05,298 --> 00:20:07,676
Why you make a face like-a this?
What's the matter with you?

293
00:20:07,717 --> 00:20:10,637
Ah, come on, you wanna fight, huh?
You wanna fight?

294
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:12,430
Come on,
I give you fight.

295
00:20:12,472 --> 00:20:14,933
Hey, upstairs this time,
no downstairs!

296
00:20:15,642 --> 00:20:16,560
Come on.

297
00:20:18,104 --> 00:20:19,772
What you think you are, eh?

298
00:20:30,491 --> 00:20:33,078
Hey, what's the idea
of fighting in front of my place

299
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,415
- and driving my customers away?
- Hey mister, you got a mistake-a someplace.

300
00:20:36,456 --> 00:20:39,334
I no fight. You understand,
this guy he's-a working for me.

301
00:20:39,376 --> 00:20:41,086
I ask-a something,
and he no tell-a me nothing.

302
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,963
I ask-a why he no speak,
all the time he no speak.

303
00:20:43,005 --> 00:20:46,341
What do you think he do?
He make-a fight-a go like this.

304
00:20:46,383 --> 00:20:47,594
Hey, what's the idea?

305
00:20:47,635 --> 00:20:49,971
That's-a not my idea,
that's-a his idea.

306
00:20:50,013 --> 00:20:52,098
All time I say something,
he no say nothing.

307
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,851
- Every time I say...
- Will you shut up!

308
00:20:55,476 --> 00:20:58,229
Hey listen, what are you
doing around here?

309
00:20:58,646 --> 00:21:00,398
Who are you?

310
00:21:01,482 --> 00:21:05,404
Hey, can't you say...
can't you say anything?

311
00:21:05,446 --> 00:21:07,698
- No! He no say nothing, he...
- Aw, shut up!

312
00:21:07,740 --> 00:21:09,575
I am-a shut up,
but mister you no understand.

313
00:21:09,617 --> 00:21:10,701
Look, he's a spy and I'm a spy.
He work-a for me.

314
00:21:10,743 --> 00:21:14,246
I want him to find out something
but he no find out what I wanna find out.

315
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,998
How am I gonna find out
what I wanna find out...

316
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:19,920
- If he no find out what I gotta find out?
- Will you quit annoying me?

317
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:23,048
All right, I quit. All you gotta do
is make him stop doing this.

318
00:21:25,717 --> 00:21:29,846
Now just for that I'm gonna
tear you limb from limb, limb from limb!

319
00:21:33,142 --> 00:21:35,228
You'd think...

320
00:21:46,113 --> 00:21:50,118
You see, I no say one thing, mister,
before when you... No, no.

321
00:22:37,752 --> 00:22:39,296
Haven't I...

322
00:22:41,548 --> 00:22:44,092
Oh! Now,
now I'm gonna get you!

323
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,309
What are
you doing?

324
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:56,522
Why, you...

325
00:23:19,797 --> 00:23:23,426
- I'll teach you to kick me!
- You don't have to teach me. I know how.

326
00:23:26,346 --> 00:23:28,139
Stop it now.
Look out!

327
00:23:30,517 --> 00:23:33,979
- Ohhh!
- That's-a good, eh?

328
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:39,985
Peanuts!

329
00:23:40,277 --> 00:23:41,904
Hey!

330
00:23:44,531 --> 00:23:46,284
You wanna be a public nuisance?

331
00:23:46,326 --> 00:23:48,286
Sure, how much
does the job pay?

332
00:23:48,328 --> 00:23:51,164
I've got a good mind to join a club
and beat you over the head with it.

333
00:23:51,206 --> 00:23:53,875
Peanuts... to you!

334
00:23:53,917 --> 00:23:55,877
- Have you got a license?
- License?

335
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,505
No, but-a my dog,
he's gotta millions of 'em.

336
00:23:58,588 --> 00:24:01,050
Believe me,
he's some smart dog.

337
00:24:01,092 --> 00:24:03,261
You know he went
with Admiral Byrd to the Pole.

338
00:24:03,302 --> 00:24:05,346
I'll bet the dog
got to the pole first.

339
00:24:05,388 --> 00:24:06,806
You win.

340
00:24:06,847 --> 00:24:09,183
Come on up here.
I wanna scare the cabinet.

341
00:24:12,103 --> 00:24:16,400
Hello? Hello?
No, no, he's not in.

342
00:24:16,441 --> 00:24:18,569
All right, I tell him.
Good-bye.

343
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,153
That was for you.

344
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,739
I'm sorry I'm not in.
I want to have a long talk with you.

345
00:24:22,781 --> 00:24:25,242
Now listen here.
You give up that silly peanut stand

346
00:24:25,284 --> 00:24:27,244
and I'll get you
a soft government job.

347
00:24:27,286 --> 00:24:30,456
Now let's see, how would you like
a job in the Mint?

348
00:24:30,498 --> 00:24:33,626
Mint?
No, no. I no like-a mint.

349
00:24:33,751 --> 00:24:36,129
What other flavor you got?

350
00:24:36,921 --> 00:24:40,717
Hello? Hello?
No, not yet.

351
00:24:40,758 --> 00:24:43,469
All right, I tell him.
Good-bye. Thank you.

352
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:47,099
- That was for you again.
- I wonder whatever became of me.

353
00:24:47,141 --> 00:24:49,476
I should have been back here
a long time ago.

354
00:24:49,518 --> 00:24:51,520
Now listen here,
I've got a swell job for you,

355
00:24:51,562 --> 00:24:54,481
but first I have to ask you
a couple of important questions.

356
00:24:54,523 --> 00:24:57,818
Now, what is it that has
four pair of pants,

357
00:24:57,860 --> 00:24:59,529
lives in Philadelphia,

358
00:24:59,571 --> 00:25:02,198
and it never rains
but it pours?

359
00:25:02,741 --> 00:25:05,118
That's a good one.
I give you three guesses.

360
00:25:05,160 --> 00:25:08,496
Now let me see, has four pair of pants,
lives in Philadelphia...

361
00:25:08,538 --> 00:25:11,166
- Is it male or female?
- No, I don't think so.

362
00:25:11,207 --> 00:25:14,086
- Is he dead?
- Who?

363
00:25:14,128 --> 00:25:17,673
- I don't know. I give up!
- I give up too.

364
00:25:17,715 --> 00:25:19,675
Now I ask you another one.

365
00:25:19,717 --> 00:25:22,219
What is it got
big black-a moustache,

366
00:25:22,261 --> 00:25:24,430
smokes a big black cigar,

367
00:25:24,472 --> 00:25:26,807
and he's a big pain
in the neck?

368
00:25:26,849 --> 00:25:29,770
Don't tell me.
Has a big black moustache,

369
00:25:30,479 --> 00:25:32,481
smokes a big black cigar,

370
00:25:32,814 --> 00:25:35,692
and is a big pain in the...

371
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:38,737
- Does he wear glasses?
- That's right. You guess it quick.

372
00:25:38,779 --> 00:25:41,448
- Just for that, you don't get the job
I was gonna give you.
- What job?

373
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:45,119
- Secretary of War!
- All right, I take it.
- Sold!

374
00:26:03,806 --> 00:26:05,849
You know, I'd be lost
without a telephone.

375
00:26:05,891 --> 00:26:07,601
Hey, don't go away,
I wanna talk to you.

376
00:26:07,643 --> 00:26:10,229
Now, where were we? Oh, yes!
Now that you're Secretary of War,

377
00:26:10,271 --> 00:26:11,814
what kind of an army
do you think we oughta have?

378
00:26:11,855 --> 00:26:15,402
Well, I tell you what I think.
I think we should have a standing army.

379
00:26:15,819 --> 00:26:17,445
Why should we have
a standing army?

380
00:26:17,487 --> 00:26:19,614
Because then we save
money on chairs!

381
00:26:22,993 --> 00:26:24,619
Peanuts!

382
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:27,831
Scat!

383
00:26:36,591 --> 00:26:38,551
Say, who are you anyway?

384
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,680
I don't go in much
for modern art.

385
00:26:42,722 --> 00:26:45,225
Have you got anything
by one of the old masters?

386
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,772
Not bad.

387
00:26:50,814 --> 00:26:53,108
You don't happen to have
her telephone number?

388
00:26:58,615 --> 00:27:00,533
Say, you could be
a big help to me.

389
00:27:00,658 --> 00:27:01,743
Where do you live?

390
00:27:05,496 --> 00:27:07,957
Well, it's not much of a place,
but it's home.

391
00:27:09,042 --> 00:27:10,877
Meow!

392
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:16,091
Well, I know one thing,

393
00:27:16,258 --> 00:27:18,427
I bet you haven't got
a picture of my grandfather.

394
00:27:22,014 --> 00:27:23,807
Uh-uh! Not now!

395
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:26,518
Some other time.

396
00:27:38,114 --> 00:27:40,659
- Your Excellency?
- Quiet!

397
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:42,828
This letter's the work
of Trentino.

398
00:27:42,954 --> 00:27:45,915
The man is trying to undermine you.
Now, what are you gonna do about it?

399
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:48,376
I've got a good mind to
ring his doorbell and run.

400
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:51,629
We've got to get rid
of that man at once. I've got a plan.

401
00:27:51,671 --> 00:27:54,715
You say something to make
him mad and he'll strike you!

402
00:27:54,757 --> 00:27:56,884
And we force him
to leave the country.

403
00:27:56,926 --> 00:27:59,805
That's a swell plan. Why couldn't you
arrange for me to strike him?

404
00:27:59,846 --> 00:28:03,642
Ambassador Trentino is a very sensitive man.
Perhaps if you insult him...

405
00:28:03,684 --> 00:28:05,310
He's very easy to insult.

406
00:28:05,352 --> 00:28:08,855
Why, I said something to Vera Marcal
in his presence and he slapped my face.

407
00:28:08,897 --> 00:28:11,108
- Why didn't Vera slap your face?
- She did.

408
00:28:11,149 --> 00:28:12,402
What'd you say to her?

409
00:28:15,905 --> 00:28:17,282
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.

410
00:28:17,323 --> 00:28:19,701
- Where'd you hear that story?
- You told it to me.

411
00:28:19,742 --> 00:28:21,411
Oh yes!
I remember.

412
00:28:21,452 --> 00:28:24,581
I should've slapped
Mrs. Teasdale's face when she told it to me.

413
00:28:24,664 --> 00:28:27,126
- Where is Trentino?
- At Mrs. Teasdale's tea party.

414
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:28,460
- Was I invited?
- No.

415
00:28:28,502 --> 00:28:29,920
Take a letter!

416
00:28:31,547 --> 00:28:34,592
"You are cordially invited
to attend my tea party."

417
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:38,095
Sign Mrs. Teasdale's name
and tell her I accept.

418
00:28:38,137 --> 00:28:39,471
Come on, let's go.

419
00:28:47,856 --> 00:28:49,941
I've got an appointment
to insult Ambassador Trentino,

420
00:28:49,983 --> 00:28:52,861
and I don't want to
keep him waiting! Step on it!

421
00:28:56,364 --> 00:28:59,535
This is the fifth trip I've made today
and I haven't been anywhere yet.

422
00:29:13,133 --> 00:29:16,845
You don't seem to be making
much progress with Mrs. Teasdale, huh?

423
00:29:16,887 --> 00:29:22,351
How can I? Every time I get her in
the right mood to say "yes," Firefly pops in.

424
00:29:22,392 --> 00:29:26,564
Well, this is your opportunity.
He won't be here today.

425
00:29:26,606 --> 00:29:29,108
- Are you sure?
- Positive!

426
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,238
I helped Mrs. Teasdale
with the invitations.

427
00:29:33,988 --> 00:29:37,158
His Excellency,
Rufus T. Firefly!

428
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:42,414
Hail, hail Freedonia

429
00:29:42,456 --> 00:29:50,756
Land of the brave
and free

430
00:29:53,759 --> 00:29:56,221
Gloria, I waited for years.
I can't be put off any longer.

431
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:59,432
I love you, I want you!
Can't you see I'm at your feet?

432
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:01,768
When you get through with her feet,
you can start on mine.

433
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:04,062
If that isn't an insult,
I don't know what is.

434
00:30:04,271 --> 00:30:07,440
Gloria, I love you.
I realize how lonely you are.

435
00:30:07,482 --> 00:30:09,567
Can't we go someplace
where we can be by ourselves?

436
00:30:09,609 --> 00:30:12,029
What can this mug offer you?
Wealth and family?

437
00:30:12,071 --> 00:30:16,117
I can't give you wealth, but...
we can have a little family of our own.

438
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:17,868
Oh, Rufus!

439
00:30:17,910 --> 00:30:20,580
All I can offer you is
a "roof-us" over your head.

440
00:30:20,621 --> 00:30:23,958
Your Excellency, I really
don't know what to say.

441
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:26,712
I wouldn't know what to say either
if I was in your place.

442
00:30:26,753 --> 00:30:28,213
Maybe you can
suggest something.

443
00:30:28,255 --> 00:30:31,967
As a matter of fact, you do suggest something.
To me you suggest a baboon.

444
00:30:32,009 --> 00:30:32,968
What?

445
00:30:33,010 --> 00:30:37,014
I'm sorry I said that.
It isn't fair to the rest of the baboons.

446
00:30:37,055 --> 00:30:39,933
This man's conduct
is inexcusable!

447
00:30:39,975 --> 00:30:42,979
- Gentlemen! Gentlemen!
- I did not come here to be insulted!

448
00:30:43,021 --> 00:30:44,689
- That's what you think.
- You swine!

449
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:46,566
- Come again?
- You worm!

450
00:30:46,608 --> 00:30:48,151
- Once more.
- You upstart!

451
00:30:48,192 --> 00:30:49,652
That's it!

452
00:30:50,445 --> 00:30:52,322
- Touche!
- Mrs. Teasdale, I'm afraid this regrettable

453
00:30:52,363 --> 00:30:54,324
occurrence may plunge
our countries into war.

454
00:30:54,365 --> 00:30:55,576
Oh, this is terrible!

455
00:30:55,618 --> 00:30:58,078
I've said enough.
I'm a man of few words.

456
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:00,289
I'm a man of one word:
scram!

457
00:31:00,331 --> 00:31:03,000
A man doesn't live who can
call a Firefly an upstart.

458
00:31:03,125 --> 00:31:06,712
Why, the Mayflower was full of Fireflys...
and a few horseflies too.

459
00:31:06,754 --> 00:31:08,297
The Fireflys were
on the upper deck

460
00:31:08,339 --> 00:31:10,258
and the horseflies
were on the Fireflys.

461
00:31:12,010 --> 00:31:16,222
- Good day, my sweet.
- Oh, your Excellency, I must speak to you!

462
00:31:16,264 --> 00:31:18,934
I'll see you at the theater tonight.
I'll hold your seat 'til you get there.

463
00:31:18,975 --> 00:31:21,895
- After you get there, you're on your own.
- His Excellency's car!

464
00:31:21,937 --> 00:31:24,439
His Excellency's car!

465
00:31:26,317 --> 00:31:28,611
No, no, you don't.
I'm not taking any more chances.

466
00:31:28,653 --> 00:31:32,823
You can only fool a Firefly twice.
This time you ride in the sidecar.

467
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:48,799
This is the only way to travel.

468
00:31:52,386 --> 00:31:54,304
Hey, Pinky,
come here.

469
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:59,686
Watch-a the stand.
Come on, Pastrami, come on.

470
00:32:54,077 --> 00:32:55,912
Oh!

471
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:18,937
Hey!
Hey what's...

472
00:33:20,438 --> 00:33:21,940
What's the matter?

473
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:31,158
Mrs. Teasdale, I deeply regret
the unfortunate affair with his Excellency,

474
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,285
but his attitude left me
no alternative.

475
00:33:33,327 --> 00:33:37,998
- Maybe we can still avoid this terrible war.
- Oh, if we only could.

476
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:40,001
- Oh yes, I do...
- Ah!

477
00:33:40,043 --> 00:33:43,088
Mrs. Teasdale, I have been
recalled by my president.

478
00:33:43,129 --> 00:33:45,966
- Then it's too late?
- Not if his Excellency will listen to reason.

479
00:33:46,007 --> 00:33:50,262
I am prepared to pocket my pride
and forget about the whole matter... if he is.

480
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:54,392
Ambassador, that's wonderful of you,
but I'm afraid his Excellency won't hear of it.

481
00:33:54,433 --> 00:33:57,019
Oh, perhaps he will listen to you!

482
00:33:57,061 --> 00:33:59,397
- Do you think so?
- Yes, of course!

483
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:00,690
I'll call him.

484
00:34:10,617 --> 00:34:14,246
I hate to disturb you,
I know you're a very busy man,

485
00:34:14,288 --> 00:34:15,872
but I must see you at once.

486
00:34:15,914 --> 00:34:18,417
Where are you?
Oh.

487
00:34:18,458 --> 00:34:21,586
Why not come over here?
Come in the back way. No one will see you.

488
00:34:22,045 --> 00:34:24,215
Well, if you think of it,
bring some cheese.

489
00:34:26,134 --> 00:34:28,344
But your Excellency,
you must come over.

490
00:34:28,386 --> 00:34:31,472
It's a long story.
I can't tell it to you over the phone.

491
00:34:31,514 --> 00:34:33,182
Oh, it's that kind
of a story!

492
00:34:33,224 --> 00:34:36,102
You oughta be ashamed of yourself.
I'll be right over.

493
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:40,107
He'll be right over. Perhaps you'd better wait outside
until I've had a chance to talk to him.

494
00:34:40,149 --> 00:34:42,318
Very well, we'll be out here
if you want us.

495
00:34:54,372 --> 00:34:56,708
- Oh!
- How'd you get in here?

496
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:59,711
Oh your Excellency, I'm so sorry
to have to disturb you!

497
00:34:59,753 --> 00:35:03,673
- Will you ever forgive me?
- After I leave here tonight, will you forgive me?

498
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,217
Here are the plans of war.

499
00:35:06,259 --> 00:35:09,096
They're as valuable as your life
and that's putting them pretty cheap.

500
00:35:09,138 --> 00:35:12,266
Watch them like a cat watches her kittens.
Have you ever had kittens?

501
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:15,269
No, of course not.
You're too busy running around playing bridge.

502
00:35:15,311 --> 00:35:17,563
Can't you see what I'm trying
to tell you? I love you.

503
00:35:17,605 --> 00:35:20,191
- Why don't you marry me?
- Why, marry you?

504
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:21,943
You take me
and I'll take a vacation.

505
00:35:21,984 --> 00:35:23,779
I'll need a vacation
if we're going to get married.

506
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:28,367
Married! I can see you right now
in the kitchen, bending over a hot stove,

507
00:35:28,408 --> 00:35:30,202
but I can't see the stove.

508
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:32,913
Come, come! Say the word
and you'll never see me again!

509
00:35:34,164 --> 00:35:35,916
Gloria.

510
00:35:40,755 --> 00:35:43,967
Rufus, what are
you thinking of?

511
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:47,762
Oh, I was just thinking of all the years
I've wasted collecting stamps.

512
00:35:47,804 --> 00:35:49,555
Oh!

513
00:35:50,348 --> 00:35:54,937
Oh, I suppose you'll think me
a sentimental old fluff, but...

514
00:35:54,979 --> 00:35:59,233
would you mind giving me a lock of your hair?
- A lock of my hair?

515
00:36:00,359 --> 00:36:01,944
Oh, I had no idea...

516
00:36:01,986 --> 00:36:04,989
I'm letting you off easy.
I was gonna ask for the whole wig.

517
00:36:11,413 --> 00:36:13,748
So you've come to ask
for clemency?

518
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:18,586
Your Excellency, the Ambassador's here
on a friendly visit. He's had a change of heart.

519
00:36:18,628 --> 00:36:21,256
A lot of good that'll do him.
He's still got the same face.

520
00:36:22,216 --> 00:36:25,469
I'm sorry we lost our tempers.
I'm willing to forget if you are.

521
00:36:25,511 --> 00:36:27,638
Forget?
You ask me to forget?

522
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,890
A Firefly never forgets.

523
00:36:29,974 --> 00:36:33,728
Why, my ancestors would rise from their
graves and I'd only have to bury them again.

524
00:36:33,811 --> 00:36:38,275
Nothing doing! I'm going back and clean
the crackers out of my bed. I'm expecting company.

525
00:36:38,317 --> 00:36:40,777
- Please wait.
- Let go of me, you bully!

526
00:36:42,696 --> 00:36:45,240
I'm willing to do anything
to prevent this war.

527
00:36:45,282 --> 00:36:48,577
It's too late. I've already paid
a month's rent on the battlefield.

528
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:52,248
Oh, your Excellency,
isn't there something I can do?

529
00:36:52,290 --> 00:36:54,459
Yes, but I'll talk to you
about that later.

530
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:58,838
Won't you reconsider?
Please relent for my sake.

531
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,841
Well, maybe I am
a little headstrong,

532
00:37:01,883 --> 00:37:04,969
but I come by it honestly.
My father was a little headstrong.

533
00:37:05,011 --> 00:37:07,264
My mother was
a little armstrong.

534
00:37:07,306 --> 00:37:11,185
The headstrongs married the armstrongs
and that's why darkies were born.

535
00:37:12,603 --> 00:37:15,064
It was silly of me
to lose my temper...

536
00:37:15,105 --> 00:37:16,941
On account of that
little thing you called me.

537
00:37:16,982 --> 00:37:19,568
Little thing I called you?
What did I call you?

538
00:37:19,610 --> 00:37:22,822
Gosh, I don't even
remember what it was.

539
00:37:23,823 --> 00:37:28,370
- Well, do you mean "worm"?
- No, that wasn't it.

540
00:37:28,536 --> 00:37:31,623
- I know, "swine."
- Uh-uh.

541
00:37:31,665 --> 00:37:34,292
No, it was a
seven letter word.

542
00:37:34,459 --> 00:37:38,255
- Oh yes, "upstart"!
- That's it. Upstart!

543
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:40,049
Mrs. Teasdale,
this man is impossible.

544
00:37:40,091 --> 00:37:43,135
This is an outrage.
My course is clear. This means war!

545
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:46,847
- You runt!
- I still like upstart the best.

546
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:51,228
- I shan't stay here a minute longer.
- Go and never darken my towels again!

547
00:37:51,270 --> 00:37:54,314
- My hat!
- My towel!

548
00:37:55,524 --> 00:37:57,609
I happen to know...

549
00:37:57,651 --> 00:38:00,445
that Freedonia's plans of war
are in Mrs. Teasdale's possession.

550
00:38:00,487 --> 00:38:02,906
- I must get hold of them.
- Yes, but how?

551
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:06,035
We have a weekend guest
in Mrs. Teasdale's house.

552
00:38:06,077 --> 00:38:08,079
Miss Marcal.

553
00:38:08,788 --> 00:38:12,625
Now gentlemen, do you mind waiting for me
outside? I'll join you in a moment.

554
00:38:17,588 --> 00:38:19,424
Excuse me.

555
00:38:27,349 --> 00:38:28,809
Hello?

556
00:38:29,226 --> 00:38:31,937
Yes, I am alone.
No, not yet.

557
00:38:31,979 --> 00:38:35,775
Vera, we've got to work fast.
You must get hold of those plans tonight.

558
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:39,154
Chicolini and his partner should be there any minute.
Do everything you can to help them.

559
00:38:39,195 --> 00:38:43,450
But I must be very careful.
There is another guest in here for the weekend.

560
00:38:43,825 --> 00:38:48,246
Firefly.
I don't know, I think he is asleep.

561
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:02,637
Ring the bell.

562
00:39:06,016 --> 00:39:07,809
Push the button.

563
00:39:58,738 --> 00:40:01,658
- You gotta the plans?
- No, but they're somewhere in the house,

564
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:06,497
and you must find them. Oh, for Heaven's sake,
whatever you do, don't make a sound.

565
00:40:06,539 --> 00:40:11,085
- If you're found, you're lost.
- You craz', how can I be lost if I'm found?

566
00:40:13,212 --> 00:40:15,214
Got a flashlight?

567
00:40:16,757 --> 00:40:18,634
Shh! Shh!

568
00:40:19,886 --> 00:40:21,847
You don't know how
serious this is.

569
00:40:21,888 --> 00:40:24,266
If they catch you, you'll
be court-martialed and shot.

570
00:40:24,308 --> 00:40:26,351
Oh, Vera!

571
00:40:29,521 --> 00:40:31,189
I must go before
she looks for me.

572
00:40:31,231 --> 00:40:35,737
Now remember, whatever you do,
don't make a sound.

573
00:41:25,623 --> 00:41:27,875
You stay here, but keep quiet.

574
00:41:27,917 --> 00:41:32,046
Remember what she said, if we get caught,
we're gonna get, uh, court-plastered.

575
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,725
Your Excellency,
I'm worried. I can't sleep.

576
00:41:43,767 --> 00:41:47,855
What? You're worried?
You can't sleep?

577
00:41:47,939 --> 00:41:50,358
That's fine, now you woke me up.
Now I can't sleep.

578
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:55,071
It's about those plans.
I won't rest until they're back in your hands.

579
00:41:56,072 --> 00:41:58,199
Won't you please come over
and get them?

580
00:41:58,241 --> 00:42:00,868
Oh, the plans.
Okay, I'll be right over.

581
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:10,838
Let me out!
Let me out!

582
00:42:15,718 --> 00:42:16,719
Let me outta here!

583
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:19,848
Hey, let me outta here
or throw me a magazine!

584
00:42:24,019 --> 00:42:27,022
So that's your game, hey?
I'll huff and I'll puff

585
00:42:27,063 --> 00:42:29,441
and I'll blow your door in!

586
00:42:37,325 --> 00:42:38,659
Come in.

587
00:42:40,786 --> 00:42:43,581
Oh, your Excellency,
I'm so glad you've come.

588
00:42:44,081 --> 00:42:47,127
I'm glad I come too.
You gotta the plans?

589
00:42:47,169 --> 00:42:51,673
Why, your Excellency, you sound so strange.
Why are you talking like that?

590
00:42:51,715 --> 00:42:56,094
Oh you see, maybe sometime
I go to Italy and I'm practicing the language.

591
00:43:04,312 --> 00:43:07,774
I'll see my lawyer about this
as soon as he graduates from law school.

592
00:43:10,151 --> 00:43:13,988
Your dialect is perfect.
I could listen to you all night.

593
00:43:14,030 --> 00:43:16,407
That's all right,
but I can't stay here all night.

594
00:43:16,449 --> 00:43:19,286
- Where's the plans?
- They're in the safe downstairs.

595
00:43:19,328 --> 00:43:21,580
I'll write out the combination.

596
00:43:32,926 --> 00:43:36,471
Oh, there you are.
Here's the combination.

597
00:43:36,846 --> 00:43:38,723
Is that clear?

598
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:41,935
Is there anything else
you want to know?

599
00:43:42,686 --> 00:43:45,814
What's the matter with you?
Have you lost your voice?

600
00:43:46,816 --> 00:43:50,653
Let me get you a glass of water,
your Excellency.

601
00:43:54,532 --> 00:43:57,076
Your Excellency,
here's your water!

602
00:43:57,243 --> 00:43:59,996
What in the world
is the matter with...?

603
00:44:03,292 --> 00:44:05,585
Your Excellency,
I thought you left.

604
00:44:05,627 --> 00:44:09,256
- Oh no, I no leave.
- But I saw you with my own eyes.

605
00:44:09,298 --> 00:44:12,009
Well, who you gonna believe,
me or your own eyes?

606
00:44:14,094 --> 00:44:18,016
Your Excellency, I'm sorry,
but this excitement's too much for me.

607
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:21,644
- I feel faint.
- Wait, I get you a glass of water.

608
00:44:36,327 --> 00:44:40,873
- How about my glass of water?
- I give up. How about your glass of water?

609
00:45:31,886 --> 00:45:33,012
What's that?

610
00:45:33,054 --> 00:45:36,432
- Sounds to me like mice.
- Mice? Mice don't play music.

611
00:45:36,474 --> 00:45:38,726
No? How about the old maestro?

612
00:45:59,164 --> 00:46:02,836
Get me headquarters.
Not hindquarters, headquarters.

613
00:46:03,044 --> 00:46:07,424
Hello? Rush the guards right over to
Mrs. Teasdale's and have 'em surround the house.

614
00:49:10,869 --> 00:49:13,873
His Excellency,
Rufus T. Firefly.

615
00:49:13,915 --> 00:49:16,918
Hail, hail Freedonia

616
00:49:16,959 --> 00:49:22,507
Land of the brave
and free

617
00:49:34,436 --> 00:49:36,063
Lieutenant!

618
00:49:36,438 --> 00:49:39,525
Why weren't the original indictment papers
placed in my portfolio?

619
00:49:39,566 --> 00:49:42,779
Why eh... I didn't think those papers
were important at this time, your Excellency.

620
00:49:42,821 --> 00:49:44,656
You didn't think
they were important?

621
00:49:44,698 --> 00:49:47,283
You realize I had my dessert
wrapped in those papers?

622
00:49:47,367 --> 00:49:50,036
Here, take this bottle back
and get two cents for it.

623
00:49:51,663 --> 00:49:53,164
Hello, boss!

624
00:49:53,206 --> 00:49:55,500
Chicolini, I bet you
eight to one we find you guilty.

625
00:49:55,542 --> 00:49:58,587
That's-a no good.
I can get ten to one at the barbershop.

626
00:49:59,255 --> 00:50:03,467
Chicolini, you're charged with high treason.
And if found guilty, you'll be shot.

627
00:50:03,509 --> 00:50:05,886
- I object.
- Oh, you object!

628
00:50:05,928 --> 00:50:09,181
- On what grounds?
- I couldn't think of anything else to say.

629
00:50:09,223 --> 00:50:12,352
- Objection sustained.
- Your Excellency, you sustained the objection?

630
00:50:12,394 --> 00:50:16,064
Sure, I couldn't think of anything else
to say either. Why don't you object?

631
00:50:16,106 --> 00:50:18,608
Chicolini, when were you born?

632
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:21,320
I don't remember.
I was just a little baby.

633
00:50:21,361 --> 00:50:25,657
Isn't it true you tried to sell
Freedonia's secret war code and plans?

634
00:50:25,699 --> 00:50:28,244
Sure, I sold a code
and two pair of plans.

635
00:50:29,787 --> 00:50:31,539
It's some joke, eh, boss?

636
00:50:31,581 --> 00:50:33,666
Now I'll bet you twenty to one
we find you guilty.

637
00:50:33,708 --> 00:50:36,669
Chicolini, have you anyone here
to defend you?

638
00:50:36,711 --> 00:50:40,214
It's-a no use.
I even offered to pay as high as $18,

639
00:50:40,256 --> 00:50:42,634
but I no could getta
somebody to defend me.

640
00:50:42,676 --> 00:50:46,513
My friends, this man's
case moves me deeply.

641
00:50:47,181 --> 00:50:51,352
Look at Chicolini,
he sits there alone.

642
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:54,772
- An abject figure.
- I "abject"!

643
00:50:55,397 --> 00:51:00,320
I say, look at Chicolini,
he sits there alone, a pitiable object!

644
00:51:00,362 --> 00:51:04,949
Let's see you get outta that one.
Surrounded by a sea of unfriendly faces!

645
00:51:04,991 --> 00:51:07,202
Chicolini, give me
a number from one to ten!

646
00:51:07,243 --> 00:51:08,828
- Eleven.
- Right!

647
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:12,583
Now I ask you one.
What is it has a trunk, but no key,

648
00:51:12,625 --> 00:51:14,710
weighs 2,000 pounds
and lives in a circus?

649
00:51:14,752 --> 00:51:16,837
- That's irrelevant.
- Irr-"elephant"?

650
00:51:16,879 --> 00:51:20,424
Hey, that's the answer.
There's a whole lotta of irr-elephants in a circus.

651
00:51:20,466 --> 00:51:22,385
That sort of testimony
we can eliminate!

652
00:51:22,426 --> 00:51:25,262
- That's-a fine, I'll take some.
- You'll take what?

653
00:51:25,304 --> 00:51:27,974
A "liminate", a nice,
cold glass-a lemonade.

654
00:51:28,016 --> 00:51:29,810
Hey, boss,
I'm going good.

655
00:51:29,851 --> 00:51:34,690
Gentlemen, Chicolini here
may talk like an idiot and look like an idiot.

656
00:51:34,731 --> 00:51:37,526
But don't let that fool you.
He really is an idiot.

657
00:51:37,567 --> 00:51:40,989
I implore you.
Send him back to his father and brothers

658
00:51:41,030 --> 00:51:44,409
who are waiting for him
with open arms in the penitentiary.

659
00:51:44,534 --> 00:51:48,121
I suggest that we give him ten years in Leavenworth
or eleven years in Twelveworth.

660
00:51:48,162 --> 00:51:50,873
I tell you what I'll do.
I'll take five and ten in Woolworth.

661
00:51:50,915 --> 00:51:53,876
I wanted to get a writ of Habeas Corpus,
but I should have gotten a-rid of you instead.

662
00:51:53,918 --> 00:51:55,086
- I object.
- Even I object.

663
00:51:55,128 --> 00:51:57,965
- Then I object too.
- You're on trial, you can't object.

664
00:51:58,007 --> 00:52:00,759
Your Excellency,
general Cooper says

665
00:52:00,801 --> 00:52:04,096
that the Sylvanian troops
are about to land on Freedonian soil.

666
00:52:04,138 --> 00:52:06,640
- This means war!
- Something must be done.

667
00:52:06,682 --> 00:52:09,143
War would mean a prohibitive
increase in our taxes.

668
00:52:09,184 --> 00:52:11,062
Hey, I got an uncle lives in Texas.

669
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:14,524
No! I'm talking about
taxes, money, dollars.

670
00:52:14,566 --> 00:52:17,902
Dallas! That's where
my uncle lives, Dallas, Texas!

671
00:52:20,989 --> 00:52:22,657
More bad news.

672
00:52:26,370 --> 00:52:28,831
- Didn't I tell you?
- Your Excellency.

673
00:52:29,165 --> 00:52:32,293
- What's on your mind, babe?
- In behalf of the women of Freedonia,

674
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:36,297
I have taken it upon myself
to make one final effort to prevent war.

675
00:52:36,339 --> 00:52:39,133
- No kidding?
- I've talked to Ambassador Trentino,

676
00:52:39,175 --> 00:52:41,803
and he says Sylvania
doesn't want war either.

677
00:52:41,845 --> 00:52:44,056
- "Either."
- Doesn't want war "either."

678
00:52:44,097 --> 00:52:46,641
Either. Skip it.

679
00:52:46,975 --> 00:52:49,978
I've taken the liberty of asking
the ambassador to come over here.

680
00:52:50,020 --> 00:52:55,109
Because we both felt that a friendly
conference would settle everything peacefully.

681
00:52:56,027 --> 00:52:57,278
He'll be here any moment.

682
00:52:57,320 --> 00:52:59,656
Mrs. Teasdale,
you did a noble deed.

683
00:52:59,697 --> 00:53:01,741
I'd be unworthy of the high trust
that's been placed in me

684
00:53:01,783 --> 00:53:06,287
if I didn't do everything within my power to keep
our beloved Freedonia at peace with the world.

685
00:53:06,329 --> 00:53:08,748
I'd be only too happy to
meet Ambassador Trentino

686
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:12,836
and offer him on behalf of my country
the right hand of good fellowship.

687
00:53:12,878 --> 00:53:16,882
And I feel sure he will accept
this gesture in the spirit in which it is offered.

688
00:53:16,965 --> 00:53:20,219
But suppose he doesn't.
A fine thing that'll be.

689
00:53:20,260 --> 00:53:23,097
I hold out my hand and
he refuses to accept it.

690
00:53:23,138 --> 00:53:25,100
That'll add a lot to
my prestige, won't it?

691
00:53:25,141 --> 00:53:28,144
Me, the head of a country,
snubbed by a foreign ambassador!

692
00:53:28,186 --> 00:53:30,605
Who does he think he is
that he can come here

693
00:53:30,647 --> 00:53:33,024
and make a sap out of me
in front of my people?

694
00:53:33,066 --> 00:53:35,110
Think of it.
I hold out my hand

695
00:53:35,151 --> 00:53:37,696
and that hyena
refuses to accept it.

696
00:53:37,737 --> 00:53:39,657
Why, the cheap
four-flushing swine!

697
00:53:39,699 --> 00:53:42,618
He'll never get away with it, I tell you!
He'll never get away with it!

698
00:53:42,660 --> 00:53:44,120
Oh, please!

699
00:53:44,203 --> 00:53:47,206
So, you refuse to shake
hands with me, eh?

700
00:53:47,248 --> 00:53:49,667
Mrs. Teasdale, this is the last straw!
There's no turning back now!

701
00:53:49,709 --> 00:53:51,377
This means war!

702
00:53:55,173 --> 00:53:56,675
Then it's war!

703
00:53:56,717 --> 00:53:59,636
Then it's war!
Gather the forces!

704
00:53:59,678 --> 00:54:02,889
Harness the horses!
Then it's war!

705
00:54:04,266 --> 00:54:07,519
- Freedonia's going to war
- Each son will grab a gun

706
00:54:07,561 --> 00:54:10,940
- And run away to war.
- At last we're going to

707
00:54:10,982 --> 00:54:12,692
Feet will beat along
the street to war

708
00:54:12,734 --> 00:54:14,777
- We're going to war
- Our country's going to war

709
00:54:14,819 --> 00:54:17,822
- Our country's going to war
- The country's going to war

710
00:54:17,864 --> 00:54:20,825
We're going to war
this is a fact we can't ignore

711
00:54:20,867 --> 00:54:25,080
We're going to war, this is
a fact we can't ignore we're going to war

712
00:54:25,122 --> 00:54:29,626
In case you haven't heard before
I think they think we're going to war

713
00:54:29,668 --> 00:54:32,546
We're going to war
I think they think we're going to war

714
00:54:32,588 --> 00:54:35,758
We're going to war
going to war

715
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:39,262
- We're going to war
- We're going to war

716
00:55:10,087 --> 00:55:13,173
To war, to war
we're finally going to war

717
00:55:13,215 --> 00:55:15,967
Hi-de, hi-de
hi-de, hi-de ho

718
00:55:16,009 --> 00:55:19,054
To war, to war
to war we're gonna go

719
00:55:19,096 --> 00:55:21,890
Hi-de, hi-de
hi-de, hi-de ho

720
00:55:21,932 --> 00:55:25,144
Hi-de, hi-de
hi-de, hi-de ho

721
00:55:25,186 --> 00:55:28,231
Hi-de, hi-de
hi-de, hi-de ho

722
00:55:28,272 --> 00:55:31,401
Hi-de, hi-de
hi-de, hi-de ho

723
00:55:49,128 --> 00:55:52,673
They got guns,
we got guns

724
00:55:52,715 --> 00:55:55,593
All God's children
got guns

725
00:55:55,635 --> 00:55:59,347
We're gonna walk all over
the battlefield

726
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:03,101
'Cause all God's
children got guns

727
00:56:03,143 --> 00:56:06,813
Oh Freedonia
oh don't you cry for me

728
00:56:06,855 --> 00:56:10,943
'Cause I'm coming 'round the mountain
with a banjo on my knee

729
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:14,530
Oh Freedonia
oh don't you cry for me

730
00:56:14,572 --> 00:56:16,824
'Cause I'm coming
'round the mountain

731
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:21,203
with a banjo

732
00:56:21,245 --> 00:56:24,374
on my...

733
00:56:40,224 --> 00:56:43,853
To war, to war,
to war we're gonna go

734
00:56:43,895 --> 00:56:47,565
To war, to war,
to war

735
00:56:56,784 --> 00:57:00,287
To war, to war,
we soon will say good-bye

736
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:04,249
How we'll cry for Firefly
if Firefly should die.

737
00:57:04,291 --> 00:57:05,793
A mighty man is he

738
00:57:05,834 --> 00:57:09,339
A man of brawn who'll carry on
'til dawn of victory

739
00:57:09,381 --> 00:57:12,759
With him to lead the way
our spirits will not lag

740
00:57:12,801 --> 00:57:16,471
Until the judgment day
we'll rally 'round the flag

741
00:57:16,513 --> 00:57:21,351
The flag, the flag,
the flag!

742
00:57:23,062 --> 00:57:26,107
The enemy is coming! There'll be two lamps
in the steeple if they're coming by land

743
00:57:26,148 --> 00:57:28,109
and one if they're coming by sea.

744
00:57:32,488 --> 00:57:35,950
They double-crossed me.
They're coming by land and sea!

745
00:57:36,075 --> 00:57:39,538
Ride through every village and town!
Wake every citizen up hill and down!

746
00:57:39,579 --> 00:57:43,750
Tell 'em the enemy comes from afar
with a hey-nonny-nonny and a ha-cha-cha!

747
00:57:43,792 --> 00:57:45,919
Be off, my lad!

748
00:58:38,392 --> 00:58:41,395
My husband!
Hide in... hide in there!

749
00:58:42,271 --> 00:58:43,481
Oh, don't.

750
00:58:48,194 --> 00:58:52,616
- Freedonia's going to war!
- I'm gonna take a bath.

751
01:00:04,275 --> 01:00:08,030
Clear all wires.
The enemy has captured hill 27 and 28.

752
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:10,032
Throwing 13 hillbillies
out of work.

753
01:00:10,073 --> 01:00:13,118
Last night two snipers crept into
our machine-gun nest and laid an egg.

754
01:00:13,160 --> 01:00:16,038
Send reinforcements immediately.
Send that off collect.

755
01:00:17,247 --> 01:00:20,585
Your Excellency, our men
are being badly beaten in open warfare.

756
01:00:20,626 --> 01:00:21,961
- I suggest we dig trenches.
- Dig trenches?

757
01:00:22,003 --> 01:00:25,298
With our men being killed off like flies
there isn't time to dig trenches.

758
01:00:25,339 --> 01:00:27,925
- We'll buy ready-made.
Here, run out and get some trenches.
- Yes, sir.

759
01:00:27,967 --> 01:00:31,345
- Wait a minute, get 'em this high
and our soldiers won't need any pants.
- Yes, sir.

760
01:00:31,387 --> 01:00:34,975
- Wait a minute, get 'em this high
and we won't need any soldiers.
- Yes, sir.

761
01:00:35,017 --> 01:00:37,811
Chicolini, your partner's deserted us,
but I'm still counting on you.

762
01:00:37,853 --> 01:00:40,356
There's a machine-gun nest near hill 28.
I want it cleaned out.

763
01:00:40,397 --> 01:00:42,733
All right, I'll tell the janitor.

764
01:00:42,900 --> 01:00:44,026
Message from the front, sir.

765
01:00:44,068 --> 01:00:47,654
Oh, I'm sick of messages from the front.
Don't we ever get a message from the side?

766
01:00:49,114 --> 01:00:50,492
What is it?

767
01:00:50,533 --> 01:00:52,869
General Smith reports a gas attack.
He wants to know what to do.

768
01:00:52,911 --> 01:00:56,122
Tell him to take a teaspoon full of
bicarbonate soda and a half a glass of water.

769
01:00:56,164 --> 01:00:57,665
Yes, sir.

770
01:01:00,418 --> 01:01:02,045
- Any answer to that message?
- No, sir.

771
01:01:02,087 --> 01:01:04,381
Well, in that case,
don't send it.

772
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:16,394
Gentlemen, this is
the last straw.

773
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:18,729
- Where's my Stradivarius?
- Here, sir!

774
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:21,900
I'll show 'em they
can't fiddle around with old Firefly.

775
01:01:26,905 --> 01:01:29,991
- Look at 'em run.
Now they know they've been in a war.
- Your Excellency!

776
01:01:30,033 --> 01:01:33,286
- They're fleeing like rats!
- But sir, I've got to tell you...

777
01:01:33,328 --> 01:01:35,623
Remind me to give myself
the Firefly medal for this.

778
01:01:35,665 --> 01:01:37,750
Your Excellency,
you're shooting your own men.

779
01:01:37,792 --> 01:01:40,837
- What?
- You're shooting your own men!

780
01:01:41,170 --> 01:01:44,966
Here's five dollars. Keep it under your hat.
Never mind. I'll keep it under my hat.

781
01:01:45,967 --> 01:01:47,719
Now we've got to have
more men or we're lost!

782
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:51,765
Don't be alarmed, I've got a man
combing the countryside for volunteers.

783
01:01:57,646 --> 01:02:01,400
Your Excellency, the army's morale is crumbling.
The men are breaking ranks.

784
01:02:01,442 --> 01:02:04,571
- Where's the Secretary of War?
- That's it! Where is the Secretary of War?

785
01:02:04,612 --> 01:02:05,947
The soldiers are
waiting for his orders.

786
01:02:05,989 --> 01:02:08,867
His Excellency,
the Secretary of War.

787
01:02:14,205 --> 01:02:16,332
Awfully decent of
you to drop in today.

788
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,543
You realize our army is
facing disastrous defeat?

789
01:02:18,585 --> 01:02:20,671
- What do you intend to do about it?
- I've done it already.

790
01:02:20,713 --> 01:02:22,923
- You've done what?
- I've changed to the other side.

791
01:02:22,965 --> 01:02:25,593
So you're on the other side, eh?
Well, what are you doing over here?

792
01:02:25,634 --> 01:02:28,137
Well, the food is better over here.

793
01:02:32,933 --> 01:02:35,145
Chicolini, I need you
badly right now.

794
01:02:35,187 --> 01:02:36,980
What'll you take to come back
and work for me again?

795
01:02:37,022 --> 01:02:39,483
- I'll take a vacation.
- Good, you're hired.

796
01:02:39,524 --> 01:02:42,652
Now, go out in that battlefield
and lead those men to victory.

797
01:02:42,694 --> 01:02:44,821
Go on, they're waiting for you.

798
01:02:45,447 --> 01:02:48,618
I wouldn't go out there unless
I was in one of those big iron things

799
01:02:48,659 --> 01:02:50,453
that go up and down like this.
What do you call those things?

800
01:02:50,495 --> 01:02:52,455
- Tanks.
- You're welcome.

801
01:02:53,956 --> 01:02:58,169
Your Excellency, you must come here at once.
There's danger here.

802
01:02:58,211 --> 01:03:00,838
Why don't come over here?
There's no danger here.

803
01:03:12,059 --> 01:03:16,021
- Shh!
- Rufus!

804
01:03:17,773 --> 01:03:19,943
Oh!

805
01:03:21,778 --> 01:03:24,739
Wait a minute, I want
to find out something.

806
01:03:28,410 --> 01:03:30,829
Just as I thought,
the coast is clear.

807
01:03:31,913 --> 01:03:34,166
Chicolini, to your post!

808
01:03:34,375 --> 01:03:37,920
Remember, you're fighting for this woman's honor
which is probably more than she ever did.

809
01:03:37,962 --> 01:03:39,630
Your Excellency!

810
01:03:40,214 --> 01:03:42,550
There goes my gun.
Run out and get that like a good girl.

811
01:03:42,591 --> 01:03:43,509
Oh, I'm afraid!

812
01:03:43,551 --> 01:03:46,470
We can't last much longer.
Our ammunition supplies are very low!

813
01:03:46,512 --> 01:03:48,640
Man the boats, Lieutenant!
I'll get help!

814
01:03:55,564 --> 01:03:57,691
Calling all nations!
Calling all nations!

815
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,401
This is Rufus T...

816
01:04:00,652 --> 01:04:04,032
This is Rufus T. Firefly
coming to you through the courtesy of the enemy.

817
01:04:04,073 --> 01:04:05,616
We're in a mess, folks!
We're in a mess!

818
01:04:05,658 --> 01:04:08,244
Rush to Freedonia.
Three men and one woman are trapped in a building.

819
01:04:08,286 --> 01:04:11,831
Send help at once.
If you can't send help, send two more women.

820
01:04:13,041 --> 01:04:15,001
Make it three more women.

821
01:04:15,710 --> 01:04:18,881
Your Excellency, we can't hold out much longer!
We must have help!

822
01:04:24,762 --> 01:04:28,223
One of us has got to break through the lines
and get word to general Cooper and his men.

823
01:04:29,767 --> 01:04:31,060
Quiet back there!

824
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:34,647
Which one of us is gonna have the rare privilege
of sacrificing his life for his country?

825
01:04:34,689 --> 01:04:37,567
- We draw lots.
- Wait! I got it.

826
01:04:37,609 --> 01:04:40,445
Rrringspot, vonza, twoza,
zig-zag-zav, popti, vinaga.

827
01:04:40,487 --> 01:04:44,699
Harem, scarem, merchan,
tarem, teir, tore...

828
01:04:44,741 --> 01:04:48,245
I did it wrong.
Wait, wait, I start here.

829
01:04:48,287 --> 01:04:50,956
Rrringspot, vonza, twoza,
zig-zag-zav, popti, vinaga.

830
01:04:50,998 --> 01:04:53,709
Harem, scarem, merchan,
tarem, teir, tore...

831
01:04:53,751 --> 01:04:56,629
That's no good too.
Oh, I got it!

832
01:04:56,670 --> 01:04:58,339
Rrringspot, buck!

833
01:04:58,381 --> 01:05:01,467
You're a brave man.
Go and break through the lines!

834
01:05:01,509 --> 01:05:04,554
And remember, while you're out there
risking life and limb through shot and shell,

835
01:05:04,596 --> 01:05:07,182
we'll be in here thinking
what a sucker you are.

836
01:05:07,224 --> 01:05:09,935
Good-bye, Mont Blanc,
good-bye.

837
01:05:10,102 --> 01:05:13,230
- For Freedonia!
- For Freedonia!
- For Freedonia!

838
01:05:16,734 --> 01:05:20,655
Gloria! Gloria!
Where did they get you?

839
01:05:21,531 --> 01:05:23,991
Hey, careful with the water!
It's the only water we got.

840
01:05:24,033 --> 01:05:26,411
Well, it's the only woman we got.

841
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,837
We're surrounded!
They're attacking from the rear!

842
01:05:34,878 --> 01:05:37,214
- They're coming this way!
- We'll barricade the door!

843
01:05:47,225 --> 01:05:49,602
This is Firefly talking!
Send help at once!

844
01:05:49,644 --> 01:05:51,646
Help is on the way!

845
01:05:51,688 --> 01:05:54,315
Carry on, men!
Help is on the way!

846
01:06:18,383 --> 01:06:22,345
They got me.
They got me. Water!

847
01:06:27,059 --> 01:06:28,685
Water!

848
01:06:34,108 --> 01:06:36,235
Get me outta this!
Get me outta this!

849
01:06:38,529 --> 01:06:41,574
The last time this happened to me
I was crawling under a bed.

850
01:06:42,075 --> 01:06:44,243
Oh, if help would only come!

851
01:06:45,119 --> 01:06:47,247
Your Excellency?

852
01:06:57,216 --> 01:06:59,343
Any mail for me
while I was gone?

853
01:07:02,305 --> 01:07:03,890
Get away from me!

854
01:07:05,850 --> 01:07:08,520
Oh! Oh!

855
01:07:15,569 --> 01:07:16,987
Hey, Trentino!

856
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:19,490
Trentino, eh?
That's game.

857
01:07:22,034 --> 01:07:24,829
- Trentino!
- Trentino, eh?

858
01:07:24,870 --> 01:07:26,914
Call me an upstart, eh?

859
01:07:26,956 --> 01:07:29,125
I surrender!
I surrender!

860
01:07:29,166 --> 01:07:31,795
I'm sorry, you'll have to wait
'til the fruit runs out.

861
01:07:31,837 --> 01:07:33,964
Victory is ours!

862
01:07:34,005 --> 01:07:37,426
Hail, hail Freedonia

863
01:07:37,467 --> 01:07:42,723
Land of the brave...

864
