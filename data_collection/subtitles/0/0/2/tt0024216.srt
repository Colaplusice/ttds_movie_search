1
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,667
Say, is this the moving-picture ship?

2
00:06:28,838 --> 00:06:30,635
The <i>venture</i>? Yeah.

3
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:34,208
- Are you going on this crazy voyage?
- What's crazy about it?

4
00:06:34,377 --> 00:06:38,245
I don't know. But everybody is talking
about that crazy fella running it.

5
00:06:38,414 --> 00:06:41,042
- Carl Denham?
- Guess that's the name.

6
00:06:41,217 --> 00:06:44,186
He ain't scared of nothing.
If he wants a picture of lion...

7
00:06:44,353 --> 00:06:47,220
...he just goes up to him
and tells him to look pleasant.

8
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:50,951
He's a tough egg. Why all this talk
about this voyage being crazy?

9
00:06:51,127 --> 00:06:55,689
Everybody around the docks is talking
about the cargo, for one thing.

10
00:06:55,865 --> 00:06:58,800
And I never did see a ship
this size with such a crew.

11
00:06:58,968 --> 00:07:01,630
- Not enough men to handle her?
- Not enough!

12
00:07:01,804 --> 00:07:04,034
Three times more than
the ship needs.

13
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:07,074
I don't see where they're gonna
have room enough to sleep.

14
00:07:07,243 --> 00:07:09,905
Hey, down there.
What do you want?

15
00:07:10,079 --> 00:07:12,445
- Denham aboard?
- Who are you?

16
00:07:12,615 --> 00:07:14,515
My name is Weston,
the theatrical agent.

17
00:07:14,684 --> 00:07:17,551
Well, why didn't you say so?
Come on aboard.

18
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:23,191
Denham's getting wild. I hope you've got
some good news for him.

19
00:07:24,427 --> 00:07:28,022
Well, Mr. Denham, you know the reasons
for hurrying as well as I do.

20
00:07:28,197 --> 00:07:30,563
Insurance company found out
we're carrying explosives.

21
00:07:30,733 --> 00:07:32,963
Marshal will be aboard
tomorrow or next day.

22
00:07:33,136 --> 00:07:36,299
If we make a legal case of it,
we'll be tied up for months?

23
00:07:36,472 --> 00:07:39,441
With enough ammunition
to blow up the harbor.

24
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:44,905
What do you think the marshal will say
to these new gas bombs of yours?

25
00:07:45,081 --> 00:07:48,608
According to you, one of them
is enough to knock out an elephant.

26
00:07:48,784 --> 00:07:51,776
We've got to get where we're going
before the monsoon starts.

27
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:55,651
- Trust me to see you through a blow.
- Oh, now, don't get sore, skipper.

28
00:07:55,825 --> 00:07:59,852
You can't run into the rainy season when
you're trying to make an outdoor picture.

29
00:08:00,029 --> 00:08:02,224
Months wasted, money gone
and nothing to show.

30
00:08:02,398 --> 00:08:04,389
Still you always
bring back a picture.

31
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:08,264
And everybody says,
"There's only one Carl Denham."

32
00:08:10,306 --> 00:08:12,433
Weston, I was just going ashore
to call you.

33
00:08:12,608 --> 00:08:14,439
If I'd known that,
I would have waited.

34
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:17,135
This is the skipper.
Weston, the theatrical agent.

35
00:08:17,313 --> 00:08:19,281
I guess you met Driscoll,
the first mate.

36
00:08:19,448 --> 00:08:21,678
Well, Weston, how about the girl?

37
00:08:21,851 --> 00:08:23,682
- It can't be done, Denham.
- What?

38
00:08:23,853 --> 00:08:26,447
It's got to be done.
Now, look here, Weston.

39
00:08:26,622 --> 00:08:28,920
Somebody's interfered
with every girl I try to hire.

40
00:08:29,091 --> 00:08:32,151
Now all the agents in town
have shut down on me. All but you.

41
00:08:32,328 --> 00:08:35,126
- You know I'm square.
- Everybody knows you're square.

42
00:08:35,298 --> 00:08:37,528
But you've got
a reputation for recklessness...

43
00:08:37,700 --> 00:08:40,533
...that can't be glossed over.
Then you're so secretive.

44
00:08:40,703 --> 00:08:42,136
You said it.

45
00:08:42,305 --> 00:08:45,274
Even skipper and mate don't
know where they're going, what.

46
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:47,909
There you are.
I've got a conscience, Denham.

47
00:08:48,077 --> 00:08:51,376
I can't send a pretty girl
such as you ask on a job like this...

48
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,744
...without telling her what to expect.
- What is she to expect?

49
00:08:54,917 --> 00:08:57,818
To go off on a trip
for no one knows how long...

50
00:08:57,987 --> 00:09:00,820
...to some spot
you don't even hint at...

51
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:05,017
...the only woman on a ship with
the toughest mugs I ever looked at.

52
00:09:07,797 --> 00:09:09,822
I mean the crew.

53
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:14,102
Good Lord, you talk as if
I never brought anybody back alive.

54
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:17,034
The skipper and Driscoll
have stuck to me on two trips.

55
00:09:17,206 --> 00:09:20,539
- They look well enough.
- Sure, we're healthy.

56
00:09:20,710 --> 00:09:23,372
But it's a different thing
taking a girl into danger.

57
00:09:23,546 --> 00:09:25,605
I suppose there's no danger
in New York.

58
00:09:25,781 --> 00:09:28,614
Listen, there are dozens of girls
in this town...

59
00:09:28,784 --> 00:09:31,514
...that are in more danger
than they are with me.

60
00:09:31,687 --> 00:09:34,349
Yeah, but they know
that kind of danger.

61
00:09:34,523 --> 00:09:36,753
You never had a woman
in any of your pictures.

62
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,917
- Why do you want one?
- Holy mackerel!

63
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:41,063
Do you think I wanna haul
a woman around?

64
00:09:41,230 --> 00:09:44,063
- Then why?
- Because the public, bless them...

65
00:09:44,233 --> 00:09:45,723
...must have a pretty face.

66
00:09:45,901 --> 00:09:49,234
Sure, everybody likes romance.

67
00:09:49,405 --> 00:09:53,398
Isn't there any romance or adventure
without having a flapper in it?

68
00:09:53,576 --> 00:09:56,739
Well, Mr. Denham, why not take
a picture in a monastery?

69
00:09:56,912 --> 00:10:00,313
Makes me sore. I go out,
sweat blood to make a swell picture...

70
00:10:00,483 --> 00:10:02,678
...then the critics
and the exhibitors all say:

71
00:10:02,852 --> 00:10:06,219
"If this picture had love interest,
it would gross twice as much."

72
00:10:06,389 --> 00:10:09,825
The public wants a girl, and this time
I'm gonna give what they want.

73
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:13,018
- Don't know where you'll get her.
- I've gotta get her, Weston.

74
00:10:13,195 --> 00:10:14,560
We've gotta leave by morning.

75
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,062
- We've gotta be gone by daylight.
- Why?

76
00:10:17,233 --> 00:10:19,394
Well, there's a good reason.

77
00:10:19,568 --> 00:10:22,196
Everything I hear about it
makes me like it less.

78
00:10:22,371 --> 00:10:24,032
I'm glad I didn't get you a girl.

79
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:25,935
You are, eh? Well, I'll show you.

80
00:10:26,108 --> 00:10:29,271
Do you think I'm gonna give up
because you can't find me a girl?

81
00:10:29,445 --> 00:10:32,073
I'm going to make
the greatest picture in the world.

82
00:10:32,248 --> 00:10:34,910
Something that nobody's
ever seen or heard of.

83
00:10:35,084 --> 00:10:38,576
They'll have to think up a lot
of new adjectives when I come back.

84
00:10:38,754 --> 00:10:40,381
- Where you going?
- Going out...

85
00:10:40,556 --> 00:10:44,515
...and get a girl for my picture.
Even if I have to marry one.

86
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:11,383
- Stand aside, please. Get your case later.
- Can I take my things?

87
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,119
Say, lay off the shoving, will you?

88
00:11:16,292 --> 00:11:18,886
- Oh, I didn't mean to shove you.
- Excuse me.

89
00:11:19,061 --> 00:11:20,824
What do they give you in this joint?

90
00:11:20,996 --> 00:11:23,726
Soup tonight. Coffee and sinkers
in the morning.

91
00:11:43,152 --> 00:11:47,282
I catch you, you stealer.
Now, I get you cop. You like that, huh?

92
00:11:47,456 --> 00:11:50,755
No, no. I didn't. Let me go.
I wanted to, but I didn't.

93
00:11:50,926 --> 00:11:53,827
- Had enough of these stealers.
- Dry up. Kid didn't take any.

94
00:11:53,996 --> 00:11:56,260
- Truly I didn't.
- Three people this week...

95
00:11:56,432 --> 00:11:57,922
- Here... Here's a buck.
- A buck.

96
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,624
Scram.

97
00:12:08,177 --> 00:12:11,044
Hey, taxi!

98
00:12:25,227 --> 00:12:27,195
Feeling better?

99
00:12:27,363 --> 00:12:29,331
Yes, thank you.

100
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:32,262
- You're very kind.
- Don't you fool yourself.

101
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:35,871
I'm not bothering
about you just out of kindness.

102
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,875
- How'd you ever get into this fix?
- Bad luck, I guess.

103
00:12:43,045 --> 00:12:44,740
There are a lot of girls like me.

104
00:12:44,914 --> 00:12:49,544
- Not many with your looks.
- I can get by in good clothes all right.

105
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,710
- But when a girl gets too shabby...
- No family?

106
00:12:52,888 --> 00:12:54,685
Supposed to have an uncle someplace.

107
00:12:55,624 --> 00:12:57,922
Did you ever do any acting?

108
00:12:58,093 --> 00:13:01,119
I used to do extra work now
and then over on Long Island.

109
00:13:01,297 --> 00:13:03,094
The studio's closed now.

110
00:13:03,265 --> 00:13:05,859
- What's your name?
- Ann Darrow.

111
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:08,026
Fine. I've got a job for you.

112
00:13:09,004 --> 00:13:10,562
Costumes on the ship
will fit you.

113
00:13:10,739 --> 00:13:13,367
If the shops are still open,
I can get clothes for you.

114
00:13:13,542 --> 00:13:15,009
- Come on.
- But...

115
00:13:15,177 --> 00:13:18,442
- But what is it?
- It's money and adventure and fame.

116
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:21,139
It's the thrill of a lifetime.
A long sea voyage...

117
00:13:21,317 --> 00:13:23,751
...that starts at
6:oo tomorrow morning.

118
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,682
No, wait.

119
00:13:26,889 --> 00:13:29,016
I don't understand.
You must tell me.

120
00:13:29,191 --> 00:13:32,024
I do want the job so...

121
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,658
...but I can't.
- Oh, I see.

122
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,890
No, you've got me wrong.
This is strictly business.

123
00:13:40,369 --> 00:13:42,894
- I only wanted...
- Sure. Sure you did.

124
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:45,905
I got a little excited and I forgot
you didn't understand.

125
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:51,478
Listen, I'm Carl Denham.
Ever heard of me?

126
00:13:51,647 --> 00:13:55,378
Yes, yes. You make moving pictures
in jungles and places.

127
00:13:55,551 --> 00:13:58,213
That's right. And I pick you
as lead in my next picture.

128
00:13:58,387 --> 00:14:00,582
We sail at 6.

129
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,623
- Where to?
- A long way off.

130
00:14:03,792 --> 00:14:08,354
And listen, Ann, I'm on the level.
No funny business.

131
00:14:09,532 --> 00:14:14,868
- What do I have to do?
- Just trust me and keep your chin up.

132
00:14:31,854 --> 00:14:34,254
Hey, you men on that winch...

133
00:14:34,423 --> 00:14:37,392
...down below on the deck
and help with these hatches.

134
00:14:45,267 --> 00:14:47,929
Hurry this line forward.

135
00:14:48,103 --> 00:14:51,300
Forward, you farmer and up here!

136
00:14:51,473 --> 00:14:53,100
What are you doing up here?

137
00:14:53,275 --> 00:14:56,244
- I just wanted to see.
- Oh, you just wanted to see.

138
00:14:56,412 --> 00:14:59,245
Well, I'm sorry.
Make that line fast!

139
00:14:59,415 --> 00:15:01,508
You're that girl Denham
picked, aren't you?

140
00:15:01,684 --> 00:15:05,552
Yes. I think this is awfully exciting.
I've never been on a ship before.

141
00:15:05,721 --> 00:15:07,848
I've never been on one
with a woman before.

142
00:15:08,691 --> 00:15:11,319
I guess you don't think much
of women on ships?

143
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,620
No, they're a nuisance.

144
00:15:13,796 --> 00:15:16,697
- I'll try not to be.
- You've been in the way already.

145
00:15:16,865 --> 00:15:19,527
Bring that ladder aboard!

146
00:15:20,069 --> 00:15:21,536
Well, you better stay below.

147
00:15:22,004 --> 00:15:24,199
What? The whole voyage?

148
00:15:25,908 --> 00:15:28,240
I'm afraid I didn't apologize
for hitting you.

149
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,810
That was a pretty tough rap
on the chin.

150
00:15:39,555 --> 00:15:42,524
- Well, we're off.
- We're off.

151
00:15:55,838 --> 00:15:59,069
Say, how many potatoes do you think
you've peeled in six weeks?

152
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:00,572
Too many.

153
00:16:00,743 --> 00:16:03,075
Sailors eat an awful lot,
don't they?

154
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:05,736
All time eat.
Someday me go back China.

155
00:16:05,914 --> 00:16:07,211
Never see no more potatoes.

156
00:16:09,451 --> 00:16:12,614
- Charlie, isn't the ocean wonderful?
- Very pretty.

157
00:16:12,788 --> 00:16:15,882
Pretty soon you be all same sailor,
only no eat so much.

158
00:16:16,058 --> 00:16:19,186
I'd like to be. Only, of course,
it wasn't so nice up north...

159
00:16:19,361 --> 00:16:21,591
...when it was cold
and rough was it?

160
00:16:21,764 --> 00:16:26,463
Ocean very nice when you order
weather or some eggs for breakfast.

161
00:16:30,773 --> 00:16:33,037
- Hello, Ann.
- Hello, Jack.

162
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:34,573
Where you been all morning?

163
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,335
Trying on costumes
for Mr. Denham.

164
00:16:36,512 --> 00:16:38,810
He's gonna make some tests of me
here on deck...

165
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:41,677
...if the light is right.
- Tests, why?

166
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:47,351
Oh, to see which side of my face
looks best and all that.

167
00:16:47,523 --> 00:16:50,219
Both sides look all right to me.

168
00:16:50,392 --> 00:16:53,156
Yes, but you're not
the movie director.

169
00:16:53,328 --> 00:16:56,126
If I was, you wouldn't be here.

170
00:16:56,665 --> 00:16:59,691
Well, is that a nice thing to say.

171
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:02,336
This is no place for a girl.

172
00:17:02,504 --> 00:17:06,304
I wish you wouldn't keep harping
on that. It's very mean of you.

173
00:17:06,475 --> 00:17:09,808
Anybody would think
I'd been a lot of trouble.

174
00:17:09,978 --> 00:17:14,745
I haven't. You can't say I've been
one bit of trouble to anyone...

175
00:17:15,150 --> 00:17:16,742
...have I?

176
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:19,479
- Sure you have. Sure you have.
- I don't see...

177
00:17:19,655 --> 00:17:21,589
Well, how?

178
00:17:21,757 --> 00:17:24,157
Just... Just being around is trouble.

179
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:28,223
Oh, dear, and I thought everything
was going so nicely.

180
00:17:28,397 --> 00:17:29,955
Oh, you're all right.

181
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,101
But women just can't help
being a bother.

182
00:17:33,268 --> 00:17:36,237
- Made that way I guess.
- Well, anyhow<i>...</i>

183
00:17:37,306 --> 00:17:41,208
I've had the happiest time
of my life on this old ship.

184
00:17:41,376 --> 00:17:43,310
That's... That's fine.

185
00:17:48,951 --> 00:17:50,316
Say<i>...</i>

186
00:17:50,486 --> 00:17:51,953
Did you really mean that, Ann?

187
00:17:52,121 --> 00:17:56,922
Of course. Everyone's so nice to me.
Dr. Denham and the skipper...

188
00:17:57,092 --> 00:18:00,960
Don't you think the skipper
is a sweet old lamb?

189
00:18:01,396 --> 00:18:03,626
I'd hate to have him
hear me say that.

190
00:18:03,799 --> 00:18:05,494
Iggy's nice to me.

191
00:18:05,667 --> 00:18:09,296
Iggy likes me better than
he likes anybody onboard.

192
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:11,530
Don't you, Iggy?

193
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:17,668
- That's right. Of course you do.
- Beauty and the beast, eh?

194
00:18:17,846 --> 00:18:20,337
Well, now, I never thought
I was good-Iooking.

195
00:18:20,516 --> 00:18:23,713
Put on one of the costumes.
The light's right for those tests now.

196
00:18:23,886 --> 00:18:27,788
All right, Mr. Denham.
I won't be a minute.

197
00:18:27,956 --> 00:18:30,584
Beauty and the beast.

198
00:18:30,759 --> 00:18:32,920
Mr. Denham...

199
00:18:33,095 --> 00:18:34,790
...I'm gonna do some butting in.

200
00:18:34,963 --> 00:18:37,124
- What's your trouble?
- When do we find out...

201
00:18:37,299 --> 00:18:38,960
...where we're going?
- Pretty soon.

202
00:18:39,134 --> 00:18:40,795
Will you tell us
what happens after?

203
00:18:40,969 --> 00:18:43,904
How can I? I'm not a fortuneteller.

204
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:46,097
You must have
some idea what you're after.

205
00:18:46,275 --> 00:18:47,867
What's the matter?
You going soft.

206
00:18:48,043 --> 00:18:51,240
Oh, you know I'm not.
Not for myself.

207
00:18:51,413 --> 00:18:54,211
- For Ann.
- Oh, you have gone soft on her, eh?

208
00:18:54,383 --> 00:18:57,875
I've got enough troubles without
a love affair to complicate things.

209
00:18:58,053 --> 00:19:01,318
- Better cut it out, Jack.
- Love affair.

210
00:19:01,490 --> 00:19:04,391
- Think I'm gonna fall for any dame?
- I never knew it to fail.

211
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:07,620
Some big hard-boiled egg gets
a look at a pretty face, bang...

212
00:19:07,796 --> 00:19:10,026
...he cracks up, gets sappy.
- Who's going sappy?

213
00:19:10,199 --> 00:19:11,598
I haven't run out on you?

214
00:19:11,767 --> 00:19:13,564
No. You're a pretty tough guy.

215
00:19:13,735 --> 00:19:16,329
But if beauty gets you, you...

216
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,000
I'm going right
into a theme song here.

217
00:19:21,476 --> 00:19:25,708
- Say, what are you talking about?
- It's the idea of my picture.

218
00:19:25,881 --> 00:19:27,781
The beast was a tough guy too.

219
00:19:27,950 --> 00:19:32,182
He could lick the world, but when
he saw beauty, she got him.

220
00:19:32,354 --> 00:19:36,256
He went soft, he forgot his wisdom
and the little fellas licked him.

221
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:37,824
Think it over, Jack.

222
00:19:37,993 --> 00:19:40,257
Mr. Denham, skipper
wants you up on the bridge.

223
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,590
- He says we've reached the position.
- Good.

224
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,631
Come on, Jack. You're in on this.
I'm gonna spill it.

225
00:19:47,536 --> 00:19:51,495
There's our noon position.
Two south, 9o east.

226
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,531
Now, you promised some information
when we got here.

227
00:19:54,710 --> 00:19:58,305
- Way west of Sumatra.
- And way out of any waters I know.

228
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,710
I know the East Indies like
I do my own hand...

229
00:20:00,883 --> 00:20:03,579
...but I've never been here.
- Where do we go from here?

230
00:20:03,752 --> 00:20:05,413
- Southwest.
- Southwest?

231
00:20:05,587 --> 00:20:07,953
Well, there is nothing
for thousands of miles.

232
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,183
Keep your shirt on, skipper.
We're not going thousands of miles.

233
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:13,954
Here's the island we're looking for.

234
00:20:15,464 --> 00:20:18,194
Well, that position.
Let's have the big chart.

235
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:20,301
You won't find
that island on any chart.

236
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:23,233
That was made by the skipper
of a Norwegian bark.

237
00:20:23,405 --> 00:20:25,805
- He must have been kidding.
- No, he wasn't.

238
00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:30,274
Listen, a canoe full of natives from
this island was blown to sea.

239
00:20:30,445 --> 00:20:32,777
When the bark picked them,
there was one alive.

240
00:20:32,948 --> 00:20:35,781
He died before they reached port,
not before the skipper...

241
00:20:35,951 --> 00:20:39,387
...had a description of the island
and got an idea of where it lies.

242
00:20:39,554 --> 00:20:41,954
- Where did you get it?
- Singapore, two years ago.

243
00:20:42,124 --> 00:20:43,682
Skipper knew I'd be interested.

244
00:20:43,859 --> 00:20:47,158
- Does he believe it?
- I don't know. But I do.

245
00:20:47,329 --> 00:20:50,765
Here. Here's what
the island looks like.

246
00:20:54,503 --> 00:20:56,368
There's a long, sandy peninsula.

247
00:20:56,538 --> 00:20:59,268
The only possible landing place
is through this reef.

248
00:20:59,441 --> 00:21:02,308
Rest of shoreline's sheer precipice,
hundreds of feet high.

249
00:21:02,477 --> 00:21:05,105
And across the base
of the peninsula, cutting it off...

250
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:07,748
...from the rest
of the island, is a wall.

251
00:21:08,317 --> 00:21:11,548
- A wall?
- Built long ago. People who lived there...

252
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:14,814
...slipped back, forgotten
the high civilization that built it.

253
00:21:14,990 --> 00:21:17,515
That wall is as strong today
as it was centuries ago.

254
00:21:17,693 --> 00:21:20,161
The natives keep that wall in repair.

255
00:21:20,329 --> 00:21:22,320
- They need it.
- Why?

256
00:21:22,497 --> 00:21:25,989
There's something on the other side
of it. Something they fear.

257
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:28,396
A hostile tribe.

258
00:21:35,143 --> 00:21:38,306
Did you ever hear of Kong?

259
00:21:40,449 --> 00:21:42,349
Why, yes.

260
00:21:42,517 --> 00:21:46,283
Some native superstition, isn't it?
A god or a spirit or something.

261
00:21:46,822 --> 00:21:49,382
Well, anyway,
neither beast nor man...

262
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:52,584
...something monstrous,
all-powerful.

263
00:21:52,995 --> 00:21:54,326
Still living...

264
00:21:54,496 --> 00:21:58,023
...still holding that island
in a grip of deadly fear.

265
00:22:01,336 --> 00:22:03,566
Well, every legend
has a basis of truth.

266
00:22:03,739 --> 00:22:07,607
I tell you, there's something on that
island that no white man has ever seen.

267
00:22:07,776 --> 00:22:11,906
- And you expect to photograph it?
- Lf it's there, you bet I'll photograph it.

268
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:15,442
Suppose it doesn't like
having its picture taken?

269
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:21,785
Well, now you know why I brought
along those cases of gas bombs.

270
00:22:28,630 --> 00:22:31,861
Oh, you've put on a beauty-and-beast
costume, eh?

271
00:22:32,034 --> 00:22:33,968
It's the prettiest.

272
00:22:34,136 --> 00:22:37,128
All right. Just stand right over there.

273
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:41,876
I'm sort of nervous.
Suppose I don't photograph well?

274
00:22:42,044 --> 00:22:45,104
You don't have to worry about that.
If I hadn't been sure...

275
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,942
...I wouldn't have brought you
around the world.

276
00:22:48,216 --> 00:22:51,549
- What will I do?
- Well, we start with the profile.

277
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,381
When I start cranking...

278
00:22:53,555 --> 00:22:56,490
...why, hold it a minute, and
then turn slowly toward me.

279
00:22:56,658 --> 00:23:00,219
You see me.
You smile a little, then you listen.

280
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,125
Then you laugh. All right.

281
00:23:03,298 --> 00:23:04,822
Camera.

282
00:23:15,043 --> 00:23:17,773
- Looks kind of silly, don't it?
- Pretty dame, huh?

283
00:23:17,946 --> 00:23:20,039
You think maybe
he like to take my picture?

284
00:23:20,215 --> 00:23:23,514
Them cameras cost money.
Shouldn't think he'd risk it.

285
00:23:25,454 --> 00:23:28,446
Now, that's fine, Ann.
Now we'll try one with a filter, eh?

286
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:31,025
Do you always take
the pictures yourself?

287
00:23:31,693 --> 00:23:33,627
Ever since a trip I made to Africa.

288
00:23:33,795 --> 00:23:36,389
I'd have got a swell picture
of a charging rhino...

289
00:23:36,565 --> 00:23:38,089
...but the cameraman got scared.

290
00:23:38,266 --> 00:23:40,894
The darned fool.
I was right there with a rifle.

291
00:23:41,069 --> 00:23:44,038
Seems he didn't trust me to get
the rhino before it got him.

292
00:23:44,206 --> 00:23:47,642
I haven't fooled with a
cameramen since. I do it myself.

293
00:23:47,809 --> 00:23:50,778
- Think he's crazy, skipper?
- Just enthusiastic.

294
00:23:51,146 --> 00:23:52,977
Ann, in this one
you're looking down.

295
00:23:53,148 --> 00:23:56,117
When I start to crank,
you look up slowly.

296
00:23:56,284 --> 00:23:59,185
You're quite calm.
You don't expect to see a thing.

297
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:02,812
Then you just follow
my directions. All right?

298
00:24:04,092 --> 00:24:07,619
Camera. Look up slowly, Ann.

299
00:24:07,796 --> 00:24:10,959
That's it. You don't see anything.

300
00:24:11,133 --> 00:24:13,294
Now look higher...

301
00:24:13,468 --> 00:24:15,936
...still higher.

302
00:24:16,104 --> 00:24:19,665
Now you see it. You're amazed.

303
00:24:19,841 --> 00:24:23,777
You can't believe it.
Your eyes open wider.

304
00:24:23,945 --> 00:24:26,470
It's horrible, Ann,
but you can't look away.

305
00:24:26,648 --> 00:24:28,912
There's no chance for you, Ann,
no escape.

306
00:24:29,084 --> 00:24:31,018
You're helpless, Ann, helpless.

307
00:24:31,186 --> 00:24:33,882
There's just one chance,
if you can scream...

308
00:24:34,055 --> 00:24:37,923
...but your throat's paralyzed.
Try to scream, Ann, try.

309
00:24:38,093 --> 00:24:40,391
Perhaps if you didn't see it,
you could scream.

310
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:44,965
Throw your arm across your eyes
and scream. Scream for your life.

311
00:24:48,470 --> 00:24:51,234
What's he think
she's really gonna see?

312
00:25:06,721 --> 00:25:10,350
This infernal fog.
Sure of your position, skipper?

313
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,323
Last night before this fog shut down,
I got a good sight.

314
00:25:13,495 --> 00:25:15,258
We should be near the island.

315
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:18,225
If we don't see it when this fog lifts,
we never will.

316
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:19,833
We've quartered these parts.

317
00:25:20,335 --> 00:25:21,996
Can't see your hand in front of your face.

318
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:25,105
Hey, Charlie, I wish you'd make
your soup as thick as this.

319
00:25:28,843 --> 00:25:31,835
No bottom at 3o.

320
00:25:32,013 --> 00:25:35,107
The Norwegian skipper must've
been guessing at the position.

321
00:25:35,283 --> 00:25:36,910
How will we know
it's the right island?

322
00:25:37,085 --> 00:25:41,351
- The mountain that looks like a skull.
- Oh, yes, I'd forgotten. You told me.

323
00:25:41,523 --> 00:25:44,651
- Skull Mountain.
- By the deep 2o.

324
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:47,158
Shallowing fast.
Mr. Briggs, dead slow.

325
00:25:47,329 --> 00:25:49,263
Dead slow, sir.

326
00:25:49,431 --> 00:25:53,128
- Confound this fog.
- By the deep 16.

327
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:56,236
- What'd she draw, skipper?
- Four.

328
00:25:56,404 --> 00:25:58,565
Why don't he
heave to until it clears?

329
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:02,403
'Tain't the old man.
It's that crazy guy, Denham.

330
00:26:02,677 --> 00:26:05,578
Listen, you hear anything?

331
00:26:05,747 --> 00:26:07,612
No.

332
00:26:07,782 --> 00:26:12,185
- Breakers ahead.
- Let go.

333
00:26:17,592 --> 00:26:21,392
That's not breakers. That's drums.

334
00:26:39,714 --> 00:26:42,182
Skipper, now the fog's lifted,
do you see anybody?

335
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:45,342
- Not a living thing.
- Funny they haven't spotted us.

336
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:49,053
I'd think the whole population
would be on the beach.

337
00:26:49,224 --> 00:26:50,851
Listen.

338
00:26:55,397 --> 00:26:58,798
Maybe they have spotted us
and are signaling.

339
00:26:58,967 --> 00:27:02,027
Well, skipper, do you believe me now?
There it is.

340
00:27:02,437 --> 00:27:04,029
Skull Mountain, the wall.

341
00:27:04,205 --> 00:27:06,366
Everything just like
on my funny little map.

342
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,009
- Come on. Let's get started.
- All right.

343
00:27:09,177 --> 00:27:11,407
Twelve men go with you.
The rest stay aboard.

344
00:27:11,579 --> 00:27:14,707
Have you got a good man
with those gas bombs?

345
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:16,441
I think you better go along.

346
00:27:16,618 --> 00:27:18,677
You may be able to talk
to these birds.

347
00:27:18,853 --> 00:27:20,343
All right. Mr. Adams.

348
00:27:20,522 --> 00:27:22,251
Aye, sir.

349
00:27:22,691 --> 00:27:24,921
- You'll take charge of the ship.
- Aye, aye, sir.

350
00:27:25,093 --> 00:27:28,221
- I'm going ashore with you, aren't I?
- You bet.

351
00:27:28,396 --> 00:27:30,796
I don't think she should
until we know what's there.

352
00:27:30,965 --> 00:27:32,762
Wait a minute.
Who's running this show?

353
00:27:32,934 --> 00:27:36,097
I found out from experience to
keep my cast and cameras with me.

354
00:27:36,604 --> 00:27:38,231
You never can tell
when you'll want them.

355
00:27:38,406 --> 00:27:40,067
- But you're crazy to risk...
- Jack...

356
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:42,675
...run along and get
the rifles and ammunition.

357
00:27:42,844 --> 00:27:45,312
And get me a couple of huskies
to carry my stuff.

358
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,573
And, Jack, don't forget
the costume box.

359
00:27:47,749 --> 00:27:51,150
If we're lucky enough,
we may get a swell shot right away.

360
00:27:51,319 --> 00:27:52,877
Come on, Ann.

361
00:27:56,291 --> 00:27:58,486
All right, boys, let's go.

362
00:27:58,660 --> 00:28:00,924
- Take it easy with that camera.
- Okay.

363
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:03,496
- Plenty of ammunition for those guns?
- Yes, sir.

364
00:28:03,665 --> 00:28:05,633
Be careful with those bombs.

365
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:08,667
All right, Briggs, now we'll get
a look at Denham's island.

366
00:28:10,205 --> 00:28:12,730
Stand by to lower away.

367
00:28:46,207 --> 00:28:47,834
You with the camera,
stick close.

368
00:28:48,009 --> 00:28:49,533
- Okay.
- Who's got the bombs?

369
00:28:49,711 --> 00:28:51,178
- I have, sir.
- Watch your step.

370
00:28:51,346 --> 00:28:53,940
There's enough trichloride
to put hippos to sleep.

371
00:28:54,115 --> 00:28:55,673
Aye, aye, sir.

372
00:28:55,850 --> 00:28:59,650
- What queer-Iooking boats.
- Yeah, outrigger canoes.

373
00:29:00,021 --> 00:29:02,717
Driscoll, I want two men left here
to guard the boat.

374
00:29:02,891 --> 00:29:04,722
- All attended to, sir.
- Good.

375
00:29:04,893 --> 00:29:07,987
We all ready, then?
Come on.

376
00:29:17,772 --> 00:29:19,501
Not a soul in sight.

377
00:29:19,674 --> 00:29:21,574
The people must all
be gathered up ahead.

378
00:29:21,743 --> 00:29:23,836
That wall, skipper.
What do you think of that?

379
00:29:24,012 --> 00:29:26,640
Colossal.
It might almost be Egyptian.

380
00:29:26,815 --> 00:29:29,579
But what's on the other side
of that wall? I wanna know.

381
00:29:29,751 --> 00:29:32,185
Who do you suppose
could have built it?

382
00:29:32,353 --> 00:29:34,378
Oh, I was up on Angkor once.

383
00:29:34,556 --> 00:29:37,491
That's bigger than this,
and nobody knows who built it.

384
00:29:37,659 --> 00:29:41,220
Oh, boy, what a chance.
What a picture.

385
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,968
Come on.

386
00:29:56,110 --> 00:29:59,204
Hear that?
They're saying, "Kong, Kong."

387
00:29:59,380 --> 00:30:01,143
Hope you talk
their lingo, skipper.

388
00:30:01,316 --> 00:30:03,716
- You catch any words yet?
- I'm not sure.

389
00:30:03,885 --> 00:30:06,786
Sounds something like the language
Nias Islanders speak.

390
00:30:06,955 --> 00:30:08,513
What do you suppose is happening?

391
00:30:08,690 --> 00:30:10,783
They're up to some
of their heathen tricks.

392
00:30:10,959 --> 00:30:12,586
But don't go rushing out to sea.

393
00:30:12,760 --> 00:30:15,524
- All right. But isn't it exciting?
- Sure.

394
00:30:15,697 --> 00:30:19,292
- I wish we'd left you on the ship.
- Oh, I'm so glad you didn't.

395
00:30:19,467 --> 00:30:22,994
Wait. Easy, now.
Wait till I see what goes on.

396
00:30:35,383 --> 00:30:37,851
Holy mackerel! What a show.

397
00:30:38,019 --> 00:30:41,682
Hey, skipper, come here
and get a load of this.

398
00:30:43,324 --> 00:30:46,191
Did you ever see anything
like that before in your life?

399
00:31:31,739 --> 00:31:34,401
Boy, if I could only get
a picture before they see us.

400
00:31:34,576 --> 00:31:37,272
Hey, you with the camera.
Come here.

401
00:31:38,413 --> 00:31:40,244
I wanna see.

402
00:31:40,415 --> 00:31:43,179
Come on, but be careful.

403
00:32:06,474 --> 00:32:08,669
- Too late. They see us.
- Let's... Let's beat it.

404
00:32:08,843 --> 00:32:12,040
- Hey, what are you running for?
- No use trying to hide now.

405
00:32:12,213 --> 00:32:14,681
Everybody come out in plain sight.

406
00:32:49,684 --> 00:32:53,415
- Say, let's scram out of here.
- Stand still, you fool.

407
00:32:53,588 --> 00:32:56,284
Steady, boys, bluff them.

408
00:33:07,268 --> 00:33:10,431
Come on, skipper.
Make him a friendly speech.

409
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:31,190
He understands you, skipper.
What's he say?

410
00:33:31,359 --> 00:33:34,351
- He's telling us to get out.
- Well, talk him out of it.

411
00:33:34,529 --> 00:33:36,690
Ask him what goes on.

412
00:33:48,943 --> 00:33:51,138
He says the girl there
is the bride of Kong.

413
00:33:51,312 --> 00:33:53,974
Great. Find out
what they're gonna do.

414
00:34:05,593 --> 00:34:08,323
- What's that?
- He must be the witch doctor.

415
00:34:08,496 --> 00:34:11,158
He says the ceremony is spoiled
because we've seen it.

416
00:34:11,332 --> 00:34:14,324
Well, calm the old boy down.
What's the word for friend?

417
00:34:25,379 --> 00:34:28,007
Steady with those rifles, boys.

418
00:34:34,555 --> 00:34:38,389
- What's that?
- He says, look at the golden woman.

419
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:40,789
Yeah. Blonds are scarce
around here.

420
00:34:49,203 --> 00:34:52,661
- A gift for Kong, he says.
- Good Lord!

421
00:34:56,577 --> 00:34:58,545
Wants to buy her.

422
00:35:04,485 --> 00:35:07,420
He's offering to trade
six of his women for Ann.

423
00:35:09,090 --> 00:35:11,149
You got her into this, Denham.

424
00:35:21,969 --> 00:35:23,698
I'm gonna take her
back to the ship.

425
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:26,772
We'd better get out of here
before they think to cut us off.

426
00:35:26,941 --> 00:35:29,910
Guess so. But tell him we'll be back
tomorrow to make friends.

427
00:35:35,817 --> 00:35:40,254
Get going, Ann. Don't be scared.
Everything's all right.

428
00:35:41,289 --> 00:35:43,723
Smile, Ann, and talk to Jack.

429
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,620
Keep your chin up.

430
00:36:09,173 --> 00:36:13,837
- Say, why aren't you in bed?
- Oh, I can't sleep.

431
00:36:14,011 --> 00:36:17,742
The sound of those drums
makes me nervous, I guess.

432
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:20,884
I think Denham's off his nut
taking you ashore today.

433
00:36:21,051 --> 00:36:22,450
Well, I was a little scared.

434
00:36:23,888 --> 00:36:28,154
- I guess you weren't the only one.
- I wonder what we do next.

435
00:36:28,325 --> 00:36:29,917
That's just what's worrying me.

436
00:36:30,094 --> 00:36:32,790
Denham's a fool,
there's no telling what he might...

437
00:36:32,963 --> 00:36:34,726
...ask you to do for this picture.

438
00:36:34,899 --> 00:36:37,424
After all he's done,
I would take any chance for him.

439
00:36:37,601 --> 00:36:39,228
Don't talk like that.

440
00:36:39,403 --> 00:36:41,769
I'd say he's crazy enough
to try anything.

441
00:36:41,939 --> 00:36:44,464
Well, I won't go back on him.

442
00:36:44,642 --> 00:36:49,011
When I think of what might've happened
today, if anything had happened to you...

443
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:51,978
Then you wouldn't be bothered
having a woman onboard.

444
00:36:52,149 --> 00:36:55,846
Don't laugh. I'm scared for you.

445
00:36:56,020 --> 00:37:00,047
I'm sort of...
Well, I'm scared of you too.

446
00:37:00,224 --> 00:37:01,782
Ann<i>...</i>

447
00:37:02,793 --> 00:37:04,124
I<i>...</i>

448
00:37:07,865 --> 00:37:09,765
Say<i>...</i>

449
00:37:09,934 --> 00:37:12,869
I guess I love you.

450
00:37:13,037 --> 00:37:16,131
Why, Jack, you hate women.

451
00:37:16,841 --> 00:37:19,776
Yeah, I know.
But you aren't women.

452
00:37:21,645 --> 00:37:23,510
Say, Ann<i>...</i>

453
00:37:23,681 --> 00:37:26,206
I don't suppose...

454
00:37:26,383 --> 00:37:28,317
I mean<i>...</i>

455
00:37:28,486 --> 00:37:32,547
Well, you don't feel anything
like that about me...

456
00:37:33,224 --> 00:37:35,021
...do you?

457
00:37:42,333 --> 00:37:44,733
Mr. Driscoll, are you on deck?

458
00:37:46,904 --> 00:37:48,769
Yes, sir.

459
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:51,966
Will you please
come up on the bridge?

460
00:37:54,478 --> 00:37:56,639
You go on. I'll wait here.

461
00:38:00,784 --> 00:38:02,411
Yes, sir.

462
00:39:18,862 --> 00:39:20,523
There, that's about it.

463
00:39:20,698 --> 00:39:23,064
We'll make absolutely sure
tomorrow noon.

464
00:39:23,233 --> 00:39:26,202
Oh, must be almost midnight.

465
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:28,361
Hey.

466
00:39:28,539 --> 00:39:30,268
Look at that.

467
00:39:30,441 --> 00:39:32,636
Torches going through the village.

468
00:39:33,010 --> 00:39:36,446
Yeah, looks like the night
before election.

469
00:39:36,614 --> 00:39:39,174
Listen to them. Wonder what's up.

470
00:39:41,619 --> 00:39:43,519
Wish I could take pictures
by firelight.

471
00:39:43,687 --> 00:39:46,520
- I'd sneak ashore and get a scene now.
- Oh, be sensible.

472
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:48,851
We're lucky to be all safe
aboard tonight.

473
00:39:49,026 --> 00:39:51,051
Yeah, I guess so.

474
00:39:58,268 --> 00:40:01,396
- Charlie, have you seen missy?
- Me no see one, two hours.

475
00:40:01,572 --> 00:40:04,735
When we leave this place?
Me no like.

476
00:40:12,950 --> 00:40:14,747
Ann.

477
00:40:14,918 --> 00:40:16,749
Ann.

478
00:40:33,037 --> 00:40:35,028
All hands on deck!
Everybody on deck!

479
00:40:35,205 --> 00:40:37,435
Everybody on deck!
All hands on deck!

480
00:40:37,608 --> 00:40:40,509
Everybody on deck!
Everybody on deck!

481
00:40:40,678 --> 00:40:43,306
- What's the matter? What's happening?
- What's going on?

482
00:40:44,815 --> 00:40:46,874
- What's the matter?
- I'm out here.

483
00:40:54,992 --> 00:40:56,482
Look, sir. Me find on deck.

484
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:59,458
- A native bracelet.
- Crazy black man been here.

485
00:40:59,963 --> 00:41:01,396
What is it?
Who turned out the crew?

486
00:41:01,565 --> 00:41:03,590
- Look. Someone's been aboard.
- Where's Ann?

487
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,702
- In her cabin.
- No, she isn't. I just looked.

488
00:41:07,004 --> 00:41:10,405
- What's the matter, Mr. Driscoll?
- Search the ship. Find Miss Darrow.

489
00:41:10,574 --> 00:41:13,407
Aye, aye.

490
00:41:13,577 --> 00:41:17,206
- Ann. Oh, Ann. Did you see her?
- No.

491
00:41:17,381 --> 00:41:19,246
I'll look below.

492
00:41:24,288 --> 00:41:26,381
- Did you find her?
- Can't find her forward.

493
00:41:26,557 --> 00:41:28,855
- She's not below.
- Can't find her aft.

494
00:41:29,026 --> 00:41:30,254
Ann's gone!

495
00:41:31,361 --> 00:41:34,194
Serve out the rifles. Man the boats.

496
00:41:35,532 --> 00:41:37,762
Take this ammunition outside.

497
00:41:37,935 --> 00:41:39,698
Come on, you fellas.
Grab these guns.

498
00:41:39,870 --> 00:41:42,634
Take these bomb cases
and be careful with them.

499
00:41:42,906 --> 00:41:45,136
Pass those rifles up over the side.

500
00:41:47,778 --> 00:41:49,712
Start packing those bombs.

501
00:41:50,380 --> 00:41:52,314
Me likey go too.
Me likey catch missy.

502
00:41:52,483 --> 00:41:55,509
This is no job for a cook.
Get out of here. Come on.

503
00:41:56,286 --> 00:41:58,379
Shove her off, men.
We're going over the side.

504
00:41:59,056 --> 00:42:01,422
Give way, gentlemen.
Right over there.

505
00:42:01,592 --> 00:42:03,150
They've taken Ann.

506
00:48:11,194 --> 00:48:15,028
Hurry. Hurry up.
She must be up ahead here.

507
00:48:15,198 --> 00:48:16,790
- Come on, men.
- Come on, boys.

508
00:48:16,967 --> 00:48:18,559
Has anybody seen her?
Come on.

509
00:48:44,961 --> 00:48:46,223
Get this gate open. Quick!

510
00:48:46,897 --> 00:48:49,627
Get up there, men.
Pull that thing back!

511
00:48:49,799 --> 00:48:52,097
Pull that bar back.
He's got Ann.

512
00:48:52,269 --> 00:48:54,999
Heave. Heave.

513
00:48:56,139 --> 00:48:58,505
Heave. Heave.

514
00:48:58,675 --> 00:49:00,506
- Who's going with me?
- I'll go.

515
00:49:07,284 --> 00:49:09,582
You stay with half the men
and guard the gate.

516
00:49:09,753 --> 00:49:12,278
- Don't let them close it.
- We'll take care of it.

517
00:49:55,332 --> 00:49:57,960
No telling which way
he went in this darkness.

518
00:49:58,134 --> 00:49:59,499
He's been through here.

519
00:49:59,669 --> 00:50:03,105
- Look at these broken branches.
- Yeah, look at that. Keep up, fellas.

520
00:50:04,841 --> 00:50:06,741
It ought to be sunup about now.

521
00:50:06,910 --> 00:50:10,004
Yeah, just listen to those birds.

522
00:50:10,180 --> 00:50:12,478
It's dawn all right.

523
00:50:12,649 --> 00:50:15,948
- What's that?
- Holy mackerel!

524
00:50:16,119 --> 00:50:18,849
Yeah, that's his track.
Look at the size of that thing.

525
00:50:19,022 --> 00:50:20,546
He must be as big as a house.

526
00:50:20,724 --> 00:50:22,089
He's headed this way.

527
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:24,659
Come on, fellas, and keep
those guns cocked.

528
00:50:24,828 --> 00:50:26,796
Hate to have that thing
wrapped around me.

529
00:50:35,572 --> 00:50:37,767
Here's another one.
We're on his trail.

530
00:50:37,941 --> 00:50:41,172
Sure, sure. I know that.
Come on. Come on, fellas.

531
00:50:45,582 --> 00:50:47,345
Hey, look at that!

532
00:50:48,451 --> 00:50:50,942
Keep quiet.
He doesn't see us.

533
00:50:57,727 --> 00:50:59,922
Give me one of those bombs.

534
00:51:12,942 --> 00:51:15,069
Look, it's gonna charge.

535
00:51:22,786 --> 00:51:24,720
Keep quiet.

536
00:51:28,992 --> 00:51:30,550
Come on.

537
00:51:49,145 --> 00:51:50,942
Give him another one.

538
00:51:54,484 --> 00:51:55,815
Look out!

539
00:52:16,039 --> 00:52:18,599
Look out. He's still alive.

540
00:52:18,775 --> 00:52:20,470
Shoot.

541
00:52:26,883 --> 00:52:28,908
Come on. That got him.

542
00:52:35,258 --> 00:52:36,816
What do you call this thing?

543
00:52:36,993 --> 00:52:39,655
Why, something
from the dinosaur family.

544
00:52:39,829 --> 00:52:41,626
Dinosaur, eh?

545
00:52:41,798 --> 00:52:43,322
Yes, Jack...

546
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:46,060
...a prehistoric beast.

547
00:52:49,406 --> 00:52:52,864
Say, just look at the length
of that brute.

548
00:52:54,744 --> 00:52:58,043
If I could only bring back
one of these alive.

549
00:52:58,214 --> 00:53:01,809
- Watch that tail! He's still alive.
- Come on, looks like he's standing up.

550
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:04,146
He's through. Come on.

551
00:53:04,320 --> 00:53:07,153
Come on, men.

552
00:53:09,526 --> 00:53:11,619
Boy, one swipe of that.

553
00:53:27,110 --> 00:53:28,668
- Hear that?
- Yeah. What is it?

554
00:53:28,845 --> 00:53:31,006
That's him, boys. Come on.

555
00:53:44,127 --> 00:53:46,925
Here. Here's his mark again.

556
00:53:47,530 --> 00:53:50,522
- There's water ahead.
- He's down in that fog somewhere.

557
00:53:52,168 --> 00:53:54,227
Yes, that's him splashing through.
Come on.

558
00:53:54,404 --> 00:53:55,701
Be careful.

559
00:54:02,345 --> 00:54:05,906
Now, watch the step-off, boys.

560
00:54:06,082 --> 00:54:07,413
Must have swum across.

561
00:54:07,584 --> 00:54:10,747
Yeah, it'll be tough for us
with these guns and bombs.

562
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:13,411
- What about these logs for a raft?
- Good idea.

563
00:54:13,590 --> 00:54:14,921
Come, fellas. Get busy.

564
00:54:15,091 --> 00:54:18,254
Put those guns down
on the bank and get going.

565
00:54:20,029 --> 00:54:21,462
Move!

566
00:54:21,631 --> 00:54:23,428
Come on with those poles.

567
00:54:23,600 --> 00:54:25,727
All set, everybody?

568
00:54:26,736 --> 00:54:28,431
Shove off!

569
00:54:51,060 --> 00:54:54,621
- Hear anything?
- No, he's miles away by now.

570
00:54:54,797 --> 00:54:57,823
We'll be able to pick up
his trail all right.

571
00:55:10,480 --> 00:55:11,879
Listen.

572
00:55:25,528 --> 00:55:27,189
Quiet.

573
00:55:30,433 --> 00:55:32,196
What was it?

574
00:55:44,681 --> 00:55:46,546
Hang on, men.

575
00:55:55,658 --> 00:55:58,149
Look out. Here he comes.

576
00:57:14,971 --> 00:57:16,734
Come on.

577
00:58:52,335 --> 00:58:54,235
Come on.

578
01:05:50,186 --> 01:05:53,417
Hey, Jack. Jack Driscoll.

579
01:05:53,589 --> 01:05:56,023
- Hey, Jack.
- Denham.

580
01:05:56,192 --> 01:05:58,990
- It didn't get you, huh?
- No, I got to cover, same as you.

581
01:05:59,161 --> 01:06:01,095
- Think we're safe?
- There are two of us...

582
01:06:01,263 --> 01:06:04,232
...left alive to save her.
- I can't get across now.

583
01:06:04,400 --> 01:06:06,664
Don't want you to.
Lam back and get more bombs.

584
01:06:07,102 --> 01:06:09,593
Why, you wouldn't follow
that beast alone.

585
01:06:09,772 --> 01:06:11,899
Someone's gotta stay on his trail.

586
01:06:12,074 --> 01:06:13,666
I'll get a chance,
sneak her away.

587
01:06:13,842 --> 01:06:16,538
I'll figure a way to signal you
where he's taken her.

588
01:06:16,779 --> 01:06:20,340
- I guess that's our only out.
- Sure it is. Get going.

589
01:06:20,516 --> 01:06:22,711
Don't get killed
till you see Englehorn.

590
01:06:22,885 --> 01:06:24,512
Okay, Jack. Good luck.

591
01:07:55,244 --> 01:07:57,735
Skipper, this Kong
is the biggest thing in the world.

592
01:07:57,913 --> 01:08:00,381
He shook those men off that log
like they were flies.

593
01:08:00,549 --> 01:08:04,246
All those men lost.
It's incredible.

594
01:08:04,420 --> 01:08:06,945
Driscoll said he'd try and signal us
if he found Ann.

595
01:08:07,122 --> 01:08:09,556
- We'll never see them again.
- Don't give up.

596
01:08:09,725 --> 01:08:12,159
- There's chance for Driscoll.
- Wait for daylight.

597
01:08:12,328 --> 01:08:14,796
We'll bridge the ravine.
Where's that case of bombs?

598
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:16,590
- Here, sir.
- This...

599
01:08:16,765 --> 01:08:20,201
This monster you've seen,
you think your bombs will stop him?

600
01:08:20,369 --> 01:08:23,634
If we can get close enough
to use them, you bet they'll stop him.

601
01:08:23,806 --> 01:08:26,536
- Had any trouble with the natives?
- Yes, after you left.

602
01:08:26,709 --> 01:08:28,677
- What happened?
- We fired volleys over...

603
01:08:28,844 --> 01:08:30,903
...their heads,
they ran like rabbits.

604
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,604
Gunpowder's new
in their lives?

605
01:08:32,781 --> 01:08:34,806
- They're terrified.
- They haven't shown up.

606
01:08:34,983 --> 01:08:37,281
Take a man on the wall,
keep your eyes peeled.

607
01:08:37,453 --> 01:08:39,580
We leave at dawn,
if we get a signal or not.

608
01:08:39,755 --> 01:08:41,052
Yes, sir.

609
01:17:44,165 --> 01:17:45,928
Hey, look.

610
01:17:51,373 --> 01:17:54,240
Hey, below, Mr. Denham.
Captain Englehorn.

611
01:17:54,409 --> 01:17:57,003
Mr. Driscoll and the lady,
they're coming back.

612
01:17:57,178 --> 01:17:59,408
Come on, fellas.

613
01:18:03,818 --> 01:18:05,410
Are you both all right?

614
01:18:05,587 --> 01:18:07,020
Pint, Jack. Here.

615
01:18:11,526 --> 01:18:13,687
I'm all right.

616
01:18:13,862 --> 01:18:15,853
What happened? How did you do it?

617
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:18,056
- Came down the river.
- Oh, Jack.

618
01:18:18,400 --> 01:18:20,800
There, there, you're safe now.

619
01:18:20,969 --> 01:18:23,665
We'll have you back on the ship
in no time.

620
01:18:27,375 --> 01:18:29,240
Wait a minute. What about Kong?

621
01:18:29,411 --> 01:18:31,345
Well, what about him?

622
01:18:33,214 --> 01:18:35,910
We came to get a movie,
and we found something worth...

623
01:18:36,084 --> 01:18:38,416
...more than all the movies in the world.
- What?

624
01:18:38,720 --> 01:18:40,119
We've got those gas bombs.

625
01:18:40,288 --> 01:18:43,416
- Lf we can capture him alive...
- Why, you're crazy.

626
01:18:43,591 --> 01:18:45,616
He's on a cliff
where a whole army...

627
01:18:45,794 --> 01:18:49,093
...couldn't get at him.
- Yeah, if he stays there...

628
01:18:49,264 --> 01:18:52,097
...but we've got
something he wants.

629
01:18:52,267 --> 01:18:55,202
Yeah, something
he won't get again.

630
01:18:55,603 --> 01:18:58,697
Hey, look out. It's Kong.
Kong's coming.

631
01:19:23,732 --> 01:19:26,496
Come around. Come here
and hold the gates. Quick.

632
01:19:26,668 --> 01:19:30,160
- Denham, natives are coming.
- Good work. Come on.

633
01:21:21,015 --> 01:21:23,381
Hey, come back
with those bombs, you...

634
01:24:05,480 --> 01:24:08,643
Come on. Come on. I got him.

635
01:24:10,318 --> 01:24:12,218
He'll be out for hours.
Send to the ship.

636
01:24:12,487 --> 01:24:14,853
- For anchor chains and tools.
- What will you do?

637
01:24:15,023 --> 01:24:18,515
A raft to float him to the ship.
The whole world will pay to see this.

638
01:24:18,693 --> 01:24:21,685
- No chains will hold that.
- We'll give him more than chains.

639
01:24:21,863 --> 01:24:25,026
He's always been king of his world,
but we'll teach him fear.

640
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:28,066
We're millionaires, boys.
I'll share it with all of you.

641
01:24:28,236 --> 01:24:30,864
In a few months,
it'll be up in lights on Broadway:

642
01:24:31,039 --> 01:24:34,998
"Kong, the Eighth Wonder
of the World."

643
01:24:53,561 --> 01:24:55,119
Say, what's Denham got anyway?

644
01:24:55,296 --> 01:24:57,890
It better be good
after all this ballyhoo.

645
01:24:58,066 --> 01:25:00,193
Heavens, what a mob.

646
01:25:00,368 --> 01:25:04,236
Well, you would come.
These tickets cost me 2o bucks.

647
01:25:13,448 --> 01:25:16,815
I can't sit so near the screen.
It hurts my eyes.

648
01:25:16,984 --> 01:25:18,679
This is not a moving picture,
madam.

649
01:25:18,953 --> 01:25:21,444
What? Mr. Denham
makes those pictures...

650
01:25:21,622 --> 01:25:24,989
...of those darling monkeys
and tigers and things.

651
01:25:25,159 --> 01:25:27,593
This is in the nature
of a personal appearance.

652
01:25:27,762 --> 01:25:31,220
Well, I never. I thought
I was gonna see something.

653
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:34,863
- Say, what is it anyhow?
- I hear it's a kind of a gorilla.

654
01:25:35,036 --> 01:25:37,834
Gee, ain't we got enough
of them in New York?

655
01:25:43,644 --> 01:25:45,111
I don't like to look at him.

656
01:25:45,279 --> 01:25:47,839
It makes me think
of that awful day on the island.

657
01:25:48,216 --> 01:25:51,549
I wouldn't have brought you,
but you know how Denham insisted.

658
01:25:51,719 --> 01:25:54,244
We had to come
when he said it would help the show.

659
01:25:54,422 --> 01:25:56,481
Do you think we'll
make a lot of money?

660
01:25:56,657 --> 01:25:59,683
Well, enough to pay him back
for these clothes anyway.

661
01:25:59,861 --> 01:26:03,353
It's the first time I ever had on
one of these open-front suits.

662
01:26:03,531 --> 01:26:06,364
Hello, there. Just in time.
Gee, Ann, you look great.

663
01:26:06,534 --> 01:26:11,130
I'm glad I dressed you up for this show.
Well, Jack, $ 1 o, ooo in the box office.

664
01:26:11,305 --> 01:26:13,705
- Not bad for one night.
- That's a lot of money.

665
01:26:13,875 --> 01:26:15,570
We're gonna do that every night.

666
01:26:16,177 --> 01:26:19,340
- Look at the size of that.
- I hope he's tied up tight.

667
01:26:19,514 --> 01:26:21,880
Sure he is.
Denham's taking no chances.

668
01:26:22,049 --> 01:26:23,983
Here are the press.
Come in, boys.

669
01:26:24,152 --> 01:26:26,643
- This is Ms. Darrow and Mr. Driscoll.
- How do you do?

670
01:26:26,821 --> 01:26:28,755
Mr. Driscoll saved you from the ape?

671
01:26:28,923 --> 01:26:32,484
Yes. He was alone too.
All the sailors with him had been killed.

672
01:26:32,660 --> 01:26:36,255
- How did you ever tackle that baby?
- Well, Mr. Denham got him.

673
01:26:36,431 --> 01:26:38,524
The rest of us
were running scared.

674
01:26:38,699 --> 01:26:40,997
He had the nerve
to stand there and chuck bombs.

675
01:26:41,169 --> 01:26:43,660
Oh, so you're the hero.
Come on, give us a story.

676
01:26:43,838 --> 01:26:46,136
Here now, wait a minute.
Lay off me, boys.

677
01:26:46,307 --> 01:26:48,901
Miss Darrow is the story.
If it hadn't been for her...

678
01:26:49,076 --> 01:26:51,943
...we couldn't have gotten near Kong.
He followed her.

679
01:26:52,113 --> 01:26:54,274
- Beauty and the beast, huh?
- That's it.

680
01:26:54,449 --> 01:26:56,644
Play up that angle,
beauty and the beast.

681
01:26:56,818 --> 01:26:58,615
Kong could have stayed safe...

682
01:26:58,786 --> 01:27:00,777
...but he couldn't stay away
from beauty.

683
01:27:00,955 --> 01:27:03,719
- That's your story, boys.
- That's a lead story, all right.

684
01:27:03,891 --> 01:27:05,859
- How about some pictures?
- Just a minute.

685
01:27:06,027 --> 01:27:08,860
Come on the stage. Take pictures
in front of the audience.

686
01:27:09,030 --> 01:27:11,555
I'll make a speech and tell them
about Kong, Darrow...

687
01:27:11,732 --> 01:27:14,326
...Driscoll. When I call you,
come take pictures.

688
01:27:14,502 --> 01:27:16,094
- Okay.
- That's fine.

689
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:17,862
Stand by, Ann, when I call you.

690
01:27:18,039 --> 01:27:19,506
Now, now, it's all right.

691
01:27:19,674 --> 01:27:22,768
We've knocked some of the fight
out of him since you saw him.

692
01:27:38,793 --> 01:27:43,059
Ladies and gentlemen, I am here tonight
to tell you a very strange story.

693
01:27:43,231 --> 01:27:46,132
A story so strange that no one
will believe it.

694
01:27:46,634 --> 01:27:49,728
But, ladies and gentlemen,
seeing is believing...

695
01:27:49,904 --> 01:27:51,701
...and we, my partners and I...

696
01:27:51,873 --> 01:27:54,467
...have brought back the living proof
of our adventure.

697
01:27:54,642 --> 01:27:58,601
...an adventure in which 12
of our party met horrible deaths.

698
01:27:58,880 --> 01:28:02,008
And now, ladies and gentlemen,
before I tell you any more...

699
01:28:02,250 --> 01:28:05,481
...I am going to show you the greatest
thing your eyes ever beheld.

700
01:28:05,853 --> 01:28:09,220
He was a king and a god
in the world he knew...

701
01:28:09,390 --> 01:28:13,190
...but now he comes to civilization
merely a captive...

702
01:28:13,361 --> 01:28:15,989
...a show to gratify your curiosity.

703
01:28:17,131 --> 01:28:20,532
Ladies and gentlemen, look at Kong.

704
01:28:20,701 --> 01:28:22,566
The Eighth Wonder of the World.

705
01:28:41,022 --> 01:28:43,752
And now I want to introduce
Miss Ann Darrow...

706
01:28:43,925 --> 01:28:46,860
...the bravest girl
I have ever known.

707
01:28:57,405 --> 01:28:59,999
There the beast
and here the beauty.

708
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:03,701
She has lived through an experience
no other woman ever dreamed of.

709
01:29:03,878 --> 01:29:08,542
And she was saved from the very grasp
of Kong by her future husband.

710
01:29:08,716 --> 01:29:12,880
I want you to meet a very brave
gentleman, Mr. John Driscoll.

711
01:29:23,764 --> 01:29:26,699
And now before I tell you
the full story of our voyage...

712
01:29:26,867 --> 01:29:29,802
...I will ask the gentlemen
of the press to come forward...

713
01:29:29,971 --> 01:29:33,498
...so that the audience may see them
take the first photographs...

714
01:29:33,674 --> 01:29:36,507
...of Kong and his captors.

715
01:29:36,677 --> 01:29:38,338
All right, boys.

716
01:29:43,517 --> 01:29:47,476
Miss Darrow first, alone.
Stand in front of Kong, Ann.

717
01:29:51,993 --> 01:29:53,927
- All set? Make it a good one.
- Okay.

718
01:29:54,095 --> 01:29:55,392
Shoot.

719
01:30:02,670 --> 01:30:07,164
Don't be alarmed. Those chains
are made of chrome steel.

720
01:30:11,712 --> 01:30:14,010
- It's all right, Ann.
- Get them together, boys.

721
01:30:14,181 --> 01:30:17,639
- They're going to be married tomorrow.
- Put your arm around her, Driscoll.

722
01:30:20,454 --> 01:30:21,716
Wait a minute. Hold on.

723
01:30:21,889 --> 01:30:25,086
- He thinks you're attacking the girl.
- All the roaring, swell picture.

724
01:30:34,101 --> 01:30:35,432
Come on, it's loose!

725
01:31:26,554 --> 01:31:29,717
Send the riot squad and ambulances.
Kong has escaped.

726
01:32:38,559 --> 01:32:40,049
You're safe now, dear.

727
01:32:40,761 --> 01:32:43,161
It's like a horrible dream.

728
01:32:44,165 --> 01:32:46,326
It's like being back
on the island again.

729
01:32:46,500 --> 01:32:49,264
Now, it's all right. Don't worry.

730
01:32:49,436 --> 01:32:51,904
I'm gonna stay right here with you.

731
01:32:52,072 --> 01:32:54,802
Anyhow, you know
they're bound to get him.

732
01:33:54,134 --> 01:33:55,863
Jack, he's climbing up
outside there.

733
01:33:56,036 --> 01:33:58,436
- He's got Ann. He's taken her up.
- The roof, quick.

734
01:35:03,270 --> 01:35:04,965
Ann, Ann!

735
01:35:05,139 --> 01:35:08,108
How can we follow him?
What'll we do?

736
01:35:08,275 --> 01:35:10,675
Fire department searchlights
on the roof.

737
01:35:10,844 --> 01:35:13,210
Yeah, they'll keep him in sight.

738
01:36:59,420 --> 01:37:02,480
<i>Attention all stations.</i>
<i>Kong is going west.</i>

739
01:37:02,656 --> 01:37:04,851
<i>He is making for</i>
<i>the Empire State Building.</i>

740
01:37:05,025 --> 01:37:07,585
<i>Stand by for further reports.</i>

741
01:37:07,761 --> 01:37:11,026
- Lf he goes up there, what can we do?
- We won't get near him.

742
01:37:11,465 --> 01:37:13,763
<i>Kong is climbing</i>
<i>the Empire State Building.</i>

743
01:37:13,934 --> 01:37:16,596
<i>He is still carrying Ann Darrow.</i>
<i>That is all.</i>

744
01:37:16,770 --> 01:37:18,533
That licks us.

745
01:37:18,806 --> 01:37:20,603
- One thing we haven't thought of.
- What?

746
01:37:20,774 --> 01:37:22,969
Airplanes. If he should put
Ann down...

747
01:37:23,143 --> 01:37:25,441
...and they fly close
to pick him without her...

748
01:37:25,612 --> 01:37:27,136
You're right. Planes.

749
01:37:27,314 --> 01:37:29,009
Call the field.

750
01:38:02,683 --> 01:38:05,516
- Here come the planes.
- They'll get him.

751
01:38:08,122 --> 01:38:10,989
- Can they shoot him and not hit Ann?
- They'll be shooting.

752
01:42:54,341 --> 01:42:57,572
Ann. Ann, hang on, dear.

753
01:42:57,744 --> 01:43:00,838
- Ann, are you all right?
- Jack!

754
01:43:17,564 --> 01:43:19,293
Just a moment. Wait a minute.

755
01:43:19,466 --> 01:43:21,331
Let me through.
My name is Denham.

756
01:43:21,501 --> 01:43:23,867
Just a moment. Oh, lieutenant.

757
01:43:24,037 --> 01:43:26,801
- Lieutenant, I'm Carl Denham.
- Carl Denham.

758
01:43:26,973 --> 01:43:29,669
Denham? Oh, that's the man
that captured the monster.

759
01:43:32,712 --> 01:43:36,375
Well, Denham, the airplanes got him.

760
01:43:37,951 --> 01:43:41,387
Oh, no, it wasn't the airplanes.

761
01:43:41,555 --> 01:43:44,649
It was beauty killed the beast.

762
01:44:19,960 --> 01:44:21,951
