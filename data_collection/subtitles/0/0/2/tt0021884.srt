1
00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:07,700
How do you do?

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:12,600
Mr Carl Laemmle feels
it would be a little unkind

3
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,400
to present this picture without
just a word of friendly warning.

4
00:00:17,500 --> 00:00:20,800
We are about to unfold
the story of Frankenstein.

5
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,200
A man of science,

6
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:26,900
who sought to create
a man after his own image,

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,700
without reckoning upon God.

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,700
It is one of the strangest tales ever told.

9
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,700
It deals with the two great
mysteries of creation:

10
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:40,800
life and death.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,400
I think it will thrill you.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,100
It may shock you.

13
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,600
It might even horrify you.

14
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,300
So if any of you feel that you do not care
to subject your nerves to such a strain,

15
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,800
now is your chance to, er...

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:00,500
Well, we've warned you.

17
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:12,300
(man)... dona eis, Domine:
et lux perpetua luceat eis.

18
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,500
Amen.

19
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,500
(bell tolls)

20
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,400
(sobbing)

21
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,300
Down. Down, you fool!

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,700
Now!

23
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:19,800
Come on!

24
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
Hurry, hurry.

25
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,700
The moon's rising. We've no time to lose.

26
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,500
(clattering)

27
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,700
Careful!

28
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,600
Here he comes!

29
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:12,900
He's just resting.
Waiting for a new life to come.

30
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,100
Here we are.

31
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:47,300
Look, it's still here.

32
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,100
Climb up and cut the rope.

33
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,100
- No!
- Go on. It can't hurt you.

34
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
Here's a knife.

35
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,700
Look out!

36
00:06:24,600 --> 00:06:26,800
Here's the knife.

37
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,900
Here I come.

38
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,300
Is it all right?

39
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:37,900
The neck's broken. The brain is useless!

40
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,900
We must find another brain.

41
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:52,600
That'll do, gentlemen.

42
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,400
(laughter)

43
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:15,400
And in conclusion, ladies and gentlemen,

44
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:19,400
here we have one of the most
perfect specimens of the human brain

45
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:22,000
ever to come to my attention
at the university.

46
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,600
And here, the abnormal brain
of the typical criminal.

47
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:27,500
Observe, ladies and gentlemen,

48
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,700
the scarcity of convolutions
on the frontal lobe

49
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,500
as compared to that of the normal brain,

50
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:38,600
and the distinct degeneration
of the middle frontal lobe.

51
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:41,000
All of these degenerate characteristics

52
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:44,300
check amazingly with the history
of the dead man before us,

53
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:49,600
whose life was one of brutality,
of violence and murder.

54
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:52,600
These jars will remain here
for your further inspection.

55
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:55,600
Thank you, gentlemen.
The class is dismissed.

56
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,900
(cries out)

57
00:08:58,400 --> 00:09:00,900
(gong)

58
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,800
(faint voices)

59
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,300
Herr Victor Moritz.

60
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:38,000
Victor.

61
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,600
- I'm so glad you've come.
- What is it, Elizabeth?

62
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:44,100
- Oh, you've heard from Henry.
- Yes. The first word in four months.

63
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:46,700
It just came.

64
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
- Victor, you must help me.
- Of course I'll help you.

65
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
I'm afraid.

66
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,400
I've read this over and over again, but
they're just words that I can't understand.

67
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,600
Listen.

68
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,800
"You must have faith in me,
Elizabeth. Wait."

69
00:10:02,900 --> 00:10:06,100
"My work must come first,
even before you."

70
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,900
"At night, the winds howl
in the mountains."

71
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,000
"There is no one here."

72
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,300
"Prying eyes can't peer into my secret."

73
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:16,900
- What can he mean?
- What does he say then?

74
00:10:19,300 --> 00:10:23,700
"I am living in an abandoned watchtower
close to the town of Goldstadt."

75
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:27,200
"Only my assistant is here
to help me with my experiments."

76
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:31,600
- Oh. His experiments.
- Yes, that's what frightens me.

77
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:35,600
The day we announced our engagement,
he told me of his experiments.

78
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:40,300
He said he was close to a discovery so
terrific that he doubted his own sanity.

79
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:44,300
There was a strange look in his eyes.
Some mystery.

80
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:46,600
His words carried me right away.

81
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,700
Of course, I've never doubted him.
But still, I worry. I can't help it.

82
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:56,300
And now this letter. All this uncertainty
can't go on. I must know.

83
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,900
Victor, have you seen him?

84
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:01,400
Yes. About three weeks ago.

85
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:05,400
I met him walking alone in the woods.
He spoke to me of his work, too.

86
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:08,100
I asked him if I might visit his laboratory.

87
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:11,100
He just glared at me
and said he would let no one go there.

88
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,100
- His manner was very strange.
- Oh, what can we do?

89
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,800
- If he should be ill!
- Now, don't worry.

90
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:21,400
I'll go to Dr Waldman,
Henry's old professor in medical school.

91
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,000
Perhaps he can tell me
more about all this.

92
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,000
Victor, you're a dear.

93
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,500
You know I'd go to the ends
of the earth for you.

94
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:31,600
I shouldn't like that.
I'm far too fond of you.

95
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,200
I wish you were.

96
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,200
- Victor.
- I'm sorry.

97
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:45,200
Good night, Victor.
And thank you. Thank you.

98
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,000
Good night. And don't worry. Promise?

99
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:51,100
I won't.

100
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,800
- Victor!
- What is it?

101
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,100
- I'm coming with you.
- You can't!

102
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,700
I must. I'll be ready in a minute.

103
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:14,100
Herr Frankenstein is a most
brilliant young man, yet so erratic.

104
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:16,200
He troubles me.

105
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,100
I'm worried about Henry.
Why has he left the university?

106
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:23,700
He was doing so well
and he seemed so happy with his work.

107
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,200
You know, his researches in the field
of chemical galvanism and electrobiology

108
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:33,000
were far in advance of our theories
here at the university.

109
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,900
In fact, they had reached
a most advanced stage.

110
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,300
They were becoming dangerous.

111
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,800
Herr Frankenstein is greatly changed.

112
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,400
You mean changed
as a result of his work?

113
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,400
Yes. His work.

114
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:48,900
His insane ambition to create life.

115
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:52,600
How? How?

116
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:56,800
Please tell us everything, whatever it is.

117
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,600
The bodies we use now,
dissecting them for lecture purposes,

118
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,900
were not perfect enough
for his experiments, he said.

119
00:13:03,900 --> 00:13:06,700
He wished us to supply him
with other bodies,

120
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,800
and we were not to be too particular
as to where and how we got them.

121
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,300
I told him that his demands
were unreasonable,

122
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:17,800
and so he left the university
to work unhampered.

123
00:13:17,900 --> 00:13:21,300
- He found what he needed elsewhere.
- Oh. The bodies of animals.

124
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:24,500
Well, what are the lives
of a few rabbits and dogs?

125
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:27,000
You do not quite get what I mean.

126
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,400
Herr Frankenstein was
interested only in human life.

127
00:13:32,100 --> 00:13:35,400
First to destroy it, then re-create it.

128
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:39,300
There you have his mad dream.

129
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:45,300
- Can we go to him?
- You will not be very welcome.

130
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:48,200
What does that matter? I must see him.

131
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:54,000
Dr Waldman, you have influence
with Henry. Won't you come with us?

132
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:58,100
I'm sorry, but Herr Frankenstein
is no longer my pupil.

133
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:02,500
But he respects you.
Won't you help us to take him away?

134
00:14:02,900 --> 00:14:05,800
Very well, Frulein.
I've warned you.

135
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,200
But if you wish it, I will go.

136
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,200
(thunder rumbles)

137
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,400
- Fritz!
- Hello.

138
00:14:35,900 --> 00:14:39,600
- Have you finished those connections?
- Yes, they're done.

139
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:43,400
Well, come down, then, and help.
We've lots to do.

140
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,700
(thunderclap)

141
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,600
Look out!

142
00:15:12,900 --> 00:15:14,300
Fool!

143
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:16,500
If this storm develops as I hope,

144
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:19,900
you will have plenty to be afraid of
before the night's over.

145
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Go on, fix the electrodes.

146
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,600
(crackling)

147
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,600
This storm will be magnificent.

148
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,300
All the electrical secrets of heaven.

149
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:44,000
And this time we're ready.
Hey, Fritz? Ready.

150
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,300
Oh!

151
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,500
- Why, what's the matter?
- Look.

152
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,500
There's nothing to fear. Look.

153
00:15:56,700 --> 00:15:58,800
No blood, no decay.

154
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,000
Just a few stitches.

155
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,500
And look. Here's the final touch.

156
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,600
- The brain you stole, Fritz.
- Yes.

157
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:16,700
Think of it-the brain of a dead man

158
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:20,400
waiting to live again in a body
I made with my own hands.

159
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,700
With my own hands.

160
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:29,600
Let's have one final test.
Throw the switches.

161
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,800
(thunderclap)

162
00:16:46,600 --> 00:16:48,300
Good.

163
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:51,600
In 15 minutes, the storm
should be at its height.

164
00:16:51,700 --> 00:16:53,700
Then we'll be ready.

165
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,400
(knocking at door)

166
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:57,600
What's that?

167
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,900
- There's someone there.
- Shh! Quiet.

168
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:08,600
Send them away!
Nobody must come here.

169
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,500
Here. Cover this.

170
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:27,500
Whoever it is, don't let them in.

171
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,600
Leave them to me.

172
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,000
Of all the times
for anybody to come! Now!

173
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:39,600
- (Fritz mutters)
- (knocking continues)

174
00:17:39,700 --> 00:17:43,300
I'll show them, messing about
at this time of night. Got too much to do.

175
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:46,500
- (banging at door)
- Wait a minute! All right, all right!

176
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:49,700
Wait a minute, I'm coming.

177
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:54,200
- It's Dr Waldman, Fritz.
- You can't see him. Go away.

178
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,800
(knocking continues)

179
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,600
All right, knock! You won't get in.

180
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,300
(mutters)

181
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:11,700
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

182
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:14,100
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

183
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:16,600
Henry!

184
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:19,300
- (Elizabeth) Open the door!
- (Victor) Let us in!

185
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:23,400
Who is it? What do you want?
You must leave me alone now.

186
00:18:23,500 --> 00:18:26,000
It's Elizabeth! Open the door!

187
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:39,200
- Henry!
- Frankenstein!

188
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,200
- What do you want?
- Open the door!

189
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:47,200
- You must leave me alone.
- (Elizabeth) At least give us shelter.

190
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:58,000
- What's this nonsense of locked doors?
- Henry!

191
00:18:58,100 --> 00:19:01,800
Elizabeth, please, won't you go away?
Won't you trust me just for tonight?

192
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,600
- You're ill. What's the matter?
- Nothing. I'm quite all right. Truly I am.

193
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:09,300
Can't you see I mustn't be disturbed?

194
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:13,200
You'll ruin everything.
My experiment is almost completed.

195
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:15,900
Wait a moment. I understand.

196
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:20,000
I believe in you.
But I cannot leave you tonight.

197
00:19:20,100 --> 00:19:24,200
- You've got to leave!
- Henry, you're inhuman. You're crazy!

198
00:19:25,100 --> 00:19:27,200
Crazy, am I?

199
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,600
We'll see whether I'm crazy or not.

200
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,800
Come on up.

201
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:54,200
You're quite sure you want to come in?

202
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
Very well.

203
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,900
Forgive me, but I'm forced
to take unusual precautions.

204
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,700
Sit down, please.

205
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,700
Sit down!

206
00:20:37,300 --> 00:20:40,500
You too, Elizabeth. Please.

207
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:46,400
A moment ago, you said I was crazy.

208
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,700
- Tomorrow, we'll see about that.
- (Fritz) Don't touch that!

209
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:52,900
(thunderclap)

210
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:59,100
I'm sorry, Doctor, but I insist.

211
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,400
Please.

212
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:23,400
Doctor Waldman, I learnt a great deal
from you at the university

213
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:26,600
about the violet ray, the ultraviolet ray,

214
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,400
which you said was
the highest colour in the spectrum.

215
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:33,600
You were wrong.

216
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,700
Here, in this machinery,
I have gone beyond that.

217
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:44,200
I have discovered the great ray
that first brought life into the world.

218
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,700
Oh. And your proof?

219
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,000
Tonight you shall have your proof.

220
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,200
At first I experimented
only with dead animals,

221
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:59,500
and then a human heart, which
I kept beating for three weeks.

222
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:05,900
But now I'm going to turn
that ray on that body,

223
00:22:05,900 --> 00:22:08,300
and endow it with life.

224
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,700
And you really believe
that you can bring life to the dead?

225
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:15,200
That body is not dead.

226
00:22:15,300 --> 00:22:17,400
It has never lived.

227
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:22,000
I created it. I made it with my own hands

228
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:26,000
from the bodies I took from graves,
from the gallows, anywhere.

229
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:32,100
Go and see for yourself.

230
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:34,100
(thunderclap)

231
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,300
You too.

232
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:43,100
Dead, hey?

233
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,800
Quite a good scene, isn't it?

234
00:22:52,900 --> 00:22:55,300
One man crazy,

235
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:58,000
three very sane spectators.

236
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,800
(thunderclap)

237
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:02,800
Yes!

238
00:23:03,800 --> 00:23:05,900
Test the batteries.

239
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Look. It's moving.

240
00:24:56,600 --> 00:24:59,300
It's alive. It's alive!

241
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,700
It's alive. It's moving. It's alive!

242
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:08,500
It's alive! It's alive! It's alive!

243
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,300
- It's alive!
- Henry, in the name of God!

244
00:25:11,400 --> 00:25:14,100
In the name of God?!
Now I know what it...

245
00:25:14,200 --> 00:25:16,700
(voice drowned out by thunder)

246
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:26,100
Henry is well, but he's very busy.

247
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:28,300
He said he would
get in touch with you soon.

248
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,600
Don't worry about him, Baron.
He'll be home in a few days.

249
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,400
You two have it all arranged,
haven't you?

250
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:37,500
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

251
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,900
But I'm not.

252
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,500
Anyone can see with half an eye
that there's something wrong.

253
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,500
And I've two eyes,
and pretty good ones at that.

254
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,700
- Well, what is it?
- You're quite mistaken, Baron.

255
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:52,500
What's the matter with my son?
What's he doing?

256
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,700
He's completing his experiments.

257
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,100
Why does he go messing around
an old ruined windmill

258
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:02,700
when he has a decent house,
a bath, good food and drink,

259
00:26:02,800 --> 00:26:07,000
and a darned pretty girl to come back to?
Would you tell me that?

260
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:10,900
- Baron, you don't understand.
- I understand perfectly well.

261
00:26:11,000 --> 00:26:14,300
There's another woman,
and you're afraid to tell me.

262
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:17,200
Pretty sordid experiments
these must be. Huh!

263
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:20,800
- Oh, but you're wrong!
- And how do you know?

264
00:26:20,900 --> 00:26:23,700
If you please, Herr Baron,
the burgomaster.

265
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:27,100
- Well, tell him to go away.
- But he says it's important.

266
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:31,700
Nothing the burgomaster can say
can be of the slightest importance.

267
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:36,000
Good day, Herr Baron. Frulein.

268
00:26:36,300 --> 00:26:38,300
Well, what do you want?

269
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,200
If it's trouble, go away.
I've trouble enough.

270
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:44,800
- Oh, there's no trouble, sir.
- What do you mean, "no trouble"?

271
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:47,000
There's nothing but trouble.

272
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:50,900
- I brought you these flowers.
- Thank you, Herr Vogel.

273
00:26:51,300 --> 00:26:54,600
Both in my private and official
capacities as burgomaster...

274
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:58,600
Yes, yes, yes, we know all about that,
but what do you want?

275
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:03,100
What I really want to know is
when will the wedding be, if you please.

276
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:07,100
Unless Henry comes to his senses,
there'll be no wedding at all.

277
00:27:07,700 --> 00:27:12,200
- But the village is already prepared.
- Well, tell them to unprepare.

278
00:27:12,300 --> 00:27:14,800
But such a lovely bride...

279
00:27:14,900 --> 00:27:17,800
Such a fine young man,
the very image of his father.

280
00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:21,100
- Heaven forbid.
- But, sir, everything is ready!

281
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,600
I know that!
Don't keep on saying so, you idiot!

282
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,800
There's nothing to cry about.

283
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:30,800
Good day, Miss Elizabeth.
Good day, Herr Moritz.

284
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,700
Good day, Herr Vogel.

285
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:36,500
Good day, Herr Baron.

286
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:39,900
And good riddance to you.

287
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:43,200
There you are. Huh! You see how it is.

288
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,500
The whole village is kept waiting,
the bride is kept waiting,

289
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:52,700
and I am kept waiting. Henry must
come home, if I have to fetch him myself.

290
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:55,300
No, no, Baron. What about his work?

291
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,200
Stuff and nonsense.
What about his wedding?

292
00:27:58,300 --> 00:28:01,100
There is another woman...

293
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:03,300
and I'm going to find her.

294
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,600
(Dr Waldman huffs)

295
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,900
Come and sit down, Doctor.

296
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,800
You must be patient.

297
00:28:19,900 --> 00:28:22,400
Do you expect perfection at once?

298
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:25,900
This creature of yours
should be kept under guard.

299
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,800
Mark my words, he will prove dangerous.

300
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,300
Dangerous?

301
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,500
Poor old Waldman.

302
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:41,300
Have you never wanted
to do anything that was dangerous?

303
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:45,500
Where should we be if nobody tried
to find out what lies beyond?

304
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:49,400
Have you never wanted to look
beyond the clouds and the stars?

305
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:52,600
Or to know what causes the trees to bud?

306
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:55,600
And what changes
the darkness into light?

307
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,100
But if you talk like that...
people call you crazy.

308
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:08,400
Well, if I could discover
just one of these things -

309
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:10,700
what eternity is, for example -

310
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:15,100
I wouldn't care
if they did think I was crazy.

311
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:19,600
You're young, my friend.
Your success has intoxicated you.

312
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:22,300
Wake up and look facts in the face!

313
00:29:23,300 --> 00:29:25,700
Here we have a fiend whose brain...

314
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:28,500
Whose brain must be
given time to develop.

315
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,900
It's a perfectly good brain, Doctor.

316
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:35,300
Well, you ought to know.
It came from your own laboratory.

317
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:40,400
The brain that was stolen from
my laboratory was a criminal brain.

318
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,200
Oh, well.
After all, it's only a piece of dead tissue.

319
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:56,500
Only evil can come of it.

320
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,600
Your health will be ruined
if you persist in this madness.

321
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,300
I'm astonishingly sane, Doctor.

322
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:05,600
You have created a monster
and it will destroy you.

323
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,300
Patience, patience.

324
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:11,800
I believe in this monster, as you call it.

325
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,900
And if you don't, well,
you must leave me alone.

326
00:30:15,000 --> 00:30:17,800
But think of Elizabeth. Your father.

327
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:20,000
Elizabeth believes in me.

328
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:22,900
My father? He never believes in anyone.

329
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:27,800
I've got to experiment further.

330
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,400
He's only a few days old, remember.

331
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:34,000
So far, he's been kept
in complete darkness.

332
00:30:34,100 --> 00:30:36,300
Wait till I bring him into the light.

333
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,500
(footsteps)

334
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:45,200
Here he comes. Let's turn out the light.

335
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,000
Come in.

336
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:29,000
Come in.

337
00:31:49,100 --> 00:31:52,400
Sit down. Sit down!

338
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,700
You see? It understands.

339
00:32:02,600 --> 00:32:04,400
Watch.

340
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:51,400
(Waldman) Take care now,
Frankenstein. Take care.

341
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,500
Shut out the light.

342
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,500
Sit down.

343
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:20,400
Go and sit down.

344
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:43,800
- It understands this time. It's wonderful.
- Frankenstein, where is it?!

345
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,200
Aagh!

346
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,400
Quiet, you fool!

347
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:52,200
Get away with that torch.

348
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,600
- Aagh!
- Quick!

349
00:34:09,700 --> 00:34:11,900
Fetch the rope, quick.

350
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:13,800
Stop pushing.

351
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:16,900
- Get him to the cellar.
- Shoot it! It's a monster.

352
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,300
(clanking chains)

353
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,500
(howling)

354
00:34:31,500 --> 00:34:33,600
Quiet. Quiet!

355
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,900
Stop that! You'll have
the whole countryside on us!

356
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,500
Come away.
He has the strength of ten men!

357
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,600
(monster yells)

358
00:34:46,700 --> 00:34:48,800
Here, give me that!

359
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:52,300
Come away, Fritz.

360
00:34:52,400 --> 00:34:55,500
Leave it alone. Leave it alone.

361
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:14,800
(yelling)

362
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:21,600
(screaming)

363
00:35:22,700 --> 00:35:25,200
Listen. What's that? Who's there?

364
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:31,000
(yelling)

365
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,400
It's Fritz!

366
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:40,000
(monster growls)

367
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,900
Come on, Doctor. Quick, hurry.

368
00:35:47,600 --> 00:35:50,000
(growls)

369
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,000
Get back.

370
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:55,000
- (growls)
- Get out!

371
00:35:55,700 --> 00:35:57,900
Come on, quickly.

372
00:36:04,500 --> 00:36:06,400
(growling)

373
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:12,600
(banging on door)

374
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,900
(banging continues)

375
00:36:20,500 --> 00:36:23,600
He hated Fritz.
Fritz always tormented him.

376
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,300
Come, pull yourself together.

377
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,800
- What can we do?
- Kill it, as you would any savage animal.

378
00:36:32,900 --> 00:36:36,100
We must overpower him first.
Get me a hypodermic needle.

379
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:38,200
- It's murder.
- It's our only chance.

380
00:36:38,300 --> 00:36:42,300
In a few minutes, he'll be through
that door. Come, quick. Hurry.

381
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:45,900
(banging on door continues)

382
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,400
- Got it?
- Yes, here it is.

383
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:59,100
- It's very strong. Half-grain solution.
- Good. Now then.

384
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:04,900
You stand there. When he goes toward
you, I will make the injection in his back.

385
00:37:06,300 --> 00:37:08,400
- Ready?
- Yes.

386
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,100
(growls)

387
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,200
Aagh!

388
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,200
Get back! Back!

389
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:04,300
(knock at door)

390
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:10,400
Dr Waldman. Dr Waldman!

391
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:14,400
- Are you hurt?
- No, I'm all right. It's nothing.

392
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:16,500
See who's at the door.

393
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:23,000
What's happening? Elizabeth and
your father are coming to see you.

394
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,700
- Keep them out.
- Too late!

395
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,600
They must not see that.
Here, quick, give me a hand.

396
00:38:27,700 --> 00:38:29,800
Quick!

397
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:48,700
Henry, hurry, get that blood off your face
before your father and Elizabeth get here.

398
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,200
Well, er...

399
00:38:58,300 --> 00:39:01,700
Pretty sort of place for
my son to be in, I must say.

400
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,800
- Is that the front door?
- Yes, this is it.

401
00:39:05,900 --> 00:39:07,700
Right.

402
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:10,000
I don't like it, but...

403
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:12,200
here goes.

404
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:17,000
(tuts)

405
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:19,900
There doesn't seem to be
anybody in the place.

406
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:25,400
God...

407
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,500
What a... What a forsaken place.

408
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:35,900
Are you trying to burn it down, eh?
What's that for, eh?

409
00:39:36,000 --> 00:39:39,900
Well, what's the matter with you? You
look as if you've been kicked by a horse.

410
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:42,000
- Where's Henry?
- Why...

411
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:44,500
- Well?
- He can't be disturbed just now.

412
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:47,800
Oh, can't he? Huh!
I'll soon settle that nonsense.

413
00:39:47,900 --> 00:39:49,400
Victor, where is he?

414
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,000
This place seems
to drive everybody crazy.

415
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:54,800
- (banging)
- Oh, heavens... What's that?

416
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,000
I beg your pardon. I am Dr Waldman.

417
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:01,400
Oh, are you? I'm Baron Frankenstein.

418
00:40:01,500 --> 00:40:04,400
Perhaps you know what
all this tommyrot's about.

419
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:07,500
I... (splutters) I'll be shot if I do!

420
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,100
I advise you to take
Henry away from here at once.

421
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,100
Well, what do you suppose
I'm here for? Pleasure?

422
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,300
Nah.

423
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,000
Where are you, my dear?
Oh, there you are.

424
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:19,200
Let's see what's up the awful stairs.

425
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:22,900
I don't know how the deuce
I'm going to get up 'em, but...

426
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,300
(Baron mutters)

427
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,700
Leave them alone.

428
00:40:27,700 --> 00:40:31,900
No banisters or anything else...
How much further?

429
00:40:34,600 --> 00:40:36,600
Come in.

430
00:40:38,500 --> 00:40:40,600
- Henry.
- Elizabeth.

431
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:45,900
Henry!

432
00:40:46,600 --> 00:40:49,300
Victor! Dr Waldman! Come quickly.

433
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,400
- My dear, what have they done to you?
- Poor Fritz... It's all my fault...

434
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,600
Get him on the sofa.

435
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:09,000
Have you got any brandy?

436
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,800
Quick, quick, quick.

437
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:19,000
Here, I'll do that.

438
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,000
My boy... Now, now...

439
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,900
Now drink. Drink this.

440
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:28,300
There. There, that's better.

441
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:31,200
I'm going to take
you home with me, Henry.

442
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:35,600
No, I can't. My work. What will happen
to the records of my experiment?

443
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,700
- We will preserve them.
- And...

444
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:40,400
I will see that it is painlessly destroyed.

445
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:42,900
Yes, yes. Leave it all to me.

446
00:41:43,000 --> 00:41:45,400
Poor Fritz. All my fault.

447
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,800
There, Henry.
You can't do any more now.

448
00:41:47,900 --> 00:41:50,600
You must come home
until you get well again.

449
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,400
You'll soon feel better
when you get out of here.

450
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,700
(gags)

451
00:43:15,300 --> 00:43:17,400
(chokes)

452
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,000
It's like heaven being with you again.

453
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:08,500
Heaven wasn't so far away
all the time, you know.

454
00:44:08,600 --> 00:44:11,200
I know. But I didn't realise it.

455
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:16,100
My work. Those horrible days and nights.

456
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,200
I couldn't think of anything else.

457
00:44:19,300 --> 00:44:22,500
Henry, you're not to think
of those things any more.

458
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:25,700
- You promised.
- All right.

459
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:29,200
Let's think about us.
When will our wedding be?

460
00:44:32,200 --> 00:44:34,300
Let's make it soon.

461
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:36,500
As soon as you like.

462
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:45,400
For three generations,

463
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:49,800
these orange blossoms
have been worn at our weddings.

464
00:44:49,800 --> 00:44:52,500
Your great-grandfather wore this, Henry.

465
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,600
Looks as good as new now, hey?

466
00:44:56,600 --> 00:45:01,100
And here. Here is one to make
the best man look still better.

467
00:45:02,100 --> 00:45:07,600
30 years ago, I placed this
on your mother's head, Henry.

468
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:13,600
Today, you'll make me very happy
by doing the same for Elizabeth.

469
00:45:13,700 --> 00:45:16,700
And I hope, in 30 years' time,

470
00:45:16,700 --> 00:45:20,200
a youngster of yours
will be carrying on the tradition.

471
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:24,000
And now, how about a little drink, eh?

472
00:45:25,700 --> 00:45:29,700
My grandfather bought this wine
and laid it down.

473
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:35,300
My grandmother wouldn't let him drink it.
Bless her heart.

474
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,800
Here's to your very good health.

475
00:45:37,900 --> 00:45:40,900
Well, are you all full?
Yes? Come along.

476
00:45:41,000 --> 00:45:45,300
Here's a health to a son
of the House of Frankenstein.

477
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,000
(all) A son to the House
of Frankenstein.

478
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:52,600
Here's a jolly good health
to young Frankenstein.

479
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:54,700
(all) Young Frankenstein.

480
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:01,500
Give the servants some champagne.
This stuff's wasted on 'em.

481
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:05,000
Well, well, well.

482
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:10,700
(Baron) Go on, mop it up.
It'll do you good.

483
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,700
- House of Frankenstein.
- To the House of Frankenstein.

484
00:46:15,300 --> 00:46:17,800
Now then. Now be off
about your business.

485
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:27,100
- (merriment outside)
- Listen! Listen to 'em!

486
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,800
The boys and girls of the village
are out here.

487
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:38,500
(cheering and singing)

488
00:46:44,700 --> 00:46:47,700
It's extraordinary how friendly
you can make a lot of people

489
00:46:47,800 --> 00:46:50,100
on a couple of bottles of beer.

490
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,700
Tomorrow they'll all be fighting.

491
00:46:52,700 --> 00:46:54,800
No doubt!

492
00:46:54,900 --> 00:46:57,700
- They're calling for you, Baron.
- Hey-ho.

493
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,100
Well, I suppose I'd better show myself.

494
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,100
(cheering)

495
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,100
Quiet!

496
00:47:08,200 --> 00:47:10,500
Thank you all very much indeed.

497
00:47:10,600 --> 00:47:14,000
I'm very pleased to see you all,
and I hope there's plenty of beer.

498
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,500
There's lots more where that came from.

499
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,600
(cheering)

500
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:56,100
You stay here, Maria.
I'll just take a look at my traps.

501
00:47:56,100 --> 00:47:59,900
Then we'll go to the village
and have a grand time, huh?

502
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,900
- You won't be long, Daddy?
- Oh, no.

503
00:48:01,900 --> 00:48:04,900
If Franz comes by,
tell him I'll be back soon.

504
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:08,000
Daddy, won't you stay
and play with me a little while?

505
00:48:08,100 --> 00:48:10,200
I'm too busy, darling.

506
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,900
You stay and play with the kitty, huh?

507
00:48:13,300 --> 00:48:15,700
- Bye, Daddy.
- Goodbye.

508
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:17,500
Be a good girl now.

509
00:48:18,500 --> 00:48:20,500
Come on, kitty.

510
00:48:50,200 --> 00:48:53,100
Who are you? I'm Maria.

511
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,900
Will you play with me?

512
00:49:11,400 --> 00:49:13,800
Would you like one of my flowers?

513
00:49:37,000 --> 00:49:40,200
You have those, and I'll have these.

514
00:49:46,600 --> 00:49:48,800
I can make a boat.

515
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:54,700
See how mine float?

516
00:50:04,200 --> 00:50:06,300
Ohh!

517
00:50:15,000 --> 00:50:17,500
No, you're hurting me! No!

518
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,100
(? Bavarian folk music)

519
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:29,700
- Henry.
- Elizabeth!

520
00:51:30,900 --> 00:51:33,900
How lovely you look.
But you shouldn't be here.

521
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:36,100
I must see you for a minute.

522
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:42,200
Why? What's the matter?

523
00:51:47,300 --> 00:51:49,600
Could you leave us for a moment?

524
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,300
Why, of course.

525
00:52:00,300 --> 00:52:02,600
- Why, what is it?
- I'm so glad you're safe.

526
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,900
Safe? Of course I'm safe.

527
00:52:04,900 --> 00:52:08,100
But you look worried. Is anything wrong?

528
00:52:08,100 --> 00:52:09,800
No.

529
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,200
No, forget my foolishness.

530
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:14,800
It was just a mood.
There's nothing the matter.

531
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:16,900
Of course there isn't!

532
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:20,800
Henry, I'm afraid. Terribly afraid.

533
00:52:21,500 --> 00:52:24,000
Where is Dr Waldman?
Why is he late for the wedding?

534
00:52:24,000 --> 00:52:26,700
He's always late. He'll be here soon.

535
00:52:27,800 --> 00:52:29,900
Something is going to happen.

536
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:32,900
I feel it. I can't get it out of my mind.

537
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:35,300
You're just nervous.

538
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,600
All the excitement and preparation.

539
00:52:37,900 --> 00:52:42,300
No. No, it isn't that. I've felt it all day.

540
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:45,700
Something is coming between us.

541
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:48,200
I know it. I know it!

542
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,300
Sit down and rest. You look so tired.

543
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,300
- If I could just save us from it.
- From what, dear? From what?

544
00:52:58,700 --> 00:53:00,100
I don't know!

545
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:04,500
If I could just get it out of my mind!
I'd die if I had to lose you now, Henry.

546
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:07,200
Lose me? Why, I'll always be with you.

547
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,300
Will you, Henry? Are you sure?

548
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,800
I love you so.

549
00:53:13,900 --> 00:53:17,900
Sure. How beautiful you look.

550
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,900
Henry! Henry! (knocking at door)

551
00:53:21,000 --> 00:53:23,400
What's that? What's that?!

552
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:25,600
Henry! Dr Waldman!

553
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:29,900
- What about Dr Waldman?
- Henry, don't leave me!

554
00:53:29,900 --> 00:53:33,500
- No, darling, you stay here.
- Henry! Henry!

555
00:53:34,100 --> 00:53:36,000
Dr Waldman's been
murdered in the tower.

556
00:53:36,100 --> 00:53:36,900
The monster.

557
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,100
He's been seen in the hills,
terrorising the mountainside.

558
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:41,400
(moaning)

559
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:43,900
He's in the house.

560
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,100
He's upstairs!

561
00:53:49,700 --> 00:53:51,700
(bells ring out)

562
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:53,900
(agitated shouting outside)

563
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:13,900
(moaning)

564
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:16,100
It's in the cellars.

565
00:54:50,800 --> 00:54:51,800
(moans)

566
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:53,100
(screams)

567
00:54:53,100 --> 00:54:55,700
- (mimics scream)
- (screams)

568
00:54:59,300 --> 00:55:02,000
(Elizabeth continues screaming)

569
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:05,700
It's Elizabeth! Come on.

570
00:55:12,200 --> 00:55:13,700
(clattering)

571
00:55:19,400 --> 00:55:21,300
Elizabeth!

572
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,600
What is it?

573
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:30,500
- Don't let him come here.
- No, no, no, darling. It's all right.

574
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:35,100
- Don't let him come here.
- It's all right, darling. It's all right.

575
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:50,700
Oh, look! That's Maria!

576
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,500
(cheering)

577
00:56:52,600 --> 00:56:55,300
Silence! Silence! Silence!

578
00:56:55,300 --> 00:56:57,100
What is it?

579
00:56:57,600 --> 00:57:00,300
Maria. She's drowned.

580
00:57:01,400 --> 00:57:04,600
My poor man.
Why do you bring her here to me?

581
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:07,300
But... But she has been murdered.

582
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,100
(shouting)

583
00:57:12,700 --> 00:57:15,800
Silence! I'll see that justice is done.

584
00:57:15,900 --> 00:57:17,900
Who is it?

585
00:57:26,700 --> 00:57:29,500
- How is Elizabeth now?
- I don't know.

586
00:57:29,600 --> 00:57:33,900
She's still in a daze. Just looks at me
and says nothing. It's maddening.

587
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:36,300
Easy, old man. She'll be all right.

588
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:38,300
- Our wedding day.
- Steady.

589
00:57:38,400 --> 00:57:40,600
Your wedding will be
postponed a day at most.

590
00:57:40,700 --> 00:57:44,400
- A day? I wonder.
- What do you mean?

591
00:57:44,500 --> 00:57:48,700
There can be no wedding while this
horrible creation of mine is still alive.

592
00:57:48,800 --> 00:57:52,200
I made him with these hands,
and with these hands I will destroy him.

593
00:57:52,300 --> 00:57:54,200
- I must find him!
- I'll go with you.

594
00:57:54,200 --> 00:57:57,400
No. You stay here and look after Elizabeth.

595
00:57:57,500 --> 00:58:02,900
I'll leave her in your care, whatever
happens. You understand? In your care.

596
00:58:07,600 --> 00:58:08,400
(angry shouting)

597
00:58:10,300 --> 00:58:14,600
Quiet! Quiet! Quiet!

598
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:16,600
Ludwig.

599
00:58:16,700 --> 00:58:20,100
You will search the woods.
Those are your group.

600
00:58:20,200 --> 00:58:23,400
- We'll get him!
- Quiet!

601
00:58:23,500 --> 00:58:25,400
Herr Frankenstein.

602
00:58:25,500 --> 00:58:29,600
You will take to the mountains.
Those are your people.

603
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:33,500
I... I will lead the third group by the lake.

604
00:58:34,200 --> 00:58:39,200
And remember... remember...
get him alive if you can,

605
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:41,600
but get him!

606
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:46,500
Quiet! Search every ravine,
every crevasse,

607
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:48,700
but the fiend must be found!

608
00:58:50,300 --> 00:58:52,500
Are you ready?

609
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:55,100
Light your torches and go!

610
01:00:00,300 --> 01:00:01,700
Stop!

611
01:00:01,700 --> 01:00:03,500
Frankenstein, mountains!

612
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,300
Ludwig!

613
01:00:05,400 --> 01:00:07,800
Lake party, this way!

614
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:48,900
Come on, boys! Keep together.

615
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,600
You search there.
The rest, come with me.

616
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,400
(yells)

617
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,400
Look lively! Come on! Come on!

618
01:01:12,100 --> 01:01:14,600
Herr Frankenstein! Herr Frankenstein!

619
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,900
(moaning)

620
01:01:20,900 --> 01:01:23,900
Come on, men! Quick! This way!

621
01:01:28,400 --> 01:01:32,100
Which way did he go?
Which way did he go? Tell me! Tell me!

622
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:33,400
Over there.

623
01:01:33,500 --> 01:01:35,600
You stay here and take care of him.

624
01:01:35,700 --> 01:01:39,100
The rest, follow me.
Come on! Come on, quick!

625
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:02,200
No, come back! This way.

626
01:02:15,300 --> 01:02:17,800
Herr Frankenstein!

627
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,200
Herr Frankenstein, where are you?

628
01:02:22,800 --> 01:02:25,900
I think he's up there. Come on, follow me.

629
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:27,900
Quick!

630
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:40,800
Hello!

631
01:02:47,600 --> 01:02:49,700
Fire. Fire!

632
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:53,800
Help! Help!

633
01:02:56,300 --> 01:02:58,900
- Listen.
- (Herr Frankenstein) Help!

634
01:02:59,000 --> 01:03:01,100
It's Frankenstein.

635
01:03:01,200 --> 01:03:03,300
That way!

636
01:03:27,400 --> 01:03:29,900
This way! Come on, hurry! Hurry!

637
01:03:32,700 --> 01:03:35,800
Look, they're there!
Turn the hounds loose!

638
01:04:46,300 --> 01:04:48,100
(yells)

639
01:05:02,700 --> 01:05:03,700
(yells)

640
01:05:25,100 --> 01:05:27,100
There he is! The murderer.

641
01:06:05,600 --> 01:06:07,300
He's alive.

642
01:06:07,400 --> 01:06:09,500
Frankenstein!

643
01:06:10,100 --> 01:06:12,100
Frankenstein.

644
01:06:14,300 --> 01:06:17,800
Bring him down to the village
and let's take him home.

645
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,800
Murderer!

646
01:06:27,700 --> 01:06:29,800
Burn the mill!

647
01:06:38,900 --> 01:06:41,800
Burn the mill! He can't get away!

648
01:06:50,100 --> 01:06:52,100
(screams)

649
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:16,200
(continues screaming)

650
01:07:25,300 --> 01:07:26,800
Aaagh!

651
01:07:33,100 --> 01:07:35,200
(hounds howling)

652
01:07:49,500 --> 01:07:52,400
Have you got it? Come on, hurry.

653
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,000
(whispering and giggling)

654
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:02,300
Quiet, quiet.

655
01:08:03,700 --> 01:08:06,100
Well, go ahead and knock.

656
01:08:12,600 --> 01:08:15,200
Well, well, well, what's all this?

657
01:08:15,300 --> 01:08:17,400
What do you want, hey?

658
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:19,400
What's this?

659
01:08:19,500 --> 01:08:21,400
If you please, Herr Baron,

660
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:26,500
we thought that Mr Henry could do with
a glass of his great-grandmother's wine.

661
01:08:26,600 --> 01:08:29,200
Fine old lady, my grandmother.

662
01:08:30,400 --> 01:08:35,100
Very foreseeing of her
to prevent my grandfather drinking this.

663
01:08:42,900 --> 01:08:45,300
Mr Henry doesn't need this.

664
01:08:47,100 --> 01:08:50,000
As I said before, I say again,

665
01:08:50,100 --> 01:08:54,600
here's to a son
to the House of Frankenstein.

666
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:57,500
(all) Yes, indeed, sir. We hope so, sir.
