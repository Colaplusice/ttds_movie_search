1
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:11,669
- The gentleman has not arrived?
- No, he has not.

2
00:00:11,765 --> 00:00:13,837
I'm afraid the dinner will be spoiled.

3
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:17,009
What difference does it make?
It's too late to dine now.

4
00:00:17,302 --> 00:00:21,956
Boy, will you page
Mr. Otis B. Driftwood, please?

5
00:00:25,921 --> 00:00:27,792
Paging Mr. Driftwood!

6
00:00:30,543 --> 00:00:32,082
Mr. Driftwood!

7
00:00:34,457 --> 00:00:37,654
Do me a favor and stop yelling my name
all over this restaurant.

8
00:00:37,746 --> 00:00:40,411
- Do I go around yelling your name?
- Mr. Driftwood!

9
00:00:40,494 --> 00:00:43,276
Is your voice changing,
or is somebody else paging me?

10
00:00:43,367 --> 00:00:46,860
- Mr. Driftwood!
- Why, Mrs. Claypool, hello!

11
00:00:46,948 --> 00:00:49,778
You invited me to dine with you at 7:00.

12
00:00:49,862 --> 00:00:52,017
It is now 8:00, and no dinner.

13
00:00:52,111 --> 00:00:55,107
No dinner? I just had
one of the biggest meals of my life...

14
00:00:55,192 --> 00:00:56,518
and no thanks to you, either.

15
00:00:56,608 --> 00:01:00,101
- I've been sitting right here since 7:00.
- With your back to me.

16
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:02,971
When I dine with a woman,
I expect her to look at my face.

17
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,176
- That's the price she has to pay.
- Your check, sir.

18
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:10,675
$9.40? This is an outrage!
If I were you, I wouldn't pay it.

19
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:16,251
- What are we gonna have for dinner?
- You've had your dinner.

20
00:01:16,343 --> 00:01:17,716
All right, we'll have breakfast.

21
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:19,174
- Waiter!
- Yes, sir.

22
00:01:19,258 --> 00:01:21,579
- Have you got any milk-fed chicken?
- Yes, sir.

23
00:01:21,673 --> 00:01:24,124
Squeeze the milk out of one
and bring me a glass.

24
00:01:24,213 --> 00:01:25,242
Yes, sir.

25
00:01:25,337 --> 00:01:28,949
Mr. Driftwood, three months ago,
you promised to put me into society.

26
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:32,571
In all that time, you've done nothing
but draw a very handsome salary.

27
00:01:32,665 --> 00:01:36,703
You think that's nothing? How many men
do you think draw a handsome salary?

28
00:01:36,787 --> 00:01:39,783
You can count them on the fingers
of one hand, my good woman.

29
00:01:39,868 --> 00:01:42,734
- I'm not your good woman!
- Don't say that, Mrs. Claypool.

30
00:01:42,824 --> 00:01:44,565
I don't care what your past has been.

31
00:01:44,656 --> 00:01:47,936
To me, you'll always be my good woman,
because I love you.

32
00:01:48,029 --> 00:01:51,392
There. I didn't mean to tell you
but you dragged it out of me.

33
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,728
I love you.

34
00:01:52,817 --> 00:01:56,015
That's hard to believe when I find you
dining with another woman.

35
00:01:56,106 --> 00:01:59,019
That woman?
Do you know why I sat with her?

36
00:01:59,104 --> 00:02:01,472
Because she reminded me of you.

37
00:02:01,727 --> 00:02:03,633
- Really?
- Of course.

38
00:02:03,893 --> 00:02:07,386
That's why I'm here with you,
because you remind me of you.

39
00:02:07,473 --> 00:02:12,044
Your eyes, your throat, your lips...
Everything about you reminds me of you...

40
00:02:12,137 --> 00:02:13,297
except you.

41
00:02:13,386 --> 00:02:16,831
How do you account for that?
She figures that out, she's good.

42
00:02:16,925 --> 00:02:20,501
Mr. Driftwood, I think we'd better
keep everything on a business basis.

43
00:02:20,589 --> 00:02:24,366
Every time I get romantic with you,
you want to talk business.

44
00:02:24,753 --> 00:02:29,241
I don't know. There's something about me
that brings out the business in all women.

45
00:02:29,791 --> 00:02:33,201
All right, we'll talk business.
You see that man eating spaghetti?

46
00:02:33,288 --> 00:02:36,035
- No.
- You see the spaghetti, don't you?

47
00:02:36,286 --> 00:02:39,198
Behind that spaghetti
is none other than Herman Gottlieb...

48
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:41,361
director of the New York Opera Company.

49
00:02:41,449 --> 00:02:43,237
- Do you follow me?
- Yes.

50
00:02:43,323 --> 00:02:45,644
Stop following me,
or I'll have you arrested!

51
00:02:45,737 --> 00:02:49,432
I've arranged for you to invest $200,000
in the New York Opera Company.

52
00:02:49,526 --> 00:02:50,639
I don't understand.

53
00:02:50,734 --> 00:02:52,806
Don't you see?
You'll be a patron of the opera.

54
00:02:52,899 --> 00:02:54,272
You'll get into society.

55
00:02:54,356 --> 00:02:57,021
You can marry me,
and they'll kick you out of society...

56
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:59,342
and all you've lost is $200,000.

57
00:03:01,684 --> 00:03:03,473
Gottlieb. Allow me.

58
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:05,677
Mrs. Claypool, Mr. Gottlieb.

59
00:03:10,636 --> 00:03:13,383
I could go on all night,
but it's tough on my suspenders.

60
00:03:13,468 --> 00:03:14,924
Where was I?

61
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:20,120
What are you doing?

62
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:24,120
If you four people want to play bridge,
don't mind me, go right ahead.

63
00:03:24,293 --> 00:03:26,531
Mrs. Claypool, I'm so happy.

64
00:03:28,498 --> 00:03:31,494
I just wanted to see
if your rings were still there.

65
00:03:31,954 --> 00:03:34,239
You're as charming as you are beautiful.

66
00:03:34,328 --> 00:03:37,158
I'm afraid you've used
that speech before, Mr. Gottlieb.

67
00:03:37,242 --> 00:03:40,771
Now listen here, Gottlieb,
making love to Mrs. Claypool is my racket.

68
00:03:40,865 --> 00:03:42,901
What you're after is $200,000.

69
00:03:44,196 --> 00:03:47,144
Make it sound plausible,
because incredible as it may seem...

70
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,935
Mrs. Claypool isn't as big a sap
as she looks.

71
00:03:50,066 --> 00:03:52,020
How's that for lovemaking?

72
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:54,392
I think the Europeans do it better.

73
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,511
All right, Gottlieb, it's your turn.
You take a whack at her...

74
00:03:57,603 --> 00:03:59,059
and keep it clean.

75
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:03,470
Mrs. Claypool, it is most generous
of you to help us.

76
00:04:03,848 --> 00:04:07,294
Now, you have, of course,
heard of Rodolfo Lassparri.

77
00:04:07,387 --> 00:04:10,964
- Of course.
- He is the greatest tenor since Caruso.

78
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:15,165
Tonight, with the money
you so generously provide...

79
00:04:15,257 --> 00:04:18,252
I sign Lassparri for the Opera Company.

80
00:04:18,338 --> 00:04:21,996
He will be a sensation.
All New York will be at your feet.

81
00:04:22,085 --> 00:04:23,991
There's plenty of room.

82
00:04:24,708 --> 00:04:26,911
And now, the opera awaits us.

83
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:29,906
If you both will honor me
by occupying my box.

84
00:04:29,996 --> 00:04:31,369
I should be charmed.

85
00:04:31,453 --> 00:04:34,153
- And you, Mr. Driftwood?
- I'll join up with you later.

86
00:04:34,243 --> 00:04:38,151
Listen, Gottlieb, nix on the lovemaking,
because I saw Mrs. Claypool first.

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,278
Of course, her mother really saw her first,
but why bring the CiviI War into this?

88
00:05:05,470 --> 00:05:07,341
What are you doing in my costume?

89
00:05:07,427 --> 00:05:10,376
Take it off at once, do you hear?
Lmmediately.

90
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:15,376
Why, you...

91
00:05:19,877 --> 00:05:21,416
Take that off.

92
00:05:29,037 --> 00:05:31,903
Take off that dress, do you hear me?
You dumb idiot.

93
00:05:31,993 --> 00:05:34,658
You do what I say, or I'll break your neck!

94
00:05:38,197 --> 00:05:40,684
Do you hear me? Take off that dress.

95
00:05:41,112 --> 00:05:44,640
If I get my hands on you,
you'll never hear the end of this!

96
00:05:44,734 --> 00:05:47,932
You're no longer my dresser,
you're fired! Get out!

97
00:05:48,398 --> 00:05:52,259
Get out, do you hear me? Out you go.
And don't come back in here again.

98
00:06:01,763 --> 00:06:04,878
Don't you care.
You're lucky to be rid of him.

99
00:06:09,841 --> 00:06:11,877
- Good evening, Rosa.
- Good evening, slgnore.

100
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:15,576
Tomasso, why don't you come in?
I've been waiting for you.

101
00:06:21,791 --> 00:06:24,870
Are they not beautiful, slgnorlna?
From Slgnor Lassparri.

102
00:06:24,955 --> 00:06:28,448
I wouldn't wear them
if they were the only flowers in the world.

103
00:06:28,536 --> 00:06:31,650
- Come in!
- Not if you use that tone.

104
00:06:32,241 --> 00:06:36,315
Let's try the whole thing all over again.
Only this time, try to be more cordial.

105
00:06:37,987 --> 00:06:40,983
- Come in.
- That's better. Let's try it once more.

106
00:06:41,068 --> 00:06:43,353
No, Ricky. You're such a fool.

107
00:06:44,524 --> 00:06:48,018
- What was it you wanted to see me about?
- I suppose I sent for you?

108
00:06:48,105 --> 00:06:50,224
You meant to. Didn't she, Marie?

109
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:55,380
It's the last night of the season,
and I'm more in love with you than ever.

110
00:06:55,475 --> 00:06:59,418
- What will you do about it?
- We have all summer to talk that over.

111
00:06:59,514 --> 00:07:03,256
- Tonight, we have to sing an opera.
- You have to sing an opera.

112
00:07:03,802 --> 00:07:06,668
- I'm nothing but a glorified chorus man.
- Don't say that.

113
00:07:06,758 --> 00:07:10,038
I've got to say it.
I've got something else to say.

114
00:07:10,422 --> 00:07:14,117
What are you doing tonight,
unless that ham Lassparri asked you first.

115
00:07:14,211 --> 00:07:16,828
- He has asked me first.
- Just my luck.

116
00:07:17,334 --> 00:07:19,738
But I'm having supper with you, Riccardo.

117
00:07:19,832 --> 00:07:23,030
Hooray! We'll have champagne,
music, flowers...

118
00:07:25,079 --> 00:07:26,405
"Lassparri."

119
00:07:27,285 --> 00:07:28,658
No flowers.

120
00:07:32,615 --> 00:07:35,184
- Fiorello!
- Tony!

121
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,270
- Where have you been all these weeks?
- Here, there, different places.

122
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,521
- Got some maiI for me?
- MaiI for you? You don't work here.

123
00:07:42,608 --> 00:07:45,520
Where am I gonna get my maiI?
I no work anyplace.

124
00:07:48,895 --> 00:07:50,138
Tomasso!

125
00:07:59,637 --> 00:08:02,171
Not so good. Don't be so glad.

126
00:08:02,926 --> 00:08:06,503
I brought you present.
You got something for me, too?

127
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,165
What do you got?

128
00:08:09,796 --> 00:08:12,330
Where's Riccardo? All right.

129
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,066
What are you doing here?
I thought you were with the circus.

130
00:08:38,151 --> 00:08:40,187
The circus? When was I with the circus?

131
00:08:40,275 --> 00:08:43,638
I nearly forgot.
That was a long time ago, last week.

132
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,803
Since then I have lots ofjobs.

133
00:08:45,895 --> 00:08:47,684
Your piano and my voice.

134
00:08:47,769 --> 00:08:51,298
All those years we studied at
the conservatory, and what's come of it?

135
00:08:51,392 --> 00:08:55,217
What's a matter with you?
We're still young. We've got our health.

136
00:08:59,011 --> 00:09:03,298
You hear that? Someday, Riccardo,
you're gonna be where Lassparri is.

137
00:09:03,591 --> 00:09:06,540
When you were six years old,
you sing better than Lassparri.

138
00:09:06,631 --> 00:09:08,952
Maybe I was better at six than I am now.

139
00:09:09,046 --> 00:09:10,999
You make me sick. You crazy.

140
00:09:11,086 --> 00:09:13,786
You sing better than he ever could sing
and you know it.

141
00:09:13,875 --> 00:09:16,741
I know it and you know it,
but the public doesn't know it.

142
00:09:16,832 --> 00:09:18,986
- All right. We tell the public.
- How?

143
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,820
What you need is a manager.

144
00:09:20,995 --> 00:09:23,991
A wise guy, somebody who's very smart.

145
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:28,483
- I knowjust the man for you.
- You do? Who is it?

146
00:09:28,573 --> 00:09:29,651
Me!

147
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,193
- But you wouldn't make any money at it.
- I'll break even.

148
00:09:33,278 --> 00:09:35,646
Just as long as I no lose nothing.

149
00:09:39,524 --> 00:09:42,603
- Is the opera over yet?
- Not yet, slgnore, in a few minutes.

150
00:09:42,688 --> 00:09:44,642
I told you to slow that nag down.

151
00:09:44,728 --> 00:09:46,966
On account of you,
I nearly heard the opera.

152
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:50,719
Once around the park, and drive slowly.
And none of your back talk.

153
00:10:02,049 --> 00:10:04,287
You're still crazy about her?

154
00:10:04,381 --> 00:10:06,335
And she's crazy about you, too?

155
00:10:06,421 --> 00:10:08,955
Even if she was,
I couldn't ask her to marry me.

156
00:10:09,044 --> 00:10:12,123
Don't worry.
The manager, he'll fix everything.

157
00:10:12,333 --> 00:10:14,122
Anyhow, we're together again...

158
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:17,617
- you and me, just like old times.
- Yeah, like old times.

159
00:10:17,705 --> 00:10:19,575
Yeah, you bet my life.

160
00:10:33,485 --> 00:10:35,723
If you pardon my saying so,
Mrs. Claypool...

161
00:10:35,817 --> 00:10:39,854
Mr. Driftwood seems hardly the person
to handle your business affairs.

162
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:42,887
- I'm beginning to think the same thing.
- Bravo!

163
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:46,257
I made it.
How soon does the curtain go up?

164
00:10:46,351 --> 00:10:49,216
The curtain, Mr. Driftwood,
will go up again next season.

165
00:10:49,307 --> 00:10:53,345
- You've missed the entire opera.
- I only missed it by a few minutes.

166
00:10:53,637 --> 00:10:55,177
I can go then?

167
00:10:55,261 --> 00:10:59,204
Was I right? Isn't Lassparri
the greatest tenor that ever lived?

168
00:10:59,300 --> 00:11:02,212
He's superb.
But what would you have to pay him?

169
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,624
What's the difference?

170
00:11:03,713 --> 00:11:06,460
He must saiI with us tomorrow
no matter what we pay.

171
00:11:06,544 --> 00:11:09,375
- He would be worth $1,000 a night.
- How much?

172
00:11:11,666 --> 00:11:14,034
- What does he do?
- What does he do, he sings.

173
00:11:14,122 --> 00:11:16,988
You're willing to pay him
$1,000 a night just for singing?

174
00:11:17,079 --> 00:11:20,691
You can get a phonograph record
of Minnie the Moocher for 75 cents.

175
00:11:20,784 --> 00:11:23,353
For $1.25, you can get Minnie.

176
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:25,604
If you'll excuse me, Mrs. Claypool...

177
00:11:25,697 --> 00:11:28,693
I think I had better arrange
to see Lassparri immediately.

178
00:11:28,778 --> 00:11:31,644
- You are agreed, $1,000 a night?
- Just as you think.

179
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:34,482
$1,000. There must be some way
I can get a piece of this.

180
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:38,178
Wait. Why don't I sign Lassparri?
I represent Mrs. Claypool.

181
00:11:38,272 --> 00:11:40,640
But I represent
the New York Opera Company.

182
00:11:40,728 --> 00:11:44,174
Boy? Will you give my card
to Slgnor Lassparri, please?

183
00:12:00,006 --> 00:12:02,244
What is it? What do you want?

184
00:12:16,494 --> 00:12:18,649
- Rosa.
- Yes, slgnore?

185
00:12:19,659 --> 00:12:22,738
My good friend Herman Gottlieb
is coming back to see me.

186
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:24,859
How would you like
to have supper with us?

187
00:12:24,946 --> 00:12:28,523
I'm terribly sorry, Slgnor Lassparri,
I already have an engagement.

188
00:12:28,611 --> 00:12:29,771
I see.

189
00:12:30,526 --> 00:12:32,598
That's too bad, because I have an idea...

190
00:12:32,691 --> 00:12:35,557
he's going to invite me
to sing in New York.

191
00:12:35,855 --> 00:12:39,763
And he may permit me
to select my leading lady.

192
00:12:40,893 --> 00:12:43,889
Are you sure
you can't break your appointment?

193
00:12:45,182 --> 00:12:47,301
I'm terribly sorry, slgnore.

194
00:12:58,298 --> 00:13:01,293
What do you mean by humiliating me
in front of those people?

195
00:13:01,379 --> 00:13:03,451
You're fired, do you understand?

196
00:13:03,544 --> 00:13:06,077
You big bully,
why are you hitting that little bully?

197
00:13:06,167 --> 00:13:08,286
Will you kindly let me
handle my own affairs?

198
00:13:08,374 --> 00:13:11,239
Get out. What do you got to say to me?

199
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:15,107
Can you sleep on your stomach
with such big buttons on your pajamas?

200
00:13:15,535 --> 00:13:17,027
Why, you...

201
00:13:20,615 --> 00:13:22,936
Nice work, I think you got him.

202
00:13:23,071 --> 00:13:25,937
Smelling salts. That will bring him to.

203
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:30,354
You're sorry for what you did?
That shows a nice spirit.

204
00:13:31,940 --> 00:13:34,770
Now he's coming along. He'll be fine now.

205
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:43,263
- Get fresh with me, huh?
- How do you do?

206
00:13:43,432 --> 00:13:45,965
- Hello.
- What's the matter, mister?

207
00:13:46,055 --> 00:13:49,418
We had an argument.
He pulled a knife on me, so I shot him.

208
00:13:49,511 --> 00:13:52,921
- Do you mind if I...
- Go right ahead. Plenty of room.

209
00:13:53,841 --> 00:13:57,002
- Two beers, bartender.
- I'll take two beers, too.

210
00:13:57,588 --> 00:13:59,992
Things seem to be getting better
around the country.

211
00:14:00,086 --> 00:14:02,490
I don't know. I'm a stranger here myself.

212
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:07,152
I came back here looking for somebody.
You don't know who it is, do you?

213
00:14:07,248 --> 00:14:09,913
It's a funny thing, it just slipped my mind.

214
00:14:09,996 --> 00:14:13,655
I know. The greatest tenor in the world.
That's what I'm after.

215
00:14:13,743 --> 00:14:15,946
- Why, I'm his manager.
- Whose manager?

216
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,857
The greatest tenor in the world.

217
00:14:17,949 --> 00:14:20,980
- The fellow that sings at the opera here?
- Sure.

218
00:14:22,112 --> 00:14:23,391
What's his name?

219
00:14:23,486 --> 00:14:27,228
What do you care? I can't pronounce it.
What do you want with him?

220
00:14:27,483 --> 00:14:30,811
I want to sign him up
for the New York Opera Company.

221
00:14:30,981 --> 00:14:33,515
Do you know that America is waiting
to hear him sing?

222
00:14:33,604 --> 00:14:36,553
He can sing loud
but he can't sing that loud.

223
00:14:37,268 --> 00:14:40,217
I think I can get America
to meet him halfway.

224
00:14:40,308 --> 00:14:41,634
Could he saiI tomorrow?

225
00:14:41,723 --> 00:14:44,388
You pay him enough money,
he could saiI yesterday.

226
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:45,880
How much you pay him?

227
00:14:45,970 --> 00:14:49,499
I don't know. Let's see, $1,000 a night.

228
00:14:50,384 --> 00:14:52,705
I'm entitled to a small profit.

229
00:14:53,298 --> 00:14:55,998
- How about $10 a night?
- $10?

230
00:14:57,837 --> 00:14:59,245
I'll take it.

231
00:15:01,334 --> 00:15:04,247
All right, but remember,
I get 10% for negotiating the deal.

232
00:15:04,332 --> 00:15:07,198
Yes, and I get 10% for being the manager.

233
00:15:07,413 --> 00:15:08,905
How much does that leave?

234
00:15:08,995 --> 00:15:12,654
Well, that leaves him $8.

235
00:15:14,075 --> 00:15:17,273
- He sends $5 home to his mother.
- That leaves $3.

236
00:15:18,197 --> 00:15:20,270
Can he live in New York on $3?

237
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:21,605
Like a prince.

238
00:15:21,695 --> 00:15:24,974
Of course, he won't be able to eat,
but he can live like a prince.

239
00:15:25,067 --> 00:15:28,477
However, out of that $3,
he'll have to pay an income tax.

240
00:15:28,773 --> 00:15:32,515
Yes, there's a federal tax, a state tax,
and a city tax...

241
00:15:32,812 --> 00:15:35,050
a street tax, and a sewer tax.

242
00:15:35,143 --> 00:15:36,683
How much does this come to?

243
00:15:36,767 --> 00:15:39,846
I figure if he doesn't sing too often,
he can break even.

244
00:15:39,931 --> 00:15:42,632
- All right, we take it.
- All right, fine.

245
00:15:42,721 --> 00:15:44,261
Here are the contracts.

246
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:47,874
You just put his name at the top,
and you sign at the bottom.

247
00:15:47,967 --> 00:15:50,798
No need of you reading that
because these are duplicates.

248
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:52,622
Yeah. Is a duplicate.

249
00:15:55,046 --> 00:15:57,414
- Duplicates?
- I say, they're duplicates.

250
00:15:59,209 --> 00:16:03,614
- Don't you know what duplicates are?
- Sure, those five kids up in Canada.

251
00:16:06,121 --> 00:16:09,484
I wouldn't know about that.
I haven't been in Canada in years.

252
00:16:10,868 --> 00:16:12,656
Go ahead and read it.

253
00:16:14,573 --> 00:16:17,273
- What does it say?
- Go on and read it.

254
00:16:17,779 --> 00:16:20,775
- You read it.
- All right, I'll read it to you.

255
00:16:23,025 --> 00:16:25,856
- Can you hear?
- I haven't heard anything yet.

256
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:30,218
- You say anything?
- I haven't said anything worth hearing.

257
00:16:30,395 --> 00:16:32,431
That's why I didn't hear anything.

258
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:34,887
That's why I didn't say anything.

259
00:16:42,012 --> 00:16:45,340
- Can you read?
- I can read, but I can't see it.

260
00:16:47,799 --> 00:16:50,333
Don't seem to have it in focus here.

261
00:16:52,921 --> 00:16:55,870
If my arms were a little longer,
I could read it.

262
00:16:55,960 --> 00:16:58,577
You haven't got a baboon
in your pocket, have you?

263
00:16:58,667 --> 00:17:00,869
Here we are. Now I've got it.

264
00:17:01,831 --> 00:17:06,319
Pay particular attention to this first clause
because it's most important.

265
00:17:07,535 --> 00:17:11,064
It says, "The party of the first part
shall be known in this contract...

266
00:17:11,158 --> 00:17:13,230
"as the party of the first part."

267
00:17:13,323 --> 00:17:15,442
How do you like that?
That's pretty neat, eh?

268
00:17:15,529 --> 00:17:17,151
No, it's no good.

269
00:17:17,736 --> 00:17:21,597
- What's the matter with it?
- I don't know. Let's hear it again.

270
00:17:23,399 --> 00:17:26,560
"The party of the first part
shall be known in this contract...

271
00:17:26,646 --> 00:17:28,636
"as the party of the first part."

272
00:17:30,061 --> 00:17:32,429
Sounds a little better this time.

273
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,046
It grows on you.
Would you like to hear it once more?

274
00:17:35,140 --> 00:17:36,881
Just the first part.

275
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:39,051
What? "The party of the first part"?

276
00:17:39,137 --> 00:17:42,382
No. The first part
of "the party of the first part."

277
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:48,995
It says, "The first part
of the party of the first part...

278
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:52,534
"shall be known in this contract
as the first part of the party...

279
00:17:52,628 --> 00:17:54,333
"Shall be known in this contract..."

280
00:17:54,418 --> 00:17:57,165
Why should we quarrel about this?
We'll take it out.

281
00:17:57,249 --> 00:17:59,322
Yeah. It's too long anyhow.

282
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:02,493
Now what do we got left?

283
00:18:02,579 --> 00:18:04,782
I got about a foot and a half.

284
00:18:06,909 --> 00:18:10,486
It says, "The party of the second part
shall be known in this contract...

285
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:12,195
"as the party of the second part."

286
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:14,234
I don't know about that.

287
00:18:15,028 --> 00:18:18,474
- Now what's the matter?
- I don't like the second party either.

288
00:18:18,567 --> 00:18:22,688
You should have come to the first party.
We didn't get home till around 4:00 a. m.

289
00:18:22,773 --> 00:18:24,845
I was blind for three days.

290
00:18:25,313 --> 00:18:28,013
Why can't the first part
of the second party...

291
00:18:28,102 --> 00:18:31,133
be the second part of the first party?
Then you got something.

292
00:18:31,225 --> 00:18:34,221
Look, rather than go through that again,
what do you say...

293
00:18:34,306 --> 00:18:35,384
Fine.

294
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:39,876
I've got something you're bound to like.
You'll be crazy about it.

295
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,342
No. I don't like it.

296
00:18:41,426 --> 00:18:44,043
- You don't like what?
- Whatever it is, I don't like it.

297
00:18:44,132 --> 00:18:47,578
Don't let's break up an old friendship
over a thing like that. Ready?

298
00:18:47,672 --> 00:18:48,749
Okay.

299
00:18:50,794 --> 00:18:53,281
The next part,
I don't think you're going to like.

300
00:18:53,376 --> 00:18:57,070
Your word's good enough for me.
Is my word good enough for you?

301
00:18:57,165 --> 00:19:00,445
- I should say not.
- That takes out two more clauses.

302
00:19:02,786 --> 00:19:05,865
- "The party of the eighth part..."
- No, that's no good.

303
00:19:06,158 --> 00:19:09,652
- "The party of the ninth..."
- No, that's no good, too.

304
00:19:10,322 --> 00:19:12,891
How is it my contract
is skinnier than yours?

305
00:19:12,987 --> 00:19:16,148
I don't know, you must have been out
on a tear last night.

306
00:19:16,234 --> 00:19:18,389
- We're all set now, aren't we?
- Sure.

307
00:19:18,483 --> 00:19:22,853
Just you put your name down there,
and then the deal is legal.

308
00:19:23,063 --> 00:19:24,887
I forgot to tell you, I can't write.

309
00:19:24,978 --> 00:19:27,299
That's all right, there's no ink in the pen.

310
00:19:27,393 --> 00:19:29,299
- But it's a contract, isn't it?
- Sure.

311
00:19:29,392 --> 00:19:31,760
We've got a contract,
no matter how small it is.

312
00:19:31,848 --> 00:19:34,678
Wait. What does this say here?

313
00:19:34,763 --> 00:19:38,291
That? That's the usual clause.
That's in every contract.

314
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:42,246
That just says, "If any of the parties...

315
00:19:42,341 --> 00:19:44,081
"participating in this contract...

316
00:19:44,173 --> 00:19:46,209
"are shown not to be in their right mind...

317
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:49,411
"the entire agreement
is automatically nullified."

318
00:19:49,752 --> 00:19:51,208
I don't know.

319
00:19:51,293 --> 00:19:53,614
It's all right. That's in every contract.

320
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:56,324
That's what they call a sanity clause.

321
00:19:57,205 --> 00:20:00,236
You can't fool me.
There ain't no Sanity Claus.

322
00:20:00,911 --> 00:20:03,030
You win the white carnation.

323
00:20:03,284 --> 00:20:05,901
- I'll give this to Riccardo.
... sensation in New York.

324
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:08,110
Could you tell me
where Slgnor Lassparri is?

325
00:20:08,197 --> 00:20:09,902
Sure. There's Lassparri.

326
00:20:11,570 --> 00:20:13,606
Lassparri? Then whom did I sign?

327
00:20:13,693 --> 00:20:16,227
You signed Riccardo Baroni.
That's my man.

328
00:20:16,316 --> 00:20:18,222
Slgnor Lassparri, what happened?

329
00:20:18,315 --> 00:20:20,802
Speak to me. It's me, it's Gottlieb.

330
00:20:23,894 --> 00:20:25,551
What is this now?

331
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,720
How early the fruit is falling this season.

332
00:20:41,631 --> 00:20:45,752
- Are you sure you have everything, Otis?
- I've never had any complaints yet.

333
00:20:48,252 --> 00:20:51,449
Here you are,
on your way to America and fame.

334
00:20:51,541 --> 00:20:54,655
Riccardo, I'm going to miss you.

335
00:20:55,038 --> 00:20:56,779
How do you think I feel about it?

336
00:20:56,954 --> 00:20:59,440
Miss Castaldi, ready for the big trip?

337
00:20:59,535 --> 00:21:03,361
Mr. Gottlieb. This is Riccardo Baroni
of the Opera Company.

338
00:21:03,699 --> 00:21:06,695
- How do you do?
- Did you say Baroni?

339
00:21:08,196 --> 00:21:09,604
Is it as funny as all that?

340
00:21:09,695 --> 00:21:12,856
Mr. Otis B. Driftwood seems to think
you have quite a voice.

341
00:21:12,942 --> 00:21:16,436
He has, Mr. Gottlieb, really he has,
a wonderful voice.

342
00:21:16,523 --> 00:21:18,974
- Yes, really I have.
- That's interesting.

343
00:21:26,058 --> 00:21:28,343
- Come on, Riccardo.
- No, thanks.

344
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:31,095
Come on, Ricky!

345
00:21:43,171 --> 00:21:45,207
- Slgnor Lassparri.
- Yes?

346
00:21:45,336 --> 00:21:48,166
- Will you give us a farewell song?
- Please!

347
00:21:49,125 --> 00:21:50,154
Come on!

348
00:21:50,249 --> 00:21:53,529
My dear friends,
I am so sorry, I must be excused...

349
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,660
but I have a slight touch of laryngitis.

350
00:21:56,869 --> 00:21:58,905
- Where's Rosa?
- Yes, Rosa!

351
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:04,814
Why should I sing for them
when I'm not being paid for it?

352
00:22:06,445 --> 00:22:08,565
- Please sing.
- No.

353
00:22:12,524 --> 00:22:14,478
Yes, of course I'll sing.

354
00:24:39,794 --> 00:24:41,072
Mr. Gottlieb.

355
00:24:41,792 --> 00:24:43,616
Hasn't he a wonderful voice?

356
00:24:44,166 --> 00:24:46,404
There must be a place for him
in New York.

357
00:24:46,497 --> 00:24:48,037
Not a bad voice.

358
00:24:48,579 --> 00:24:51,658
Someday, perhaps,
when he has made a reputation.

359
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,841
All visitors ashore!

360
00:25:20,889 --> 00:25:22,002
Rosa!

361
00:25:26,926 --> 00:25:28,832
We've come to say goodbye.

362
00:25:30,549 --> 00:25:32,503
All right. Goodbye. Arrlvedercl.

363
00:25:32,589 --> 00:25:33,997
Come on!

364
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,967
- All right, take it away.
- Yes, sir.

365
00:26:14,143 --> 00:26:16,594
Have I got time to go back
and pay my hotel bill?

366
00:26:16,682 --> 00:26:18,920
- Sorry. Too late.
- That suits me fine.

367
00:26:39,957 --> 00:26:41,993
That's mine. A trunk thief?

368
00:26:42,081 --> 00:26:44,484
- Where you going with that?
- Suite number 58, sir.

369
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:47,326
Fifty-eight? That's me. Let's go.

370
00:26:52,698 --> 00:26:55,647
What's the idea? Hit-and-run driver?

371
00:26:55,738 --> 00:26:56,934
I'm sorry, sir.

372
00:26:57,028 --> 00:27:00,971
Sorry, my eye. Look at that fender.
It's all bumped out of shape.

373
00:27:01,067 --> 00:27:04,098
You'll pay for this, my good man.
Let me see your number.

374
00:27:04,190 --> 00:27:06,428
Thirty-two? You got any insurance?

375
00:27:06,813 --> 00:27:08,719
- What?
- Are you insured?

376
00:27:09,311 --> 00:27:11,596
- No, sir.
- You're just the fellow I want to see.

377
00:27:11,685 --> 00:27:14,929
I have an accident policy that protects you
no matter what happens.

378
00:27:15,016 --> 00:27:18,260
If you lose a leg, we'll look for it.
All this will cost you is...

379
00:27:18,346 --> 00:27:21,875
What have you got there?
$1. Here you are.

380
00:27:26,133 --> 00:27:27,162
Let's go.

381
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,540
Suite 58,
and don't go over 20 miles an hour.

382
00:27:39,789 --> 00:27:43,069
Say, was that three fellows
or one fellow with three beards?

383
00:27:45,244 --> 00:27:47,909
Hi, Gottlieb,
always beating around the bush.

384
00:27:51,406 --> 00:27:52,898
Wait a minute.

385
00:28:00,691 --> 00:28:02,348
Anything I can do?

386
00:28:05,146 --> 00:28:07,182
- Just a little homesick.
- That's funny.

387
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:10,928
I happen to have the greatest prescription
for homesickness you ever saw.

388
00:28:11,017 --> 00:28:13,504
A fellow gave it to me
just before the boat sailed.

389
00:28:13,598 --> 00:28:17,672
Here's the prescription,
and take it every two hours.

390
00:28:24,549 --> 00:28:27,036
I'm going out
and getting another prescription.

391
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:41,533
- Hello, toots.
- Hello.

392
00:28:41,870 --> 00:28:45,446
- Say, pretty classy layout you got here.
- Do you like it?

393
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:49,103
Twin beds. You little rascal, you.

394
00:28:50,197 --> 00:28:53,063
- One of those is a day bed.
- A likely story.

395
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,477
Have you read any good books lately?

396
00:28:55,568 --> 00:28:58,683
Mr. Driftwood,
will you please get off the bed?

397
00:28:59,024 --> 00:29:02,139
- What would people say?
- They'd say you're a very lucky woman.

398
00:29:02,230 --> 00:29:04,551
Will you please shut up
so I can continue reading?

399
00:29:04,645 --> 00:29:07,511
No, I will not shut up.
And will you kindly get up at once?

400
00:29:07,601 --> 00:29:10,135
All right, I'll go.
I'll make you another proposition.

401
00:29:10,224 --> 00:29:12,379
Let's go in my room
and discuss the situation.

402
00:29:12,473 --> 00:29:15,173
- What situation?
- What situations have you got?

403
00:29:15,262 --> 00:29:19,123
- I most certainly will not go to your room.
- Okay. Then I'll stay here.

404
00:29:23,298 --> 00:29:24,790
All right.

405
00:29:26,754 --> 00:29:28,625
I'll come, but get out.

406
00:29:29,044 --> 00:29:31,791
Shall we say 10 minutes?

407
00:29:32,125 --> 00:29:34,577
Yes, 10 minutes. Anything, but go.

408
00:29:34,665 --> 00:29:38,443
Because if you're not there in 10 minutes,
I'll be back here in 11.

409
00:29:38,537 --> 00:29:40,361
With squeaky shoes on.

410
00:29:53,152 --> 00:29:57,225
- Wait a minute. This can't be my room.
- Yes, sir.

411
00:29:57,607 --> 00:29:59,147
Suite number 58, sir.

412
00:29:59,231 --> 00:30:03,269
Fifty-eight? That's an awful big number
for a birdcage this size.

413
00:30:03,561 --> 00:30:06,924
Wouldn't it be simpler
if you just put the stateroom in the trunk?

414
00:30:07,017 --> 00:30:10,510
Say, who is responsible for installing me
in this telephone booth?

415
00:30:10,598 --> 00:30:12,552
Mr. Gottlieb picked it out for you, sir.

416
00:30:12,638 --> 00:30:16,001
Gottlieb? That's awfully decent of him.
Awfully decent.

417
00:30:16,219 --> 00:30:18,670
Did he pick out the whole room
orjust the porthole?

418
00:30:18,759 --> 00:30:22,501
- I'm sure you'll find it cozy, sir.
- Cozy is hardly the word.

419
00:30:22,589 --> 00:30:23,915
Anything else, sir?

420
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:26,705
Yes. Tomorrow you can take the trunk out
and I'll go in.

421
00:30:26,794 --> 00:30:28,037
Yes, sir.

422
00:30:48,779 --> 00:30:51,644
- Hello, boss. What are you doing here?
- Hello.

423
00:30:51,735 --> 00:30:53,641
This makes it a perfect voyage.

424
00:30:53,733 --> 00:30:57,227
- I'm sorry. I thought this was my trunk.
- It is your trunk.

425
00:30:57,314 --> 00:30:58,889
I don't remember packing you boys.

426
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,727
Remember Riccardo Baroni,
the greatest tenor in the world?

427
00:31:01,811 --> 00:31:03,219
You nearly signed him up once.

428
00:31:03,310 --> 00:31:05,761
Sure. I just delivered a letter for you.
How are you?

429
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:08,550
- Good. Just a little cramped.
- We're still in the harbor.

430
00:31:08,639 --> 00:31:11,671
As soon as we get out in the ocean,
there'll be plenty of room.

431
00:31:11,762 --> 00:31:14,545
- Isn't that my shirt?
- I don't know. I found it in the trunk.

432
00:31:14,635 --> 00:31:17,122
Then it couldn't be mine.
It's nice seeing you again.

433
00:31:17,217 --> 00:31:19,668
But I was expecting my other suit.
Did you see it?

434
00:31:19,756 --> 00:31:22,078
Yeah. Took up too much room,
so we sold it.

435
00:31:22,171 --> 00:31:24,493
- Did you get anything for it?
- $1.40.

436
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:28,826
That's my suit, all right. Say, it's lucky
I left another shirt in this drawer.

437
00:31:34,371 --> 00:31:37,485
That can't be my shirt.
My shirt doesn't snore.

438
00:31:37,577 --> 00:31:40,691
Don't wake him up. He's got insomnia.
He's sleeping it off.

439
00:31:40,783 --> 00:31:43,530
That's as grisly a looking object
as I've ever seen.

440
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:45,319
Get him up out of there.

441
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:52,646
He certainly is sleeping.

442
00:31:55,439 --> 00:31:58,008
I wish you fellows
would explain this thing to me.

443
00:31:58,104 --> 00:32:01,016
It's very simple.
You see, Riccardo, he's in love with Rosa.

444
00:32:01,102 --> 00:32:03,766
Rosa, she go to New York.
We want to go to New York, too.

445
00:32:03,850 --> 00:32:06,004
But we got no money,
so we hide in the trunk.

446
00:32:06,098 --> 00:32:08,052
Without money,
what'll you do in New York?

447
00:32:08,138 --> 00:32:10,376
I can sing. There must be
some place for me to work.

448
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,838
Besides, I can be near Rosa.
That's the main thing.

449
00:32:12,927 --> 00:32:14,667
You won't give us away, will you?

450
00:32:14,759 --> 00:32:16,997
No, but you fellows
have got to get out of here.

451
00:32:17,090 --> 00:32:19,494
I've got a date with a lady
in a few minutes...

452
00:32:19,588 --> 00:32:22,620
and you know the old saying:
"Two's company, five's a crowd."

453
00:32:22,711 --> 00:32:26,205
We go, but we want something to eat.
We no eat all day. We're hungry.

454
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:28,198
We'll discuss the food situation later.

455
00:32:28,291 --> 00:32:30,445
We get food, or we don't go.

456
00:32:30,955 --> 00:32:33,158
I know I never should have
met you fellows.

457
00:32:33,245 --> 00:32:35,732
Okay. But promise to scram out
after you've eaten.

458
00:32:35,827 --> 00:32:37,567
- All right.
- I'll get the steward.

459
00:32:37,659 --> 00:32:39,944
You fellows be quiet.
Remember, you're stowaways.

460
00:32:40,032 --> 00:32:41,358
- We no say nothing.
- All right.

461
00:32:41,448 --> 00:32:44,976
Now, just put that bag of Jell-O over here.

462
00:32:46,985 --> 00:32:49,140
Wouldn't it be simpler
if you had him stuffed?

463
00:32:49,234 --> 00:32:52,230
- He's no olive.
- I'll go and get the steward.

464
00:32:53,356 --> 00:32:55,724
Is it the door of the room,
or am I in the trunk?

465
00:32:55,812 --> 00:32:57,139
Over here.

466
00:32:58,352 --> 00:33:01,135
Be quiet, now. Don't make any noise.

467
00:33:01,225 --> 00:33:03,972
- We no say nothing.
- I'll get the steward.

468
00:33:06,263 --> 00:33:07,920
Steward!

469
00:33:08,637 --> 00:33:10,045
- Stew!
- Yes, sir.

470
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:11,462
- I say, stew...
- Yes, sir.

471
00:33:11,551 --> 00:33:13,375
- What's for dinner?
- Anything you like.

472
00:33:13,466 --> 00:33:16,912
Tomatojuice, orange juice,
grape juice, pineapple juice...

473
00:33:17,006 --> 00:33:19,539
Turn off the juice before I get electrocuted.

474
00:33:19,629 --> 00:33:22,032
All right, let me have one of each.

475
00:33:22,876 --> 00:33:25,363
And two fried eggs, two poached eggs...

476
00:33:25,458 --> 00:33:27,660
two scrambled eggs,
and two medium-boiled eggs.

477
00:33:27,748 --> 00:33:29,618
And two hard-boiled eggs.

478
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:31,576
And two hard-boiled eggs.

479
00:33:33,119 --> 00:33:35,522
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.

480
00:33:36,367 --> 00:33:39,943
And some roast beef:
Rare, medium, well-done, and overdone.

481
00:33:40,114 --> 00:33:41,984
And two hard-boiled eggs.

482
00:33:45,360 --> 00:33:47,764
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.

483
00:33:48,566 --> 00:33:50,686
And eight pieces of French pastry.

484
00:33:51,023 --> 00:33:54,102
- With two hard-boiled eggs.
- And two hard-boiled eggs.

485
00:33:55,978 --> 00:33:58,381
Make that three hard-boiled eggs.

486
00:33:59,891 --> 00:34:01,513
And one duck egg.

487
00:34:03,056 --> 00:34:05,341
- Have you got any stewed prunes?
- Yes, sir.

488
00:34:05,429 --> 00:34:07,880
Give them some black coffee.
That'll sober them up.

489
00:34:07,969 --> 00:34:09,674
And two hard-boiled eggs.

490
00:34:18,128 --> 00:34:21,492
It's either foggy out,
or make that 12 more hard-boiled eggs.

491
00:34:23,083 --> 00:34:26,908
Rush that along. The faster it comes,
the faster this convention will be over.

492
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:28,026
Yes, sir.

493
00:34:28,121 --> 00:34:30,359
- Do they allow tipping on the boat?
- Yes, sir!

494
00:34:30,453 --> 00:34:32,489
- Have you got two fives?
- Yes, sir.

495
00:34:32,576 --> 00:34:35,821
Then you won't need the 10 cents
I was gonna give you.

496
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,692
That's fine. If that steward
is deaf and dumb...

497
00:34:38,780 --> 00:34:41,729
- he'll never know you're in here.
- That's all right.

498
00:34:41,820 --> 00:34:44,058
- Yes?
- We've come to make up your room.

499
00:34:44,151 --> 00:34:47,763
- Are those my hard-boiled eggs?
- I can't tell untiI they get in the room.

500
00:34:47,857 --> 00:34:50,426
Come in, girls. Leave all hope behind.

501
00:34:51,313 --> 00:34:53,882
Work fast because
you gotta get out in 10 minutes.

502
00:34:53,978 --> 00:34:56,547
Tomasso. Wake up.
They're going to fix the bed.

503
00:34:56,642 --> 00:34:59,307
I'd like two pillows on that bed there.

504
00:35:01,056 --> 00:35:02,879
There's a slight misunderstanding here.

505
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:05,375
I said the girls had to work fast,
not your friend.

506
00:35:05,469 --> 00:35:07,009
He's still asleep.

507
00:35:07,093 --> 00:35:09,296
You know, he does better asleep
than I do awake.

508
00:35:09,383 --> 00:35:11,088
Yeah, he always sleeps that way.

509
00:35:11,174 --> 00:35:14,619
- Now he's half-asleep.
- Yes, he's half-asleep in a half Nelson.

510
00:35:15,212 --> 00:35:16,704
- All right, come on.
- Yes?

511
00:35:16,794 --> 00:35:19,411
I'm the engineer.
I'm here to turn off the heat.

512
00:35:19,501 --> 00:35:21,703
You can start right in on him.

513
00:35:21,957 --> 00:35:23,579
Wake up, Tomasso.

514
00:35:24,123 --> 00:35:26,028
Tomasso, we're going to eat soon.

515
00:35:26,121 --> 00:35:29,484
You know, if it wasn't for Gottlieb,
I wouldn't have got this room.

516
00:35:29,577 --> 00:35:31,069
Just hold him there a second.

517
00:35:31,159 --> 00:35:32,900
- Yes?
- Did you want a manicure?

518
00:35:32,991 --> 00:35:34,400
No. Come on in.

519
00:35:35,698 --> 00:35:38,647
I hadn't planned on a manicure,
but on ajourney like this...

520
00:35:38,737 --> 00:35:41,437
you ought to have
every convenience you can get.

521
00:35:43,234 --> 00:35:46,514
Listen, I'm getting the manicure.
Get out of here, will you?

522
00:35:47,189 --> 00:35:49,262
Did you want your nails long or short?

523
00:35:49,354 --> 00:35:53,345
You better make them short.
It's getting kind of crowded in here.

524
00:35:53,851 --> 00:35:57,179
I don't know. This isn't the way
I pictured an ocean voyage.

525
00:35:57,265 --> 00:36:01,505
I always visualized myself in a steamer
chair with a steward bringing me bouillon.

526
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:02,708
Come on, Riccardo.

527
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:06,581
You couldn't get bouillon in unless
they brought it in through a keyhole.

528
00:36:09,340 --> 00:36:10,832
I'm the engineer's assistant.

529
00:36:10,922 --> 00:36:13,539
I had a premonition
you were going to show up.

530
00:36:13,795 --> 00:36:18,449
The engineer's over there in the corner.
You can chop your way right through.

531
00:36:19,125 --> 00:36:21,955
Is it my imagination,
or is it getting crowded in here?

532
00:36:22,039 --> 00:36:23,828
I got plenty of room.

533
00:36:26,078 --> 00:36:28,944
- Yes?
- Is my Aunt Minnie in here?

534
00:36:29,034 --> 00:36:31,319
You can come in and prowl around
if you want to.

535
00:36:31,408 --> 00:36:34,605
If she isn't in here, you can probably
find somebody just as good.

536
00:36:34,697 --> 00:36:36,982
- Could I use your phone?
- Use the phone?

537
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:40,268
- I'll lay you even money you can't get in.
- How do you do?

538
00:36:40,359 --> 00:36:43,604
This boat will be in New York
before you get to that phone.

539
00:36:44,898 --> 00:36:46,176
I came to mop up.

540
00:36:46,272 --> 00:36:48,557
Just the woman I'm looking for.
Come right ahead.

541
00:36:49,145 --> 00:36:52,922
You have to start on the ceiling.
It's the only place that's not occupied.

542
00:36:53,017 --> 00:36:55,799
- You can clean my shoes if you want to.
- Operator.

543
00:36:56,015 --> 00:36:58,927
Tell Aunt Minnie to send up
a bigger room, will you?

544
00:37:01,261 --> 00:37:03,582
- Steward.
- Come right ahead.

545
00:37:03,676 --> 00:37:06,956
- The food!
- We've been waiting all afternoon for you.

546
00:37:07,049 --> 00:37:08,872
I want my Aunt Minnie!

547
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,521
Ladies and gentlemen...

548
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:37,399
it's with great pleasure I welcome you all
on this, the final night of the voyage.

549
00:37:38,276 --> 00:37:40,017
I cannot let the evening pass...

550
00:37:40,108 --> 00:37:44,430
without paying a little tribute
to our distinguished guests of honor:

551
00:37:44,772 --> 00:37:47,602
The three greatest aviators in the world.

552
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:53,091
Three greatest aviators,
but notice they're traveling by boat.

553
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:55,675
We are honored
by your presence, gentlemen.

554
00:37:55,847 --> 00:37:58,132
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Captain.

555
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:05,505
- Do you rumba?
- Why, yes. Of course I do.

556
00:38:05,798 --> 00:38:07,704
Take a rumba from one to ten.

557
00:38:10,128 --> 00:38:13,243
Mr. Claypool went to his reward
three years ago.

558
00:38:13,334 --> 00:38:17,160
- And left you all alone.
- All alone.

559
00:38:17,331 --> 00:38:19,486
With $8 million.

560
00:38:19,955 --> 00:38:21,576
$8 million.

561
00:38:21,662 --> 00:38:23,651
Gottlieb, you're just wasting your time.

562
00:38:23,744 --> 00:38:26,858
If Mrs. Claypool wants to marry
a fortune hunter, she's got me.

563
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:28,146
Fortune hunter?

564
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:30,692
In fact, you can't call me a fortune hunter.

565
00:38:30,780 --> 00:38:33,978
Because when I proposed to her,
I thought she only had $7 million.

566
00:38:34,069 --> 00:38:37,149
But the extra million never interfered
with my feelings for her.

567
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:38,891
If you had any real feeling for me...

568
00:38:38,983 --> 00:38:41,848
you'd stop associating
with the riffraff I've seen you with.

569
00:38:41,939 --> 00:38:43,052
You mean Gottlieb?

570
00:38:43,146 --> 00:38:46,675
I mean those two uncouth men
I saw you around the opera house with.

571
00:38:46,769 --> 00:38:49,007
I'm grateful they're not on board the boat.

572
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:51,717
- Why, have they slipped off?
- Sit down.

573
00:38:59,884 --> 00:39:01,673
Come on, we find something to eat.

574
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:04,458
You think it's safe?
If they catch us, they'll deport us.

575
00:39:04,548 --> 00:39:07,117
What will we lose?
If we're deported, they'll feed us.

576
00:39:07,212 --> 00:39:09,083
Come on, we'll take a chance.

577
00:39:10,127 --> 00:39:13,325
Does it mean nothing to you
that I'm the world's greatest singer?

578
00:39:13,416 --> 00:39:16,447
- But I love to hear you sing, Rodolfo.
- No.

579
00:39:17,871 --> 00:39:19,944
Let me put it this way. I love you.

580
00:39:20,036 --> 00:39:22,109
I adore you. I would die for you.

581
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:25,987
- Now do you understand?
- I'm afraid I don't.

582
00:39:26,365 --> 00:39:27,940
The whole thing is very simple.

583
00:39:28,031 --> 00:39:30,943
When he says he's the greatest singer,
it means he loves you.

584
00:39:31,029 --> 00:39:33,811
Personally, I don't believe
either statement.

585
00:39:34,026 --> 00:39:36,691
There may be something in what you say.

586
00:39:36,774 --> 00:39:38,847
I'll tell you something confidentially.

587
00:39:38,940 --> 00:39:42,101
The only tenor I could ever stand
was a fellow by the name...

588
00:39:42,187 --> 00:39:43,844
of Riccardo Baroni.

589
00:39:43,936 --> 00:39:46,848
- Ever hear of him?
- Riccardo.

590
00:39:47,350 --> 00:39:49,671
I wonder where he is right now.

591
00:39:49,765 --> 00:39:52,844
Probably roaming
over the countryside someplace.

592
00:39:53,013 --> 00:39:57,548
Riccardo always loved the open.
He never could stand being cooped up.

593
00:39:57,801 --> 00:39:59,790
He still doesn't like it.

594
00:41:05,128 --> 00:41:08,988
Tomasso, you feel better now?
And, you, Riccardo, how do you feel?

595
00:41:09,083 --> 00:41:12,032
After a meal like that? Great.
I could sing my head off.

596
00:41:12,123 --> 00:41:13,496
That's the spirit.

597
00:41:25,446 --> 00:41:27,731
Stop that! Get away
from those instruments!

598
00:41:27,820 --> 00:41:30,022
- What are you doing here?
- Please let him play.

599
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:32,312
Let him play.

600
00:41:34,648 --> 00:41:37,265
It's all right with me. Let him play.

601
00:50:57,827 --> 00:50:59,946
Those men can't be passengers
on this boat.

602
00:51:00,034 --> 00:51:03,977
- They must be stowaways.
- Stowaways? We'll soon find out.

603
00:52:00,657 --> 00:52:02,942
What are you... Are you crazy?

604
00:52:26,472 --> 00:52:30,214
You got it. Fine.
Now you go first and see if it's safe.

605
00:52:30,302 --> 00:52:33,417
Come on. Hold on. Out you go.

606
00:52:56,117 --> 00:52:58,947
You're all right,
but the boat's too far away.

607
00:53:15,103 --> 00:53:16,725
What's he doing now?

608
00:53:17,102 --> 00:53:18,724
I think he's hanging himself.

609
00:54:28,217 --> 00:54:31,130
- Gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to...
- Quiet.

610
00:54:31,215 --> 00:54:34,874
Our guests have asked me to represent
them and to act as their interpreter.

611
00:54:34,963 --> 00:54:37,247
If you'll follow me,
I'll take you to their cabin.

612
00:54:37,336 --> 00:54:40,699
If they're still in it,
very few of us will come out alive.

613
00:54:49,994 --> 00:54:52,563
Pardon me. Our guests
are having their shredded wheat.

614
00:54:52,658 --> 00:54:54,067
They'll be right out.

615
00:54:58,612 --> 00:54:59,938
Gentlemen.

616
00:55:02,734 --> 00:55:05,351
- "Kind friends..."
- Give me that. Let's cut this short.

617
00:55:05,441 --> 00:55:08,223
The whole thing is very simple.
You're going to City Hall.

618
00:55:08,314 --> 00:55:09,971
The Mayor's gonna make another speech.

619
00:55:10,062 --> 00:55:12,549
We can tear up the Mayor's speech
when we get there.

620
00:55:15,309 --> 00:55:18,174
So, my friends,
as mayor of this great city...

621
00:55:18,307 --> 00:55:21,302
I take pleasure in inviting
our distinguished visitors...

622
00:55:21,388 --> 00:55:23,672
to tell us something
about their achievement.

623
00:55:29,757 --> 00:55:30,999
What'll I say?

624
00:55:31,089 --> 00:55:33,919
- Tell them you're not here.
- Suppose they don't believe me?

625
00:55:34,004 --> 00:55:36,158
They'll believe you when you start talking.

626
00:55:39,999 --> 00:55:41,077
Friends...

627
00:55:41,165 --> 00:55:43,699
Talk fast.
I see a man in the crowd with a rope.

628
00:55:44,371 --> 00:55:48,279
How we happen to come to America
is a great story, but I no tell that.

629
00:55:48,410 --> 00:55:49,783
When we first started out...

630
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:53,112
we got no idea
you give us this grand reception.

631
00:55:53,448 --> 00:55:55,236
We don't deserve it.

632
00:55:55,322 --> 00:55:57,145
When I say we don't deserve it...

633
00:55:57,237 --> 00:55:59,273
believe me, I know what I'm talking about.

634
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,101
That's a novelty.

635
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,604
Now I tell you how we fly to America.

636
00:56:03,857 --> 00:56:07,102
The first time, we get halfway across
when we run out of gasoline.

637
00:56:07,188 --> 00:56:08,561
We got to go back.

638
00:56:08,645 --> 00:56:10,718
Then I take twice as much gasoline.

639
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,511
This time, we were just about to land,
maybe 3 feet...

640
00:56:13,600 --> 00:56:16,169
when, what do you think,
we run out of gasoline again.

641
00:56:16,265 --> 00:56:18,420
Back we go and get more gas.

642
00:56:18,513 --> 00:56:21,047
This time, I take plenty gas.

643
00:56:22,261 --> 00:56:25,256
We get halfway over,
when what do you think happened?

644
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:26,963
We forgot the airplane.

645
00:56:27,049 --> 00:56:29,417
So we sit down and talk it over.

646
00:56:29,505 --> 00:56:31,329
Then I get the great idea...

647
00:56:31,421 --> 00:56:34,784
we no take gasoline.
We no take the airplane.

648
00:56:35,376 --> 00:56:37,117
We take steamship.

649
00:56:37,208 --> 00:56:40,488
And that, friends,
is how we fly across the ocean.

650
00:56:43,204 --> 00:56:45,110
I'm going out to arrange your baiI.

651
00:56:46,035 --> 00:56:47,776
This is the mayor again.

652
00:56:47,867 --> 00:56:52,071
And now I take great pleasure
in introducing another of our heroes...

653
00:56:52,197 --> 00:56:55,063
who will tell you something
of his exploits.

654
00:56:56,777 --> 00:56:57,890
Of course.

655
00:56:57,985 --> 00:57:00,388
From now on, it's every man for himself.

656
00:57:00,483 --> 00:57:04,687
I would suggest you make your speech
a little more direct than your brother's.

657
00:57:08,228 --> 00:57:10,975
What will you give me
to set fire to your beard?

658
00:57:39,747 --> 00:57:43,323
We're all right
as long as the water supply holds out.

659
00:57:48,199 --> 00:57:50,484
Please, the radio. Your speech.

660
00:57:56,776 --> 00:57:59,689
They may have to build
a dam in the back of him.

661
00:58:14,180 --> 00:58:16,501
I think these fellas are phonies.

662
00:58:16,595 --> 00:58:18,466
- What's that you say?
- You heard me.

663
00:58:24,798 --> 00:58:25,910
You hear what they say?

664
00:58:26,005 --> 00:58:28,918
They've never been so insulted,
and they refuse to stay.

665
00:58:29,003 --> 00:58:32,496
No, please. Tell them he didn't mean it.

666
00:58:39,870 --> 00:58:42,108
Of course, you know this means war.

667
00:58:43,701 --> 00:58:45,157
Now see what you've done.

668
00:58:45,241 --> 00:58:47,609
I'm sorry. I'm awful sorry.

669
00:58:49,696 --> 00:58:52,645
I apologize,
and I hope you're not offended.

670
00:58:58,732 --> 00:59:00,934
Go on! After him!

671
00:59:01,022 --> 00:59:02,810
Come on, get him.

672
00:59:11,597 --> 00:59:14,214
What are you singing about? Read this.

673
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:18,633
What will you do?

674
00:59:18,717 --> 00:59:22,874
First, I'll throw those two gorillas out.
That goes for you, too.

675
00:59:23,047 --> 00:59:25,794
Thought I got rid of those mugs
when I sold my trunk.

676
00:59:30,292 --> 00:59:33,371
Kiddies, come on, everything is piping hot.

677
00:59:33,623 --> 00:59:34,996
Breakfast.

678
00:59:36,038 --> 00:59:39,034
- Good morning.
- Oh, boy, I'm hungry.

679
00:59:39,411 --> 00:59:41,732
Read that.
That will take away your appetite.

680
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:44,646
No. That only makes me hungrier.

681
00:59:44,740 --> 00:59:47,570
Come on. You're going to be late forjaiI.

682
00:59:49,778 --> 00:59:51,933
Those certainly went like hot cakes.

683
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:56,932
You know, this isn't the way
I anticipated my breakfast.

684
00:59:57,981 --> 01:00:00,219
I'm certainly getting enough of you fellas.

685
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:03,222
- I no like cupcakes.
- No.

686
01:00:03,935 --> 01:00:05,391
I know when I've had enough...

687
01:00:05,475 --> 01:00:08,720
Say, wait a minute.
That was a two-bit cigar.

688
01:00:10,472 --> 01:00:13,586
Bad enough I have to smoke those things
without eating them.

689
01:00:16,051 --> 01:00:17,247
Get out.

690
01:00:18,716 --> 01:00:20,456
Glad I didn't bring my vest.

691
01:00:20,548 --> 01:00:23,662
I forgot to tell you.
He ate your vest last night for dessert.

692
01:00:23,754 --> 01:00:24,783
He's half goat.

693
01:00:24,878 --> 01:00:27,708
Yes, and that's giving him
all the best of it.

694
01:00:32,622 --> 01:00:34,695
Thought I had another cigar on me.

695
01:00:39,992 --> 01:00:43,770
He's going to smell like a vegetable salad
when he gets through with that.

696
01:00:44,364 --> 01:00:48,106
I've been looking forward to this breakfast.
I've been waiting all morning.

697
01:00:48,195 --> 01:00:50,148
This is how it wound up.

698
01:00:59,520 --> 01:01:02,350
- I'll take a quart.
- A little of that, anyway.

699
01:01:07,056 --> 01:01:10,585
Why don't you fellows be nice?
Get out of here before I get arrested.

700
01:01:10,678 --> 01:01:12,963
I'd like to stay and see that.

701
01:01:14,176 --> 01:01:15,549
What's that?

702
01:01:17,007 --> 01:01:19,043
If it's a policeman, knock once more.

703
01:01:19,714 --> 01:01:22,330
- That's good enough for me.
- Scram, get out.

704
01:01:25,126 --> 01:01:26,369
Come in.

705
01:01:39,075 --> 01:01:41,229
- Yes?
- You remember me.

706
01:01:41,323 --> 01:01:43,526
I'm Henderson, plainclothesman.

707
01:01:43,696 --> 01:01:45,981
You look more like
an old clothes man to me.

708
01:01:47,902 --> 01:01:50,435
- Nice place.
- It's comfortable.

709
01:01:51,524 --> 01:01:53,348
You live here all alone?

710
01:01:53,606 --> 01:01:55,476
Yes. Just me and my memories.

711
01:01:55,563 --> 01:01:58,926
- I'm practically a hermit.
- A hermit.

712
01:01:59,643 --> 01:02:01,763
I notice the table is set for four.

713
01:02:01,850 --> 01:02:04,053
That's nothing.
My alarm clock is set for 8:00.

714
01:02:04,140 --> 01:02:05,928
That doesn't prove a thing.

715
01:02:06,014 --> 01:02:07,340
A wise guy.

716
01:02:08,470 --> 01:02:10,792
I'll take a little look around.

717
01:02:16,589 --> 01:02:18,211
- Hey, you.
- Coming.

718
01:02:19,629 --> 01:02:22,625
What's a hermit doing with four beds?

719
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:24,824
- You see those first three beds?
- Yes.

720
01:02:24,917 --> 01:02:27,486
Last night, I counted 5,000 sheep
on those beds.

721
01:02:27,582 --> 01:02:28,990
So I had to have another bed.

722
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,745
You wouldn't want me
to sleep with the sheep, would you?

723
01:02:40,447 --> 01:02:42,815
- Who are you talking to?
- I was talking to myself.

724
01:02:42,904 --> 01:02:44,479
There's nothing you can do about it.

725
01:02:44,569 --> 01:02:48,015
- I've had three of the best doctors.
- I certainly heard somebody talk.

726
01:02:48,108 --> 01:02:50,098
- Sheer folly on your part.
- What's this?

727
01:02:50,190 --> 01:02:51,895
That's a fire escape.

728
01:02:51,981 --> 01:02:54,017
That's a table. This is a room.

729
01:02:54,104 --> 01:02:56,638
There's the door leading out.
I wish you would use it.

730
01:02:56,727 --> 01:03:00,173
- I want to be alone.
- You'll be alone when I throw you in jaiI.

731
01:03:00,266 --> 01:03:02,883
Isn't there a song like that, Henderson?

732
01:03:04,097 --> 01:03:06,086
Look out.
He's coming around the other way.

733
01:03:06,179 --> 01:03:07,587
Get inside, quick.

734
01:03:08,469 --> 01:03:11,418
It means a stretch at the big house
if he catches you.

735
01:03:11,508 --> 01:03:12,751
Don't let him catch you.

736
01:03:12,841 --> 01:03:14,167
- Hey, you!
- Coming.

737
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:16,544
What became of that fourth bed?

738
01:03:16,630 --> 01:03:18,205
What are you referring to, Colonel?

739
01:03:18,295 --> 01:03:21,244
Last time I was in this room,
there were four beds here.

740
01:03:21,335 --> 01:03:24,745
Please. I'm not interested
in your private life, Henderson.

741
01:03:29,287 --> 01:03:31,111
Say, what's that bed doing here?

742
01:03:31,202 --> 01:03:32,777
I don't see it doing anything.

743
01:03:32,868 --> 01:03:36,610
There's something funny going on here.
But I'll get to the bottom of it.

744
01:03:36,699 --> 01:03:38,072
Stairs right there.

745
01:03:38,156 --> 01:03:39,233
Look out!

746
01:03:41,737 --> 01:03:43,975
- Be on your guard.
- Hey, you!

747
01:03:44,068 --> 01:03:45,098
Coming.

748
01:03:45,192 --> 01:03:48,472
Am I crazy,
or are there only two beds here?

749
01:03:48,773 --> 01:03:51,390
Which question
do you want me to answer first?

750
01:03:57,059 --> 01:03:59,131
How did those two beds get together?

751
01:03:59,224 --> 01:04:02,006
You know how those things are.
They breed like rabbits.

752
01:04:02,097 --> 01:04:03,636
Let me tell you something.

753
01:04:03,721 --> 01:04:06,338
I'll solve this
if I have to stay here all night.

754
01:04:06,427 --> 01:04:09,707
- Lf you stay, you'll have to bring a bed.
- One bed!

755
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,287
One bed? What are you talking about?

756
01:04:19,043 --> 01:04:22,536
Now they're all gone. I know I am crazy.

757
01:04:42,235 --> 01:04:44,900
I beg your pardon,
I must be in the wrong room.

758
01:05:04,052 --> 01:05:06,504
You thought you could come to America
without me?

759
01:05:06,592 --> 01:05:09,623
You fool. You dear fool.

760
01:05:09,715 --> 01:05:13,409
Because I love you, you call me a fool.
There may be something in that.

761
01:05:13,504 --> 01:05:16,073
- What are you doing here?
- Easiest thing in the world.

762
01:05:16,169 --> 01:05:18,158
An open window,
a detective, and here I am.

763
01:05:18,251 --> 01:05:20,157
Riccardo, you shouldn't have.

764
01:05:20,790 --> 01:05:22,863
They'll only send you back again.

765
01:05:22,956 --> 01:05:26,401
- Perhaps even put you in jaiI.
- I don't care, darling. It's worth it.

766
01:05:26,495 --> 01:05:29,692
Suppose I go to Mr. Gottlieb.
Maybe he'd intercede for you.

767
01:05:29,784 --> 01:05:33,194
Gottlieb couldn't do anything.
Besides, Lassparri's got to him first.

768
01:05:33,281 --> 01:05:35,105
But there must be something we can do.

769
01:05:36,904 --> 01:05:39,686
- Who is it?
- It is I. Rodolfo.

770
01:05:48,187 --> 01:05:49,430
Come in.

771
01:05:52,185 --> 01:05:53,463
Do you mind my dropping down?

772
01:05:53,559 --> 01:05:58,177
No, of course not.
Only, I was just going to take a nap.

773
01:05:58,888 --> 01:06:01,635
- Rosa, why do you do this to me?
- Do what, Rodolfo?

774
01:06:01,719 --> 01:06:04,004
Whenever I want to see you,
you make some excuse.

775
01:06:04,093 --> 01:06:07,456
You will not dine with me, ride with me,
or even take a walk with me.

776
01:06:07,549 --> 01:06:10,628
But, Rodolfo, you know how busy I am.

777
01:06:10,713 --> 01:06:12,453
My debut in America.

778
01:06:12,795 --> 01:06:14,949
Have you forgotten that it was I...

779
01:06:15,043 --> 01:06:17,956
who brought about your debut in America?

780
01:06:18,041 --> 01:06:20,444
No, I haven't forgotten.

781
01:06:21,289 --> 01:06:23,573
Then why do you treat me this way?

782
01:06:23,662 --> 01:06:26,444
Rodolfo, I must ask you to leave.

783
01:06:26,577 --> 01:06:29,146
Come now, my dear. Be sensible.

784
01:06:29,241 --> 01:06:32,107
If you ask me,
I think she's being very sensible.

785
01:06:32,822 --> 01:06:34,018
Baroni.

786
01:06:36,444 --> 01:06:37,984
Now I understand.

787
01:06:38,610 --> 01:06:41,522
You did not tell me
you had a previous engagement.

788
01:06:41,607 --> 01:06:42,803
Now you know it.

789
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:44,271
And I apologize.

790
01:06:44,355 --> 01:06:46,558
Now, permit me to withdraw.

791
01:06:46,854 --> 01:06:49,849
In a boudoir, two are company,
three a crowd.

792
01:06:50,018 --> 01:06:52,386
- Just what do you mean by that?
- Please, Riccardo.

793
01:06:52,475 --> 01:06:54,547
Surely I have made my meaning clear.

794
01:06:54,640 --> 01:06:56,131
Riccardo!

795
01:06:57,929 --> 01:06:59,586
You have not heard the end of this.

796
01:06:59,678 --> 01:07:02,425
- I'm sure I haven't.
- You may be very sure.

797
01:07:07,089 --> 01:07:09,706
- Good afternoon, Mr. Driftwood.
- Good afternoon.

798
01:07:09,795 --> 01:07:11,915
- Ready for the opening tonight?
- Am I?

799
01:07:17,748 --> 01:07:20,152
That's all right, boys.
I was young myself once.

800
01:07:20,246 --> 01:07:21,407
Thank you.

801
01:07:23,411 --> 01:07:24,986
Good morning, Mr. Driftwood.

802
01:07:25,076 --> 01:07:28,155
- How are all my songbirds?
- Fine.

803
01:07:28,241 --> 01:07:30,313
Splendid. Sing well tonight, now.

804
01:07:33,903 --> 01:07:36,141
Waiting for you, Mr. Driftwood.
Step right in.

805
01:07:36,235 --> 01:07:37,431
Thank you, Otto.

806
01:07:37,526 --> 01:07:40,308
- Nice day, isn't it?
- It has its points.

807
01:07:42,231 --> 01:07:43,343
Here you are, sir.

808
01:07:43,438 --> 01:07:46,350
- Thank you, Otto.
- That's all right, Mr. Driftwood.

809
01:07:47,227 --> 01:07:49,761
What's all this? What's going on here?

810
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:51,804
You mean, what's coming off here?

811
01:07:51,890 --> 01:07:54,377
- You can't do that.
- Wanna bet?

812
01:07:55,096 --> 01:07:56,671
But that's my office.

813
01:07:56,762 --> 01:07:59,544
I'm taking orders from Mr. Gottlieb.
Go see him about it.

814
01:07:59,635 --> 01:08:02,915
I'll see Mr. Gottlieb,
and I'll break you, my fine fellow.

815
01:08:03,007 --> 01:08:04,831
Go see Mr. Gottlieb.

816
01:08:06,255 --> 01:08:09,867
What's the meaning of this?
If you think that I'm going to...

817
01:08:10,460 --> 01:08:13,029
If you're busy, I'll return later.

818
01:08:13,125 --> 01:08:16,239
Just a minute, Mr. Driftwood.
We have some news for you.

819
01:08:16,331 --> 01:08:17,609
News? For me?

820
01:08:17,705 --> 01:08:21,909
Mrs. Claypool has decided to dispense
with your services immediately.

821
01:08:21,994 --> 01:08:24,527
Dispense with my services?
She hasn't even had them.

822
01:08:24,617 --> 01:08:27,814
I warned you, if you continued to associate
with those men...

823
01:08:27,906 --> 01:08:29,895
everything would be over between us.

824
01:08:29,988 --> 01:08:31,894
And you've been associating with them.

825
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:33,940
How do you know? You couldn't find them.

826
01:08:34,693 --> 01:08:37,226
You've disgraced me,
and the entire Opera Company.

827
01:08:37,316 --> 01:08:40,063
As Mrs. Claypool's
new business manager...

828
01:08:40,147 --> 01:08:42,220
I must request you to get out and stay out.

829
01:08:42,312 --> 01:08:45,261
Just a minute. You can't fire me
without two weeks' salary.

830
01:08:45,352 --> 01:08:47,092
That's in section 10-A of my contract.

831
01:08:47,184 --> 01:08:51,424
I find that you have overdrawn your salary
for the next six months.

832
01:08:51,514 --> 01:08:55,505
- In that case, I'll take one week's salary.
- You'll take nothing. Get out.

833
01:08:55,719 --> 01:08:59,378
If that's your best offer, I'll get out,
but I'm not making a nickel on it.

834
01:08:59,467 --> 01:09:02,711
As for you, Mrs. Claypool,
I withdraw my offer of marriage.

835
01:09:04,588 --> 01:09:06,661
And that goes for you, too.

836
01:09:08,835 --> 01:09:11,369
The thanks I get
for working my fingers to the bone.

837
01:09:11,458 --> 01:09:13,826
- All right, Otto.
- Just a minute.

838
01:09:14,789 --> 01:09:17,619
This car is for officials. Take the stairs.

839
01:09:18,287 --> 01:09:19,861
- The stairs?
- Yeah.

840
01:09:21,118 --> 01:09:24,279
Why, that's four flights.
I can't walk all that distance.

841
01:09:24,366 --> 01:09:26,438
All right. I'll help you.

842
01:09:51,346 --> 01:09:54,176
- Now there's room.
- That's all I needed.

843
01:09:54,760 --> 01:09:56,714
I'm certainly glad I met you boys.

844
01:09:56,801 --> 01:10:00,045
First you get me fired,
then you get me thrown out of my hotel...

845
01:10:00,131 --> 01:10:02,251
and finally you push me off a park bench.

846
01:10:02,338 --> 01:10:05,867
There's one consolation.
Nothing more can happen to me.

847
01:10:06,918 --> 01:10:08,707
Get off of the grass.

848
01:10:10,499 --> 01:10:11,907
I was wrong.

849
01:10:16,203 --> 01:10:18,607
People drink too much water, anyhow.

850
01:10:18,785 --> 01:10:20,655
I'm certainly glad you came along.

851
01:10:21,075 --> 01:10:25,314
When I met you boys, I had a good job
and was about to marry a rich widow.

852
01:10:25,405 --> 01:10:27,276
Now I can't even sit on the grass.

853
01:10:27,362 --> 01:10:29,647
I'd give you my seat, but I'm sitting here.

854
01:10:29,735 --> 01:10:33,098
That's an offer.
I'd like to think it over for a couple of days.

855
01:10:33,358 --> 01:10:34,684
Where can I find you?

856
01:10:34,773 --> 01:10:37,260
Don't worry.
Wherever you are, you'll find us.

857
01:10:37,355 --> 01:10:40,304
I'm sick of that.
Let's meet somewhere else.

858
01:10:42,226 --> 01:10:43,552
It's Rosa.

859
01:10:46,390 --> 01:10:48,758
At least I can get my bench back.

860
01:10:49,263 --> 01:10:51,418
Don't feel so badly, Riccardo.

861
01:10:52,427 --> 01:10:55,210
I can't feel cheerful
about being such a hoodoo to you.

862
01:10:55,300 --> 01:10:57,336
We all make things bad for you.

863
01:11:03,877 --> 01:11:05,038
What's the matter?

864
01:11:05,126 --> 01:11:08,288
What do you think?
Lassparri. He's get Rosa fired.

865
01:11:08,499 --> 01:11:10,654
- Lassparri?
- He won't let her sing tonight.

866
01:11:10,747 --> 01:11:12,571
What do you know about that?

867
01:11:12,663 --> 01:11:15,280
We've got all day to think of some plan.

868
01:11:15,369 --> 01:11:17,986
And believe me,
the way I think, it'll take all day.

869
01:11:27,902 --> 01:11:29,524
- Good evening, Tim.
- Good evening.

870
01:11:29,609 --> 01:11:30,887
Plenty for you tonight.

871
01:11:30,983 --> 01:11:33,138
- Thank you.
- You're welcome, sir.

872
01:11:50,386 --> 01:11:52,209
What does this mean?

873
01:11:52,634 --> 01:11:54,256
Just the man I want to see.

874
01:11:54,341 --> 01:11:57,621
Gottlieb, these are the worst cigars
I ever smoked.

875
01:11:57,714 --> 01:12:00,165
Yes, and your ice isn't cold enough, either.

876
01:12:00,254 --> 01:12:03,747
Get out of here, all of you.
I shall send for the police.

877
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:06,747
Just a minute.
I'll tell you what we came here for.

878
01:12:07,373 --> 01:12:09,031
We make you a proposition.

879
01:12:09,122 --> 01:12:11,656
So you're willing to give yourselves up?

880
01:12:11,870 --> 01:12:13,575
Yes, if you let Rosa sing.

881
01:12:13,661 --> 01:12:16,740
I'm managing director,
and Rosa does not sing.

882
01:12:16,825 --> 01:12:18,731
But the rest of your proposition...

883
01:12:18,824 --> 01:12:22,684
giving yourselves up,
that rather appeals to me.

884
01:12:24,694 --> 01:12:28,223
Give me police headquarters.
Sergeant Henderson, please.

885
01:12:55,630 --> 01:12:57,003
Hello, toots.

886
01:12:57,671 --> 01:13:00,122
What are you doing here?
This is Mr. Gottlieb's box.

887
01:13:00,210 --> 01:13:02,164
He couldn't come,
so he gave me his ticket.

888
01:13:02,251 --> 01:13:05,246
And he couldn't get dressed,
so he gave me his clothes.

889
01:13:07,122 --> 01:13:09,609
Shorty, will you toss up that kelly?

890
01:13:12,743 --> 01:13:14,531
Attaboy. Here.

891
01:13:15,741 --> 01:13:17,565
Get yourself a stogy.

892
01:13:20,196 --> 01:13:21,439
Who's ahead?

893
01:13:22,070 --> 01:13:23,526
Open the door.

894
01:13:31,355 --> 01:13:33,261
Get me police headquarters.

895
01:13:34,852 --> 01:13:37,469
Mrs. Claypool,
have you seen Mr. Gottlieb?

896
01:13:37,559 --> 01:13:38,932
No. Isn't he backstage?

897
01:13:39,016 --> 01:13:41,088
He's disappeared.
We can't find him anywhere.

898
01:13:41,181 --> 01:13:42,803
You didn't look in the right place.

899
01:13:42,888 --> 01:13:45,422
He was to make a speech
before the curtain went up.

900
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:49,914
That's the cue.
You'd better say something.

901
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:51,748
But I never made a speech in my life.

902
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,409
- All right, I'll take care of it.
- You?

903
01:13:55,338 --> 01:13:57,208
Ladies and gentlemen...

904
01:13:57,336 --> 01:13:59,242
I guess that takes in most of you.

905
01:13:59,335 --> 01:14:01,489
This is the opening of a new opera season.

906
01:14:01,583 --> 01:14:05,361
A season made possible
by the generous checks of Mrs. Claypool.

907
01:14:11,701 --> 01:14:15,608
I'm sure the familiar strains of Verdi's
music will come back to you tonight...

908
01:14:15,698 --> 01:14:18,942
and Mrs. Claypool's checks
will probably come back in the morning.

909
01:14:21,111 --> 01:14:24,556
Tonight marks the American debut
of Rodolfo Lassparri.

910
01:14:27,190 --> 01:14:29,972
Slgnor Lassparri comes
from a very famous family.

911
01:14:30,063 --> 01:14:32,384
His mother was a well-known bass singer.

912
01:14:32,478 --> 01:14:36,255
His father was the first man to stuff
spaghetti with bicarbonate of soda...

913
01:14:36,350 --> 01:14:39,464
thus causing and curing indigestion
at the same time.

914
01:14:44,511 --> 01:14:47,590
Now, on with the opera.
Let joy be unconfined.

915
01:14:47,675 --> 01:14:49,463
Let there be dancing in the streets...

916
01:14:49,549 --> 01:14:51,952
drinking in the saloons,
and necking in the parlor.

917
01:14:52,047 --> 01:14:53,160
Play, Don.

918
01:15:03,414 --> 01:15:05,154
I'll take this side.

919
01:15:09,493 --> 01:15:11,032
It's none of my business...

920
01:15:11,116 --> 01:15:14,314
but I think there's a brace of woodpeckers
in the orchestra.

921
01:15:32,476 --> 01:15:34,797
Don't give up, boys. The cavalry is coming.

922
01:15:40,512 --> 01:15:42,833
- I'll see you later.
- What are you doing?

923
01:15:42,927 --> 01:15:45,165
It's all right. It's just the Tarzan in me.

924
01:15:49,797 --> 01:15:51,502
That Schwelnehund.

925
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:05,281
Peanuts! Get your fresh
roasted peanuts, folks!

926
01:17:05,951 --> 01:17:09,148
They're nice and hot! Get your peanuts!

927
01:17:09,365 --> 01:17:11,603
Here you are!

928
01:17:22,897 --> 01:17:24,803
There you are, you...

929
01:17:27,185 --> 01:17:28,725
What are you laughing at?

930
01:17:28,809 --> 01:17:31,047
- Those clothes don't fit you.
- Why you...

931
01:17:35,013 --> 01:17:37,843
You're getting to be
a good shot, Tomasso.

932
01:17:38,302 --> 01:17:40,919
The opera starts.
Now we really go to work.

933
01:17:45,297 --> 01:17:46,919
The curtain's up.

934
01:17:51,418 --> 01:17:53,123
- They've started.
- Now, don't worry.

935
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:55,162
Someone open the door here!

936
01:17:56,331 --> 01:17:58,119
Let me out of here!

937
01:17:59,912 --> 01:18:01,155
Herr Gottlieb.

938
01:18:01,369 --> 01:18:03,903
- Where are they? Where did they go?
- What?

939
01:18:03,992 --> 01:18:05,781
"What," he asks me.

940
01:18:09,405 --> 01:18:11,856
- Did a couple of men come up here?
- What?

941
01:18:11,945 --> 01:18:14,432
"What?" All I get is "what."

942
01:18:28,142 --> 01:18:30,344
How would you like to feel
the way she looks?

943
01:18:31,264 --> 01:18:33,337
That is Driftwood's voice.

944
01:18:33,429 --> 01:18:36,425
- I want him put out of the opera house.
- Yes, sir.

945
01:18:53,582 --> 01:18:55,866
That's right. You go talk to him.

946
01:19:02,492 --> 01:19:04,481
We know he's in the audience someplace.

947
01:19:06,864 --> 01:19:09,433
- Where's Mr. Gottlieb?
- The other side of the stage.

948
01:19:09,529 --> 01:19:10,985
Come on, boys.

949
01:19:18,647 --> 01:19:21,429
What was that? High "C" or vitamin "D"?

950
01:19:54,663 --> 01:19:56,403
What's the matter? What happened here?

951
01:19:56,495 --> 01:19:58,650
Mr. Gottlieb! Here, give me a hand.

952
01:20:16,522 --> 01:20:18,973
Where are those men?
Did you catch them?

953
01:20:19,062 --> 01:20:21,300
No, sir. I'm sorry. They're still out there.

954
01:20:21,394 --> 01:20:23,099
Still out there?

955
01:20:25,224 --> 01:20:28,966
I have an idea.
Get me two gypsy costumes at once.

956
01:20:46,292 --> 01:20:48,163
Now we're getting somewhere.

957
01:20:54,412 --> 01:20:56,733
I will not sing unless
they are put off there.

958
01:20:56,826 --> 01:20:57,856
Yes, sir.

959
01:22:35,755 --> 01:22:38,324
A battleship in II Trovatorel

960
01:24:03,109 --> 01:24:05,940
Stop! Don't you do...

961
01:24:09,313 --> 01:24:12,060
Herr Gottlieb! Lassparri, he's disappeared.

962
01:24:12,145 --> 01:24:13,341
What?

963
01:24:20,638 --> 01:24:23,836
- Then we haven't even a tenor.
- Mr. Gottlieb.

964
01:24:25,926 --> 01:24:28,413
- You are Baroni.
- That's who I am.

965
01:24:28,508 --> 01:24:29,999
Get into a costume quickly.

966
01:24:30,090 --> 01:24:32,162
- What?
- I want you to sing.

967
01:24:34,420 --> 01:24:37,250
But I have no reputation, Mr. Gottlieb.

968
01:24:37,335 --> 01:24:40,331
Besides, I couldn't sing
with a strange Leonora.

969
01:24:40,416 --> 01:24:42,903
I've been rehearsing with Miss Castaldi.

970
01:24:43,414 --> 01:24:46,279
- So that's it.
- That's it exactly.

971
01:24:48,119 --> 01:24:51,363
All right.
Get them two costumes at once. Quick.

972
01:24:52,033 --> 01:24:56,023
Please, after the opera.
Go ahead. Get ready.

973
01:25:42,954 --> 01:25:45,523
You hear that? That's real singing.

974
01:27:18,844 --> 01:27:20,501
- What?
- Get off!

975
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:29,243
Is this the opera house?

976
01:27:29,753 --> 01:27:32,369
Arrest those men, and this one, too.

977
01:27:32,584 --> 01:27:35,745
- It's about time.
- Lassparri, where have you been?

978
01:27:35,832 --> 01:27:38,116
Been? Do you know what they did to me?

979
01:27:40,786 --> 01:27:44,031
I'll sing them an encore
that they'll never forget.

980
01:27:52,778 --> 01:27:55,727
Never in my life
have I received such treatment.

981
01:27:55,817 --> 01:27:57,439
They threw an apple at me.

982
01:27:57,524 --> 01:27:59,762
Watermelons are out of season.

983
01:28:04,478 --> 01:28:06,597
Rosa, Baroni, get out there quick.

984
01:28:06,684 --> 01:28:08,922
No. I'm under arrest, Mr. Gottlieb.

985
01:28:09,016 --> 01:28:12,095
- What's that?
- If they're arrested, I ought to be, too.

986
01:28:12,180 --> 01:28:14,051
I can't sing if I'm arrested.

987
01:28:17,635 --> 01:28:18,748
What do we do?

988
01:28:18,842 --> 01:28:21,329
We must have them.
They'll save the entire season.

989
01:28:21,424 --> 01:28:23,543
Well, what is it you want?

990
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:25,252
Just a minute. Let me handle this.

991
01:28:25,338 --> 01:28:29,375
- Quick! What do you want?
- First, call off that police dog.

992
01:28:29,585 --> 01:28:31,373
All right, anything.

993
01:28:31,458 --> 01:28:35,070
These men are in this country
under false pretenses, and I'll do my duty.

994
01:28:35,164 --> 01:28:37,236
I'll be responsible for them.

995
01:28:37,329 --> 01:28:39,898
Besides, they came over here
with Mr. Driftwood.

996
01:28:39,994 --> 01:28:43,274
Mr. Driftwood is an employee
of the Opera Company.

997
01:28:43,366 --> 01:28:45,402
- Since when?
- Since Baroni started singing.

998
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,811
Wait till I get a hold
of that elevator operator.

999
01:28:47,905 --> 01:28:51,233
All right, anything.
Please, go out and sing.

1000
01:28:51,319 --> 01:28:52,562
Wait a minute.

1001
01:28:52,651 --> 01:28:56,097
Before he sings, you gotta sign a contract,
and I get 10%.

1002
01:28:56,191 --> 01:28:58,096
Yes, and I get 10%, too.

1003
01:29:13,053 --> 01:29:14,628
Now, where were we?

1004
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:17,715
- "The party of the 10th part..."
- No.

1005
01:29:17,800 --> 01:29:20,203
- "The party of the 11th part..."
- No.
