1
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,280
Hold it!

2
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,720
Ten. 20.

3
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:54,000
Did you hear about
Mrs Mason's little Willy?

4
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:57,920
Sent him to school and found him
buried ten foot deep in a snowdrift.

5
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,880
- How did they get him out?
- Brought the fire engine round.

6
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,110
Put the hose pipe in, pumped it
backwards and sucked him out.

8
00:02:24,920 --> 00:02:26,440
(piano starts)

9
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:28,270
(laughter)

10
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:40,400
- Perfect bull's-eye.

12
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:07,240
I want a room and a fire.

13
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,640
- Jenny?
- Hello?

14
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,630
There's a gent here
what wants a room and a fire.

15
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,630
What, a room?

16
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:19,070
I said a room.

17
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:23,000
We ain't got none ready,
not at this time of year.

18
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,360
We don't usually have folks stopping,
except in the summer.

19
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,910
You can get one ready.

20
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,150
Certainly, sir. Millie!

21
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,430
Yes?

22
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:37,400
- I want a private sitting room, too.
- Certainly, sir.

23
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,190
Will you come through, sir? This way, sir.

24
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,230
It's the coldest winter
we've had down here for years.

25
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,030
They put all the sheep and the cows in
for a fortnight now.

26
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,560
Poor things. They can't get
a blade of green grass.

27
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,880
You may be near-sighted,
but you can't be deaf-and-dumb as well.

28
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,640
Could I take your coat and hat, sir,
and give 'em a nice dry in the kitchen?

29
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,310
No.

30
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:48,040
- I prefer to keep them on.
- Very good, sir.

31
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:50,240
The room will be warm soon.

32
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,360
I've got some luggage at the station.
How can I have it sent?

33
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:56,240
I'll get it dropped over tomorrow.
Are you staying a bit?

34
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,310
Yes.

35
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,190
- Is there no way of getting it tonight?
- Not tonight, sir.

36
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,190
Very well.

37
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:06,110
Bring me some food.

38
00:05:06,200 --> 00:05:08,110
Right away, sir.

39
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,670
If you ask me,
he's a criminal flying from justice.

40
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:33,360
Go on. He's snow-blind, that's what he is.
Has to wear goggles to save his eyes.

41
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,830
Anyway, you be careful,
and lock your money up.

42
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,480
A bottle of Bass, Herbert.

43
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,310
Here you are, dear.

44
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:51,400
I hope he'll be a bit more
communicative this time.

46
00:06:01,760 --> 00:06:03,670
Your supper's there.

47
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,400
Is there a key to that door?

48
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:11,630
A key, sir? Ooh, I haven't ever seen one.

49
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:14,710
I don't think there was one
when we came here.

50
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,790
I want to be left alone, and undisturbed.

51
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:20,480
I'll see that no one disturbs you, sir.

52
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,560
The mustard, ma'am.

53
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,790
You'll be the death of me
with your slowness.

54
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,920
You let me take his supper in
and forget the mustard.

55
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,910
And him wanting to be left alone!

57
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,990
There she goes again.

58
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,880
I told you not to disturb me.

59
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:59,350
It's only the mustard, sir. I forgot it.

60
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,670
- I'm sorry.
- Thank you.

61
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:08,070
Have you been motoring
on them slippery roads, sir?

62
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,760
You can take my overcoat and dry it.

63
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,750
Very good, sir.

64
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,480
- Leave the hat.
- Yes, sir.

65
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:31,960
Bandages, right up to the top of his head.
All round his ears.

66
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:35,080
- Any blood?
- No. No blood.

67
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,440
Looks like some kind of 'orrible accident.

68
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,400
Bumped his head
on the prison wall gettin' over.

69
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,950
Father.

70
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,480
I wish you'd leave me alone,
Flora, when I'm working.

71
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,680
I can't bear it. We've got to do something.

72
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:18,640
- Do something? What about?
- About Jack.

73
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,680
He'll come back. Don't you worry.

74
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,720
Father, please put
that horrid thing down and listen.

75
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,270
It's nearly a month now, without a word.

76
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:30,560
But the note he left was quite clear.
He said we might not hear for a while.

77
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,920
It's good to go away when
you're finishing a difficult experiment.

78
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:37,760
- What kind of experiment is it, Father?
- Something of his own.

79
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:42,440
I had a terrible feeling last night.
I felt he was in desperate trouble.

80
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:46,960
Hello, Kemp. Flora's worried about Griffin.

81
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,390
I don't wonder. I should have thought
at least he could drop a line.

82
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:52,800
It's a queer thing.

83
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:55,480
It certainly is,
considering he was in your employ.

84
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:59,270
He had my permission to carry out
his own experiments in his spare time.

85
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,560
And to clear off when he liked?

86
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:04,550
What does it matter, if he's in trouble?

88
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,830
I've got the car outside.
It'll give you a rest to come for a run.

89
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,120
Do you think there are
any papers in his room?

90
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:34,640
Surely he must have arranged where
he was going. There may be letters.

91
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,600
He left burnt papers
in his fireplace, that's all.

92
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:42,230
He was so strange those last few days
before he went. So excited and strung up.

93
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,360
Yet he wouldn't say a word to explain.
I've never seen him like it before.

94
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,280
He was always so keen
to tell me about his experiments.

95
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:53,840
He meddled in things
men should leave alone.

96
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:58,200
Your father's a scientist. He's discovered
more about preserving food than anyone.

97
00:09:58,280 --> 00:10:02,040
Jack and I were employed to help him.
That's a plain, straightforward job.

98
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:05,750
It's not romantic, but it saves
hundreds of deaths and stomachaches.

99
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,830
What things should men leave alone?

100
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,960
He worked in secret. He kept a lot of stuff
locked in a big cupboard in his laboratory.

101
00:10:12,040 --> 00:10:15,480
He never opened it until he'd barred
the door and drawn the blinds.

102
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,720
Straightforward scientists have no need
for barred doors and drawn blinds.

103
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,710
He cares nothing for you, Flora.

104
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,110
He'll never care about anything
but test tubes and chemicals.

105
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,960
How can he go away like this
without a word?

106
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,560
Flora, dear. Please, darling,
let me tell you how I feel.

107
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:37,560
- I can't work or sleep until I know.
- Leave me alone! How can you?

109
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:03,840
There's a way back, you fool.

110
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,040
There must be a way back.

112
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:08,720
- What is it?
- Your luncheon.

113
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,270
- Take it away.
- You don't want it cold, do you?

114
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:16,590
Do you suppose that I'm going to carry
trays backwards and forwards all day?

115
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,990
Luncheon's at one, and it's one now!

116
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,360
Get out!

118
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:36,800
He's not gonna stay under this roof,
not another hour!

119
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:39,760
Crashed the tray out of me hand,
and swore at me.

120
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,280
Turns my best sitting room
into a chemist's shop.

121
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:47,230
Spillages on the carpets!
And him a week behind with his money!

122
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,310
Go and tell him if he ain't
packed up and gone in half an hour,

123
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,790
we'll have the law in to turn him out.

124
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:54,840
And take him his bill.

125
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:59,680
Three pounds ten.
And see you get it before you come out.

126
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,590
Go on.

127
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,150
Let's leave him a bit, Jenny,
till he cools off.

128
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,630
Go on, do it now. Him and his goggles
and his chemist's shop!

129
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:12,560
If you don't kick him out, I'm clearing out
myself, and I mean it this time!

130
00:12:21,080 --> 00:12:26,240
And a whole day's work ruined
by a foolish, ignorant woman!

131
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:36,280
There must be a way back.

132
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,240
- God knows there's a way back.

133
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,880
If only they'd leave me alone.

134
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:50,430
Look 'ere, mister,
we can't have this no more.

135
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:54,150
You broke the wife's best china, you're
behind with the rent. Pack up and go.

136
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,870
I'm expecting some money, Mr Hall.
I'll pay you directly it comes.

137
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,950
You said that last week.

138
00:13:00,040 --> 00:13:04,960
I came here for quiet and secrecy.
I'm carrying out a difficult experiment.

139
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,400
I must be left alone. It's vital. It's life
and death that I should be left alone.

140
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,470
- You don't understand.
- I understand all right.

141
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,110
You don't pay. And what's more,
you're driving folks away from our house.

142
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,640
Mr Hall, I've had a serious accident.

143
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,720
It's disfigured me, affected my eyes.

144
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,040
I mean the way you carry on, throwing
things about on the carpets and swearing.

145
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:35,910
- It's no good, mister, you've got to go.
- I implore you to let me stay. I beg of you.

146
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,040
The wife says if you don't go, she is,
so it's gotta be you.

147
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:42,670
Come on. I'll help you
to get this stuff packed up.

148
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:50,240
Leave that alone and get out of here!

149
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,840
Look here! Is this my house or yours?

150
00:13:58,440 --> 00:13:59,800
What are you doing?

152
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,310
Help! Help! Police!

154
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,720
He's a raving lunatic!

155
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,840
Go and get a policeman.

156
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:21,520
Please don't cry, now.

157
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,600
- He's all right.

158
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,590
Oh, shut up!

159
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,710
- Come on, Jaffers!
- Here, what's all this?

160
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,710
It's the stranger with the goggles.

161
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:36,350
He's gone mad. He's assaulted Mrs Hall
and nearly killed her husband.

162
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,640
Oh.

163
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,630
- Where is he?
- He's upstairs in the sitting room.

164
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:54,280
He's in there, in the sitting room.
He's homicidal.

165
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,270
Oh.

166
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:03,350
Let that there.

168
00:15:16,920 --> 00:15:19,150
Here, keep back, you kids there.

169
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:32,080
- Here, what's all this?
- Keep back there.

170
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:35,440
Keep back, me?
Do you know who you're talking to?

171
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,120
I give you a last chance
to leave me alone.

172
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,750
Give me a last chance? You've committed
assault, that's what you've done,

173
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:45,070
and you can come along
to the station with me.

174
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:49,600
Come along, now. Come quietly, unless
you want me to put the handcuffs on.

175
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:52,480
Stop where you are.
You don't know what you're doing.

176
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,840
I know what I'm doing all right. Come on.

177
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:56,640
- Get hold of him.
- Lock him up!

178
00:15:56,720 --> 00:15:59,520
All right, you fools.

179
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,070
You've brought it on yourselves.

180
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:05,520
Everything would have come right
if you'd only left me alone.

181
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,230
You've driven me near madness
with your peering through the keyholes

182
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,310
and gaping through the curtains.

183
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:13,600
And now you'll suffer for it!

184
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,990
You're crazy to know who I am,
aren't you?

185
00:16:17,080 --> 00:16:19,840
All right! I'll show you!

186
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:23,240
There's a souvenir for you.

187
00:16:23,800 --> 00:16:26,000
And one for you.

188
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:28,390
I'll show you who I am and what I am.

190
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:35,640
Look. He's all eaten away.

191
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,590
How do you like that, eh?

194
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,840
- It was 'orrible.
- What's wrong?

195
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:55,920
- Jaffers, what do you think?
- He's invisible, that's what's the matter.

196
00:16:56,000 --> 00:17:01,360
If he gets the rest of them clothes off,
we'll never catch him in a thousand years.

197
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:03,430
Come on.

198
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,760
They've asked for it,
the country bumpkins.

199
00:17:07,840 --> 00:17:10,200
This'll give them a bit of a shock.

200
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:12,430
Something to write home about.

201
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,040
A nice bedtime story for the kids,
too, if they want it.

203
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,560
- Put the handcuffs on.
- How can I handcuff a bloomin' shirt?

204
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:27,000
- Quick! Get hold of him!

205
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,720
Ow!

206
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:41,830
Are you satisfied now, you fools?

207
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,080
It's easy, really, if you're clever.

208
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,720
A few chemicals mixed together,
that's all,

209
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:52,270
and flesh and blood and bone
just fade away.

210
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,070
A little of this injected under the skin
of the arm every day for a month.

211
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:58,600
An invisible man can rule the world.

212
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,360
Nobody will see him come,
nobody will see him go.

213
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:05,400
He can hear every secret.
He can rob and kill!

214
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:09,720
Not if he can't get no further
than this room, he won't.

215
00:18:09,800 --> 00:18:11,710
Here, shut that door.

216
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:17,240
- You'd better come along quietly.

217
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,840
Look out! Mind that window!

218
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,280
You think I'd escape
like a common criminal?

219
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:28,350
You need a lesson.

220
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,350
I think I'll throttle you.

221
00:18:31,240 --> 00:18:33,550
Let go of me!

222
00:18:33,640 --> 00:18:35,550
Let go!

223
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:41,200
You must be made to understand
what I can do.

224
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,630
Hey, look out!

226
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,920
Hey, whoa!

227
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,190
Hey, hey!

228
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,640
Look out! Get indoors!

229
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:06,630
Everybody get indoors!

231
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:13,040
I'm afraid I need this bicycle. Ha-ha!

232
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:17,160
He stole me bike!

233
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:25,400
Here's your blooming bicycle.
You can do what you like with it.

234
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:28,200
How's that for a hairbrush, George Henry?

235
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,920
Good morning, Grandfather.
How do you do?

236
00:19:33,800 --> 00:19:35,760
We'll do our part.

237
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:40,320
Mama, give me the diamonds!

238
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:42,630
On the gospel, it's the truth.

239
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,630
He tried to strangle me, sir.

240
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:47,280
Where are you speaking from, Jaffers?

241
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,480
Lion's Head inn, eh?

242
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,840
Did you say an invisible man?

243
00:19:51,920 --> 00:19:55,310
Well, look here, you put
more water in it next time!

244
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,840
He won't believe me. You tell him.

245
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:01,120
Mr Hall speaking.
The constable's telling the truth all right.

246
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,200
Not the slightest clue.

247
00:20:10,280 --> 00:20:12,800
I didn't expect there would be.

248
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,440
That's where the clues are.
He wasn't leaving anything to chance.

249
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:23,830
Griffin was never the man for secrets.
He came to me with everything.

250
00:20:23,920 --> 00:20:26,830
He kept a lot of stuff locked in here.

251
00:20:26,920 --> 00:20:29,680
I came in one evening
when he wasn't expecting me.

252
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:32,200
He was by this cupboard.
It was full of instruments.

253
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:35,670
When he saw me, he slammed the door
and turned the key.

254
00:20:39,720 --> 00:20:41,710
You say he brought
a packing case up here?

255
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:47,000
The night before he disappeared. I heard
him hammering, packing everything up.

256
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:52,190
- Here's something, Kemp.
- What is it?

257
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:55,560
- Bad news?
- It's only a rough note.

258
00:20:55,640 --> 00:21:00,080
A list of chemicals,
and the last on the list is monocane.

259
00:21:00,160 --> 00:21:03,150
Monocane? What is monocane?

260
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:06,040
- Monocane's a terrible drug.
- I never heard of it.

261
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:10,160
You wouldn't, Kemp. It's never used now.
I didn't know it was even made.

262
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:13,600
It's a drug that's made from
a flower that's grown in India.

263
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:16,280
It draws colour
from everything it touches.

264
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:18,880
Years ago they tried it for bleaching cloth.

265
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:21,720
They gave it up because
it destroyed the material.

266
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:25,800
- That doesn't sound very terrible.
- I know, but it does something else.

267
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:28,760
It was tried out on some poor animal -
a dog, I believe.

268
00:21:28,840 --> 00:21:30,800
It was injected under the skin,

269
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:35,030
and it turned the dog dead white,
like a marble statue.

270
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:38,880
- Is that so?
- Yes, and it also sent it raving mad.

271
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,320
You surely don't think...?

272
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,360
I only pray to God that Griffin hasn't
been meddling with this ghastly stuff.

273
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:47,320
- He'd never touch a thing with madness.
- He might not know.

274
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,550
I found that experiment
in an old German book just by chance.

275
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,240
The English books only describe
the bleaching power.

276
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,480
- What are we going to do?
- Tell the police that Griffin's disappeared.

277
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:04,000
But only that he's disappeared.

278
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:08,760
I put you on your honour, Kemp,
not to breathe a word of this to anyone.

279
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,480
- Shall I go with you?
- It's all right, Kemp.

280
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:19,950
I'll go tonight,
when Inspector Lane's on duty.

281
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:22,030
I'll run along back home, then.

282
00:22:23,960 --> 00:22:25,920
- Good night.
- Good night, Kemp.

284
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,600
This is the national station
broadcasting this evening's news.

285
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:02,750
Remarkable story from country village.

286
00:23:02,840 --> 00:23:05,280
Police and doctors
are investigating a story

287
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,040
told this afternoon by
the people of the village of lping.

288
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:12,670
A mysterious disease has broken out
infecting many of the inhabitants.

289
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:16,600
It takes the form of a delusion that
an invisible man is living among them.

290
00:23:16,680 --> 00:23:18,960
Several people have been
seriously injured,

291
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:23,720
probably through fighting, in their belief
that their opponent is an invisible man.

292
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,600
The whole village is
in a state of panic and everyone...

293
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:29,120
Everyone deserves the fate
that's coming to them.

294
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,320
Panic, death, things worse than death.

295
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,470
Don't be afraid, Kemp.

296
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:38,000
It's me - Griffin. Jack Griffin.

297
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,310
How are you, my friend?

298
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,840
Brrr! I'm frozen with cold.

299
00:23:42,920 --> 00:23:45,760
Dead tired. Thank God for a fire.

301
00:23:54,040 --> 00:23:57,590
Sit down, you fool.
Let's have a decent fire.

302
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,470
D'you hear me? Sit down, unless
you want me to knock your brains out.

303
00:24:08,560 --> 00:24:10,470
Sit down!

304
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,590
I want you to listen carefully, Kemp.
I've been through hell today.

305
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:25,070
I want food and sleep, but before
we sleep, there's work to do.

306
00:24:25,160 --> 00:24:28,150
May I have a cigarette?

307
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,470
You always were
a dirty little coward, Kemp.

308
00:24:32,560 --> 00:24:35,550
You're frightened
out of your wits, aren't you?

309
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:40,790
Oh, it's no good talking like this.

310
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,520
Have you got a good long
surgical bandage?

311
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,800
Good. And a pair of dark glasses?

312
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:53,240
Right. Go and get them, at once.

313
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:57,870
Let me have a dressing gown
and pyjamas and a pair of gloves.

314
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:01,480
You'll feel better
if you can see me, won't you?

315
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:09,150
Come on. You've no time to waste.

317
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:31,760
You'll find some pyjamas in that room.

318
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:33,990
Here are the gloves and bandages.

319
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,710
- I'll bring you the glasses.
- Thank you. Don't be long.

320
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,590
Put them on the table.

321
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:58,960
Now go down and draw the blinds
in your sitting room.

322
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:02,470
- Are we alone in the house?
- Yes.

323
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:07,270
Good. All right, go now. If you raise
a finger against me, you're a dead man.

324
00:26:07,360 --> 00:26:10,350
I'm strong and I'll strangle you.

325
00:26:10,440 --> 00:26:13,640
Understand? Wait for me downstairs.

326
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:26,440
The sitting room, I said, Kemp.

327
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:29,640
And if you try and escape by the window,
I shall follow you,

328
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:32,280
and no one in the world can save you.

329
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,680
Here comes the inspector now.

330
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:04,470
Get up.

331
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:10,950
Nice fool you've made of me.

332
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:14,750
I've got reports for ten miles around.
Not a sign of anything.

333
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:19,320
I'll tell you what I think
of your invisible man: It's a hoax.

334
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:24,630
Good business for the saloon bar,
eh, Mr Hall?

335
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,440
Suppose I'd break my neck
to sell a gallon of beer?

336
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:29,640
I'll have an inquiry right now.

337
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:32,760
Bring in everybody who thinks
they saw or heard anything.

338
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:34,720
I'll get to the bottom of this.

339
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:37,240
Get those tables together.

340
00:27:51,120 --> 00:27:53,430
Now, Kemp.

341
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:09,880
Now then, we can talk as man to man.

342
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,950
Sit down.

343
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:46,480
One day I'll tell you everything.
There's no time now.

344
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:49,200
I began five years ago in secret,

345
00:28:49,280 --> 00:28:52,270
working all night, every night,
right into the dawn.

346
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:55,640
A thousand experiments,
a thousand failures,

347
00:28:55,720 --> 00:29:00,270
and then at last the great, wonderful day.

348
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:04,360
- But, Griffin, it's ghastly!
- The great, wonderful day.

349
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,910
The last little mixture of drugs.
I couldn't stay here any longer, Kemp.

350
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,680
I couldn't let you see me
slowly fading away.

351
00:29:11,760 --> 00:29:14,720
So I packed up and went to a village
for secrecy and quiet,

352
00:29:14,800 --> 00:29:17,560
to finish the experiment
and complete the antidote,

353
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,790
the way back to visible man again.

354
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:22,950
I meant to come back
just as I was when you saw me last.

355
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:27,720
But the fools wouldn't let me work
in peace. I had to teach them a lesson.

356
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,920
But why? Why do it, Griffin?

357
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,440
Just a scientific experiment at first.

358
00:29:32,520 --> 00:29:36,800
That's all. To do something
no other man in the world had done.

359
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:40,190
But there's more to it than that, Kemp.
I know now.

360
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:44,720
It came to me suddenly. The drugs I took
seemed to light up my brain.

361
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,320
Suddenly I realised the power I held,

362
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,030
the power to rule,
to make the world grovel at my feet.

364
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:58,600
We'll soon put the world right now, Kemp.
You and I.

365
00:29:58,680 --> 00:30:00,400
I? You mean...?

366
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,120
I must have a partner, Kemp,

367
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,560
a visible partner,
to help me in the little things.

368
00:30:07,960 --> 00:30:10,030
You're my partner, Kemp.

369
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:14,030
We'll begin with a reign of terror.

370
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:16,560
A few murders here and there.

371
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:19,320
Murders of great men,
murders of little men,

372
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,760
just to show we make no distinction.

373
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:24,230
We might even wreck a train or two.

374
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:30,080
Just these fingers
round a signalman's throat, that's all.

375
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,200
Griffin, for heaven's sake!

376
00:30:32,280 --> 00:30:35,080
- Do you want me to take these off?
- No, no.

377
00:30:35,160 --> 00:30:37,280
Very well, then.

378
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,350
We'll make our plans tomorrow.

379
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,120
Tonight we have a small job to do.
Go and get your car out, Kemp.

380
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,160
- Where are we going?
- To the village I left this morning.

381
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:50,200
I came away without my notebooks. They
contain all the results of my experiments.

382
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:53,120
- But it's past eight o'clock.
- It's only 15 miles.

383
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:56,960
Go now. Quickly.
Take a bag with you for the books.

384
00:31:02,720 --> 00:31:07,560
Put a warm rug in the car. It's cold outside
when you have to go about naked.

385
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:19,080
- All ready?
- Yes.

386
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,360
Come on! Get in!

387
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:30,990
- Where's that rug?
- In the back.

388
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:35,280
I'm frozen. It's cold enough
to freeze the icicles off an Eskimo.

389
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,750
We'll stop in a lane near the inn. I'll give
you the books through the window.

390
00:31:40,840 --> 00:31:43,960
- They'll have a guard.
- What can a guard do, you fool?

391
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:48,400
I must have those books, Kemp. I'll work
in your laboratory till I find the antidote.

392
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:51,680
Sometimes I'll make you invisible,
give me a rest.

393
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:53,640
I was walking home to me lunch, sir,

394
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:58,480
when all of a sudden something takes
hold of me hat and throws it in the pond.

395
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:02,600
- How many drinks did you have?
- Only a couple, sir, that's all.

396
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,560
A couple of drinks and a gust of wind.
So much for you.

397
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:10,790
Now then, about the bicycle.
Where's the owner of the bicycle?

398
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,680
Here, sir.
It was pulled clean out of me hands, sir.

399
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:16,400
Then it pedalled off
down the street, all by itself.

400
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,640
Stop here.

401
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:24,240
Come on, get out.

402
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:30,400
Take your bag and walk down the street.
I'll guide you.

403
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:32,790
Wait outside the window
till the books come out.

404
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:36,560
Put them in your bag and come back
to the car. Then wait for me.

405
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,840
Don't stare at me, you fool.
Look in front of you.

406
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,830
Come on! Get a move on.

407
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:46,630
Here we are, Kemp, in here.

408
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:58,040
Here. Stroll up and down
as though you were waiting for someone.

409
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,510
Watch for that window to open.

410
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:07,070
Griffin? Griffin? Are you there?

411
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:21,470
- Who's that, opened that door?
- It's them boys again, sir.

413
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:28,190
Here, you leave this door alone!
It's private, see!

414
00:33:28,280 --> 00:33:30,720
- Aw, we never touched it.
- Yes, you did.

415
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:32,710
Go on, hop it. Go on!

417
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,270
There you are, Kemp.

418
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,960
Lies from beginning to end!

419
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:12,720
I've a good mind to prosecute
all of you for conspiracy.

420
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:15,790
I shall announce this evening
that the whole thing's a hoax,

421
00:34:15,880 --> 00:34:19,160
and you'll be the laughing stock
of the entire country.

422
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:29,910
He's here! The invisible man!

425
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,990
Don't leave me! Wait for me!

426
00:34:57,080 --> 00:34:59,360
Don't leave me! Wait for me!

427
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:05,470
A hoax, is it? All a hoax?

428
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,470
All a hoax?

429
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,680
There.

432
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:18,280
All right. Off you go.

433
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:21,550
Go for your life, too.

434
00:35:23,960 --> 00:35:27,030
- Did you hear shouting and screaming?
- What was that screaming?

435
00:35:27,120 --> 00:35:30,560
I had to take some exercise to keep warm.
I killed a stupid policeman.

436
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,840
Smashed his head in.

437
00:35:32,920 --> 00:35:35,600
We start in earnest
tomorrow morning, Kemp.

438
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:41,070
- Good evening, Doctor.
- Is Inspector Lane at the station?

439
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,230
- I want a word with him.
- Yes, sir.

440
00:35:43,360 --> 00:35:46,880
Extra special!
Invisible man slays policeman!

442
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:08,910
- Nasty business, this.
- It's a conjuring trick, that's what it is.

443
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,600
I saw a fella
make a peanut disappear once.

444
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:17,000
There are one or two things
you must understand, Kemp.

445
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:21,310
I must always remain in hiding
for an hour after meals.

446
00:36:21,400 --> 00:36:25,110
The food is visible inside me
until it is digested.

447
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:28,430
I can only work on fine, clear days.

448
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,400
If I work in the rain, the water
can be seen on my head and shoulders.

449
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:35,360
In a fog you can see me, like a bubble.

450
00:36:36,280 --> 00:36:40,800
In smoky cities the soot settles on me
until you can see a dark outline.

451
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:45,040
You must always be near at hand
to wipe off my feet.

452
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,560
Even dirt between my fingernails
would give me away.

453
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:51,550
It is difficult at first to walk down stairs.

454
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:53,760
We are so accustomed
to watching our feet.

455
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:59,280
But these are trivial difficulties. We shall
find ways of defeating everything.

456
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:01,190
You will sleep in the room opposite.

457
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:04,320
And bring me some more food
at eight o'clock.

458
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,750
Good night.

461
00:38:30,760 --> 00:38:33,070
Now you will understand my plans.

462
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:35,760
You're in charge of all country
to the east, Thompson,

463
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,440
- for 20 miles to the north of the road.
- Very good, sir.

464
00:38:38,520 --> 00:38:41,430
Neville, you take
the opposite section to the south.

465
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,590
Stoland, you take charge
of the search in the hills.

466
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:48,960
And, Hogan, you take all the villages,
out to the river.

467
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,320
Now, we shall comb the country
for 20 miles round.

468
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:57,840
We've got a terrible responsibility.
He's mad and he's invisible.

469
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:03,080
He may be standing beside us now.
But he's human and we shall get him.

470
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:06,030
We shall have 1,000 men out tonight.

471
00:39:06,120 --> 00:39:09,240
Tomorrow we shall have
10,000 volunteers to help them.

472
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:12,390
There's a broadcast warning
going out at 10.30.

473
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:16,000
Now, at all costs,
we must avoid a panic spreading.

474
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,440
Get word to your districts,
and send me a note of your headquarters.

475
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:25,230
And remember, he'll leave tracks,
even if he himself is invisible.

476
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:34,120
I must interrupt the music for a moment.
I have an urgent message from the police.

477
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:37,480
Earlier this evening we broadcast
a report of an invisible man.

478
00:39:37,560 --> 00:39:41,030
The report has now been confirmed.
It appears that an unknown man

479
00:39:41,120 --> 00:39:43,920
by scientific means
has made himself invisible.

480
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,630
He has attacked and killed
a police inspector and is now at large.

481
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:51,080
The chief of police appeals
to the public for help and assistance.

482
00:39:51,160 --> 00:39:56,520
Those willing to cooperate are requested
to report tomorrow to their local station.

483
00:39:56,600 --> 00:40:00,310
The invisible man works without clothing.
He will have to seek shelter.

484
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:02,840
You're requested to lock
every door and window,

485
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:05,440
and every outbuilding
he may use to hide in.

486
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:10,150
The police will be glad of any suggestions
that will help in capturing the fugitive.

487
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,120
Remember, he's solid but cannot be seen.

488
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:15,640
A reward of 1,000
will be given to any person

489
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,870
whose information leads to his capture.

490
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:20,600
The police appeal
to the public to keep calm

491
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,880
and to admit uniformed
search parties to all property.

494
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:38,950
- I've got the doors padlocked.
- I'll keep him out!

495
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:09,920
Hello.

496
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,310
Hello. Get me Esher, 1021.

498
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:20,110
Hello?

499
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:23,400
Doctor, it's something ghastly.
It's Griffin. He's come back.

500
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:26,080
He's the invisible man.
He's asleep in my room.

501
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,280
He's mad, a raving lunatic.
He's killed a man tonight.

502
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,040
Listen to me, Kemp.
No one but you and I know that it's Griffin.

503
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:36,960
- I shall come in the morning.
- You must come now. I can't bear it!

504
00:41:37,040 --> 00:41:39,510
If I come now,
he'll be suspicious and escape.

505
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:43,600
You must keep him calm and quiet
for tonight. I trust you, Kemp.

506
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,320
- Who was that, Father?
- It was Kemp.

507
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:55,000
It was about Jack. I know it.

508
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:56,960
What is it? Tell me.

509
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:02,440
- Leave me alone, Flora, please.
- I'm not afraid. Tell me.

510
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:06,280
Jack Griffin's come back.
He's at Dr Kemp's house now.

511
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:09,000
Jack Griffin's the invisible man.

512
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,760
Is that the police?
Was that 1,000 reward all right?

513
00:42:12,840 --> 00:42:15,150
Well, listen, I've got a way to catch him.

514
00:42:15,240 --> 00:42:17,800
The paper says he threw ink
at the man he killed.

515
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:21,270
Get your own back and squirt ink about
with a hose pipe till you hit him.

516
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:23,640
The ink'll stick on him.
Then you can shoot him.

517
00:42:23,720 --> 00:42:27,320
Is that the police? I wanna tell you
how to catch the invisible man.

518
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,840
The paper says it's going to be
frosty in a day or two.

519
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,630
Well, you watch out when there's frost,
see, then you can see his breath.

520
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:37,230
Police, quickly.

521
00:42:37,720 --> 00:42:40,320
Is this the police? This is Dr Kemp.

522
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:44,950
The invisible man is in my house,
asleep upstairs. Come at once. Hurry!

523
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,190
But, listen, Doctor,
I've only got five men here.

524
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:50,590
I'd want 100 to surround the house.

525
00:42:50,680 --> 00:42:53,440
Yes, all right. I'll send them up
as soon as possible.

526
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:58,040
Leave it to me and Kemp. We shall work
day and night to undo this experiment.

527
00:42:58,120 --> 00:43:00,880
- You must let me go to him.
- Only when he's well again.

528
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,920
No, now. I can do far more
with Jack than you or Dr Kemp.

529
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:08,080
But, Flora, he's not normal.
His mind's unhinged. At present he's mad.

530
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:11,870
I can persuade him to help you.
You're powerless unless he does.

531
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,950
- I'll be ready in five minutes.
- Wait till the morning.

532
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:17,480
It's life or death, Father. You know that.

533
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,230
- I'll go alone, then.
- Flora.

535
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:27,360
Who's that? Who's that?

536
00:43:27,440 --> 00:43:30,320
Unlock the door, Kemp.
Let me in.

537
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:44,030
- What are you doing here, Kemp?
- I couldn't sleep.

538
00:43:44,120 --> 00:43:46,000
I had to get up and come down.

539
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:50,630
- Why did you lock the door?
- I... I was afraid.

540
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:53,440
Wouldn't you be afraid
if I were invisible like you?

541
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:55,750
There's no need to be afraid, Kemp.

542
00:43:55,840 --> 00:43:58,720
We're partners. Bosom friends.

543
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:01,400
We've a busy day ahead.

544
00:44:01,480 --> 00:44:03,390
You must sleep.

546
00:44:18,080 --> 00:44:22,920
I see. You told the police.
That was why you went downstairs.

547
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:25,600
No, I didn't. I swear I didn't.

548
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:29,040
Look, it's not the police.
It's Dr Cranley and Flora.

549
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:33,030
Flora.

550
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:37,080
- Why, yes, of course.
- I had to tell them you were back, Griffin.

551
00:44:37,160 --> 00:44:40,360
- Flora was nearly mad with anxiety.
- How could I forget?

553
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:44,150
Shall I let them in?

554
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:47,080
Yes, of course you must let them in.

555
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:50,040
I shall go and prepare myself in my room.

556
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,190
I shall see Flora. Alone.

557
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:09,800
- He knows you're here.
- He was asleep.

558
00:45:09,880 --> 00:45:12,760
He saw you from the window.
He wants to see Flora alone.

559
00:45:12,840 --> 00:45:15,070
- No, Flora, don't.
- He's calm now, and quiet.

560
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:17,520
- Jack won't do me any harm.
- He's insane.

561
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:20,400
It's for us to cure him - Kemp and I.
Keep away, Flora.

562
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,390
I must go to him.

563
00:45:24,360 --> 00:45:27,670
Doctor, he was a different man
when he saw Flora leave the car.

564
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:30,440
He won't hurt her. We must play for time.

565
00:45:30,520 --> 00:45:33,430
- Why for time?
- We... we must prepare things.

566
00:45:33,520 --> 00:45:35,880
If we try and bind him now, he'll escape.

567
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:40,000
We must take him when he's asleep
and chloroform him. Wait here.

568
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:51,960
- Flora, my darling.
- Thank God you're home, Jack.

569
00:45:52,040 --> 00:45:55,510
I would have come to you at once,
Flora, but for this.

570
00:45:55,600 --> 00:45:57,720
How wonderful it is to see you.

571
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:06,120
How beautiful you look.

572
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:10,640
That funny little hat. I always liked it.

573
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,870
- You've been crying.
- I want to help you. Why did you do this?

574
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,080
- For you, Flora.
- For me?

575
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,040
Yes, for you, my darling.
I wanted to do something tremendous,

576
00:46:21,120 --> 00:46:24,670
to achieve what men of science
have dreamt of since the world began,

577
00:46:24,760 --> 00:46:26,800
to gain wealth and fame and honour,

578
00:46:26,880 --> 00:46:30,560
to write my name above
the greatest scientists of all time.

579
00:46:30,640 --> 00:46:35,670
I was so pitifully poor.
I had nothing to offer you, Flora.

580
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:38,360
I was just a poor, struggling chemist.

581
00:46:38,440 --> 00:46:41,430
I shall come back to you,
Flora, very soon now.

582
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:44,200
The secret of invisibility
lies there in my books.

583
00:46:44,280 --> 00:46:47,270
I shall work in Kemp's laboratory
till I find the way back.

584
00:46:47,360 --> 00:46:50,830
There is a way back, Flora.
And then I shall come to you.

585
00:46:50,920 --> 00:46:54,800
I shall offer my secret to the world,
with all its terrible power!

586
00:46:54,880 --> 00:46:57,840
The nations of the world will bid for it -
thousands, millions.

587
00:46:57,920 --> 00:47:03,280
The nation that wins my secret can
sweep the world with invisible armies!

588
00:47:03,360 --> 00:47:07,040
Jack, I want you to let my father help you.
You know how clever he is.

589
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:11,880
He'll work with you until you find that
second secret that'll bring you back to us.

590
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,320
Then we'll have lovely,
peaceful days again

591
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:17,040
out under the trees,
after your work in the evening.

592
00:47:17,120 --> 00:47:21,160
Your father? Clever? 
You think he can help me?

593
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:25,200
He's got the brain of a tapeworm,
a maggot, beside mine.

594
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,840
Don't you see what it means? Power.

595
00:47:27,920 --> 00:47:31,310
Power to rule, to make
the world grovel at my feet.

596
00:47:31,400 --> 00:47:35,760
Jack, listen to me. Listen!
My father found a note in your room.

597
00:47:35,840 --> 00:47:38,360
He knows something about monocane
you don't.

598
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:41,910
It alters you, changes you,
makes you feel differently.

599
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,800
Father believes its power will go
if you know what it is.

600
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,030
Come and stay with us.
Let's fight this thing out together.

601
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:50,270
Power, I said.

602
00:47:50,360 --> 00:47:53,040
Power to walk into the gold vaults
of the nations,

603
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:56,880
into the secrets of kings,
into the holy of holies.

604
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,030
Power to make multitudes
run squealing in terror

605
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:03,480
at the touch of my little invisible finger.

606
00:48:03,560 --> 00:48:06,870
Even the moon's frightened of me,
frightened to death.

607
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,600
The whole world's frightened to death.

609
00:48:22,920 --> 00:48:26,800
So, I see. Kemp couldn't sleep.

610
00:48:26,880 --> 00:48:29,520
He had to go downstairs.
He was frightened.

611
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,400
I put my trust in Kemp.

612
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,520
I told him my secret
and he gave me his word of honour.

613
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,750
- You must go now, Flora.
- I want to help you.

614
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:39,070
There is nothing for you to do
except to go.

615
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:44,000
I shall come back. I swear I shall
come back, because I shall defeat them.

616
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,120
- Go now, my dear.
- No. I want to stay. You must hide.

617
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:54,190
Don't worry.
The whole world's my hiding place.

618
00:48:54,280 --> 00:48:59,070
I can stand out there amongst them
in the day or night and laugh at them.

619
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,640
Come along, my darling.

620
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:18,110
Oh, Father!

621
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:22,510
Link hands, all around the house.

622
00:49:22,600 --> 00:49:24,800
- Link hands.
- Link hands.

623
00:49:25,080 --> 00:49:27,840
- Link hands.
- Link hands.

624
00:49:27,920 --> 00:49:31,310
Keep close together,
or he'll slip under your arm.

625
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:33,960
Now, boys, forward.

626
00:49:46,800 --> 00:49:49,950
Thank you, Kemp,
for opening the window.

627
00:49:50,040 --> 00:49:53,160
You're a true friend, Kemp. A man to trust.

628
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:55,390
I've no time now but, believe me,

629
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:58,320
as surely as the moon will set
and the sun will rise,

630
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,760
I shall kill you tomorrow night.

631
00:50:00,840 --> 00:50:04,760
I shall kill you even if you hide
in the deepest cave of the earth.

632
00:50:04,840 --> 00:50:08,800
At ten o'clock tomorrow night
I shall kill you.

633
00:50:10,720 --> 00:50:12,470
Help! Help!

634
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:14,470
He's here! He's here!

635
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:18,230
- Here he comes.
- Stand where you are.

636
00:50:19,560 --> 00:50:21,790
- What is it?
- Something smacked my face.

638
00:50:23,080 --> 00:50:25,680
Naughty boy.

639
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:27,430
Ow! Let go!

640
00:50:27,520 --> 00:50:29,990
- What's the matter with you?
- He twisted my nose.

641
00:50:30,080 --> 00:50:33,440
Now, steady, boys.
We've got him all right this time.

642
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:36,350
Good shot.

644
00:50:40,160 --> 00:50:42,880
Get that hat.
Now then, boys, advance slowly.

645
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:46,190
It's all right. He's unarmed.
We've got him easy.

646
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:52,680
Help! Help! He's got me by the feet!

647
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:54,750
Here he is! Help!

649
00:50:57,160 --> 00:51:01,200
It's the invisible man! He's got him
by the feet! After him! Quick!

650
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:19,040
What do you know about that?

652
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,190
Help!

653
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,270
Murder! Murder!

654
00:51:27,960 --> 00:51:31,670
# Here we go gathering nuts in May,
nuts in May, nuts in May

655
00:51:31,760 --> 00:51:35,910
# Here we go gathering nuts in May
on a cold and frosty morning

656
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:37,070
Whoops!

657
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:42,560
He threatened to kill me at ten o'clock
tonight. You must lock me up.

658
00:51:42,640 --> 00:51:44,920
You're not the only one
in danger, Dr Kemp.

659
00:51:45,000 --> 00:51:47,440
I'll see that you have protection.

660
00:51:47,800 --> 00:51:51,240
Now, Dr Cranley,
you're concealing something from me.

661
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:52,600
One moment.

662
00:51:52,680 --> 00:51:56,800
Why were you and your daughter
in this house at two o'clock this morning?

663
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:59,560
Dr Kemp called me up.
He told me the man was here.

664
00:51:59,640 --> 00:52:02,550
- He wanted my help.
- Why did he ring you before the police?

665
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,190
- Why did your daughter come too?
- She came to drive the car.

666
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:08,670
You know who
the invisible man is, Doctor.

667
00:52:12,560 --> 00:52:17,350
I understand you have another assistant
besides Dr Kemp, a Dr Griffin.

668
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:20,720
- Where is Dr Griffin?
- He's gone away.

669
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:23,110
It is Griffin!
What's the good of concealing it?

670
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:25,720
It's Griffin,
and he's threatened to murder me.

671
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:28,790
He may be here now, in the garden
looking through the window,

672
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:31,920
or in the corner of my bedroom
waiting for me, waiting to kill me!

673
00:52:32,000 --> 00:52:34,560
And you all sit there
doing nothing! Nothing!

674
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:37,280
We've doubled the search party
around Kemp's house.

675
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:41,590
Nothing to report, sir. The policeman's
trousers were found a mile away.

676
00:52:41,680 --> 00:52:44,280
- That's all.
- Well, it's beaten me.

677
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:48,640
I'll give 1,000 for a practical idea.

678
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:52,000
He's roaming the country at will,
a madman.

679
00:52:56,480 --> 00:52:59,870
Here I am.
Aren't you pleased you've found me?

680
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,110
Aagh!

681
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:09,960
Would you like
to keep him company?

682
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:13,390
Stand away! Keep back!

684
00:53:44,240 --> 00:53:45,760
Thank you.

685
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:48,720
- Give me 5 worth of silver, please.
- Yes, sir.

686
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:50,710
Thank you. Good day.

687
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:56,080
- Morning.
- Morning, sir.

688
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:03,040
There you are. A present
from the invisible man.

689
00:54:03,120 --> 00:54:04,640
Money! Money! Money! Money!

691
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,920
# Up and down the City Road

692
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:12,590
# In and out the Eagle

693
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:14,350
# That's the way the money goes

694
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:15,960
# Pop goes the weasel!

695
00:54:16,040 --> 00:54:18,000
Money! Money! Money! Money!

696
00:54:18,080 --> 00:54:20,840
20 men of the search parties
have been killed,

697
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:22,750
and 100 in the train disaster.

698
00:54:22,840 --> 00:54:26,630
The invisible man has been reported
in a hundred different places.

699
00:54:26,720 --> 00:54:29,280
Now I appeal to you to help us
keep the public calm.

700
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,560
What plans have you got
for capturing him?

701
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,920
100,000 men are searching and watching.

702
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:36,470
But have you any special
secret means of getting him?

703
00:54:36,560 --> 00:54:40,110
The police have offered 2,000
for the first effective means.

704
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:43,590
- Why not bloodhounds?
- The bloodhounds have lost the scent.

705
00:54:43,680 --> 00:54:47,280
Why not put wet tar on all the roads,
then chase the black soles of his feet?

706
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:51,670
Because he's not a fool.
Now, we've got one hope, gentlemen.

707
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:53,960
But I daren't say a word of it here.

708
00:54:54,040 --> 00:54:56,950
He may be standing there
beside you listening.

709
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,550
Try and sleep now, my dear.

710
00:55:05,120 --> 00:55:06,710
There's nothing you can do.

711
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:10,950
We must just pray that the police
can take him without harming him.

712
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:27,400
Stand back, close against the wall.

713
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,270
Now then.

714
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:35,880
Drag that net clear across the room.

715
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:39,840
Now everything depends on
the way we carry out my plan.

716
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:43,120
I'll tell you it after we've made certain
he's not in this room.

717
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,080
Good. Now we're safe here at last.

718
00:55:46,160 --> 00:55:48,760
Constable, keep an eye on that window.

719
00:55:48,840 --> 00:55:51,750
Now, come here. All of you, sit down.

720
00:56:00,520 --> 00:56:05,310
Now listen carefully. We've got a chance
tonight that will never come again.

721
00:56:05,400 --> 00:56:08,550
He's threatened to murder
Dr Kemp at ten o'clock.

722
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:11,870
From what we know of him,
he'll do his utmost to carry that out.

723
00:56:11,960 --> 00:56:16,400
He's certain to be near this house,
watching, for some time beforehand.

724
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:20,950
Now, at half past nine,
Dr Kemp, with a bodyguard of police,

725
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:24,030
will leave this house
and walk down to the police station.

726
00:56:24,120 --> 00:56:27,160
It's a natural thing
for Dr Kemp to seek protection.

727
00:56:27,240 --> 00:56:31,360
The invisible man is certain to be near.
He's certain to see what's happening.

728
00:56:31,440 --> 00:56:33,880
You mean you're going to
use me as a bait? I can't!

729
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,840
- You must. You'll be perfectly safe.
- Safe? He's not human.

730
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:40,040
- He can go through prison walls.
- Don't be a fool.

731
00:56:40,120 --> 00:56:42,190
I can't sit in that station waiting.

732
00:56:42,280 --> 00:56:46,320
He'll kill you, kill you all,
and then take the keys and come to me.

733
00:56:47,040 --> 00:56:50,480
Very well. If you're afraid
of waiting in the police station,

734
00:56:50,560 --> 00:56:52,550
you can leave it directly you're inside.

735
00:56:52,640 --> 00:56:55,550
There's a secret way out
through the inspector's house.

736
00:56:55,640 --> 00:57:00,240
We'll disguise you as a policeman
and you can walk out and drive away.

737
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:02,880
Even if he sees you,
he won't recognise you.

738
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:05,760
He'll probably be waiting
to break in at ten o'clock.

739
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:10,470
- What happens to me then?
- I'll have you driven quietly back here.

740
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:14,680
Then get into your car and drive away
into the country, miles away,

741
00:57:14,760 --> 00:57:16,750
and stay there until we've got him.

742
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:20,280
Now, you needn't be afraid.
We'll get him all right this time.

743
00:57:20,360 --> 00:57:23,910
I'll lay traps that even
an invisible man can't pass.

744
00:57:25,520 --> 00:57:27,670
You see? It covers a fairly wide range.

745
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:31,040
Now, I've got 20 of these guns
and a good man to each.

746
00:57:31,120 --> 00:57:34,480
One splash of this on his skin
and we've got something to follow at last.

747
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,560
- Why not paint the top of the wall?
- Because he'd smell it.

748
00:57:38,640 --> 00:57:43,640
I've got a better plan. I'm going to put a
thin layer of loose earth on top of the wall.

749
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:47,000
The slightest touch will disturb it,
and we've got him trapped.

750
00:57:47,080 --> 00:57:49,440
Oh, I see. Pretty good.

751
00:58:01,440 --> 00:58:03,430
Quick march!

752
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,560
They think they're very clever.

753
00:58:28,240 --> 00:58:30,680
All right, take him straight inside.

754
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,070
20 minutes to ten.
Keep your eyes open now, boys.

755
00:58:41,160 --> 00:58:43,200
Here, quick, sir.

756
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,160
I heard footsteps outside,
soft footsteps, like naked feet.

757
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,230
Listen.

758
00:58:53,400 --> 00:58:55,390
Come on.

759
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:11,280
- Where are you going to?
- The mountains, 100 miles away.

760
00:59:11,360 --> 00:59:13,640
Drive away quickly.

761
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:29,150
It's ten minutes to ten.
He's bound to do something in a minute.

762
00:59:29,240 --> 00:59:34,560
- Will he try and get into the station?
- Every door and window is barred.

763
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:37,240
No, he'll try the wall right enough.

764
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:44,920
There he goes!

765
00:59:47,560 --> 00:59:51,160
- Go to your stations now. Watch the wall.
- He's over the wall!

766
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:54,440
I felt breathing down my neck.
He's in here.

767
00:59:56,160 --> 00:59:59,470
Ten o'clock!
Ten o'clock he wanted to murder me.

768
00:59:59,560 --> 01:00:03,440
I think this'll do nicely, Kemp.
We'll stop here.

769
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:07,200
It's ten o'clock.
I came with you to keep my promise.

770
01:00:07,280 --> 01:00:09,320
No! It's all a mistake, Griffin.

771
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:12,760
I swear I never told the police. I want
to help you. Let me be your partner.

772
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:17,280
I've had a cold and uncomfortable journey
just to keep my promise at ten o'clock.

773
01:00:17,360 --> 01:00:19,430
I went into the police station with you.

774
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:22,160
I stood by
while you changed into that coat.

775
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,120
I rode on the running board
of the car that took you home again.

776
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:48,790
There. You sit there.
I've got you where I want you.

777
01:00:51,000 --> 01:00:56,920
I hope your car's insured. I'm afraid
there's going to be a nasty accident.

778
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:59,070
A very nasty accident.

779
01:00:59,160 --> 01:01:02,840
- I'll do anything. Everything you ask me.
- You will? That's fine.

780
01:01:02,920 --> 01:01:07,840
Sit where you are. I'll get out and take the
handbrake off and give you a little shove.

781
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:10,200
You'll run down and through the railings.

782
01:01:10,280 --> 01:01:13,400
Then you'll have a big thrill for 100 yards
till you hit a boulder.

783
01:01:13,480 --> 01:01:16,040
Then you'll do a somersault
and break your arms,

784
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:18,270
then a grand finish-up
with a broken neck.

785
01:01:18,360 --> 01:01:21,590
Well, goodbye, Kemp. I always said
you were a dirty little coward.

786
01:01:21,680 --> 01:01:24,990
You're a dirty, sneaking
little rat as well. Goodbye.

788
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:44,960
1,000 replies have come to my appeal
for ways of catching the invisible man.

789
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:48,000
Some are clever, some stupid,
but all are impossible.

790
01:01:48,080 --> 01:01:51,200
He's got to sleep.
They might catch him asleep.

791
01:01:51,280 --> 01:01:54,880
- He's got to eat and drink.
- A caf was robbed last night in Manton.

792
01:01:54,960 --> 01:01:56,840
There's no proof he did it.

793
01:01:57,040 --> 01:01:59,840
There are robberies every night
by ordinary burglars.

795
01:02:17,840 --> 01:02:19,960
This feels good.

799
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:02,560
Look there. We wanted help - there it is.

800
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:08,390
It's now or never. The snow
won't lie long at this time of year.

801
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,280
It may be gone in a few hours.

802
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:13,120
Norton, find out if the snow
is yet all over the country.

803
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:15,080
Send out a broadcast message.

804
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:18,040
He can't stay out in this bitter cold.
He'll seek shelter.

805
01:03:22,280 --> 01:03:26,070
Excuse me, sir.
There's breathing in my barn.

806
01:03:27,480 --> 01:03:30,120
What do you mean,
breathing in your barn?

807
01:03:30,200 --> 01:03:34,200
The invisible man, sir.
Sure as I stand here.

808
01:03:34,280 --> 01:03:37,320
The farmer may have imagined it,
but we can't leave it to chance.

809
01:03:37,400 --> 01:03:40,390
Surround the barn.
No use trying to take him on the inside.

810
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:44,560
Force him out into the snow. Take
some wood and gasoline and set fire to it.

811
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:10,670
That's it, sir. He's in there
under a pile of straw, sir.

812
01:04:10,760 --> 01:04:12,880
Are there any windows
he can watch from?

813
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:15,030
No, sir. Only the door, sir.

815
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:22,430
There's a reward of 1,000
waiting for you if we're successful.

816
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,720
We're lucky to have the open country.

817
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:28,110
Take your men and cover the country
from the road to the hill.

818
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:30,560
Line the ridge through those trees.

819
01:04:35,400 --> 01:04:39,400
There's no time to lose. We can't wait
till he comes out to search for food.

820
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:43,240
We must fire the barn at once
and drive him out into the snow.

821
01:04:43,320 --> 01:04:47,470
Keep in single file. We don't want
a lot of your footprints around the barn.

822
01:04:47,560 --> 01:04:50,470
We want to keep the snow
for his feet alone.

823
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:09,480
Get that searchlight
on the door of that barn.

824
01:05:17,120 --> 01:05:19,270
He's out! Look!

825
01:05:20,520 --> 01:05:22,720
Shall I give the signal to advance?

827
01:06:03,000 --> 01:06:05,360
I don't think your guard
is needed any longer.

828
01:06:05,440 --> 01:06:07,830
- How is he?
- He's very near the end.

829
01:06:11,400 --> 01:06:14,710
- Are you Dr Cranley?
- Yes. I got word to come immediately.

830
01:06:14,800 --> 01:06:17,110
Towards dawn this morning
he grew quiet.

831
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,480
He called the name of a girl -
I understand, your daughter.

832
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,760
She's waiting below. Is there any chance?

833
01:06:23,840 --> 01:06:27,550
The bullet passed through both lungs.
It's impossible to treat the wound.

834
01:06:27,640 --> 01:06:30,240
Do you think your daughter
could bear to go to him?

835
01:06:30,320 --> 01:06:32,630
I'm afraid the end may be rather terrible.

836
01:06:32,720 --> 01:06:38,000
The effect of the drugs will die with him.
His body will become visible as life goes.

837
01:06:38,080 --> 01:06:39,990
I'll bring her now.

838
01:06:42,400 --> 01:06:45,000
- Is Flora there?
- She's coming now.

839
01:06:59,320 --> 01:07:01,600
I knew you would come to me, Flora.

840
01:07:03,240 --> 01:07:06,000
I wanted to come back to you.

841
01:07:06,080 --> 01:07:08,200
My darling.

842
01:07:08,280 --> 01:07:10,480
I failed.

843
01:07:10,560 --> 01:07:15,030
I meddled in things...
that man must leave alone.

845
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,990
Father, come quickly.
