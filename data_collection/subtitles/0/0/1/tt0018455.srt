{250}{450}Sunrise|A Song of Two Humans
{2469}{2643}This song of the Man and his Wife|is of no place and every place:
{2653}{2818}you might hear it anywhere at any time.
{2845}{2973}For wherever the sun rises|and sets in the city's turmoil or
{2983}{3143}under the open sky on the farm
{3153}{3364}life is much the same:|sometimes bitter, sometimes sweet
{3493}{3638}Summertime... vacation time
{6047}{6093}Among the vacationists was|a Woman of the City.
{6094}{6183}Several weeks had passed since her coming|and still she lingered.
{13203}{13413}"They used to be like children, carefree...|always happy and laughing..."
{14148}{14208}"They used to be like children, carefree...|always happy and laughing..."
{14264}{14473}"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city -|Money-lenders strip the farm - "
{14894}{15028}"Now he ruins himself for the woman from the city -|Money-lenders strip the farm -
{15028}{15100}and his wife sits alone."
{18871}{18948}"Tell me!|You are all mine?"
{19318}{19413}"Sell your farm...|come with me to the City."
{19618}{19668}"...and my wife?"
{19889}{19953}"Couldn't she get
{19960}{20063}"Couldn't she get drowned?
{20368}{20493}"...then overturn the boat...|it will look like an accident."
{21109}{21240}"Leave this behind...|come to the City!"
{21262}{21305}"COME TO THE CITY!"
{23784}{23913}"...after the boat has capsized,|save yourself with these bulrushes."
{23995}{24055}"The rushes will hold you up.
{24056}{24186}Scatter them before you reach the shore|and tell everyone she drowned by accident."
{34045}{34099}"We're going for a trip across the water.
{34100}{34191}I may not be back for quite a while."
{47018}{47093}"Don't be afraid of me!"
{51142}{51215}"Don't be afraid of me!"
{61076}{61243}"God is giving you,|in the holy blonds of matrimony, a trust.
{61243}{61313}She is young... and inexperienced.|Guide her and love her..."
{61363}{61469}"...keep and protect her from all harm."
{61978}{62038}"Wilt thou LOVE her?"
{63228}{63298}"Forgive me!"
{71332}{71373}"Manicure?"
{72210}{72290}"You'd look grand|with a high polish!"
{76526}{76576}"Come again!"
{76702}{76821}"Thank you!|And you must come and see us some time."
{78558}{78678}"Congratulations! She is the sweetest bride|I've seen this year."
{85100}{85130}"FARMERS!
{85131}{85200}If you want to sell your home|and move to the city--- We Pay Cash!"
{88112}{88194}"Hit the hole...|make the little piggy roll!"
{104646}{104715}"We'll sail home by moonlight...|another honeymoon."
{132373}{132410}"...I couldn't give up hope.
{132411}{132510}I know the tides...|I went around the Point..."
