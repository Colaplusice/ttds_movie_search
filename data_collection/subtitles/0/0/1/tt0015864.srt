{1648}{1727}In the great Gold Rush, Alaska|was the hope and dream of men,
{1742}{1780}the ruthless siren|of the Far North,
{1785}{1830}beckoning thousands|to her icy bosom.
{1835}{1887}Beckoning thousands|to her unknown regions.
{1892}{1964}Chilkoot Pass was the great barrier|to the gold fields.
{1969}{2030}Over this Pass men faced|untold misery and hardship.
{2035}{2100}Many lost their lives.|Some fell by the wayside,
{2105}{2146}others lost courage|and turned back.
{2151}{2188}But the brave went on.
{2286}{2355}Far into the icy north,|deep into the silent nowhere,
{2360}{2425}came an undaunted lone prospector.
{3575}{3669}And somewhere in that nowhere|was another lone prospector.
{3811}{3900}With cheerful optimism|our little Columbus descended,
{3905}{3976}then stopped, stepped,|slipped and slid.
{4351}{4410}"Now let me see,"|thought the little fellow.
{4415}{4463}"Before I know where I am,|I must get there."
{5481}{5542}There in that frozen wilderness|a dream came true,
{5548}{5607}and a lone voice shrieked|into the solemn sky,
{5612}{5712}"Eureka! I've found it,|a mountain of gold!"
{5857}{5940}But the elements laughed,|roared and thundered.
{6038}{6083}In that raging nowhere|was a lone cabin,
{6101}{6150}and another lone man,|Black Larson,
{6155}{6210}an unmitigated,|predatory scoundrel.
{7123}{7209}Out of the lashing storm|came the Little Fellow
{7214}{7296}to find shelter and perhaps|a little hospitality.
{7578}{7618}There he sat,|resting his weary bones
{7623}{7694}as the icy wind howled|through the knothole.
{8485}{8522}"Come here," said Larson.
{8537}{8571}"What are you doing?"
{8582}{8619}"Eating, obviously."
{8624}{8650}"Get out."
{8888}{8919}"Go on!"
{8970}{9002}"Get out!"
{9215}{9282}The wind also was giving|Big Jim his troubles.
{10414}{10472}Big Jim was the noble type.|He had suffered.
{10477}{10567}Oh, how he loved to suffer.|He suffered about everything.
{11150}{11193}"Get out," said Black Larson.
{11198}{11259}"Or I'll fill you both|full of lead."
{11439}{11490}"Now then,|the pair of you, get out!"
{11523}{11551}"Out!"
{11571}{11644}That kind of noise|Jim don't tolerate.
{12876}{12931}"I'll stay right here, understand?"
{12941}{12997}"Right here," said Big Jim.
{13011}{13095}"Yes, sir, he'll stay right here,"|said the Little Fellow.
{13290}{13355}"Understand? We stay right here."
{13494}{13519}And stay they did,
{13524}{13587}for days and nights.|The cabin moaned and groaned.
{13592}{13677}Two men walked and never talked,|hunger gnawed their bones.
{13866}{13936}"I must have food!" yelled Big Jim.
{13950}{13997}"I must have food!"
{14937}{14978}"What are you eating?"|Said Black Larson.
{15018}{15043}"Nothing."
{15048}{15076}"Open your mouth!"
{15351}{15395}"Liar! It's that candle."
{15419}{15491}"That?" said the Little Fellow.|"How revolting."
{15580}{15666}"If I thought you were holding out|on me, I'd slit your gizzard!"
{16379}{16474}"One of us must brave that storm,|if we're to get food."
{16526}{16570}"Come here, the pair of you."
{16606}{16676}"We'll cut the cards|and the low man goes."
{17081}{17129}"You're the man," said Jim.
{17302}{17338}"Goodbye, good luck."
{17343}{17400}"Don't forget|to bring home the bacon."
{18001}{18106}Somewhere in that nowhere,|the law was looking for Black Larson.
{19597}{19685}Desperate with hunger|and here it was Thanksgiving Day.
{19690}{19757}Nevertheless there was something|to be thankful for.
{20005}{20065}"Not quite done yet,|give it two more minutes."
{20070}{20109}"Come on, come on," said Big Jim.
{23948}{23995}After scouring the country for food,
{24000}{24057}the Little Fellow had to admit|he had seen nothing,
{24062}{24108}not even a field mouse.
{24334}{24374}From the pangs of hunger,
{24379}{24436}Big Jim was becoming delirious,|hysterical.
{24441}{24490}In fact he was a pain in the neck.
{24496}{24557}"Food, food!" he thundered.
{24609}{24650}"I can put another shoe in the pot."
{24655}{24712}"No, no, anything but that!"
{24783}{24842}Poor Jim, he couldn't take it.
{26080}{26121}"What's the matter?"|Said the Little Fellow.
{26126}{26175}"I thought you were a chicken."
{26396}{26455}"Well, build up the fire,"|said Big Jim.
{27011}{27073}"What's the matter with you?"|Said the Little Fellow.
{27082}{27135}"Come, my pretty bird,"|said Big Jim.
{27140}{27175}"Don't be childish."
{27466}{27520}"Hey, quit it.|Don't be foolish, it's me!"
{27580}{27626}"You!" said Jim.
{27657}{27697}"I'm sorry. I must be crazy."
{27702}{27764}"You're telling me,"|said the Little Fellow.
{27853}{27932}"You go inside. I'll take the gun|in case you lose it."
{28644}{28669}Chicken or no chicken,
{28674}{28739}the Little Fellow looks appetizing|to Big Jim.
{32725}{32820}Meanwhile Black Larson stumbled|onto Big Jim's mountain of gold.
{33145}{33193}Then came the parting of the ways,
{33198}{33275}Big Jim to his mine,|our hero to his fate.
{33280}{33312}"Goodbye," said the Little Fellow.
{33317}{33370}"It's been a great pleasure|knowing you."
{33755}{33834}Treachery awaited Big Jim|at his mountain of gold.
{34205}{34248}Big Jim looked deep into the eyes
{34253}{34296}of Black Larson
{34301}{34350}and saw there the soul of a skunk.
{34882}{34930}Caught in a maelstrom|of desperate deeds,
{34935}{35003}Black Larson swept on|to impending doom.
{35538}{35622}And out of a dream|in that frozen waste, a city grew.
{35627}{35703}And humanity warmed it with living,|loving and desiring.
{35841}{35870}Georgia.
{36212}{36255}Jack was a ladies' man.
{36290}{36321}Georgia was quick and impulsive,
{36326}{36366}proud and independent.
{36755}{36804}In the evening Georgia worked|as a dancehall girl.
{37337}{37385}Jack had lots of appeal for Georgia.
{37390}{37441}Perhaps that's why she resented him.
{38133}{38174}Out of the night|came the Little Fellow,
{38179}{38247}towards the dancehall,|that beacon light of pleasure,
{38253}{38303}that retreat of lost dreams.
{40949}{40997}"Georgia,|why aren't you nice to Jack?"
{41007}{41064}"I believe he really likes you,"|said the girl.
{41084}{41136}"He likes everybody,"|said Georgia quite audibly.
{41141}{41198}"I'm bored with this place,"|she continued.
{41203}{41291}"I'd give it all up if I could find|someone honest and worthwhile."
{41384}{41447}"Don't worry,|I'll find him someday."
{41485}{41521}Then she turned
{41526}{41592}and looked and looked
{41600}{41639}and looked.
{43883}{43927}"Kinda fresh, ain't ya?"|Thought Jack.
{43932}{43962}"Get down off that high horse."
{43967}{44008}"Me and you are gonna dance."
{44035}{44079}"Hey there, pan out a tune."
{44190}{44247}"Just a moment,|I said we're gonna dance."
{44252}{44295}"I beg your pardon," said Georgia.
{44300}{44336}To show her utter contempt for Jack,
{44341}{44424}she picked out the most deplorable|looking tramp in the dancehall.
{44438}{44474}"Hey you, come here."
{44549}{44608}"Yes, you. Do you want to dance?"
{44706}{44788}"You see, I'm very particular|about whom I dance with."
{48636}{48717}And there he stood,|the dauntless cavalier, guarding...
{48722}{48754}her sanctuary.
{49714}{49765}"If you wanna make a hit|with your lady friend,"
{49770}{49843}"you should put your hat|on straight, like this!"
{49879}{49924}"Take that you... Ouch!"
{50191}{50222}"Huh! Very good."
{50227}{50284}"Didn't know me own strength,"|said the Little Fellow.
{50920}{50997}Hank Curtis' cabin was|a stone's throw from the dancehall.
{51002}{51062}Hank was a mining engineer|who lived alone
{51068}{51099}and occasionally went|on long expeditions
{51104}{51128}into the Far North.
{51133}{51170}Hank was kind and human,
{51175}{51216}and our hero cold and hungry,
{51221}{51285}and the beans smelled good|and the coffee was steaming hot.
{51290}{51373}So the Little Fellow|devised a way of getting breakfast.
{53936}{54003}Big Jim recovered from the blow|he received from Black Larson
{54008}{54044}but lost his memory.
{54497}{54546}Hank's partner arrives.
{54551}{54606}Both are ready to leave|on a long expedition.
{54611}{54664}Hank informs his partner|that the Little Fellow
{54669}{54723}is to look after the cabin|while he's away.
{54824}{54896}"Goodbye," said Hank.|"And don't forget to feed the mule."
{55597}{55684}Since that night in the dancehall|the Little Fellow hadn't seen Georgia,
{55689}{55753}but an incident|was to bring them together again.
{57044}{57109}There she stood,|her loveliness lighting the room,
{57114}{57154}filling his soul|with the music of romance
{57159}{57198}for which he was so ill-fitted.
{57203}{57281}As she introduced her friends,|his heart began to sing.
{57630}{57724}As they warmed up by the stove,|he excused himself to get firewood.
{58631}{58689}And in that cabin|his secret was revealed,
{58694}{58730}his love for Georgia.
{58735}{58783}And the girls giggled and laughed,
{58788}{58832}perhaps in order to hide their pity.
{58837}{58895}For in the world of the dancehall|it wasn't wise for the girls
{58900}{58934}to reveal their hearts.
{58939}{59016}And so they thought|they'd have a little fun with him.
{59160}{59206}There in the gloaming they sat,
{59211}{59267}their faces alight with mischief,
{59276}{59339}but all the while|his heart was singing.
{59921}{59985}And so she fooled and flirted|and stroked his hair.
{59990}{60046}He knew she was fooling,|but he was happy.
{60051}{60111}For she was near him,|holding his hand,
{60116}{60151}smiling at him.
{60397}{60435}"Nice place you have here,"|said Georgia.
{60440}{60491}"I hope you will invite us again."
{60496}{60522}What if she were fooling?
{60527}{60582}He was enjoying|the warmth of her attention.
{60587}{60647}And the lady was enjoying|the warmth of his chair.
{61229}{61257}And now she was leaving.
{61262}{61309}The light of her loveliness|would be gone.
{61314}{61358}And he would be left|with an emptiness,
{61363}{61422}to return to his bleak,|lonely existence.
{61427}{61455}"Pardon me,"|said the Little Fellow,
{61460}{61531}"But, uh..."|He was lost for words.
{61587}{61628}"Would you really like|to come again?"
{61633}{61698}"Of course," said Georgia.|"What do you say, girls?"
{61705}{61762}"We'll come for dinner|New Year's Eve," said the ladies.
{61767}{61792}"Very well," said Georgia.
{61797}{61851}"We'll come to dinner|New Year's Eve."
{63301}{63378}Of course at that moment|Georgia would forget her gloves!
{63862}{63924}For the next few days the Little|Fellow hustled and shoveled
{63929}{63983}in order to buy|that New Year's dinner.
{66063}{66158}The eve of a new year.|New hopes and new dreams.
{69444}{69529}And there was Georgia, caressing him|with her smiles and tender glances.
{69534}{69590}And the girls called for a speech.
{69597}{69632}But he was too happy to speak.
{69637}{69710}All that mattered|was Georgia was there. Georgia!
{69715}{69773}So he muttered and stuttered|and finally said,
{69778}{69830}"I can't make a speech|but I'll do a dance."
{69835}{69893}And a dance he did, with the rolls.
{73083}{73202}Should auld acquaintance be forgot
{73207}{73320}And never brought to mind
{73354}{73486}Should auld acquaintance be forgot
{73491}{73630}And days of auld lang syne
{73641}{73790}For auld lang syne|My dear
{73795}{73864}For auld lang...
{75065}{75118}In the midst of all their revelry|the vague memory
{75123}{75177}of a promise crept|into Georgia's mind.
{75205}{75262}"Let's go up and visit|the Little Fellow," she said.
{76209}{76243}"We'll have some fun|with him," said Jack.
{76248}{76311}"We'll send Georgia in first,|then give him a scare."
{77665}{77690}"Oh, forget it," said Jack.
{77695}{77751}"How about giving me|a little attention?"
{78282}{78323}A day or so later|in the Recorder's office,
{78328}{78376}Big Jim tried to convince|the assayers
{78381}{78426}that he had a mountain of gold.
{78529}{78571}"Where is this place?" they said.
{78578}{78636}But Big Jim's memory|had failed him.
{78641}{78703}All he knew was|that it was near the cabin.
{78893}{78924}"The cabin, that's it!"
{78929}{79020}"F I could find my way to the cabin|I could find the mine."
{79033}{79073}"But I can't remember."
{79464}{79525}"Hey!" said Jack,|"Georgia's been looking for you."
{79530}{79556}The Little Fellow knew otherwise.
{79561}{79628}How dare that cad mention|her name so lightly?
{79633}{79679}For two pins|he'd give him another thrashing.
{79684}{79776}However being a little underweight|he would ignore the insult.
{80100}{80160}But it was true.|Georgia had been looking for him.
{80165}{80193}Georgia had written him a letter.
{80699}{80798}And as he went looking for Georgia,|so Big Jim went looking for him.
{80989}{81056}"You, you!" said Big Jim.
{81133}{81231}"You! The very man|I've been looking for!"
{81236}{81288}"The cabin, the cabin! Where is it?"
{81293}{81326}"Answer me, I say!"
{81331}{81394}"Can't you speak, man? Tell me!"
{81407}{81467}"Where's the cabin? Where is it?"
{81483}{81537}"At last I shall find|my mountain of gold."
{81542}{81581}"To your feet man, quick!"
{81586}{81619}"You're coming with me!"
{81624}{81712}"Take me to the cabin|and I'll make you a millionaire!"
{81790}{81861}"Georgia! Just a moment,"|said the Little Fellow.
{82036}{82097}"Georgia, you don't have to explain.|I understand."
{82102}{82149}"I love you.|I'll take you away from this life."
{82154}{82197}"I'm going away, and when I return,"
{82202}{82236}"I shall come back."
{82523}{82596}Exhausted and footweary,|they arrived at the cabin.
{82705}{82752}"Ah!" said Big Jim,|"it won't be long now."
{82757}{82843}"Bring in the eats and tomorrow|we'll start for the mine.
{82856}{82929}"Here, take a swig of this.|It'll put hair on your topcoat."
{83808}{83885}"My, this is a heavy lamb chop,"|said the Little fellow.
{85400}{85461}Then fate - it's always fate -|played its little joke,
{85466}{85533}and again the elements laughed,|roared and thundered,
{85538}{85608}but through it all|our heroes soundly slumbered.
{86100}{86145}Then came the dawn.
{86313}{86343}The Little Fellow awoke,
{86348}{86398}blissfully ignorant|of what happened the night before,
{86403}{86485}but feeling definitely conscious|of "the morning after".
{86889}{86963}"Oh well, may as well tidy up|and get breakfast."
{87557}{87633}"This is the worst liver attack|I've ever had."
{87953}{87986}"Feel that rocking?"
{87996}{88024}"It's the stomach."
{89265}{89299}"It's not the stomach."
{89636}{89681}"Let's go to the other side."
{89686}{89720}"We'll see how far it|will go over."
{90310}{90375}"Something|must be missing underneath."
{90430}{90481}"I'll go outside|and see what it is."
{91794}{91840}"Now," said Big Jim,|"don't get excited."
{91845}{91927}"Take it easy, don't move,|don't breathe!"
{92008}{92083}"I said don't breathe, stupid."
{92179}{92259}"You can be most annoying|at times."
{92327}{92385}"If you'll only be cool, be calm,"|said Big Jim,
{92390}{92431}"We have nothing to worry about."
{92780}{92841}"Now show a little character!|Where's your willpower?"
{92991}{93057}"Now listen,|I've got a very good idea."
{93063}{93110}"Hold your hands like this,|then I can get out first."
{93735}{93774}"You see what I mean?"|Said Big Jim.
{93779}{93841}"Your mind is chaotic.|You have no psychology."
{93846}{93888}"You have no control."
{94365}{94425}And Big Jim discovered his claim!
{95331}{95377}"Now we shall be rich," said Jim.
{95382}{95428}"We shall be millionaires!"
{95446}{95473}And so they were.
{96023}{96058}Now they were homeward bound
{96063}{96120}and they were leaving the hardship|and toil of Alaska
{96126}{96163}to live in the land|of milk and honey.
{96168}{96236}To live, laugh and indulge themselves|in the lap of luxury.
{96241}{96305}They were famous,|and sought after by the press.
{96478}{96506}In their cabin deluxe
{96511}{96563}they were welcomed|and waited upon.
{97023}{97078}The reporter wanted to write|the Little Fellow's life story,
{97083}{97141}"From Rags to Riches",|and he graciously consented.
{97470}{97505}And Big Jim was manicured.
{97510}{97570}"Not the nails," said he,|"the corns."
{97638}{97676}The reporter thought of a good idea,
{97681}{97734}to have the Little Fellow pose|in his mining clothes.
{97739}{97784}It would make a human story.
{98009}{98035}Georgia...
{98325}{98418}There she was in the steerage.|Neither knew of the other's presence.
{98423}{98499}Georgia overheard the officer say|there was a stowaway aboard.
{100704}{100737}"You!" said Georgia.
{100742}{100796}"I thought I'd never see you again."
{100801}{100844}And then she mistook him|for the stowaway.
{101239}{101283}The officer was going|to put him in irons.
{101288}{101361}But Georgia pleaded for him|and said she would pay his fare.
{101596}{101640}"Heck!" said the Captain.|"That's no stowaway."
{101645}{101709}"That's Big Jim's partner,|the multimillionaire."
{101757}{101813}Then of course there were apologies.
{101844}{101890}The Little Fellow|gathered himself together.
{101895}{101965}James, the valet, was told|to prepare for an extra guest.
{102198}{102268}"Pardon me," said the reporter,|"but who's the lady?"
{102284}{102320}"Buzz buzz buzz!"
{102325}{102381}"Oh, you don't say!|Well, congratulations."
{102387}{102457}"This will make a great story,|and with a happy ending."
{102499}{102526}And so it was.
{102532}{102567}A happy ending.
