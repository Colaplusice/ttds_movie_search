1
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:07,989
<i>l know how to breathe
and how not to breathe...</i>

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,909
<i>And how to think to stop myself
going mad or passing out.</i>

3
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,671
<i>He's been carrying on like this
for as long as l can remember.</i>

4
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:20,075
Would you like some more?

5
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:22,236
No, thank you.

6
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:28,276
Hold your fork properly, Erik!

7
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:46,393
Let's have a talk after dinner,
just the two of us.

8
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:55,875
EVlL

9
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,671
<i>Bullying...physical abuse...</i>

10
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:15,157
Do you understand what l'm saying?
What do you think will be the result?

11
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:20,871
Never, l repeat never, in all my years
as headmaster ot this school

12
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,231
have l met a more
vicious pupil than you

13
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:27,876
with such a brutish
level of behaviour.

14
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,719
Erik Ponti!

15
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,637
Now you listen to me!

16
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:47,429
The fact that some teachers happen
to defend your academic ability

17
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,476
does not make up for your behaviour.
ln fact, it makes it even worse.

18
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,353
lt's beyond understanding.

19
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:01,189
lt's deeply worrying.

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:07,032
There's only one word for people
like you, and that is ''evil''.

21
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:12,837
Evil in its purest form.
There's no other explanation.

22
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,508
What you need is a good trashing.

23
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,154
And more...

24
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,514
Be aware of one thing...

25
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:34,238
You'll never be admitted to any
state high school in this country.

26
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,793
Now go.

27
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:46,032
<i>There's only one word for
people like you and that's ''evil''.</i>

28
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,878
<i>Evil in its purest form.</i>

29
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:21,468
The best thing would be to set up
some kind of trust fund for Erik.

30
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,355
Has your husband approved this sale?

31
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,676
These things are mine.
This is what l have to do.

32
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,871
l was only asking.
He is the boy's stepfather...

33
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:35,279
As for your fee, we'll...
Let's deal with that after the sale.

34
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:39,318
Erik! Come in, Erik.

35
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,479
You've met mr Ekengren, our lawyer.
Yes, it was a few years ago.

36
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,752
l suppose you only came up to here
in those days.

37
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,637
lt was at your father's funeral.
We were old school friends of course.

38
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,876
Oh, excuse me...

39
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:58,277
Be careful! That's right.

40
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:03,711
Be careful with that door,
it's too low.

41
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:10,429
Erik, one thing,
l was wondering about these thefts...

42
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:15,998
They couldn't prove anything.
No, in which case you're not guilty.

43
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:19,272
At least from a purely legal angle.

44
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:22,392
ls there any other way
of being guilty?

45
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,038
No.  l'll prepare the paperwork
and then l will be in touch.

46
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:33,678
Take my card, Erik. You can always
phone me if anything comes up.

47
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,235
l'll find my own way out.

48
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,793
Erik, l know.

49
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:51,193
l know everything.

50
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:10,196
l suppose that you smoke.

51
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,277
There are so many things
l should have done for you.

52
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:32,031
l've spoken to your form mistress
and she believes you, she knows.

53
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:37,030
l had to explain to her how things
have been for you. She understood.

54
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:40,516
There's only one year left
until you go to the Sixth Form.

55
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,359
l've arranged for you to...

56
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:46,836
l didn't want to say anything
until it was all finalized.

57
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,238
You're going to go to a new school,
a boarding school.

58
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:56,798
There's a train in four hours. l had to
sell a few things, as you can see.

59
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:06,319
You have to promise me something.

60
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:09,671
This is your only opportunity
of reaching the Sixth Form.

61
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,839
You mustn't make a mess of it.
Promise me. Promise.

62
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:20,636
By the way, there are some
new clothes on your bed.

63
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:36,234
When's he coming home?

64
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,155
lt's for the best.
Here, run down and get your hair cut.

65
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,230
Erik Ponti.

66
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,197
Do you ride?
No.

67
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:22,312
All the better.
There's no stable here.

68
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,957
One has to go to the manor, a couple
of kilometres away. Otto Silverhielm.

69
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,637
l'm the head of the student council.
l introduce pupils to the premises.

70
00:09:31,840 --> 00:09:34,798
And so onwards to Cassiopeia.

71
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,839
ln the lower classes you live simply.
Next year you'll have better quarters.

72
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:52,635
And finally you'll stay in
splendid rooms in Olympia.

73
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:55,070
l'm only here for a year.
ls that so?

74
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,549
Right, so now we are heading
for Cassiopeia, which is down there.

75
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:05,398
You're in the room at the bottom.

76
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,398
No feet on the chairs!

77
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:20,877
You're with Pierre Tanguy. A good
man, good head on his shoulders.

78
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:26,279
His father is involved in big business.
ln Switzerland unless l'm mistaken.

79
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:31,110
Having said that,
Tanguy is hardly the athletic type.

80
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:34,949
Do you do any sports?
Yes, swimming. l swim.

81
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:38,391
Good. This way...

82
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,310
Let's go to work, boys.

83
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:01,833
Stjrnsberg has the best sports
facilities among the boarding schools.

84
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,429
A freshman?
A swimmer, he says.

85
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,159
Good day, sir.

86
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:09,716
ln my lessons we use
the second person...

87
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,717
Excuse me.

88
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,270
Berg is not so bad, but there are
rumours that he's a social democrat.

89
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:19,436
Let's start again!

90
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:30,392
This looks about as good as it gets.
That's what people say.

91
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,637
But l stay on dry land.

92
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:42,756
Be glad you're here. lf you've got
questions, you're welcome to ask.

93
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:48,114
Here at Stjrnsberg,
we believe in team spirit.

94
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,313
Hello.

95
00:12:00,280 --> 00:12:01,315
Erik.
Pierre.

96
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:06,710
Do you like Charlie Parker?
He's okay. l prefer Elvis.

97
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,389
lt seems good here. Good pool.
What's Berg like?

98
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:18,798
You're one of those sports fools?
Well, yeah, l suppose l am.

99
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,911
What about you?
Guess!

100
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,954
But l did like
Hamrin's goal against Germany.

101
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,435
Of course none of it
measures up to a good book.

102
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:30,598
l like reading as well.
Just so you know.

103
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,279
Why here? Too posh for a normal
school or is your father a diplomat?

104
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,677
Neither, really.

105
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:43,509
You're going to like him.
Berg, the sports master.

106
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:47,633
He's quite a good sort really,
to us incompetents.

107
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,753
What are the teachers like?
Good. They're the first team.

108
00:12:51,960 --> 00:12:56,158
They don't beat you then?
No, here the pupils keep the order.

109
00:12:56,360 --> 00:13:00,035
That's the point of team spirit.
Sounds good.

110
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,835
lt is what it is, always been...
Do you have good grades?

111
00:13:04,040 --> 00:13:07,828
Not exactly. Not in mathematics.
l could do with some private lessons.

112
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:12,875
l can do that for you. Half the price!
lf there's no results, your money back!

113
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,435
Yes, why not?
lt's in the family, you know.

114
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:19,519
That's how my old man got rich,
he profited from dodgy guarantees.

115
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,350
Silverhielm talked about Switzerland.
So he showed you round, did he?

116
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,872
That's right. Quite a decent sort.
Ha, some people think so.

117
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:32,390
What do you think?
l try not to think too much.

118
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:36,275
lt's better that way,
not thinking too much.

119
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,879
Do you like film?

120
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:41,277
No one is better than James Dean.
What's your favourite scene?

121
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:44,438
When they're in the observatory
looking at the stars

122
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:47,473
and then they fight with knives.
And yours?

123
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:52,629
At the end when his friend dies.
l cry every time l see it.

124
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:58,915
The headmaster and
all the teachers sit here.

125
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:03,916
Newcomers always sit
at the bottom end of the table.

126
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,475
And every table has a monitor
and a vicemonitor.

127
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,911
Yours is Silverhielm
and the other one is called Dahln.

128
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,557
Don't talk more than you have to,
and mind your table manners.

129
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:36,832
ln Jesus name we sit at the table
May God bless the food we are given

130
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,194
And with your benevolent hand
Bless our home and country

131
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:43,958
Amen

132
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,389
l hear you'll be in my class. Johan.
Erik.

133
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,596
You're from Stockholm as well?
Yes, Vasastan.

134
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,677
l'm from Kungsholmen.

135
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,916
Don't they seat us
in our class groups?

136
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:45,875
They also mix the lower forms with
the higher ones, the Sixth Formers.

137
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:49,277
That's the way it's always been.
Every school has its own traditions.

138
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:53,314
And here everyone is placed
according to the Peerage.

139
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,796
And those who aren't aristocrats?
According to how rich they are.

140
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,918
And the others?
They don't belong here.

141
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:05,069
lt's as easy as that. l suppose you
can think what you like about that.

142
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:09,068
His father's a social democrat.
What's your father, then?

143
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:14,831
None of your sodding business.
What did l hear?

144
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,235
What sort of language is that?

145
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:21,877
lt wasn't me.
Don't give me any lip. Come here!

146
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:41,437
You'd better count on the pepperpot.
A pepperpot? What's that?

147
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:47,033
What Karlberg had. lt's not as bad as
it looks. The vinegar strike is worse.

148
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:48,912
Let's go and smoke.
May we...?

149
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,558
Absolutely not. Are you coming?
l have to study but l'll see you later.

150
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:04,430
What if you refuse the pepperpot?
The dunce's corner!

151
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,155
What if you won't stand in
the dunce's corner?

152
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,955
Weekend detention.

153
00:17:15,680 --> 00:17:19,639
l see. At least then
you won't have to go home.

154
00:17:19,840 --> 00:17:23,515
The same for smoking. You say no to
weekend detention, you get expelled.

155
00:17:23,720 --> 00:17:29,397
l have no intention of getting expelled.
l'm going to improve my marks.

156
00:17:31,080 --> 00:17:34,277
Make sure you don't stick out!
What do you mean?

157
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:37,756
The best thing is to be ordinary.

158
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:46,676
Damn, we have to go. Don't forget
the pineneedles, so you don't smell.

159
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,872
Here!

160
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:05,230
Pierre, what happens
if you hit them back? Pierre!

161
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:20,359
So we see here the dispersion
of the Germanic peoples.

162
00:18:20,560 --> 00:18:23,996
The Germanic tribes were distinct
in many ways

163
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,352
from the Slavic tribes
originating in the east.

164
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:34,510
These differences can be seen
and traced even today.  Wgner...

165
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:39,316
Actually, we have a newcomer
here in the class.

166
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,351
Ponti!
Yes, sir.

167
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:47,237
Can you come and stand here
so everyone can see you clearly.

168
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,358
A good specimen.
So what do we see?

169
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:03,758
A steady gaze.
 Show us your profile.

170
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:09,876
Straight nose, a powerful chin,
a broad jawbone.

171
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:16,519
Observe the welldeveloped
musculature on the arms and legs.

172
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,914
All in all this is typical
of the Germanic type.

173
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:27,359
Many of Charles Xll's Carolinians
would have looked like this.

174
00:19:27,560 --> 00:19:29,471
The blues...

175
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,150
Well thank you, you can sit down.

176
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,476
And now let's take another example.

177
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:40,796
Tanguy!
Yes, sir.

178
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:44,276
Would you like
to come and stand here?

179
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:54,759
The most capable intellect
in this school.

180
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:59,431
But, but, but...what do we see here?

181
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:04,509
Eyes set deep in the head,
poor vision, a fleshy nose...

182
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:08,156
Sloping shoulders
like the outline of a bottle.

183
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:11,670
The waist like the base of a skittle.

184
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:16,317
ln addition, thin legs,
a tendency to flatfootedness.

185
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:21,594
All this is a splendid example
of the southern type.

186
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,278
<i>Allez!</i>

187
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:34,429
ln other words we can easily
distinguish clear differences.

188
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:41,671
The only question is, how do we act
on this insight, this knowledge?

189
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,393
Any suggestions?

190
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,674
Are there any others like Melander?
Nazis? No, he's the only one left.

191
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:54,477
Jews are being admitted now, but it
wasn't like that 10 or 20 years ago.

192
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:59,708
Strange that they let him carry on
like that. lt's just a lot of bloody crap.

193
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:03,629
l just thought l heard something.
Excuse me, maybe l swore.

194
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:05,672
Over here!

195
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:09,239
We were discussing something.
l said come here.

196
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:15,033
Are you refusing?
Yes, l'm refusing.

197
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,391
You'll have to stay in
the dunce's corner.

198
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:21,831
l'm afraid l'm going to refuse
that as well.

199
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:27,792
You know what that means.
Yes, weekend detention.

200
00:21:33,160 --> 00:21:37,756
And you, you should know better.
Come here!

201
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,838
May l help you?

202
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:42,714
Can l swim a couple of lengths?

203
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,956
Can you swim a couple of lengths?

204
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,912
You're new here, aren't you?
Yes.

205
00:22:48,120 --> 00:22:51,237
This pool is reserved in the evenings.
Reserved for who?

206
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:57,549
Sixth formers, members of the council,
the school team. You'd better leave.

207
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,757
What does it take
to get into the school team, then?

208
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,190
What's the school record
50 metres freestyle?

209
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,470
29,6.

210
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:09,956
l can do 50 metres in 29 seconds.

211
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,110
Okay...

212
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:29,632
You were out by 1/1 0.

213
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,519
Welcome to the school team.
My name is Karl von Rosen.

214
00:23:40,440 --> 00:23:43,034
l can't congratulate you.
Are you jealous?

215
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,596
Not the least.
The less you stick out the better.

216
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:50,588
So what do you think l should do?
Swim more slowly?

217
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:56,670
How do you keep a low profile?
l'm a bookworm, a bit of a coward.

218
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:59,474
lt's not fun punching
a cowardly intellectual.

219
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:03,434
lt's going to be much worse for you.
But you don't understand that yet.

220
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:05,232
Come in.

221
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:10,388
Erik Ponti? Go to the Olympia House.
Why?

222
00:24:10,600 --> 00:24:14,229
lt's an order from Dahln.
lsn't that what l said.

223
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:23,834
Just see me as the winner today.

224
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,629
Well here we are...
Our little swimming boy

225
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:36,709
who's a bit of a bigmouth
or maybe just a little dense up top.

226
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,751
No, l'm not.
Good.

227
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:43,636
So l won't have to explain
how to polish shoes then?

228
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,231
Back in a minute.
So you get started on these.

229
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:56,751
All these pairs have to pass
inspection. You better get started.

230
00:24:56,960 --> 00:24:58,916
Not on your life!

231
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:04,838
What are we going to do with him?
Calm down. He's new.

232
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:17,389
Listen, why didn't you just do it?
You have to do as they say.

233
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:22,958
l should have polished their shoes but
couldn't. At least l didn't fight them.

234
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:26,197
What if you hit a council member?
Expelled straight away!

235
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,359
l don't want any trouble. That's why
l came here in the first place.

236
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:34,638
Can't you just lie low for a while?
What if you can't?

237
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:39,436
Wait! Have you read Gandhi?
What do you mean, Gandhi?

238
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,837
He created peace in lndia
without any violence.

239
00:25:43,040 --> 00:25:46,396
Good, so we'll just tell everyone
that we refuse to be bullied?

240
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:50,559
You have already refused to do
two things. You'll be punished.

241
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:56,710
They can give me weekend detentions.
l still won't polish their shoes!

242
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:12,436
Do you think it's possible
to resist them nonviolently?

243
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:16,394
That's what l want to think.
l'd like to think so as well.

244
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:20,752
Shall we say good night then?
Yeah, let's... Good night.

245
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:36,438
Erik, are you asleep?
Almost.

246
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:41,676
l just wanted to say,
you're my friend.

247
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:46,435
You're my friend too, Pierre.

248
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,996
You're the only friend
l've ever had in this school.

249
00:27:01,640 --> 00:27:06,634
Round and round
until it actually passes out.

250
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:11,834
Possibly this behaviour
explained by the intoxication of love.

251
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:18,229
The scent is strong and disengages
the normal selfprotective instincts.

252
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,670
A capercaille that's displaying

253
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:24,270
that is a Tetrao Urogallus, can get
into such a pitch of excitement

254
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,029
that it starts attacking
cattle or even people.

255
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:32,995
lts sexual instincts, so to speak,
make it lose its common sense.

256
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:39,275
You can read about all this in Schultz,
chapters 5  8.

257
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:43,234
That'll be all. Thanks, my friends.
Thank you, sir.

258
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:55,112
He's good, Transtrmer.
The Crane is the best teacher.

259
00:27:55,320 --> 00:28:00,758
He was going to be a professor in
Lund, but someone else got the job.

260
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,313
Look out!

261
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,756
Apologise!
For what?

262
00:28:05,960 --> 00:28:09,270
For behaving like an oaf.
Apologise...

263
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:14,633
Just apologise and we'll forget it.

264
00:28:16,280 --> 00:28:19,477
Like hell l will.
You stuckup little shit.

265
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,871
Apologise.
Never!

266
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:29,675
Right. Consider yourself challenged,
in the ring, 7 o'clock.

267
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,310
What bloody ring?

268
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:43,998
They're always two against one.

269
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,590
You have to take a lot!
Otherwise you're a coward.

270
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,997
When they knock you down
you must crawl out of the ring.

271
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:56,957
But you're allowed to hit them back?
Yes, but you don't stand a chance.

272
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,630
You don't have to.

273
00:29:00,840 --> 00:29:04,435
But then you'll be called a rat
for the rest of the term.

274
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:09,794
Everyone wants to see blood.
That's the sad thing. They want blood.

275
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:12,952
FlGHT, FlGHT, FlGHT!

276
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,994
l don't understand this.
Let's see...

277
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,954
This is the same thing.

278
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:46,632
l don't want to be disturbed.
But l...

279
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:52,516
Beg for mercy!
What did you say?

280
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,472
l'm begging for mercy!
What did you say?

281
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:56,193
Mercy!

282
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:59,313
Go on, on your hands and knees!

283
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,750
CRAWL, CRAWL, CRAWL!

284
00:30:32,040 --> 00:30:36,238
<i>Hello! Erik! ls it really you?
ls he at home?</i>

285
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:39,796
No, father is in the restaurant.
They are so busy at the moment.

286
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,879
<i>He's not my father.
How are things with you?</i>

287
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:47,595
<i>l've been thinking about you.
l won't be home for a while.</i>

288
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,872
<i>Has anything happened?
No, l just have to study.</i>

289
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:53,874
l understand.
No one is giving you trouble, l hope?

290
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,719
l've made a good friend.
Pierre, he's called.

291
00:30:56,920 --> 00:31:00,595
That's nice.
l knew things would go well.

292
00:31:01,280 --> 00:31:04,477
<i>Didn't l say so?</i>

293
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:07,638
Next man! Erik Ponti!

294
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:25,393
lt appears that Rat doesn't have
the guts to be here.

295
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,354
RAT, RAT, RAT!

296
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,239
Let's go and smoke.

297
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,279
No...
Well done!

298
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:56,673
lt's forbidden to socialize
with the kitchen staff.

299
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,156
Do you get expelled for that as well?
Yes, definitely.

300
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:05,832
Have you ever done it? You know...
Yes, many times.

301
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:11,353
No, l haven't. And you? Rats tend
to multiply very quickly, don't they?

302
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:16,998
So what's your conclusion?
lf x=18, then y=3.

303
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:19,714
Well done!

304
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:22,517
Room search!

305
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,553
Get out!
Out!

306
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:17,515
Well done, Markus! But you need to
kick harder as you approach goal.

307
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:20,553
Okay.
Thanks for today, boys.

308
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:35,349
You really feel at home in the water,
don't you?

309
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,393
Just before Christmas
we have the championship.

310
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,592
Why is it called
''The Lewenheusen Cup''?

311
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:44,633
His father endowed the prize

312
00:33:44,840 --> 00:33:48,594
and obviously his son
is supposed to win it this year.

313
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:53,112
But...l think you have a good chance
of pipping him at the post.

314
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,390
l don't know.

315
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:59,354
Erik, do you know the worst thing
for a sports master?

316
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:03,394
lt's when you see talent go to waste,
promise that never comes to fruition.

317
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:07,275
Never get like that, even if winning
would create enemies for you.

318
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:12,679
l already have enemies.
So show them! ln an honest battle.

319
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:16,475
Show them that your name
doesn't have to be Lewenheusen

320
00:34:16,680 --> 00:34:19,194
to lift the swimming cup.

321
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:23,269
Think how good it would be for the
Lower School to have its champion.

322
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:25,596
You think so?
Of course l do!

323
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:28,758
lt's never happened before.

324
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:33,033
Sport is democratic, Erik.
Think about that.

325
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:42,838
l want you to write freely,
straight from the heart

326
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:48,472
something personal about
an animal of your own free choice.

327
00:34:49,240 --> 00:34:52,198
Well, on you go!

328
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:02,272
That felt good.

329
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:08,157
His friend Egon, was so big and tall,
as bad at mathematics as you are.

330
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:24,597
Listen here, please! The council
is meeting tonight at 20.00.

331
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:28,952
The following are required to
be present:

332
00:35:29,160 --> 00:35:30,673
Bergvall.

333
00:35:34,040 --> 00:35:35,996
Lagerros.

334
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:40,436
Leffler.

335
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,996
And...Rat.

336
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,032
Hello!

337
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:02,593
What did you get?
Three weekend detentions.

338
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,552
Bloody hell...

339
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:10,352
Rat, it's your turn.

340
00:36:24,200 --> 00:36:27,033
Please read out the accusation.

341
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:29,913
The accused has refused
to comply with orders.

342
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:36,355
On the third of Septembre at 21.15 
refused to polish a number of shoes...

343
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:38,437
ls this statement correct?
Yes.

344
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:42,792
Stand up straight!
Does it affect this hearing?

345
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:50,314
Your punishment for mouthing off is
a SaturdaySunday of punitive labour.

346
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:53,592
Would the Secretary
make a note of that?

347
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:57,031
Do you have anything to add
in your defence?

348
00:36:57,240 --> 00:37:00,277
Lower School pupils have to
follow orders from Sixth Formers.

349
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:04,917
Dahln piled up a load of muddy shoes.
He was trying to humiliate me.

350
00:37:05,120 --> 00:37:09,398
l don't think we need to
deliberate further on this.

351
00:37:09,600 --> 00:37:14,515
lt's a simple case of insubordination
and you've been cheeky here.

352
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:19,555
Two further weekend detentions, we
warn you to shape up in the future.

353
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:20,670
Do you understand?

354
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:26,273
l'll obey orders from council members,
but l won't polish any bloody shoes!

355
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:29,472
Bad language again!

356
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:32,956
Another weekend detention!
Plus we demand an apology.

357
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:34,553
l've been given my punishment.

358
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:38,116
Four weekend detentions
and two under house arrest!

359
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:42,313
Will you now apologise?
No.

360
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:51,599
Two weekends with forced labour,
eight weekends under house arrest

361
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:56,999
for verbal insubordination and
disrespectful behaviour. You may go.

362
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:15,153
Lagerros: raking of paths.
Leffler: Cleaning in corridors.

363
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:18,875
Bergvall: Painting of flagpoles.

364
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,798
You may go.

365
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,070
Rat, come with me.

366
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:35,791
We need a trench, one metre long,
one metre wide and one metre deep.

367
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:39,798
Understood?

368
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,951
So go to work!

369
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:05,314
They say that American swimmers
have started working out...

370
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:09,798
...with weights, rings and all sorts.
You only go stiff.

371
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,753
Yeah, but it gets better, they say.

372
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:16,430
You build up more speed
than you ever had before.

373
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:20,997
So this is a good way of training?
According to the yanks, anyway.

374
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:26,433
We have to hope they're right. Go on,
speed up a bit, it's going to rain.

375
00:39:36,680 --> 00:39:39,797
Well done! Good work!

376
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:43,709
Do you know what you'll do now?
No, what?

377
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:49,153
You have to fill it in again,
before someone falls into it...

378
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:56,192
Did you hear what l said, Rat?
Yes.

379
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,868
Good. Get to work!

380
00:40:56,120 --> 00:41:01,353
Have they forced you to work?
Because you don't want to fight?

381
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:04,552
That's not right.
lt's known as team spirit.

382
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:10,992
l've got a brother at home.
He reminds me a little of you.

383
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:15,352
Doesn't say much but gets steamed
up if anyone does anything unfair.

384
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:17,710
Mikko's his name.

385
00:41:21,120 --> 00:41:25,398
Where are you from? Helsingfors?
No, Savolaks.

386
00:41:25,600 --> 00:41:31,277
Back home those fine and mighty
council members would get lynched.

387
00:41:31,480 --> 00:41:35,234
They wouldn't be allowed to carry on
like the Whites during the war.

388
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:39,433
Do you ever miss home?
l miss my family, of course.

389
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:44,589
But there aren't any jobs back home.
l like it here. lt's fine.

390
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:49,396
But l only make 125 crowns a week
and l'm not allowed to join the union.

391
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:52,433
What's your name?
Marja.

392
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:55,837
Erik.
l know.

393
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:09,711
l found it. Savolaks.

394
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,993
lt says here it's got some of
the finest nature in Finland.

395
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,990
Something else. l've realized
what l want to be  a writer.

396
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:22,670
But my dad would never
let me do that. What about you?

397
00:42:22,880 --> 00:42:28,034
Finnish.
Sounds okay, but it's hardly a job.

398
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:32,472
A lawyer, then?
Why not? A Finnish lawyer.

399
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:39,396
Have a nice weekend, Rat.

400
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:02,957
Oscar Wilde. He's a puff, isn't he?
Wilde. He's dead.

401
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,078
Have the Swedish masters approved?
What? That he's dead or a puff?

402
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:18,674
Bloody watch yourself!

403
00:43:42,640 --> 00:43:44,517
Don't you ever have any free time?

404
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:48,599
Apparently not,
but it doesn't bother me too much.

405
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:54,079
Don't you miss your parents?
Not very much.

406
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:59,912
At home it's winter, here it's warm
enough to take an evening walk.

407
00:44:00,120 --> 00:44:01,917
Yes.

408
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:06,272
l was going to take a stroll later.
At about 7 o'clock.

409
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:08,476
Yes.

410
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:12,872
Where you boys stand around
having a smoke.

411
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,597
Like l said, about 7.

412
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:42,037
Hello.
Hello!

413
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:47,075
How did you know we come here?
You know what you know.

414
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,909
You shouldn't smoke.
That's what my coach says.

415
00:44:51,120 --> 00:44:55,511
That's not what l was thinking about.
l was thinking about your breath.

416
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:59,599
We take these pine needles
and chew them.

417
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:01,950
lt makes everything disappear!

418
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:04,754
Everything?
Yes, everything.

419
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:09,669
Even me?
No, you're here.

420
00:45:14,280 --> 00:45:18,717
But who wants to kiss an anthill?

421
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,078
Let's concentrate!

422
00:45:45,280 --> 00:45:47,191
Did you do this?
Stop this!

423
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:51,109
Come on, boys!
Take the ball, Pierre.

424
00:45:51,320 --> 00:45:53,595
Take up your position.
Where shall l go?

425
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:56,394
You're the goalkeeper.
Okay.

426
00:46:01,480 --> 00:46:04,153
Nice try, Pierre!

427
00:46:07,480 --> 00:46:11,155
And then there's the Cloister Night.
What's that?

428
00:46:11,360 --> 00:46:15,114
A fine old tradition. Most people
get away with a cold shower.

429
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:20,348
But they hoisted one kid up the flag
pole. He was hanging there for hours.

430
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,111
Watch out. They focus their efforts
against freshmen who stand up.

431
00:46:29,800 --> 00:46:33,031
What time will they be here?
About midnight.

432
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:38,189
lf they really wanted the element
of surprise they'd come at three.

433
00:46:44,560 --> 00:46:46,596
What are you going to do with that?
Defend myself.

434
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,271
Are you mad? lt's the whole council.
Twelve men. You'll be expelled.

435
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:56,235
Maybe you shouldn't stay here.
Jakobson is away, sleep in his bed.

436
00:46:56,440 --> 00:46:59,557
No, we're not going to do it like that.
l'm staying.

437
00:47:09,560 --> 00:47:12,757
Are you sleeping?
Are you mad?

438
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,631
What are you most afraid of?

439
00:47:16,840 --> 00:47:18,592
Being expelled.
My future goes up in smoke.

440
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:20,756
l mean what they might do to you.

441
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,714
My face. lf they take a club and
knock my teeth out or break my nose.

442
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:27,593
What about you?
Forget that l asked.

443
00:47:29,240 --> 00:47:32,869
<i>This is how we'll do it.
You open the door. Keep a watch!</i>

444
00:47:40,440 --> 00:47:42,032
Don't stand so close!

445
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:44,675
<i>One, two, three...</i>

446
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,392
Best wishes from Olympia!

447
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:58,678
Oh, Jesus!

448
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:10,912
Are you sure about this?

449
00:48:11,120 --> 00:48:14,635
What's the time?
lt has to be 2 o'clock.

450
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:18,753
l'll be back in ten minutes.

451
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:09,513
How did it go? What did they say?
They had no proof.

452
00:50:09,720 --> 00:50:11,631
l said it could be anyone, even you.

453
00:50:11,840 --> 00:50:15,515
Thanks! But Silverhielm
will never let this rest.

454
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,234
Better to get it over and done with
straight away.

455
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:22,513
ln Jesus name we sit at the table
May God bless the food we are given

456
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:27,271
And with your benevolent hand
Bless our home and country

457
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,198
Amen

458
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,834
Strange. Can anyone smell shit?
Shit, l smell shit.

459
00:50:47,040 --> 00:50:49,713
ls there someone here
who hasn't washed properly?

460
00:50:49,920 --> 00:50:54,357
l wonder if Sixth Form shit
tastes better than First Form shit?

461
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,073
What do you think, ''Shittyhielm?''

462
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:58,077
You?!

463
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:03,559
l heard that you tried it. Maybe it
was your own shit you were eating.

464
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:08,595
You're stinking ''Shittyhielm''!
Even your hands are stinking.

465
00:51:11,880 --> 00:51:13,438
''Shittyhielm!''

466
00:51:38,600 --> 00:51:40,591
Stop that!

467
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,270
l think that'll do, boys.

468
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:48,278
Who are you? Really?

469
00:52:49,440 --> 00:52:53,513
l'll deal with that question later.
l have to sleep.

470
00:53:52,521 --> 00:53:54,432
No talking in the ranks, Karlberg!

471
00:53:54,641 --> 00:53:58,793
Let's maintain proper behaviour
in the ranks, boys.

472
00:54:12,081 --> 00:54:16,632
You're not allowed here.
But l want to see you.

473
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:37,800
Can l ask you something?
Yes.

474
00:54:38,001 --> 00:54:42,597
Will you come and watch tomorrow?
Do you want me to?

475
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:49,717
Will you win?
lf you come l'll win.

476
00:54:49,921 --> 00:54:53,470
Do you have the guts?
Do you dare win?

477
00:55:11,721 --> 00:55:15,475
The winner of the 200 metre
freestyle is Erik Ponti from class 3:5.

478
00:55:26,041 --> 00:55:29,556
So now there's only
the 300 metre freestyle left.

479
00:55:29,761 --> 00:55:33,151
lt's between you and Lewenheusen.
What are you doing to do?

480
00:55:33,361 --> 00:55:36,034
What do you mean?
Are you going for it?

481
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:40,678
Should l let Lewenheusen win? More
sportsmanlike not to enter the race!

482
00:55:40,881 --> 00:55:45,193
This is not about being sportsmanlike.
Haven't you understood that?

483
00:55:45,401 --> 00:55:47,869
This is Stjrnsberg.
Hey, boys!

484
00:55:48,081 --> 00:55:53,678
Just thought l'd check that
no one falls before the last hurdle.

485
00:56:02,321 --> 00:56:05,757
We've got them! Be careful
not to get disqualified at the start.

486
00:56:05,961 --> 00:56:11,911
Everything has already been decided.
For that very reason. Show them!

487
00:56:12,201 --> 00:56:16,752
What'll happen if l win?
You'll be untouchable.

488
00:56:18,321 --> 00:56:21,916
l promise.
lt's a matter of honour for me.

489
00:56:27,041 --> 00:56:28,997
Get set. Go.

490
00:57:14,921 --> 00:57:22,919
The overall champion and holder of
three new school records, Erik Ponti!

491
00:58:03,921 --> 00:58:05,593
Hello there...

492
00:58:07,441 --> 00:58:11,719
l'm decorating the tree.
l can see that.

493
00:58:11,921 --> 00:58:14,754
l can see that
you're decorating the tree.

494
00:58:22,681 --> 00:58:24,433
Erik...

495
00:58:26,601 --> 00:58:32,710
My darling, welcome home.
l've missed you so much!

496
00:58:32,921 --> 00:58:35,515
How is my little boy?

497
00:58:35,681 --> 00:58:39,515
You look so grown up.
 Doesn't he?

498
00:58:39,721 --> 00:58:43,999
But what the hell is he wearing?
You look like a tram driver.

499
00:58:44,201 --> 00:58:45,475
Doesn't he?

500
00:58:45,681 --> 00:58:48,878
You look lovely, really lovely.

501
00:58:50,281 --> 00:58:52,431
Look.

502
00:58:52,641 --> 00:58:55,553
But what happened to you there?
Nothing. Here.

503
00:58:55,761 --> 00:58:58,514
lt's wonderful.

504
00:58:58,721 --> 00:59:01,554
We'll keep it here.

505
00:59:02,761 --> 00:59:05,912
Are you hungry?
We'll be eating in a minute.

506
00:59:06,121 --> 00:59:09,113
Father has taken food back
from the restaurant. Venison.

507
00:59:18,201 --> 00:59:21,557
This is very good.

508
00:59:21,761 --> 00:59:25,595
How many straight A's have you got?

509
00:59:31,121 --> 00:59:36,912
But what the hell is all this?
C for Behaviour?

510
00:59:37,641 --> 00:59:41,953
How does our ''Stjrnsbergian''
explain that?

511
00:59:42,561 --> 00:59:47,874
Has it got something to do
with all the weekend detentions?

512
00:59:48,081 --> 00:59:51,994
Just think, you won the school
championships in swimming.

513
00:59:52,201 --> 00:59:56,353
But my dear, that's not what
we're bloody talking about, is it?

514
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:58,597
Do you have an explanation?

515
00:59:58,801 --> 01:00:01,190
l didn't want to be some errand boy
for the Sixth Formers.

516
01:00:01,401 --> 01:00:04,996
Oh, l see.
What did you want to be then?

517
01:00:05,201 --> 01:00:07,112
Left in peace.
What?

518
01:00:07,321 --> 01:00:09,357
Left in peace.

519
01:00:12,161 --> 01:00:17,076
ln peace... So you thought your
mother should sell off her heirlooms

520
01:00:17,281 --> 01:00:19,670
so you could be left in peace.

521
01:00:19,881 --> 01:00:22,395
ls that it?
No.

522
01:00:22,601 --> 01:00:27,675
That's not what you meant. What
then? l'm not understanding anything.

523
01:00:30,401 --> 01:00:33,074
How many do you want, Erik?

524
01:00:38,161 --> 01:00:40,914
Thank you.
Look how wonderful it looks.

525
01:00:41,121 --> 01:00:43,635
Pommes duchesse, marvellous.

526
01:00:43,841 --> 01:00:47,516
Erik, you know whenever
there's something l don't understand

527
01:00:47,721 --> 01:00:51,270
we have to have a talk after dinner.

528
01:00:51,521 --> 01:00:54,399
That's what we'll do.

529
01:00:54,601 --> 01:00:57,513
But...have some, darling, start.

530
01:00:58,681 --> 01:01:01,354
Haricots verts...how delicious!

531
01:01:23,281 --> 01:01:25,351
There we are...

532
01:01:29,321 --> 01:01:32,916
We're friends again.
Friends again...

533
01:02:15,121 --> 01:02:17,316
Marja!

534
01:02:52,641 --> 01:02:54,438
Marja!

535
01:03:13,841 --> 01:03:18,198
Hello, Pierre.
Thanks for the record. Sounds good!

536
01:03:18,401 --> 01:03:21,154
What's this?
Open.

537
01:03:34,401 --> 01:03:37,757
lf you're going to be a lawyer
you'll need one of these.

538
01:03:37,961 --> 01:03:41,317
Not that it applies in this school,
but nonetheless.

539
01:03:43,361 --> 01:03:45,113
SWEDlSH LAW

540
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:47,676
lt's quite strange
when you think about it.

541
01:03:47,881 --> 01:03:53,638
School rules shouldn't be above
the law of the land, should they?!

542
01:03:58,041 --> 01:04:00,157
No, thanks.

543
01:04:10,241 --> 01:04:12,197
You there!

544
01:04:12,401 --> 01:04:14,312
What?

545
01:04:14,521 --> 01:04:18,639
l haven't done anything.
Don't give me any lip. Come here.

546
01:04:21,041 --> 01:04:24,875
No, l won't.
You'll have to stand in the corner.

547
01:04:25,081 --> 01:04:28,869
Why? l haven't done anything.
Come to the council at 1 9.00.

548
01:04:29,081 --> 01:04:31,879
Understood?

549
01:04:45,001 --> 01:04:48,835
How did it go?
What did they say?

550
01:04:49,041 --> 01:04:51,760
Three weekend detentions.
Why?

551
01:04:51,961 --> 01:04:55,078
l gave them lip, refused the
pepperpot. The next time: the ring!

552
01:04:55,281 --> 01:04:58,512
''No fun thumping a coward
and an intellectual.''

553
01:04:58,721 --> 01:05:00,951
Room search!

554
01:05:04,881 --> 01:05:06,917
Stand up straight, Tanguy!

555
01:05:07,121 --> 01:05:11,273
What the hell are you doing?
Stand up straight, Tanguy!

556
01:05:15,521 --> 01:05:17,876
Stand up straight, Tanguy!

557
01:05:19,121 --> 01:05:21,077
Look at me!

558
01:05:21,281 --> 01:05:22,680
Good.

559
01:05:31,801 --> 01:05:36,670
lt looks like we have
a bedwetter here.

560
01:05:40,521 --> 01:05:43,160
Be ready in an hour, Tanguy!

561
01:05:49,481 --> 01:05:51,756
Don't you understand
what this is about?

562
01:05:51,961 --> 01:05:56,193
They're trying to get at you.
They've just changed their tactics.

563
01:05:56,441 --> 01:05:58,750
Good day, sir!

564
01:06:01,401 --> 01:06:03,471
Good day, sir!
Erik!

565
01:06:06,001 --> 01:06:10,916
l've got an idea about the training.
l'm not going to swim any more.

566
01:06:11,441 --> 01:06:14,433
What? You can't do that.
Yes l can.

567
01:06:14,641 --> 01:06:18,793
But...you're the best swimmer
we've ever had.

568
01:06:19,001 --> 01:06:22,676
You said l'd be untouchable. That it
was a matter of honour for you.

569
01:06:22,881 --> 01:06:25,236
But there's no honour here.
You know that.

570
01:06:25,441 --> 01:06:29,878
There are many different ways
of making life hell for people.

571
01:06:47,081 --> 01:06:49,914
Hello!
You're not allowed to be here.

572
01:06:50,121 --> 01:06:54,239
Don't you want to talk to me?
Of course l do, but it's too risky.

573
01:06:54,681 --> 01:06:57,434
l don't give a damn about them.
l'm thinking about myself as well.

574
01:06:57,641 --> 01:07:02,112
l don't want to lose my job
and you could be expelled.

575
01:07:02,321 --> 01:07:04,437
Wait.

576
01:07:06,961 --> 01:07:12,877
l'm sorry, Erik.
lt's not possible. Not now.

577
01:07:24,121 --> 01:07:27,796
Rat! Come up for an inspection.

578
01:07:35,481 --> 01:07:38,154
Rat! ln here.

579
01:07:39,081 --> 01:07:43,597
Good that you could come, Rat.
We need an independent witness.

580
01:07:43,801 --> 01:07:47,077
Fatty here is just about to admit
he's been smoking on the sly.

581
01:07:47,281 --> 01:07:52,355
No! lf you hit him, you'll be expelled.
That's quite right. Paragraph 13.

582
01:07:52,561 --> 01:07:58,272
Smoking indoors is also enough
for immediate expulsion. Paragraph 7.

583
01:08:02,161 --> 01:08:06,040
Who's going to prove that?
A rat and a pig?

584
01:08:06,241 --> 01:08:09,074
Shit, Dahln,
it's like a bloody zoo in here!

585
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:15,633
Now about that confession.

586
01:08:18,121 --> 01:08:21,318
lt's about time you stubbed out
your cigarette for good.

587
01:08:24,161 --> 01:08:27,153
Here. Stub it out, you coward!

588
01:08:28,881 --> 01:08:30,553
What?

589
01:08:35,761 --> 01:08:39,037
Let's see if it hurts
as much as you think.

590
01:08:39,241 --> 01:08:41,516
With your permission,
in front of witnesses.

591
01:08:41,721 --> 01:08:44,394
With any bloody permission you like.

592
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,957
You haven't got the guts, have you?

593
01:09:28,081 --> 01:09:32,597
Get dressed, Tanguy! Present yourself
in the ring tomorrow at 19.00.

594
01:09:34,201 --> 01:09:36,032
You know...

595
01:09:40,601 --> 01:09:43,957
None of this really needs to happen.

596
01:09:44,161 --> 01:09:47,119
lf everyone just followed the rules.
Everything would be easier.

597
01:09:47,321 --> 01:09:51,678
That's what rules are for.
Why should your friend have to suffer

598
01:09:51,881 --> 01:09:55,874
just because you think
you are above everyone else.

599
01:09:56,081 --> 01:09:59,835
You should give some thought to that.

600
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:08,353
Come on.

601
01:10:18,401 --> 01:10:23,156
Silverhielm is cruel.
He's an evil human being. But why?

602
01:10:23,361 --> 01:10:27,798
Was he born like that or has he been
here too long, maybe beaten as well...

603
01:10:28,001 --> 01:10:29,798
That's how the system works, isn't it?

604
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:33,277
Kicked around in the Lower Form?
Revenge later on...

605
01:10:33,481 --> 01:10:37,474
That's why it just continues.
Does it hurt?

606
01:10:37,681 --> 01:10:40,957
l just know that people like
Silverhielm have to be fought.

607
01:10:41,161 --> 01:10:45,359
Someone like him must never win.
Not now or ever. That's it!

608
01:10:50,081 --> 01:10:52,356
Have you seen Pierre?
No.

609
01:10:52,561 --> 01:10:54,756
Have you seen Pierre?
No.

610
01:10:54,961 --> 01:10:57,794
Have you seen Pierre?!
Not since the maths class.

611
01:10:58,001 --> 01:11:01,676
ls it true he's been called
to the ring tonight?

612
01:11:06,161 --> 01:11:08,197
You don't have to do it.

613
01:11:08,401 --> 01:11:12,713
lt doesn't matter what you say.
l've already decided.

614
01:11:14,641 --> 01:11:17,633
l'm going to do it.
Why?

615
01:11:17,841 --> 01:11:22,471
Otherwise it'll just carry on. lf l do
it now, maybe they'll leave me alone.

616
01:11:22,681 --> 01:11:26,356
Wasn't that what you said yourself?
''Might as well get it out of the way.''

617
01:11:26,561 --> 01:11:29,553
But you're not like me, Pierre.
l can fight.

618
01:11:29,761 --> 01:11:32,594
Not a bit, more than you can imagine!

619
01:11:32,801 --> 01:11:36,760
l've been fighting my whole life, and
once you've done that it never ends.

620
01:11:36,961 --> 01:11:41,557
But help me then.
Show me! Teach me how to fight.

621
01:11:41,761 --> 01:11:44,116
You can't learn to fight.
Why? Am l too weak?

622
01:11:44,321 --> 01:11:48,394
lt's not about that. lt's completely
different. Something in your head.

623
01:11:48,601 --> 01:11:51,798
Let's forget it. l'll take the pepperpot
and l'll clean their bloody shoes.

624
01:11:52,001 --> 01:11:55,038
You don't seem to understand.
lt's too late.

625
01:11:55,241 --> 01:11:57,357
How is it going to help,
you getting beaten up?

626
01:11:57,561 --> 01:12:01,270
How do you know l will?
Get beaten up...

627
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:06,714
You're not the only one who can fight.
People like Silverhielm must disappear.

628
01:12:06,921 --> 01:12:10,709
Who said that?
l wish l could take your place.

629
01:12:10,921 --> 01:12:14,675
What? Why?
Do you think you're better than me?

630
01:12:14,881 --> 01:12:18,317
Maybe Silverhielm was right. You like
putting yourself above the rest of us.

631
01:12:18,521 --> 01:12:24,153
Because you keep quiet when they
burn you with a cigarette. That's sick!

632
01:12:24,361 --> 01:12:26,317
So what do you want me to do?

633
01:12:26,521 --> 01:12:29,354
lt doesn't matter what you say.

634
01:12:29,561 --> 01:12:32,758
l'm going into the ring anyway.

635
01:12:32,961 --> 01:12:35,953
Okay, be an idiot then!

636
01:12:45,161 --> 01:12:48,073
FlGHT, FlGHT, FlGHT!

637
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:13,795
Pierre Tanguy,
come and get your punishment!

638
01:13:20,401 --> 01:13:22,551
Come on, Tanguy!

639
01:13:23,681 --> 01:13:26,275
Come on, little Piggy!

640
01:13:37,161 --> 01:13:39,516
TANGUY, TANGUY, TANGUY!

641
01:13:58,241 --> 01:14:02,917
Will you do as you're told from
now on, or carry on being cheeky?

642
01:14:05,041 --> 01:14:09,637
Do you promise to do as you're told?
No, you coward, you bloody swine!

643
01:14:10,521 --> 01:14:15,151
What did you call me?
A swine! A stinking swine!

644
01:14:15,361 --> 01:14:17,556
Can we hear that again?
''Shittyhielm!''

645
01:14:18,641 --> 01:14:20,313
One more time?

646
01:14:20,521 --> 01:14:22,477
''Shittyhielm!''

647
01:14:28,201 --> 01:14:30,795
On your knees!

648
01:14:32,121 --> 01:14:34,635
Get down on your knees!

649
01:14:34,841 --> 01:14:36,399
Never!

650
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:14,475
What's the time?
Almost 9.

651
01:15:14,681 --> 01:15:17,514
Have you had any sleep?
Yes, a bit.

652
01:15:19,441 --> 01:15:23,593
You got in a good punch there.
Have you been practising on the quiet?

653
01:15:23,801 --> 01:15:28,795
No. l just lashed out, sort of.

654
01:15:29,001 --> 01:15:33,711
Don't worry. l'll have a word with
Silverhielm. This is going to stop.

655
01:15:34,161 --> 01:15:39,713
l have to go to my house arrest now.
See you tonight. Will you be okay?

656
01:15:44,601 --> 01:15:46,193
Erik...

657
01:15:48,681 --> 01:15:50,034
See you later.

658
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:52,277
Yes, see you later.

659
01:15:59,961 --> 01:16:04,876
Rat! One of the boys in 2:5 is sick,
so you must do his punishment duties.

660
01:16:05,081 --> 01:16:08,357
But l have to go up to house arrest.
Don't give me lip!

661
01:16:08,561 --> 01:16:10,119
Here...

662
01:16:22,281 --> 01:16:27,639
These have to be put into the ground
in a 2x2 metre square. Firm as a rock!

663
01:16:27,841 --> 01:16:31,277
Then you can go to your arrest.
Yes.

664
01:16:31,481 --> 01:16:33,153
Good. Get to work!

665
01:16:43,801 --> 01:16:47,032
A THOUSAND AND ONE NlGHTS

666
01:16:57,361 --> 01:17:00,637
You can go and have some food now.

667
01:17:20,721 --> 01:17:23,394
No. Let me go!

668
01:17:34,841 --> 01:17:37,196
Let me go!

669
01:17:41,921 --> 01:17:45,994
l hope you put the stakes in properly.

670
01:17:52,161 --> 01:17:54,914
We'll take your dick last of all.

671
01:17:56,761 --> 01:17:59,275
How does it feel, then?
Are you scared?

672
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:04,355
l'm never going to be scared of you,
''Shittyhielm.''

673
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:11,190
Start with the warm water.

674
01:18:11,401 --> 01:18:13,073
Pour it on!

675
01:18:13,281 --> 01:18:15,715
LE'TS BOlL RAT! BOlL RAT!

676
01:18:20,881 --> 01:18:24,635
Pour it on! Pour it!
l don't want to!

677
01:18:32,201 --> 01:18:36,956
Looks like you need cooling down, Rat!
 Cold water!

678
01:18:41,561 --> 01:18:44,519
Let him stay there.

679
01:18:44,721 --> 01:18:47,519
We can't leave him there.
He'll freeze to death.

680
01:18:47,721 --> 01:18:50,076
You shut up!

681
01:19:40,401 --> 01:19:43,916
Are you cold?
Yes, a little.

682
01:21:30,321 --> 01:21:34,678
<i>Dear Erik, by the time you read
this letter, l'll have left Stjrnsberg.</i>

683
01:21:34,881 --> 01:21:38,840
<i>Don't think l'm a coward. l tried
to hold out for as long as l could.</i>

684
01:21:39,041 --> 01:21:43,114
<i>There is so much l want to say,
but the taxi is coming in a minute.</i>

685
01:21:43,321 --> 01:21:47,633
<i>Anyway, l want you to know that
you're the best friend l've ever had.</i>

686
01:21:47,841 --> 01:21:51,117
<i>lf you like you can write to me
at my mother's address in Stockholm.</i>

687
01:21:51,321 --> 01:21:54,279
<i>Your affectionate friend, Pierre.</i>

688
01:21:54,481 --> 01:21:58,679
<i>PS. l didn't have space for my works
of Strindberg and the gramophone.</i>

689
01:21:58,881 --> 01:22:01,839
<i>Please make full use of them.</i>

690
01:22:26,681 --> 01:22:28,512
Come in!

691
01:22:35,361 --> 01:22:37,511
Hello, Erik.
Hello.

692
01:22:39,081 --> 01:22:41,037
Am l disturbing?
No.

693
01:22:41,241 --> 01:22:44,870
You've been lying here for four days.
Shouldn't l ask matron to look at you?

694
01:22:45,081 --> 01:22:48,835
No. l feel much better.

695
01:22:49,041 --> 01:22:54,798
The rumours are flying.
l've heard that...

696
01:22:55,001 --> 01:22:59,233
...Silverhielm went over the top
this time. What exactly happened?

697
01:22:59,441 --> 01:23:01,591
Nothing.

698
01:23:04,561 --> 01:23:08,759
Very sad about Pierre.
lt really is.

699
01:23:17,241 --> 01:23:22,395
What kind of freaks are you? Don't
you understand what you've done?

700
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:27,476
Pierre was one of the most gifted
students we've ever had here.

701
01:23:28,721 --> 01:23:33,749
You and he were close friends, Erik.
Couldn't you have defended him?

702
01:23:33,961 --> 01:23:39,433
Why didn't you defend him?
At least give me an answer!

703
01:23:39,641 --> 01:23:44,237
Why didn't you defend him?
Are you as cowardly as the others?

704
01:23:44,441 --> 01:23:48,400
You get expelled
if you fight with a council member.

705
01:23:52,041 --> 01:23:55,556
The thing that separates humans
from animals

706
01:23:55,761 --> 01:23:58,958
is not only intelligence,
it's also morality.

707
01:23:59,161 --> 01:24:02,551
The ability to know the difference
between good and evil.

708
01:24:02,761 --> 01:24:07,039
You have all behaved like animals.
Like vultures.

709
01:24:07,241 --> 01:24:12,076
lt's undignified!
Do you hear me? Undignified!

710
01:24:12,681 --> 01:24:15,832
This has to stop.

711
01:24:20,361 --> 01:24:24,274
l don't think sir understands exactly
what's happened here.

712
01:24:26,881 --> 01:24:29,793
That'll be all for today. Thank you.

713
01:24:35,081 --> 01:24:38,915
The ring in one hour.
Bring von Schenken with you.

714
01:25:12,801 --> 01:25:17,397
After much deliberation, Rat has
decided to accept the challenge.

715
01:25:17,601 --> 01:25:22,152
Teach him a lesson
in the true spirit of Stjrnsberg.

716
01:25:22,361 --> 01:25:25,034
You may start.

717
01:25:29,841 --> 01:25:34,676
l've got a question. Do l have to hit
both or is it enough if one crawls out?

718
01:25:34,881 --> 01:25:39,830
lt's over once you crawl out, or...
if both punisment prefects crawl out.

719
01:25:40,041 --> 01:25:43,920
Good. Just one more question.
Can l hit them as much as l like?

720
01:25:44,121 --> 01:25:47,158
Fight!
l was thinking about you, Dahln.

721
01:25:47,361 --> 01:25:52,993
l thought l might break your nose.
 And you! Left or righthanded?

722
01:25:54,641 --> 01:25:56,313
Righthanded.

723
01:25:56,521 --> 01:26:00,639
Very well.
l'll break your left arm at the elbow.

724
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:03,958
Don't talk so bloody much, Rat!

725
01:26:14,761 --> 01:26:16,752
We said the nose, didn't we?

726
01:26:21,441 --> 01:26:24,035
Crawl!

727
01:26:24,201 --> 01:26:27,432
You too. Crawl!

728
01:26:28,841 --> 01:26:30,797
Crawl!

729
01:27:01,681 --> 01:27:06,436
Hello. l'd like to talk to Marja.
Can you ask her to come out?

730
01:27:09,161 --> 01:27:11,595
Marja doesn't work here any more.
What?

731
01:27:13,921 --> 01:27:17,470
She got fired. Three days ago.

732
01:27:17,681 --> 01:27:21,799
They had no proof,
but apparently they didn't need any.

733
01:27:22,001 --> 01:27:24,595
What do you mean, fired? For what?

734
01:27:24,801 --> 01:27:27,440
You should know.

735
01:27:39,441 --> 01:27:45,835
...and because Linn
called this groupe cryptogams

736
01:27:46,041 --> 01:27:49,954
with crypto indicating
''hidden'' or ''obscured''.

737
01:27:50,161 --> 01:27:56,555
This gives us ''hidden wedding''
or ''hidden fertilization''.

738
01:27:56,761 --> 01:27:59,116
Erik...

739
01:27:59,321 --> 01:28:01,676
Erik!
Yes?

740
01:28:01,881 --> 01:28:05,078
Are you alright?
l'm fine.

741
01:28:07,401 --> 01:28:10,359
And then we have the other group,
phanerogams...

742
01:28:10,801 --> 01:28:12,473
Von Leiven.

743
01:28:13,641 --> 01:28:15,472
Vinberg.

744
01:28:15,681 --> 01:28:17,353
Ponti.

745
01:28:27,521 --> 01:28:30,433
Ponti has a letter from Finland.

746
01:28:50,281 --> 01:28:52,397
Room search!

747
01:28:57,041 --> 01:28:59,191
l found it!

748
01:29:15,441 --> 01:29:18,797
This is even better than l thought.

749
01:29:22,241 --> 01:29:26,837
''Don't worry about me
getting with child with you.''

750
01:29:27,081 --> 01:29:31,996
That prostitute can't even put it in
proper Swedish!''With child with you!''

751
01:29:34,081 --> 01:29:38,916
''l had my diaphragm on.'' The stopper
on her head, not in her cunt?!

752
01:29:39,561 --> 01:29:41,119
Eh?

753
01:29:43,081 --> 01:29:46,073
''l'm sorry it all went so wrong.''

754
01:29:46,281 --> 01:29:49,591
''But l suppose it's both of our fault.''

755
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:54,670
''Maybe it's true l love you,
but not that l think we'll meet again.''

756
01:29:54,881 --> 01:29:58,396
l don't think so either!
You've fucked the kitchen whore!

757
01:29:58,601 --> 01:30:03,231
When the headmaster sees this
you'll be expelled straight away!

758
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:08,995
Stretch your legs a bit!

759
01:30:11,841 --> 01:30:15,754
And now sit down, gentlemen.
 Not you, Ponti!

760
01:30:17,721 --> 01:30:20,872
Go to the headmaster straight away!

761
01:30:21,081 --> 01:30:23,754
Take your things!

762
01:30:29,161 --> 01:30:30,913
Gentlemen!

763
01:30:33,481 --> 01:30:41,559
lt's November, the 6th of November
to be precise, 1632, Ltzen.

764
01:30:41,761 --> 01:30:43,672
Dense fog before us.

765
01:30:57,401 --> 01:30:59,312
Come in.

766
01:31:07,241 --> 01:31:11,996
lf l understand things right, you've
been having longterm problems...

767
01:31:12,201 --> 01:31:15,398
...finding your feet at Stjrnsberg.

768
01:31:18,281 --> 01:31:20,556
ls that right?

769
01:31:29,241 --> 01:31:33,712
Well, the school rules
are very clear on these matters.

770
01:31:33,921 --> 01:31:41,032
l have no alternative but to expel you
without matriculating from your year.

771
01:31:42,921 --> 01:31:48,120
l would prefer to have you
off school premises

772
01:31:48,321 --> 01:31:51,279
shall we say by 15.00 tomorrow.

773
01:31:51,481 --> 01:31:53,472
lt's my duty to inform your parents

774
01:31:53,681 --> 01:31:56,673
but l assume you'd prefer
to have a word with them first.

775
01:31:56,881 --> 01:31:59,953
The letter, may l have it back?

776
01:32:04,721 --> 01:32:10,398
What are you going to do with it?
Her address. l'd like to write to her.

777
01:32:23,961 --> 01:32:28,989
The best thing you can do know
is to forget about that girl.

778
01:32:29,201 --> 01:32:32,113
<i>When you read this l have left...</i>

779
01:32:32,321 --> 01:32:35,438
<i>l tried for as long as l could...</i>

780
01:32:35,641 --> 01:32:37,597
<i>One thing l want you to know...</i>

781
01:32:37,801 --> 01:32:39,837
<i>Best friend l ever had.</i>

782
01:32:40,041 --> 01:32:43,716
<i>Maybe it's true l love you,
but not that l think we'll meet again.</i>

783
01:32:43,921 --> 01:32:45,274
Stop!

784
01:32:46,201 --> 01:32:51,116
Only members of this school
are allowed to eat here.

785
01:33:23,561 --> 01:33:24,994
Hello?

786
01:33:25,841 --> 01:33:28,230
<i>Who is it?</i>

787
01:33:28,521 --> 01:33:31,115
Erik, hello? Erik, is it you?

788
01:34:13,201 --> 01:34:15,669
lt's just the two of us now,
Silverhielm.

789
01:34:15,881 --> 01:34:20,033
lt's 2 kilometres to the stable
and even further to the school.

790
01:34:20,241 --> 01:34:23,551
You could make a run for it.
You're fairly quick.

791
01:34:23,761 --> 01:34:26,912
lf you go now, it'll take me
100 metres to catch up with you.

792
01:34:27,121 --> 01:34:30,079
What the hell are you talking about?
Down on your knees!

793
01:34:30,281 --> 01:34:35,355
You're bloody mad.
l said, down on your knees!

794
01:34:37,561 --> 01:34:41,315
What do you want? Money?
l'll give you 10 000. My word!

795
01:34:41,521 --> 01:34:44,752
1 0 000?! ls that all you're worth?
l'll give it to you tomorrow.

796
01:34:44,961 --> 01:34:48,636
l swear on my honour as a nobleman.
Your honour as a nobleman?

797
01:34:48,841 --> 01:34:53,869
Where was that when you tortured
Pierre? And when you struck me?

798
01:34:54,081 --> 01:34:56,151
You did everything to provoke me.

799
01:34:56,361 --> 01:34:58,670
Don't you understand the living hell
l had to endure with you?

800
01:34:58,881 --> 01:35:01,236
That ring, give it here!

801
01:35:05,001 --> 01:35:08,471
lt's the sort of thing they use
to identify a rotten old corpse.

802
01:35:08,681 --> 01:35:11,718
And the teeth, of course.

803
01:35:11,921 --> 01:35:18,076
You won't enjoy having all your teeth
out, but you won't feel a thing...

804
01:35:18,281 --> 01:35:21,079
Are you mad? They'll give you
a life sentence in prison.

805
01:35:21,281 --> 01:35:26,116
l've thought everything through.
No proof once l've burnt your clothes!

806
01:35:26,321 --> 01:35:30,473
Only Pierre and Marja will know
about it. l won't tell anyone else.

807
01:35:51,041 --> 01:35:54,397
Did you really think
l was going to kill you?

808
01:35:55,161 --> 01:36:00,030
l'm not like you, Silverhielm.
l'm not like you.

809
01:36:47,321 --> 01:36:50,438
GUNNAR EKENGREN
LAWYER

810
01:37:04,001 --> 01:37:06,674
Three cheers...

811
01:37:13,921 --> 01:37:16,071
Dear colleagues...

812
01:37:17,481 --> 01:37:21,315
l'm extremely moved by
all this kindness.

813
01:37:21,521 --> 01:37:24,877
And l'd very much like to say
on behalf of my wife and myself...

814
01:37:25,081 --> 01:37:27,834
l think we have a visitor.

815
01:37:30,441 --> 01:37:35,720
Ponti? Still here? l thought we had
concluded any remaining business.

816
01:37:35,921 --> 01:37:40,995
lt was the thing about the letter.
Maybe l didn't make myself clear.

817
01:37:41,201 --> 01:37:45,911
Some things have not been acceptable
in the sense of existing legislation...

818
01:37:46,121 --> 01:37:50,353
What are you talking about?
My right to privacy was violated.

819
01:37:50,561 --> 01:37:53,519
lf you keep the letter, it's a criminal
act according to Swedish law.

820
01:37:53,721 --> 01:37:58,590
What are you trying to say? Leave
the school premises immediately!

821
01:37:58,801 --> 01:38:02,510
Do you hear?
Excuse me if l'm interrupting things.

822
01:38:03,361 --> 01:38:05,795
Who are you?
This is my lawyer.

823
01:38:06,001 --> 01:38:09,550
The name is Ekengren.
Good day to you, gentlemen.

824
01:38:10,641 --> 01:38:17,752
Well, this is a rather sorry tale
for everyone involved, you might say.

825
01:38:17,961 --> 01:38:22,910
l've just had a long telephone call
with a good friend, a reporter.

826
01:38:23,121 --> 01:38:25,396
Who happens to work
for this newspaper.

827
01:38:25,601 --> 01:38:29,560
He was very interested
to hear about Erik's story.

828
01:38:29,761 --> 01:38:33,549
ln fact he'd like to come
and write a reportage on this school.

829
01:38:33,761 --> 01:38:38,152
And perhaps flesh out
Erik's story a bit more.

830
01:38:39,081 --> 01:38:44,633
However, you may not feel this sort
of publicity will be of benefit...

831
01:38:44,841 --> 01:38:47,753
l'm rather busy at the moment.
Perhaps we could...

832
01:38:47,961 --> 01:38:53,513
The legal implications
are already clearly set out here.

833
01:38:53,721 --> 01:38:56,440
l don't know what you think, Erik?

834
01:38:56,641 --> 01:39:00,190
Could we possibly avoid
making this a police matter?

835
01:39:01,081 --> 01:39:04,994
Maybe.
Excuse me, what is all this about?

836
01:39:08,081 --> 01:39:12,836
lf all the information has not been
squarely placed in front of me, then...

837
01:39:13,041 --> 01:39:15,999
Surely Headmaster has access
to all the information?

838
01:39:16,201 --> 01:39:20,114
As l say, if there are
certain circumstances

839
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:23,393
to which l have not been alerted

840
01:39:23,601 --> 01:39:27,560
then naturally l would like to
be told of them.

841
01:39:29,761 --> 01:39:33,640
lf you'll all excuse me. Have
some cake in the meantime!  Alma...

842
01:39:33,841 --> 01:39:37,390
The letter... May l have it back?

843
01:39:39,521 --> 01:39:41,000
Thanks.

844
01:39:41,201 --> 01:39:45,956
Behave for the rest of the term
and get in touch when you come back.

845
01:39:48,401 --> 01:39:53,316
lt's not my hope
but rather my conviction

846
01:39:53,521 --> 01:39:57,309
that you'll go into life
bearing something

847
01:39:57,521 --> 01:40:02,675
that we proudly call
the Stjrnsberg spirit.

848
01:40:20,641 --> 01:40:22,632
Good luck!

849
01:40:22,841 --> 01:40:25,799
Now it all begins. Good luck!

850
01:40:30,601 --> 01:40:35,277
Erik, if you see Pierre
give him my regards.

851
01:40:38,361 --> 01:40:41,876
Erik, take care of yourself.

852
01:41:18,721 --> 01:41:22,634
With these reports you'll get into
any Sixth Form college you like.

853
01:41:22,841 --> 01:41:28,473
But a D in General Behaviour!
ls that heading in the right direction?

854
01:41:28,681 --> 01:41:34,039
l mean, before you had a C.
And now you have a D.

855
01:41:34,241 --> 01:41:37,836
What's your explanation?

856
01:41:39,161 --> 01:41:42,198
ls it that Finnish whore?

857
01:41:44,001 --> 01:41:46,515
We've heard all about it.

858
01:41:46,721 --> 01:41:49,679
She was a waitress, just like you.

859
01:41:55,361 --> 01:41:58,512
We'll talk this over after dinner.

860
01:42:02,041 --> 01:42:06,637
What's the matter with you?
What are you staring at?

861
01:42:08,401 --> 01:42:11,871
What the hell are you staring at?

862
01:42:12,081 --> 01:42:17,075
What are you staring at?
You're coming with me!

863
01:42:21,321 --> 01:42:22,993
Erik!

864
01:42:25,401 --> 01:42:26,151
l'm sorry.

865
01:42:29,561 --> 01:42:32,837
Let's get this out of the way.
Please!

866
01:42:33,041 --> 01:42:35,874
What's going on here?
Now listen to me!

867
01:42:36,081 --> 01:42:39,517
lt's over. You're getting out of here.

868
01:42:41,241 --> 01:42:43,880
ln half an hour
you're going to be in hospital.

869
01:42:44,081 --> 01:42:49,758
You won't see, your nose will be
snapped, your arms will be broken.

870
01:42:49,961 --> 01:42:53,670
You won't dare tell anyone. You'll say
that you fell down the stairs.

871
01:42:53,881 --> 01:42:58,557
lf you get the police involved, they'll
find out what you've been doing to us.

872
01:42:58,761 --> 01:43:03,312
This is going to hurt a hell of a lot.
You'll be screaming until you pass out.

873
01:43:03,521 --> 01:43:09,357
l swear l'm really going to do it.
People like you have to be destroyed.

874
01:43:11,961 --> 01:43:15,510
This is the last time,
then never again.

875
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:46,919
l thought you'd be
in Savolaks by now.

876
01:43:47,121 --> 01:43:50,591
Where are you going?
To Geneva. Another school. Business.

877
01:43:50,801 --> 01:43:55,079
l thought you wanted to write.
Many things one wants to do! You?

878
01:43:55,281 --> 01:43:59,320
l've got a job in a legal firm
over the summer. As a messenger boy.

879
01:43:59,521 --> 01:44:03,150
l have to pay for my private tuition.
Forget that. We're friends.

880
01:44:03,361 --> 01:44:07,320
lt makes no difference to me.
Because you're rich.

881
01:44:16,001 --> 01:44:18,720
l'll be seeing you, Erik.
l'll be seeing you, Pierre.
