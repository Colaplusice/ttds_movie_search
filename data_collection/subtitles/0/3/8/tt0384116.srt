1
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:12,040
Commander Logar,
they're speaking English.

2
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,040
Can we have it in Turkish
from the start?

3
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,040
Sure thing!

4
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,800
l'd believe it if it were possible
however, this is no good.

5
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,480
What's no good, man?

6
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:09,560
Look dear, l've been a publisher
for 12 years now.

7
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,520
l've never seen
such a nonsense.

8
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,640
Are you listening?

9
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,320
Forget about publishing, this
is a UFO, something l've witnessed.

10
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,680
l've seen this, shouldn't
l have taken a picture?

11
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:25,000
Besides, l have a friend who made love
to an alien, l'll bring him to you.

12
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,800
Bring him, the other one too.
We'll create some synergy here.

13
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,880
-But these are fake.
-Hake?

14
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,440
Fake man fake... Phony.

15
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,240
lt says here Ktahya Porcelain.
Look.

16
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,440
Well, l shot this in Ktahya.
There's nothing wrong with it.

17
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:47,880
ldiot. Why are you
using a magnifier?

18
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:50,240
l've been on the road
for ten hours.

19
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,840
Which way are you going, son?

20
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,840
Hah! Just what l needed!
l'm going a long way pops. Move on.

21
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:58,200
-Give me a lift to...
-To where?

22
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:00,720
-Aren't you going this way?
-Alright, hop in.

23
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,760
Close the door...

24
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:09,240
-What's in the can?
-Pickles.

25
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:13,560
Let me turn it like this so it won't
fly away. lt's a cabrio after all.

26
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:15,840
You're well informed.

27
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,400
Would you mind
if l played some music?

28
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:40,240
-What kind of music?
-What?

29
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:43,200
-What kind of music?
-You are something...

30
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,200
l don't like foreign music. They might be
swearing at my mom. How shall l know?

31
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:51,600
-How old is your mother?
-My mom is alive and healthy at 93.

32
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:55,760
Fine. This band is very young, so they
wouldn't know your mother, don't worry.

33
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,840
Oh boy! Look at that view!

34
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:09,520
-Get out!
-What's up son? l hope nothing's wrong.

35
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,560
Get out. Stop talking.

36
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:18,440
Move.

37
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,240
Turn towards me.

38
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,560
Raise your arm.
We're gonna lose the light.

39
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,480
You talk too much.
Do something useful for a change.

40
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:35,040
-Shall l turn it like this?
-No, just hold your arm straight!

41
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:38,120
lnnocent villager sees a UFO.
You're the man!

42
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,320
Our esteemed
Japanese guests...

43
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:59,000
...this is a really
historical place. Translate.

44
00:06:07,560 --> 00:06:09,200
Yes, but...

45
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,200
Please, these are very sensitive,
newly painted.

46
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,320
What's he saying?

47
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:26,840
He wants you to
talk about the pictures.

48
00:06:27,080 --> 00:06:29,800
What's there to talk about?
They're pictures after all.

49
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,240
Let's lead them
to my carpet shop.

50
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,200
What's he saying?

51
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,920
My group is getting annoyed.

52
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,240
-Well, don't translate everything.
-How could l possibly not?

53
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:44,680
Translate this then: Apple pie and tart
make me fart hard.

54
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,280
You are really
killing tourism!

55
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:49,120
Cut it short.

56
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,480
Now we're going straight
to my shop.

57
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,640
We'll have a look at the carpets.
My shop is right nearby.

58
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,200
We'll get out...

59
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,920
Chill out, man!

60
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,440
Tourist or not,
l'll smack you one on the eye.

61
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,320
What's this talk
you rude bastard!

62
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,800
Lay down and l'll
show you what's really rude.

63
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,600
Dumb ass!

64
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:13,760
Don't make me go
Ninja on you!

65
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,160
Don't make me go
Ninja on you!

66
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,200
What's this, are you acting up?
You clown, come on.

67
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:29,120
Stop hitting! Give me my glasses.

68
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:32,760
You'll achieve nothing by yelling
in Japanese. Bastards!

69
00:07:34,760 --> 00:07:37,200
They make videos at home
and come over...

70
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:40,400
...to tour the country! Bastards!
And then we'll have a tourism boom.

71
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:42,280
That's some boom!

72
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,080
Arif.

73
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,600
Treasury officials asked for you.
What's up?

74
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,480
l was to receive a commendation from
the ministry. Are they gone?

75
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,160
Yeah. Hold on a minute.

76
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
Look at this stuff. How is it?

77
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:02,880
This should be painted in grey.
There's no name on it, right?

78
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,680
-No.
-Boss?

79
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,720
English customers
are asking for you.

80
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,640
Good. Come over some time,
we'll create some synergy.

81
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,920
-What synergy, dude?
-Boss, the English...

82
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,880
Has Prince Charles popped up?
What's the big deal?

83
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,760
Well, of course!

84
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,960
Order tea.
Don't stare like an ox.

85
00:08:55,280 --> 00:08:56,960
Fuck it, order anyway.

86
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:12,760
This one's crappy.

87
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,000
What are you going to say about this?

88
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:28,240
Don't ask the chick.
Why are you asking her?

89
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,280
Lady?

90
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,160
Nuri!

91
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,720
Look.

92
00:10:09,760 --> 00:10:11,160
This carpet here...

93
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,720
...has an authentic design
and is very valuable.

94
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:17,520
This pattern is called ''Hand
on the waist''. Trust me on this...

95
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,720
...the kid who wove this
went blind.

96
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,920
The price is $5000,
including surgery.

97
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,240
What did you give me to drink?

98
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:33,600
Arif lik. December, 8th, 1968.

99
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,600
You have been abducted by
the Goran Military lmport Unit.

100
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,520
-Excuse me?
-Go on.

101
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:41,600
From now on you are
property of the Goran Union.

102
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,800
-Transportal initiative transport--
-What are you talking about, lady?

103
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:48,600
My dear Earthling, l think you
don't get it. You've been abducted!

104
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:51,240
Get out of here man.
The outfit is fine...

105
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:54,040
...but we did these jokes
when we were kids.

106
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,960
Nice idea, nice location
but you can't fool me.

107
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:00,800
-What's going on, Cheeba?
-Unbelievable. l guess he's in shock.

108
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:03,040
Really? Are the force shields active?

109
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:06,080
Sure they are.
You don't give up, do you?

110
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:09,200
He'll recover in the cell.
Take him away.

111
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Dude, listen! Don't get on my nerves.

112
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:15,240
lt's no good with lights and all.
Are you going to buy the rug or not?

113
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,600
Plackumates, take him to his cell.

114
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:20,200
Bugger off! Tufan, is that you, dog?
Take off your glasses!

115
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:21,800
Take him away!

116
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,080
What was the technique?

117
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,360
Put a little effort into it, man!

118
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,720
Step back!

119
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:34,800
-Calm down.
-Shut up!

120
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:38,360
You freaked out, ha?

121
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,320
What now?

122
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:44,720
Are you going to kill us
with a flashlight?

123
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,080
Flashlight?

124
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:47,320
Oh shit...

125
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,640
Get this trash out of here!

126
00:11:50,920 --> 00:11:52,920
Don't let me see you fraternizing
with prisoners again.

127
00:11:53,160 --> 00:11:54,560
Get back to work.

128
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,640
-Engage MFD drives.
-Engaged.

129
00:11:56,880 --> 00:11:58,520
-Open the parallel port.
-Open.

130
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,280
-ls the joystick connected?
-Yes.

131
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,920
-ls targeting stabilized?
-Ready.

132
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:04,800
Lieutenant Zurka,
lower all shields.

133
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:06,880
Right away, sir.

134
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,840
What's going on there?

135
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:14,600
A Colombian
is causing trouble.

136
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:18,480
Why do you cause trouble
you worthless Earthling? Search him!

137
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:27,520
Powdered sugar, huh?

138
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:30,640
Get him out of here.
Send this to the kitchen.

139
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,240
Commander Logar,
the cargo is ready.

140
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:35,440
The numbers?

141
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,600
20 Americans, 5 of them black.

142
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,600
5 Japanese, one Colombian,
1 Danish, 3 lndian.

143
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:44,120
-Fine...
-And one Turk.

144
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:47,600
One day all Earthlings will work
under my command like dogs, Kuna.

145
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:49,320
We'll gather all of them.

146
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,760
Those days will come to pass, sir.
Commander Logar...

147
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:57,520
Why do you hate Earthlings
so much?

148
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:01,080
Why?! Why?!

149
00:13:01,520 --> 00:13:05,400
This is a hatred, Kuna. A hatred
l may never be able to overcome.

150
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,720
Years ago, something which happened
to my grandfather Commander Kubar...

151
00:13:09,960 --> 00:13:15,480
has affected me so greatly, that l can't
seem to shake my taste for vengeance.

152
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,480
Earthlings make me sick...

153
00:13:21,520 --> 00:13:26,560
July 14th, 1789- AKSARAY

154
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:19,520
What we do to these uncivilized
monkeys can never be enough, Kuna.

155
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:22,160
Commander Logar.
An object is approaching.

156
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:23,560
Who are you?

157
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,360
Get out, out!

158
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,200
Come on, come on.
Get a signal.

159
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:38,720
You were supposed to have
coverage everywhere. Come on!

160
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,040
Hello?

161
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,880
Hello, Muhittin,
This is Arif.

162
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:53,480
Bring in everybody,
even the US President.

163
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:55,680
l've been abducted by aliens.

164
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,280
What? Yes, by them.

165
00:14:58,520 --> 00:15:02,840
Stop that! Arif, cut the crap,
where are you? What are you doing?

166
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,760
Muhittin, this is not a joke.
Aliens, l said. l'm in a spaceship.

167
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:09,840
-What ship?
-Muhittin, speak up.

168
00:15:10,200 --> 00:15:12,680
Go to the police, to the station.
Hello!

169
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,760
The signal is breaking up.
Call me back.

170
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:21,080
He must be drunk or what.

171
00:15:22,640 --> 00:15:25,240
Hello, Muhittin, Muhittin.
lt's no joke. l'm telling you, aliens!

172
00:15:28,760 --> 00:15:31,560
Oh merciful and most gracious...

173
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,560
-Do not fear.
-You don't say!

174
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:36,920
My God, what kind of a test
are you putting me through?

175
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:40,240
Listen carefully.
The Force is inside you.

176
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,880
Don't lose control.
You'll get away and find me.

177
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:48,840
Who are you? l can't even tell
if you're a genie or a human.

178
00:15:49,680 --> 00:15:50,680
Damn!

179
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,080
Damn!

180
00:15:52,280 --> 00:15:55,960
Stop it. Listen,
you're the chosen one.

181
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,440
Find me when you land on Gora.
Got it?

182
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,320
Find me.

183
00:16:01,640 --> 00:16:04,120
Daddyo, did you
run out of chosen ones?

184
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,760
-Who are you? What's going on?
-The signal is fading, find me.

185
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:09,000
The phone has no signal,
the dude has no signal.

186
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,320
What's a chosen one?
l left the shop unattended.

187
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:15,560
Arif, you shit for brains!

188
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,080
Prisoner, turn around.

189
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,880
Want me to lay down naked too?
What are you talking about, man?

190
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:24,160
Don't cause trouble, turn around.

191
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:25,600
OK!

192
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,960
Look, pal, l know
my way around.

193
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:37,720
You look like a nice person, take this,
there has been a misunderstanding...

194
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,920
...let's forget it.
l want good treatment.

195
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:44,680
l'm Arif. Take this and say,
''Mr Arif wants some olives...

196
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:48,920
...a loaf of bread, some cheese
and toilet paper.

197
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:51,040
Come on, take it!

198
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:59,400
Whoa! There are families who live
a whole month on that money!

199
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:05,200
Could you get at least
a charger for my mobile?

200
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,640
Yo, man in black!

201
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:18,560
ls the ship drifting
a little to the left, Kuna?

202
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,720
-Which ship, dude?
-Dude?

203
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:25,760
Commander Logar,
an object is approaching, Sir.

204
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,280
That's our planet, moron!
Who are you?

205
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:30,960
Get out, out!

206
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:34,680
l want a nice landing, Kuna.

207
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:00,840
Whoa!

208
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:03,520
-Prisoner, come with me.
-Out! Out!

209
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,080
Alright, l'm coming.
Get out. Please!

210
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:10,040
Listen, if you tell anyone
what you saw back there...

211
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:13,200
...we'll be on real bail terms. Got it?
That's a human urge.

212
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:17,920
Those bastards have abducted
the whole world.

213
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,480
The ship has landed.
Anyone stepping out of line...

214
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,480
...or over reacting
will be severely punished.

215
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,040
l don't speak German.

216
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,800
l don't speak German, OK?

217
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:48,400
He has stunned the guy.
lt doesn't kill, it only stuns.

218
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,600
That's a stunner,
they've used it on me too.

219
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,800
Hello, hang up, l'll call you.
l can't talk right now.

220
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:09,080
-Get back in line!
-Don't get so anal about everything!

221
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:12,080
Get back in line here,
he's putting the blame on me!

222
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,680
Move on a little.

223
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,400
-Commander Logar.
-Superior Tocha.

224
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:41,760
Welcome.

225
00:19:43,560 --> 00:19:44,680
My respects, Mulu.

226
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,160
Welcome.

227
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:52,000
You've gathered the whole world again.
Didn't you have enough slaves, Logar?

228
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:55,920
What happened to your face
Rendroy?

229
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:59,080
-What's with my face?
-That's what l mean. What?

230
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:02,040
Superior Tocha.

231
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:05,200
Allow me to present you some
presents l brought from the Earth.

232
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,560
Kuna!

233
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:10,320
This is yours, sir. Pish...

234
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,760
Pishmaniye. Cotton candy from zmit.

235
00:20:13,120 --> 00:20:14,560
Here you are.

236
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,040
-Mulu.
-You're kind as usual, Logar.

237
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,200
Vunar, this is for you.

238
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,560
Enverina, we lost your
present on the ship.

239
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,440
We didn't notice.

240
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:33,640
And this is yours Rendroy,
it's supposed to bring fertility.

241
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,360
You're very kind, Logar. Keep this,
l have three from birth.

242
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:47,000
Your daughter Ceku
is not here to welcome me.

243
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,760
-Yes, she doesn't feel well.
-Really?

244
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
Let's go.

245
00:20:55,800 --> 00:20:57,440
What time is it, pal?

246
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,520
That idiot, Superior Tocha
is 420 years old, Kuna.

247
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:13,160
He should give way
to the young.

248
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:16,280
Ceku didn't come to meet you,
she shows no interest, huh?

249
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:19,920
She's going to. Let's see
what she's done while we were away.

250
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:22,040
-Get me 216.
-Yes, sir.

251
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,000
Hi, brother.

252
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,120
Hello.

253
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:51,240
You two, come over.

254
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,720
Us?

255
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:01,040
Space has always been
the unknown to me.

256
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:06,680
The movies, science-fiction novels.
Arthur C. Clarke. Chariots of the Gods.

257
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:11,000
l can't believe l'm here.
Space Odyssey.

258
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,520
-ldiot.
-ldiot.

259
00:22:14,760 --> 00:22:15,840
Next.

260
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,720
You've turned this place into a
government office. ''Go here, no there.''

261
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:25,400
Greetings,
shall l sit or stand?

262
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,520
-Tell us.
-Tell us.

263
00:22:29,800 --> 00:22:32,800
l'll tell. We bought the goods
from Black Faik.

264
00:22:33,280 --> 00:22:35,360
We reloaded the truck
in Karabk.

265
00:22:35,560 --> 00:22:37,320
l was driving the truck
till Adana.

266
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:39,440
-What are you talking about?
-And you?!

267
00:22:39,640 --> 00:22:41,600
You've abducted me,
you'll do the talking.

268
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,120
l'm confused anyway.

269
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,880
-Aggressive.
-Aggressive.

270
00:22:45,120 --> 00:22:46,600
Yeah, aggressive.

271
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,240
ls that it?

272
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,880
Commander Logar?

273
00:23:18,040 --> 00:23:20,320
216, come on, fill me in.

274
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:25,200
-She missed you a lot.
-Really? That much, huh?

275
00:23:25,600 --> 00:23:28,120
Well, she kept on
saying your name.

276
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:29,400
Let me see.

277
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:31,040
Logar, you ...!

278
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,160
Good.
Did she mention marriage?

279
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,760
l saw her preparing
her dowry.

280
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,000
-ls she in her room?
-Yes.

281
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:44,880
Great. Take this my boy. l brought it
for you from Earth, you'll be friends.

282
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:48,920
Thank you very much
Commander Logar.

283
00:23:49,280 --> 00:23:52,960
l have the batteries. Come to me
when you want to play, alright?

284
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,440
Concentrate on your work now.

285
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,080
ls the beautiful Ceku
thinking about me?

286
00:24:24,520 --> 00:24:25,800
No.

287
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,960
l've come a long way.
No welcome?

288
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,840
From slave gathering?

289
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:34,120
Yoga didn't do you any good,
you're tense.

290
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:36,600
l've brought you
a present from Earth.

291
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:38,360
Really? What is it?

292
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,320
World peace.

293
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:45,320
An authentic carpet, the kid who made
this went blind. A valuable piece.

294
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:49,200
l don't want any presents from you,
Logar, why don't you leave me alone?

295
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,080
Aren't you the most
beautiful girl on Gora?

296
00:24:51,280 --> 00:24:52,920
-Because of my father?
-What?

297
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:56,360
-Will you please leave me alone?
-But the present...

298
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,240
l don't like carpets, Logar.

299
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,880
Don't insult me in front
of my troops.

300
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,560
lt's highly decorative,
enjoy it.

301
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:14,400
Nice stuff,
l should get one too.

302
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,120
All prisoners should shower within
3 minutes and go to the dining hall.

303
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:23,320
l'm sure they'll give us
little pills instead of food.

304
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:26,880
You're drawing too much attention,
stop that.

305
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:16,560
-Do not fear.
-Dude, you're crossing the line here.

306
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,480
Brace yourself.
Don't go with the flow.

307
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:23,600
Find me. My name is Garavel.
Find me!

308
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,600
Goodness gracious.
Forgive my sins.

309
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,560
l almost got taken,
covered in soap.

310
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,440
l'm never picky when it comes to food.

311
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:44,760
Eat food, evade beating.
That's the motto. Pour it in.

312
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:48,160
Can l have more sauce?

313
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:50,400
That's your share. Move on.

314
00:26:50,920 --> 00:26:53,280
Just a minute, weren't you
the man who distributed soap?

315
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:56,960
-Cut it short, move on.
-Are you Turkish, buddy?

316
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,040
Get moving.

317
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:03,600
Everybody speaks Turkish, l don't
understand who is a Turk and who's not.

318
00:27:09,920 --> 00:27:11,800
Get a load of that pimp,
as if he's at the beach.

319
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:13,480
Hello.

320
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:17,880
God Almighty, save me from
this place before l kill someone.

321
00:27:26,160 --> 00:27:27,520
ls this place taken?

322
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,760
We have to escape.

323
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:49,840
Together, what do you say?

324
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,800
l chose you
because you're different.

325
00:27:55,400 --> 00:27:58,400
First of all, you're Japanese,
you're smart.

326
00:27:59,080 --> 00:28:02,960
lf we combine our efforts
we can make it back to Earth.

327
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,840
-What do you say, Samurai?
-Samurai?

328
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,960
-Yes.
-Our efforts?

329
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:13,960
-Don't let on.
-Together?

330
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:17,000
Combined.

331
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,520
Our efforts?

332
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,200
Cut it short. Let's get to know
each other, l'm Arif.

333
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:25,040
And l'm Mehmet, from Zeytinburnu.

334
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:27,560
l work in a leather factory
in Kazlesme.

335
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:31,800
Leather jackets or shoes and such?

336
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,160
Thanks.

337
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:45,240
From there.

338
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,400
From there.

339
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:51,040
Step aside.

340
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:01,040
ls this rose for me?

341
00:29:01,280 --> 00:29:02,360
Yes, dear.

342
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,560
What's your point in sending this?

343
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:08,080
To get close and nice.
To socialize.

344
00:29:08,520 --> 00:29:10,680
You mean to create a synergy
against the aliens?

345
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:13,840
Don't get mad,
come over here. Sit.

346
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,920
You are something.
A real Cosby Show!

347
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,720
Americans have a saying,
do you know it?

348
00:29:19,920 --> 00:29:20,920
What's that?

349
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,760
Shut up,
stop being a jerk!

350
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:31,200
Smarten up,
act like Earthlings!

351
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,320
Be worthy of our planet!

352
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Low class jerks! Let me go,
don't stress me out man!

353
00:29:45,520 --> 00:29:48,400
-Superior Tocha.
-Welcome, Logar.

354
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
You can't possibly know
how l envy you.

355
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:57,840
You're like my own children,
you'll lead Gora into better days.

356
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,480
Thanks.

357
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:04,880
l've grown old. l intend to marry
my daughter to a young Goran...

358
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:09,800
...and transfer all my authority
to him. What do you think?

359
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,560
A classical
but perfect idea, Sir.

360
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:14,440
l wanted to talk to you
about this matter.

361
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:19,800
For Gora's future l have Vumar's
son Timar in mind. How's that?

362
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,160
-Vumar's son Timar?
-But, Sir...

363
00:30:24,440 --> 00:30:26,240
Vumar's son Timar is...

364
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,040
God knows what they
say about me.

365
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,360
l put forward myself
for this noble duty.

366
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:34,360
-Your daughter and l are in love.
-She's burning with love.

367
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:37,640
-She never mentioned anything.
-That she's burning?

368
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:42,480
l wanted you to hear it from me. l'd be
honored to be your son-in-law.

369
00:30:43,160 --> 00:30:44,800
l don't believe in love, Logar.

370
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:48,480
Vumar's son Timar is a great
hero for the Gorans.

371
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:51,680
l rather entrust Gora's future...

372
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,040
...to a hero, instead of a lover.

373
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,000
Really?

374
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,320
-Commander Logar!
-Yes, my dear.

375
00:30:59,600 --> 00:31:01,840
-An object is closing in, Sir.
-Who's this?

376
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,040
Excuse me. Who are you?

377
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,320
Get out! Out! Out!

378
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:09,400
Out...

379
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,600
See you later, Superior Tocha.

380
00:31:16,800 --> 00:31:18,240
Good bye.

381
00:31:21,040 --> 00:31:22,400
Arif, buddy?

382
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:23,480
Yes?

383
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,840
We did you wrong today. Forgive us.

384
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:28,960
lt's alright, forget it.

385
00:31:29,200 --> 00:31:32,080
We're in space, everybody is confused.
lt's not a big deal.

386
00:31:35,800 --> 00:31:37,760
-ls everything fine now?
-Sure, man.

387
00:31:38,160 --> 00:31:41,600
You do that guy one more wrong
and you'll get a feel of this.

388
00:31:48,440 --> 00:31:51,560
You are really a phenomenon,
always up to something.

389
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,640
Was this your bed?
Sorry, pal.

390
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:58,160
Sit down. Here, you
left these in the examination room.

391
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:00,800
l really appreciate it.

392
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,320
Let's get acquainted.

393
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:07,840
Arif lik. All sorts of
carpets, kilim, travel.

394
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,640
-Here.
-Fine. l'm Bob Marley Faruk.

395
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,240
-Are you Turkish, Bob Marley?
-Yes.

396
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,200
Great. Have one.

397
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,680
-l don't smoke.
-Really?

398
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,200
-Can you give me that one there?
-This one?

399
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:25,440
-Here.
-Thanks.

400
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,840
-How long have you been here, Bob?
-8 years.

401
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,720
Holy sh...what was that?

402
00:32:36,520 --> 00:32:38,000
l'm sorry.

403
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:40,520
8 years? l wouldn't stay
here 8 minutes.

404
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,400
You've disappointed me.

405
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:47,560
l had a bar in Kusadas. There was
great music, reggae.

406
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,800
-But it didn't fly?
-Nope.

407
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,080
l was in debt up to my ears.

408
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:58,000
The creditors came to kill me.
So l tied a rock on my neck.

409
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:00,560
l was about to jump from the jetty...

410
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:03,240
...and bang, l was in a spaceship.

411
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:07,120
Then a completely different world,
would you return?

412
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,800
Well...

413
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:12,440
Let's suppose l did return.
The creditors arrive:

414
00:33:13,320 --> 00:33:14,960
''Where have you been Bob?''

415
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,840
''l was abducted by aliens and
so on.'' Would they buy it?

416
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,640
-They wouldn't.
-Nope.

417
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:22,920
Then there's the media.

418
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:25,840
You're making the headlines each day,
'The Man Abducted by Aliens''

419
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:29,800
-This seems to rub you wrong.
-You got that right.

420
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:33,920
l have nothing against space
but the attitude is wrong.

421
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:37,040
You expect something more civilized
when you think of aliens.

422
00:33:37,240 --> 00:33:39,440
-You're a prisoner here
-So?

423
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,120
Don't make me mad.
You're a prisoner. l'm comfortable.

424
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,320
That's because l work in the kitchen.

425
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:47,840
lf l were in the quarries...
They work you to death there.

426
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:51,200
They implant a chip and
you walk around like a monkey.

427
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:55,520
What's this man, quarry, chips..?
ls this being alien or human?

428
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,080
lf you'd like l can get you
a work in the kitchen too?

429
00:33:58,280 --> 00:34:00,760
What kitchen, pal? ls there no way
out of here?

430
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:04,440
-You have to find a ship.
-Easy. What's a space ship, anyway?

431
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,120
Alright, calm down, have patience.

432
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,800
These are the final finishes.
lt's finished, here.

433
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:15,120
-ls this some kind of a joke?
-Of course it is.

434
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,600
l mean it's impossible
to get away.

435
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:23,120
Quit saying that.
There's gotta be a way.

436
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,480
Excuse me Bob but you seem to be
a little oblivious to sci-fi.

437
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:29,960
l'm oblivious to sci-fi?
l'm oblivious, huh?

438
00:34:30,640 --> 00:34:33,560
You don't know who you're talking to,
so you talk nonsense.

439
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:35,440
What's your point?

440
00:34:35,880 --> 00:34:40,680
l was the first Turk
to write a science fiction scenario.

441
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,440
You said you had a bar.

442
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:46,680
That was after
l got fed up with the movie business.

443
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:49,040
So you got fed up with the movies?

444
00:34:50,680 --> 00:34:52,240
lt was years ago.

445
00:34:53,360 --> 00:34:56,080
ln the last days
of the sex movies.

446
00:34:56,320 --> 00:35:00,280
l was looking for
something new in movies.

447
00:35:01,320 --> 00:35:03,720
-September 12th, 1980
-No, sir, impossible.

448
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:07,640
My name is Ersan Kuneri,
l'm no porno producer.

449
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,800
l said they'll make love in underwear.
Of course.

450
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:15,560
The cook, the servant, the gardener. All
of them. lt takes place at a mansion.

451
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,440
The cook does the gardener, the
gardener the driver, the driver, servant.

452
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,320
Yes, get it printed,
l'll send a poster immediately.

453
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:26,560
The title is
''Group Discount''.

454
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:30,800
Stand straight,

455
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,720
Raise your chin.

456
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:37,800
Good.

457
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:39,200
Yes.

458
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,320
This, this, this.

459
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,880
Who are you?
Get out, out!

460
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,640
Be yourself,
don't imitate anyone!

461
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,680
Mr Ersan.
Should Faruk come in?

462
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,440
Keep him waiting.
Wait a second.

463
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,880
This, this.
Do you have blue underwear?

464
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:55,240
-Yes.
-Write down, brings his own underwear.

465
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:58,960
You, from Tophane, l want you to
make love like an animal, not human.

466
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,800
-Like a beast !
-Always.

467
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,200
Alright then, the movie's name is,
''Jackhammer.'' Beat it.

468
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,880
Send Faruk in.

469
00:36:06,840 --> 00:36:08,160
Mr Faruk.

470
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:13,800
Hi, Mr Ersan.

471
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,360
l see a tank outside.
Was there a parade today?

472
00:36:16,560 --> 00:36:19,080
Nothing important.
l have great ideas.

473
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,800
A fresh approach in movies,
science fiction. What do you say?

474
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,560
Science? Give me that.

475
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,520
Americans are into this thing,
there's lot of money in this.

476
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,800
Any sex?

477
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,120
No, it's about a robot's
adventures.

478
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:33,440
The title is ''6 Million Dollar Man.''
How's that?

479
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,880
6 million?
Do you want to ruin me?

480
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:37,960
Foreign currency
is prohibited.

481
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:39,760
We could change the title.

482
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:42,720
-Like?
-Lunar Lust. How's that?

483
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,880
lt can't be on the moon.
We have to shoot in one week.

484
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:48,480
We'll do it. A robot falls in love
with an astronaut.

485
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,800
Nice...
Lunar Lust. Nice.

486
00:36:52,080 --> 00:36:54,840
Could l have an advance,
l'll scout for a location.

487
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:57,160
Let's celebrate this.
l have Kent, Marlboro.

488
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:01,200
Mr Ersan,
the police is here.

489
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:04,120
They want to entertain you
for possessing foreign cigarettes.

490
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,320
That's not entertain,
that's detain. Let's go.

491
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,120
There's no escape from law.

492
00:37:09,480 --> 00:37:13,000
Ersan...The film.
Science-fiction. What now?

493
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,560
That film is not going to happen.

494
00:37:15,960 --> 00:37:19,880
Let's go to bed now. Don't ever
mention science-fiction to me again.

495
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,880
Thanks. They bring me
everything from Earth.

496
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,200
Hey, whoa! Slice it carefully!

497
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:43,920
These guys have chips,
half of their brain is gone.

498
00:37:44,320 --> 00:37:46,560
Hand it over,
let me do that.

499
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,240
Come on, you've wasted it.

500
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:49,920
But the guys are okay.

501
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:53,600
So it seems. You have it nice going
here but please think about...

502
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,960
...this escape business.

503
00:37:58,200 --> 00:38:01,720
Cut the crap and let me
tell you how to escape.

504
00:38:01,960 --> 00:38:03,160
Yeah.

505
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:08,200
First try the ventilation shafts
from the kitchen.

506
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:10,360
-Ventilation?
-Yes.

507
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:28,160
Did you all run away too?

508
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:31,680
Whoa, don't cut in here.
So you think you're smart, huh?

509
00:38:32,040 --> 00:38:34,440
Why smart, man?
l came to get food.

510
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:37,280
And there's another thing,
that could do.

511
00:38:37,520 --> 00:38:39,080
What's it? Tell me?

512
00:38:43,040 --> 00:38:44,080
Close it.

513
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,240
Close it.

514
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,880
You are way too curious.
l'm out of here.

515
00:39:01,360 --> 00:39:03,280
Can we flee
right through there, buddy?

516
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:08,240
Why do you take off the helmet?

517
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:11,160
lf that doesn't work, there's
molecular transportation.

518
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,360
-No wonder. What's that?
-Beaming, you know.

519
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:17,840
Do l know? lf there's beaming
l'll be directly at home.

520
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,720
Beaming is a risky business, you have
to enter the exact coordinates.

521
00:39:22,920 --> 00:39:25,480
l'm willing to risk it.
l have to get out of here.

522
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:28,920
lt's impossible to flee.
You don't get it, do you?

523
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:30,360
Sorry, Bob but...

524
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,600
...you call yourself Bob Marley but have
no hint about the philosophy behind it.

525
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:35,760
Just wearing that cap is not enough.

526
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,640
And what is
that philosophy?

527
00:39:40,640 --> 00:39:42,640
Get me a stick
and a piece of cloth.

528
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:46,080
l'll show you beaming...

529
00:39:46,880 --> 00:39:49,440
You'll see... You know
nothing about Arif yet.

530
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,080
Don't lose hope.
The Force is inside you.

531
00:39:56,320 --> 00:40:00,960
Yeah, right! lnside. Just appear
in light, no help at all.

532
00:40:01,320 --> 00:40:02,960
Just show off, bastard!

533
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,320
l'll show you all,
you bastards....

534
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,360
Beaming, yeah? Beaming.
There we are.

535
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,920
What are you doing here?

536
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:22,080
l don't have bucket, if l had one
l could do something.

537
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,480
What do you mean?

538
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:26,160
Commander Logar instructed me
to clean this place.

539
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,920
Move!

540
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:30,640
Why then? You've turned
the planet into a shithole.

541
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:33,160
Behave like women for a change
and clean this place.

542
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,520
What are you doing here?

543
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:14,400
Ma'am, l beg you, just let me
wipe off the dust of the beaming room.

544
00:41:14,600 --> 00:41:15,680
Move.

545
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:19,320
Some guy came and said ''The prisoner
shall wipe the dust of that place.''

546
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,560
l swear. He said ''No beaming,
only dust.''

547
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:26,280
Don't squeeze my arm.
He only said cleaning.

548
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,040
Damn you all...

549
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:11,560
To hell with such a beaming...

550
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:14,400
Leave me alone!

551
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:57,200
Oh, l'm exhausted. Sometimes
l forget that you're a robot.

552
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,680
Come on, l'm useless as a robot now.

553
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,080
l go wild when l'm with you,
otherwise l have direct robot logic.

554
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,680
The music was fantastic.

555
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:09,240
Wasn't it? l've downloaded
3000 of them from the lnternet.

556
00:43:10,600 --> 00:43:12,880
Look, what l have.

557
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:17,280
Oh, l don't believe it. A Turkish movie
where the girl goes blind.

558
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:19,680
No, in this movie the boy goes blind.

559
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,040
Why don't they use microlaser on the
girl's cornea, in that movie?

560
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:26,200
Come on Ceku,
is that the way to watch movies?

561
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,120
Just look at the emotions. The sacrifice
of the boy, his kiss in the final scene.

562
00:43:31,320 --> 00:43:32,960
Let's play ''Kiss like the Earthlings''.

563
00:43:33,160 --> 00:43:34,640
No, my circuits
still waggle from the dance.

564
00:43:34,840 --> 00:43:36,440
Come on, please.

565
00:43:37,640 --> 00:43:38,880
Okay, okay.

566
00:43:39,320 --> 00:43:43,160
-The Earthlings are fun, aren't they?
-With their music, dance and everything.

567
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,480
-Will you tell my fortune?
-ls it cold now?

568
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:49,760
Move a little.

569
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:53,200
-You know l don't do this for everyone.
-l know.

570
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,200
-Promise in God's name.
-Come on.

571
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:00,920
Let's see. There's someone.

572
00:44:01,120 --> 00:44:03,200
-Really?
-Oh, that's me.

573
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:06,840
-Come on, tell something.
-Be quiet.

574
00:44:07,120 --> 00:44:10,160
Look, in the near future.
Do you see, all in black.

575
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:13,080
With long hair.
Could that be Logar?

576
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,840
-Yuck! ln my fortune?
-l see a wedding.

577
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:22,640
There's someone else. He's
a little chubby, very straight words.

578
00:44:22,840 --> 00:44:26,360
He has lots of people around him.
He will do you a favor.

579
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,720
Don't forget, the letter R is in his
name or surname. Don't forget.

580
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:31,480
Rinse this out.

581
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,480
He asked about you the minute
he arrived.

582
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:34,880
What did you say?

583
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:37,640
l talked very directly. l said
''You have other things on your mind.''

584
00:44:37,840 --> 00:44:41,240
''Don't push her.'' l said. ''She's not
willing, so why do you push her?''

585
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:45,040
''Nothing good comes from force,
it will cause bigger problems...

586
00:44:45,240 --> 00:44:47,720
...in the future.'' l said.
But he wouldn't listen.

587
00:44:47,960 --> 00:44:49,560
Are you an oracle?

588
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,760
Commander Logar?

589
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,720
Commander Logar,
l was only joking.

590
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,080
Take this battery powered
doll away.

591
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:01,320
Put him together with
those dogs from Earth.

592
00:45:01,560 --> 00:45:03,520
You scum, he was my best friend.

593
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,080
You force me to be evil,
do you understand?

594
00:45:06,320 --> 00:45:09,720
l love you, l'm jealous of you.
Be it a robot or even my father.

595
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,200
So, you love me?

596
00:45:12,320 --> 00:45:14,600
l want this,
can you do it?

597
00:45:15,320 --> 00:45:16,400
216!

598
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:18,720
Disgusting Earth
customs.

599
00:45:22,800 --> 00:45:25,160
The prisoners to be implanted
a chip today are:

600
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:27,440
Jack Bailey.

601
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:29,960
Chris Lover.

602
00:45:30,760 --> 00:45:32,800
Guenter Westinghouse.

603
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:35,000
Jos Gabriel Estevez.

604
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,040
Will U. Marry Mee.

605
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,200
Akimi Noname.

606
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:43,520
The Japanese guy is gone too.

607
00:45:43,760 --> 00:45:45,800
l see no rebellion here.

608
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,320
We won't get anywhere
just with my resistance.

609
00:45:48,560 --> 00:45:50,400
-Black won't move there.
-Really?!

610
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,440
But you moved
the white bishop here...

611
00:45:52,680 --> 00:45:54,720
Now start with black-white
in front of this guy.

612
00:45:54,920 --> 00:45:59,520
Give me 5, Julio. Let's start again,
that paging has confused me.

613
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:03,280
l'm confused.
lf only we had a camera.

614
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,640
l'd take pictures of this place.
Would be a super document on Earth.

615
00:46:11,000 --> 00:46:12,640
Let me go, man!

616
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:15,760
There's another one.
Welcome to the circus.

617
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:18,560
Get a load of that guy.

618
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:21,800
Don't leave me here,
don't leave me with them!

619
00:46:22,000 --> 00:46:25,120
Don't cry,
we experienced the same.

620
00:46:25,480 --> 00:46:27,760
Don't shout, you're drawing
too much attention.

621
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:29,800
He's a robot.

622
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,720
Take him with you to the kitchen,
he'll make a nice kitchen robot.

623
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:37,800
Don't cause trouble.
He's a robot, an android.

624
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:40,440
Really? Hi, Robot.

625
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:42,640
Hi.

626
00:46:42,920 --> 00:46:44,120
Are you a robot?

627
00:46:44,320 --> 00:46:45,320
Yes.

628
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:46,920
So, what are you doing here?

629
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:48,880
Commander Logar has punished me.

630
00:46:49,120 --> 00:46:51,360
Commander Logar?
l'm going to kick his butt.

631
00:46:51,640 --> 00:46:54,440
Here, have one.
What's your name?

632
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:56,680
216.

633
00:46:56,960 --> 00:46:58,800
216? What's that?

634
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:04,240
Updated model of 215. 2. Generation,
16th segment, improvable intelligence.

635
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:07,760
And high mobility,
7 hours audio and video recording.

636
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:11,920
Audio recording? Does that mean
that you can receive from anywhere?

637
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:14,080
What kind of a talk is that?

638
00:47:14,360 --> 00:47:16,440
Well, what else should l ask a robot?

639
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:20,760
Would you like a drink?
Are you hungry?

640
00:47:22,280 --> 00:47:25,120
Such a pity...
He's a prisoner, like us.

641
00:47:25,360 --> 00:47:27,960
A robot, but still miserable.
Does this thing come out?

642
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,720
l'm totally detachable.

643
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:32,280
Really? That's sad, man.

644
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:34,960
Hey, folks. Why don't you
say welcome? The guy's crying.

645
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:36,680
-Welcome, pal.
-Welcome.

646
00:47:37,120 --> 00:47:39,080
Maybe he's programmed to cry.

647
00:47:39,320 --> 00:47:41,240
This is so sad, look at him.

648
00:47:41,440 --> 00:47:44,040
l'm Faruk, Bob Marley Faruk.

649
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:45,160
Hi.

650
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:47,480
Can you shoot pictures
as well?

651
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:49,000
Excuse me?

652
00:47:49,200 --> 00:47:51,320
Never mind.
Say welcome, people.

653
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,760
Don't discriminate.
Robot or not, everyone's equal.

654
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:59,080
-Welcome. l'm Arif..
-Hi, 216.

655
00:48:27,040 --> 00:48:29,000
Do l eat red meat?

656
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:30,960
l'm sorry, sir.

657
00:48:33,840 --> 00:48:35,560
Why aren't you eating, Ceku?

658
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,000
l have no appetite.

659
00:48:37,240 --> 00:48:39,400
l have some news
which will revive your appetite.

660
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:40,880
Logar is dead?

661
00:48:41,120 --> 00:48:42,960
My funny daughter.

662
00:48:43,160 --> 00:48:45,240
You'll marry Vumar's son Timar.

663
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:46,880
Vumar's son Timar?

664
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:50,480
Yes, Timar. Moreover,
Vumar's son Timar.

665
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:53,920
Logar said that you two
were in love but...

666
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:57,160
l don't love Logar, nor any other
Goran man.

667
00:48:57,400 --> 00:48:59,320
l don't intend to marry.

668
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:12,640
We have a situation,
we have to meet immediately.

669
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:13,880
What happened?

670
00:49:14,120 --> 00:49:17,000
lt's very serious,
we should go to the big hall.

671
00:49:26,280 --> 00:49:30,840
lf it even comes close to our
planet, it could extinct life on Gora.

672
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:32,680
What's going on Superior Tocha?

673
00:49:32,920 --> 00:49:35,280
A big danger, Logar... A fireball.

674
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:39,720
A fire shaped ball
or a ball shaped fire, right?

675
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:42,640
We decided to use
the sacred stones.

676
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,800
Do you approve
as the military wing?

677
00:49:46,000 --> 00:49:49,480
ls there no other option? l think that
the stones should be the last resort.

678
00:49:49,680 --> 00:49:51,000
We have no choice.

679
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,600
lt's natural that l think different
cause l'm a soldier.

680
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:56,560
l know very well how to send that
fireball back to where it came from.

681
00:49:56,880 --> 00:50:01,760
We don't doubt your courage, Logar
but we have to try the sacred stones.

682
00:50:02,040 --> 00:50:03,600
You know better, sir.

683
00:50:04,640 --> 00:50:05,960
Bring the sacred stones.

684
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:07,560
So be it.

685
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:29,600
The manual is missing.

686
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:31,800
How does that feel, huh?

687
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:33,680
How come?

688
00:50:34,120 --> 00:50:36,320
l guess this is the end.

689
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,160
We're doomed.

690
00:50:38,600 --> 00:50:40,440
l want full authority, Superior Tocha.

691
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:43,000
-What can you do?
-''What can you do?''

692
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,280
Give me one hour.

693
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:47,920
Logar, lo...

694
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:53,480
What are we going to do?
Shall l get the ship ready?

695
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,280
Pull yourself together! Which ship?
Be smart, come.

696
00:51:00,760 --> 00:51:03,960
Are we going to sit and
watch the fireball get closer?

697
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,640
lt's such a pity that the manual
to the sacred stones is missing.

698
00:51:07,920 --> 00:51:10,160
Sure is, isn't it?

699
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:12,040
What are you doing, Logar?

700
00:51:12,320 --> 00:51:13,960
What do you think, you idiot?

701
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,840
Do you believe that my dad
sent that fireball?

702
00:51:17,400 --> 00:51:19,080
You are playing with fire.

703
00:51:19,320 --> 00:51:21,200
Don't play word games with me,
jackass!

704
00:51:21,480 --> 00:51:22,640
Jackass?

705
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:25,680
There's no other way to get attention
from that geezer Tocha and his girl.

706
00:51:25,920 --> 00:51:27,640
l've set it up like a clock...

707
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,480
-You see this?
-Yes.

708
00:51:30,680 --> 00:51:32,840
l'll stop the fireball with this.

709
00:51:33,080 --> 00:51:35,720
And that old fart is going to give his
daughter to me. And Gora.

710
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:37,720
You're amazing, Logar.

711
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:39,400
Am l?

712
00:51:41,040 --> 00:51:43,320
Notify that geezer
about our conditions immediately.

713
00:51:43,560 --> 00:51:44,480
Yes, sir.

714
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,440
We don't have much time.

715
00:51:46,760 --> 00:51:49,160
Logar, be careful with that shot.

716
00:51:49,360 --> 00:51:50,880
Am l being a handful?

717
00:52:02,680 --> 00:52:05,320
Ceku, l can't believe it's you!

718
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:07,640
Your prediction came true,
l'm getting married.

719
00:52:07,840 --> 00:52:08,880
What?

720
00:52:10,760 --> 00:52:12,040
With whom?

721
00:52:12,360 --> 00:52:16,040
Everything's messed up. A fireball
is approaching Gora, 216.

722
00:52:16,320 --> 00:52:18,880
This could be our last meeting.

723
00:52:19,080 --> 00:52:22,000
My father made a deal with
Logar, if he can stop the fireball...

724
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:26,840
...l'll have to marry him.
Either way l'm dead.

725
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,000
Don't talk nonsense!

726
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:31,640
-l miss you, 216.
-Me too.

727
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:33,360
Visiting hours are over.

728
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:34,840
Please, don't be sad.

729
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:36,320
Don't forget me, 216.

730
00:52:36,560 --> 00:52:37,960
Maybe he can't stop it.

731
00:52:38,560 --> 00:52:40,360
''Maybe he can't stop it''?!

732
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:45,600
Turn that off. What's this crap?

733
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,240
Come on, brother.

734
00:52:47,600 --> 00:52:50,000
-The guys are watching...
-Don't you feel no shame at all?

735
00:53:00,320 --> 00:53:03,080
Arif, Bob, you're all gonna die.

736
00:53:03,440 --> 00:53:05,520
We're not living anyway.
What happened?

737
00:53:05,720 --> 00:53:08,200
Turn on the TV. A big fireball
is approaching Gora..

738
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:10,680
The planet could go up in smoke
in one hour.

739
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,280
-Let it burn. lt's the Gorans' concern.
-We are on Gora, dude.

740
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:16,920
Yeah, right. Let's see what it is.

741
00:53:17,320 --> 00:53:20,360
The approaching fireball
is 10.000 vedon in diameter...

742
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:23,160
...and can wipe Gora off
the celestial map.

743
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:26,920
The Goran Administrative Council stated
that the manual of the sacred stones...

744
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,440
...is missing and therefore
Commander Logar's...

745
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:32,640
...destruction system
will be used.

746
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:34,320
This is The Fifth Element....

747
00:53:34,680 --> 00:53:36,440
Since the meteor shower
4000 years ago...

748
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:38,760
This is The Fifth Element.
Bruce Willis' movie.

749
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,960
There's this fireball
and he places the sacred stones...

750
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:43,720
That's it. Bruce Willis,
that short, bald fella...

751
00:53:45,080 --> 00:53:49,600
The leaders of Gora and Commander
Logar are in the Sacred Chamber.

752
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,400
Dear Gorans!
l'm Commander Logar!

753
00:53:52,800 --> 00:53:57,000
l'm always ready to sacrify my life
for Gora!

754
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,600
Due to a big misfortune
we can't use the sacred stones...

755
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:05,520
...but with this hyper optic vascular
freezer that my engineers prepared...

756
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:07,440
...l will save you
from this disaster...

757
00:54:07,640 --> 00:54:09,680
Bullshit. First of all
there's no such gadget...

758
00:54:09,880 --> 00:54:12,440
He just needs
to put the stones in their places.

759
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:14,000
Shut up Arif.

760
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:17,200
Hyper optic vascular freezer!

761
00:54:17,640 --> 00:54:18,800
What?

762
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:23,920
We are all very tense
and sad.

763
00:54:24,160 --> 00:54:28,520
Now l'll stop this damned fireball
and invite you all to my wedding.

764
00:54:32,600 --> 00:54:35,720
-Watch out for your heads.
-He's just boasting.

765
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:37,480
For Gora!

766
00:54:47,640 --> 00:54:49,240
Just shake it a little bit.

767
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:51,240
Logar, are you playing with us?

768
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,400
l'm doing the best l can, sir.

769
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,400
-Did you play with its batteries?
-Maybe it was left turned on?

770
00:54:56,760 --> 00:54:58,360
Come on, come on.

771
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:03,160
He's not going to stop it.
Robot, l have an idea.

772
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:05,080
Can you take me there?

773
00:55:05,320 --> 00:55:07,680
-Try the ventilation.
-l won't fall for that again!

774
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:09,720
Sacred Chamber.
Come with me.

775
00:55:15,360 --> 00:55:17,200
Don't panic, don't panic.

776
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:21,960
Shame on you!

777
00:55:22,160 --> 00:55:24,360
-Perhaps a part fell off?
-Which one?

778
00:55:24,560 --> 00:55:27,160
lf we turn it off and on again
it could get charged.

779
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:29,440
The fireball is coming, man!

780
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:32,000
So what?
Did my father send it?

781
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,800
-Take off your glasses.
-Here. So what?

782
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,200
-Commander Logar.
-Yes, dear.

783
00:55:37,440 --> 00:55:39,960
-An object is approaching, sir.
-Who are you?

784
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,120
Get out! Out! Please, go!

785
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:45,480
Get out of my way, shorty!

786
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:47,360
Greetings, chiefs!

787
00:55:47,560 --> 00:55:48,920
Who the hell are you?
Get him!

788
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:50,280
Logar!

789
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,960
Shut up, blockhead.
We know what you are.

790
00:55:53,160 --> 00:55:54,480
Do you want to
save your planet?

791
00:55:54,680 --> 00:55:55,640
Who are you?

792
00:55:55,840 --> 00:55:58,040
Whoopy Who.
What difference does that make?

793
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,760
Bring the sacred stones. l know
how to get rid of the fireball.

794
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,160
Are you an oracle?

795
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:05,040
What oracle, man... Captain,
tell that schmuck to shut up.

796
00:56:05,280 --> 00:56:06,400
lf he had some brain...

797
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:08,720
...he'd understood that those
stones symbolize the 4 elements.

798
00:56:09,000 --> 00:56:10,600
-Symbolize?
-Yeah, sure.

799
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,320
The 4 elements of nature.
Fire, water, earth, wood.

800
00:56:13,560 --> 00:56:14,640
Wood?

801
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,480
Why, are you offended?

802
00:56:16,880 --> 00:56:18,160
4 elements of nature...

803
00:56:18,360 --> 00:56:20,080
Fire, earth and water is easy...
Just get me some wood.

804
00:56:20,320 --> 00:56:21,360
Wasn't it air?

805
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,160
l said elements of nature.

806
00:56:23,360 --> 00:56:24,720
He could be right, sir.

807
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,400
This is a prisoner from Earth...

808
00:56:26,600 --> 00:56:28,280
Are you going to
trust him with Gora's future?

809
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:31,360
No, he'll trust you. Folks,
don't piss me off, bring the stones.

810
00:56:31,600 --> 00:56:33,160
Are you sure you can stop it?

811
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,040
Never mind that.
l have a condition.

812
00:56:35,280 --> 00:56:37,640
After l save the planet
you'll release me and my friends.

813
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,080
Deal!
Bring in the stones.

814
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,440
You brought this guy to Gora, right?

815
00:56:44,680 --> 00:56:46,400
Forget it, may be
he can't stop it.

816
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:48,600
''Can't stop it''?
What did l just say?

817
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:50,840
We're done for.

818
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:54,440
Yes, 4 elements of nature.

819
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,000
10 minutes to impact.

820
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:57,640
Don't tense me out here...!

821
00:56:57,880 --> 00:56:59,080
4 elements of nature...

822
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:02,160
Fire, water, earth, wood.
Now get me some wood.

823
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:05,920
Would this do the job?

824
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:12,120
Here we go.
Our first element.

825
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:13,760
Wood.

826
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,240
No, earth.

827
00:57:29,680 --> 00:57:32,200
Our second element, wood.

828
00:57:35,720 --> 00:57:37,480
Nope. Fire. Just a sec.

829
00:57:43,200 --> 00:57:45,640
And our 3. element... Wood.

830
00:57:53,280 --> 00:57:55,680
Listen, are you sure it's not air?

831
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,040
No, water. Just a minute!

832
00:57:58,280 --> 00:57:59,600
He spat on the sacred stone!

833
00:57:59,800 --> 00:58:01,920
What was l supposed to do,
dig for water?

834
00:58:02,320 --> 00:58:04,720
And our last element... wood!

835
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,080
No... lt's air.
Someone said just air!

836
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,800
lt's not wood.
Don't make up elements.

837
00:58:14,880 --> 00:58:15,960
Air.

838
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:28,160
Well, we've learned and saw
many elements.

839
00:58:28,440 --> 00:58:31,800
Now, the trickiest part. You'll
have do find me a girl.

840
00:58:32,040 --> 00:58:35,040
l'll kiss her in the middle of
4 elements and the fireball will stop.

841
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:36,760
For example this girl.

842
00:58:36,960 --> 00:58:38,360
What the hell
are you saying, you moron?

843
00:58:38,560 --> 00:58:41,160
The girl will come here!
Otherwise l'll turn off the elements!

844
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,760
Father!

845
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,720
Superior Tocha,
l won't allow this.

846
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:48,440
What's going through your mind Logar,
shall we all die?

847
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:50,280
Folks, the fireball!

848
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:54,440
Let her do it.
We'll take care of him later.

849
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:56,640
Come on or l'll turn it off.

850
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:20,600
Your name?

851
00:59:20,800 --> 00:59:21,680
Ceku.

852
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:23,920
l'm Arif. Are you from around here?

853
00:59:24,120 --> 00:59:25,200
Yes.

854
00:59:25,840 --> 00:59:27,960
Are you in school? Which year?

855
00:59:28,800 --> 00:59:30,880
Your dress is beautiful,
are you princess?

856
00:59:31,120 --> 00:59:32,160
Sort of.

857
00:59:32,720 --> 00:59:34,400
l have to kiss you.

858
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:36,720
l know.

859
00:59:36,920 --> 00:59:38,200
Shall l?

860
00:59:39,320 --> 00:59:40,720
One minute to impact.

861
00:59:40,920 --> 00:59:43,920
Just a minute. Actually...

862
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:46,880
Kissing a stranger,
l don't know but maybe...

863
00:59:47,360 --> 00:59:49,160
lt's strange but
you know, the fireball...

864
00:59:49,400 --> 00:59:50,800
Do you love your planet?

865
00:59:51,040 --> 00:59:52,040
Yes.

866
00:59:52,240 --> 00:59:55,960
l love my planet too.
l love it very much but...

867
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:01,240
10... 9... 8...

868
01:00:01,520 --> 01:00:03,760
7... 6... 5...

869
01:00:04,120 --> 01:00:07,760
4... 3... 2... 1...

870
01:00:29,760 --> 01:00:32,880
Enough of this nonsense!
Plackumates, arrest him.

871
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:35,360
What for?
l saved the planet.

872
01:00:36,320 --> 01:00:37,960
Don't believe this trash!

873
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,680
You think you're smart,
don't you earthling?

874
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:42,760
You want to take over Gora.

875
01:00:43,000 --> 01:00:44,800
Didn't we have a deal?

876
01:00:45,080 --> 01:00:48,720
This fool has cast dust in your eyes.
l have to consider Gora's security.

877
01:00:48,920 --> 01:00:50,600
l'll take interrogate later.
Take him away!

878
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:53,120
Some ailen you are.
You're breaking our bargain.

879
01:00:53,360 --> 01:00:56,720
Now that we got rid of the fireball
sent by that stupid Earthling...

880
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,680
...l'd like to invite you all to my
wedding. He didn't hurt you, did he?

881
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,160
Forget about the deal.
There will be no wedding.

882
01:01:07,360 --> 01:01:08,560
Really?

883
01:01:10,640 --> 01:01:13,680
Then l will put these photos
all around Gora City.

884
01:01:37,360 --> 01:01:39,040
Please, don't exaggerate.

885
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:40,920
Bravo, Arif! You saved us all.

886
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,440
Yeah, sure. You saw
how l was treated.

887
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,120
That was an awesome kiss
with the girl.

888
01:01:45,360 --> 01:01:47,360
Drop it Japanese.
Don't get on my nerves...

889
01:01:47,760 --> 01:01:50,200
l'm so sorry Arif.
lf l had known they would do this...

890
01:01:50,520 --> 01:01:52,640
-Where have you been?
-Ventilation.

891
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,240
You, Robot, except you
all of these guys are useless.

892
01:01:55,520 --> 01:01:57,160
You, and the girl.
Forget the rest.

893
01:01:57,360 --> 01:01:59,440
-Did you see how she looked at you?
-No. How did she look?

894
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,720
We've seen it all on TV,
she was really checking you out.

895
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:06,760
Shame on you. You should have zapped
when you saw us kissing.

896
01:02:06,960 --> 01:02:08,680
Give me a smoke.

897
01:02:13,720 --> 01:02:15,320
Are they marrying that girl
to that pinhead?

898
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:16,720
She doesn't want to.

899
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:19,240
Well, how could she?
This is weird.

900
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:22,200
That girl is alien
and that pimp too.

901
01:02:22,560 --> 01:02:27,360
Then they say that
aliens are evil. She's like an angel.

902
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:29,240
You know the line,
an alien says...

903
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,960
...''Hi Earthling, we are friends.''
lf that girl said this, it would be OK.

904
01:02:32,160 --> 01:02:34,440
But that fag... Look how
he makes me curse like sailor.

905
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,400
l shouted there. l was the one
who placed the stones...

906
01:02:37,600 --> 01:02:39,680
...but he puts on airs
as if he is the commander.

907
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:40,880
He is commander!

908
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:43,640
Could be, but first he needs to
be human. What's with those airs...

909
01:02:43,840 --> 01:02:46,720
And he says ''Take him away.''
l'm going to take him out for sure.

910
01:02:46,920 --> 01:02:49,960
No, pal... This is not alienity.
lt should come from inside.

911
01:02:50,160 --> 01:02:52,680
The other guy is an animal.
The girl is like an angel.

912
01:02:52,880 --> 01:02:54,120
Was this no goal either?

913
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,520
Did l miss again?

914
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:01,880
Was this no goal too?

915
01:03:02,080 --> 01:03:04,320
-Was this no goal?
-lt was!

916
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:15,200
l entrust myself to your
justice and humanity, your Honor.

917
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:22,160
Ceku, my child.

918
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:25,280
l'm in love, mom.

919
01:03:26,560 --> 01:03:28,120
With the earthling?

920
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:30,480
Was it that obvious?

921
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:34,920
Just like me.

922
01:03:35,280 --> 01:03:37,760
Look, mom. Arif is mine...
l fell in love with him first.

923
01:03:38,120 --> 01:03:40,720
l'm not talking about Arif, Ceku.

924
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,720
l happened to fall in love
with a non-Goran too.

925
01:03:43,960 --> 01:03:46,320
You loved someone
from another planet?

926
01:03:47,200 --> 01:03:52,320
Yes. l was even sure
that he was madly in love with me.

927
01:03:54,800 --> 01:03:57,760
l don't know how to put this.

928
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,160
-Your father is not Tocha.
-What?

929
01:04:02,360 --> 01:04:05,720
Tocha is not your real father.
Your father was very different.

930
01:04:06,800 --> 01:04:09,200
He stood out from the rest.

931
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,120
Papa!

932
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:19,560
lt's not me. Your father
is an earthling, Ceku.

933
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:20,640
What?

934
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:22,640
Rendroy is the only one
who knows our secret.

935
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,600
Your father has been a fugitive
outside Gora for years.

936
01:04:25,800 --> 01:04:29,600
He always wanted to take us
to Earth... but in vain.

937
01:04:30,680 --> 01:04:33,040
Tell me where my father is.

938
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:37,720
ln Negney. What are you doing?

939
01:04:38,080 --> 01:04:39,280
l'm going to my father.

940
01:04:39,560 --> 01:04:42,600
l would rather return to Earth with
my dad, than marry that lowlife Logar.

941
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,240
Negney is outside
Gora's defensive shield.

942
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:47,960
Ceku, you can't go alone.

943
01:04:48,520 --> 01:04:50,720
Then you will help me, Rendroy.

944
01:04:52,440 --> 01:04:54,960
Such a girl and when you
look at her from a distance...

945
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:58,320
...she's too tolerant to be an alien.
For instance, we kissed.

946
01:04:58,560 --> 01:05:01,000
-She didn't do anything...
- She was saving her planet, man.

947
01:05:01,360 --> 01:05:04,840
There was an
electricity between us!

948
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:07,320
Something happened.
Would she have kissed you?

949
01:05:07,640 --> 01:05:08,560
Of course.

950
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:12,120
Get out of here. l wouldn't kiss you
even if the Earth was in flames.

951
01:05:12,600 --> 01:05:14,640
What, are you pissed off?

952
01:05:15,280 --> 01:05:18,640
Arif lik, Arif lik,
You have a visitor.

953
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:21,640
The girl is here!
l swear this is the girl.

954
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,000
How do l look?

955
01:05:23,240 --> 01:05:24,520
Alright, stand up straight!

956
01:05:24,720 --> 01:05:27,320
Oh boy, l'm shaking.
Give me that rose. l'm off.

957
01:05:30,880 --> 01:05:31,600
Hi!

958
01:05:35,360 --> 01:05:37,920
Was it you, creature? What evil
are you planning for me this time?

959
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,800
First of all l'd like to
apologize as a Goran.

960
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:42,440
What's up?

961
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:45,160
Don't think l approve of
Logar's attitude.

962
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:47,160
You are a big hero, Arif.

963
01:05:47,400 --> 01:05:51,200
Take this pass-card,
it will get you out of here.

964
01:05:51,520 --> 01:05:54,240
lf this is another trick
l won't forgive you.

965
01:05:54,440 --> 01:05:56,480
Don't be ridiculous...
We don't have time...

966
01:05:56,760 --> 01:05:59,000
This card will take you
to the waste disposal unit.

967
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:01,960
You have to flee before
Logar takes care of you.

968
01:06:02,280 --> 01:06:07,120
Ceku, will wait for you outside. Take
care of her, don't leave her alone.

969
01:06:07,560 --> 01:06:10,080
Creature, you are the only
human among them.

970
01:06:10,280 --> 01:06:13,200
You are a decent lad, thanks.
l have a question...

971
01:06:13,520 --> 01:06:16,080
-What happened to your face?
-What's with my face?

972
01:06:16,280 --> 01:06:17,600
That's what l'm asking.

973
01:06:17,880 --> 01:06:19,760
My goodness,
there's something with it.

974
01:06:20,040 --> 01:06:21,520
Anyway, take care.

975
01:06:24,760 --> 01:06:25,600
Bye.

976
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:29,280
This dog will get
no bread nor water.

977
01:06:30,240 --> 01:06:32,360
lf Rendroy said this
you can trust him.

978
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:35,840
He's different from the rest,
indeed he's from Anarsha.

979
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,400
Arif, smarten up.
Which waste depot, which girl?

980
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:41,720
They are pulling your leg.

981
01:06:42,040 --> 01:06:44,480
But he says that
Rendroy is from Anarsha.

982
01:06:45,040 --> 01:06:48,960
The Anarshan never tell lies. And
they are the best at keeping secrets.

983
01:06:51,600 --> 01:06:55,640
Move on, everything's fine.
Look, l have the pass-card...

984
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,400
l'm out of here.
Who ever wants, can come too.

985
01:06:58,760 --> 01:06:59,880
l'm in.

986
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:04,120
l'll come with you to the exit.
Maybe l can be of help.

987
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:08,440
That's the spirit. Do your thing,
don't let the door zap us.

988
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:10,520
Come.

989
01:08:27,200 --> 01:08:29,040
The guy's at the door. What now?

990
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:31,560
Distract him, l'll come from behind.

991
01:08:31,800 --> 01:08:33,080
What kind of an idea is that?

992
01:08:33,320 --> 01:08:34,280
Let's go!

993
01:08:43,600 --> 01:08:46,440
-Hello there, sir.
-What are you doing here?

994
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,440
Come dear.
Hello, again.

995
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,160
Our friend is ill.
He has only 3 months to live.

996
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,280
We collect money for his operation
and we're selling these postcards.

997
01:09:03,160 --> 01:09:06,200
Everyone, from the cook,
up to the Superior bought one..

998
01:09:06,840 --> 01:09:11,160
-Pay whatever you like.
-What cards? Which superior?

999
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,040
This superior...

1000
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,560
Bastard. He puts us through an
interrogation for a small donation.

1001
01:09:16,880 --> 01:09:19,880
Open up. Would you like postcards?

1002
01:09:21,520 --> 01:09:23,440
-Let's go!
- So long, l'm not coming.

1003
01:09:23,800 --> 01:09:26,120
Bob, be smart...
we can go back to Earth.

1004
01:09:26,360 --> 01:09:28,800
Do you really think that you can
get to Earth?

1005
01:09:29,040 --> 01:09:33,840
Don't be shy...listen to the man.
Flee at once and find me.

1006
01:09:35,000 --> 01:09:36,080
Who's that?

1007
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,440
This is nothing alike
your science-fiction movies. Let's go.

1008
01:09:41,600 --> 01:09:44,480
He kept saying ''Come, come.''
His name is Garavel.

1009
01:09:44,720 --> 01:09:46,920
-Garavel?
-This is all in vain.

1010
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,000
So, would he appear in
a corona of light if it were in vain?

1011
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:51,640
We have to find the girl first.

1012
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:54,280
There's a girl, too.
You're making this too complicated.

1013
01:09:54,520 --> 01:09:57,240
Don't complain about everything.
You're spoiling the adventure.

1014
01:09:57,480 --> 01:10:00,120
-l don't like adventures.
-So, you don't like adventures?

1015
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:02,240
Let me give you
a brief insight then.

1016
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:04,000
You're writing scripts
for adult movies.

1017
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:07,520
You have a reggae bar in Kusadas.
You're in another galaxy, as prisoner.

1018
01:10:07,760 --> 01:10:09,080
You have robot friends.

1019
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,800
You get little pills as food.
And, you don't like adventure?

1020
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:13,800
Congratulations!

1021
01:10:14,040 --> 01:10:15,600
Why are you laughing?

1022
01:10:15,880 --> 01:10:18,760
Maybe he's programmed to laugh.
Give me 5. Let's go.

1023
01:10:22,720 --> 01:10:24,200
Come, this way.

1024
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:27,880
Oh no. The other way.

1025
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,520
So, you like adventure, huh?

1026
01:10:31,720 --> 01:10:34,440
Let's not argue, please.
l didn't go in because l got spooked.

1027
01:10:40,720 --> 01:10:42,520
216, Arif, l'm here.

1028
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:47,080
''216 and Arif!''
l have only devorative purposes.

1029
01:10:47,280 --> 01:10:49,000
Ceku, my dearest!

1030
01:10:51,640 --> 01:10:53,960
How are you...
Thanks for rescuing me.

1031
01:10:54,200 --> 01:10:56,880
-We'll talk about that later, let's go.
-Let's go then, honey!

1032
01:10:57,560 --> 01:11:01,520
And l'm Bob Marley Faruk,
nice to meet you. For crying out loud.

1033
01:11:02,680 --> 01:11:05,640
We'll exit here. The atmosphere
could burn your lungs.

1034
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,080
-Why should it?
-What do l know? Ask her.

1035
01:11:10,320 --> 01:11:11,440
Come on.

1036
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:15,480
-What's going on?
-You're against everything!

1037
01:11:16,280 --> 01:11:19,280
You go ahead.
They may look at your...

1038
01:11:21,280 --> 01:11:22,960
Why do you say such things?

1039
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:25,560
The atmosphere is beautiful.

1040
01:11:46,400 --> 01:11:50,120
-We made it!
-Yeah, right.

1041
01:11:51,240 --> 01:11:54,080
-l can almost see Taksim Square.
-Jeez!

1042
01:11:55,320 --> 01:11:57,200
There should be a bar around here.

1043
01:11:59,320 --> 01:12:01,280
Ceku, this is crazy.

1044
01:12:01,480 --> 01:12:03,120
Are we going to waste town?

1045
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,280
We have to find Chungo.

1046
01:12:34,320 --> 01:12:37,280
Come and get it.
Quality on the cheap.

1047
01:12:40,440 --> 01:12:43,040
Hold on a little.
The signal is breaking up.

1048
01:12:43,920 --> 01:12:46,680
Hello, Muhittin. Yes, dear.

1049
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:50,040

1051
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,480
Alright, sell it for 5000...
Yeah, sell it.

1052
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:00,240
Just a call
from work.

1053
01:13:00,520 --> 01:13:03,000
-Arif, let's buy this one.
-Okay, take it.

1054
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:05,480
-Changing room?
-At the back.

1055
01:13:07,240 --> 01:13:09,320
-He's happy.
-How much did you pay?

1056
01:13:09,560 --> 01:13:10,680
Not much.

1057
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:13,080
Hey, buddy. l have very smooth
second hand lightsabers.

1058
01:13:13,320 --> 01:13:15,840
-Come on, beat it.
-Sorry Faruk, didn't recognize you.

1059
01:13:16,320 --> 01:13:18,440
-Who was that?
-l don't know him..

1060
01:13:26,080 --> 01:13:27,360
What's up Bob?

1061
01:13:28,800 --> 01:13:31,280
Oh, Bob, how are you pops?

1062
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:36,920
Faruk,
are you staying for tonight girl?

1063
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,000
She must have mixed me up.

1064
01:13:40,320 --> 01:13:43,320
-So you never went out, huh?
-Okay, just a couple of times.

1065
01:13:44,480 --> 01:13:46,000
How can we find him?
What was his name?

1066
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,680
On Earth we would have
asked the barmen.

1067
01:13:50,360 --> 01:13:51,720
Shall l ask?

1068
01:13:52,000 --> 01:13:54,280
Don't even speak. They'll
tear you apart twice here.

1069
01:13:57,040 --> 01:13:58,400
There he is!

1070
01:13:58,840 --> 01:14:00,040
Garavel.

1071
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:02,800
Who's Garavel?

1072
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:09,040
-You told us to come, here we are.
-Who are you? Get lost.

1073
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,280
-Aren't you Garavel?
-No. Beat it!

1074
01:14:12,520 --> 01:14:15,240
-Garavel? We're looking for Chungo.
-Who's looking for Chungo?

1075
01:14:15,480 --> 01:14:19,360
-Rendroy...We're heading for Negney.
-l'm Chungo. Are you Ceku?

1076
01:14:20,520 --> 01:14:22,480
How could l've known,
they all have hoods.

1077
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,040
Let's get to business Chungo.
Rendroy sent us. We're off to Negney.

1078
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:28,480
You said 2 people.
Are you 4 now?

1079
01:14:28,760 --> 01:14:31,280
4 people. 3 adults
and one robot

1080
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,840
First the money.

1081
01:14:38,880 --> 01:14:40,280
Here you are.

1082
01:14:41,360 --> 01:14:44,440
That's dollars. lt's no good.
Buy yourself candy with it.

1083
01:14:44,880 --> 01:14:46,680
What else?

1084
01:14:47,120 --> 01:14:51,160
-Well, l have 20 million Turkish Lira.
-Turkish money is fine.

1085
01:14:52,520 --> 01:14:57,040
-l don't trust this guy.
-These? These are junk, man.

1086
01:14:58,560 --> 01:15:02,480
-Pal, is their nitrogen tank full?
-Nitrogen, my ass. Come.

1087
01:15:03,440 --> 01:15:05,120
What nitrogen?

1088
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,520
l'm using technical words so
he doesn't think we're gullible.

1089
01:15:08,760 --> 01:15:10,320
216, ride with me.

1090
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:13,520
l can't ride with you.
You drive like crazy. Arif

1091
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,160
Bob, did you ever use one of these?

1092
01:15:16,480 --> 01:15:19,760
l used to drive a taxi in lstanbul.

1093
01:15:20,000 --> 01:15:21,760
Well, take it easy!

1094
01:15:42,240 --> 01:15:43,920
We made it guys!

1095
01:15:44,800 --> 01:15:45,800
Sit down!

1096
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:53,840
Arif, listen to that fellow.
Robot says he's hungry.

1097
01:15:54,600 --> 01:15:56,640
You are some fox.

1098
01:15:57,240 --> 01:15:59,520
We'll stop by the Churo trees.

1099
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:09,040
Commander Logar,
the Plackumates are ready.

1100
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:10,360
Bring them on...

1101
01:16:13,760 --> 01:16:16,160
-So this is the summer outfit?
-Yes, Sir.

1102
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:21,600
Nice. Turn around. Attention... March!

1103
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,240
Bataillon, stop!

1104
01:16:33,080 --> 01:16:35,240
lsn't this too flashy, Kuna?

1105
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,920
-l think it's perfect for the summer.
-Alright.

1106
01:16:38,880 --> 01:16:40,480
-Commander Logar.
-Yes, dear?

1107
01:16:40,720 --> 01:16:42,480
3 prisoners escaped, sir.

1108
01:16:42,680 --> 01:16:43,960
Excuse me?

1109
01:16:44,560 --> 01:16:46,280
Colonel Zoran gave fugitive alert.

1110
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,440
Earthling Arif, 216
and one from the staff broke out.

1111
01:16:49,640 --> 01:16:50,800
What are you talking about?

1112
01:16:51,000 --> 01:16:52,880
Not me, she gave the report.

1113
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,800
Logar, where's my daughter?

1114
01:16:55,000 --> 01:16:56,360
What do you mean, Sir?

1115
01:16:56,560 --> 01:16:57,880
Ceku is missing!

1116
01:16:58,200 --> 01:16:59,840
-Kuna!
-Logar!

1117
01:17:26,840 --> 01:17:27,840
Give me that.

1118
01:17:30,160 --> 01:17:31,880
Clear the way.

1119
01:18:00,960 --> 01:18:04,080
You're going to burn,
you're going to die!

1120
01:18:04,280 --> 01:18:06,440
-Are you an oracle?
-Don't cause tension!

1121
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,120
Buddy, l've got very nice
second hand lightsabers.

1122
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:40,920
-Who am l?
-Commander Logar.

1123
01:18:41,160 --> 01:18:43,680
-Repeat.
-Commander Logar.

1124
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:49,640
Have you seen them around here?

1125
01:18:50,360 --> 01:18:51,720
Just like this?

1126
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:06,360
Commander Logar.

1127
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:11,600
Look here, Earth money.
Where did you find this? Speak.

1128
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,600
-Alright, stop. l'll tell everything.
-Shut up dog! Don't answer back.

1129
01:19:17,760 --> 01:19:19,440
What have you done?

1130
01:19:19,840 --> 01:19:23,400
Don't know. When things got tense
l got carried away a little.

1131
01:19:23,600 --> 01:19:26,280
-Take off your glasses.
-Yeah, so what? l lost my temper.

1132
01:19:26,480 --> 01:19:28,280
-Commander Logar.
-Yes, dear?

1133
01:19:28,520 --> 01:19:31,440
-An object is approaching, Sir.
-Who are you?

1134
01:19:31,680 --> 01:19:34,480
Get out! Out! Out.

1135
01:19:37,880 --> 01:19:40,840
Shoot everything that moves.
Burn this place down.

1136
01:19:41,520 --> 01:19:42,800
Burn it!

1137
01:20:00,720 --> 01:20:03,040
-Ceku, are you cold?
-A little.

1138
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,880
lf you're cold l could
set this whole place on fire.

1139
01:20:06,120 --> 01:20:07,600
Oh, Arif!

1140
01:20:10,640 --> 01:20:13,920
Robot, you don't know
what you're missing.

1141
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:16,840
That's some great garlic sausages.

1142
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:22,080
Look at the fruits of that tree.
Sausages.

1143
01:20:22,800 --> 01:20:26,080
We're out in space. Did nothing
else startle you?

1144
01:20:26,320 --> 01:20:28,520
Bob, what's inside that?

1145
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:32,040
Just plain meat.
lt sure is hot.

1146
01:20:32,280 --> 01:20:34,440
Yuck! You're eating meat?

1147
01:20:35,960 --> 01:20:39,520
l'm going to ask you something.
Where are we going now?

1148
01:20:39,840 --> 01:20:41,480
Bit by bit to Earth?

1149
01:20:41,760 --> 01:20:43,160
Ceku, shall l tell them?

1150
01:20:43,360 --> 01:20:46,000
Buddies, we will first find
Ceku's father.

1151
01:20:46,240 --> 01:20:50,240
Ceku's father is a fugitive from Earth
who lives in Negney. Are you surprised?

1152
01:20:52,760 --> 01:20:55,240
Was Superior Tocha
not you real father?

1153
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:57,560
My mother Mulu told me everything.

1154
01:20:57,760 --> 01:21:00,800
We'll find my father and flee from
this damned place. Are you with me?

1155
01:21:01,000 --> 01:21:02,360
l'm in.

1156
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:05,360
Oh my dearest.
How much you suffer.

1157
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:10,320
We have to find that beaming guy.
He'll settle everything.

1158
01:21:10,720 --> 01:21:12,560
We'll find him. We'll find
Ceku's father too.

1159
01:21:12,800 --> 01:21:17,080
You saved us from that prison, we'll
even find your primary school teacher.

1160
01:21:17,840 --> 01:21:20,080
l foretold you that
someone would help you out.

1161
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:23,360
-lt turned out to be true. Arif
-Bravo, Arif.

1162
01:21:25,480 --> 01:21:28,600
Who says there's no life
in space? Here!

1163
01:21:29,120 --> 01:21:31,120
Yeah, hit on her.

1164
01:21:31,480 --> 01:21:36,040
Can't l have a little romance here?
Take this. l'll take a leak.

1165
01:21:38,840 --> 01:21:40,600
There are no creatures
around here, right?

1166
01:21:43,520 --> 01:21:45,360
During introduction,
you ask for their sign.

1167
01:21:45,640 --> 01:21:48,840
Mine is Taurus. Or who's
your favourite philosopher?

1168
01:21:49,080 --> 01:21:53,400
Socrates. These kind of things. l could
have done this but l don't favor it.

1169
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,560
So strange.
You're in a different galaxy.

1170
01:21:56,760 --> 01:21:59,800
On a total foreign planet but you
don't seem to mind it.

1171
01:22:00,120 --> 01:22:05,080
That's philosophy. l'm in tourism, so
we work with foreigners all the time.

1172
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:07,920
l know foreign languages,
so l can socialize.

1173
01:22:08,200 --> 01:22:11,760
lf l stayed here for 3 month
l could learn...

1174
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,760
-Do you know English?
-English? No.

1175
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:17,680
English is a must.
How come you don't know?

1176
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:21,440
English, let me give you an example.
l love you is English.

1177
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:26,080
l love you. Don't get me wrong,
it's an example.

1178
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:31,640
lt means l love you. l means l...
love means you...

1179
01:22:31,880 --> 01:22:35,680
... and love means you.
But it's not that simple.

1180
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:38,160
There are different
conjugations in English.

1181
01:22:41,200 --> 01:22:42,600
So it's complicated.

1182
01:22:44,120 --> 01:22:46,400
Are you going back to Earth
when you find your dad?

1183
01:22:46,600 --> 01:22:49,280
l don't know. Can l
adapt to Earth?

1184
01:22:49,520 --> 01:22:51,600
Earth should adapt to you.

1185
01:22:51,880 --> 01:22:53,720
What's Earth,
just a planet.

1186
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:56,400
-Does it have satellites?
-Satellite?

1187
01:22:56,680 --> 01:22:58,920
The Earth. Yes, it has one.

1188
01:22:59,160 --> 01:23:03,600
lt's very beautiful, moonlight.
Romantic. You take your drink.

1189
01:23:03,960 --> 01:23:06,240
-So, Earth is beautiful.
-lt is.

1190
01:23:06,800 --> 01:23:10,160
-What about the Earthman?
-This is the difficult part.

1191
01:23:10,440 --> 01:23:11,760
But you'll tell the truth.

1192
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,000
Well, should l speak about myself
or about men from Earth?

1193
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,280
Do Earthmen differ that much?

1194
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,880
There's at least 5000
different type of people.

1195
01:23:20,160 --> 01:23:24,800
The Brad Pitt type,
you know, baby face.

1196
01:23:25,840 --> 01:23:29,240
And there are those like me, who are
appealing to women.

1197
01:23:29,800 --> 01:23:35,400
l'm different, really.
For a regular guy...

1198
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:40,520
...sex comes in first place,
for me second, even third.

1199
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:41,960
Really?

1200
01:23:42,160 --> 01:23:44,360
l don't know.
Maybe it's just me, l don't know.

1201
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:46,800
-You're so sweet.
-You too.

1202
01:23:47,040 --> 01:23:48,840
Now stop.
l don't want to brag.

1203
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:51,320
What about love? Do men
fall in love on Earth?

1204
01:23:51,560 --> 01:23:55,600
-They are loyal to their love.
-Do you have a lover?

1205
01:23:55,800 --> 01:24:01,560
No, not on Earth.
Nor on another planet.

1206
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:05,800
l'm in love with you Arif.

1207
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,560
l have feeling towards you too.
But let's first get to Earth.

1208
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,480
lt's not just me. There are
1000 different type of people.

1209
01:24:12,880 --> 01:24:14,520
Have a look.

1210
01:24:17,240 --> 01:24:20,000
-No, we had garlic sausages.
-What's that got to do with it?

1211
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:23,440
On Earth, when you eat
sausage you don't kiss...

1212
01:24:28,560 --> 01:24:30,040
Pardon.

1213
01:24:32,120 --> 01:24:34,560
Bob, can you come here a second?

1214
01:24:35,400 --> 01:24:38,520
Over here. Can you come
here for a second?

1215
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,400
-Bob, what do you think you're doing?
-What's going on?

1216
01:24:53,640 --> 01:24:55,200
You didn't let me
enjoy a little romance.

1217
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:57,760
-What did l do?
-Didn't you let one rip?

1218
01:24:57,960 --> 01:24:59,280
-Who, me?
-No, me.

1219
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,000
-There was only two of us.
-There's the girl and the robot.

1220
01:25:02,280 --> 01:25:04,640
-Did the girl fart then?
-Maybe it was the robot.

1221
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:08,240
-Bob, you're going to far.
-Maybe he's programmed to fart.

1222
01:25:08,560 --> 01:25:12,840
He brags that he's a fine robot.
lt must have been him.

1223
01:25:13,160 --> 01:25:16,720
We're on another planet and
besides, you're peeing on my foot..

1224
01:25:17,320 --> 01:25:19,280
Plackumates!
Arif, Bob! Run.

1225
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,320
Run!

1226
01:25:22,920 --> 01:25:24,120
They're shooting at us!

1227
01:25:34,360 --> 01:25:35,360
Arif!

1228
01:25:36,040 --> 01:25:37,680
Run towards the trees.

1229
01:26:01,040 --> 01:26:03,280
Where's Ceku? Where is she?

1230
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,120
To the waterfall!

1231
01:26:07,480 --> 01:26:09,320
-Where?
-Waterfall!

1232
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:26,080
Let me go!

1233
01:26:26,440 --> 01:26:31,080
Our defiant girl is back.
Who was rough to you.

1234
01:26:31,840 --> 01:26:33,480
Where are her accessories?

1235
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:35,760
They were killed in the Churo forest.

1236
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:38,520
What a lovely place to die.

1237
01:26:38,960 --> 01:26:41,000
Ceku, Ceku.

1238
01:26:42,040 --> 01:26:43,360
You're a dog!

1239
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:48,520
You ate sausages.

1240
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:49,920
Ceku, my daughter.

1241
01:26:50,240 --> 01:26:51,960
Mom, get me out of here.

1242
01:26:52,240 --> 01:26:55,320
Mulu, is the wedding dress ready?
You see, we're running out of time.

1243
01:26:55,640 --> 01:26:59,120
Your daughter used her adventure
bonus, l don't want any more games.

1244
01:27:01,040 --> 01:27:02,920
Don't look like that.

1245
01:27:03,280 --> 01:27:07,000
lf l hadn't farted
we all would be dead by now.

1246
01:27:09,640 --> 01:27:11,680
We have to find Garavel.

1247
01:27:12,040 --> 01:27:14,640
Would it be ok if he found you?

1248
01:27:18,160 --> 01:27:20,880
Hold on! You think everyone
with a hood is Garavel.

1249
01:27:21,080 --> 01:27:22,640
Will you allow me to make a test?

1250
01:27:28,920 --> 01:27:30,160
Damn...!

1251
01:27:30,880 --> 01:27:32,360
That's him! We're saved.

1252
01:27:32,680 --> 01:27:34,720
-Give me 5.
-We're saved!

1253
01:27:51,080 --> 01:27:54,680
My real name is Hursit
but they call me Garavel here.

1254
01:27:55,520 --> 01:27:57,680
He's a robot,
he doesn't drink. Thanks.

1255
01:27:57,960 --> 01:28:00,160
-A 211?
-Oh no, 216

1256
01:28:02,160 --> 01:28:04,160
Good upgrade.

1257
01:28:05,080 --> 01:28:06,280
Thanks.

1258
01:28:07,880 --> 01:28:10,680
-How long have you been here?
-lt's been 24 years.

1259
01:28:11,440 --> 01:28:13,600
You must have had a hard life.

1260
01:28:15,920 --> 01:28:17,040
Pardon!

1261
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:19,680
Drink your tea and rest.
We have plenty to do.

1262
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:23,800
l have to touch and sniff you
so that l can recognize you.

1263
01:28:24,480 --> 01:28:26,360
This guy's a serious case.

1264
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:30,160
-Why sniffing?
-l'm blind.

1265
01:28:32,680 --> 01:28:35,480
But a big trauma would
open your eyes, wouldn't it?

1266
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:40,040
What kind of a bullshit is that?

1267
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:47,240
You are very different from your movies.
ln Turkish movies it went like that.

1268
01:28:47,520 --> 01:28:50,400
10 years ago l lost my eyes
during an acid rain.

1269
01:28:50,640 --> 01:28:53,320
Now knock it off
and let me sniff you!

1270
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,960
You, come over here!

1271
01:29:00,880 --> 01:29:04,000
-Your name?
-Faruk, Bob Marley Faruk

1272
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:06,400
Okay, go. Now you!

1273
01:29:12,800 --> 01:29:14,280
216. Go!

1274
01:29:14,680 --> 01:29:18,320
-Do l smell too?
-l can smell everything. You!

1275
01:29:19,440 --> 01:29:21,960
Arif lik, all kinds of
carpet, kilim, travel.

1276
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,960
We've come a long way.
Don't let the smell mislead you.

1277
01:29:25,240 --> 01:29:26,880
Ok, l got what l wanted.

1278
01:29:28,080 --> 01:29:29,960
Now watch me.

1279
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:47,600
Bob, you're there.
Arif, there. 216, there.

1280
01:29:49,720 --> 01:29:53,160
-Correct?
-Yes, Master! Bravo!

1281
01:29:55,040 --> 01:29:57,840
-Can we talk for a sec?
-What?

1282
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,600
Mr Garavel, how long
have you been living here?

1283
01:30:00,880 --> 01:30:02,600
This guy's a nutcase.

1284
01:30:02,920 --> 01:30:05,240
And he's not blind at all,
he can definitely see.

1285
01:30:05,560 --> 01:30:07,560
Come on. Let go, for God's sake.

1286
01:30:07,840 --> 01:30:10,440
Ceku's picture. You're Ceku's
father. We found you.

1287
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:12,840
Give me that.

1288
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:16,880
Yes, this is Ceku.

1289
01:30:17,440 --> 01:30:19,480
But l'm not Ceku's father.

1290
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:25,640
Guys, please. l hope
l don't end up being her father...

1291
01:30:26,160 --> 01:30:28,200
Tell us who Ceku's father is.

1292
01:30:29,400 --> 01:30:31,080
Ceku's father is...

1293
01:30:42,240 --> 01:30:46,800
...Colonel Pilot Riza Kkdurmaz.
He's Ceku's father...

1294
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:50,200
ln 1979 we were together during a
reconnaissance flight.

1295
01:30:51,520 --> 01:30:54,640
We disappeared in a light beam
and came here.

1296
01:30:56,280 --> 01:31:02,080
Riza was rebellious and tempered.
He always had and escape plan.

1297
01:31:03,320 --> 01:31:06,840
-Just like l would do.
-My circuits are running wild.

1298
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:14,920
He always wanted to take his daughter
to Earth. Being a fugitive is hard.

1299
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,960
We managed to build a ship
but Riza was at the end of his days.

1300
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:24,200
-Don't tell me he's dead.
-He's dead man. Dead as meat.

1301
01:31:24,480 --> 01:31:26,400
My condolences.

1302
01:31:26,760 --> 01:31:31,360
lt was 2 years ago.
First l didn't know what to do.

1303
01:31:31,720 --> 01:31:34,680
l sent out signals to
Gora prisoner ships.

1304
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,640
Many times...Then l found you,
thanks to your mobile...

1305
01:31:37,880 --> 01:31:39,920
-You were talking to someone.
-Muhittin.

1306
01:31:40,200 --> 01:31:44,520
Whoever! l needed someone
who wanted to return to Earth.

1307
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:47,360
Finally l got your signal
and contacted you.

1308
01:31:47,680 --> 01:31:49,720
That's why you called me
'chosen one'.

1309
01:31:50,000 --> 01:31:54,280
Whatever!
l gave my friend my word.

1310
01:31:54,520 --> 01:31:57,520
Do you understand what this means?
l gave him my word!

1311
01:31:57,800 --> 01:32:00,080
Alright, l get it.

1312
01:32:00,560 --> 01:32:02,480
lt's too late for me.

1313
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:04,240
l won't make it.

1314
01:32:05,640 --> 01:32:07,760
Would you take Ceku to Earth?

1315
01:32:08,080 --> 01:32:11,320
Sure, man. l would go with her
to hell and back.

1316
01:32:12,240 --> 01:32:16,760
You didn't disappoint me Arif. How
about supper before we start training?

1317
01:32:17,360 --> 01:32:19,080
We have raki too.

1318
01:32:22,160 --> 01:32:24,280
l could drink a big bottle.

1319
01:32:24,480 --> 01:32:26,520
Cut it out, he's blind.

1320
01:32:27,520 --> 01:32:29,800
lf you don't settle for less,
you won't get more.

1321
01:32:30,040 --> 01:32:31,680
Did you pick this
by sniffing?

1322
01:32:31,920 --> 01:32:34,000
-Why, is it bad?
-Nope, but...

1323
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:35,720
Let me share it.

1324
01:32:38,280 --> 01:32:39,760
-Amazing.
-Yeah!

1325
01:32:40,040 --> 01:32:41,040
Bravo, Master.

1326
01:32:41,320 --> 01:32:44,640
Technique. Ambition.
Will power. Concentration.

1327
01:32:45,360 --> 01:32:47,040
This is technique, did you see that?

1328
01:32:47,880 --> 01:32:49,400
Robot...could you pass me that salt.

1329
01:32:49,760 --> 01:32:54,960
l have it.
Speed, balance, timing.

1330
01:32:57,520 --> 01:32:59,200
Cheers.

1331
01:33:05,320 --> 01:33:06,680
l'm here!

1332
01:33:07,920 --> 01:33:09,560
Yeah... but why?

1333
01:33:09,880 --> 01:33:11,360
Here we go!

1334
01:33:13,200 --> 01:33:15,280
l'm rebellious!

1335
01:33:15,560 --> 01:33:17,480
How do l get here in seconds?

1336
01:33:17,880 --> 01:33:21,320
Knowledge, experience.
Discipline.

1337
01:33:22,360 --> 01:33:25,240
-Arif, he's insane.
-Never mind. Bottoms up!

1338
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,720
Determination.
Desire. Ability.

1339
01:33:36,120 --> 01:33:38,560
Thanks for the food.
Now excuse me.

1340
01:33:38,800 --> 01:33:42,720
-Eating less, improves intelligence.
-l don't eat at all.

1341
01:33:43,040 --> 01:33:46,800
Who the hell are you?
Yeah, the robot. Ok.

1342
01:33:48,400 --> 01:33:51,120
Now excuse me Mr Garavel.
Good night.

1343
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:53,840
Did you see that?
They are afraid of me.

1344
01:33:54,120 --> 01:33:57,200
You stayed. Why?
Because you are the one!

1345
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:03,160
-Red or blue?
-What ''red or blue''?

1346
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:05,000
Don't try too fool me.
ls this not Matrix?

1347
01:34:05,320 --> 01:34:08,880
What mattress?
These are my blood pressure pills.

1348
01:34:10,720 --> 01:34:14,520
You're a strange guy Master Garavel.
How are we going to go back to Earth?

1349
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,760
We'll take out what's in you
and then stick it back in.

1350
01:34:18,120 --> 01:34:20,760
What's with these
word play?

1351
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:22,640
Arif, you're here.

1352
01:34:22,920 --> 01:34:24,600
Hey, a camera!

1353
01:34:24,880 --> 01:34:27,960
Just let me take a long shot,
as a memory.

1354
01:34:29,480 --> 01:34:31,760
l'll sniff it
and remember you.

1355
01:34:32,440 --> 01:34:34,920
l can only think of Ceku.
We're going to rescue her, right?

1356
01:34:35,160 --> 01:34:37,640
Don't worry,
we'll take care of it all.

1357
01:34:37,920 --> 01:34:41,000
Get some sleep now.
Tomorrow will be a hard day.

1358
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:45,400
That camera came in handy.
l don't have a single picture in space.

1359
01:34:45,640 --> 01:34:47,200
-Where are you?
-Here, here.

1360
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,160
Did you ever see Ceku
before today?

1361
01:34:49,400 --> 01:34:51,040
-No, l didn't.
-You didn't sniff her by chance?

1362
01:34:51,240 --> 01:34:53,840
-What's this crap?
-Fine then. This way.

1363
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:54,680
l can't believe they're dead.

1364
01:34:54,680 --> 01:34:56,400
l can't believe they're dead.

1365
01:34:56,400 --> 01:34:59,120
Arif told me that he was
loyal to his love.

1366
01:34:59,400 --> 01:35:01,920
l know, he'll come
and rescue me.

1367
01:35:02,160 --> 01:35:04,640
Don't take it so hard
on yourself.

1368
01:35:04,880 --> 01:35:08,480
Sometimes we have to
accept our faith.

1369
01:35:10,600 --> 01:35:14,400
On Earth the brides say:
''l cry but go anyway.''

1370
01:35:14,640 --> 01:35:16,000
How true it is.

1371
01:35:16,240 --> 01:35:17,640
Don't be so disgusting, Logar.

1372
01:35:17,880 --> 01:35:20,440
l came for the wedding gown fitting.
What's disgusting about that?

1373
01:35:20,680 --> 01:35:23,480
-Why are you doing this?
-Cause l'm a psychopath.

1374
01:35:26,920 --> 01:35:28,600
Please don't, Commander Logar!

1375
01:35:30,960 --> 01:35:32,840
This is a joke knife. Look.

1376
01:35:36,040 --> 01:35:40,320
But l have a real one if you want.
Enough with games, put it on.

1377
01:35:43,120 --> 01:35:46,320
This is the ship that will
take you to Earth.

1378
01:35:47,040 --> 01:35:48,640
KA-FA 1500

1379
01:35:48,880 --> 01:35:49,840
Yes.

1380
01:35:50,040 --> 01:35:53,720
-The turbines are not original.
-Get a shot of me with the ship.

1381
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:57,480
Master Garavel, are the papers
of the ship alright?

1382
01:35:57,760 --> 01:35:59,920
We have a long way ahead.
l wouldn't like any trouble.

1383
01:36:00,200 --> 01:36:02,800
Yes, everything's fine.
Did you ever fly a KA-FA 1500?

1384
01:36:03,120 --> 01:36:06,960
-To be honest... no.
-Come with me.

1385
01:36:12,920 --> 01:36:14,680
Look...how's that?

1386
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:16,120
Nice...What is it?

1387
01:36:16,480 --> 01:36:19,840
l built it...an upload system.
Don't ask me how it works.

1388
01:36:20,120 --> 01:36:24,480
lt takes 6 hours to explain. With this
l can make you a real space fighter.

1389
01:36:24,760 --> 01:36:26,760
-Sit.
-You swear?

1390
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:30,480
Let's see what we have.

1391
01:36:33,240 --> 01:36:35,160
KA-FA 1500...

1392
01:36:37,640 --> 01:36:40,600
Hold on... How about
a little action?

1393
01:36:40,840 --> 01:36:42,800
Let's load Kung-fu.

1394
01:36:43,080 --> 01:36:46,120
To me? Ok, do so.
What else do you have?

1395
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:52,680
Aikido, karate, Jiu-Jitsu, Highschool
Physics, Tao Sex, Best of Journey.

1396
01:36:53,200 --> 01:36:55,000
Have you got a sampler?

1397
01:36:55,800 --> 01:36:57,800
-Sure.
-Give me the sampler.

1398
01:37:05,120 --> 01:37:06,320
Tie him up.

1399
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:08,760
Man, this is a Commodore 64, right?

1400
01:37:09,080 --> 01:37:12,000
Bob, turn the camera off.
Don't waste the tape.

1401
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:21,040
Get the helmet.

1402
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,800
Good.

1403
01:37:30,000 --> 01:37:31,160
Good.

1404
01:37:35,200 --> 01:37:36,920
You won't feel any pain.

1405
01:37:37,160 --> 01:37:39,560
After the upload you'll be
a perfect warrior.

1406
01:37:39,840 --> 01:37:43,240
l've got nothing to do with war. Just
give me enough to rescue Ceku.

1407
01:37:43,440 --> 01:37:45,000
-Are you ready Arif?
-Yeah!

1408
01:37:52,920 --> 01:37:54,520
Here it comes!

1409
01:37:56,560 --> 01:37:58,400
Here it comes!

1410
01:38:17,480 --> 01:38:20,120
Ok, take it off.

1411
01:38:40,720 --> 01:38:43,040
The Force should be used
in the right place and time.

1412
01:38:43,680 --> 01:38:47,040
Don't forget, you should
never play with food.

1413
01:38:52,280 --> 01:38:56,200
l told you, it was a great upload.
His body has adapted to it.

1414
01:39:11,320 --> 01:39:13,120
Use your wrist.

1415
01:39:14,400 --> 01:39:16,960
Are you sure you're not
getting a free paint job here?

1416
01:39:17,400 --> 01:39:20,640
Don't forget, you can use
your powers for good as well.

1417
01:39:22,200 --> 01:39:24,000
How am l going to use
Karate for good?

1418
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:26,160
l'm going to knock
the shit out of them.

1419
01:39:26,480 --> 01:39:29,760
Nonsense! These exercises
will be fruitful later on.

1420
01:39:30,040 --> 01:39:32,120
Master Garavel,
these fruits are not ripe.

1421
01:39:32,440 --> 01:39:37,440
Gather them. You were unripe too,
now you're ripe. Come on.

1422
01:39:51,720 --> 01:39:53,520
Just run in circles around me, man!

1423
01:39:53,760 --> 01:39:56,000
l'm doing that.
What else should l do?

1424
01:39:59,760 --> 01:40:01,360
Turn that off.

1425
01:40:08,840 --> 01:40:10,800
You are some pinhead.

1426
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:14,880
When l bend back like this
run in a full circle around me.

1427
01:40:15,400 --> 01:40:17,760
l didn't understand that part
so l ran like this.

1428
01:40:18,000 --> 01:40:20,360
-A full circle. That's it.
-Bob holds it the wrong way.

1429
01:40:20,560 --> 01:40:23,520
-Turn it on again!
-What's going on here?

1430
01:40:24,880 --> 01:40:27,600
Stop playing!
We've got business!

1431
01:40:34,360 --> 01:40:35,920
Take your position!

1432
01:40:36,120 --> 01:40:36,920
Ready?

1433
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,040
1, 2, 3!

1434
01:40:41,280 --> 01:40:42,240
Odd or even!

1435
01:40:42,440 --> 01:40:43,560
Even!

1436
01:40:43,760 --> 01:40:45,280
Go on!

1437
01:40:45,480 --> 01:40:46,720
-Did we guess right?
-Yes, you did.

1438
01:40:46,920 --> 01:40:48,200
Give me five, Bob!

1439
01:40:48,480 --> 01:40:50,600
-Don't be a spoilsport.
-Why, man?

1440
01:40:54,120 --> 01:40:55,280
Sit down.

1441
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:05,600
Let's say, this is Ceku's room.

1442
01:41:05,840 --> 01:41:08,440
The nearest plackumat is at the
end of the corridor. What do we do?

1443
01:41:09,160 --> 01:41:11,800
A- Beat him up.

1444
01:41:12,320 --> 01:41:15,080
B- lgnore him.

1445
01:41:15,880 --> 01:41:17,800
C- We scram.

1446
01:41:18,080 --> 01:41:19,840
-Sir.
-Sir. Sir.

1447
01:41:20,600 --> 01:41:22,040
Yes, Faruk.

1448
01:41:22,640 --> 01:41:24,600
B- lgnore him.

1449
01:41:25,720 --> 01:41:27,360
A- We beat him up.

1450
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:28,680
Bravo, Arif!

1451
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:32,240
lf l had been uploaded that much
l would have known it too.

1452
01:41:32,480 --> 01:41:34,480
-You know the machine...
-Stop talking!

1453
01:41:36,360 --> 01:41:37,880
Robot, do you have the plans?

1454
01:41:38,080 --> 01:41:39,760
-Yes, sir
-Good.

1455
01:41:40,000 --> 01:41:43,480
When you arrive at Gora go directly
to her room. No adventures!

1456
01:41:43,720 --> 01:41:47,000
Would we get extra credit if we give
that pimp with the cap a good beating?

1457
01:41:47,920 --> 01:41:49,960
What extra credit?

1458
01:41:52,080 --> 01:41:56,000
Ok, you can leave now.
Arif, continue with your exercises.

1459
01:41:56,960 --> 01:41:58,960
-Let's go, Robot.
-Have a nice day, sir.

1460
01:42:12,120 --> 01:42:15,960
Bravo! Ceku will love
you much more like this.

1461
01:42:16,200 --> 01:42:18,800
l don't intend to boast.
As soon as we're back on Earth...

1462
01:42:19,080 --> 01:42:22,360
-...l'll get it all deleted.
-Do you think it will be easy?

1463
01:42:22,640 --> 01:42:25,360
-What?
-Rescuing Ceku from Gora.

1464
01:42:25,680 --> 01:42:27,600
Don't worry. Just give me
that goddamn tool.

1465
01:42:35,600 --> 01:42:36,560
Step aside!

1466
01:42:39,800 --> 01:42:42,440
Mr Garavel, Arif and
Bob are calling you.

1467
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,120
-Alright.
-Good.

1468
01:42:46,880 --> 01:42:49,240
Dude, l can't move in these tights.

1469
01:42:49,480 --> 01:42:52,800
lt looks good on you. Your shoulders
are in the open. Leave it like this.

1470
01:42:53,040 --> 01:42:55,840
Master Garavel, how's this
outfit for the raid?

1471
01:42:59,000 --> 01:43:01,680
The outfit is very important
for a superhero, Arif.

1472
01:43:01,920 --> 01:43:05,520
-But this is a little...
-l think it's too sexy.

1473
01:43:05,720 --> 01:43:07,240
Sexy. Go, change.

1474
01:43:08,080 --> 01:43:09,320
How's this?

1475
01:43:11,480 --> 01:43:12,520
Well...

1476
01:43:12,720 --> 01:43:14,000
Nope. Next.

1477
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:15,600
And this?

1478
01:43:16,520 --> 01:43:19,680
-The helmet doesn't look good.
-The helmet is no good they say. Next.

1479
01:43:20,120 --> 01:43:23,080
ls this too
gentlemanlike?

1480
01:43:24,280 --> 01:43:25,760
A little classic.

1481
01:43:26,000 --> 01:43:27,200
Too classic. Next.

1482
01:43:29,000 --> 01:43:30,120
Next!

1483
01:43:30,960 --> 01:43:32,400
Because of this?

1484
01:43:33,240 --> 01:43:34,640
How's this one?

1485
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,280
Super.

1486
01:43:36,840 --> 01:43:37,800
Good.

1487
01:43:37,800 --> 01:43:40,520
Good.

1488
01:43:40,520 --> 01:43:45,440
Now go my boys!
Go and bring Ceku!

1489
01:43:46,160 --> 01:43:49,920
Thanks for everything Master Garavel.
We'll be here with Ceku in 12 minutes.

1490
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:59,120
Good, you're quick. Have
a nice journey. Come back quick.

1491
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:00,480
Let's go!

1492
01:44:02,440 --> 01:44:04,400
Good luck!

1493
01:44:47,680 --> 01:44:50,320
Bob, are you ready to shoot
the sci-fi of your life?

1494
01:44:50,600 --> 01:44:51,880
Start recording.

1495
01:44:53,800 --> 01:44:54,840
Let's go!

1496
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,240
Bob, be careful with the camera.
Or else Mr Garavel will kill us!

1497
01:44:58,480 --> 01:44:59,920
Move on!

1498
01:45:11,640 --> 01:45:13,320
Let me shoot you.

1499
01:45:17,160 --> 01:45:18,640
This is great.

1500
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,520
-You again?
-Oh my!

1501
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:55,680
Why ''Oh my''?
ls this guy ''Oh my''?

1502
01:46:05,280 --> 01:46:07,640
-Bravo Arif
-Ceku's room.

1503
01:46:08,000 --> 01:46:09,280
Ventilation.

1504
01:46:11,560 --> 01:46:13,600
Come on. Shoot everything.

1505
01:46:15,480 --> 01:46:17,720
Great! This color really becomes you.

1506
01:46:18,080 --> 01:46:19,640
l'll make you one too.

1507
01:46:21,680 --> 01:46:23,880
Be careful! Are you going to
stitch it on me?

1508
01:46:24,120 --> 01:46:27,320
Commander Logar, alarm in D corridor.
3 of our men are missing.

1509
01:46:27,680 --> 01:46:30,000
Why do you bother me
with that, you idiot?

1510
01:46:30,240 --> 01:46:33,360
l don't want to pay attention
to anything but my wedding suit.

1511
01:46:33,640 --> 01:46:34,680
l said careful.

1512
01:46:34,960 --> 01:46:37,600
Look Kuna, l don't want trouble
in the last minute. Soldier, get out!

1513
01:46:37,840 --> 01:46:42,800
l said out! l'm sick, l'm psycho, ok?
Get out!

1514
01:46:43,440 --> 01:46:45,280
Get out! Out!

1515
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:51,040
-Commander Logar.
-Yes, dear?

1516
01:46:51,280 --> 01:46:53,080
An object is approaching, Sir.

1517
01:46:56,200 --> 01:47:00,720
Out! Get out, all of you!
Get out!

1518
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:03,840
Come closer, come.
Sit down.

1519
01:47:10,520 --> 01:47:11,840
Take off your glasses.

1520
01:47:16,000 --> 01:47:18,400
-What's your name?
-Tihulu.

1521
01:47:26,800 --> 01:47:30,520
Why do you constantly say
''An object is approaching?''

1522
01:47:30,840 --> 01:47:32,640
Are you an oracle?

1523
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,400
Why are you doing this?

1524
01:47:41,280 --> 01:47:42,920
Who are you?

1525
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:47,760
Let me have it. l want to
shoot a little too.

1526
01:47:48,040 --> 01:47:51,800
Hold on. Something very
weird is going on here.

1527
01:47:53,960 --> 01:47:55,360
What is it, man?

1528
01:47:55,760 --> 01:47:59,240
Oh boy, Logar. You're
having a wedding, right?

1529
01:47:59,920 --> 01:48:03,080
You'll get a perfect
wedding gift from me!

1530
01:48:03,480 --> 01:48:04,760
l can't believe my eyes!

1531
01:48:05,080 --> 01:48:06,800
l didn't know that
you were so nervous.

1532
01:48:07,000 --> 01:48:09,160
l am.
You can ask Kuna.

1533
01:48:09,360 --> 01:48:11,080
He is very nervous.

1534
01:48:11,320 --> 01:48:12,760
-Commander Logar!
-Yes, dear?

1535
01:48:12,960 --> 01:48:15,200
Are you really going to
make me Patrol Chief?

1536
01:48:15,400 --> 01:48:17,240
Yes. l'm going to make all of you.

1537
01:48:17,480 --> 01:48:19,200
What's going on there?

1538
01:48:19,480 --> 01:48:23,760
Bob, your film took a weird turn.
lt's not sci-fi anymore.

1539
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:54,920
Again 'oh my'!

1540
01:48:55,880 --> 01:48:58,720
You, dude in black!
Come here.

1541
01:49:00,080 --> 01:49:03,000
Come, keep coming like that!

1542
01:49:03,280 --> 01:49:04,800
Did l use my fists
on the other one?

1543
01:49:05,000 --> 01:49:06,720
-Yes, your fists.
-Then you'll get a kick.

1544
01:49:17,560 --> 01:49:20,720
-Arif, Ceku is not here!
-What do you mean?

1545
01:49:21,720 --> 01:49:24,600
Oh, my carpet! Take it with you.
l've got nothing to give away.

1546
01:49:27,680 --> 01:49:28,800
Oh, shit!

1547
01:49:29,240 --> 01:49:30,760
Arif? Guys?

1548
01:49:31,040 --> 01:49:32,080
Where's Ceku?

1549
01:49:32,280 --> 01:49:34,520
-She thinks you're dead.
-l swear we're not.

1550
01:49:34,720 --> 01:49:36,760
-They are in the ball room.
-l know the way.

1551
01:49:36,960 --> 01:49:39,720
-Ventilation.
-Oh man, what a ventilation.

1552
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:05,160
-This is the ballroom.
-Good.

1553
01:50:16,680 --> 01:50:18,600
The bride's relatives are here as well.

1554
01:50:18,840 --> 01:50:20,680
Are your power shields up?

1555
01:50:25,800 --> 01:50:27,960
Beautiful.
Out, out, out!

1556
01:50:28,320 --> 01:50:29,760
Dear Gorans...

1557
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:32,720
Commander Logar Trihis...

1558
01:50:33,360 --> 01:50:35,920
...and his future wife
Ceku Lamtschina.

1559
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:49,040
Throw the bouquet.

1560
01:50:53,600 --> 01:50:59,240
Dear Gorans. Commander Logar
will give us a little harp concert.

1561
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:01,760
Commander Logar Trihis!

1562
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:10,440
Make it big,
so that everyone can see.

1563
01:51:10,720 --> 01:51:11,960
Arif, be careful!

1564
01:51:16,600 --> 01:51:19,040
-My composition is called ''You're mine''.
-Applause!

1565
01:51:27,640 --> 01:51:29,760
-What was l going to play?
-''You're mine''.

1566
01:51:56,440 --> 01:51:57,960
Applause!

1567
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,000
Shall l do an encore?
Shall l?

1568
01:52:14,560 --> 01:52:17,360
Greetings! ls this dude
having his circumcision ceremony?

1569
01:52:17,680 --> 01:52:19,400
-Arif!
-Ceku, honey.

1570
01:52:20,000 --> 01:52:21,440
Plackumates, arrest him!

1571
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:23,840
OK. Excuse me, honey.
Come over!

1572
01:52:26,200 --> 01:52:27,240
Come, come!

1573
01:52:42,200 --> 01:52:45,320
Logar, you idiot!
l'm at the limit of heroism...

1574
01:52:45,600 --> 01:52:48,160
...that's possible
in these kind of movies.

1575
01:52:48,400 --> 01:52:50,640
Don't cause unnecessary trouble
and don't make me beat you.

1576
01:52:50,880 --> 01:52:52,080
l'll take Ceku and leave.

1577
01:52:52,440 --> 01:52:53,920
You moron! How dare you
ruin my wedding?

1578
01:52:54,200 --> 01:52:55,360
Don't enrage me, dude!

1579
01:52:55,680 --> 01:52:58,240
Dear Gorans, l'll show you
his real face.

1580
01:52:58,560 --> 01:53:00,160
Bob! 216!

1581
01:53:07,760 --> 01:53:10,320
Bob, go forward, man! What's this?

1582
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,160
60 % of the Gorans are idiots.

1583
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:20,480
Tocha too. A little blackmail with
photomontage, and he obeyed.

1584
01:53:21,600 --> 01:53:25,320
When l'm the Superior l'll get rid
of them all! The council too.

1585
01:53:25,800 --> 01:53:28,600
l sent a fireball
and they all chickened out.

1586
01:53:28,920 --> 01:53:30,600
-Did you send that fireball?
-No, my father.

1587
01:53:31,320 --> 01:53:32,440
This is montage!

1588
01:53:33,120 --> 01:53:35,320
Yeah, we saw you mounting.

1589
01:53:35,640 --> 01:53:37,120
Plackumates, arrest him!

1590
01:53:38,600 --> 01:53:40,920
We'll burn down the planet!

1591
01:53:41,600 --> 01:53:43,480
You scum!

1592
01:53:49,640 --> 01:53:51,080
Thanks, pal.

1593
01:54:00,760 --> 01:54:05,000
Commander Logar, l'm detaining you
with charges of treason against Gora.

1594
01:54:05,440 --> 01:54:07,080
That's not detain,
it's entertain.

1595
01:54:08,240 --> 01:54:10,960
-Logar, what are you doing?
-What do you think?

1596
01:54:14,720 --> 01:54:17,400
-l always wanted to do this.
-Bravo, Bob!

1597
01:54:17,680 --> 01:54:20,440
Get them out of here.
They'll stand trial.

1598
01:54:21,760 --> 01:54:23,920
You are a great man, Earthling.

1599
01:54:24,240 --> 01:54:27,360
You saved us again
from a big disaster.

1600
01:54:27,880 --> 01:54:30,040
On behalf of all Gorans
l'd like to thank you.

1601
01:54:30,280 --> 01:54:31,720
Don't mention it,
Superior Tocha.

1602
01:54:32,000 --> 01:54:34,080
We did learn a lot from you,
my friend!

1603
01:54:34,280 --> 01:54:35,840
So did l.

1604
01:54:36,040 --> 01:54:38,400
l learnt to look at life
from a different angle.

1605
01:54:38,600 --> 01:54:40,640
l starved, was pushed
and held captive.

1606
01:54:40,880 --> 01:54:43,680
But l didn't give up. l was
oppressed because l was from Earth.

1607
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:46,920
l found struggle,
l found love, romance.

1608
01:54:47,520 --> 01:54:51,800
Look how similar we are and
how we all strive for love, right?

1609
01:54:52,160 --> 01:54:54,360
Hollywood, this goes to you.

1610
01:54:54,680 --> 01:54:57,400
For decades you've
mispresented the aliens to us.

1611
01:54:57,760 --> 01:55:02,520
But don't forget, a human is a human
even if he's an alien.

1612
01:55:02,800 --> 01:55:04,720
-Mother Mulu, may l?
-Speak out Arif.

1613
01:55:05,000 --> 01:55:06,840
Superior Tocha...
Ceku and l are in love.

1614
01:55:07,160 --> 01:55:10,640
We will return to Earth and
build there a new world.

1615
01:55:10,920 --> 01:55:12,880
A new world within that world.

1616
01:55:13,120 --> 01:55:14,360
As you wish.

1617
01:55:15,440 --> 01:55:17,120
Shall l get a ship prepared?

1618
01:55:17,400 --> 01:55:19,720
We have one, don't worry.
Bob, 216.

1619
01:55:20,440 --> 01:55:23,400
We'd like to give you the key to Gora.

1620
01:55:24,000 --> 01:55:26,520
-ls it made of gold?
-Yes.

1621
01:55:27,240 --> 01:55:30,320
-Stop!
-Who are you, basketball player?

1622
01:55:30,560 --> 01:55:32,360
-Give me that tape!
-Which tape, man?

1623
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,400
Give it to me!

1624
01:55:34,640 --> 01:55:37,120
That tape is the only proof
of our space adventure.

1625
01:55:37,360 --> 01:55:39,800
-l have a family. Now, give it.
-What are you saying, fireball?

1626
01:55:42,240 --> 01:55:45,360
-Run, if you're smart.
-Let him go Arif. He's just a kid.

1627
01:55:45,600 --> 01:55:49,480
-Kid? He has a beard,
-Our love is proof enough.

1628
01:55:49,720 --> 01:55:50,840
My love!

1629
01:56:00,440 --> 01:56:02,800
When you pass the heat
during atmosphere entry...

1630
01:56:03,000 --> 01:56:04,440
...everything is okay.

1631
01:56:04,720 --> 01:56:07,040
-l put the carpet into the ship.
-Great. Thanks!

1632
01:56:07,240 --> 01:56:09,680
Guys, the ship is only for two.
So, excuse us, ok?

1633
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:13,640
Tocha is our friend now. We can come
and go whenever we want.

1634
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:17,320
Respect! You're
just as cool as Bob Marley.

1635
01:56:19,360 --> 01:56:22,720
Don't worry. You won't regret it.

1636
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:25,840
Here, this is for you.

1637
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:27,640
What's this?

1638
01:56:27,920 --> 01:56:29,880
Your dad's belongings.

1639
01:56:31,160 --> 01:56:33,000
Thank you, Gravel.

1640
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:36,600
You can't find this kind of friendship
even on Earth. Robot.

1641
01:56:37,120 --> 01:56:41,880
-Arif, l'll never forget you.
-You are really a robot man!

1642
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:47,840
Master Garavel!

1643
01:56:48,080 --> 01:56:50,000
Give us your blessing.
You've helped us a lot.

1644
01:56:50,240 --> 01:56:51,840
You have my blessing!

1645
01:56:53,960 --> 01:56:55,560
-No way!
-Bravo!

1646
01:56:55,760 --> 01:56:57,040
lt's education, pops.

1647
01:56:57,280 --> 01:57:00,000
-What's this?
-A camera. Does it have film?

1648
01:57:00,400 --> 01:57:01,400
l don't know.

1649
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,960
There is. Go over there.

1650
01:57:11,000 --> 01:57:12,600
We're very lucky!

1651
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,600
Say cheese!

1652
01:57:17,720 --> 01:57:21,280
No, this is no good either.
lt is fake.

1653
01:57:21,520 --> 01:57:24,360
-Hake?
-Fake. lt's phony.

1654
01:57:26,120 --> 01:57:27,880
l'd like to ask a question.

1655
01:57:28,160 --> 01:57:32,240
You either don't take this serious
or you're playing with me.

1656
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:35,520
This space thing
is nothing like this.

1657
01:57:36,880 --> 01:57:38,800
Cut the crap, look.

1658
01:57:39,400 --> 01:57:43,400
This is me, this is Ceku,
this 216, the robot. Look!

1659
01:57:43,920 --> 01:57:46,520
This is Bob Marley Faruk
and this is Master Garavel.

1660
01:57:46,800 --> 01:57:48,480
This photo was taken on Gora.

1661
01:57:48,680 --> 01:57:52,440
500.000$ minimum. 500.000$,
here you see the ship.

1662
01:57:52,760 --> 01:57:55,520
KA-FA 1500. Don't tell me
about the ship l came back with.

1663
01:57:55,760 --> 01:57:57,600
With the Goran girl!

1664
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:00,080
Goran?

1665
01:58:02,640 --> 01:58:03,960
Nutcase!

1666
01:58:06,560 --> 01:58:10,960
Asim, l want a lemonade
and two Goran toast.

1667
01:58:11,400 --> 01:58:13,600
Do you want something, buddy?

1668
01:58:17,240 --> 01:58:19,480
You'll never understand this.

1669
01:58:20,800 --> 01:58:22,600
l'm not touching you this time.

1670
01:58:26,080 --> 01:58:27,720
Pearls before swine.

1671
01:58:30,520 --> 01:58:32,520
-What happened?
-They moved.

1672
01:58:32,760 --> 01:58:34,520
-Who?
-My 'hala'.

1673
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:37,520
l wanted you to meet them
while you were here.

1674
01:58:37,720 --> 01:58:41,600
-What's 'hala'?
-Hala and her family, relatives.

1675
01:58:41,840 --> 01:58:44,800
Hala means the sister of the father.
l'll teach you all these.

1676
01:58:45,080 --> 01:58:47,880
Teyze is the sister of the mother.
Grmce, elti... Something like Rendroy.

1677
01:58:50,080 --> 01:58:51,240
What's wrong?

1678
01:58:51,480 --> 01:58:54,720
Arif, do you think
that l can adapt to the Earth?

1679
01:58:55,080 --> 01:58:58,120
Of course. Just get over with this
galactic tension.

1680
01:58:58,360 --> 01:59:01,400
lt's only a planet.
Adapt to it!

1681
01:59:01,800 --> 01:59:03,920
-Shall l go with light speed?
-Yeah, sure.

1682
01:59:07,440 --> 01:59:08,960
Oh boy!
