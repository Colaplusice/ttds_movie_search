1
00:01:41,344 --> 00:01:43,193
Dad...

2
00:01:47,331 --> 00:01:49,880
Maybe it's the wind

3
00:01:59,004 --> 00:02:00,663
No!

4
00:02:03,542 --> 00:02:07,439
Stop! Please! Stop!

5
00:02:13,347 --> 00:02:17,390
You have a week, Evans. Then we'll burn the house.

6
00:02:19,909 --> 00:02:21,968
William

7
00:02:33,111 --> 00:02:35,080
William!

8
00:02:42,386 --> 00:02:44,965
God damn it, William!

9
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:50,422
God damn it! Put that down!

10
00:02:50,932 --> 00:02:52,501
Let go!

11
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:58,499
It's the last feed we've got

12
00:03:16,977 --> 00:03:19,286
I'll take care of this

13
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,879
No, you won't

14
00:03:56,032 --> 00:04:01,030
Herd's over the ridge by now.
You go get cleaned up.

15
00:04:11,154 --> 00:04:13,643
You lied to me, Dan

16
00:04:15,851 --> 00:04:18,510
You told me we made payments to Hollander.
- We did

17
00:04:18,550 --> 00:04:26,755
So, how do you think we bought feed, Alice.
Three months water, the medicine for Mark...

18
00:04:27,495 --> 00:04:30,894
I had a choice between our family and paying them down

19
00:04:31,293 --> 00:04:33,717
We're supposed to make decisions together

20
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:36,216
Would you have made anything different?

21
00:04:39,615 --> 00:04:46,501
Alice, we can't make it rain together
Turn the dust into grass

22
00:04:46,890 --> 00:04:50,628
We can't stop Hollander from selling
our land to the railroad either

23
00:04:53,836 --> 00:05:01,432
It's too bad the doctors at the aid station didn't take much of my leg.
I read that the pension act pays by the pound now

24
00:05:03,831 --> 00:05:06,330
Stop looking at me like that

25
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:08,749
Are you going to tell the Marshal what those men did?

26
00:05:08,779 --> 00:05:11,757
Marshal ain't doing shit
-William.

27
00:05:11,777 --> 00:05:17,724
First thing, Mark. I'm going to take you boys.
We're going to round up the herd.
Then I'm going into town

28
00:05:17,764 --> 00:05:19,223
What are you going to do there?

29
00:05:19,253 --> 00:05:21,662
I'm going to tell Hollander to make this right

30
00:05:22,292 --> 00:05:26,389
I'm going to tell him to pay for a new barn.

31
00:05:27,198 --> 00:05:30,247
Maybe we should just shoot him like Will says.

32
00:05:57,907 --> 00:06:01,524
Coach is headed for Bigsby, Boss

33
00:06:02,094 --> 00:06:07,800
Girded with iron, (?) on top, double shotguns.
And a Gatling

34
00:06:55,371 --> 00:06:58,958
You should have let me save the feed

35
00:07:03,257 --> 00:07:05,186
Ar you going to hock that?

36
00:07:05,685 --> 00:07:07,674
Some day, William, ...

37
00:07:08,283 --> 00:07:11,342
... when you walk in my shoes you might understand.

38
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:14,091
I ain't never walking in your shoes.

39
00:07:14,161 --> 00:07:15,949
Tracks over here.

40
00:08:30,065 --> 00:08:32,274
Here we go.

41
00:08:32,314 --> 00:08:34,803
Giddy up!!

42
00:09:42,871 --> 00:09:44,921
Go man the Gatling

43
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:04,029
Mark, stay here

44
00:10:23,204 --> 00:10:24,803
Down !!

45
00:10:46,111 --> 00:10:48,790
I think they will not follow us anymore.
[They're not going to (?) in a (?)]

46
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,803
Pull up! Pull up!

47
00:11:58,078 --> 00:12:00,867
Good morning, Pinkerton

48
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:06,214
Name's Charlie Prince,
I expect you've heard of me.

49
00:12:08,712 --> 00:12:14,550
Well, I heard about a
balled up whore named Charlie Princess.

50
00:12:15,658 --> 00:12:17,857
Is that you, missy?

51
00:12:22,515 --> 00:12:25,083
I hate Pinkertons

52
00:12:25,133 --> 00:12:27,322
Byron McElroy

53
00:12:27,362 --> 00:12:30,851
When did your hair turn gray, Byron?

54
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:34,184
Go to hell, Ben Wade.

55
00:12:37,503 --> 00:12:42,090
Well, will you look at all this.
You all spared no expense this time, Byron

56
00:12:42,969 --> 00:12:48,457
I've got to say, thought.
It's probably cheaper just to let me rob the damn thing

57
00:12:52,764 --> 00:12:57,252
If you are going to kill me,
just as soon get to it

58
00:12:58,970 --> 00:13:01,379
I ain't going to kill you

59
00:13:01,409 --> 00:13:03,498
Not like this

60
00:13:05,207 --> 00:13:08,236
It won't change a thing,
if you let me live

61
00:13:09,915 --> 00:13:12,614
I'll come for you.

62
00:13:13,224 --> 00:13:15,752
I'd be disappointed if you didn't

63
00:13:17,161 --> 00:13:18,820
She's lit
She's lit!

64
00:14:08,617 --> 00:14:10,406
Let's go.

65
00:14:27,937 --> 00:14:29,727
There we go

66
00:14:35,133 --> 00:14:41,899
I'm going to ask you to put down the money.
Step back. Tell them to step back or this man will die!

67
00:14:41,949 --> 00:14:44,378
Not a smart move, friend

68
00:14:53,569 --> 00:14:55,268
Shit

69
00:15:00,575 --> 00:15:02,644
He's fast

70
00:15:12,628 --> 00:15:19,714
Well, Tommy. It seems that there was
a Pinkerton inside that coach that wasn't quite dead

71
00:15:21,563 --> 00:15:28,800
Now, I know what Charlie told you,
because we don't got but a few rules in this outfit

72
00:15:28,850 --> 00:15:32,028
This is what happens when you put us all at risk

73
00:15:37,655 --> 00:15:44,381
Mark, look at me. Keep looking at me.
Back up quietly

74
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,479
William, look at me.

75
00:16:10,113 --> 00:16:12,252
Good morning.

76
00:16:14,620 --> 00:16:18,518
Those are my cattle.
I want them back.

77
00:16:20,927 --> 00:16:24,854
Carefully rancher. That's Ben Wades
you're talking to

78
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:31,071
I need them back.

79
00:16:31,551 --> 00:16:33,540
They are all that I've got

80
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:39,847
I don't need your cattle,
but I will be needing them horses

81
00:16:40,846 --> 00:16:44,974
So you don't go doing nohing..., Foolish

82
00:17:06,728 --> 00:17:08,657
Take the horse.

83
00:17:16,432 --> 00:17:20,360
Find them on the road to Bigsby.
Boys!

84
00:17:34,222 --> 00:17:37,331
They're probably just running late, Mr. Butterfield

85
00:17:37,381 --> 00:17:43,148
Pinkertons don't run late.
That's why they're paid 18 dollars a day.

86
00:18:45,589 --> 00:18:47,379
Get me on my feet.

87
00:18:47,449 --> 00:18:51,157
-I think you're in pretty bad shape, Mr....
-Just get me on my damned feet.

88
00:19:02,441 --> 00:19:06,098
Mark, Williams, get me some of them boards

89
00:19:29,372 --> 00:19:31,240
Can I help you ?

90
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:37,307
I think maybe a coach headed for here
got itself held up in a canyon about 10 miles back

91
00:19:37,347 --> 00:19:38,937
God damn it

92
00:19:39,376 --> 00:19:41,744
By Mr Ben Wade himself

93
00:19:41,784 --> 00:19:43,524
How did you know it was Wade?

94
00:19:43,554 --> 00:19:45,753
It's been him the last 21 times, Marshal

95
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,311
I saw a Mexican sharpshooter and an Apache

96
00:19:48,350 --> 00:19:49,850
God Damn it

97
00:19:50,659 --> 00:19:53,088
-Did you see the hand of God ?
-What's that?

98
00:19:53,168 --> 00:19:56,367
-His pistol
-Why the hell didn't you do something?

99
00:19:57,187 --> 00:20:02,604
They had a lot of weapons, Mr..
And they were shooting bullets.

100
00:20:02,654 --> 00:20:04,613
Let's go, we're wasting time

101
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:19,415
Where are you from anyway?

102
00:20:23,522 --> 00:20:28,440
Tom Conrad bought 1000 heads in Mexico,
hired us to drive them in

103
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:32,653
Let's go
Com on, boys.

104
00:20:45,946 --> 00:20:49,373
Hmmm. Something is going on with the railroad man

105
00:21:40,921 --> 00:21:45,419
Madame, some whisky for my friends.

106
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:51,666
Let's go , the bar is closed.

107
00:22:15,522 --> 00:22:19,080
Here's to the 4 that we lost in battle.

108
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:26,786
And here's to the boss who had to say good-bye to
Tommy Darlen today

109
00:22:27,805 --> 00:22:29,854
And that's too bad.

110
00:22:29,894 --> 00:22:32,232
Proverbs 13:3

111
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:40,838
"He that keepeth his mouth, keepeth his life.
He that opens his lips too wide, shall bring about his own destruction"

112
00:22:40,898 --> 00:22:42,667
Amen

113
00:22:42,707 --> 00:22:45,685
Tommy was weak
Tommy was stupid.

114
00:22:45,705 --> 00:22:47,730
Tommy is dead

115
00:22:50,228 --> 00:22:52,138
I'll drink to that

116
00:22:57,394 --> 00:22:59,763
Sutherland

117
00:23:00,603 --> 00:23:02,722
Jorgensen.

118
00:23:06,629 --> 00:23:07,988
Campos.

119
00:23:11,127 --> 00:23:13,146
Jackson.

120
00:23:14,565 --> 00:23:16,554
Kinter.

121
00:23:34,145 --> 00:23:38,243
Marshal is only half stupid.
He's going to be back soon

122
00:23:41,291 --> 00:23:45,749
They're going across the border.
I won't be far.

123
00:23:47,158 --> 00:23:49,456
I'll wait for you.

124
00:23:49,486 --> 00:23:51,795
Allright Charlie.

125
00:24:03,765 --> 00:24:07,322
I've seen you someplace before

126
00:24:08,621 --> 00:24:09,951
Have you?

127
00:24:14,028 --> 00:24:17,477
You ever worked for a blind irishman in Leadville?

128
00:24:19,835 --> 00:24:25,672
I was a singer.
The best time I ever had in my whole life

129
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,750
What made you to quit?

130
00:24:32,149 --> 00:24:37,347
I got to coughing
Doctor said I should find a dry climate

131
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:45,542
You know, I spent more money
in that joint that I could tell you

132
00:24:47,301 --> 00:24:52,488
Do you remember a girl?
Her name was Velvet.

133
00:24:54,597 --> 00:24:58,054
Nobody forgets Velvet

134
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,155
You look kind of skinny.

135
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:14,231
I feel skinny.

136
00:25:15,341 --> 00:25:16,860
It's allright.

137
00:25:19,339 --> 00:25:25,835
I don't mind skinny girls
As long as they've got green eyes to make up for it

138
00:25:28,344 --> 00:25:30,432
Have you got green eyes?

139
00:25:42,367 --> 00:25:46,455
That's right, they (?) to be green.

140
00:25:56,169 --> 00:26:00,697
Do you think they lied?
Do you think they stole our horses?

141
00:26:00,776 --> 00:26:04,205
-They dont need our shit horses.
-Watch your mouth.

142
00:26:16,942 --> 00:26:19,361
I'll take him into town on my own

143
00:26:19,441 --> 00:26:25,038
You boys go round up the herd.
Don't push them too hard, I can't afford any more dropping

144
00:26:25,078 --> 00:26:29,166
Mr, we're going to have to lift you up
to get you on top of that horse

145
00:26:29,786 --> 00:26:31,674
Here comes the cavalry.

146
00:26:36,352 --> 00:26:38,750
Do as I said

147
00:26:44,487 --> 00:26:46,546
Is he from the coach?

148
00:26:46,596 --> 00:26:48,565
The only one that made it

149
00:26:48,605 --> 00:26:51,794
-Mr. McElroy, can you hear me?
-It was Ben Wade

150
00:26:51,864 --> 00:26:53,703
Can you hear me?

151
00:26:54,812 --> 00:26:57,300
This man needs attention.

152
00:26:57,370 --> 00:26:59,899
Did you see which way they rode, Evans?

153
00:27:00,569 --> 00:27:02,698
It seemed like they were headed to Bigsby

154
00:27:52,286 --> 00:27:58,173
You know, there is a little town just south of the border

155
00:27:59,183 --> 00:28:01,981
Pretty little pueblo (?)
Down by the river

156
00:28:03,721 --> 00:28:07,648
Folks would pay good money to hear
a white woman sing

157
00:28:08,957 --> 00:28:15,024
Yeah, imagine me (shinning on?) down to Mexico with Ben Wade on my arm

158
00:28:17,063 --> 00:28:24,019
I'm not wanted in Mexico.
Jump out that back windows with me now

159
00:28:28,936 --> 00:28:31,240
You're crazy.

160
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,797
-Are you the Dr?
-Yes

161
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:41,085
-Coach got held up
-Get him on the table.

162
00:28:49,360 --> 00:28:50,930
What's his name?

163
00:28:50,970 --> 00:28:54,998
Byron McElroy, he's a bounty hunter
under contract with the Pinkertons

164
00:29:02,703 --> 00:29:05,742
You've lost a lot of blood, Mr McElroy

165
00:29:11,519 --> 00:29:14,827
-That bullet is still in there
-Get it out

166
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:27,120
Allright.

167
00:29:27,170 --> 00:29:29,928
What I'm about to do
is going to hurt like a son of a bitch

168
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:32,157
It ain't the first time I've been shot

169
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:34,716
Hold him, please

170
00:29:37,565 --> 00:29:39,869
Don't touch me.

171
00:30:18,038 --> 00:30:25,324
- What the fuck kind of Doctor are you anyway?
- It's nice to have a conversation with a patient for a change

172
00:30:53,114 --> 00:30:56,352
What the hell are they looking for?

173
00:30:57,211 --> 00:30:58,981
Ben Wade

174
00:30:59,021 --> 00:31:01,609
He held up the payroll coach

175
00:31:03,219 --> 00:31:06,586
-I want to talk, Mr. Hollander.
-Ben Wade in Bigsby

176
00:31:06,626 --> 00:31:09,555
Shit, we're moving up

177
00:31:09,635 --> 00:31:11,324
Mr. Hollander.

178
00:31:11,364 --> 00:31:12,662
Tucker, I'm going to the saloon

179
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:15,831
You've got no right to do what you've done
You hear me?

180
00:31:16,661 --> 00:31:17,930
It's my land

181
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:22,308
Come next week it's not, Evans
You borrowed a good deal of money,
and I got a right to (recompense?)

182
00:31:22,348 --> 00:31:26,246
But you damn up my creek.
You shut off my water.
How do you expect me to pay off my debt if you...?

183
00:31:28,485 --> 00:31:36,641
Before water touches your land it resides and flows on mine.
And as such, I can do with it as I fucking please.
Go home and pack up.

184
00:31:39,488 --> 00:31:42,647
Here, if you just give me till spring

185
00:31:46,056 --> 00:31:48,783
I can turn the corner

186
00:31:50,662 --> 00:31:54,661
Sometimes a man has to big enough
to see how small he is

187
00:31:55,695 --> 00:32:01,213
Railroad is coming, Dan
Your land is worth more with you off it

188
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,891
Hollander!

189
00:32:51,655 --> 00:32:57,162
You look a little bent, rancher.
You come to wake some snakes?

190
00:32:57,862 --> 00:33:00,460
Dan, would you like a drink?

191
00:33:00,510 --> 00:33:01,530
No thanks.

192
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:04,793
You got your horses back, didn't you?
And your cattle?

193
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:11,600
Yeah, I got my horses back,
but you killed two of my herd

194
00:33:11,640 --> 00:33:14,128
Hell, they died for a good cause.

195
00:33:17,337 --> 00:33:24,043
You know, them beasts of yours
They woulnd't even fetch 100 dollars.

196
00:33:26,252 --> 00:33:31,079
I'll tell you what. That should cover it

197
00:33:34,357 --> 00:33:36,746
How much do you get for a day's work?

198
00:33:36,786 --> 00:33:38,355
2 dollars, when I hire out

199
00:33:39,055 --> 00:33:41,004
There are 2 dollars for a half-day.

200
00:33:46,302 --> 00:33:48,860
You took up my boys' time too

201
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:56,765
You're right, I did

202
00:34:04,381 --> 00:34:07,869
Anything else you want to get paid for, Dan?

203
00:34:10,418 --> 00:34:13,242
Give me 5 dollars extra.

204
00:34:14,901 --> 00:34:16,630
And what's that for?

205
00:34:16,670 --> 00:34:18,839
For making me nervous

206
00:34:20,249 --> 00:34:22,937
Hands up, Ben Wade.

207
00:34:24,496 --> 00:34:26,935
Boss!

208
00:34:29,982 --> 00:34:34,850
-Give me your hands, Mr. Wade
-Tucker take his gun
- Give me that

209
00:34:36,450 --> 00:34:38,548
Ben Wade

210
00:34:41,057 --> 00:34:43,545
Captured in Bigsby

211
00:34:44,195 --> 00:34:47,294
Be careful with that thing
My gun's got a curse on it

212
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,571
Laugh while you can.

213
00:34:52,611 --> 00:34:57,348
Crawley, go get the wagon.
Make sure every weapons we've got is (shoot?) ready

214
00:34:57,368 --> 00:34:59,547
I'll meet you up front of the office.

215
00:34:59,587 --> 00:35:01,976
-Get him out of here.
-Sure thing

216
00:35:02,006 --> 00:35:05,074
I think we should shoot him right now

217
00:35:06,013 --> 00:35:08,502
Put a bullet right in his nogging

218
00:35:08,582 --> 00:35:13,079
If you do that, everybody in this
shit piss of a town will be dead by morning

219
00:35:19,227 --> 00:35:28,497
22 robberies,
over 400 thousand dollars in losses
More in delays

220
00:35:28,987 --> 00:35:35,823
The Southern Pacific will have Ben Wade
convicted in a Federal court. Hanged

221
00:35:35,853 --> 00:35:39,880
...in public, an example made

222
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,489
And we will pay to make it happen

223
00:35:43,569 --> 00:35:45,998
You all notice he didn't mention of the lives I've taken

224
00:35:46,058 --> 00:35:48,006
I need three more men.

225
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:50,535
-You can have Tucker.
-Good

226
00:35:50,575 --> 00:35:52,874
I'm coming, you only need one

227
00:35:52,913 --> 00:35:55,043
You're wounded, Mr. McElroy.

228
00:35:55,083 --> 00:35:58,201
I rode in here. Sure as hell I can ride out

229
00:35:58,291 --> 00:36:01,780
-He goes, Potter's coming
-What?!

230
00:36:03,149 --> 00:36:05,127
Doc can't shoot shit

231
00:36:05,147 --> 00:36:09,685
I was better shot of my regiment. I'll come

232
00:36:11,594 --> 00:36:13,992
For 200 dollars.

233
00:36:15,801 --> 00:36:18,430
You fight for the north or the south?

234
00:36:19,030 --> 00:36:20,548
North.

235
00:36:20,598 --> 00:36:25,656
We are southern in name,
but Chicago owned. Fine

236
00:36:25,736 --> 00:36:27,565
200 dollars.

237
00:36:27,595 --> 00:36:29,189
Let's go

238
00:36:40,353 --> 00:36:43,162
-Thank you
-Thank me when it's done

239
00:37:19,633 --> 00:37:22,541
This town is going to burn!

240
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:28,628
Let's get him, boys!

241
00:37:38,158 --> 00:37:40,567
Get in the coach

242
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:58,247
God Damn it.
Evans, Crawley, Tucker
you need to mount up now!

243
00:37:58,277 --> 00:38:01,805
Head for Evans' ranch
I'll mee you there with the coach

244
00:38:17,537 --> 00:38:19,926
How long does he have to be here?

245
00:38:19,966 --> 00:38:25,122
A day or so. Make sure his outfit takes the bait

246
00:38:54,322 --> 00:38:59,188
Hello there. Evans
Can you give me a hand with this?

247
00:39:07,524 --> 00:39:12,281
Whatever your wife is cooking in there, smells good, Evans

248
00:39:28,942 --> 00:39:30,841
Let's go.

249
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:35,339
Good driving, Marshal

250
00:39:48,851 --> 00:39:51,950
Remind me not to play poker in this town

251
00:39:53,259 --> 00:39:56,683
Well, Marshal, give us a count

252
00:39:56,723 --> 00:39:59,592
1... 2... 3...

253
00:40:18,331 --> 00:40:22,888
Gonna check on my family when you come back, right?

254
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,367
First thing

255
00:40:49,634 --> 00:40:51,823
Madam

256
00:40:53,802 --> 00:40:57,390
Byron, an unpleasant surprise

257
00:40:58,819 --> 00:41:01,748
What happens if they catch the wagon?

258
00:41:01,818 --> 00:41:09,899
Well, you saw where his man was. He's still got to go fish the outfit.
Marshal's got a fast rig, they should reach the fort before dawn.

259
00:41:09,939 --> 00:41:13,477
His gang can't do anything in front of the whole sixth cavarly

260
00:41:28,389 --> 00:41:30,977
Did you have something to do with that?

261
00:41:32,976 --> 00:41:35,545
I hope you are proud of yourself

262
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,862
Just doing my job, Doc.

263
00:41:44,671 --> 00:41:46,359
Thanks, son

264
00:42:04,979 --> 00:42:07,498
We always wait to say grace

265
00:42:08,017 --> 00:42:10,376
We don't presume to teach other people manners

266
00:42:10,416 --> 00:42:13,210
Aren't we supposed to say grace for murderers too?

267
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:16,379
-Grace is for everyone, dear
-Then why don't we say it?

268
00:42:16,419 --> 00:42:19,687
Mark, I'd like to hear it.

269
00:42:24,884 --> 00:42:28,980
God, our father, Lord and Savior
Thank you for your love and favor

270
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:34,537
Please bless this drink and food we pray
And bless all who share with us today

271
00:42:34,597 --> 00:42:36,147
Amen.

272
00:42:37,285 --> 00:42:38,984
Amen.

273
00:42:40,094 --> 00:42:45,282
If my pa' wanted to, he could shoot you dead
He can shoot a jack rabbit at 50 yards

274
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:50,309
Shooting an animal is a lot different
than shooting a man, son

275
00:42:50,369 --> 00:42:55,596
Not, it isn't
Not in my opinion.

276
00:42:57,075 --> 00:43:05,281
We can ask Byron here.
Now Byron, he's killed dozens of people.
Men and women and children. Miners, Apaches

277
00:43:05,990 --> 00:43:10,318
Not a soul I've taken that didn't deserve what they've got

278
00:43:11,387 --> 00:43:19,254
"Every way of a man is right in his own eyes", Byron,
"but the Lord ponders the heart"

279
00:43:21,158 --> 00:43:23,657
Proverbs 21

280
00:43:38,368 --> 00:43:40,197
Dan

281
00:43:45,564 --> 00:43:48,762
You eat more when you're nervous, Mr Butterfield?

282
00:43:49,772 --> 00:43:54,590
Why, thank you, Dan.
How pleasant and kind of you. Much appreciated it

283
00:43:55,080 --> 00:44:00,757
Could you cut that for me?
Could you cut that fat out, I don't particularly like the fat at all.

284
00:44:01,317 --> 00:44:03,095
Allright.

285
00:44:05,524 --> 00:44:09,112
And the (grissle?)
I don't like (grissle?)

286
00:44:15,798 --> 00:44:18,817
Do you mind if I ask you how you got
that hitch in your step, Dan?

287
00:44:18,867 --> 00:44:21,425
Don't tell him nothing, Mr Evans.

288
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,562
Where were you stationed?

289
00:44:29,296 --> 00:44:33,394
7th company of sharpshooters, out of (?) Massachusetts

290
00:44:37,672 --> 00:44:41,970
My father was defending the US capital
in the District of Columbia

291
00:44:42,969 --> 00:44:46,697
Isn't that so? Well, Dan. Tell me the story of
how you lost your leg

292
00:44:47,476 --> 00:44:52,574
Did they shoot it off? Cut it off?
Did the Indians do it?

293
00:45:03,298 --> 00:45:05,987
I saw something over there in the grass.

294
00:45:14,402 --> 00:45:16,521
There ain't nothing

295
00:45:25,206 --> 00:45:30,423
What if they caught up with the coach already?
What if they already know it's Crawley inside?

296
00:45:33,292 --> 00:45:35,741
Have you ever been to San Francisco?

297
00:45:37,975 --> 00:45:41,803
If it's all right by you, Mr. Wade,
I rather we not talk

298
00:45:42,713 --> 00:45:45,270
So you've never been in San Francisco?

299
00:45:46,580 --> 00:45:47,669
No.

300
00:45:51,818 --> 00:45:55,945
I know a girl there.
She's the daughter of a sea captain

301
00:45:55,995 --> 00:45:58,973
She had the most beautiful green eyes

302
00:46:00,283 --> 00:46:03,120
The greenest eyes
I ever saw

303
00:46:08,728 --> 00:46:10,937
Like yours.

304
00:46:14,735 --> 00:46:18,604
When I stared deep into them
they'd just change color in front of me

305
00:46:18,634 --> 00:46:21,171
All the colors of the sea.

306
00:46:29,947 --> 00:46:32,254
What did you say your name was again?

307
00:46:32,854 --> 00:46:34,563
Alice.

308
00:46:47,382 --> 00:46:51,250
For God's sake, he's killed more men than the (drought?)

309
00:46:51,280 --> 00:46:53,079
He is not what I expected

310
00:46:53,479 --> 00:46:56,916
He is dangerous
Dangerous is what he is, Alice.

311
00:46:57,416 --> 00:47:00,185
I don't want you or the boys
talking to him

312
00:47:01,814 --> 00:47:07,131
You can change your mind, Dan
None will think less of you

313
00:47:08,490 --> 00:47:12,088
None can think less of me

314
00:47:13,327 --> 00:47:16,996
6 months from now, everything is going to be great

315
00:47:17,565 --> 00:47:19,634
Cows are going to be fat

316
00:47:20,084 --> 00:47:23,453
We might even see the steam
from the train coming over the ridge

317
00:47:24,782 --> 00:47:32,648
We will be allright, but we won't make it through
the next 6 days, if I don't do this

318
00:47:37,884 --> 00:47:41,373
Sorry, Dan. McElroy says 5 minutes

319
00:47:52,797 --> 00:47:55,790
Do you think it's too much for me?

320
00:47:57,190 --> 00:47:59,489
He's a killer, Daniel.

321
00:48:00,298 --> 00:48:05,595
Yet somehow I have the decency
to bring him to justice.

322
00:48:09,803 --> 00:48:12,631
What are you thinking?

323
00:48:13,700 --> 00:48:18,038
I am not out there alone
Have a little faith in me

324
00:48:18,938 --> 00:48:23,205
Ben Wade has a gang
And they're out there tonight, somewhere

325
00:48:23,235 --> 00:48:29,282
If I don't go, we have to pack up and leave
and God knows where w/o a prayer to (?)

326
00:48:29,352 --> 00:48:33,880
Now, I am tired, Alice
I'm tired of watching my boys go hungry

327
00:48:33,950 --> 00:48:38,147
... I'm tired of the way they look at me
I'm tired of the way that you don't

328
00:48:38,857 --> 00:48:47,062
I've been standing on one leg for 3 damned years,
waiting for God to do me a favor

329
00:48:49,461 --> 00:48:51,660
And he ain't listening

330
00:48:53,369 --> 00:48:54,798
Mr. Evans.

331
00:49:06,208 --> 00:49:10,605
No, no, no. This is my horse now

332
00:49:14,113 --> 00:49:16,002
Come over here

333
00:49:23,748 --> 00:49:27,236
-Don't give me any trouble, Mark
-Yes, sir

334
00:49:30,784 --> 00:49:32,483
Boy.

335
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:34,822
-I want to come with you
-Well, you can't

336
00:49:34,842 --> 00:49:36,022
I can help.

337
00:49:36,062 --> 00:49:38,161
You're 14 years old.

338
00:49:38,191 --> 00:49:41,869
I can ride faster and
you shoot better than any one of them.

339
00:49:41,909 --> 00:49:47,355
The Pinkerton is hurt, Potter is no good,
that railroad man is dead weight, and that other bastard...

340
00:49:48,175 --> 00:49:51,474
I dont have time to argue
I need you here.

341
00:49:51,504 --> 00:49:53,372
That's that
That's that

342
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:02,577
So, boys, where are we headed?

343
00:50:02,617 --> 00:50:12,197
It ain't none of your business where we are headed, Wade.
You're a prisoner. You don't speak, you don't piss.
You don't god damn breathe unless we say so.

344
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,906
Do you understand that?

345
00:50:17,955 --> 00:50:24,251
We're taking you to Contention
Putting you on the 3:10 to Yuma, day after tomorrow

346
00:50:24,291 --> 00:50:26,180
You shouldn't have told him, now.

347
00:50:26,650 --> 00:50:31,997
Relax, friend. Now if we get separated
I'll know where to meet up

348
00:50:35,585 --> 00:50:41,451
I'd like tol thank you for your hospitality, Madame
I hope I can send your husband back allright

349
00:51:15,283 --> 00:51:19,916
What did Ben Wade mean about
sending Pa' back all right?
Is he saying he was going to kill him?

350
00:51:19,956 --> 00:51:24,444
Ben Wade don't have to lift a finger,
his gang will do it for him.

351
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:30,041
Your father can take care of himself

352
00:52:15,157 --> 00:52:21,683
So, were you conscripted into Lincoln's army, Mr. Evans?
Or did you volunteered?

353
00:52:21,743 --> 00:52:23,822
Neither...

354
00:52:25,831 --> 00:52:27,295
Maybe both.

355
00:52:27,325 --> 00:52:29,114
What does that means?

356
00:52:29,624 --> 00:52:39,429
It means I was a volunteer for the Massachusetts State Guard
Then in 62 the Federal government was running low on men
so they called in the state militias

357
00:52:40,039 --> 00:52:44,366
-To protect Washinton.
-And that's when you got hurt

358
00:52:48,344 --> 00:52:53,940
What are you doing out here, Dan?
You've got a family to protect.

359
00:52:55,040 --> 00:52:58,938
You are not a law man,
you don't work for the railroad
like Mr. shinny shoes over there

360
00:52:58,988 --> 00:53:01,447
Not a Pinkerton

361
00:53:02,257 --> 00:53:06,755
Maybe I don't like the idea of
men like you running loose

362
00:53:06,965 --> 00:53:10,752
It's man's nature
to take what he wants, Dan

363
00:53:10,792 --> 00:53:12,621
It's how we are born

364
00:53:12,671 --> 00:53:16,689
Well, I make an honest living

365
00:53:16,769 --> 00:53:20,197
It might be honest, but I don't think it's much of a living

366
00:53:20,227 --> 00:53:23,405
you must be hurting bad for money
to take this job

367
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,004
Go to sleep.

368
00:53:31,341 --> 00:53:34,639
I imagine debt puts
a lot of pressure on a marriage

369
00:53:34,709 --> 00:53:38,532
Are you married?
What would you know about marriage?

370
00:53:39,732 --> 00:53:42,871
We can't all be cutthroats and thieves

371
00:53:42,940 --> 00:53:47,437
Well, I know that if I was lucky enough to have a wife
like Alice, I'd treat her a whole lot better than you do, Dan

372
00:53:48,177 --> 00:53:53,844
I'd feed her better, I'd buy her pretty dresses.
I wouldn't make her work so hard.

373
00:53:56,442 --> 00:54:00,121
Yeah, I'd bet Alice was a real pretty girl before she married you...

374
00:54:00,151 --> 00:54:07,457
Don't talk about my wife. You shut up about her.
You say one more word and I cut your tongue.

375
00:54:10,165 --> 00:54:12,934
I'd like the sight of it if you did.

376
00:54:12,974 --> 00:54:14,763
Mr. Evans.

377
00:54:21,609 --> 00:54:24,308
It's my watch, now

378
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:03,111
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#For the night is done

379
00:55:05,870 --> 00:55:11,076
#Gonna hang me in the morning
#I'll never see the sun

380
00:55:10,556 --> 00:55:14,465
I suppose it's too much to ask for a little quiet.

381
00:55:15,664 --> 00:55:21,831
The way I figured it: I'd be asleep in my
own bed right now if it weren't for you

382
00:55:22,511 --> 00:55:27,108
So if I've got to be up,
you damn well be up with me too,

383
00:55:27,148 --> 00:55:29,907
Ben Wade.

384
00:56:02,254 --> 00:56:04,483
Son of a bitch!

385
00:56:20,224 --> 00:56:22,153
Enough.

386
00:56:25,732 --> 00:56:28,821
-Enough!
-That's enough, McElroy

387
00:56:41,674 --> 00:56:43,873
We have to bury him.

388
00:56:44,751 --> 00:56:50,579
If you take the time to dig one grave
you might as well dig one for yourself

389
00:56:53,656 --> 00:56:56,425
Let's go.
Mount up

390
00:56:57,395 --> 00:57:02,637
#Gonna hang me in the morning

391
00:57:08,015 --> 00:57:11,143
#I'll never see the sun
[Laughs]

392
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:28,656
Don't worry there, Boss
We're going to get you out of there in a second

393
00:58:43,697 --> 00:58:46,026
Wait!
Wait!

394
00:58:47,496 --> 00:58:49,995
Sutherland.

395
00:58:54,202 --> 00:58:56,001
Jackson

396
00:59:05,046 --> 00:59:06,295
No, No.
Don't do this

397
00:59:07,115 --> 00:59:11,212
Don't do this.
Don't do this.

398
00:59:11,482 --> 00:59:12,472
Where is he?

399
00:59:12,821 --> 00:59:15,690
Open the door. Open the door!
Let me out of here, God damn it!

400
00:59:15,980 --> 00:59:16,880
Where did they take him?

401
00:59:17,289 --> 00:59:18,404
I don't know!

402
00:59:23,752 --> 00:59:26,839
Mr., you'd better tell me where they took him...

403
00:59:28,219 --> 00:59:29,648
...or you will burn

404
00:59:36,424 --> 00:59:37,323
Contention!
Allright?!

405
00:59:38,123 --> 00:59:39,423
They're going to Contention

406
00:59:40,022 --> 00:59:43,610
They're going to put him on the
3:10 to Yuma prison. Tomorrow

407
00:59:47,828 --> 00:59:48,927
Let me go out of here!

408
00:59:52,536 --> 00:59:57,454
Contention is... 80 miles
back to the other way.

409
00:59:58,343 --> 00:59:59,742
They've just about killed our horses

410
01:00:00,152 --> 01:00:01,741
So, we'll buy new ones.

411
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:06,468
Charlie, it's his own fault he got caught
He made a mistake.

412
01:00:09,346 --> 01:00:11,715
You think you can do a better job
leading this group?

413
01:00:12,485 --> 01:00:13,284
Maybe...

414
01:00:19,221 --> 01:00:22,479
You've forgotten what he
done for us?

415
01:00:29,121 --> 01:00:30,311
We're going to Contention!

416
01:00:42,734 --> 01:00:44,822
Can't say I didn't warn you

417
01:00:48,471 --> 01:00:49,950
There's a shortcut we can take

418
01:00:51,040 --> 01:00:51,729
A shortcut?

419
01:00:52,478 --> 01:00:53,458
Through the pass

420
01:00:54,037 --> 01:00:55,327
It takes you right through Contention

421
01:00:55,737 --> 01:00:56,756
Why didnt you say something before?

422
01:00:57,236 --> 01:00:58,725
It's Apache country

423
01:00:59,435 --> 01:01:03,083
-I thought that the government gave them land.
-These are the ones who refused to go.

424
01:01:03,563 --> 01:01:05,952
-I wouldn't take that path
-You want us to take the long way?

425
01:01:06,292 --> 01:01:08,381
-That's right
-and let your boys catch us?

426
01:01:10,899 --> 01:01:15,237
Mr.. Butterfield, the Apache who lived
in that path are the ones that stayed to fight

427
01:01:16,396 --> 01:01:17,795
They enjoy killing

428
01:01:18,994 --> 01:01:20,084
You ain't going to make it

429
01:01:23,992 --> 01:01:25,691
We'll take our chances

430
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:55,840
Something on your mind, Dan?

431
01:01:57,979 --> 01:01:59,068
Why did you kill Tucker?

432
01:02:00,477 --> 01:02:02,766
Why not me? Or Butterfield?

433
01:02:03,685 --> 01:02:05,245
Hell, Tucker took my horse.

434
01:02:07,394 --> 01:02:09,483
Did you liked him, Dan?
-No

435
01:02:11,432 --> 01:02:13,391
He told me he burned down your barn

436
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:16,589
He was an asshole

437
01:02:18,638 --> 01:02:21,106
But wishing him dead and
killing him are two different things

438
01:02:22,196 --> 01:02:24,105
Your conscience is sensitive, Dan

439
01:02:24,905 --> 01:02:26,543
I don't think it's my
favorite part of you.

440
01:02:27,832 --> 01:02:32,600
(?), Mr. Wade. If you want to
talk to somebody, talk to me.

441
01:02:33,750 --> 01:02:35,208
I don't like talking to you, Byron

442
01:02:35,848 --> 01:02:37,307
Not when I have the gun.

443
01:02:37,917 --> 01:02:40,846
No, that ain't it.
I just don't find you that interesting.

444
01:02:42,125 --> 01:02:44,629
Laugh it up, Doc. 'till he
guts you like a fish

445
01:02:45,349 --> 01:02:46,938
Byron is like a song with one note

446
01:02:47,738 --> 01:02:50,076
Did you ever read another book in your
life, Byron. Besides the Bible?

447
01:02:50,575 --> 01:02:51,475
No need

448
01:02:55,682 --> 01:02:58,441
Byron acts pius. A few years ago when
he was under contract with Central,

449
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,588
I've seen him and a bunch of brother Pinks ...

450
01:03:02,348 --> 01:03:04,377
... mow down 32 Apache women and children

451
01:03:05,547 --> 01:03:08,705
Renegades. Gunning down railroad men and their families ...

452
01:03:09,054 --> 01:03:11,313
... picking them off the road, one by one. Scalped.

453
01:03:12,383 --> 01:03:15,831
There was young'nes running around.
Crying and screaming
No more than 3 years old

454
01:03:16,531 --> 01:03:20,299
... and his boys shot them all
and pushed them into a ditch

455
01:03:20,639 --> 01:03:22,198
Some of them were still crying

456
01:03:24,817 --> 01:03:28,504
I guess Byron figured that Jesus
wouldn't mind

457
01:03:30,514 --> 01:03:32,643
Apparently Jesus don't like the Apache

458
01:03:34,212 --> 01:03:35,310
Keep on talking...

459
01:03:36,580 --> 01:03:43,436
All the way to Yuma. Right up on them steps
to the rope. Straight to hell

460
01:03:44,315 --> 01:03:45,615
Yeah, the day I die, Byron

461
01:03:46,554 --> 01:03:48,104
I'm getting sprung from hell

462
01:03:48,863 --> 01:03:55,645
I might feel the same, if I'd come from the seed of a
drunk grave digger and the rancid womb of a whore

463
01:04:09,897 --> 01:04:10,587
Drop it, Dan Evans.
Drop it

464
01:04:11,396 --> 01:04:12,476
Toss it to the ground, Doc

465
01:04:13,935 --> 01:04:15,225
Mr. Butterfield...

466
01:04:18,992 --> 01:04:25,299
I believe, Dan, you're carrying a pistol as well.
I'd appreciate it if you take it out
and drop it on the ground. Thank you

467
01:04:31,936 --> 01:04:37,153
Now, I've always liked you, Byron, ...

468
01:04:36,013 --> 01:04:37,643
..., but you never knew when to shut up

469
01:04:41,921 --> 01:04:44,109
Even bad men love their mommas

470
01:04:49,556 --> 01:04:51,525
Now I think it's time
for everybody to go home

471
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,023
Don't you move, Mr. Wade.

472
01:04:55,033 --> 01:04:56,232
Let go of that shotgun.

473
01:04:58,331 --> 01:05:00,745
William, what the hell are you doing here?

474
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:05,923
I don't think that you're going to shoot a man (?)
in the back of the head, boy

475
01:05:07,102 --> 01:05:09,780
Dan, tell your boy it's over

476
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,489
You think you can keep you gun on him, William?

477
01:05:14,598 --> 01:05:17,626
I'm doing a damn sight better than you did

478
01:06:03,861 --> 01:06:05,660
You ever been to Dodge City?

479
01:06:09,594 --> 01:06:10,583
No.

480
01:06:12,322 --> 01:06:13,522
Stop talking to him

481
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:21,327
The way you're shuffling those cards,
I took you for a pro

482
01:06:22,737 --> 01:06:23,926
I practice a lot.

483
01:06:24,566 --> 01:06:25,326
I can tell

484
01:06:33,631 --> 01:06:34,629
You ever been to Dodge?

485
01:06:35,139 --> 01:06:36,129
Yes, indeed

486
01:06:37,568 --> 01:06:40,237
Meanest, most beautiful, dirty city there ever was

487
01:06:40,747 --> 01:06:46,384
Saloons just overflowing with cattle drivers and road agents,
prospectors, gunslingers, gamblers and women

488
01:06:49,853 --> 01:06:51,791
Women will do things to you you'll never forget.

489
01:06:54,260 --> 01:06:55,949
They'll give you disease you'll never forget

490
01:06:56,389 --> 01:06:59,757
Money in your pocket in Dodge City
you can have everything a man ever wished for

491
01:07:02,595 --> 01:07:03,894
Everything a man comes to need

492
01:07:07,803 --> 01:07:10,091
I got (?) I was a boy not much bigger than you

493
01:07:11,740 --> 01:07:14,139
Now, how many men have you killed since then, Wade?

494
01:07:17,332 --> 01:07:18,822
How many families have you destroyed?

495
01:07:23,470 --> 01:07:25,778
Quite a few

496
01:07:29,276 --> 01:07:34,373
Is it true that you dynamited a wagon
full of prospectors in the Western Territories last spring?

497
01:07:35,182 --> 01:07:36,082
No, that's a lie.

498
01:07:37,282 --> 01:07:38,591
It was a train full

499
01:07:48,026 --> 01:07:49,085
(?), Dan

500
01:07:52,494 --> 01:07:53,723
I gotta take a piss

501
01:07:56,902 --> 01:07:58,761
You know, I thought he was going to
shoot me back in the ravine

502
01:08:00,829 --> 01:08:02,128
I really thought he was going to do it

503
01:08:02,458 --> 01:08:04,078
There was a wildness in his eyes.
He reminds me ...

504
01:08:04,517 --> 01:08:05,887
He's going to be nothing like you, Wade

505
01:08:12,053 --> 01:08:14,612
A man's got to have a head start
on the path of decency

506
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,148
Yeah, that's why I don't mess around
with doing anything good, Dan.

507
01:08:25,461 --> 01:08:26,980
Dou do one good deed for somebody...

508
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:30,079
I imagine it's habit forming

509
01:08:31,998 --> 01:08:35,745
Something decent. See that grateful
look in their eyes....

510
01:08:36,395 --> 01:08:38,364
... I imagine it makes feel like christ hisself

511
01:08:38,764 --> 01:08:41,163
I've had enough of this, Wade.
Come on. Let's go

512
01:09:36,338 --> 01:09:38,527
It's three of them
-Yours?

513
01:09:39,027 --> 01:09:40,337
If they were mine, you'd be dead

514
01:09:43,834 --> 01:09:44,814
Give me that gun, Wade!

515
01:10:35,796 --> 01:10:36,925
I told you not to come this way

516
01:10:38,115 --> 01:10:39,544
It was McElroy's decision.

517
01:10:40,044 --> 01:10:41,214
I told you there'd be trouble

518
01:10:47,036 --> 01:10:48,245
Give me the keys to the handcuffs

519
01:11:15,399 --> 01:11:16,469
Easy. Easy now

520
01:11:17,888 --> 01:11:18,818
Where is he?

521
01:11:19,677 --> 01:11:20,507
He's gone

522
01:11:23,426 --> 01:11:26,783
He took the horses with him.
I found this in the grass

523
01:11:33,530 --> 01:11:38,487
That's the quickest way out of the pass
He'll be looking for help, to get his cuffs off

524
01:11:40,246 --> 01:11:41,516
We are going after him.

525
01:11:42,824 --> 01:11:45,813
There ain't no reward for getting him
halfway to that train, is there?

526
01:13:00,064 --> 01:13:03,262
I've got to be honest with you,
I like some of their food.

527
01:13:03,872 --> 01:13:06,571
As for wanting $40 a month now,
I can...

528
01:13:08,109 --> 01:13:09,069
Hello, Love.

529
01:13:10,318 --> 01:13:14,236
God damned Coolies. They'll work just fine
with my left boot up their ass

530
01:13:14,546 --> 01:13:16,804
Well, if I could teach a monkey
to lay track, ...

531
01:13:18,144 --> 01:13:20,842
Well. What we need here are some negros
brought here, Mister Boles

532
01:13:21,352 --> 01:13:23,111
Show these Chinamen what real work is

533
01:13:31,826 --> 01:13:33,326
Holly Christ!

534
01:13:35,025 --> 01:13:36,125
Who is that?

535
01:13:37,124 --> 01:13:38,224
That's him!

536
01:13:41,232 --> 01:13:43,470
-Help me with the handcuffs

537
01:13:46,439 --> 01:13:48,268
Break the chain.
Use the hammer.
Break the chain.

538
01:13:52,635 --> 01:13:55,464
I have 5 guns on you out here, Ben Wade

539
01:13:56,044 --> 01:13:57,133
Just come on out!

540
01:14:16,807 --> 01:14:17,647
The horses.

541
01:14:40,825 --> 01:14:41,934
What the hell is going on here?

542
01:14:45,243 --> 01:14:48,241
Mr. Butterfield, all finished in Bigsby?

543
01:14:48,751 --> 01:14:49,541
Mr. Boles

544
01:14:57,876 --> 01:15:01,174
You'd better hurry. We're making the last blasts
through the mountains this week.

545
01:15:01,782 --> 01:15:02,652
That's my prisoner.

546
01:15:03,172 --> 01:15:05,990
We're taking him to Contention,
putting him on the prison train to Yuma.

547
01:15:07,460 --> 01:15:08,648
What prisoner?

548
01:15:09,658 --> 01:15:12,986
Come now, Mr. Boles. That's
Ben Wade you have there

549
01:15:13,686 --> 01:15:17,429
Ben Wade gunned down my kid brother, ...

550
01:15:17,529 --> 01:15:19,638
... in front of me, 6 years ago in Abeline

551
01:15:20,358 --> 01:15:22,407
Your brother was a lying (?) card shark

552
01:15:26,154 --> 01:15:32,032
That is, if he is the asshole I remember.
He could of course be some other asshole I've killed
that I've forgot about

553
01:15:46,873 --> 01:15:49,242
You can't do that. That's immoral.

554
01:15:51,841 --> 01:15:53,570
Immoral ain't got a damned thing to do with it

555
01:15:58,838 --> 01:16:01,646
I was expecting to collect a $200 reward for that man.

556
01:16:04,165 --> 01:16:07,572
I'm delivering him to Contention,
I need that money.

557
01:16:08,442 --> 01:16:11,070
Need it bad enough to die?

558
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:23,404
At least let us take our horses.

559
01:16:24,304 --> 01:16:25,808
I've got no problem with that

560
01:16:26,548 --> 01:16:28,307
As long as you ride away, Mr.

561
01:16:29,906 --> 01:16:32,245
Nice knowing you, Dan

562
01:17:52,856 --> 01:17:53,826
God damn it!

563
01:18:08,778 --> 01:18:13,096
Did we make it?
Did we get away?

564
01:18:13,316 --> 01:18:16,084
Yeah, Doc. We did

565
01:18:18,083 --> 01:18:19,492
Thanks to you.

566
01:18:43,934 --> 01:18:48,922
We need a place to lay low. Keep him
out of sight 'till the train comes

567
01:18:50,061 --> 01:18:54,129
There is a hotel up here, I'll check to see,
and you ride around back

568
01:19:04,343 --> 01:19:08,549
Hey, Will. You keep a watch on the rail head
You see them coming...

569
01:19:08,649 --> 01:19:10,039
I'll let you know

570
01:19:11,338 --> 01:19:12,368
William!

571
01:19:30,858 --> 01:19:32,936
There's a Can-Can on the outs, if you're interested...

572
01:19:51,202 --> 01:19:54,531
It's the Bridal Suite,
I hope you don't mind, it's all they had

573
01:20:11,531 --> 01:20:14,780
Well, well. That looks like rain clouds over Bigsby

574
01:20:15,868 --> 01:20:18,387
You still need that $200, Dan?

575
01:20:18,397 --> 01:20:19,767
Shut up

576
01:20:22,006 --> 01:20:25,474
Mr.. Evans, you continue to give
me great confidence

577
01:20:28,693 --> 01:20:31,122
I'm going to see about the Marshal.

578
01:20:48,612 --> 01:20:54,258
We're looking for a group escorting
and outlaw by the name of Ben Wade

579
01:20:54,608 --> 01:20:56,707
Yeah, we've been chasing them
through these tunnels

580
01:21:02,939 --> 01:21:03,859
Who you are?

581
01:21:04,469 --> 01:21:05,528
What's it to you?

582
01:21:06,738 --> 01:21:08,476
Ben Wade killed my brother.

583
01:21:09,246 --> 01:21:11,345
Then your brother must be famous

584
01:21:15,213 --> 01:21:19,010
Are you, boys, some kind of posse?

585
01:21:30,294 --> 01:21:31,993
I hate posses

586
01:21:40,400 --> 01:21:41,998
So this is the Bridal Suite.

587
01:21:43,397 --> 01:21:47,336
Now, I wonder how many brides
have taken in this view

588
01:21:51,343 --> 01:21:53,102
What are you going to do with your $200 now, Dan?

589
01:21:53,602 --> 01:21:55,201
Now that the rains are coming

590
01:21:56,750 --> 01:22:00,118
I owe people money, Wade.
That drought left me in the hole

591
01:22:03,516 --> 01:22:05,416
What do you think about double that amount?

592
01:22:07,150 --> 01:22:10,778
You can pay your debts,
buy a hundred more cows

593
01:22:11,788 --> 01:22:12,977
Build a new barn

594
01:22:13,517 --> 01:22:15,016
How do you reckon I'm going to do that?

595
01:22:17,814 --> 01:22:21,212
Just lay down your gun
and let me walk out the door.
It's worth $400 (?)

596
01:22:23,521 --> 01:22:25,060
Is that what you reckon my price is?

597
01:22:26,489 --> 01:22:27,579
No...

598
01:22:30,088 --> 01:22:34,425
No, I reckon it's a thousand
One thousand dollars

599
01:22:34,584 --> 01:22:37,193
There was ten times that amount
in Butterfield's coach

600
01:22:38,303 --> 01:22:41,302
Do you want my cut, Dan?
It's all yours.

601
01:22:42,711 --> 01:22:45,010
Isn't that kind of reckless of you Wade?

602
01:22:46,099 --> 01:22:49,637
Seeing that... Hmmm. You're so sure that
your crew is coming to get you

603
01:22:51,656 --> 01:22:52,805
Oh, they're coming, Dan

604
01:22:54,745 --> 01:22:56,904
Sure as God's vengeance, they're coming

605
01:23:00,121 --> 01:23:01,950
But I just like to do things easy

606
01:23:04,529 --> 01:23:06,607
Imagine what you can do with $1000, Dan?

607
01:23:07,837 --> 01:23:11,015
You can hire a couple of ranch hands.
Your boys could go to school, grow up smart.

608
01:23:12,025 --> 01:23:13,654
What about Alice?

609
01:23:14,884 --> 01:23:18,177
She wouuld be the proud wife
of a bonafide Arizona rancher

610
01:23:21,386 --> 01:23:23,175
All you've got to do is say yes

611
01:23:31,990 --> 01:23:37,127
Will you give me a bank note, Wade?
Or will you be kind enough to make a deposit for me?

612
01:23:37,736 --> 01:23:38,726
Cash.

613
01:23:43,943 --> 01:23:49,000
You tell me, Wade. How will I
account for that amount of money?

614
01:23:51,119 --> 01:23:54,338
What will I tell people when I spend it?

615
01:23:54,728 --> 01:24:00,724
That you got the jump on me, you escaped,
and somehow I got a fortune

616
01:24:04,852 --> 01:24:06,272
No. How dumb do you think people are?

617
01:24:07,440 --> 01:24:08,720
Nobody needs to know

618
01:24:13,068 --> 01:24:14,057
Do you know what?

619
01:24:14,657 --> 01:24:15,496
Would you do me a favor?

620
01:24:17,155 --> 01:24:18,764
Don't talk to me for a while.

621
01:24:20,004 --> 01:24:21,813
You mean
we're still not friends?

622
01:24:22,572 --> 01:24:26,795
No. No, we're not

623
01:24:28,605 --> 01:24:33,012
Come 5 minutes to 3, we're going to be
a hell of a lot closer than you think

624
01:24:40,817 --> 01:24:44,905
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

625
01:24:47,034 --> 01:24:49,642
#For the night is done

626
01:24:51,032 --> 01:24:55,440
#They're gonna hang me in the morning

627
01:24:57,619 --> 01:25:00,118
#I'll never see the sun

628
01:25:15,769 --> 01:25:16,358
Who is it?

629
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:18,068
It's me, Dan

630
01:25:18,877 --> 01:25:19,857
I brought help

631
01:25:20,876 --> 01:25:23,814
You've been gone for a long time, Mr. Butterfield

632
01:25:24,184 --> 01:25:27,602
How do I know someone ain't got
a gun on you out there?

633
01:25:42,810 --> 01:25:45,009
Dan, this is Marshal Will Doane

634
01:25:45,918 --> 01:25:48,307
Marshal
-Mr. Evans

635
01:25:50,445 --> 01:25:52,444
Two of my finest men

636
01:25:58,730 --> 01:26:01,559
I'm sorry about all that, Marshal,
I am grateful for the help

637
01:26:01,849 --> 01:26:02,919
Don't mention it

638
01:26:03,428 --> 01:26:06,317
So, you fellows are really going
to help to put me on this train?

639
01:26:07,337 --> 01:26:09,426
It might not seem like it, Mr.. Wade,

640
01:26:10,385 --> 01:26:12,774
but we got law and order in this town,
just like in any other

641
01:26:13,084 --> 01:26:15,992
Well, that's very reassuring, Marshal

642
01:26:16,412 --> 01:26:18,211
How much money is Butterfield paying you?

643
01:26:18,771 --> 01:26:21,000
That's not of your business

644
01:26:21,669 --> 01:26:22,589
You're coming with us?

645
01:26:23,269 --> 01:26:24,507
I'll be walking with you

646
01:26:25,716 --> 01:26:27,016
Every step of the way.

647
01:26:28,765 --> 01:26:29,885
You have my word on that, Dan

648
01:26:30,684 --> 01:26:34,132
That makes five of us. Five is good

649
01:26:37,720 --> 01:26:42,963
It ain't enough

650
01:26:39,299 --> 01:26:40,804
It ain't nearly enough

651
01:27:04,461 --> 01:27:05,331
Pa!

652
01:27:05,731 --> 01:27:06,629
That's my boy

653
01:27:09,468 --> 01:27:10,258
They're coming.

654
01:27:13,006 --> 01:27:14,406
They are coming this way I've seen them
-Where?

655
01:27:14,506 --> 01:27:16,614
About a mile out, same way we come

656
01:27:16,984 --> 01:27:18,783
how many are they?
-Seven, ... Eight.

657
01:27:19,183 --> 01:27:21,622
Which is it? 7 or 8?

658
01:27:24,409 --> 01:27:25,589
Seven.

659
01:27:36,813 --> 01:27:41,510
Folks, sorry to bother you, but I'm going
to need you to move outside as quickly as possible

660
01:27:42,409 --> 01:27:46,118
That's it, folks.
Move along

661
01:27:55,968 --> 01:27:56,798
Right there.

662
01:28:15,606 --> 01:28:19,745
Sure there're a lot of them
- You'd figure, with it being the whole gang

663
01:28:45,541 --> 01:28:47,630
Boss?
Boss?

664
01:28:50,548 --> 01:28:51,537
Boss, are you are in there?

665
01:28:52,977 --> 01:28:54,346
What do you want me to tell them?

666
01:28:56,245 --> 01:28:58,679
You tell them you'll write
them a letter every day from Yuma

667
01:29:07,784 --> 01:29:08,974
Be careful, Wade.

668
01:29:14,490 --> 01:29:16,479
Charlie,
Boys.

669
01:29:18,788 --> 01:29:21,877
Charlie, why don't you take the boys
down to the saloon and boy them a drink

670
01:29:24,085 --> 01:29:25,284
Are you ok?

671
01:29:26,494 --> 01:29:29,523
I am fine. Just sitting up here with
my 4 new friends

672
01:29:32,341 --> 01:29:33,501
That's enough

673
01:29:38,708 --> 01:29:39,898
Thank You, Charlie.

674
01:30:01,025 --> 01:30:01,945
Listen up!

675
01:30:02,665 --> 01:30:03,814
Listen up!!

676
01:30:05,848 --> 01:30:07,757
That's Ben Wade they have up there!

677
01:30:09,247 --> 01:30:11,436
Ben Wade!

678
01:30:16,393 --> 01:30:20,081
Now, the railroad intends...

679
01:30:22,999 --> 01:30:27,727
... to put him on the 3:10 to Yuma and hang him

680
01:30:28,826 --> 01:30:29,996
What's he doing?

681
01:30:36,432 --> 01:30:40,440
We will give you $300 cash

682
01:30:41,819 --> 01:30:45,258
To any man who shoots
anyone of his captors

683
01:30:46,727 --> 01:30:50,414
$200 cash guaranteed!

684
01:30:56,822 --> 01:30:59,729
$200 guaranteed!

685
01:31:05,926 --> 01:31:07,115
I'll take $200
Give me the money

686
01:31:07,465 --> 01:31:09,254
You've got to shoot them first

687
01:31:15,996 --> 01:31:18,395
It's gotta be 30 or 40 with guns out there now

688
01:31:20,233 --> 01:31:21,323
The hell with this!

689
01:31:22,792 --> 01:31:24,870
Now, just a minute, Marshal

690
01:31:26,050 --> 01:31:32,516
Now, look. If it's a fair fight, sure.
I'd stay for that. A fair fight ...

691
01:31:33,115 --> 01:31:35,194
That's a man's duty, but...

692
01:31:36,104 --> 01:31:38,193
There's only 5 of us

693
01:31:38,963 --> 01:31:42,800
I'm sorry, Mr, but I'm not going to die here today

694
01:31:46,508 --> 01:31:47,868
And neither are my men

695
01:31:47,878 --> 01:31:48,927
Marshal, ...

696
01:31:52,226 --> 01:31:54,625
You forgot this

697
01:31:59,212 --> 01:32:00,101
Marshal?

698
01:32:06,627 --> 01:32:10,346
Now, you see, Dan. Generally, ...

699
01:32:10,416 --> 01:32:11,605
... pretty much everyone ...

700
01:32:12,315 --> 01:32:13,275
.... wants to live

701
01:32:13,654 --> 01:32:14,953
I'll double your money

702
01:32:15,153 --> 01:32:16,172
Let's go, boys

703
01:32:16,752 --> 01:32:19,441
Please, do you want to see
us shot down in the street?

704
01:32:19,861 --> 01:32:21,040
This thing happened in Bigsby

705
01:32:21,660 --> 01:32:22,804
That means Butterfield too

706
01:32:23,184 --> 01:32:24,583
Why bring your troubles to Contention?

707
01:32:24,783 --> 01:32:27,582
We've got families
Everyone of us is a family man

708
01:32:27,882 --> 01:32:29,071
I'm a family man too

709
01:32:30,081 --> 01:32:32,529
He's gona walk out on you

710
01:32:33,489 --> 01:32:36,517
Then you'd best get out
like the rest of us

711
01:32:40,424 --> 01:32:44,483
He's (not?) gonna come back up here
He's gonna walk out on you

712
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:50,839
Now, what you've got to figure
is why you and your boy are gonna die ...

713
01:32:53,897 --> 01:32:57,146
... because of Butterfield's railroad loss of money?

714
01:33:26,650 --> 01:33:27,849
They're all of them?

715
01:33:33,192 --> 01:33:34,121
Almost.

716
01:33:37,100 --> 01:33:38,390
Your move, general

717
01:33:42,697 --> 01:33:44,526
What do you expect him to say?

718
01:33:44,966 --> 01:33:46,595
I expect him to say something that makes sense.

719
01:33:47,604 --> 01:33:49,832
Something that might save the two of you.

720
01:33:50,312 --> 01:33:54,091
Take a look, Dan
What's the matter? You don't want to see?

721
01:33:55,100 --> 01:33:56,130
I'll see them soon enough

722
01:33:57,138 --> 01:33:58,418
What about you, kid?
You wanna  look?

723
01:33:58,438 --> 01:33:59,707
Stay away from the window, William.

724
01:34:00,247 --> 01:34:01,506
Go on take a look.

725
01:34:03,315 --> 01:34:06,154
They're animals
All of them

726
01:34:10,852 --> 01:34:13,601
They're gonna kill you and your father, William

727
01:34:15,859 --> 01:34:18,108
And I'll laugh while they do it

728
01:34:18,418 --> 01:34:19,647
I think you know that

729
01:34:20,297 --> 01:34:21,456
Call them them off

730
01:34:23,924 --> 01:34:24,904
Why should I?

731
01:34:25,683 --> 01:34:26,873
Because you're not all bad

732
01:34:31,890 --> 01:34:33,089
Yes, I am

733
01:34:33,989 --> 01:34:36,488
Your saved us from those Indians.
-I saved myself

734
01:34:37,327 --> 01:34:39,931
You got us through the tunnels
You helped us get away

735
01:34:40,321 --> 01:34:44,219
If I had a gun in them tunnels,
I would've used it on you.

736
01:34:48,956 --> 01:34:49,926
I don't believe you.

737
01:34:50,455 --> 01:34:55,453
Kid, I wouldn't last 5 minutes leading an outfit
like that if I wasn't as rotten as hell.

738
01:35:16,182 --> 01:35:17,172
Dan, ...

739
01:35:26,595 --> 01:35:27,585
I can't do it,

740
01:35:27,985 --> 01:35:30,783
Dan, and if I can't do it,
you shouldn't do it either

741
01:35:33,791 --> 01:35:35,690
They say discretion is the (better?) part of valor

742
01:35:36,100 --> 01:35:38,139
If you think that you have an
olbigation to me or to the railroad...

743
01:35:38,399 --> 01:35:41,986
... I assure you you do not, I'm releasing you

744
01:35:42,496 --> 01:35:46,095
It's just you left, Dan. Just you and your boy

745
01:35:46,714 --> 01:35:50,068
Maybe he is right, Pa,
maybe we should go home

746
01:35:57,524 --> 01:36:00,662
What did Doc Potter gave his life for, William?

747
01:36:01,922 --> 01:36:02,971
And McElroy?

748
01:36:03,071 --> 01:36:05,159
Little red ants on a hill

749
01:36:04,830 --> 01:36:09,277
I'll pay you the $200, Dan. Right now.
And you can walk away

750
01:36:14,014 --> 01:36:17,912
You know, this whole ride,
it's been nagging on me ...

751
01:36:20,511 --> 01:36:23,000
... that's what the government
gave me for my leg ...

752
01:36:24,699 --> 01:36:28,148
... $198.36 and the funny thing is that...

753
01:36:29,187 --> 01:36:30,187
... when you think about it ...

754
01:36:30,806 --> 01:36:40,061
... -which I have been lately-
is that they weren't paying me to walk away.
They were paying me so they could walk away.

755
01:36:42,030 --> 01:36:44,099
Don't muddy the past on the present, Dan

756
01:36:44,339 --> 01:36:47,567
No, no, no, Wade. I'm seeing the world the way it is

757
01:36:48,436 --> 01:36:51,325
If you take him to the train, Pa, I'm going with you

758
01:36:51,405 --> 01:36:54,143
No, Mr. Butterfield's gonna take you home

759
01:36:54,623 --> 01:36:56,837
No, I'm not going any...
-Yes, you are

760
01:36:56,967 --> 01:36:58,336
I'm staying here with you

761
01:36:58,636 --> 01:37:02,555
You're going to hold up in the room
across the hall. You're going to wait until we leave.

762
01:37:03,074 --> 01:37:05,562
I'll get him to Bigsby.
You've got my promise

763
01:37:05,852 --> 01:37:07,541
You're going to promise a lot more than that, Butterfield

764
01:37:08,651 --> 01:37:16,376
I want guarantees that Hollander and his boys
will never set foot on my land again

765
01:37:16,776 --> 01:37:24,392
And that my water is going to flow.
And I expect you to hand my wife $1000 cash
when you see her. You've got money to spare

766
01:37:24,592 --> 01:37:28,610
I can deliver that, just get him on the train.

767
01:37:30,539 --> 01:37:32,938
You heard him?
-I heard him.

768
01:37:35,137 --> 01:37:36,526
William...

769
01:37:37,406 --> 01:37:39,804
...I want you to give this back to your mother

770
01:37:42,013 --> 01:37:48,039
I want you to tell her it helped
me find what is right

771
01:37:53,417 --> 01:37:57,944
Pa, I can't just leave you

772
01:37:58,314 --> 01:38:04,261
I'm going to be a day behind you, William
Unless something happens. And if it does,
I need a man at the ranch

773
01:38:05,286 --> 01:38:10,043
To run things; to protect our family.
And I know that you can do that because
you've become a fine man, William

774
01:38:11,383 --> 01:38:13,611
You've become a fine man
You've got all the best parts of me ...

775
01:38:14,980 --> 01:38:16,180
... what few there are

776
01:38:21,587 --> 01:38:30,432
And you just remember
that your old man hauled Ben Wade to that station
when nobody else would

777
01:39:25,168 --> 01:39:28,167
You know, squeezing that watch won't stop time

778
01:39:35,402 --> 01:39:36,762
Don't get so scared.

779
01:39:37,212 --> 01:39:38,391
You might (pack?) a bad mood.

780
01:39:46,876 --> 01:39:48,376
Ever read the Bible, Dan?

781
01:39:51,094 --> 01:40:01,359
I read it one time. I was 8 years old. My daddy had just got
himself killed over a shot of whiskey and my mom said we
were going back East to start over

782
01:40:02,888 --> 01:40:07,415
So she gave me a Bible, sat me down at
the train station. Told me to read it

783
01:40:10,904 --> 01:40:12,493
She was going to get our tickets

784
01:40:15,061 --> 01:40:20,338
Well, I did what she said ...
I read that Bible cover to cover.

785
01:40:20,658 --> 01:40:21,893
It took me 3 days

786
01:40:25,471 --> 01:40:26,671
She never came back.

787
01:40:53,386 --> 01:40:54,285
It's time

788
01:41:11,796 --> 01:41:14,034
It's a half mile to the station from here, Dan

789
01:41:18,033 --> 01:41:19,132
I guess we're walking

790
01:41:58,496 --> 01:41:59,485
Lucky

791
01:42:03,224 --> 01:42:03,883
Dan...

792
01:42:37,255 --> 01:42:40,619
You're not gonna get a chance
to use those Scofields, Charlie

793
01:42:41,978 --> 01:42:45,837
Perhaps you can explain to me
the next portion of your plan, Dan

794
01:43:09,233 --> 01:43:11,202
Hey!
Hey!!

795
01:43:11,912 --> 01:43:15,290
Not the black hat!

796
01:43:16,040 --> 01:43:19,279
(?) you dumb shits!

797
01:43:29,993 --> 01:43:30,861
Charlie.

798
01:43:34,599 --> 01:43:35,958
Get back!
Get back!

799
01:43:42,094 --> 01:43:42,994
Boss!

800
01:43:48,087 --> 01:43:51,215
Let's go! White Door!
Move it!

801
01:44:14,742 --> 01:44:15,971
I can't do this no more, Dan

802
01:44:21,749 --> 01:44:23,648
I'm putting you on that train, Wade

803
01:44:22,978 --> 01:44:27,956
I'm going back!
Your boy is gone, hero. Ain't nobody watching no more

804
01:44:28,666 --> 01:44:32,643
You still got that one good leg,
why don't you use it to get on home?

805
01:44:33,363 --> 01:44:34,262
Charlie!

806
01:44:35,961 --> 01:44:36,761
Charlie Prince!

807
01:44:37,161 --> 01:44:39,259
Yeah, boss!
-Hold your fire!

808
01:44:39,769 --> 01:44:40,698
I'm walking out

809
01:45:06,710 --> 01:45:09,508
I have never been no hero, Wade

810
01:45:11,707 --> 01:45:14,535
Only (action?) I've seen, it was a retreat ...

811
01:45:15,445 --> 01:45:17,844
... my foot got shot off by one of my own men.

812
01:45:19,843 --> 01:45:22,871
You try telling that story to your boy ...

813
01:45:23,680 --> 01:45:25,239
... see how he looks at you then

814
01:45:41,271 --> 01:45:42,171
Boss!

815
01:45:47,008 --> 01:45:48,177
Ok, Dan

816
01:45:59,421 --> 01:46:00,381
Son.

817
01:46:02,580 --> 01:46:05,713
They're on the move
They're on the move!

818
01:46:06,903 --> 01:46:10,101
Boss, Boss..

819
01:46:45,033 --> 01:46:46,082
Can you make this?
- Yeah

820
01:47:51,301 --> 01:47:52,111
Spread out!...

821
01:48:04,723 --> 01:48:06,772
What time is it?

822
01:48:07,232 --> 01:48:08,242
Quarter past three

823
01:48:08,832 --> 01:48:11,131
Where is the 3:10 to Yuma?

824
01:48:11,240 --> 01:48:12,240
Running late, I suppose

825
01:48:13,069 --> 01:48:14,218
How late?

826
01:48:15,458 --> 01:48:16,287
Beats me

827
01:48:16,337 --> 01:48:17,437
It gets here when it gets here

828
01:48:18,826 --> 01:48:21,160
God damned trains,
You never can rely on them, huh?

829
01:49:00,959 --> 01:49:06,326
You know...
I ain't stubborn.

830
01:49:07,156 --> 01:49:08,155
Excuse me?

831
01:49:09,445 --> 01:49:13,852
You said I was stubborn for
keeping my family on a dying ranch

832
01:49:16,300 --> 01:49:17,650
It's my son, Mark

833
01:49:18,240 --> 01:49:19,389
The young one

834
01:49:20,149 --> 01:49:22,956
He got tuberculosis when he was 2

835
01:49:24,606 --> 01:49:27,724
Doctor said he'd die
if he didn't have a dry climate

836
01:49:28,234 --> 01:49:29,868
Why are you telling me this?

837
01:49:32,177 --> 01:49:33,157
I don't know

838
01:49:34,266 --> 01:49:38,364
I guess that I just
wanted you to know that ...

839
01:49:38,673 --> 01:49:42,672
... I ain't stubborn. That's all

840
01:50:16,833 --> 01:50:19,962
Well, as long as we're making confesions
- Yeah?

841
01:50:20,662 --> 01:50:24,959
I've been to Yuma Prison before

842
01:50:25,059 --> 01:50:28,357
Twice
Escaped twice too

843
01:51:34,077 --> 01:51:37,565
First car, sliding door

844
01:51:48,733 --> 01:51:49,883
They'll be coming

845
01:52:30,181 --> 01:52:33,400
I've got a prisoner to go to Yuma

846
01:52:38,976 --> 01:52:41,185
Well, you did it, Dan

847
01:52:42,884 --> 01:52:43,514
No!

848
01:52:53,878 --> 01:52:56,202
Pa!

849
01:53:23,817 --> 01:53:28,005
For a one legged rancher, ...

850
01:53:30,144 --> 01:53:33,233
... he's one tough son of a bitch

851
01:54:40,112 --> 01:54:40,942
