1
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:12,700
There are over 550 million firearms

2
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:15,134
in world-wide circulation.

3
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:16,706
That's one firearm for every

4
00:01:16,943 --> 00:01:19,002
twelve people on the planet.

5
00:01:19,412 --> 00:01:21,107
The only question is...

6
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,781
how do we arm the other eleven?

7
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,873
You don't have to worry.

8
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:39,272
I'm not gonna tell you a pack of
lies to make me look good.

9
00:04:39,512 --> 00:04:41,776
I'm just gonna tell you
what happened.

10
00:04:42,015 --> 00:04:43,744
My name is Yuri Orlov.

11
00:04:43,983 --> 00:04:47,146
When I was a boy,
my family came to America.

12
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:49,014
But not all the way.

13
00:04:49,255 --> 00:04:50,051
Like most Ukrainians,

14
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:52,485
we gathered in Brighton Beach.

15
00:04:52,725 --> 00:04:54,989
It reminded us of the Black Sea.

16
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:56,661
I soon realized we'd just swapped

17
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:58,796
one hell for another.

18
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:00,857
Even in hell, an angel

19
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,625
sometimes makes an appearance.

20
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:05,337
I'd worshipped Ava Fontaine

21
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,471
since I was 10 years old.

22
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:10,301
Of course, she didn't know I existed.

23
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:14,069
I was starting to think she had a point.

24
00:05:17,283 --> 00:05:19,251
For the first twenty-odd years of my life...

25
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,182
...Little Odessa was to me what it
is to the Q train...

26
00:05:23,423 --> 00:05:25,050
...the end of the line.

27
00:05:25,291 --> 00:05:26,349
"Little Odessa," New York - 1982

28
00:05:26,959 --> 00:05:29,189
Oh, I did lie about my name.

29
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:31,397
It's not really Yuri Orlov.

30
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:33,496
There've been few occasions
in the in the 20th century...

31
00:05:33,733 --> 00:05:36,031
when it's been an advantage be a Jew.

32
00:05:36,269 --> 00:05:38,499
But in the 'seventies,
to escape the Soviet Union,

33
00:05:38,738 --> 00:05:40,933
our family pretended to be Jewish.

34
00:05:41,174 --> 00:05:43,836
Little about my life has been
kosher ever since

35
00:05:44,077 --> 00:05:45,567
How's it going, brother?

36
00:05:46,579 --> 00:05:47,841
It's not.

37
00:05:48,081 --> 00:05:49,742
That's Vitaly, my younger brother.

38
00:05:49,982 --> 00:05:51,108
He was as lost as me.

39
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,409
He didn't know it yet.

40
00:05:52,652 --> 00:05:53,584
Yuri,

41
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,082
you're late.

42
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:01,926
My father took his assumed
identity to heart.

43
00:06:02,161 --> 00:06:04,391
He was more Jewish than most Jews.

44
00:06:04,630 --> 00:06:06,655
Which drove my Catholic mother crazy.

45
00:06:06,899 --> 00:06:07,797
How many times?

46
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:10,264
I can't eat shellfish.

47
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:11,026
It's treyf.

48
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,396
You're not Jewish.

49
00:06:12,638 --> 00:06:13,900
I like it.

50
00:06:14,941 --> 00:06:16,841
I like the hat.

51
00:06:17,076 --> 00:06:18,907
To remind us there is something...

52
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:20,305
above us.

53
00:06:21,347 --> 00:06:22,814
I like that.

54
00:06:25,518 --> 00:06:26,485
I'm going to temple.

55
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,515
You're not going to temple.

56
00:06:27,754 --> 00:06:29,688
You go to temple more than the rabbi.

57
00:06:29,922 --> 00:06:31,219
Get off my back, woman.

58
00:06:31,457 --> 00:06:33,618
God, will you ever wise up?

59
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,260
Yuri, don't forget to check

60
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,430
the specials at the Palace.

61
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:41,089
Growing up in Little Odessa,

62
00:06:41,334 --> 00:06:43,666
murder was everyday part of life.

63
00:06:43,903 --> 00:06:45,530
Russian mobsters had also
migrated

64
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,898
from the Soviet Union

65
00:06:47,140 --> 00:06:48,630
and when they came to America,

66
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:50,968
their baggage came with them.

67
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:53,645
There was always some gangster

68
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,313
getting whacked in my
neighborhood,

69
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,812
but I'd never seen it with my own eyes.

70
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:00,985
I had this knack of showing up
five minutes before something went down,

71
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,678
or five minutes after.

72
00:07:03,122 --> 00:07:04,521
Not that day.

73
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:29,905
It hit me.

74
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:31,047
It couldn't have hit me harder

75
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,343
if I was the one who'd been shot.

76
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,051
You go into the restaurant business...

77
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:38,519
because people are always going
to have to eat.

78
00:07:38,758 --> 00:07:40,453
That was the day I realized my destiny...

79
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,924
...lay in fulfilling another basic
human need.

80
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:50,067
The next Sabbath,
I went to temple with my father.

81
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:53,329
However, it wasn't God
I was trying to get close to.

82
00:07:53,573 --> 00:07:55,632
Eli, my eldest son, Yuri.

83
00:07:55,875 --> 00:07:57,570
My contact at synagogue landed me

84
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:01,769
my first Israeli-made Uzi
submachine guns.

85
00:08:05,451 --> 00:08:06,349
The first time you sell a gun...

86
00:08:06,586 --> 00:08:08,952
is a lot like the first time you have sex.

87
00:08:09,188 --> 00:08:11,281
You have absolutely no idea
what you're doing.

88
00:08:11,524 --> 00:08:14,049
But it is exciting and one way
or another,

89
00:08:14,293 --> 00:08:16,284
it's over way too fast.

90
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:20,196
Gentlemen.

91
00:08:20,633 --> 00:08:22,658
The new Uzi machine pistol.

92
00:08:22,902 --> 00:08:24,426
Big firepower in a small package.

93
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,501
This little baby uses 9 mm hollow points.

94
00:08:26,739 --> 00:08:28,798
Twenty twenty-five round extendable mags...

95
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,303
...rear-flip adjustable sights.

96
00:08:30,543 --> 00:08:32,511
Silencer comes standard.
Excellent recoil reduction.

97
00:08:32,745 --> 00:08:34,042
Muzzle jump reduced forty percent.

98
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,872
Sixty percent improved noise
suppression.

99
00:08:36,115 --> 00:08:37,742
You could pump a mag into me

100
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:39,178
right now

101
00:08:39,418 --> 00:08:41,443
and never wake the guy
in the next room.

102
00:08:43,222 --> 00:08:44,189
Of course, that would eliminate your

103
00:08:44,423 --> 00:08:46,584
opportunity for repeat business.

104
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:49,227
I did have a natural instinct

105
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:51,123
for smuggling contraband.

106
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:53,195
Fortunately, back then a video camera

107
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:55,696
was a big as a bazooka

108
00:09:03,309 --> 00:09:04,867
Here I'd been running away from violence

109
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:08,444
my whole life, and I should've
run towards it.

110
00:09:09,015 --> 00:09:10,448
It's in our nature.

111
00:09:10,683 --> 00:09:12,150
The earliest human skeletons had

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,819
spearheads in their rib cages.

113
00:09:26,365 --> 00:09:27,662
Where have you been?

114
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,367
What if we had a customer?

115
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,331
God bless America.

116
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,424
Beware of the dog?
You don't have a dog.

117
00:09:56,662 --> 00:09:57,594
Are you trying to scare people?

118
00:09:57,830 --> 00:09:59,297
No, it's to scare me.

119
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,029
Remind me to be aware of the dog in me.

120
00:10:02,668 --> 00:10:04,431
The dog wants to fuck everything
that moves

121
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,831
Wants to fight and kill weaker dogs.

122
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,735
I guess it's to remind me to be
more human.

123
00:10:09,976 --> 00:10:12,809
Isn't being a dog part of being human?

124
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,708
What if that's the best part of you?
The dog part.

125
00:10:16,949 --> 00:10:19,850
What if you're really just a
two-legged dog?

126
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,452
You need to see somebody.

127
00:10:23,689 --> 00:10:25,122
Stinks in here.

128
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,292
I'd always wanted to do something
big with my life

129
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:30,427
I just didn't know what.

130
00:10:30,663 --> 00:10:31,652
Anyhow, I figured,

131
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:33,524
if I was going into the gun trade,

132
00:10:33,766 --> 00:10:35,358
I was going aim high.

133
00:10:35,601 --> 00:10:36,659
Vitaly, stop fucking around.

134
00:10:36,902 --> 00:10:38,665
I want to talk to you.

135
00:10:42,341 --> 00:10:44,309
You read the newspapers, Vit?

136
00:10:44,543 --> 00:10:47,478
Newspaper? It's always the same.

137
00:10:47,713 --> 00:10:48,839
You're right.

138
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,946
Every day there's people shooting
each other.

139
00:10:51,183 --> 00:10:53,174
You know what I do when I see that?

140
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:54,613
I look to see what guns they're using

141
00:10:54,854 --> 00:10:56,845
and I think to myself, why not my guns?

142
00:10:57,089 --> 00:10:58,147
What, are you opening a gun shop?

143
00:10:58,391 --> 00:11:01,155
Already more of those in than
McDonald's.

144
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:03,089
Even with all the gangsters around here,

145
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,796
the margins are too low.

146
00:11:05,031 --> 00:11:07,556
You've figured the margins?
Sure.

147
00:11:08,567 --> 00:11:10,296
Forget gang wars.

148
00:11:10,536 --> 00:11:12,504
The real money is in actual wars.

149
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,365
Between countries.

150
00:11:14,607 --> 00:11:17,508
Yuri, what the fuck do you know
about guns?

151
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,768
I know which end I'd rather be on.

152
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:23,775
I made the first sale.

153
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,145
We're already in business.

154
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,947
Whoa, whoa. We?

155
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,918
I need a partner.

156
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:36,855
I don't know,

157
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:38,586
I don't know, Yuri. I don't know.

158
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,458
Vitaly, I've tasted your borscht.

159
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,598
You're no fucking chef.

160
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:42,892
I can eat in the restaurant for free

161
00:11:43,135 --> 00:11:45,035
and I still don't eat there.

162
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:46,295
Fuck you.

163
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,064
We're doing nothing with our lives.

164
00:11:50,576 --> 00:11:53,807
I mean, this is shit!

165
00:11:54,046 --> 00:11:55,445
This is shit!

166
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,911
It's true.

167
00:11:59,151 --> 00:12:01,847
But maybe doing nothing's
better than doing this.

168
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,119
I need you.

169
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,517
Brothers in arms.

170
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,697
Brothers in arms.

171
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,849
Sir, may I interest you in the

172
00:12:33,085 --> 00:12:35,645
shoulder-fired SA-7
surface-to-air missiles?

173
00:12:35,888 --> 00:12:37,014
The older Chinese model.

174
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,280
Not so effective against

175
00:12:38,524 --> 00:12:40,355
modern military aircraft. But deadly...

176
00:12:40,593 --> 00:12:42,117
if used against a commercial airliner.

177
00:12:42,361 --> 00:12:44,625
I'm giving them away at 8-50.

178
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,261
In the '80s, and the Cold War was
far from thawed

179
00:12:49,502 --> 00:12:51,800
Most of the deals were
government-to-government.

180
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:53,299
It was a mostly private club...

181
00:12:53,539 --> 00:12:55,871
...with a lifetime club president.

182
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,106
That's him.
The big shot?

183
00:12:59,345 --> 00:13:01,939
Simeon Weisz, Angola,
Mozambique,

184
00:13:02,181 --> 00:13:04,615
those Exocet missiles
in the Falklands.

185
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:07,341
He was selling guns before
there was gunpowder.

186
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:09,680
Be right back.

187
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:15,258
Mr. Weisz? Mr. Weisz!

188
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:17,922
It's okay, they're talking.

189
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:19,657
May I help?

190
00:13:19,899 --> 00:13:21,457
A mutual friend, Eli Kurtzman

191
00:13:21,700 --> 00:13:22,428
from Brighton Beach,

192
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,863
import/export said to contact you.

193
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:26,366
I have a business proposal

194
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:28,903
and I thought perhaps we could
discuss it.

195
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,008
I don't think you and I are
in the same business.

196
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:34,975
You think I just sell guns,
don't you?

197
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:36,704
I don't. I take sides.

198
00:13:36,949 --> 00:13:40,908
But in the Iran-Iraq war
you sold guns to both sides.

199
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:44,816
Did you ever consider that
I wanted both sides to lose?

200
00:13:45,758 --> 00:13:49,888
Bullets change governments far
surer than votes.

201
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:52,393
You're in the wrong place,
my young friend.

202
00:13:52,631 --> 00:13:54,656
This is no place for amateurs.

203
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,501
Motherfucker.

204
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,399
Curious how you always revert to
your native tongue

205
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:04,200
in moments of extreme anger.

206
00:14:04,443 --> 00:14:05,933
And ecstasy.

207
00:14:08,314 --> 00:14:11,477
Oh God... Oh, God!

208
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:21,483
You are beautiful.

209
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,752
What's your name again?

210
00:14:29,735 --> 00:14:31,293
The only option for Vitaly and me

211
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:33,767
was under-the-counter gunrunning.

212
00:14:34,173 --> 00:14:35,572
Beirut, Lebanon - 1984

213
00:14:35,808 --> 00:14:37,241
I got my first break in Lebanon

214
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:39,774
after the suicide bombing.

215
00:14:41,814 --> 00:14:45,045
But I wasn't the only local kid
making good.

216
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:50,517
When the United States leaves a war zone...

217
00:14:50,756 --> 00:14:53,554
they generally don't take
their munitions.

218
00:14:53,792 --> 00:14:54,690
It costs more to bring it back

219
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:56,895
than to buy new stock.

220
00:14:57,263 --> 00:15:00,699
So, we sell by the kilo.

221
00:15:00,933 --> 00:15:01,763
They're secondhand weapons,

222
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,593
but they're still okay.

223
00:15:06,972 --> 00:15:08,462
How many kilos would you like?

224
00:15:08,707 --> 00:15:09,571
Five thousand.

225
00:15:09,808 --> 00:15:12,072
I had a flair for languages...

226
00:15:12,311 --> 00:15:15,075
...but I soon discovered that what
talks best is dollars, dinars...

227
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:18,806
...drachmas, rubles, rupees, and
pounds-fucking-sterling.

228
00:15:19,051 --> 00:15:21,849
Of course, the U.S. Army got a
piece of the action.

229
00:15:22,087 --> 00:15:25,454
Army salaries were no better then
than they are today.

230
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:26,419
And some of the brass,

231
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:28,422
like Lieutenant Colonel Southern...

232
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:31,323
needed to raise money for their
own private wars.

233
00:15:31,563 --> 00:15:33,497
Good to make your acquaintance.

234
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:35,800
This is bullshit money,

235
00:15:36,035 --> 00:15:38,026
This is small-fucking-potatoes.

236
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,532
What do you want to do, go more legit?

237
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:41,467
No, more illegal.

238
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:43,071
What I would give right now

239
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:45,709
for cabbage and potatoes.

240
00:16:12,771 --> 00:16:14,238
It's not our fight.

241
00:16:15,107 --> 00:16:16,472
Vit, come on!

242
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,875
Let's go. Come on.

243
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:33,658
Selling guns is like selling
vacuum cleaners.

244
00:16:33,892 --> 00:16:34,517
You make calls,

245
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:35,488
pound the pavement,

246
00:16:35,728 --> 00:16:36,524
take orders.

247
00:16:36,762 --> 00:16:39,026
I was an equal opportunity
merchant of death.

248
00:16:39,264 --> 00:16:42,131
I supplied every army but the
Salvation Army.

249
00:16:44,770 --> 00:16:47,739
I sold Israeli-made Uzis to Muslims.

250
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,104
I sold communist-made bullets
to fascists.

251
00:16:56,615 --> 00:16:58,640
I hope you're not thinking of
selling these, Mr. Orlov.

252
00:16:58,884 --> 00:17:00,181
Personal use.

253
00:17:00,419 --> 00:17:01,181
Personal use.

254
00:17:01,420 --> 00:17:03,149
There's a hundred thousand
bullets here.

255
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,084
I'm kind of trigger happy.

256
00:17:05,324 --> 00:17:06,552
Trigger happy?

257
00:17:12,431 --> 00:17:14,194
I even shipped cargo to Afghanistan

258
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:17,197
when they were still fighting my
fellow Soviets.

259
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,404
I never sold to Osama Bin Laden.

260
00:17:19,638 --> 00:17:20,866
Not on any moral grounds.

261
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:24,007
Back then, he was always
bouncing checks.

262
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:34,180
By the mid-'80s...

263
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,081
my weapons were represented in eight...

264
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,881
...of the world's top ten war zones.

265
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,820
There's no problem leading a double life.

266
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,420
It's the triple and quadruple lives

267
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:12,919
that get you in the end.

268
00:18:13,158 --> 00:18:15,752
Back then, I carried a... French,
British, Israeli,

269
00:18:15,994 --> 00:18:17,086
and Ukrainian passport...

270
00:18:17,329 --> 00:18:18,887
...and a student visa for the U.S.,

271
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,860
but... that's another story.

272
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,125
I also packed six different briefcases...

273
00:18:23,368 --> 00:18:25,063
...depending on who I was that day

274
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,431
and the region of the world I was visiting.

275
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:32,007
North of Cartagena, Colombia - 1989

276
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,168
Without operations like mine,

277
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,347
would be impossible for certain
countries

278
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,050
to conduct a respectable war.

279
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,478
I was able to navigate around those

280
00:18:40,719 --> 00:18:43,415
inconvenient little arms embargoes.

281
00:18:43,655 --> 00:18:45,623
There are three basic types
of arms deal.

282
00:18:45,858 --> 00:18:46,756
White, being legal.

283
00:18:46,992 --> 00:18:48,254
Black, being illegal,

284
00:18:48,494 --> 00:18:51,429
and my personal favorite color, gray.

285
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,756
Sometimes I made the deal
so convoluted...

286
00:18:53,999 --> 00:18:55,330
it was hard for me to work out

287
00:18:55,567 --> 00:18:56,795
if they were on the level.

288
00:18:57,035 --> 00:18:58,127
To keep authorities in the dark

289
00:18:58,370 --> 00:19:00,099
I often spoke in code.

290
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:01,704
Rocket launchers were "mothers."

291
00:19:01,940 --> 00:19:03,202
The rockets, "children."

292
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:07,105
The AK-47 assault rifle was
the "Angel King."

293
00:19:07,346 --> 00:19:12,340
It's Yuri... Yeah. Well, Raoul...

294
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:16,020
Raoul, the Angel King will arrive tomorrow.

295
00:19:17,055 --> 00:19:19,046
Hallelujah to you, too.

296
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,521
The point is, if I've done my job right

297
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,254
an arms embargo should be
practically impossible to enforce.

298
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,022
What?

299
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,031
Okay, just slow the fuck down.

300
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:32,567
I can't understand you.

301
00:19:32,804 --> 00:19:35,637
Wha-What do you mean, tipped off?

302
00:19:35,874 --> 00:19:38,434
They know where we are?
Well, where are they?

303
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,202
Well, how long have I got?
Not long?

304
00:19:41,446 --> 00:19:43,175
What does that mean? Shit!

305
00:19:43,415 --> 00:19:44,973
Do we try to lose them?
On this?

306
00:19:45,217 --> 00:19:46,582
Yuri, we have to get off this thing.

307
00:19:46,818 --> 00:19:48,183
No. No one's going anywhere.

308
00:19:48,420 --> 00:19:50,980
Slow, dead slow. Buy me time.

309
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,084
Yeah, it's Yuri.

310
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,352
Get that fucking rag down!

311
00:19:57,596 --> 00:19:59,188
I need another handle for this tub.

312
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,160
Something in our weight class.

313
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:02,591
You! Over the side.

314
00:20:02,834 --> 00:20:05,667
We're changing the name. Now!

315
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:08,640
Yes, it's got to check out.

316
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:09,863
The way I look at it,

317
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:11,336
what's in a name?

318
00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:12,836
Have you got a shorter name?

319
00:20:13,078 --> 00:20:16,104
I'd often changed the registration
of a ship or a plane...

320
00:20:16,348 --> 00:20:18,475
...but never on such short notice.

321
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:23,285
Damn! They're hauling.

322
00:20:24,790 --> 00:20:27,452
What? Kono? How do you spell
that?

323
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:29,354
K-O-N-O, okay, well, that's good.

324
00:20:29,595 --> 00:20:32,530
Kono, K-O-N-O.

325
00:20:32,764 --> 00:20:34,459
What are we flying? Dutch? Got it.

326
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,497
Vit, get me a Dutch flag, will you?

327
00:20:47,512 --> 00:20:50,447
Faster! Or I'll send your ass in!

328
00:20:50,682 --> 00:20:52,547
Yuri, I don't have Dutch!
What?

329
00:20:52,784 --> 00:20:54,445
I've got Belgian.
What the fuck use is that?

330
00:20:54,686 --> 00:20:55,516
He's painting a name registered

331
00:20:55,754 --> 00:20:57,483
in the fucking Netherlands.

332
00:20:58,924 --> 00:21:01,051
I've got a French flag.
So?

333
00:21:01,293 --> 00:21:02,760
Turn it sideways...

334
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,588
...it's Dutch.

335
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:07,565
That's why you're my brother.

336
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:31,186
All right, good!

337
00:21:31,423 --> 00:21:33,391
Everybody look innocent now.

338
00:21:42,668 --> 00:21:45,136
They say every man has his price.

339
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:46,894
But not every man gets it.

340
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:49,835
Interpol Agent Jack Valentine
couldn't be bought.

341
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,542
At least, not with money.

342
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:55,008
For Jack, glory was the prize.

343
00:21:55,247 --> 00:21:57,875
Yeah, it's the Kono;
it's not the Kristol.

344
00:21:58,116 --> 00:22:00,277
Kono, K-O-N-O.

345
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,781
It's clean, sir.

346
00:22:02,020 --> 00:22:03,146
It's clean?

347
00:22:03,388 --> 00:22:05,151
It sure doesn't look clean.

348
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:06,755
I'm going to go aboard.

349
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,654
Phone in a sighting of the
Kristol south of Aruba.

350
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:19,535
Even when I was up against an
overzealous agent...

351
00:22:19,771 --> 00:22:23,070
...I had a number of methods for
discouraging a search.

352
00:22:23,308 --> 00:22:25,276
I routinely mislabeled my arms shipments

353
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:26,909
"Farm Machinery."

354
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:29,613
And I have yet to meet the lowly
paid customs official...

355
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:30,837
...who will open a container...

356
00:22:31,083 --> 00:22:32,846
...marked "Radioactive Waste"

357
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,110
to verify its contents.

358
00:22:35,354 --> 00:22:37,413
But my personal favorite is
the unique combination...

359
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,251
of week-old potatoes and tropical heat.

360
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,034
Smells.

361
00:22:59,511 --> 00:23:02,241
Sir, Sighting of the Kristol, due north.

362
00:23:03,148 --> 00:23:05,480
Most importantly, I kept a number
of intelligence people

363
00:23:05,717 --> 00:23:07,514
on the payroll to supply their colleagues

364
00:23:07,753 --> 00:23:09,948
with counterintelligence.

365
00:23:10,188 --> 00:23:11,212
Let's go.

366
00:23:23,235 --> 00:23:24,930
The second rule of gunrunning is:

367
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:28,196
Always ensure you have a
foolproof way to get paid.

368
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,873
Preferably in advance...

369
00:23:30,108 --> 00:23:32,008
ideally to an off-shore account.

370
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:34,769
That's why I chose my customers
so carefully.

371
00:23:35,013 --> 00:23:37,447
Say what you like about warlords
and dictators...

372
00:23:37,682 --> 00:23:40,173
they tend to have a highly
developed sense of order.

373
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,512
They always pay their bills on time.

374
00:23:42,754 --> 00:23:44,244
What is this?

375
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,888
Six kilos of pure.

376
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:49,753
I can't hand this to my fucking bank

377
00:23:49,995 --> 00:23:51,690
teller at Chase Manhattan.

378
00:23:52,397 --> 00:23:56,163
Listen, asshole, you should be
thanking me.

379
00:23:56,401 --> 00:23:58,767
Have you checked the street price today?

380
00:23:59,004 --> 00:24:02,167
With the seizures at the border last week,

381
00:24:02,407 --> 00:24:04,272
it's jumped thirty percent.

382
00:24:04,509 --> 00:24:05,533
Whoa... whoa-whoa!

383
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:09,213
I sell guns. I don't sell drugs.

384
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,415
Diversify.

385
00:24:10,649 --> 00:24:11,911
I've got standards.

386
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:14,641
You don't pay, you don't play.

387
00:24:14,886 --> 00:24:16,114
Fuck you!

388
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,185
What are you doing?
Fuck you!

389
00:24:18,423 --> 00:24:18,946
Fuck you!

390
00:24:19,191 --> 00:24:20,658
No, you don't fuck him.

391
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:23,190
We can work something out.

392
00:24:24,896 --> 00:24:26,056
No, Vit!

393
00:24:26,298 --> 00:24:28,266
We have a deal!

394
00:24:30,569 --> 00:24:33,629
The first and most important
rule of gunrunning...

395
00:24:33,872 --> 00:24:36,739
is never get shot with your own
merchandise.

396
00:24:37,642 --> 00:24:38,870
Are you okay?

397
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,171
I think so.

398
00:24:41,980 --> 00:24:43,607
So what do we do now?

399
00:24:44,249 --> 00:24:45,910
Let's celebrate.

400
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:11,739
That narco guerilla had his facts right.

401
00:25:11,977 --> 00:25:14,002
After shipping it stateside,
the return on that blow

402
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,146
netted me a healthy profit.

403
00:25:16,381 --> 00:25:17,439
It would have been even better,

404
00:25:17,682 --> 00:25:20,082
except one kilo never made it back.

405
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:21,285
Vitaly?

406
00:25:22,754 --> 00:25:24,119
Vit!

407
00:25:27,559 --> 00:25:29,288
To this day I don't know what Vitaly...

408
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:30,961
...was running away from.

409
00:25:31,196 --> 00:25:32,959
Maybe just from Vitaly.

410
00:25:34,199 --> 00:25:36,394
I found him twelve days,
two thousand miles,

411
00:25:36,635 --> 00:25:37,897
and one hundred and fifty grams later

412
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,104
in a Bolivian boarding house.

413
00:25:44,142 --> 00:25:47,441
Of course, my dream girl
had gone there before me.

414
00:25:54,486 --> 00:25:55,578
Vit!

415
00:26:05,597 --> 00:26:06,825
Come on!

416
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,545
Fuck, Yuri's back.

417
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,683
It's my brother, Yuri.

418
00:26:27,185 --> 00:26:28,675
He's my big brother.

419
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:32,379
What the fuck is that?

420
00:26:32,624 --> 00:26:33,921
Ukraine.

421
00:26:34,159 --> 00:26:36,354
I was young, but I remember.

422
00:26:36,728 --> 00:26:39,458
Look... I start in Odessa, right?

423
00:26:39,698 --> 00:26:42,690
And then I work my way to the
Crimean

424
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:45,061
You'll be dead before you fucking
reach Kiev!

425
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:46,099
We're going home. Come on,

426
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:49,432
You fuck! You fucking fuck!

427
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:51,574
You fucking fuck...

428
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,937
What the fuck is your problem?

429
00:27:00,652 --> 00:27:03,018
Come on, Vit.

430
00:27:03,254 --> 00:27:04,050
J.F.K. Airport, New York - 1989

431
00:27:04,289 --> 00:27:06,814
Yuri, it's so nice to be home.
Yeah, good work.

432
00:27:07,058 --> 00:27:08,252
We're gonna get you home.

433
00:27:08,493 --> 00:27:09,517
Come on.

434
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:14,726
St. Francis Rehabilitation Center

435
00:27:20,505 --> 00:27:22,097
Get out of the car.

436
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,146
Vitaly, I need you to get out of the car.

437
00:27:30,749 --> 00:27:32,910
I promised our parents.

438
00:27:34,419 --> 00:27:35,283
Please.

439
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,748
Vitaly, you're going to have a great time.

440
00:27:36,988 --> 00:27:37,750
This is a top place.

441
00:27:37,989 --> 00:27:39,752
Two Ford models checked in last week.

442
00:27:39,991 --> 00:27:41,652
And that cute weather girl's been
here since July.

443
00:27:41,893 --> 00:27:43,258
Please.

444
00:27:45,330 --> 00:27:46,957
Please, Yuri.

445
00:28:04,616 --> 00:28:06,083
You're a good brother.

446
00:28:09,287 --> 00:28:10,515
You're a good brother, Yuri.

447
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:11,687
Okay. All right.

448
00:28:11,923 --> 00:28:12,685
Good brother.

449
00:28:12,924 --> 00:28:14,585
All right. Get out of the car.

450
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:15,884
Okay

451
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,720
Get out of the car.

452
00:28:25,503 --> 00:28:27,971
From then on I was a one-man operation.

453
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,503
I never understood what separated...

454
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,505
the recreational drug user from
the habitual.

455
00:28:32,744 --> 00:28:33,676
But for the grace of God...

456
00:28:33,912 --> 00:28:35,106
it could've been me snorting lines

457
00:28:35,346 --> 00:28:37,371
as long as the Belt Parkway.

458
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:39,947
However, I wasn't entirely free

459
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:42,085
of the grip of addiction myself.

460
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:43,617
There she was again.

461
00:28:43,855 --> 00:28:45,447
Ava Fontaine.

462
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,952
In my neighborhood they say,

463
00:28:47,192 --> 00:28:48,454
"The good get out."

464
00:28:48,693 --> 00:28:51,059
In our own ways, we'd both
conquered the world.

465
00:28:51,796 --> 00:28:56,460
St. Barts, French Caribbean - 1989

466
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,443
You can't force somebody to
fall in love with you.

467
00:29:10,682 --> 00:29:12,877
But you can definitely improve your odds.

468
00:29:14,018 --> 00:29:16,748
It cost me 20 grand to book he
for a fake photo shoot.

469
00:29:16,988 --> 00:29:19,286
Another twelve to buy out the hotel.

470
00:30:02,867 --> 00:30:04,562
Popular hotel, huh?

471
00:30:08,473 --> 00:30:10,668
Ava Fontaine.
Yuri Orlov.

472
00:30:11,142 --> 00:30:12,370
What brings you to St. Barts?

473
00:30:12,610 --> 00:30:13,406
Photo shoot.

474
00:30:13,645 --> 00:30:15,203
At least, that was the plan.

475
00:30:15,446 --> 00:30:17,846
I guess the photographer got
stuck in Miami.

476
00:30:18,082 --> 00:30:20,812
Hurricane. Though there's nothing
on the news.

477
00:30:21,419 --> 00:30:24,855
Those things can come out of nowhere.

478
00:30:25,356 --> 00:30:26,880
So... the job's been cancelled,

479
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:27,716
and wouldn't you know it,

480
00:30:27,959 --> 00:30:30,154
there's no flight to New York until Tuesday.

481
00:30:30,395 --> 00:30:31,487
You can hitch a ride with me if you like.

482
00:30:31,729 --> 00:30:33,390
I'm leaving tomorrow.

483
00:30:33,631 --> 00:30:37,658
Meanwhile, why don't I take your picture?

484
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,594
In my experience,

485
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:41,271
some of the most successful
relationships...

486
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,633
are based on lies and deceit.

487
00:30:43,875 --> 00:30:45,604
Since that's where they usually
end up anyway...

488
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,607
it's a logical place to start.

489
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,746
Right there. Hold it there.

490
00:30:49,981 --> 00:30:51,710
Oh, my God!

491
00:30:55,086 --> 00:30:58,078
I nearly went broke trying to
convince her I was anything but.

492
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,457
I knew Ava was not the kind of woman

493
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,388
to be seduced by a ride in a private jet

494
00:31:03,628 --> 00:31:05,289
unless you owned the jet.

495
00:31:05,997 --> 00:31:07,225
This is your plane?

496
00:31:07,465 --> 00:31:09,160
That is my name.

497
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,594
Of course, I was lying.

498
00:31:10,835 --> 00:31:12,097
The plane was rented, like the car

499
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,305
and even the suit I was standing in

500
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:15,130
At the last minute,

501
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:17,432
I'd bribed the crew for the paint job.

502
00:31:17,675 --> 00:31:19,575
Luckily, by the time we landed...

503
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:22,575
Ava wasn't looking anywhere
but in my eyes.

504
00:31:23,581 --> 00:31:25,674
I had no idea.

505
00:31:26,551 --> 00:31:28,576
I'm sorry I didn't recognize you.

506
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,812
Don't apologize. I put clothes on
for a living.

507
00:31:32,056 --> 00:31:33,455
A least you're not taking them off.

508
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:34,453
I would be, if half the...

509
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,523
...photographers had their way.

510
00:31:36,961 --> 00:31:38,258
What about you?

511
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:39,793
I'm in transport.

512
00:31:40,031 --> 00:31:42,056
International air freight, mostly.

513
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:44,131
Business is good.

514
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:46,596
Where're you from?

515
00:31:46,838 --> 00:31:48,897
I was born in Ukraine,
but I grew up in Brooklyn.

516
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:49,799
No.

517
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:50,837
What, you too?

518
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:52,667
Williamsburg.

519
00:31:56,581 --> 00:31:58,242
Here's to a hurricane.

520
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:01,582
Without it, I never would have met you.

521
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,287
This is no accident, is it, Yuri?

522
00:32:09,794 --> 00:32:11,989
It feels like fate.

523
00:32:12,497 --> 00:32:14,328
I don't believe in fate.

524
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,500
What do you believe in?

525
00:32:59,344 --> 00:33:01,005
Is that a view, or is that a view?

526
00:33:01,245 --> 00:33:02,872
That's a view.

527
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:16,325
Thank you. Thank you all.

528
00:33:20,198 --> 00:33:21,165
Congratulations.

529
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:22,195
Congratulations.

530
00:33:22,433 --> 00:33:23,400
Thanks.

531
00:33:25,737 --> 00:33:27,466
Always remember, son...

532
00:33:27,705 --> 00:33:29,002
There is something above you.

533
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:30,332
Sure, Dad.

534
00:33:30,575 --> 00:33:33,339
A forty-thousand-dollar crystal chandelier.

535
00:33:35,780 --> 00:33:38,772
Make yourselves at home. Go!

536
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:40,143
Go!

537
00:33:54,332 --> 00:33:57,358
I'm sorry. Today must be tough.

538
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,467
It'd be nice to have a couple
more guests

539
00:33:59,704 --> 00:34:01,365
from my side of the family.

540
00:34:02,073 --> 00:34:03,870
I'm sure they're watching right now.

541
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,440
Thank you.

542
00:34:06,677 --> 00:34:08,542
But you don't believe that, Yuri...

543
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:10,407
...remember?

544
00:34:12,417 --> 00:34:14,180
I know you, Yuri.

545
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:17,684
I know you're not everything you seem.

546
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:21,521
Don't worry, I won't ask a lot of questions.

547
00:34:21,759 --> 00:34:23,522
I don't want to hear you lie.

548
00:34:24,729 --> 00:34:26,594
You take risks.

549
00:34:26,831 --> 00:34:31,598
Just promise me you won't risk us.

550
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:33,601
That's the trouble with falling in love

551
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:34,862
with a dream girl.

552
00:34:35,106 --> 00:34:37,404
They have a habit of becoming real.

553
00:34:42,747 --> 00:34:45,545
I've never been so glad to see Vitaly.

554
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:47,546
You're fucking beautiful!

555
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:50,053
Brother...

556
00:34:50,288 --> 00:34:51,346
Brother, thank you so much...

557
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:54,353
for giving me such a beautiful sister.

558
00:34:54,592 --> 00:34:57,083
He was out of rehab, and out of his mind.

559
00:34:57,328 --> 00:34:59,091
Dance! Dance! We have to dance!

560
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,059
All right, all right
It's a wedding, a celebration

561
00:35:01,299 --> 00:35:01,697
To Yuri!

562
00:35:01,933 --> 00:35:04,265
For once, he rescued me.

563
00:35:04,669 --> 00:35:06,728
New York - December 25, 1991

564
00:35:07,905 --> 00:35:09,736
I was still living way beyond my means.

565
00:35:09,974 --> 00:35:13,432
Mortgaged to the hilt, using one
credit card to pay another.

566
00:35:13,678 --> 00:35:15,077
Anything to keep Ava in the style to

567
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:17,577
which she had thanks largely to me

568
00:35:17,815 --> 00:35:18,747
become accustomed.

569
00:35:18,983 --> 00:35:20,041
Ava

570
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:21,808
Ava, this is too much.

571
00:35:22,053 --> 00:35:23,350
Yuri likes to spoil you.

572
00:35:23,588 --> 00:35:24,213
Then suddenly,

573
00:35:24,455 --> 00:35:26,150
all my Christmases came at once.

574
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:29,120
Nicki, you did it! Good boy!

575
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,251
That's my grandson!

576
00:35:31,496 --> 00:35:33,555
Yuri, don't you want to see what
your son is doing?

577
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:35,789
Whoever said it's better to give
than receive...

578
00:35:36,033 --> 00:35:38,228
...never got a Christmas present
like the one I got...

579
00:35:38,469 --> 00:35:41,336
in 1991 from Mikhail Gorbachev.

580
00:35:41,572 --> 00:35:42,561
What the hell's the matter?

581
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,399
It's over!

582
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,165
What's over?

583
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:47,536
The Cold-fucking-War!
The Soviet-fucking Union

584
00:35:47,778 --> 00:35:50,042
The Evil fucking-Empire!
Mikhail's saying no mas.

585
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:50,975
He's throwing in the towel.

586
00:35:51,215 --> 00:35:52,375
It's over!

587
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:57,651
Your son is walking.

588
00:35:57,889 --> 00:35:59,413
That's incredible, honey.

589
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:07,259
At least they'll get religious freedom.

590
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:08,891
Let's hope so.

591
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:11,758
I think I'll go back for a visit.

592
00:36:12,837 --> 00:36:14,998
Do you stay in touch with Uncle Dmitri?

593
00:36:18,743 --> 00:36:20,233
I'm not a fool, Yuri.

594
00:36:22,446 --> 00:36:25,847
I don't think you're going to
Odessa to sell Pepsi-Cola.

595
00:36:29,687 --> 00:36:32,212
Is this how you want to be remembered?

596
00:36:33,658 --> 00:36:35,421
I don't want to be remembered at all.

597
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,026
I'm being remembered,
it means I'm dead.

598
00:36:39,597 --> 00:36:41,724
Merry-fucking-Christmas!

599
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:44,433
Who is this, Vitaly?

600
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:45,494
I'm Angel.

601
00:36:45,736 --> 00:36:48,227
Her name really is Angel.

602
00:36:49,106 --> 00:36:50,630
She's a fairy.

603
00:36:53,177 --> 00:36:55,737
Let's put her on top of the
Christmas tree.

604
00:36:56,047 --> 00:36:57,275
Come on

605
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,448
I love you.

606
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:04,382
Come on.

607
00:37:04,622 --> 00:37:06,055
I love you all.

608
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:09,652
Take this.

609
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:29,302
I'm going back to Ukraine.

610
00:37:33,317 --> 00:37:34,648
I miss Odessa.

611
00:37:44,128 --> 00:37:45,095
I miss you.

612
00:37:45,329 --> 00:37:46,353
I miss you.

613
00:37:49,567 --> 00:37:52,536
Be careful, Yuri. Those things
you sell kill.

614
00:37:55,006 --> 00:37:56,166
Inside.

615
00:37:58,909 --> 00:38:00,206
You're high.

616
00:38:01,779 --> 00:38:03,007
That's true.

617
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,815
Hello, Christian.

618
00:38:11,789 --> 00:38:14,883
Odessa, Ukraine - 1992

619
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,887
During the Cold War, the Red
Army stationed nearly

620
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,596
one million troops in Ukraine...

621
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:23,095
because of its strategic military importance.

622
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,699
The day after The Wall came down...

623
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:26,459
the paychecks stopped coming.

624
00:38:26,704 --> 00:38:28,228
Your papers.

625
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:29,905
There's nothing better for an arms dealer...

626
00:38:30,141 --> 00:38:31,904
combination of disgruntled soldiers

627
00:38:32,143 --> 00:38:34,771
and warehouses full of weapons.

628
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:36,307
Welcome.

629
00:38:37,715 --> 00:38:39,774
I was hoping Major General Dmitri Volkoff

630
00:38:40,017 --> 00:38:41,541
would open a lot of armory doors

631
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,686
in a lot of military bases.

632
00:38:43,921 --> 00:38:45,889
For a start, he was family.

633
00:38:46,123 --> 00:38:48,353
He was a highly decorated hero
of the Red Army,

634
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,083
and he was almost permanently
shit-faced

635
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,992
I can't just sell you government
property, Yuri.

636
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,901
I have to report.

637
00:38:58,135 --> 00:39:01,127
Report to who? Moscow?

638
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:03,899
As of last week

639
00:39:04,141 --> 00:39:05,802
Moscow's in a foreign country.

640
00:39:06,043 --> 00:39:07,203
New flag, new boss.

641
00:39:07,445 --> 00:39:09,208
There is no new boss yet.

642
00:39:09,447 --> 00:39:11,074
They're all too busy squabbling over

643
00:39:11,315 --> 00:39:13,476
who's gonna get the presidential
holiday home

644
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,015
at the Black Sea.

645
00:39:15,252 --> 00:39:16,685
It's beautiful.

646
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:18,454
The ones who know don't care any more

647
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,486
and the ones who care don't know.

648
00:39:24,929 --> 00:39:26,556
Show me your inventory.

649
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,675
Those 45 years of mutual hatred

650
00:39:39,910 --> 00:39:40,968
between the East and the West...

651
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:42,645
had generated the highest weapons

652
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:44,438
buildup in history.

653
00:39:44,682 --> 00:39:45,444
The Soviets had guns

654
00:39:45,683 --> 00:39:47,116
coming out of the demon hole.

655
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:50,752
Huge stockpiles, and now no enemy.

656
00:39:51,589 --> 00:39:54,319
How many Kalashnikovs do you have?

657
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,422
Forty thousand.

658
00:39:58,462 --> 00:39:59,986
Is that a four?

659
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,528
It doesn't look like a four to me.

660
00:40:01,766 --> 00:40:03,961
It's more like a one.

661
00:40:04,201 --> 00:40:05,259
No, it's a four.

662
00:40:05,503 --> 00:40:06,663
It's whatever we say it is.

663
00:40:06,904 --> 00:40:09,236
Because no one else will know
the difference?

664
00:40:12,076 --> 00:40:16,035
Ten thousand Kalashnikovs for
a Your stocks are battalion.

665
00:40:16,280 --> 00:40:18,874
Your stocks are dangerously
depleted, Dmitri.

666
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:21,846
You should order more from the factory.

667
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:24,281
Someone will work it out.

668
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:26,754
What happens then?

669
00:40:26,991 --> 00:40:28,322
We'll cut them in.

670
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,260
The end of the Cold War

671
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:35,192
was the beginning of the hottest
time in arms dealing.

672
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:37,560
The arms bazaar was open.

673
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:40,328
Guided missiles, unguided missiles.

674
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:41,538
Mortars, mines,

675
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:43,364
armored personnel carriers.

676
00:40:43,607 --> 00:40:45,234
Whole tank divisions.

677
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,902
I'll tell you what I'll do.

678
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,510
Buy six, you get one free.

679
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,881
I even landed a squadron of
helicopter gunships.

680
00:41:06,430 --> 00:41:08,728
The most sophisticated fighting
machines...

681
00:41:08,966 --> 00:41:11,730
built for a war with America that
never happened.

682
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:14,870
Son, get off there before you get hurt.

683
00:41:15,105 --> 00:41:17,369
I can take it apart with my eyes closed.

684
00:41:17,608 --> 00:41:18,302
Thanks to me,

685
00:41:18,542 --> 00:41:21,602
they'd finally get to fire a shot in anger.

686
00:41:29,253 --> 00:41:30,880
I have a feeling it wasn't exactly

687
00:41:31,121 --> 00:41:32,850
what Comrade Lenin had in mind

688
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:36,389
when he advocated the
redistribution of wealth.

689
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:37,559
But I wasn't the only one

690
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:40,593
offering a crash course in capitalism.

691
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,133
I had rivals.

692
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:45,494
Inform your commanding officer

693
00:41:45,736 --> 00:41:48,170
that Simeon Weisz is here to meet him.

694
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:52,835
You don't know who I am, do you?

695
00:41:53,077 --> 00:41:55,136
I don't give a fuck who you are.

696
00:42:05,222 --> 00:42:06,314
You're late.

697
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:09,218
So it appears.

698
00:42:21,939 --> 00:42:23,065
Thank you.

699
00:42:23,541 --> 00:42:24,974
My pleasure.

700
00:42:25,209 --> 00:42:26,767
You sell guns?

701
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,077
Maybe you'd like to come to my room

702
00:42:30,314 --> 00:42:34,307
and I'll show you my... cannon.

703
00:42:39,056 --> 00:42:40,353
You look a little lost, Simeon.

704
00:42:40,591 --> 00:42:42,650
Is the world changing too fast?

705
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:44,292
I'm here, aren't I?

706
00:42:44,528 --> 00:42:45,961
Not all of you, I think.

707
00:42:46,196 --> 00:42:48,426
You've gotten so rich selling for the CIA

708
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:50,156
you can't seem to get that ideology

709
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:51,732
completely out of your head.

710
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:54,062
Oh, the Cold War had its uses.

711
00:42:55,105 --> 00:42:57,096
Kept the tensions frozen.

712
00:42:58,108 --> 00:43:00,167
Now it's harder to determine

713
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:01,673
which side one's on.

714
00:43:01,912 --> 00:43:03,675
Things have become more complicated.

715
00:43:03,914 --> 00:43:05,905
No, it's gotten simpler.

716
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:09,210
There's no place in gunrunning
for politics anymore,

717
00:43:09,453 --> 00:43:11,751
I sell to leftists and rightists.

718
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:12,956
I sell to pacifists,

719
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:15,454
but they're not the most regular of
customers.

720
00:43:16,193 --> 00:43:17,683
Of course, you're not a true
internationalist...

721
00:43:17,928 --> 00:43:19,156
...until you've supplied weapons

722
00:43:19,396 --> 00:43:21,330
to kill your own countrymen.

723
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:27,497
This current state of chaos won't
last forever.

724
00:43:28,305 --> 00:43:29,863
There'll have to be order.

725
00:43:32,476 --> 00:43:35,138
Instead of cutting each other's throats,

726
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:36,869
it may be beneficial if we work together.

727
00:43:37,114 --> 00:43:38,513
What do you think?

728
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:42,852
What do I think?

729
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,982
I think you are the amateur now,

730
00:43:46,624 --> 00:43:48,524
and I think you should go with
your instincts.

731
00:43:48,759 --> 00:43:50,750
With your first instinct.

732
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:52,019
I'm the same man who was not

733
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:53,593
good enough for you before...

734
00:43:53,831 --> 00:43:57,198
and I'm just not good enough
for you now.

735
00:44:11,482 --> 00:44:14,815
The problem with gunrunners
going to war

736
00:44:15,486 --> 00:44:18,387
is that there's no shortage of ammunition.

737
00:44:20,991 --> 00:44:22,015
This was the chaos

738
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:24,819
that the Old Guard had always feared.

739
00:44:25,062 --> 00:44:26,051
As far as they were concerned,

740
00:44:26,296 --> 00:44:28,526
I was giving arms dealers a bad name.

741
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:32,133
But they could hardly report me
to the Better Business Bureau.

742
00:44:33,904 --> 00:44:35,997
And Ukraine wasn't the only former state...

743
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,300
with an unpaid army and stockpiles of guns.

744
00:44:39,543 --> 00:44:44,139
There was Bulgaria, Hungary,
Poland, Belarus...

745
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:46,508
all there for the taking.

746
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,251
Of all the weapons in the vast
Soviet arsenal...

747
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:56,789
nothing was more profitable than
Avtomat Kalashnikova,

748
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,619
model of 1947,

749
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:02,923
more commonly known as the
AK-47... or kalashnikov.

750
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:05,829
It's the world's most popular
assault rifle

751
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,970
a weapon all fighters love.

752
00:45:08,205 --> 00:45:09,536
An elegantly simple nine-pound

753
00:45:09,773 --> 00:45:12,367
amalgamation of forged steel
and plywood.

754
00:45:12,609 --> 00:45:15,169
It doesn't break, jam, or overheat.

755
00:45:15,412 --> 00:45:16,936
It will shoot whether it's covered in mud

756
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,546
or filled with sand.

757
00:45:18,782 --> 00:45:21,216
It's so easy, even a child can use it

758
00:45:21,452 --> 00:45:22,282
and they do.

759
00:45:22,519 --> 00:45:24,316
The Soviets put the gun on a coin.

760
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:26,853
Mozambique put it on their flag.

761
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,285
Since the end of the Cold War,

762
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:29,583
the Kalashnikov has become the...

763
00:45:29,827 --> 00:45:32,125
...Russian people's greatest export.

764
00:45:32,362 --> 00:45:34,159
After that comes vodka, caviar,

765
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,127
and suicidal novelists.

766
00:45:36,967 --> 00:45:38,093
One thing's for sure

767
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:40,769
no one was lining up to buy their cars.

768
00:45:55,686 --> 00:45:57,950
What fucking documents?

769
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:04,586
You listen to me, Lieutenant.

770
00:46:04,828 --> 00:46:07,058
You keep them there.
For as long as you can!

771
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:08,821
Fight You listen to me, Lieutenant.

772
00:46:09,066 --> 00:46:10,294
To the death! Moscow is behind us!

773
00:46:10,534 --> 00:46:11,626
It's an order!

774
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:13,666
I thought you supposed watching
out for these people.

775
00:46:13,904 --> 00:46:15,269
How can I?

776
00:46:15,506 --> 00:46:17,133
You keep selling my helicopters.

777
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:19,035
You are too greedy, Yuri!

778
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,107
I can't hold him forever.

779
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:22,334
I've got paperwork.

780
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,103
Not for the gunships.

781
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,440
You know the penalty for

782
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:26,706
sanction-busting.

783
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:29,976
Selling the military helicopter
is a major violation.

784
00:46:30,220 --> 00:46:32,415
Military helicopter.

785
00:46:35,993 --> 00:46:37,927
It's not a military helicopter.

786
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:40,130
It's a rescue helicopter.

787
00:46:40,531 --> 00:46:42,158
Get to work, son.

788
00:46:42,666 --> 00:46:43,792
No problem.

789
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:46,762
The law's on our side.

790
00:47:06,423 --> 00:47:08,084
All right, let me see your papers.

791
00:47:09,259 --> 00:47:10,283
No-no-no, put that away.

792
00:47:10,527 --> 00:47:11,824
See your papers.

793
00:47:12,062 --> 00:47:13,154
Yuri Orlov.

794
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:16,327
Mr. Orlov, always In the wrong
place at the right time.

795
00:47:16,567 --> 00:47:18,364
What the fuck is this?

796
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:20,797
We've met before.

797
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:22,835
Off the coast Colombia.

798
00:47:23,073 --> 00:47:23,767
What was the name of that freighter?

799
00:47:24,007 --> 00:47:27,465
I can't remember, was it the Kono
or the Kristol?

800
00:47:27,711 --> 00:47:29,941
The crew called that vessel a lot of names.

801
00:47:30,180 --> 00:47:31,841
None repeatable in polite company.

802
00:47:32,082 --> 00:47:33,606
Answer the question.

803
00:47:33,851 --> 00:47:35,580
The new MP-5.

804
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:37,646
Would you like a silencer for that?

805
00:47:37,888 --> 00:47:39,788
I need to see your papers.

806
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:41,982
Get the fuck off me.

807
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,386
Dmitri!

808
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:49,689
The end-user certificate for this aircraft...

809
00:47:49,933 --> 00:47:52,424
states "Burkina Faso."

810
00:47:52,669 --> 00:47:54,330
Nice, very nice.

811
00:47:54,571 --> 00:47:55,560
Did you type this up yourself?

812
00:47:55,806 --> 00:47:58,104
The helicopter is to be used on
humanitarian missions.

813
00:47:58,342 --> 00:48:00,071
Oh, so you're a humanitarian?

814
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:01,641
Oh, absolutely.

815
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,945
This is a military aircraft.

816
00:48:04,181 --> 00:48:05,978
Not anymore.
Listen to the nephew!

817
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,649
What can they do with military hardware

818
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:09,750
but convert it to civilian use?

819
00:48:10,721 --> 00:48:11,779
The only way you could die from this baby

820
00:48:12,022 --> 00:48:14,149
now is if a food drop hits you.

821
00:48:16,927 --> 00:48:17,985
And this stuff over here, huh?

822
00:48:18,228 --> 00:48:19,752
Is it going to Burkina Faso... Ah,

823
00:48:19,997 --> 00:48:22,090
but to a different client at a
different address.

824
00:48:22,332 --> 00:48:23,663
That's just a coincidence is that it?

825
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:26,495
Do you take me for a complete
fucking fool?

826
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:27,999
Not complete, sir.

827
00:48:28,238 --> 00:48:30,069
And while I hesitate to tell your job.

828
00:48:30,307 --> 00:48:32,571
I must point out that
when shipped separately,

829
00:48:32,809 --> 00:48:33,571
the weapons and the aircraft

830
00:48:33,810 --> 00:48:35,038
both comply with current Interpol

831
00:48:35,279 --> 00:48:36,507
trade standards and practices.

832
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:38,874
We both know, that is an obscene

833
00:48:39,116 --> 00:48:41,050
bureaucratic loophole that's gonna
be closed

834
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:42,616
any goddamn day.

835
00:48:42,853 --> 00:48:44,445
But it's not closed.

836
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:46,086
And while certain people might interpret

837
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,950
this cargo as suspicious,

838
00:48:48,191 --> 00:48:49,783
thank God we live in a world,
where suspicion alone

839
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:51,722
does not constitute a crime.

840
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:52,951
And men like you

841
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,823
respect the rule of law.

842
00:48:59,703 --> 00:49:00,863
I was as guilty as sin,

843
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,935
but Valentine couldn't prove it.

844
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,505
And he was the rarest breed of
law enforcement officer,

845
00:49:05,742 --> 00:49:07,300
the type who knew I was breaking the law,

846
00:49:07,544 --> 00:49:10,206
but wouldn't break it himself to bust me.

847
00:49:10,847 --> 00:49:12,644
TWO DAYS LATER

848
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:15,513
Valentine wasn't the only one trying to

849
00:49:15,752 --> 00:49:16,741
put me out of business.

850
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:19,751
My uncle had turned down a half
dozen rival arms dealers,

851
00:49:19,990 --> 00:49:22,322
sometimes with offers better than mine.

852
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,086
But to Dmitri, you couldn't put
a price on loyalty.

853
00:49:38,842 --> 00:49:39,536
What was he doing here?

854
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:41,607
He is hoping to beat your offer.

855
00:49:41,845 --> 00:49:45,144
I told him to go have intercourse
with himself.

856
00:49:45,382 --> 00:49:46,474
But Yuri

857
00:49:46,717 --> 00:49:48,150
You need to make more payoffs.

858
00:49:48,385 --> 00:49:49,750
Too many know.
Don't worry.

859
00:49:49,987 --> 00:49:51,454
There are more VCRs and cigarettes.

860
00:49:51,688 --> 00:49:53,349
I left them in your new car.

861
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:56,657
Even your enemy was admiring that car.

862
00:50:00,797 --> 00:50:02,765
I'm the luckiest man alive.

863
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:03,989
You are.

864
00:50:43,073 --> 00:50:43,732
Hello.

865
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:44,599
Ava?

866
00:50:44,841 --> 00:50:46,103
Hi, baby.

867
00:50:47,711 --> 00:50:49,508
You forgot what time it is?

868
00:50:49,746 --> 00:50:51,577
Sorry, I...

869
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,682
How was that your audition?

870
00:50:55,619 --> 00:50:57,416
They're going in another direction.

871
00:50:57,654 --> 00:50:59,713
Direction with someone who can act.

872
00:50:59,956 --> 00:51:01,355
They don't deserve you.

873
00:51:03,326 --> 00:51:04,793
Where are you?

874
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:06,461
Is everything okay?

875
00:51:08,498 --> 00:51:10,523
It was a rough day at the office.

876
00:51:10,767 --> 00:51:11,665
Come home.

877
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,995
Soon. How's Nicki?

878
00:51:14,237 --> 00:51:17,035
He misses you. We both do.

879
00:51:17,874 --> 00:51:20,138
It's lonely without you here.

880
00:51:20,710 --> 00:51:22,610
You know I don't like nights.

881
00:51:23,046 --> 00:51:25,071
Ever since my parents...

882
00:51:33,023 --> 00:51:34,786
Yuri, what's that?

883
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:35,787
A party.

884
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:36,822
I'd better go.

885
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,857
Just wanted to call and hear your voice.

886
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:39,858
Kiss Nicki for me.

887
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,359
I love you.

888
00:51:44,768 --> 00:51:47,134
The pillaging didn't die with my uncle.

889
00:51:47,904 --> 00:51:49,428
After The Wall came down

890
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:51,834
$32 billion billion dollars worth of arms

891
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:54,908
were stolen and resold from
Ukraine alone,

892
00:51:55,145 --> 00:51:58,478
one of the greatest heists of the
20th Century.

893
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,090
Monrovia, Liberia - 1995

894
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,056
The primary market was Africa.

895
00:52:14,297 --> 00:52:15,855
Eleven major conflicts involving

896
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:18,192
thirty-two countries in less than a decade...

897
00:52:18,435 --> 00:52:20,096
A gunrunner's wet dream.

898
00:52:20,337 --> 00:52:22,305
At the time, the West couldn't care less.

899
00:52:22,539 --> 00:52:25,667
They had a white war in what was
left of Yugoslavia.

900
00:52:25,909 --> 00:52:28,036
I did the bulk of my business in Liberia...

901
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,405
"Land of the Free." Originally

902
00:52:30,647 --> 00:52:33,411
established as a homeland for
freed American slaves,

903
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,015
it's been enslaved by one dictator

904
00:52:35,252 --> 00:52:37,049
or another ever since.

905
00:52:37,287 --> 00:52:38,652
The latest was American-educated,

906
00:52:38,889 --> 00:52:41,915
self declared president, Andre Baptiste.

907
00:52:47,464 --> 00:52:48,590
Mr. Yuri!

908
00:52:50,767 --> 00:52:53,031
I'm Andre Baptiste, Junior.

909
00:52:54,237 --> 00:52:56,228
My father would like to meet you.

910
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:58,600
What an honor.

911
00:52:58,842 --> 00:52:59,206
Thank him.

912
00:52:59,442 --> 00:53:01,569
But unfortunately I have other business.

913
00:53:01,811 --> 00:53:04,780
It's a shame, it's a very busy schedule.

914
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:16,348
It is not, as they say, optional.

915
00:53:18,361 --> 00:53:20,727
My father is easily offended.

916
00:53:22,199 --> 00:53:23,894
My schedule just freed up.

917
00:53:26,269 --> 00:53:28,237
President Baptiste was my best customer

918
00:53:28,471 --> 00:53:30,268
but I was in no hurry to meet him.

919
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:32,668
He'd gotten a reputation for
routinely hacking off the

920
00:53:32,909 --> 00:53:34,877
limbs of those who opposed him.

921
00:53:35,111 --> 00:53:37,511
His seven-year civil war has been
described...

922
00:53:37,747 --> 00:53:41,615
as "a relentless campaign of
sadistic wanton violence."

923
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,046
That kind of sums up Andy for me.

924
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:48,819
The Glock is interesting.

925
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:51,890
It's made of a polymer composite.

926
00:53:52,128 --> 00:53:54,358
Many of my clients feel they can
get through airport security

927
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:56,498
without setting off a lot of bells
and whistles.

928
00:53:56,733 --> 00:53:58,564
Personally I do not recommend that.

929
00:53:58,802 --> 00:53:59,200
On the other hand,

930
00:53:59,436 --> 00:54:02,872
if you are looking for a traditional
wheel gun,

931
00:54:03,106 --> 00:54:04,596
there is no substitute for the six inches

932
00:54:04,841 --> 00:54:06,832
of muzzle energy of a.357 magnum.

933
00:54:07,077 --> 00:54:10,137
And of course, it will never jam.

934
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:14,179
Why did you do that?

935
00:54:14,417 --> 00:54:15,679
What did you say?

936
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:19,218
Now you'll have to buy it.

937
00:54:19,456 --> 00:54:20,423
It's a used gun.

938
00:54:22,592 --> 00:54:24,150
How can I sell a used gun?

939
00:54:26,963 --> 00:54:28,089
A used gun.

940
00:54:29,499 --> 00:54:30,830
A used gun.

941
00:54:32,636 --> 00:54:34,069
That's a good one.

942
00:54:36,806 --> 00:54:40,435
You know there is no discipline
with the youth today.

943
00:54:40,677 --> 00:54:43,840
I try to set an example but it is
difficult, eh?

944
00:54:45,315 --> 00:54:47,180
Personally, I blame MTV.

945
00:54:51,688 --> 00:54:52,950
A used gun.

946
00:54:57,394 --> 00:55:01,956
I think you and I, we can do business.

947
00:55:03,433 --> 00:55:05,663
If I thought I was scared of
Andre Senior,

948
00:55:05,902 --> 00:55:08,166
I knew I was scared of Andre Junior.

949
00:55:08,705 --> 00:55:10,536
Like father, like son.

950
00:55:10,774 --> 00:55:13,675
The guava doesn't fall too far
from the tree.

951
00:55:13,910 --> 00:55:15,434
He was also a cannibal.

952
00:55:15,679 --> 00:55:17,169
They say Andre would eat a victim's heart

953
00:55:17,414 --> 00:55:18,813
while it was still beating

954
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:20,880
to give him superhuman strength.

955
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,761
Monrovia itself was like being on
another planet.

956
00:55:31,995 --> 00:55:33,656
Planet Monrovia.

957
00:55:33,897 --> 00:55:34,454
From the temperature,

958
00:55:34,698 --> 00:55:38,225
it was obviously a planet close to
the sun.

959
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:40,026
I rarely saw another white man,

960
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:41,931
and I never left town alone.

961
00:55:42,172 --> 00:55:44,299
Outside town was the edge of hell.

962
00:55:44,541 --> 00:55:46,475
I didn't want to even gaze into it.

963
00:55:46,710 --> 00:55:51,170
This is your hotel. Two stars.

964
00:55:52,816 --> 00:55:54,681
Can you bring me the gun of Rambo?

965
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:56,783
Part one, two, or three?

966
00:55:57,020 --> 00:55:58,146
I've only seen part one.

967
00:55:58,388 --> 00:55:59,412
The M-60.

968
00:55:59,656 --> 00:56:01,453
Would you like the armor-piercing
bullets?

969
00:56:01,691 --> 00:56:02,919
Please.

970
00:56:04,260 --> 00:56:07,320
My father left a welcoming
present in your room.

971
00:56:07,864 --> 00:56:09,297
Enjoy.

972
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:28,520
My God, she nearly got her head cut off.

973
00:56:29,332 --> 00:56:30,731
When I get to America,

974
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:34,403
I will not live in Brentwood.

975
00:56:34,637 --> 00:56:35,831
Second floor.

976
00:56:40,943 --> 00:56:43,434
In the most AIDS-infested region
of the globe...

977
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:45,648
where one in four is infected...

978
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:47,474
Andre's idea of a joke was to put

979
00:56:47,717 --> 00:56:50,379
a young Iman and a young Naomi
in my bed.

980
00:56:50,620 --> 00:56:53,088
And no condom within 100 miles.

981
00:57:07,704 --> 00:57:09,171
Hello, Mr. Yuri.

982
00:57:10,673 --> 00:57:11,867
Hi.

983
00:57:12,108 --> 00:57:14,599
We'd be happy to make you happy.

984
00:57:15,878 --> 00:57:20,747
Uh, I can't. I'd love to.

985
00:57:20,983 --> 00:57:22,314
But I can't.

986
00:57:22,552 --> 00:57:23,576
Don't worry.

987
00:57:24,187 --> 00:57:25,745
We don't have anything.

988
00:57:30,860 --> 00:57:32,088
How do you know?

989
00:57:34,731 --> 00:57:36,562
Do we look like it?

990
00:57:36,799 --> 00:57:38,426
What if I have AIDS?

991
00:57:38,668 --> 00:57:39,999
Don't you worry?

992
00:57:41,070 --> 00:57:42,833
You worry too much.

993
00:57:44,140 --> 00:57:45,368
Why do you worry about
something that

994
00:57:45,608 --> 00:57:47,803
can kill you in ten years

995
00:57:48,144 --> 00:57:52,103
when there are so many things
that can kill you today?

996
00:57:54,550 --> 00:57:55,881
Now...

997
00:57:57,587 --> 00:57:59,885
...how can we make you happy?

998
00:58:02,658 --> 00:58:03,955
By leaving.

999
00:58:09,065 --> 00:58:12,159
These are my Kalashnikov Kids.

1000
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,301
My Boy Brigades.

1001
00:58:15,805 --> 00:58:17,705
I can see what you are thinking,

1002
00:58:17,940 --> 00:58:20,067
but we need every man we can get.

1003
00:58:20,309 --> 00:58:22,174
Even if they're not men?

1004
00:58:22,411 --> 00:58:24,038
A bullet from a fourteen-year-old...

1005
00:58:24,280 --> 00:58:27,977
...is just as effective as one from
a forty-year-old.

1006
00:58:28,217 --> 00:58:29,980
Often more effective.

1007
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:35,688
No one can stop this bath of blood.

1008
00:58:35,925 --> 00:58:36,755
It's not "bath of blood."

1009
00:58:36,993 --> 00:58:38,551
It's "bloodbath."

1010
00:58:39,729 --> 00:58:40,957
Thank you.

1011
00:58:41,764 --> 00:58:43,595
But I prefer it my way.

1012
00:58:56,245 --> 00:58:58,577
I am not going to pay your asking price.

1013
00:58:58,815 --> 00:59:00,715
We are not a rich people.
And besides,

1014
00:59:00,950 --> 00:59:04,113
the market is already flooded with
your Kalashnikovs.

1015
00:59:04,353 --> 00:59:05,980
Do you realize in some parts of
my country

1016
00:59:06,222 --> 00:59:08,087
you can get one for the price of a chicken?

1017
00:59:08,324 --> 00:59:09,882
But you can't just consider unit price.

1018
00:59:10,126 --> 00:59:11,457
You forget ancillary costs.

1019
00:59:11,694 --> 00:59:13,821
End-user certificates need to be
forged and notarized,

1020
00:59:14,063 --> 00:59:14,995
Shell companies set up,

1021
00:59:15,231 --> 00:59:17,222
insurance purchased,
pilots and crews hired.

1022
00:59:17,466 --> 00:59:19,161
Not to mention bribes.

1023
00:59:19,435 --> 00:59:20,402
You can't get a nut and bolt out

1024
00:59:20,636 --> 00:59:22,297
of the Eastern Bloc without a bribe.

1025
00:59:22,538 --> 00:59:23,732
There's one bribe for the nut,

1026
00:59:23,973 --> 00:59:25,406
another for the bolt.

1027
00:59:25,641 --> 00:59:26,608
Andy... Andy, listen to me.

1028
00:59:26,843 --> 00:59:29,243
This is an expensive proposition.

1029
00:59:29,478 --> 00:59:30,638
"Andy"?

1030
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:39,184
I am going to pay you in timber or stones.

1031
00:59:42,325 --> 00:59:43,314
I'll take the stones.

1032
00:59:43,559 --> 00:59:47,791
It's kind of hard to get a tree trunk
into my hand luggage.

1033
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:50,225
I know you're planning a new offensive.

1034
00:59:50,466 --> 00:59:51,899
If you can delay a week,

1035
00:59:52,134 --> 00:59:54,432
I can get you armored personnel carriers.

1036
00:59:54,670 --> 00:59:57,161
They'd greatly reduce your casualties...

1037
00:59:57,406 --> 01:00:00,398
...and give you a significant
strategic advantage.

1038
01:00:01,811 --> 01:00:04,644
You know, they call me
the Lord Of War.

1039
01:00:05,314 --> 01:00:07,077
But perhaps it is you.

1040
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:11,210
It's not "Lord Of War," it's "Warlord."

1041
01:00:12,588 --> 01:00:14,988
Thank you, but I prefer it my way.

1042
01:00:18,661 --> 01:00:21,824
Conflict diamonds are a common
currency in West Africa,

1043
01:00:22,064 --> 01:00:23,929
also referred to as "blood diamonds"

1044
01:00:24,166 --> 01:00:27,329
since bloodshed is what they
generally finance.

1045
01:00:28,304 --> 01:00:29,931
By the late '90s, my wealth had caught up

1046
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:31,833
to my lies about my wealth.

1047
01:00:32,074 --> 01:00:34,042
Even surpassed my lies.

1048
01:00:34,277 --> 01:00:37,508
I could even afford to become a
patron of the arts.

1049
01:00:45,922 --> 01:00:48,117
It's just that I can't believe it.

1050
01:00:48,357 --> 01:00:50,120
Well, of... of course, it's wonderful.

1051
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:51,155
I just...

1052
01:00:51,394 --> 01:00:54,192
I didn't expect it to happen so soon.

1053
01:00:55,197 --> 01:00:59,065
Yes. Well, that wou-that would be
great, too yeah.

1054
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:03,264
It's wonderful. Thank you so much.

1055
01:01:03,506 --> 01:01:06,532
It's... Yuri. Okay, thank you. Bye.

1056
01:01:06,776 --> 01:01:08,209
Yuri, that was the dealer on the phone.

1057
01:01:08,444 --> 01:01:09,536
I just sold my first painting.

1058
01:01:09,779 --> 01:01:11,974
Aah! That's fantastic.

1059
01:01:13,349 --> 01:01:14,281
Uh, who bought it?

1060
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:15,677
It's someone important.

1061
01:01:15,918 --> 01:01:17,442
They want to remain anonymous.

1062
01:01:17,687 --> 01:01:19,814
This is so wonderful!
How was your trip?

1063
01:01:20,056 --> 01:01:21,080
You know, same old, same old.

1064
01:01:21,324 --> 01:01:21,983
Where's Nicki?

1065
01:01:22,224 --> 01:01:24,749
Oh, in bed, I'm sorry.
He couldn't stay up.

1066
01:01:24,994 --> 01:01:25,585
That's best.

1067
01:01:25,828 --> 01:01:27,193
My first painting!

1068
01:01:27,430 --> 01:01:29,261
I'm officially an artist!

1069
01:01:29,498 --> 01:01:31,466
This calls for a drink.
What doesn't?

1070
01:01:33,469 --> 01:01:34,800
Hi.

1071
01:01:35,037 --> 01:01:36,868
Yuri, this is uh...

1072
01:01:37,106 --> 01:01:38,004
Candy.

1073
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:40,231
Candy. Of course.

1074
01:01:40,743 --> 01:01:43,541
Any friend of my brother's is a...

1075
01:01:43,779 --> 01:01:45,144
friend of my brother's.

1076
01:01:45,381 --> 01:01:48,714
You have a beautiful... everything.

1077
01:01:50,386 --> 01:01:51,375
Yes, he does.

1078
01:01:51,620 --> 01:01:52,814
Yes, I do.

1079
01:01:53,055 --> 01:01:53,953
I'm going to kiss Nicki goodnight.

1080
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:55,282
Okay.

1081
01:02:50,780 --> 01:02:51,974
How are you, brother?

1082
01:02:52,214 --> 01:02:53,579
Well, you know,

1083
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:56,182
still the resident family fuckup.

1084
01:02:56,685 --> 01:03:00,177
Yeah. Well, I guess someone has
to do it.

1085
01:03:00,423 --> 01:03:01,412
Well.

1086
01:03:02,691 --> 01:03:06,092
Hey, Ava knows, right?

1087
01:03:11,267 --> 01:03:13,701
I never want to say anything,

1088
01:03:13,936 --> 01:03:14,561
She doesn't have to know.

1089
01:03:14,804 --> 01:03:16,101
She understands.

1090
01:03:16,338 --> 01:03:18,431
She's a survivor, like me.

1091
01:03:19,475 --> 01:03:20,601
She may be a survivor,

1092
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:22,435
but she's not like you.

1093
01:03:25,714 --> 01:03:27,648
Really She doesn't know
how you pay for all this

1094
01:03:27,883 --> 01:03:29,783
We don't talk about it.

1095
01:03:30,386 --> 01:03:33,583
How many car salesman talk
about their work? Huh?

1096
01:03:33,823 --> 01:03:34,721
How many cigarette salesmen?

1097
01:03:34,957 --> 01:03:36,356
Both their products kill more people

1098
01:03:36,592 --> 01:03:37,217
every year than mine.

1099
01:03:37,460 --> 01:03:40,691
At least mine has a safety switch.

1100
01:03:41,030 --> 01:03:43,624
If those guys can leave their work
at the office,

1101
01:03:43,866 --> 01:03:45,265
so can I.

1102
01:03:46,602 --> 01:03:49,696
God damn, you are good!

1103
01:03:51,440 --> 01:03:52,873
You really are.

1104
01:03:54,343 --> 01:03:56,368
You almost had me convinced.

1105
01:04:06,922 --> 01:04:08,514
Could you...

1106
01:04:11,127 --> 01:04:12,890
could you help me out with...

1107
01:04:19,602 --> 01:04:20,728
Why?

1108
01:04:22,872 --> 01:04:23,861
Why?

1109
01:04:25,508 --> 01:04:26,600
Why?

1110
01:04:27,710 --> 01:04:29,541
Why what?

1111
01:04:29,778 --> 01:04:30,608
Why?

1112
01:04:30,846 --> 01:04:31,471
Why?
I don't know.

1113
01:04:31,714 --> 01:04:32,976
Why...
I don't know.

1114
01:04:33,215 --> 01:04:34,307
Why what?

1115
01:04:35,885 --> 01:04:38,217
Why're you so fucked up all the time?

1116
01:04:43,792 --> 01:04:46,090
Because I am. I don't know.

1117
01:04:56,172 --> 01:04:57,799
I didn't know how much Ava
really knew...

1118
01:04:58,040 --> 01:05:00,201
and how much she ignored.

1119
01:05:00,442 --> 01:05:01,568
She never questioned how a guy

1120
01:05:01,810 --> 01:05:02,834
in the transport business...

1121
01:05:03,078 --> 01:05:06,275
could afford to give her 18 carat
diamond earrings.

1122
01:05:06,515 --> 01:05:09,575
I guess she didn't want to hear the answer.

1123
01:05:09,818 --> 01:05:10,978
Mostly, She seemed content

1124
01:05:11,220 --> 01:05:12,517
that I was a good provider...

1125
01:05:12,755 --> 01:05:15,724
and as far as she was concerned, loyal.

1126
01:05:15,958 --> 01:05:16,982
Despite the other women...

1127
01:05:17,226 --> 01:05:18,557
I always made love to Ava

1128
01:05:18,794 --> 01:05:20,762
as if she was the only one.

1129
01:05:24,500 --> 01:05:26,263
I'm not saying I didn't have setbacks.

1130
01:05:26,502 --> 01:05:28,493
It's not called gunrunning for nothing.

1131
01:05:28,737 --> 01:05:30,227
You gotta be fast on your feet.

1132
01:05:30,472 --> 01:05:33,600
Some revolutions blow over
the guns even get there.

1133
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:34,831
There's nothing's more expensive

1134
01:05:35,077 --> 01:05:36,669
for an arms dealer than peace.

1135
01:05:36,912 --> 01:05:39,005
Truce? What do you mean, truce?

1136
01:05:39,248 --> 01:05:41,011
The guns are already on their way.

1137
01:05:42,318 --> 01:05:43,945
Peace talks.

1138
01:05:45,120 --> 01:05:45,882
All right, forget it.

1139
01:05:46,121 --> 01:05:47,281
I'll re-route the shipment to the Balkans.

1140
01:05:47,523 --> 01:05:48,820
When they talk about war,

1141
01:05:49,058 --> 01:05:50,616
they keep their word.

1142
01:05:58,133 --> 01:05:59,862
Of course, a new breed of gunrunner

1143
01:06:00,102 --> 01:06:02,229
requires a new breed of cop.

1144
01:06:07,109 --> 01:06:08,940
Henry, take Park Avenue.

1145
01:06:27,296 --> 01:06:29,093
Take 'em on a tour of New Jersey.

1146
01:07:03,732 --> 01:07:08,965
Yuri, there are men going through
our garbage cans.

1147
01:07:09,204 --> 01:07:10,466
Well, it's probably just some reporters

1148
01:07:10,706 --> 01:07:12,071
looking for somebody else.

1149
01:07:12,308 --> 01:07:15,744
I have a feeling they don't work
for the tabloids.

1150
01:07:16,779 --> 01:07:18,007
Yuri...

1151
01:07:19,948 --> 01:07:22,712
is there anything I should be
worried about?

1152
01:07:23,786 --> 01:07:25,151
No, nothing.

1153
01:07:25,387 --> 01:07:26,513
Nothing?

1154
01:07:26,755 --> 01:07:27,813
I love you.

1155
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,356
I love you, too.

1156
01:07:35,030 --> 01:07:36,122
Sir.

1157
01:08:24,146 --> 01:08:26,410
I was now the best merchant
of death alive.

1158
01:08:26,648 --> 01:08:29,208
I didn't own my own plane,
I owned a fleet.

1159
01:08:29,451 --> 01:08:31,248
Running guns into Liberia,
Sierra Leone,

1160
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,978
or the Ivory Coast at least once a week.

1161
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:36,487
Most trips I had phony paperwork.

1162
01:08:36,725 --> 01:08:37,589
The deadline was tight

1163
01:08:37,826 --> 01:08:38,918
and I had to cut corners,

1164
01:08:39,161 --> 01:08:41,391
I had no paperwork at all.

1165
01:08:43,599 --> 01:08:45,191
But I wasn't overly concerned.

1166
01:08:45,434 --> 01:08:47,493
There was hardly any radar over
most of Africa

1167
01:08:47,736 --> 01:08:49,670
and even fewer people to watch it.

1168
01:08:55,077 --> 01:08:56,772
Charlie Echo India,

1169
01:08:57,012 --> 01:08:58,604
...re-route to Kabala airport...

1170
01:08:58,847 --> 01:09:00,747
...on heading zero-two nine.

1171
01:09:00,983 --> 01:09:02,507
Comply immediately.

1172
01:09:02,751 --> 01:09:04,514
Yuri, what the fuck is going on?

1173
01:09:16,231 --> 01:09:17,391
Hello, Southern? It's Yuri.

1174
01:09:17,633 --> 01:09:18,565
I Sorry to call you on this number.

1175
01:09:18,801 --> 01:09:20,428
But I've got Interpol's all over my ass.

1176
01:09:20,669 --> 01:09:22,034
I can't know you right now.

1177
01:09:22,271 --> 01:09:24,432
It's uh, not a good time.

1178
01:09:26,341 --> 01:09:27,535
Not a good time?

1179
01:09:31,346 --> 01:09:32,404
Motherfucker!

1180
01:09:36,852 --> 01:09:39,480
Charlie, Echo, India,
comply immediately.

1181
01:09:39,721 --> 01:09:41,120
This is your last warning.

1182
01:09:41,356 --> 01:09:42,380
Where was the first fucking warning?

1183
01:09:42,624 --> 01:09:44,387
Rock your wings
if you intend to comply

1184
01:09:44,626 --> 01:09:45,888
I'm putting us down.

1185
01:09:51,200 --> 01:09:52,394
If you land, we're going away.

1186
01:09:52,634 --> 01:09:53,430
I don't have paperwork.

1187
01:09:53,669 --> 01:09:54,693
We're in a flying fucking bomb!

1188
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:56,495
They're firing bullets at our bullets.

1189
01:09:56,738 --> 01:09:58,103
I'm putting us down.

1190
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,570
Okay, okay. Fuck!

1191
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:02,538
This is Charlie, Echo, India.

1192
01:10:02,778 --> 01:10:04,712
Request re-route to Kabala airport,

1193
01:10:04,947 --> 01:10:06,642
bearing zero-two-nine.

1194
01:10:06,882 --> 01:10:09,476
No, not the airport. There the highway.

1195
01:10:09,718 --> 01:10:10,707
It's our only hope.

1196
01:10:10,953 --> 01:10:12,284
Are you fucking mad?

1197
01:10:12,521 --> 01:10:14,182
A pothole will set us off.

1198
01:10:14,523 --> 01:10:16,184
You underestimate yourself, Alexei.

1199
01:10:16,425 --> 01:10:17,187
You're the best.

1200
01:10:17,426 --> 01:10:18,791
You're the shit, Alexei, you're the shit!

1201
01:10:19,027 --> 01:10:20,995
You're the shit! You're the shit!

1202
01:10:22,164 --> 01:10:23,859
Of course Alexei wasn't the best.

1203
01:10:24,099 --> 01:10:25,623
He'd come forty-second out of
forty three

1204
01:10:25,868 --> 01:10:28,166
at the Moscow Flight School.

1205
01:10:35,611 --> 01:10:37,340
Oh, God, what's he doing?

1206
01:10:38,213 --> 01:10:39,840
Is this guy nuts?

1207
01:10:41,650 --> 01:10:42,878
I can't land there, sir.

1208
01:10:43,118 --> 01:10:44,551
Kabala's fifteen minutes away.

1209
01:10:44,786 --> 01:10:45,844
He can't get far.

1210
01:10:46,088 --> 01:10:48,556
I want a truck on the tarmac.

1211
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,131
We gonna be okay.

1212
01:12:08,470 --> 01:12:09,494
Where are you going?

1213
01:12:09,738 --> 01:12:11,467
As far from the evidence as we can get.

1214
01:12:11,707 --> 01:12:14,574
Wait, there's not going to be any evidence!

1215
01:12:29,691 --> 01:12:31,022
Come here. Come here.

1216
01:12:34,229 --> 01:12:36,322
Hey, don't be shy. Here, look.

1217
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:37,224
Free sample

1218
01:12:37,466 --> 01:12:38,933
help yourself, okay? Free sample.

1219
01:12:39,167 --> 01:12:40,293
Tell your friend.

1220
01:12:43,205 --> 01:12:44,365
Gun for you.

1221
01:12:44,606 --> 01:12:45,595
Happy times. Come on.

1222
01:12:45,841 --> 01:12:47,172
Help yourselves. No charge.

1223
01:12:47,409 --> 01:12:48,467
Everything goes.

1224
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:51,611
Guns, guns, guns, yes,
come on up!

1225
01:12:51,847 --> 01:12:53,974
Here! You're having fun now, huh?

1226
01:12:55,684 --> 01:12:59,211
Come on! Guns, guns, guns! Yes!

1227
01:12:59,454 --> 01:13:03,015
Bullets, guns, grenades!

1228
01:13:03,258 --> 01:13:04,156
Take 'em all.

1229
01:13:04,393 --> 01:13:06,088
Take the whole crate. Go ahead.

1230
01:13:09,965 --> 01:13:12,365
Gun, grenades, hooray!

1231
01:13:12,601 --> 01:13:15,627
Bullets! Guns! Grenades!

1232
01:13:16,571 --> 01:13:17,469
Yeah.

1233
01:13:17,906 --> 01:13:18,930
That one's got your name on it.

1234
01:13:19,174 --> 01:13:20,641
You want one, too? Come on.

1235
01:13:20,876 --> 01:13:22,241
Don't forget the bullets.

1236
01:13:22,477 --> 01:13:23,603
Don't forget the bullets.

1237
01:13:23,845 --> 01:13:26,109
How can you shoot a gun
if you don't have bullets?

1238
01:13:26,348 --> 01:13:28,578
Everything goes for free!

1239
01:13:28,817 --> 01:13:32,218
Guns, grenades! All you see. Bullets,

1240
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:34,183
guns, grenades.

1241
01:13:34,423 --> 01:13:36,948
Hooray, hooray!

1242
01:13:37,726 --> 01:13:39,159
Have the bullets.

1243
01:13:39,394 --> 01:13:41,157
What a cargo crew at Heathrow Airport

1244
01:13:41,396 --> 01:13:43,296
does in a day took a bunch of

1245
01:13:43,532 --> 01:13:46,933
malnourished Sierra Leonean
locals ten minutes.

1246
01:13:47,969 --> 01:13:49,869
By the time Agent Valentine got there,

1247
01:13:50,105 --> 01:13:53,131
you could find more guns on
a plane full of Quakers.

1248
01:14:00,415 --> 01:14:01,780
Yuri Orlov.

1249
01:14:02,350 --> 01:14:03,874
Ow! Fuck!

1250
01:14:04,119 --> 01:14:05,279
You run from us?

1251
01:14:05,654 --> 01:14:07,121
No, Mbizi. No!

1252
01:14:07,355 --> 01:14:08,879
Can you run with no legs?

1253
01:14:09,858 --> 01:14:11,325
Let me make him disappear,
Mr. Valentine

1254
01:14:11,560 --> 01:14:13,255
Around here, people disappear all the time.

1255
01:14:13,495 --> 01:14:14,462
I can't do that.

1256
01:14:14,696 --> 01:14:17,062
Look where we are. Who will know?

1257
01:14:19,801 --> 01:14:20,859
We will.

1258
01:14:27,809 --> 01:14:29,436
He's gonna get what's coming to him.

1259
01:14:29,945 --> 01:14:31,310
I'm not as certain.

1260
01:14:39,988 --> 01:14:41,148
All right, get up.

1261
01:14:45,727 --> 01:14:46,421
What's the charge?

1262
01:14:46,661 --> 01:14:48,561
What are you doing in Sierra Leone...

1263
01:14:49,097 --> 01:14:50,121
I'm on safari.

1264
01:14:50,365 --> 01:14:53,528
Yeah? You're hunting wildebeests

1265
01:14:53,769 --> 01:14:54,758
with a submachine gun?

1266
01:14:55,003 --> 01:14:56,732
Do you also work with the
Park Service?

1267
01:14:56,972 --> 01:14:58,940
Hunting without a license,
is that the charge?

1268
01:14:59,174 --> 01:15:01,005
Why are we playing games?

1269
01:15:01,243 --> 01:15:02,608
You traffic arms.

1270
01:15:02,844 --> 01:15:03,208
Trade.

1271
01:15:03,445 --> 01:15:03,934
Trade.

1272
01:15:04,179 --> 01:15:05,476
Traffic.

1273
01:15:05,714 --> 01:15:09,309
You get rich by giving the
poorest people on the planet

1274
01:15:09,551 --> 01:15:11,075
the means to continue killing each other.

1275
01:15:11,319 --> 01:15:12,946
Do you know why I do what I do?

1276
01:15:13,188 --> 01:15:15,952
I mean, there are more
prestigious assignments.

1277
01:15:16,191 --> 01:15:17,783
Keeping track of nuclear arsenals,

1278
01:15:18,026 --> 01:15:20,051
You'd think that's more critical to
world security,

1279
01:15:20,295 --> 01:15:21,023
but it's not.

1280
01:15:21,263 --> 01:15:23,197
No, nine out of ten war victims today

1281
01:15:23,431 --> 01:15:26,923
are killed with assault rifles and
small like yours.

1282
01:15:27,169 --> 01:15:27,931
Those nuclear missiles?

1283
01:15:28,170 --> 01:15:30,661
They sit in their silos. Your AK-47?

1284
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:33,704
That is the real weapon of mass
destruction.

1285
01:15:34,109 --> 01:15:36,669
I don't want people dead, Agent Valentine.

1286
01:15:36,912 --> 01:15:38,038
I don't put a gun to anybody's head

1287
01:15:38,280 --> 01:15:39,804
and make them shoot.

1288
01:15:40,048 --> 01:15:42,414
I admit, but shooting war is better
for business,

1289
01:15:42,651 --> 01:15:45,051
but I prefer people to
fire my guns and miss.

1290
01:15:45,287 --> 01:15:46,845
Just as long as they're firing.

1291
01:15:56,298 --> 01:15:57,788
Can I go now?

1292
01:15:58,033 --> 01:16:01,196
You've got nothing on me.
Except cuffs.

1293
01:16:04,840 --> 01:16:06,705
Since you're so concerned with the law,

1294
01:16:06,942 --> 01:16:08,307
you must know that I'm legally

1295
01:16:08,543 --> 01:16:10,443
permitted to hold you for
twenty- four hours

1296
01:16:10,679 --> 01:16:11,976
without charging you.

1297
01:16:12,681 --> 01:16:15,206
You might ask why I would do
that and I can assure you.

1298
01:16:15,450 --> 01:16:16,712
It's not because I enjoy your
company,

1299
01:16:16,952 --> 01:16:18,283
because I don't.

1300
01:16:18,420 --> 01:16:19,409
No, the reason why

1301
01:16:19,654 --> 01:16:21,451
I'll delay you for every second

1302
01:16:21,690 --> 01:16:23,521
of the permissible twenty-four hours

1303
01:16:23,758 --> 01:16:25,988
Is I'm delaying your deadly trade

1304
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:27,889
and the deaths of your victims.

1305
01:16:28,129 --> 01:16:29,790
I don't think of it as taking a day from you...

1306
01:16:30,031 --> 01:16:31,760
...but giving a day to them.

1307
01:16:32,000 --> 01:16:34,025
Some innocent man, woman, or child

1308
01:16:34,269 --> 01:16:35,201
is going to have an extra day

1309
01:16:35,437 --> 01:16:38,565
on this earth because you're not free.

1310
01:16:40,041 --> 01:16:45,138
So, I will see you in twenty-three hours

1311
01:16:45,380 --> 01:16:47,075
and fifty-five minutes, hm?

1312
01:16:52,654 --> 01:16:54,815
Valentine knew he didn't have to guard me.

1313
01:16:55,056 --> 01:16:56,648
There was nowhere to go.

1314
01:16:57,492 --> 01:16:58,754
Or maybe he was hoping the locals

1315
01:16:58,994 --> 01:17:00,791
would tear me apart.

1316
01:17:01,029 --> 01:17:03,589
But they were too busy with the plane.

1317
01:17:05,967 --> 01:17:06,865
It's like parking your car

1318
01:17:07,102 --> 01:17:09,696
in certain neighborhoods in the Bronx.

1319
01:17:09,938 --> 01:17:11,599
You just don't do it.

1320
01:17:23,051 --> 01:17:24,018
The way I looked at it

1321
01:17:24,252 --> 01:17:27,688
it's the way of Africa, maybe life.

1322
01:17:28,156 --> 01:17:29,555
Everything that comes from the earth

1323
01:17:29,791 --> 01:17:31,588
eventually returns.

1324
01:17:32,027 --> 01:17:35,428
Even a 40-ton Atonov-12 cargo plane.

1325
01:18:32,620 --> 01:18:35,555
A gift. For you.

1326
01:18:37,759 --> 01:18:40,125
You know, you've arrived just in time.

1327
01:18:40,362 --> 01:18:42,353
I was afraid that he might die

1328
01:18:42,597 --> 01:18:46,192
before you got your chance to kill him.

1329
01:18:52,207 --> 01:18:58,442
This man came here hoping to
take your place.

1330
01:19:01,249 --> 01:19:02,739
Is that not so?

1331
01:19:14,229 --> 01:19:17,426
No, I'm not here to supply
Mr. Baptiste.

1332
01:19:18,500 --> 01:19:22,197
I am here to supply his enemies.

1333
01:19:24,939 --> 01:19:27,999
I fear it's a sale I shall never complete.

1334
01:19:30,745 --> 01:19:34,875
He killed your blood... Your uncle...

1335
01:19:35,784 --> 01:19:38,048
when he tried to kill you.

1336
01:19:46,728 --> 01:19:48,161
No.

1337
01:19:48,396 --> 01:19:49,556
No?

1338
01:19:52,067 --> 01:19:54,297
You want that I should let him go?

1339
01:19:56,538 --> 01:20:00,304
"No. I..."

1340
01:20:02,777 --> 01:20:04,540
You do want him dead.

1341
01:20:04,779 --> 01:20:07,805
You just... don't want

1342
01:20:08,049 --> 01:20:10,347
to have to do it yourself.

1343
01:20:15,557 --> 01:20:16,717
So.

1344
01:20:18,126 --> 01:20:19,889
We will do this together.

1345
01:20:24,566 --> 01:20:31,301
This will be a bonding experience.

1346
01:20:36,678 --> 01:20:39,841
You know you can stop this
any time that you want.

1347
01:20:40,081 --> 01:20:42,140
But I don't think that you do.

1348
01:20:42,383 --> 01:20:43,816
Just say the word.

1349
01:20:45,186 --> 01:20:48,314
Say it. "Stop."

1350
01:21:01,970 --> 01:21:03,460
Stop.

1351
01:21:13,114 --> 01:21:15,207
I will get you another room,
my friend.

1352
01:21:16,484 --> 01:21:18,816
With a much nicer view.

1353
01:21:51,586 --> 01:21:53,850
He ordered you brown-brown,
Mr. Yuri.

1354
01:21:57,825 --> 01:21:58,985
What?

1355
01:21:59,227 --> 01:21:59,852
Brown-brown.

1356
01:22:00,094 --> 01:22:01,322
What is it?

1357
01:22:01,563 --> 01:22:03,622
A mixture of cocaine...

1358
01:22:04,666 --> 01:22:06,224
...and gunpowder.

1359
01:22:07,168 --> 01:22:09,159
They give it to the young boys
before they do battle.

1360
01:22:09,404 --> 01:22:10,962
They'll do anything!

1361
01:22:12,807 --> 01:22:14,468
Some other time.

1362
01:22:14,709 --> 01:22:18,839
I suggest you try it,
at least once, Mr. Yuri.

1363
01:22:19,080 --> 01:22:20,411
Why?

1364
01:22:20,648 --> 01:22:23,640
'Cause it's your gunpowder.

1365
01:22:45,640 --> 01:22:46,902
Even before that night,

1366
01:22:47,141 --> 01:22:50,201
I'd started doing a lot of cocaine
in West Africa.

1367
01:22:50,445 --> 01:22:52,743
I'd never tried brown-brown before,

1368
01:22:52,981 --> 01:22:55,313
but then I'd never killed a man, either.

1369
01:23:13,001 --> 01:23:14,400
Oh.

1370
01:23:20,275 --> 01:23:22,835
Oh, I didn't do anything, did I?

1371
01:23:23,845 --> 01:23:25,608
I didn't do anything, did I?

1372
01:23:25,847 --> 01:23:27,747
You didn't do much.

1373
01:23:29,751 --> 01:23:31,514
Wait. Are you sick?

1374
01:23:31,753 --> 01:23:34,620
SIDA? AIDS?

1375
01:23:36,224 --> 01:23:39,387
Ask the white man. He will know.

1376
01:23:39,627 --> 01:23:42,289
Sir, will my hand grow back?

1377
01:23:50,772 --> 01:23:51,704
Simeon.

1378
01:23:51,939 --> 01:23:55,136
Remember, Yuri, take sides.

1379
01:23:58,780 --> 01:24:00,145
Simeon!

1380
01:24:03,284 --> 01:24:06,412
Don't! He's Andre's.
Fuck Andre!

1381
01:24:06,654 --> 01:24:08,212
Fuck Andre!

1382
01:24:11,159 --> 01:24:13,389
I'm sorry they don't usually do that.

1383
01:24:16,097 --> 01:24:17,621
Let me look it. Maybe I can fix it.

1384
01:24:17,865 --> 01:24:19,162
Let me see it. It's the magazine.

1385
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,697
Give it to me.

1386
01:24:22,570 --> 01:24:23,798
Fuck you!

1387
01:24:49,831 --> 01:24:52,026
I started to feel I'd been cursed.

1388
01:24:52,633 --> 01:24:54,760
...the curse of invincibility.

1389
01:24:59,107 --> 01:25:01,007
Nicki, please, go to your room.

1390
01:25:04,779 --> 01:25:06,508
I don't believe you.

1391
01:25:07,482 --> 01:25:09,074
Can you prove any of this?

1392
01:25:10,418 --> 01:25:12,943
Mr. Orlov goes to a lot of trouble

1393
01:25:13,187 --> 01:25:15,212
to make his business look legitimate.

1394
01:25:15,456 --> 01:25:16,514
Even to you.

1395
01:25:16,758 --> 01:25:19,249
Perhaps especially to you.

1396
01:25:19,494 --> 01:25:22,190
I don't expect we'll find anything here today.

1397
01:25:22,430 --> 01:25:23,954
So what do you want?

1398
01:25:26,100 --> 01:25:28,660
I was hoping that you would help me.

1399
01:25:35,476 --> 01:25:38,206
I understand that uh...

1400
01:25:38,446 --> 01:25:41,210
your parents died tragically?

1401
01:25:45,319 --> 01:25:48,379
The illegal firearms used to murder
your mother and father

1402
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:51,990
were procured from men exactly
like your husband.

1403
01:25:54,228 --> 01:25:55,923
I'd like you to leave.

1404
01:25:59,434 --> 01:26:01,402
Okay. Gentlemen.

1405
01:26:16,784 --> 01:26:18,217
Ava?

1406
01:26:27,562 --> 01:26:29,086
Ava, what's wrong?

1407
01:26:30,398 --> 01:26:32,366
I can't wear the clothes.

1408
01:26:33,234 --> 01:26:35,065
Can't wear the jewelry.

1409
01:26:36,737 --> 01:26:38,637
Can't drive the car.

1410
01:26:41,008 --> 01:26:42,976
Can't live in this house.

1411
01:26:43,211 --> 01:26:44,940
Everything's got blood on it.

1412
01:26:45,179 --> 01:26:46,703
Blood on it?

1413
01:26:48,883 --> 01:26:50,680
What's the matter with you?

1414
01:26:54,622 --> 01:26:56,419
Don't be so melodramatic.

1415
01:26:56,657 --> 01:26:57,681
I'm melodramatic.

1416
01:26:57,925 --> 01:27:00,086
I'm a failed actress, remember?

1417
01:27:09,036 --> 01:27:11,596
I told you, these people, it's political.

1418
01:27:11,839 --> 01:27:13,704
They lie. They're liars.

1419
01:27:13,941 --> 01:27:15,533
Look at me. They lie to make

1420
01:27:15,776 --> 01:27:16,765
themselves look good, okay?

1421
01:27:17,011 --> 01:27:18,706
You can't trust them.

1422
01:27:18,946 --> 01:27:20,709
It's not just them.

1423
01:27:23,584 --> 01:27:26,849
Don't worry. Your family didn't
say anything.

1424
01:27:27,088 --> 01:27:28,715
They didn't have to.

1425
01:27:30,858 --> 01:27:35,158
I sell people a means to defend
themselves. Ava.

1426
01:27:35,396 --> 01:27:36,192
That's all.

1427
01:27:36,430 --> 01:27:40,332
Yuri, I see the news. I see those pictures.

1428
01:27:40,568 --> 01:27:41,535
The guns are bigger than the boys!

1429
01:27:41,769 --> 01:27:44,260
There is nothing illegal
about what I do!

1430
01:27:44,505 --> 01:27:46,973
I don't care if it's legal!

1431
01:27:47,208 --> 01:27:48,641
It's wrong!

1432
01:28:08,195 --> 01:28:10,356
Please, stop.

1433
01:28:13,334 --> 01:28:16,132
It makes no difference if I stop.

1434
01:28:16,370 --> 01:28:18,167
Someone will take my place the next day.

1435
01:28:18,406 --> 01:28:21,807
So let them. We have enough.

1436
01:28:22,977 --> 01:28:25,036
It's not about the money.

1437
01:28:26,614 --> 01:28:28,411
Then what is it?

1438
01:28:32,587 --> 01:28:34,145
I'm good at it.

1439
01:28:44,632 --> 01:28:48,500
I feel like all I've done my whole life
is be pretty.

1440
01:28:48,736 --> 01:28:53,537
I mean all I've done is be born.

1441
01:28:54,308 --> 01:28:58,642
I'm a failed actress, a failed artist.

1442
01:28:58,879 --> 01:29:00,642
I'm not much good as a mother.

1443
01:29:03,484 --> 01:29:06,419
I'm not even that pretty anymore.

1444
01:29:09,624 --> 01:29:13,720
I have failed at everything, Yuri.

1445
01:29:15,363 --> 01:29:18,730
But I won't fail as a human being.

1446
01:29:22,770 --> 01:29:24,237
My enemies had finally found a weapon

1447
01:29:24,472 --> 01:29:26,064
that could hurt me.

1448
01:29:27,808 --> 01:29:28,604
For the next six months,

1449
01:29:28,843 --> 01:29:30,037
I stopped running guns.

1450
01:29:30,277 --> 01:29:31,005
I went legitimate.

1451
01:29:31,245 --> 01:29:32,769
This is an untapped market.

1452
01:29:33,014 --> 01:29:35,482
I'm talking over five million
cubic meters of timber

1453
01:29:35,716 --> 01:29:36,740
in the first year alone.

1454
01:29:36,984 --> 01:29:39,077
Over 100 exploitable species.

1455
01:29:39,320 --> 01:29:40,184
The oil?

1456
01:29:40,421 --> 01:29:42,480
Between you and me, this...

1457
01:29:42,723 --> 01:29:44,714
Ten thousand barrels a month?

1458
01:29:44,959 --> 01:29:48,588
He must be lying. He's talking!

1459
01:29:48,829 --> 01:29:49,818
Listen, there are gas reserves off the

1460
01:29:50,064 --> 01:29:52,089
Ivory Coast that OPEC doesn't
even know about.

1461
01:29:52,333 --> 01:29:54,198
The phone numbers all check out.

1462
01:29:56,404 --> 01:29:58,031
It's all on the level.

1463
01:29:59,240 --> 01:30:01,674
No wonder Valentine was confused.

1464
01:30:15,356 --> 01:30:16,789
Thank God there are still legal ways

1465
01:30:17,024 --> 01:30:19,254
to exploit developing countries.

1466
01:30:19,694 --> 01:30:21,559
The only problem with an honest buck

1467
01:30:21,796 --> 01:30:23,388
is they're so hard to make.

1468
01:30:23,631 --> 01:30:24,928
The margins are too low.

1469
01:30:25,166 --> 01:30:26,997
Too many people are doing it.

1470
01:30:30,938 --> 01:30:34,499
Still, I'd promised Ava.

1471
01:30:43,050 --> 01:30:46,213
Yuri, the President of Liberia
is on his way up.

1472
01:30:48,355 --> 01:30:49,720
He's early.

1473
01:30:50,758 --> 01:30:52,191
I'll be back in a minute.

1474
01:30:59,200 --> 01:31:01,327
What the fuck are you doing here, Andre?

1475
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:03,366
We are here for peace talks at the
United Nations.

1476
01:31:03,604 --> 01:31:04,229
So at the same time you thought

1477
01:31:04,472 --> 01:31:05,769
you'd drop in on your arms dealer?

1478
01:31:06,006 --> 01:31:06,938
Well, I was beginning to wonder

1479
01:31:07,174 --> 01:31:09,404
whether that was still your profession.

1480
01:31:09,643 --> 01:31:10,200
You know, you're a hard man

1481
01:31:10,444 --> 01:31:12,810
to get a hold of all of Sudden.

1482
01:31:13,047 --> 01:31:14,571
That is a shame.

1483
01:31:14,815 --> 01:31:18,307
My son and I were hoping to do
a little shopping.

1484
01:31:18,552 --> 01:31:19,644
While in New York.

1485
01:31:19,887 --> 01:31:20,717
You know they're watching you.

1486
01:31:20,955 --> 01:31:22,479
Yes, I know they blame me.

1487
01:31:22,723 --> 01:31:25,123
They blame me for everything,
those hypocrites.

1488
01:31:25,359 --> 01:31:27,054
There're hunt for a witch.

1489
01:31:27,294 --> 01:31:28,488
Witch hunt.

1490
01:31:28,729 --> 01:31:31,095
Hostilities have escalated.

1491
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:34,495
And they are making it very
difficult for me to re-supply.

1492
01:31:34,735 --> 01:31:40,367
That requires a man of your rare ingenuity.

1493
01:31:42,209 --> 01:31:44,040
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

1494
01:31:50,985 --> 01:31:52,316
I understand.

1495
01:31:54,321 --> 01:31:55,982
But you should know this:

1496
01:31:56,223 --> 01:31:57,451
Due to our present situation

1497
01:31:57,691 --> 01:32:02,025
we are compelled to be unusually generous.

1498
01:32:06,801 --> 01:32:11,295
So, see you soon, Lord of War.

1499
01:32:14,809 --> 01:32:18,575
You still haven't brought me
the gun of Rambo.

1500
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:36,325
At four and a half months old...

1501
01:32:36,564 --> 01:32:39,328
a human fetus has a reptile's tail...

1502
01:32:39,567 --> 01:32:41,398
a remnant of our evolution.

1503
01:32:41,635 --> 01:32:43,535
Maybe that's what I couldn't escape.

1504
01:32:43,771 --> 01:32:45,966
You can fight a lot of enemies and survive,

1505
01:32:46,207 --> 01:32:47,970
but if you fight your biology,

1506
01:32:48,209 --> 01:32:49,198
you always lose.

1507
01:32:49,443 --> 01:32:50,637
You guys aren't waiting to say goodbye?

1508
01:32:50,878 --> 01:32:52,106
I'm not leaving for another ten minutes.

1509
01:32:52,346 --> 01:32:55,372
Sorry, Nicki has swim practice.

1510
01:32:55,616 --> 01:32:57,311
You know, I'm kind of glad you're going.

1511
01:32:57,551 --> 01:32:58,142
You've been here so long

1512
01:32:58,385 --> 01:33:00,250
you're starting to get on my nerves.

1513
01:33:00,487 --> 01:33:02,421
This oil concession should be
wrapped up by Thursday.

1514
01:33:02,656 --> 01:33:03,782
I'll be back for the weekend.

1515
01:33:04,024 --> 01:33:04,922
We'll go somewhere.

1516
01:33:05,159 --> 01:33:06,023
The sea.

1517
01:33:06,260 --> 01:33:07,557
That would be fun.

1518
01:33:08,529 --> 01:33:08,961
Come on.

1519
01:33:09,196 --> 01:33:12,597
Hey. You trust me, right?

1520
01:33:14,635 --> 01:33:15,863
She looked me directly in the eye...

1521
01:33:16,103 --> 01:33:16,865
the way I've looked in the eyes

1522
01:33:17,104 --> 01:33:18,628
of a thousand customs officials...

1523
01:33:18,873 --> 01:33:21,501
government bureaucrats and
law enforcement agents.

1524
01:33:21,742 --> 01:33:23,801
Yes, I trust you.

1525
01:33:24,044 --> 01:33:26,012
And she lied without flinching.

1526
01:33:26,580 --> 01:33:28,138
I'll see you, big guy.

1527
01:33:28,649 --> 01:33:30,048
Bye Papa.

1528
01:33:30,351 --> 01:33:31,784
She learned from the best.

1529
01:33:32,019 --> 01:33:33,247
Have a good trip.

1530
01:33:50,604 --> 01:33:51,764
That's him.

1531
01:34:12,393 --> 01:34:13,917
Where are we going, Mama?

1532
01:34:14,161 --> 01:34:15,185
It's a game, honey.

1533
01:34:15,429 --> 01:34:17,795
Like hide and seek?

1534
01:34:18,032 --> 01:34:19,124
Yes.

1535
01:34:20,634 --> 01:34:22,534
Like hide and seek.

1536
01:34:43,090 --> 01:34:45,183
I can always sense
when I'm being tailed.

1537
01:34:45,426 --> 01:34:47,053
I know what to look for.

1538
01:34:47,294 --> 01:34:50,092
But then I'd never been tailed
by the woman I love.

1539
01:35:02,576 --> 01:35:05,010
I can put myself in Ava's place.

1540
01:35:05,245 --> 01:35:06,644
She might've understood if the combination

1541
01:35:06,880 --> 01:35:09,144
was the last four digits of my
social security number...

1542
01:35:09,383 --> 01:35:10,611
my birth date, even her birth date,

1543
01:35:10,851 --> 01:35:12,443
but not Nicolai's.

1544
01:35:28,635 --> 01:35:29,932
My son's birthday unlocked

1545
01:35:30,170 --> 01:35:31,194
what the government would
later describe...

1546
01:35:31,438 --> 01:35:33,668
...as "a catalogue of carnage."

1547
01:35:44,084 --> 01:35:45,608
Nicki, stay right there.

1548
01:36:49,116 --> 01:36:50,310
Come on, Nicki.

1549
01:37:03,530 --> 01:37:05,157
Come to see how the other half lives?

1550
01:37:05,399 --> 01:37:07,094
I miss your borscht.

1551
01:37:07,334 --> 01:37:08,426
Mom and Dad say you're clean.

1552
01:37:08,669 --> 01:37:09,966
Yeah, you, too.

1553
01:37:11,505 --> 01:37:12,870
You went legit, huh?

1554
01:37:13,707 --> 01:37:15,072
That's hard to believe.

1555
01:37:15,309 --> 01:37:17,004
That's because it's not true.

1556
01:37:19,113 --> 01:37:19,977
Only you know.

1557
01:37:20,214 --> 01:37:21,909
I'm leaving tonight on a job

1558
01:37:22,149 --> 01:37:23,639
I want you to come.

1559
01:37:24,952 --> 01:37:29,514
I can't. I've got a girlfriend.

1560
01:37:30,357 --> 01:37:32,257
I think she might be the one.

1561
01:37:32,726 --> 01:37:35,456
Plus, I'm thinking of opening
my own place.

1562
01:37:35,696 --> 01:37:37,186
Maybe this trip will help.

1563
01:37:37,431 --> 01:37:38,796
It's good money.

1564
01:37:41,502 --> 01:37:45,404
Yuri, I've given my word.

1565
01:37:45,639 --> 01:37:47,197
No one has to know.

1566
01:37:47,441 --> 01:37:49,705
Tell them we going for a little R and R.

1567
01:37:52,813 --> 01:37:54,542
What do you need me for,
all of sudden?

1568
01:37:54,781 --> 01:37:56,612
West Africa's fucked up.

1569
01:37:57,084 --> 01:37:58,642
More than usual.

1570
01:37:59,453 --> 01:38:01,444
I can't trust anybody.

1571
01:38:04,358 --> 01:38:06,622
I need you to watch my back.

1572
01:38:09,029 --> 01:38:11,589
Brothers in arms.

1573
01:38:22,809 --> 01:38:28,111
Monrovia, Liberia - 2001

1574
01:38:45,232 --> 01:38:49,396
Yuri! Welcome back.

1575
01:38:51,705 --> 01:38:53,297
Welcome both of you.

1576
01:38:53,540 --> 01:38:55,235
Welcome to democracy.

1577
01:38:55,475 --> 01:38:56,271
Democracy?

1578
01:38:56,510 --> 01:38:57,772
What have you been drinking, Andy?

1579
01:38:58,011 --> 01:38:59,876
Huh, you have not seen the news.

1580
01:39:00,113 --> 01:39:02,274
You know they accuse me of
rigging elections.

1581
01:39:02,516 --> 01:39:06,714
But after this, with your Florida and
you Supreme Court of Kangaroos,

1582
01:39:06,954 --> 01:39:10,651
Now, the U.S. Must shut up forever.

1583
01:39:14,761 --> 01:39:16,285
How do you do this, Yuri?

1584
01:39:18,031 --> 01:39:19,362
How do you do this,

1585
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:22,831
when they are watching all of
my airspace?

1586
01:39:23,070 --> 01:39:24,662
Where there's a will,
there's a weapon.

1587
01:39:26,306 --> 01:39:28,035
Come on, where's my fucking money?

1588
01:39:32,779 --> 01:39:34,440
When it is delivered.

1589
01:39:36,316 --> 01:39:37,214
It is delivered.

1590
01:39:37,451 --> 01:39:39,043
This is not for me.

1591
01:39:39,286 --> 01:39:41,413
This is for my neighbors to the west.

1592
01:39:41,655 --> 01:39:42,644
The west?

1593
01:39:44,324 --> 01:39:45,723
We're going to Sierra Leone.

1594
01:39:45,959 --> 01:39:48,951
Oh, yes. And my son Baptiste Junior

1595
01:39:49,196 --> 01:39:52,495
will go with you to make the
proper introductions.

1596
01:39:52,733 --> 01:39:54,598
We have no trucks.

1597
01:39:54,835 --> 01:39:55,859
You will.

1598
01:39:56,103 --> 01:39:59,300
As soon as we get the food out of them.

1599
01:40:04,211 --> 01:40:05,872
Gun of Rambo.

1600
01:40:06,346 --> 01:40:09,645
Mr. Yuri, you're a man of your word.

1601
01:40:09,883 --> 01:40:11,441
So where are we going?

1602
01:40:11,685 --> 01:40:15,348
RUF - the Freedom Fighters.

1603
01:40:16,123 --> 01:40:19,524
Every faction in Africa calls
themselves by the noble names.

1604
01:40:19,760 --> 01:40:21,489
Liberation-this Patriotic-that,

1605
01:40:21,728 --> 01:40:24,356
Democratic Republic
of-something-or-other.

1606
01:40:27,768 --> 01:40:30,396
I guess they can't own up to
what they usually are

1607
01:40:30,637 --> 01:40:34,073
Federation of Worse Oppressors
than the Last Bunch of Oppressors.

1608
01:40:40,847 --> 01:40:42,712
Often, the most barbaric atrocities occur

1609
01:40:42,949 --> 01:40:46,578
when both combatants proclaim
themselves "freedom fighters."

1610
01:40:52,326 --> 01:40:56,228
Right, I've got 500 units, brand new
right out of the box,

1611
01:40:56,463 --> 01:40:59,193
all as clean as this. What have you got?

1612
01:41:16,717 --> 01:41:19,311
God! Oh, Jesus.

1613
01:41:22,189 --> 01:41:24,851
God! Oh, Jesus.

1614
01:41:28,161 --> 01:41:30,129
Yuri, I need to talk to you.

1615
01:41:30,364 --> 01:41:31,331
Not now.

1616
01:41:31,565 --> 01:41:32,623
Now.

1617
01:41:34,735 --> 01:41:35,895
Excuse me.

1618
01:41:43,677 --> 01:41:44,666
What?

1619
01:41:45,846 --> 01:41:48,076
We can't do this deal.
The fuck we can't!

1620
01:41:48,315 --> 01:41:49,009
What's the matter with you?

1621
01:41:49,249 --> 01:41:51,717
Look, over there.

1622
01:41:51,952 --> 01:41:54,716
As soon as we hand over the guns
those people are going to die!

1623
01:41:56,156 --> 01:41:59,216
It's not our business.

1624
01:42:00,260 --> 01:42:02,990
They killed a boy just now
as young as Nicki.

1625
01:42:06,933 --> 01:42:08,628
What is the holdup?

1626
01:42:08,869 --> 01:42:09,563
There is no holdup.

1627
01:42:09,803 --> 01:42:11,327
I'll be right there.

1628
01:42:11,571 --> 01:42:12,970
Vitaly, it's what we always know:

1629
01:42:13,206 --> 01:42:14,138
We can't control what they do.

1630
01:42:14,374 --> 01:42:17,275
No, no, today we can. Today we can.

1631
01:42:17,511 --> 01:42:18,944
Yuri, they're right there!

1632
01:42:19,179 --> 01:42:20,168
What do you think they'll do to us

1633
01:42:20,414 --> 01:42:22,473
if we back out? They'll kill us.

1634
01:42:22,716 --> 01:42:25,184
And if we go ahead, what do you
think they'll do to them?

1635
01:42:30,090 --> 01:42:31,455
We've got to do something.

1636
01:42:32,759 --> 01:42:34,386
Please, for fuck's sake.

1637
01:42:34,628 --> 01:42:35,754
It's not our fight.

1638
01:42:35,996 --> 01:42:38,464
Please. Brothers in arms.

1639
01:42:40,267 --> 01:42:41,564
What is he saying?

1640
01:42:42,269 --> 01:42:43,861
It's the deal.

1641
01:42:44,104 --> 01:42:45,264
My brother's not happy with the terms.

1642
01:42:45,505 --> 01:42:48,167
We'll work it out. It's nothing.

1643
01:42:56,116 --> 01:42:58,346
Right? It's nothing.

1644
01:43:04,524 --> 01:43:07,584
Yeah. Nothing.

1645
01:43:09,463 --> 01:43:11,693
You're right. Yuri, you're right.

1646
01:43:12,599 --> 01:43:15,090
God, I've got to get my shit together.

1647
01:43:16,203 --> 01:43:17,761
This is not our fight.

1648
01:43:18,004 --> 01:43:18,993
Right.

1649
01:43:19,239 --> 01:43:20,706
Okay. What's the deal?

1650
01:43:20,941 --> 01:43:26,436
300 RPGs, 500 assault rifles
and 800 grenades.

1651
01:43:28,281 --> 01:43:31,341
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1652
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,410
I was so caught up in the deal...

1653
01:43:35,655 --> 01:43:38,089
I never realized
what was going on in Vitaly's head.

1654
01:43:38,325 --> 01:43:40,691
I thought it was 1200 grenades.

1655
01:43:41,127 --> 01:43:41,991
Confused.

1656
01:43:42,229 --> 01:43:42,854
Come to think about it,

1657
01:43:43,096 --> 01:43:46,395
maybe I never understood what
was going on in his head.

1658
01:43:50,504 --> 01:43:51,937
I beg your pardon.

1659
01:43:52,172 --> 01:43:53,639
May I see another stone?

1660
01:43:53,874 --> 01:43:56,536
One thing I do understand
for certain...

1661
01:43:56,776 --> 01:43:59,870
...is that Vitaly broke the
cardinal rule of gunrunning.

1662
01:44:00,213 --> 01:44:03,182
Never pick up a gun and join
the customers.

1663
01:44:10,223 --> 01:44:11,622
What are you doing?

1664
01:44:15,495 --> 01:44:16,962
Something for Yuri.

1665
01:44:18,331 --> 01:44:21,232
Step away. Slow.

1666
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:41,053
No, Vit!

1667
01:44:42,989 --> 01:44:44,479
No! Vit!

1668
01:46:10,610 --> 01:46:12,134
Only half the guns were gone...

1669
01:46:12,379 --> 01:46:15,246
so I was still entitled to half the diamonds.

1670
01:46:15,749 --> 01:46:17,842
If I took them, I was lost.

1671
01:46:18,084 --> 01:46:20,416
If I left them, I was lost.

1672
01:46:28,595 --> 01:46:31,860
The massacre played out exactly
how Vitaly predicted.

1673
01:46:32,098 --> 01:46:33,622
But then, a half-dozen
other massacres

1674
01:46:33,867 --> 01:46:36,335
happened in Sierra Leone that week.

1675
01:46:36,569 --> 01:46:38,002
You can't stop them all.

1676
01:46:38,238 --> 01:46:41,332
In my experience,
you can't stop any of them.

1677
01:46:42,742 --> 01:46:46,405
They say evil prevails
when good men fail to act.

1678
01:46:46,646 --> 01:46:50,742
What they ought to say is,
evil prevails.

1679
01:47:04,397 --> 01:47:06,024
I now shared even more in common...

1680
01:47:06,266 --> 01:47:09,724
with the leader of that country God
seemed to have forsaken.

1681
01:47:09,969 --> 01:47:12,995
We saw something in each other
that neither of us liked.

1682
01:47:13,239 --> 01:47:16,208
Or maybe we were just looking
in the mirror.

1683
01:47:35,829 --> 01:47:37,854
I paid a Monrovian doctor
twenty dollars

1684
01:47:38,098 --> 01:47:39,861
to remove the lead from
Vitaly's body

1685
01:47:40,100 --> 01:47:43,001
and write a bogus death certificate.

1686
01:47:43,236 --> 01:47:44,863
I should've paid more.

1687
01:47:45,105 --> 01:47:47,039
I've smuggled millions of
rounds of ammunition,

1688
01:47:47,273 --> 01:47:48,968
and the bullet that lands me in jail...

1689
01:47:49,209 --> 01:47:51,803
is found under my dead brother's rib.

1690
01:47:53,346 --> 01:47:55,143
Yuri Orlov.

1691
01:47:55,381 --> 01:47:58,214
We're with the Bureau of Alcohol,
Tobacco, and Firearms.

1692
01:47:58,451 --> 01:47:59,145
Let me guess.

1693
01:47:59,385 --> 01:48:02,081
This is not about the alcohol or
the tobacco.

1694
01:48:43,730 --> 01:48:44,992
Crimean Restaurant.

1695
01:48:45,231 --> 01:48:46,562
Papa?

1696
01:48:53,673 --> 01:48:56,369
Both my sons are dead.

1697
01:48:59,179 --> 01:49:01,773
There are only two tragedies in life.

1698
01:49:02,015 --> 01:49:04,142
One is not getting what you want.

1699
01:49:04,384 --> 01:49:05,578
The other is getting it.

1700
01:49:05,819 --> 01:49:06,649
Is this one of yours?

1701
01:49:06,886 --> 01:49:09,684
Jack Valentine finally had
what he wanted.

1702
01:49:09,923 --> 01:49:14,587
Curiously, the death certificate says
he died of heart failure.

1703
01:49:15,328 --> 01:49:17,626
Falsifying a death certificate?

1704
01:49:17,864 --> 01:49:19,627
That's not gonna hold me.

1705
01:49:19,866 --> 01:49:23,461
You're right. As usual, you are right.

1706
01:49:25,972 --> 01:49:29,305
Have you seen today's paper? Huh?

1707
01:49:35,548 --> 01:49:37,038
Fake end-user certificates.

1708
01:49:37,283 --> 01:49:40,411
Cut-out companies,
meticulously catalogued.

1709
01:49:40,653 --> 01:49:44,589
There is hardly a warlord, dictator,
despot anywhere in the world

1710
01:49:44,824 --> 01:49:46,883
that you're a first-name basis with.

1711
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:52,354
It was your wife your trophy wife
that led us to the prize.

1712
01:49:53,166 --> 01:49:53,757
It's not her fault.

1713
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,366
She's just easier to follow
than you are.

1714
01:49:58,204 --> 01:49:59,728
May I?

1715
01:49:59,973 --> 01:50:01,463
Yeah, go ahead.

1716
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:27,427
Enjoy it.

1717
01:50:28,167 --> 01:50:30,192
What? This.

1718
01:50:30,803 --> 01:50:33,101
Tell me I'm everything you despise.

1719
01:50:33,339 --> 01:50:35,773
That I'm the personification of evil.

1720
01:50:36,009 --> 01:50:36,873
What?

1721
01:50:37,110 --> 01:50:41,774
Responsible for the breakdown of
the fabric of society and world order.

1722
01:50:42,015 --> 01:50:44,449
I'm a one-man genocide.

1723
01:50:44,684 --> 01:50:46,652
Say everything you want to say
to me now.

1724
01:50:47,387 --> 01:50:49,252
Because you don't have long.

1725
01:50:49,489 --> 01:50:51,150
Are you paying attention?

1726
01:50:52,058 --> 01:50:54,424
Or are you delusional?

1727
01:50:54,661 --> 01:50:57,892
You have broken every arms
embargo written.

1728
01:50:58,131 --> 01:51:02,329
There is enough here to put you away
for consecutive life sentences.

1729
01:51:02,568 --> 01:51:04,126
You are going to spend
the next ten years of your life

1730
01:51:04,370 --> 01:51:07,601
going from a cell to a courtroom
before you even start

1731
01:51:07,840 --> 01:51:09,364
serving your time.

1732
01:51:11,978 --> 01:51:14,344
I don't think you fully
appreciate the seriousness...

1733
01:51:14,580 --> 01:51:16,309
...of your situation.

1734
01:51:26,392 --> 01:51:29,361
My family has disowned me.

1735
01:51:30,630 --> 01:51:33,599
My wife and son have left me.

1736
01:51:36,369 --> 01:51:38,030
My brother's dead.

1737
01:51:38,905 --> 01:51:40,304
Trust me.

1738
01:51:40,540 --> 01:51:44,135
I fully appreciate the seriousness
of my situation.

1739
01:51:44,377 --> 01:51:46,345
But I promise you,

1740
01:51:46,579 --> 01:51:49,480
I won't spend a single second
in a courtroom.

1741
01:51:50,416 --> 01:51:51,883
You are delusional.

1742
01:51:52,552 --> 01:51:54,042
I like you, Jack.

1743
01:51:54,988 --> 01:51:59,015
Well, maybe not,
but I understand you.

1744
01:52:02,228 --> 01:52:04,662
Let me tell you what's gonna happen.

1745
01:52:05,498 --> 01:52:09,025
This way, you can prepare yourself.

1746
01:52:12,505 --> 01:52:13,563
Okay.

1747
01:52:13,806 --> 01:52:15,364
Soon there's going to be
a knock on that door

1748
01:52:15,608 --> 01:52:17,007
and you will be called outside.

1749
01:52:17,243 --> 01:52:19,609
In the hall there will be
a man who outranks you.

1750
01:52:19,846 --> 01:52:22,906
First, he'll compliment you on the
fine job you've done

1751
01:52:23,149 --> 01:52:25,117
that you're making the world
a safer place

1752
01:52:25,351 --> 01:52:29,788
that you're to receive
a commendation and a promotion.

1753
01:52:30,023 --> 01:52:32,685
And then he'll tell you that
I am to be released.

1754
01:52:32,925 --> 01:52:34,790
You're gonna protest.

1755
01:52:35,294 --> 01:52:38,127
You'll probably threaten to resign.

1756
01:52:38,364 --> 01:52:41,128
But in the end, I will be released.

1757
01:52:41,434 --> 01:52:43,732
The reason I'll be released
is the same reason you think...

1758
01:52:43,970 --> 01:52:45,904
I'll be convicted.

1759
01:52:46,139 --> 01:52:48,801
I do rub shoulders with some of
the most vile,

1760
01:52:49,042 --> 01:52:52,239
sadistic men calling themselves
leaders today.

1761
01:52:53,379 --> 01:52:59,784
But some of those men are
the enemies of your enemies.

1762
01:53:00,820 --> 01:53:04,779
And while the biggest arms dealer
in the world is your boss...

1763
01:53:05,024 --> 01:53:06,821
...the President of the United States,

1764
01:53:07,060 --> 01:53:08,652
who ships more merchandise in a day

1765
01:53:08,895 --> 01:53:11,193
I do in a year...

1766
01:53:11,831 --> 01:53:16,200
sometimes it's embarrassing to have
his fingerprints on the guns.

1767
01:53:16,436 --> 01:53:19,269
Sometimes he needs a freelancer like me

1768
01:53:19,505 --> 01:53:20,437
to supply forces

1769
01:53:20,673 --> 01:53:28,944
he can't be seen supplying.
So... you call me evil,

1770
01:53:29,182 --> 01:53:34,017
but unfortunately for you,
I'm a necessary evil.

1771
01:53:49,936 --> 01:53:52,370
I would tell you to go to hell.

1772
01:53:53,406 --> 01:53:55,601
But I think you're already there.

1773
01:54:30,276 --> 01:54:32,244
Pleasure doing business with you.

1774
01:54:32,478 --> 01:54:34,878
Most people are happy
just to get out of jail.

1775
01:54:35,114 --> 01:54:37,548
I expect to be paid to leave.

1776
01:54:37,783 --> 01:54:38,772
I'm not a fool.

1777
01:54:39,018 --> 01:54:40,747
I know that just because they
needed me that day

1778
01:54:40,987 --> 01:54:43,888
didn't mean they wouldn't make
me a scapegoat the next.

1779
01:54:44,123 --> 01:54:45,647
But I was back,

1780
01:54:45,892 --> 01:54:47,826
doing what I do best.

1781
01:54:48,161 --> 01:54:49,685
Umbrellas to the Sahara?

1782
01:54:49,929 --> 01:54:51,556
Sun umbrellas.

1783
01:55:10,383 --> 01:55:12,817
You know who's going to
inherit the Earth?

1784
01:55:13,052 --> 01:55:14,485
Arms dealers.

1785
01:55:14,720 --> 01:55:17,951
Because everyone else
is too busy killing each other.

1786
01:55:18,191 --> 01:55:20,250
That's the secret to survival.

1787
01:55:20,493 --> 01:55:22,017
Never go to war.

1788
01:55:25,331 --> 01:55:27,526
Especially with yourself.
