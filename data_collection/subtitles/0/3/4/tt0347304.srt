1
00:01:15,500 --> 00:01:20,289
New york... one of the biggest cities
in the world

2
00:01:21,064 --> 00:01:22,592
Business capital of the world.

3
00:01:23,741 --> 00:01:26,372
Every breath of the city...every
heartbeat is filled with speed

4
00:01:33,511 --> 00:01:35,455
People are always in a hurry here...

5
00:01:36,292 --> 00:01:39,173
in a hurry to leave home...in a hurry
to reach the office...

6
00:01:39,874 --> 00:01:42,233
always in a hurry to be a
step or two ahead of life

7
00:01:43,142 --> 00:01:45,537
There is no place for anyone
who can't cope here

8
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,839
Miles away from lndia, this city
is infested with lndians

9
00:01:53,817 --> 00:01:56,662
ln fact they say every fourth face
in New y ork is an lndian

10
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:57,875
One more thing...

11
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:00,657
Oh... by the way that's me!

12
00:03:01,758 --> 00:03:04,224
This city taught me
to be independent...

13
00:03:04,853 --> 00:03:06,904
it taught me to fulfill my responsibilities...

14
00:03:07,287 --> 00:03:08,983
taught me to face life...

15
00:03:10,034 --> 00:03:11,421
...but it couldn't teach me to love...

16
00:03:12,781 --> 00:03:13,468
where was the time?

17
00:03:14,624 --> 00:03:16,212
Whenever l watched the
city from far...

18
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:18,751
I feIt Papa Was cIoser

19
00:03:21,509 --> 00:03:24,424
Whenever l missed him,
l came here

20
00:03:28,741 --> 00:03:34,087
l am Naina Catherine Kapur
and this is my story

21
00:03:41,084 --> 00:03:42,151
I understand Mr.Shah,

22
00:03:42,405 --> 00:03:44,136
but try and understand my probIem

23
00:03:45,361 --> 00:03:47,577
I must have the Ioan extension, pIease.

24
00:03:49,673 --> 00:03:51,818
I knoW the restaurant
is centraIIy situated.

25
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:54,915
But there's competition
around, Mr. Shah...

26
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:58,707
My mother, Jennifer.
After Papa passed away...

27
00:03:59,095 --> 00:04:01,241
the entire responsibility
of the family fell on her

28
00:04:01,842 --> 00:04:05,315
But she never allowed us to ever
feel the burden of her sorrows

29
00:04:06,258 --> 00:04:09,518
Thank you...I.
- I'm home.

30
00:04:11,508 --> 00:04:12,516
Where Were you?

31
00:04:13,873 --> 00:04:14,808
CentraI Park

32
00:04:15,402 --> 00:04:16,374
CentraI Park? Why?

33
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:18,633
To meet someone.
- Who?

34
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:19,674
To meet my boyfriend...

35
00:04:20,444 --> 00:04:24,048
BiII...biIIs...biIIs Private & confidentiaI.

36
00:04:24,338 --> 00:04:25,061
That's mine.

37
00:04:25,625 --> 00:04:27,427
What is this?
It's SWeetu's maiI again

38
00:04:27,711 --> 00:04:29,513
When WiII the maiIman understand
that We are Kapur With a 'U'...

39
00:04:29,798 --> 00:04:31,350
and they are Kapoor With an 'O'?
He aIWays...

40
00:04:32,579 --> 00:04:33,266
Were you crying?

41
00:04:33,692 --> 00:04:35,185
No... you Were crying...

42
00:04:35,848 --> 00:04:36,571
No mom.

43
00:04:36,821 --> 00:04:40,402
My mother and l...
We lied to each other everyday

44
00:04:40,785 --> 00:04:41,793
KunWari kudi

45
00:04:42,976 --> 00:04:45,086
KunWari kudi marriage bureau,
What's this?

46
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,655
Why don't you ask your grandmother?

47

48
00:04:49,339 --> 00:04:52,042
But I don't Want to get married...
Why doesn't Dadi Ieave me aIone?

49
00:04:52,294 --> 00:04:53,503
Why doesn't she just Ieave?

50
00:04:54,206 --> 00:04:55,865
MomI Where's she?

51
00:04:56,466 --> 00:04:57,438
It's going to be eight...

52
00:04:59,179 --> 00:05:00,732
Hi Guys, 10 seconds to go.

53
00:05:03,386 --> 00:05:05,437
8 seconds to go.

00:05:06,133 --> 00:05:09,251
4,3,2,1 ....bang.

55
00:05:09,853 --> 00:05:12,425
My grandmother Lajjo...
She had three dreams

56
00:05:12,878 --> 00:05:15,202
One that New y ork
becomes a part of Punjab

57
00:05:15,521 --> 00:05:19,587
Two, that l marry a Sardar
and three... that my mother dies

58
00:05:20,076 --> 00:05:24,415
SarasWatiji, Lata, Asha and Usha have
served you With their music for years

59
00:05:25,117 --> 00:05:29,871
But from today Kammo,

The Words are 'Pritam come hither...'

63
00:05:41,146 --> 00:05:44,300
The song is speciaIIy requested by
our neighbour, Chaddaji from Queens...

64
00:05:46,049 --> 00:05:47,057
That's very kind of you

65
00:05:48,031 --> 00:05:50,627
Kammo... Vimmo...

66
00:05:52,378 --> 00:05:53,587
Go Lajjo...

67
00:05:53,838 --> 00:05:54,454
Go Lajjo...

68
00:05:54,707 --> 00:05:59,331
''Pritam, come hither...''

69
00:06:00,166 --> 00:06:05,026
''Pritam, come hither...''

70
00:06:05,278 --> 00:06:09,273
''My sad heart caIIs out to you...''

71
00:06:09,554 --> 00:06:15,708
''Pritam, come hither...
Come hither... Come hither...''

72
00:06:15,952 --> 00:06:19,591
DadiI....Stop it.

73
00:06:20,020 --> 00:06:21,892
Oh GodI Interrupted our prayers?

74
00:06:22,142 --> 00:06:23,279
InsuIted the goddess?

75
00:06:23,532 --> 00:06:24,218
Don't you have any shame?

76
00:06:24,471 --> 00:06:25,538
Don't you have any shame?

77
00:06:25,792 --> 00:06:27,487
Singing 'Come hither'
'Come hither' to Chaddaji?

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:30,311
Who's singing it to Chaddaji?
We are singing 'Pritam, come hither'

79
00:06:30,555 --> 00:06:32,630
What is his first name?

80
00:06:34,797 --> 00:06:35,521
And What is this?

81
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:37,119
What? - This.

82
00:06:38,239 --> 00:06:40,670
WoWI Pictures from KunWari KudiI

83
00:06:40,918 --> 00:06:43,241
AII three of them are so goodIooking

84
00:06:43,490 --> 00:06:45,019
Three? They Iook
Iike the same guy

85
00:06:45,298 --> 00:06:46,163
No, no my chiId...
they are different

86
00:06:46,446 --> 00:06:48,354
NoW What is that KunWari kudi ad?

87
00:06:50,027 --> 00:06:53,121
''Hey girI, Hey GirI, hey GirI...

88
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,893
''Choose one, tWo or three''

89
00:06:57,468 --> 00:07:00,941
Dadi, I am not interested in marrying
anyone... one tWo or three

90
00:07:01,223 --> 00:07:03,547
If you don't marry, my chiId,
hoW WiII you have chiIdren?

91
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:06,333
I can have my chiIdren.
There's no need to marry

92
00:07:11,376 --> 00:07:13,664
My brother Shiv, a handicap.

93
00:07:14,019 --> 00:07:16,687
He couldn't play basketball
like the other boys...

94
00:07:16,974 --> 00:07:20,068
but he could be quite irritating
like the other boys

95
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,430
Shiv, put off the T.V.

96
00:07:22,746 --> 00:07:24,204
Whenever I see,
it's aIWays basketbaIII

97
00:07:24,554 --> 00:07:27,091
Just because I can't pIay
doesn't mean I can't see...

98
00:07:27,753 --> 00:07:30,147
Don't get cute With me.
AII right. Hurry up.

99
00:07:30,395 --> 00:07:31,639
Gia, heIp your brother.

100
00:07:31,925 --> 00:07:34,983
Didi, did you see my neW doIIs?
- GiaI

101
00:07:35,228 --> 00:07:38,002
This is Mama, this is you...

102
00:07:39,123 --> 00:07:42,560
this is bhaiyya, this is me and...

103
00:07:42,808 --> 00:07:44,646
Oh, so you are aWake...I

104
00:07:45,173 --> 00:07:46,382
Looking so good...
Iike Hari Putter...

105
00:07:46,634 --> 00:07:48,471
Harry Potter, dadi...

106
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:49,479
Ya ya... Whatever... Hari, Harry...

107
00:07:49,728 --> 00:07:51,423
Good morning, dadi.
- Ya Ya...

108
00:07:51,744 --> 00:07:52,503
What's your scheduIe today?

109
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:56,013
Dadi's love for Shiv was only
matched by her hatred for Gia

110
00:07:56,856 --> 00:08:01,894
Gia was adopted and probably that's why
Dadi did not consider her, our own

111
00:08:02,385 --> 00:08:06,830
And Gia... She always kept the
Dadi doll away from her perfect family

112
00:08:07,809 --> 00:08:09,397
Distance was not just
between the two in the family...

113
00:08:09,825 --> 00:08:12,705
Guru Nanak and Jesus had
their own battle in the house

114
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:20,598
It's so coIdI Is the heater on?

115
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:21,950
You are aIWays on, aren't you?

116
00:08:22,204 --> 00:08:23,342
What?- NothingI

117
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,746
WiII it?- Shut up.

118
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:28,183
Bet? - Don't irritate me.

119
00:08:28,463 --> 00:08:30,015
Chicken is just 1 doIIar.

120
00:08:30,549 --> 00:08:32,730
What's for breakfast?
- Fruit and cereaI

121
00:08:33,018 --> 00:08:34,890
What? - CereaI...

122
00:08:35,208 --> 00:08:37,259
Has it started? The seriaI
Kahani Ghar Ghar Ki...?

123
00:08:38,024 --> 00:08:40,454
Not the TV seriaI...
the cereaI We eat

124
00:08:40,702 --> 00:08:43,547
So What's neW?
That We eat everyday

125
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,994
Poor daughter-in-IaW... she doesn't
knoW hoW to make Indian food

126
00:08:48,178 --> 00:08:49,636
Our dear daughter-in-IaW, Jenny

127
00:08:51,898 --> 00:08:52,727
Do you knoW, Naina?

128
00:08:52,975 --> 00:08:55,299
I saW a IoveIy dream Iast night

129
00:08:55,584 --> 00:08:58,499
In the dream, I Was eating
hot aIoo parathas...

130
00:08:59,616 --> 00:09:03,090
With Iots of White butter
Oh... hoW I missed ChandigarhI

131
00:09:03,372 --> 00:09:05,696
If you miss Chandigarh so much
then you must go aWay there

132
00:09:05,979 --> 00:09:06,631
What do you think Naina?

133
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:12,028
I'm going noWhere. If I Ieave,
What WiII happen to these chiIdren?

134
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,558
I'm very concerned about them

135
00:09:14,811 --> 00:09:17,442
And I'm concerned onIy about them

136
00:09:17,697 --> 00:09:19,499
Yes of course... Why WouId
you be concerned about me?

137
00:09:19,748 --> 00:09:22,380
Who am I to you?
If onIy my son Was aIive today...

138
00:09:22,635 --> 00:09:23,180
OnIy if he Was aIive...

139
00:09:23,434 --> 00:09:25,307
Stop it. Just stop it.

140
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:29,687
Here's your doIIar. You Won.
As usuaI, are you happy noW?

141
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:32,221
And both of you...just forget it.

142
00:09:32,788 --> 00:09:34,839
My morning began
this same way everyday

143
00:09:35,326 --> 00:09:40,009
Mama and Dadi's fight,
followed by my angry walkout...

144
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,938
and then listening to my stupid
neighbour, Sweetu's stupid chatter

145
00:09:44,957 --> 00:09:46,486
Oh HiI- One minute.

146
00:09:46,765 --> 00:09:49,396

148
00:09:50,869 --> 00:09:51,734
And What WiII you have?

149
00:09:51,981 --> 00:09:56,533
Sweetu. Full name, Jasprit Kapoor...
Kapoor with two '0's.

150
00:09:56,884 --> 00:09:59,029
my neighbour....
& unfortunately best friend.

151
00:09:59,352 --> 00:10:02,470
She has two problems.
The weight that she never loses...

152
00:10:02,725 --> 00:10:04,669
and the fact that she
never feels sad about it

153
00:10:04,916 --> 00:10:07,488
TeII, Na...
- One doubIe expresso pIease.

But today, he's my friend...

Basically, he's a nice guy and

She hates me.
- No darIing, she doesn't hates you.

294
00:19:08,275 --> 00:19:09,519
She hates you.

295
00:19:11,195 --> 00:19:12,582
Don't say that...

296
00:19:13,351 --> 00:19:16,409

301
00:19:33,796 --> 00:19:37,340
AngeI?- AngeI darIing, AngeII

Today, in our prayers Iet's ask
Jesus for our angeI... OK?

What are you doing?

675
00:43:21,091 --> 00:43:22,750
Didn't you just say that I shouId

676
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:23,974
So may I have haIf a cup of miIk?

677
00:43:25,507 --> 00:43:26,052
So funny.

678
00:43:26,306 --> 00:43:28,843
See... pIease take this
happy-go-Iucky nature...

679
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:30,581
and knock on someone eIse's door

680
00:43:31,069 --> 00:43:34,401
And We're genuineIy
not interested.

681
00:43:34,651 --> 00:43:36,488
What happened?
- What's your probIem?

682
00:43:37,432 --> 00:43:40,656
ProbIem?- Yes... Why do you feeI...
that the entire Weight of the WorId

683
00:43:40,910 --> 00:43:41,881

684
00:43:42,127 --> 00:43:43,098

00:43:44,213 --> 00:43:45,351
Don't...

686
00:43:46,994 --> 00:43:48,653
What's the point of
praying to God...

687
00:43:48,942 --> 00:43:50,673
When you don't knoW hoW to vaIue
the Iife he has given?

688
00:43:50,958 --> 00:43:53,626
What do you knoW
about my Iife anyway?

689
00:43:53,914 --> 00:43:55,751
Not much, but enough to say..

690
00:43:56,070 --> 00:43:58,357
that in your eyes perhaps
you don't have much

691
00:43:58,608 --> 00:44:00,445
But Iook at your Iife
through someone eIse's eyes...

692
00:44:00,695 --> 00:44:03,054
and you'II knoW you have a IotI

693

Listen... Live... be happy..
SmiIe... Who knoWs?

694
00:44:06,605 --> 00:44:07,743
TomorroW may not be...

695
00:44:09,422 --> 00:44:10,181
What a thought.

696
00:44:10,430 --> 00:44:12,267
TomorroW may not be...
Oh, It is too good.

697
00:44:13,038 --> 00:44:15,053
Anyway, I WiII teach you to smiIe

698
00:44:15,298 --> 00:44:16,436
It is a simpIe 3 parts process.

699
00:44:19,297 --> 00:44:19,912
Try...

700
00:44:22,982 --> 00:44:26,349
Try...- Don't touch me.

701
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:28,609
God... the poor thing has
forgotten hoW to smiIe

702
00:44:28,893 --> 00:44:31,252
Just keep practicing
and it WiII come back

703
00:44:31,848 --> 00:44:34,208
Your probIem is that you think..

704
00:44:34,457 --> 00:44:36,116
I knoWI I am very sexy.

705
00:44:38,629 --> 00:44:44,818
But you are not my type
For noW, just practise

706
00:44:45,062 --> 00:44:46,377
Forget it. I am sorry.

707
00:44:48,886 --> 00:44:52,040
I kept thinking the WhoIe night...
Was that idiotic Aman right?

708
00:44:53,059 --> 00:44:55,346
Had I reaIIy forgotten to smiIe?

709
00:44:57,335 --> 00:45:00,216
Of course she smiIe
The Iast time she smiIed When.... Uh

Uh...uh...

Whenever she Was With her
father, she smiIed...

713
00:45:10,235 --> 00:45:11,206
Uh...uh...

714
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:13,468
When the big brother threatens her...
that's When she WiII smiIe

715
00:45:15,973 --> 00:45:17,810
What a beautifuI smiIeI

Whose?- Priya...Who eIse?

717

00:45:25,187 --> 00:45:26,467
Where did you find it?

719
00:45:27,133 --> 00:45:28,591

Aren't you scared?- I'm not scared

You can do aII this but you

00:49:07,683 --> 00:49:09,520
Naina, try to understand.

00:49:09,769 --> 00:49:12,472
Gita says she Iikes me...

00:49:12,725 --> 00:49:14,040
After aII she's found

819
00:50:51,334 --> 00:50:52,827
By the Way, Where did you tWo meet?

820
00:50:53,072 --> 00:50:54,731
In the park...- Park?

821
00:50:54,985 --> 00:50:55,779
In the park?

822
00:50:57,072 --> 00:50:59,952
But I thought you tWo studied

00:51:02,808 --> 00:51:06,211
Of course you can meet... but What
Were you doing in the park?

825
00:51:06,460 --> 00:51:07,360
Very good question.

826
00:51:08,336 --> 00:51:12,568
I had taken my doggy for a WaIk...

827
00:51:12,822 --> 00:51:14,316
and she had taken her doggy for a WaIk...

828
00:51:15,430 --> 00:51:16,224
That's strange.

829
00:51:16,473 --> 00:51:17,966
But Naina doesn't have a doggy

830
00:51:18,212 --> 00:51:18,828
Yes.- No.

831
00:51:19,255 --> 00:51:21,614
I had taken my neighbour's doggy
for a WaIk

832
00:51:21,897 --> 00:51:22,655
That's stranger.

833
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,086
I'm your neighbour.
And I don't have a doggy

834
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:28,737
Naina, you siIIy siIIy girI

00:51:29,026 --> 00:51:32,250

Rohit, you siIIy siIIy boy.

837
00:51:34,588 --> 00:51:35,903
If she took your doggy for a WaIk

838
00:51:36,153 --> 00:51:38,169
Then Whose doggy did you
take for a WaIk?

839
00:51:39,978 --> 00:51:41,993

Red underwear...- Aman,

1021
01:04:17,349 --> 01:04:18,664
You can't read my diary.

1022
01:04:29,519 --> 01:04:30,657

01:04:55,388 --> 01:04:56,359
I Want to say something to you

1033
01:04:56,605 --> 01:04:57,399
I don't Want to Iisten to anything

1034
01:04:58,518 --> 01:04:59,655
You shouIdn't say 'no'
in God's house

1035
01:04:59,909 --> 01:05:01,047
I...- Shut up.

1036
01:05:03,385 --> 01:05:05,044
Last night, for the
first time I feIt...

1037
01:05:05,645 --> 01:05:06,960
that you are Iike
aII other girIs

1038
01:05:07,211 --> 01:05:09,914
But for some reason, you Want
to hide the girI in you

1039
01:05:11,556 --> 01:05:14,780
And one more thing. Wherever he is,

1040
01:05:15,590 --> 01:05:16,348
your Papa is Iooking at you...

1041
01:05:17,502 --> 01:05:19,648
your anger... your sorroW...
he's Watching everything

1042
01:05:20,283 --> 01:05:22,951
And perhaps he's crying
With you too

1043
01:05:23,935 --> 01:05:25,594
NoW you can't Wipe his tears
from here...

1044
01:05:27,412 --> 01:05:31,514
but you can stop them
by smiIing and Iaughing

1045
01:05:31,932 --> 01:05:33,804
With your dimpIe oops
Wrong side...this side.

1046
01:05:34,887 --> 01:05:36,025
Come on, come on.

1047
01:05:37,669 --> 01:05:38,640
And Naina, pIease Ieave my hand...

1048
01:05:39,407 --> 01:05:40,201
What WiII peopIe say?

1049
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:45,695
May I sWeet heart?

1050
01:05:52,585 --> 01:05:55,253
Aman Mathur's magic was
spreading in all the directions...

1051
01:05:56,063 --> 01:05:57,378
whether they liked it or not,

1052
01:05:57,975 --> 01:05:59,634
Everyone was being swept off their feet

1053
01:06:02,390 --> 01:06:04,406
On Aman's insistence Dadi, Kammo
and Vimmo had given up their music...

1054
01:06:04,929 --> 01:06:07,632
and had embraced a new passion to...

1055
01:06:07,884 --> 01:06:13,895
... KiII us... AIIah... KiII us...

1056
01:06:14,143 --> 01:06:16,158
ExceIIent, What a performanceI

1057
01:06:16,925 --> 01:06:18,099
And while this was
the situation upstairs...

1058
01:06:18,489 --> 01:06:19,912
downstairs was a cookery special...

1059
01:06:20,159 --> 01:06:20,810
HaIf a spoon...

1060
01:06:21,062 --> 01:06:22,070
No... FuII spoon...

1061
01:06:22,315 --> 01:06:24,010
HaIf...- FuII...

1062
01:06:24,261 --> 01:06:24,842
What are you...?

1063
01:06:37,683 --> 01:06:40,777
Aman could do anything... anything

1064
01:06:42,099 --> 01:06:44,873
Gia's perfect family
had a new entry

1065
01:06:45,158 --> 01:06:47,410
I Iove you.

1066
01:06:48,879 --> 01:06:50,538
And as for me...

1067
01:06:51,140 --> 01:06:55,763
l was laughing...l had learnt to smile

1068
01:06:57,675 --> 01:06:58,540
lt was scary

1069
01:06:59,449 --> 01:07:00,729
So much happiness...

1070
01:07:01,257 --> 01:07:03,059
what if sorrow was
just round the corner?.

1071
01:07:04,909 --> 01:07:05,489
What happened?

1072
01:07:08,212 --> 01:07:10,428
Why are you sitting quiet?
Has someone died?

1073
01:07:10,819 --> 01:07:11,684
Shut up Aman.

1074
01:07:13,532 --> 01:07:15,084
I need some more time

1075
01:07:15,687 --> 01:07:16,717
No... you can't get time

1076
01:07:16,974 --> 01:07:18,218
The restaurant is going to shut...
You have to order noW

1077
01:07:18,469 --> 01:07:19,784
I'm not taIking
about the restaurant...

1078
01:07:22,293 --> 01:07:23,265
It's not the time to joke

1079
01:07:23,511 --> 01:07:24,826
It's a serious probIem.

1080
01:07:25,945 --> 01:07:27,438
I had toId you before
you came to neW York...

1081
01:07:27,683 --> 01:07:29,864
What do you mean? Are you saying
I shouIdn't have come?

1082
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:31,089
When did I say that?

1083
01:07:31,333 --> 01:07:32,648
Isn't that What you are saying?

1084
01:07:36,062 --> 01:07:37,165
You don't understand.

1085
01:07:37,802 --> 01:07:40,338
I need time... Yours and mine

1086
01:07:40,583 --> 01:07:44,507
I understand Priya

1087
01:07:45,276 --> 01:07:47,422
I came to NeW York just for you...
because of you

1088
01:07:47,815 --> 01:07:49,830
NoW Whatever you say
I WiII do

1089
01:07:50,597 --> 01:07:55,043
And as for time...
aII my time is yours

1090
01:08:06,939 --> 01:08:08,776
If you don't mind.

1091
01:08:09,234 --> 01:08:11,035
Can I do something?
- God AImightyI

1092
01:08:11,320 --> 01:08:14,509
Such bad days that We have to
seek heIp from a Gujarati?

1093
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:16,986
Wonder Who's eviI eye
has faIIen on us...

1094
01:08:17,230 --> 01:08:18,368
Must be yours

1095
01:08:19,317 --> 01:08:22,897
And When did you ever heIp me
that you are feeIing bad today?

1096
01:08:23,142 --> 01:08:25,608
Mom pIease.
NoW the tWo of you pIease don't start

1097
01:08:26,028 --> 01:08:28,564
This is a serious probIem.
- With a simpIe soIution.

1098
01:08:28,810 --> 01:08:29,983
Shut up Aman.
It's our famiIy probIem

1099
01:08:30,236 --> 01:08:31,030
That's Why I'm saying

1100
01:08:31,487 --> 01:08:33,040
But We aren't...- Shut up specsy.

1101
01:08:34,442 --> 01:08:39,931
Jenny, this restaurant of yours
doesn't run... it shouIdn't

1102
01:08:40,284 --> 01:08:40,971
Why shouId it?

1103
01:08:41,744 --> 01:08:44,624
Just teII me What is avaiIabIe
in this restaurant...

1104
01:08:44,908 --> 01:08:46,923
that isn't avaiIabIe anywhere eIse
on this street? Zero.

1105
01:08:47,168 --> 01:08:48,271
Come here...

1106
01:08:48,906 --> 01:08:50,981
Why does that Chinese restaurant
do so WeII?

1107
01:08:54,262 --> 01:08:55,162
Indian-Chinese Brother Brother...

1108
01:08:55,409 --> 01:08:57,140
Bye Bye BIoody fooIs

1109
01:08:57,878 --> 01:08:59,300
The bIoody fooIs' restaurant Works...

1110
01:08:59,547 --> 01:09:00,412
because they have got their cuIture

1111
01:09:00,659 --> 01:09:01,974
and their country to this pIace...

1112
01:09:02,224 --> 01:09:03,089
Did I say Wrong?
- Not at aIII

1113
01:09:03,337 --> 01:09:04,759
We shouId do the same

1114
01:09:05,005 --> 01:09:08,752
We have a great advantage
Which We must make use of being Indians.

1115
01:09:09,004 --> 01:09:10,319
We must get India to NeW York.

1116
01:09:10,569 --> 01:09:12,644
Yes, incIuding, Gujarat.
- Yes I'm With you.

1117
01:09:13,176 --> 01:09:13,792
Right on.

1118
01:09:14,219 --> 01:09:16,235
We have to get India here...
bring it to this smaII street...

1119
01:09:16,480 --> 01:09:17,274
spread it in aII the directions.

1120
01:09:17,523 --> 01:09:19,466
I don't beIieve this nonsense.
- I toId you to shut up.

1121
01:09:19,991 --> 01:09:23,536
Because India can do anything...
anywhere... anytime

1122
01:09:23,817 --> 01:09:26,353
So Who are they?
- They are Chinese...

1123
01:09:26,598 --> 01:09:28,021
Chinese, Japanese... Whatever

1124
01:09:28,268 --> 01:09:31,326
But Aman...- No...Jenny... Try...

1125
01:09:32,335 --> 01:09:33,828
There's no harm in trying

1126
01:09:34,526 --> 01:09:38,343
because those Who try never Iose...
NeverI

1127
01:09:39,046 --> 01:09:41,120
Come on everybody come on India.

1128
01:09:41,376 --> 01:09:41,921
You're With me, come on.

1129
01:09:42,175 --> 01:09:45,127

01:11:21,723 --> 01:11:23,667
''keep marching on''

1159
01:11:59,970 --> 01:12:04,523
Excuse me ...are you open?
-YESIII

1160
01:12:39,887 --> 01:12:40,337
Why?

1161
01:12:41,208 --> 01:12:42,595
Yes... Why?

1162
01:12:43,365 --> 01:12:43,980
Why, What?

1163
01:12:45,451 --> 01:12:46,944
God knoWs Where you came from

1164
01:12:48,024 --> 01:12:49,268
and suddenIy so much around has changedI

1165
01:12:49,936 --> 01:12:52,260
I mean you don't even knoW us...

1166
01:12:52,474 --> 01:12:53,897
I just don't understand Why?

1167
01:12:54,178 --> 01:12:55,422
I did aII this for you

1168
01:12:57,828 --> 01:12:59,737
I did aII this because of you, Naina

1169
01:13:02,523 --> 01:13:03,838
Isn't that What you Wanted to hear?

1170
01:13:04,609 --> 01:13:05,403
No...no...

1171
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:07,039
even I Was saying it
just Iike that

1172
01:13:08,782 --> 01:13:11,840
Aman- Naina... Naina...

1173
01:13:12,606 --> 01:13:13,222
Eyes...

1174
01:13:15,735 --> 01:13:17,229
have you seen your mother's eyes?

1175
01:13:18,865 --> 01:13:20,003
There's a Iot of pain in them

1176
01:13:20,777 --> 01:13:24,001
Whatever I have done,
it's for those eyes

1177
01:13:25,263 --> 01:13:26,199
You knoW I have a probIem

1178
01:13:27,071 --> 01:13:30,367
I can't see any mother's
sorroW or pain

1179
01:13:31,348 --> 01:13:35,094
Because Mothers are strange

1180
01:13:36,459 --> 01:13:38,640

There's no such thing.

1421
01:29:22,182 --> 01:29:23,770
But When did I say Naina?

So What do you Want me to do?

01:29:48,052 --> 01:29:50,755

1428
01:29:57,092 --> 01:30:03,790
HoW do I say that for the first time

that she is my friend...my doctor...

1437
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:50,462
Who's fighting day and night just to

1438
01:30:56,549 --> 01:30:57,687
I'm dying Mom...

01:31:01,765 --> 01:31:02,736
That's not true...

1440
01:31:05,937 --> 01:31:07,252
That's not true...

1441
01:31:09,588 --> 01:31:12,468
Priya said a transpIant is possibIe

01:31:49,366 --> 01:31:51,476
I WiII hide my tears and pain...

1448
01:31:54,303 --> 01:31:56,176
but WiII you be abIe
to hide your Iove?

1449
01:32:00,040 --> 01:32:03,478
It's not my Iove anymore.
It's someone eIse's

1450
01:32:05,047 --> 01:32:06,884
I just have to reach it
to the right destination

1451
01:32:08,002 --> 01:32:09,069
That's my onIy dream noW

TeII me the truth

1456
01:32:55,325 --> 01:32:56,854

AhI Aman, you knoW...

01:33:05,478 --> 01:33:07,279
I have tried so many times...
Is it Doctor's speciaI?

1460
01:33:07,564 --> 01:33:08,500
Aman, be serious.
- Okay, I'm serious.

1461
01:33:08,747 --> 01:33:10,619
What did you teII Naina?
- What's to teII Naina?

1462
01:33:10,867 --> 01:33:13,748
ActuaIIy Naina has a mentaI probIem

1463
01:33:14,171 --> 01:33:16,874
She thinks Whoever she Ioves
Ieaves her and goes aWay

1464
01:33:17,474 --> 01:33:20,011
If I Ieave her too
she WiII go insane

01:33:20,255 --> 01:33:21,049
She's haIf Way there anyway

1466

And anyway, you knoW

1467
01:33:24,254 --> 01:33:25,392
I'm so sexy, baby.

1468
01:33:25,645 --> 01:33:27,696
Except me... of course

1469
01:33:27,940 --> 01:33:28,626
Yes... That's because
you are taIIer

1470
01:33:28,879 --> 01:33:30,266
It WiII take time but
WiII definiteIy have an effect

1471
01:33:33,851 --> 01:33:35,724
You reaIIy Iove her, don't you?
- I do.

1472
01:33:37,015 --> 01:33:38,023
I can't beIieve it.

1473
01:33:39,692 --> 01:33:42,229
I have knoWn you for so many years
but I have never seen you Iike this

1474
01:33:43,830 --> 01:33:44,897
HoW did you manage this?

1475
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,719
It's kind of strange.

1476
01:33:48,976 --> 01:33:50,291
AII my Iife I ran aWay from Iove

1477
01:33:51,062 --> 01:33:54,606
And noW When Iife is running aWay
from me, I have bumped into Iove

1478
01:33:59,407 --> 01:34:03,367
TeII me the truth, Priya...
Do I reaIIy have very IittIe time?

1479
01:34:05,041 --> 01:34:07,672
Can't anything be done?
TeII me the truth, pIease

1480
01:34:09,630 --> 01:34:15,499
Aman... as soon as you get a donor...

1481
01:34:19,609 --> 01:34:20,711
Aman, it's reaIIy not funny.

1482
01:34:21,000 --> 01:34:23,703
It's reaIIy not funny.
- Give me a hug.

1483
01:34:23,955 --> 01:34:24,571
No.- Come on.

1484
01:34:24,824 --> 01:34:25,405

Long hug from a Iong Iady. Come on.
PIease, give me a hug.

1486
01:34:31,223 --> 01:34:31,874
Is it having any effect?

1487
01:34:39,324 --> 01:34:40,746
While it was a season
of heartbeats at one end...

1488
01:34:42,661 --> 01:34:44,214
it was a season of heartbreaks at the other

1489
01:34:45,340 --> 01:34:47,699
One was my heart... the other was Gia's

1490
01:34:48,329 --> 01:34:49,953
whose Aman had turned out to be married

1491
01:34:50,520 --> 01:34:51,907
l love you, Aman.

1492
01:34:57,648 --> 01:35:01,050
And poor Rohit... Even Laila
had found someone

1493
01:35:03,628 --> 01:35:08,797
But the greatest heartbreak was...

1494
01:35:12,808 --> 01:35:14,716
He doesn't Iove me, Naina.

1495
01:35:15,034 --> 01:35:16,171
SWeetu, don't cry. ReIax.

1496
01:35:16,424 --> 01:35:17,147
Everything WiII be aII right

1497
01:35:17,398 --> 01:35:23,029
He doesn't Iove me...He says he's confused

1498
01:35:23,309 --> 01:35:23,818
SiIIy boy.

1499
01:35:24,490 --> 01:35:25,249
I don't bIame him.

1500
01:35:25,533 --> 01:35:26,707
HoW rude is that.

1501
01:35:27,307 --> 01:35:30,674
He Wants to Ieave for London...
to join some bhangra group

1502
01:35:31,237 --> 01:35:31,817
Bhangra group?

1503
01:35:32,106 --> 01:35:34,049
Yes... and do you knoW
the name of the group?

1504
01:35:34,296 --> 01:35:37,769
'Forget DaIer... Watch us'
What kind of a name is that?

1505
01:35:41,250 --> 01:35:44,202
Tissue...thank you.

1506
01:35:44,658 --> 01:35:46,673
And while we youngsters
were nursing our heartaches...

1507
01:35:48,448 --> 01:35:50,000
the elders were finding their mates

1508
01:35:52,446 --> 01:35:53,062
Can you believe it?

1509
01:35:53,629 --> 01:35:57,589
Those stupid red roses
were back in my house

1510
01:35:57,836 --> 01:35:58,630
Enough is enough.

1511
01:35:59,435 --> 01:36:02,695
And if red roses were in the house...
the red dress was out!

1512
01:36:03,608 --> 01:36:06,488
Hi, I'd Iike to return this
sorry, not my coIor.

1513
01:36:07,884 --> 01:36:09,022
Not mine either.

1514
01:36:11,640 --> 01:36:13,193
So... you didn't Iike it?

1515
01:36:13,448 --> 01:36:15,807
No, And you?- No

1516
01:36:17,655 --> 01:36:19,670
Nice dress. - Nice tie.

1517
01:36:20,123 --> 01:36:22,174
Oh... What happened With Aman?

1518

1687

''I WiII be happy... I WiII Iove again...

He harasses me, he makes fun of me

Wherever I go, he foIIoWs me

1692
01:46:16,820 --> 01:46:18,242
And he eavesdrops on
everyone's conversations

1693
01:46:18,663 --> 01:46:21,473
But, I stiII Iove him.

1694
01:46:24,678 --> 01:46:26,859
Why do I Iove him?

1695
01:46:27,773 --> 01:46:31,899
Why is this happening to me?
What shouId I do?

Rohit Ioves Naina...
Naina doesn't Iove Rohit

1764
01:51:45,019 --> 01:51:46,227
She Ioves Aman

1765
01:51:46,480 --> 01:51:49,111
But Aman teIIs Rohit that he
shouIdn't Iet go of Naina so easiIy

1766
01:51:49,365 --> 01:51:51,961
So basicaIIy Aman is... insaneI

Who are you taIking to?
I haven't gone insane

01:51:54,581 --> 01:51:55,754
Your brains have been dispIaced

1769
01:51:56,215 --> 01:51:57,388
Naina hasn't faIIen in Iove With me

1770
01:51:57,814 --> 01:52:00,138
She just thinks that she has
faIIen in Iove With me.

1771
01:52:00,387 --> 01:52:02,046
She thinks... Ah... she thinksI

1772
01:52:02,300 --> 01:52:03,616
NoW What is 'she thinks'
supposed to mean?

1773
01:52:04,213 --> 01:52:06,500
Man... I am a neW entry
into her Iife

1774
01:52:06,751 --> 01:52:07,687
I just Iaughed a IittIe With her,

1775
01:52:07,933 --> 01:52:08,584
and she thought she is in Iove With me

1776
01:52:09,289 --> 01:52:10,746
WhiIe you have knoWn her for years...

1777
01:52:10,992 --> 01:52:12,201
she takes you for granted...

1778
01:52:12,766 --> 01:52:14,497
noW she is not going to dream
that you are in Iove With her

1779
01:52:14,887 --> 01:52:18,431
NoW just forget aII this friendship

1785
01:52:33,454 --> 01:52:34,106
NainaI

1786
01:52:35,088 --> 01:52:36,617
Naina's beautifuI eyesI

1787
01:52:37,557 --> 01:52:38,695
Naina's IoveIy face

1788
01:52:39,679 --> 01:52:40,887
Naina's fury...

1789
01:52:41,138 --> 01:52:41,897
Naina's Iove...

1790
01:52:42,460 --> 01:52:43,562
Naina's smiIe...

1791
01:52:43,816 --> 01:52:45,131
Whenever she does, that is

1792
01:52:45,729 --> 01:52:47,388
Naina's hair... When she
ties them up Iike this

1793
01:52:47,675 --> 01:52:49,726
ActuaIIy I Iike her hair aII Iet doWn

1794
01:52:56,785 --> 01:52:58,208
Why are you saying, Naina?

1795
01:52:59,428 --> 01:53:01,159
For you... I'm marriedI

1796
01:53:02,697 --> 01:53:03,799
And What if you Weren't?

1797
01:53:04,574 --> 01:53:06,790
Then I WouIdn't Iet go of her.
I'm not an idiot Iike you

1798
01:53:07,216 --> 01:53:09,848
I am taIking about Naina.

1799
01:53:10,416 --> 01:53:13,853
You are rightI NoW What do I do?
- You don't do anything

1800
01:53:14,101 --> 01:53:15,168
NoW Whatever has to be done,
I WiII do

1801
01:53:15,491 --> 01:53:17,851
You just do as I say
I have a pIan...

1802
01:53:18,552 --> 01:53:21,990
six days and girI in your face...
Just six days.

1803
01:53:22,516 --> 01:53:24,626
WoWI But Why six days?

1804
01:53:25,540 --> 01:53:27,448
Because I don't Work on Sundays

1805
01:53:34,685 --> 01:53:35,171
DAY ONE

1806
01:53:37,467 --> 01:53:39,268
Naina Waits for me everyday here at 6 p.m.

1807
01:53:40,179 --> 01:53:41,637
We go together from here to the cIass

1808
01:53:44,386 --> 01:53:46,152
But you Won't go With her today
- Why?

1809
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:47,887
Because I say so

1810
01:53:48,524 --> 01:53:50,812
Is your pIan to bring us together
or throW us apart?

1811
01:53:51,479 --> 01:53:52,795
I have a theory about girIs

1812
01:53:53,357 --> 01:53:55,894
The more you run after them,
the more they WiII run aWay from you

1813
01:53:56,139 --> 01:53:59,054
But if you run aWay from them they WiII
be confused and WiII run after you...

1814
01:53:59,338 --> 01:54:00,890
to find out the reason for their confusion

1815
01:54:01,216 --> 01:54:03,361
And We have to take advantage of such
a confusion of a confused girI...

1816
01:54:03,962 --> 01:54:05,136
Even I'm confusedI

1817
01:54:05,561 --> 01:54:07,292
That you are... from chiIdhoodI
That can't be heIped...

1818
01:54:07,543 --> 01:54:09,523
but trust me... do as I say

1819
01:54:10,082 --> 01:54:10,876
Put this into your ear

1820
01:54:12,620 --> 01:54:14,078
Put it Where?- In your ear

1821
01:54:17,523 --> 01:54:19,325
This device WiII be attached
to the phone...

1822
01:54:19,992 --> 01:54:21,580
so that I can speak to you constantIy

1823
01:54:21,834 --> 01:54:24,430
Whatever I say or do... you shouId do
Got it?

1824
01:54:28,058 --> 01:54:31,840
Rohit come in pIease.
- AIfa Bravo CharIie, I read you.

1825
01:54:32,127 --> 01:54:33,928
I have reached the coIIege

1826
01:54:34,282 --> 01:54:37,340
Good SoIdier, NoW reIax at ease...

1827
01:54:37,829 --> 01:54:38,516
Loosen your tie

1828
01:54:39,254 --> 01:54:40,463
For God's sake, change your WaIk

1829
01:54:40,993 --> 01:54:44,359
WaIk?- Yes, your WaIking styIe.
I mean cooI WaIk, you knoW?

1830
01:54:53,892 --> 01:54:54,722
Have you reached the cIassroom.
- Yes

1831
01:54:55,840 --> 01:54:58,614
So stop shaking, idiotI
Can you see Naina?

1832
01:55:00,012 --> 01:55:01,921
Yes...- Shut your mouth, duffer

1833
01:55:02,237 --> 01:55:04,039
Go and sit next to her
but don't speak to her

1834
01:55:05,054 --> 01:55:07,105
Where Were you? I Was Waiting
for you for over haIf hour

1835
01:55:07,349 --> 01:55:10,407
You are aIWays Iate.
I just don't understand this.

1836
01:55:12,147 --> 01:55:14,399
Don't Iook at her... Don't...
Look up... Iook doWn...

1837
01:55:14,755 --> 01:55:18,051
Look to the side... Not her side,

For the past three days, I have been
trying...Where Were you, Rohit?

1900
01:58:35,103 --> 01:58:36,596
When I needed a friend,
Where Were you?

1901
01:58:36,841 --> 01:58:39,271
I'm tired... I'm reaIIy
tired of being your friend

1902
01:58:39,796 --> 01:58:40,767
What?- What? What?

1903
01:58:41,013 --> 01:58:41,807
When you Want to Iaugh, it's Rohit...

1904
01:58:42,056 --> 01:58:42,507
When you Want to cry, it's Rohit

1905
01:58:42,752 --> 01:58:43,926
But When you have to Iove,
it's someone eIseI

1906
01:58:44,178 --> 01:58:45,802
It's not going to Work anymore, right?

01:58:50,331 --> 01:58:52,619
So a very inteIIigent man has said that

1910
01:58:52,870 --> 01:58:54,257
the first step to Iove is friendship...

1911
01:58:54,852 --> 01:58:55,646

1918
01:59:26,598 --> 01:59:28,364
That day l felt Rohit had
ceased to be my friend...

1919
01:59:28,858 --> 01:59:29,758
he had become something else

1920
01:59:30,874 --> 01:59:34,762

02:10:13,990 --> 02:10:17,048
Listen to me...ya...
- No, Iisten to me.

2040
02:10:17,293 --> 02:10:19,759
I thought of you as a friend
and poured my heart out to you

2041
02:10:20,179 --> 02:10:22,715
And What did you do?
ToId him everythingI

2042
02:10:23,134 --> 02:10:25,837
And he... He, Who Wants
to pIay God to everyone...

2043
02:10:26,089 --> 02:10:30,358
decided that since he couIdn't
Iove me, he WouId find Iove for me...

2044
02:10:31,653 --> 02:10:33,312
and he knocked on your door

2045
02:10:33,565 --> 02:10:36,268
And toId you that your friendship is
not just friendship, it's Iove

2046
02:10:36,521 --> 02:10:37,315
And you got convinced?

2047
02:10:37,912 --> 02:10:39,050
Rohit, What kind of a person are you...?

2048
02:10:39,303 --> 02:10:42,183

2049
02:10:42,432 --> 02:10:44,269
I Iove you Naina...

2050
02:10:44,553 --> 02:10:46,698
NoI That's not the truth...

2051
02:10:46,987 --> 02:10:50,698
The truth is that you have broken
my heartI You have hurt me...

2052
02:10:52,203 --> 02:10:55,427
I knoW that I didn't have
Iaughter in my Iife before..

2053
02:10:55,680 --> 02:10:57,932
didn't have happiness...
But at Ieast I had a friendI

2054
02:10:58,809 --> 02:11:00,991
But today you have
taken that aWay from me...

2055
02:11:01,765 --> 02:11:02,559
Both of you

2056
02:11:03,677 --> 02:11:06,735

2072
02:12:18,433 --> 02:12:19,748
A Iot of peopIe have Ioved before...

2073
02:12:20,693 --> 02:12:23,397
but my Iove stands apart
from aII of them because...

2074
02:12:24,101 --> 02:12:24,895

2075
02:12:29,177 --> 02:12:30,457
I can never forget you Naina

2076
02:12:31,263 --> 02:12:34,322

02:12:52,474 --> 02:12:58,306
AII this is Written in this diary...

2080
02:12:59,080 --> 02:13:00,218
HoW can he hurt... ?

02:13:02,210 --> 02:13:04,391
And you have such
a bad handWriting

2082
02:13:34,511 --> 02:13:36,692
Aman... aII this... I didn't...

2083
02:13:36,945 --> 02:13:38,438
You didn't Write...
but I said it

2084
02:13:39,066 --> 02:13:41,602
If you had to Write it,
you WouId Write the same thing

2085
02:13:41,848 --> 02:13:44,800
So I said What Was in your heart...
What's the big deaI? Right?

2086
02:13:45,151 --> 02:13:48,862
And girIs Iike aII this...

2087
02:13:49,845 --> 02:13:50,295
Are you okay?

2088
02:13:51,931 --> 02:13:55,049
I just Want to make a caII.

2089
02:14:22,564 --> 02:14:24,579
Sorry Mom It's Iate, Iet's go

2090
02:14:27,258 --> 02:14:29,724
I Want to say something
to you... just Iisten

2091
02:14:31,013 --> 02:14:38,755
Naina, to sustain IifeIong...

2092
02:14:39,880 --> 02:14:43,282
every reIationship has to
have strength aIong With Iove

2093
02:14:45,965 --> 02:14:51,169
Your Papa Ioved us a Iot,
but he Was a Weak man

2094
02:14:53,475 --> 02:14:54,648
He Ieft us aII and Went aWay...

2095
02:14:56,604 --> 02:15:01,501
didn't even for a moment think
What WouId become of us after him

2096
02:15:04,775 --> 02:15:09,292
But Rohit... Rohit is not Weak...

2097
02:15:10,165 --> 02:15:11,931
he Ioves you a Iot

2098
02:15:14,511 --> 02:15:17,048
HoW easy it is for you
to say Papa Was WeakI

2099
02:15:18,858 --> 02:15:23,481
And Rohit... taking someone
eIse's heIp to attain your Iove...

2100
02:15:23,761 --> 02:15:26,819
isn't that a sign of Weakness?
TeII me Mama...

2101
02:15:30,366 --> 02:15:32,025
To attain his Iove
he sought heIp...

2102
02:15:32,975 --> 02:15:34,113
What's Wrong With that?

2103
02:15:36,625 --> 02:15:42,814
Look, I stiII maintain Rohit
is not a Weak man

2104
02:15:45,144 --> 02:15:50,289
He knoWs you Iove someone eIse
and yet he is WiIIing to accept you

2105
02:15:52,272 --> 02:15:56,196
That's strength, my chiId.
That's Iove.

2106
02:15:59,956 --> 02:16:05,587
If you reject his Iove today,
it WiII be a girI's decision...

2107
02:16:09,866 --> 02:16:15,355
and tomorroW When you repent it,
it WiII be a Woman's regretI

2108
02:16:27,077 --> 02:16:27,693
HeIIo.

So everything is fixedI

2166
02:22:27,961 --> 02:22:31,707
Engagement and our Wedding
anniversary WiII be on the same day

2167

As you Wish.

2170
02:22:39,435 --> 02:22:40,988
And the funny thing, Jamnaben is...

02:22:41,521 --> 02:22:43,702
You knoW. It's Jennifer
- Yes... Jenniferben...

2172
02:22:43,955 --> 02:22:46,315

from Paris...

02:22:53,969 --> 02:22:55,806

NoW Iook PateIji... I Ieave aII

2177
02:23:02,696 --> 02:23:06,335
I am just happy that We got
such a good boy

2178
02:23:08,434 --> 02:23:13,578
I just miss my sonI
- Very sad.

2179
02:23:14,170 --> 02:23:15,035
Rohit toId us...

2180
02:23:16,605 --> 02:23:18,264
What happened?- Heart attackI

2181
02:23:19,560 --> 02:23:22,618
Oh, heart attack.

2182
02:23:22,863 --> 02:23:24,522
Just Waiting for Naina
and Shiv to settIe doWn...

2183
02:23:24,949 --> 02:23:26,787
then I can peacefuIIy
Ieave for ChandigarhI

2184
02:23:27,036 --> 02:23:28,043
And What about Gia?

2185
02:23:28,287 --> 02:23:29,390
She is not oursI- Dadi.

2186
02:23:30,512 --> 02:23:34,578
No, no, Gia is as much ours
as Naina is

2187
02:23:37,189 --> 02:23:42,915
And my husband didn't die
of a heart attack...

2188
02:23:44,316 --> 02:23:45,561
he commited suicide

2189
02:24:03,162 --> 02:24:04,750
Why did you have to
teII them the truth?

2190
02:24:05,665 --> 02:24:07,740
You cannot base neW
reIationships on a Iie

2191
02:24:08,030 --> 02:24:09,381
You couIdn't handIe
oId reIationships

2192
02:24:09,629 --> 02:24:10,909
HoW WiII you knoW
hoW to handIe neW ones?

2193
02:24:11,159 --> 02:24:13,139
ReIationships are not handIed.
They are maintained

2194
02:24:13,385 --> 02:24:14,558
But What WouId you knoW about them?

2195
02:24:14,811 --> 02:24:15,462
NoW Iisten my dear daughter-in-IaW...

2196
02:24:16,479 --> 02:24:19,846
I WiII onIy be your daughter-in-IaW
the day Gia is your grand daughter

2197
02:24:20,095 --> 02:24:22,798
Gia Was not my grand daughter
and she WiII never beI

2198
02:24:23,051 --> 02:24:23,916
BIood is bIood after aIII

2199
02:24:24,163 --> 02:24:26,973
That's itI I don't Want to hear anymoreI

2200
02:24:27,224 --> 02:24:29,548
Why? When you are so fond
of saying the truth...

2201
02:24:29,797 --> 02:24:33,827
Iearn to Iisten to it too.
Gia is not my grand daughter

2202
02:24:34,942 --> 02:24:38,760
She is not a part of this famiIy
She is just a burden...

2203
02:24:39,045 --> 02:24:43,206
a burden Which you thrust
on this famiIy by adopting her

2204
02:24:44,365 --> 02:24:48,466
A burden Which took aWay
aII the happiness in the famiIy...

2205
02:24:48,746 --> 02:24:52,005
took aWay peace...took aWay my son...

2206
02:24:54,553 --> 02:24:58,026
I hate her... I hate her...
I hate that nasty IittIe...

2207
02:24:58,273 --> 02:24:58,889
NOI

2208
02:25:11,208 --> 02:25:13,946
We are stiII paying
for my son's mistakes

2209
02:25:14,233 --> 02:25:15,856
The first mistake he made
Was marrying you

2210
02:25:16,145 --> 02:25:17,532
The second Was adopting that girI

2211
02:25:17,780 --> 02:25:18,989
He made a third one too

2212
02:25:19,274 --> 02:25:22,855
You? Who the heII are you to
interfere in our famiIy matters?

2213
02:25:23,134 --> 02:25:28,208
No one... Just a voice that shouId
have reached you a Iong time ago

2214
02:25:29,358 --> 02:25:32,417
A truth that you shouId
have reaIized Iong ago

2215
02:25:33,113 --> 02:25:35,649
PIease Jenny, pIease Iet me

2216
02:25:37,564 --> 02:25:40,029
Since you are harping on the truth,
I WouId Iike to teII you a truth too

2217
02:25:40,867 --> 02:25:44,506
About your son's
iIIicit reIationship...

2218
02:25:46,709 --> 02:25:48,511
Which he hid from aII of you

2219
02:25:49,246 --> 02:25:51,048
But he couIdn't hide its resuIt

2220
02:25:51,820 --> 02:25:53,207
Do you knoW the name of the resuIt?

2221
02:25:53,524 --> 02:25:56,298
Aman pIease.- Jenny, it's aIright.

2222
02:25:58,740 --> 02:26:00,162
The resuIt Was Gia...

2223
02:26:02,842 --> 02:26:03,293
GiaI

2224
02:26:04,128 --> 02:26:05,895
Who couId not be accepted
by her oWn mother...

2225
02:26:06,354 --> 02:26:09,306
but Was accepted by
your daughter-in-IaW, Jenny...

2226
02:26:11,430 --> 02:26:14,453
Was brought into this house
by your daughter-in-IaW, Jenny...

2227
02:26:15,638 --> 02:26:18,827
Jenny... Who couId have seen the face
of the other Woman in Gia's face...

2228
02:26:20,053 --> 02:26:22,590
Who couId have seen her husband's
mistakes in that face...

2229
02:26:23,531 --> 02:26:26,067
But What she chose
to see Were those incompIete eyes...

2230
02:26:28,260 --> 02:26:30,132
and she chose to compIete those
eyes by fiIIing them With Iove...

2231
02:26:31,667 --> 02:26:32,770
your daughter-in-IaW Jenny

2232
02:26:44,915 --> 02:26:47,760
Your son WouId have understood
her hurt and her anger...

2233
02:26:48,878 --> 02:26:50,573
but he couIdn't understand
her acceptance

2234
02:26:51,382 --> 02:26:55,021
Jenny's strength reminded him
every minute of his oWn Weakness...

2235
02:26:56,806 --> 02:27:01,287
and it Was this feeIing that
took his Iife... Not Jenny

2236
02:27:08,106 --> 02:27:09,078
Dear Jennifer

2237
02:27:10,123 --> 02:27:14,391
l know in these last six years
l have only enquired about Gia...

2238
02:27:15,200 --> 02:27:16,728
never about you

2239
02:27:17,738 --> 02:27:24,093
But today, in this last letter
l want to thank you..

2240
02:27:25,457 --> 02:27:28,029
Thank y ou Jennifer. Thank y ou

2241
02:27:28,760 --> 02:27:32,542
Women are built to forgive the
mistakes that their husbands make...

2242
02:27:33,593 --> 02:27:38,833
but very few women have the courage
to accept the mistake...

2243
02:27:39,574 --> 02:27:43,249
and shower love to such a degree
that it doesn't remain a mistake

2244
02:27:44,129 --> 02:27:49,819
y ou accepted Gia when l, her mother,
couldn't accept her

2245
02:27:50,492 --> 02:27:52,779
And for this l will always
remain indebted to you

2246
02:27:53,865 --> 02:27:56,010
They say that when
a man makes a mistake...

2247
02:27:56,542 --> 02:27:59,351
he also possesses the ability
to pay the price for it

2248
02:28:00,019 --> 02:28:05,472
But Jennifer, all these years you have
paid a price for a mistake...

2249
02:28:06,069 --> 02:28:07,348
that was not yours
in the first place

2250
02:28:08,468 --> 02:28:09,784
And all that because of me

2251
02:28:11,146 --> 02:28:12,769
lf you can, please forgive me

2252
02:28:14,275 --> 02:28:15,555
l'm sorry Jennifer.

2253
02:28:16,153 --> 02:28:17,183
l'm really sorry

2254
02:28:18,273 --> 02:28:21,640
l caused you a lot of pain!
l'm sorry.

2255
02:28:35,624 --> 02:28:37,011
He Was a good manI

2256
02:28:39,136 --> 02:28:46,676
It Was just a mistakeI
Just a mistakeI

2257
02:28:46,959 --> 02:28:48,417
Yes, my chiId... Yes...

2258
02:28:50,332 --> 02:28:57,493
He Was a good manI
He Was a good man, Mother...

2259
02:29:00,971 --> 02:29:07,954
He Was a good man NainaI
Just a mistakeI

2260
02:29:12,550 --> 02:29:17,066
And finally Gia's perfect family
was complete... complete

2261
02:29:19,261 --> 02:29:20,754
All the distances were bridged...

2262
02:29:21,695 --> 02:29:24,683
and we started praying together...

2263
02:29:26,041 --> 02:29:27,665
like one big happy family!

2264
02:29:28,475 --> 02:29:31,046
The engagement preparations
had begun in full swing!

2265
02:29:32,439 --> 02:29:35,947
Jean De Bon... the famous decorator
from France had arrived...

2266
02:29:36,368 --> 02:29:38,834
to do up the Patel Mansion!

2267
02:29:39,775 --> 02:29:40,534
Drapes.

2268
02:29:42,071 --> 02:29:42,686
From the top.

2269
02:29:43,044 --> 02:29:52,529
Leaving aII the Iove of my famiIy
I have to go to my beIoved's Iand...

2270
02:29:52,814 --> 02:29:53,265
ExceIIentI

2271
02:29:53,509 --> 02:29:56,912
And in Aman's mansion
there was chaos!

2272
02:29:57,543 --> 02:29:58,966
Oh God! -Oh godI

2273
02:29:59,212 --> 02:30:04,523
God had heard Kantaben's prayers.
Rohit was getting married to a girl

2274
02:30:07,939 --> 02:30:09,219
Finally, the day of the engagement...

2275
02:30:12,946 --> 02:30:18,186
Gujarat opened its opulent doors for
Punjab in its characteristic splendour

2276
02:30:31,514 --> 02:30:34,608
''One, tWo, three...
What a communityI''

2277
02:30:34,921 --> 02:30:38,217
''The Shahs, the PateIs, the Mehtas..
they have the best jeWeIIery''

2278
02:30:38,537 --> 02:30:41,833
''But Who are We...?
- Yes, Who are We?''

2279
02:30:43,683 --> 02:30:46,706
''G-U-J-J-U''

2280
02:30:48,308 --> 02:30:50,145
''G-U-J-J-U''

2281
02:30:51,611 --> 02:30:53,105
''G...'' ''Gathiya''

2282
02:30:53,349 --> 02:30:54,736
''U...'' ''Undiyo''

2283
02:30:54,984 --> 02:30:56,407
''J...'' ''JamWa (eat)''

2284
02:30:56,688 --> 02:30:58,312
''J...- Jamnagar, of course''

2285
02:30:58,565 --> 02:31:03,533
''U...'' ''G-U-J-J-U''

2286
02:31:05,206 --> 02:31:06,972
''G-U-J-J-U''

2287
02:31:08,405 --> 02:31:11,357
''Gujju, Gujju...'' ''Rohit and Naina...''

2288
02:31:11,604 --> 02:31:14,793
''We are proud of you''
''GujjuI''

2289
02:31:19,845 --> 02:31:20,355
It's okay.

2290
02:31:21,271 --> 02:31:23,867
ShouId We caII KunWari Kudi again?

Don't do that...okay? Enough

2427

Doing that doesn't

2428
02:46:00,930 --> 02:46:03,324
Naina Ioves you, you Iove Naina...

2429
02:46:03,642 --> 02:46:04,994
hoW have I become a part
of this Iove story?

02:46:05,276 --> 02:46:07,291
Love stories are made
With tWo hearts, Rohit...

2431
02:46:09,205 --> 02:46:11,836
and in a feW months my heart
Won't exist in the Iove story...

2432
02:46:13,273 --> 02:46:14,766
I WiII just be a memory

2433
02:46:15,429 --> 02:46:16,365
You are the reaIity, Rohit

2434
02:46:16,611 --> 02:46:18,483

2435
02:46:19,219 --> 02:46:20,677
But I don't have the strength
to fight a memory, Aman

2436
02:46:20,923 --> 02:46:23,732
You don't have the strength?
HoW can you say that?

2437
02:46:24,887 --> 02:46:27,874
It means you don't Iove Naina
as much as I thought you do

2438
02:46:28,467 --> 02:46:29,712
Say you don't knoW hoW to Iove

And you WiII Iet go

Naina WiII get me

02:46:45,435 --> 02:46:46,609
but Iosing you she WiII gain nothing

2446
02:46:47,592 --> 02:46:49,144
Neither Iove nor a great friendshipI

2447
02:46:49,678 --> 02:46:53,744
Her Iove is yours. It beIongs to you

2448
02:46:55,033 --> 02:47:01,388
It just needs time. And that's
What I don't have... I don't have

2449
02:47:02,231 --> 02:47:05,040
Naina beIongs to you.
You cannot Ieave her

2450
02:47:05,290 --> 02:47:06,819
If not for you, if not for Naina...

You can't Ieave Naina.
That's itI That's itI

2454
02:47:16,660 --> 02:47:18,356
What WouId you have done
if you Were in my pIace?

2455
02:47:22,883 --> 02:47:29,760
