2
00:01:34,508 --> 00:01:35,497
Morning, professor.

3
00:01:35,575 --> 00:01:36,940
Good morning.

4
00:02:27,461 --> 00:02:29,725
What do we have
on the board today?

5
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:32,161
Dr. Cross will be wanting
to pick up

6
00:02:32,232 --> 00:02:36,134
those three 629 Pullmans.

7
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:39,864
And 630 Observation.

8
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,703
Shouldn't be a problem.

9
00:03:02,195 --> 00:03:04,356
What number?

10
00:03:04,998 --> 00:03:07,330
Um, 423.

11
00:03:10,604 --> 00:03:13,038
I'll have your train
in two weeks.

12
00:03:13,106 --> 00:03:14,971
Uh, okay.

13
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:18,767
Hi.

14
00:03:19,412 --> 00:03:20,936
Hey.

15
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,713
You forget something?

16
00:03:24,818 --> 00:03:26,183
No.

17
00:03:29,155 --> 00:03:30,349
Hike!

18
00:03:30,423 --> 00:03:31,856
Hike!

19
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:34,217
All right.
Nice throw.

20
00:03:34,294 --> 00:03:35,454
Nice throw.

21
00:03:35,529 --> 00:03:37,190
[Laughing]

22
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,366
Hey, buddy, where's Snow White?

23
00:03:42,702 --> 00:03:44,897
Grumpy or Sleepy
over there, huh?

24
00:03:44,971 --> 00:03:46,336
[Laughs]

25
00:03:52,679 --> 00:03:54,670
MAN:
Lorraine, look.

26
00:03:54,748 --> 00:03:57,512
He's gonna hear you.
Stop.

27
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:59,084
[Chuckles]

28
00:04:05,892 --> 00:04:07,257
Miss.

29
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:10,128
Paper or plastic?

30
00:04:11,131 --> 00:04:13,759
- Paper.
- Sorry.

31
00:04:14,301 --> 00:04:16,030
I didn't see you.

32
00:04:16,503 --> 00:04:18,869
- Cash or charge?
- Cash.

33
00:04:24,344 --> 00:04:27,211
Who's showing the movie tonight?

34
00:04:29,516 --> 00:04:30,983
Carl.

35
00:04:35,722 --> 00:04:39,180
CARL: The billowing smoke
as it's coming forward.

36
00:04:39,292 --> 00:04:42,455
My wife was inside the car,
staying warm,

37
00:04:42,529 --> 00:04:45,464
but I was on the hood.

38
00:04:45,532 --> 00:04:50,231
There's people standing by here
as it's going by.

39
00:04:50,303 --> 00:04:52,794
The traffic, of course,

40
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:57,332
was stopped
to allow the train...

41
00:04:57,844 --> 00:04:58,606
Oh.

42
00:04:58,678 --> 00:05:01,146
Now, here I was hanging out
shooting this

43
00:05:01,247 --> 00:05:03,613
in Canada.

44
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,242
This is Canada.
It's cold.

45
00:05:06,353 --> 00:05:08,116
Snow.

46
00:05:08,188 --> 00:05:15,253
The scenery was,
uh, really spectacular.

47
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:17,592
See, because the train
is moving forward,

48
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:19,131
the smoke is coming back.

49
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:24,831
It was not extremely windy,
but the smoke did billow.

50
00:05:24,904 --> 00:05:28,067
And, oh, we're about to go
into a tunnel.

51
00:05:28,141 --> 00:05:30,234
Yeah, we're in a tunnel.

52
00:05:30,310 --> 00:05:32,540
For about a minute.

53
00:05:32,612 --> 00:05:36,446
It got colder
when we were in the tunnel.

54
00:05:36,549 --> 00:05:41,577
It was one of the darker tunnels
in Canada.

55
00:06:01,508 --> 00:06:03,135
Lunch.

56
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:09,048
[Thud]

57
00:06:29,269 --> 00:06:32,830
He was a nice man.
He was a nice man.

58
00:06:32,906 --> 00:06:34,806
I don't think we've ever met.

59
00:06:34,874 --> 00:06:36,307
No, but I've seen you around.

60
00:06:36,376 --> 00:06:40,676
Well, like, you're one of
those memorable people.

61
00:06:41,981 --> 00:06:44,973
I brought you down here
to discuss your inheritance.

62
00:06:45,051 --> 00:06:47,019
In his will,
Henry bequeathed to you

63
00:06:47,087 --> 00:06:50,614
some property
in Newfoundland, New Jersey.

64
00:06:50,724 --> 00:06:52,624
It's about half an acre of land.

65
00:06:52,692 --> 00:06:54,182
It's got an old train depot
on it.

66
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:57,957
I have an appraisal of
the property for your records.

67
00:06:59,966 --> 00:07:02,628
- What's happening with the shop?
- The building's been sold.

68
00:07:02,702 --> 00:07:06,160
Golden Spike will be closed,
and the inventory liquidated.

69
00:07:06,239 --> 00:07:07,672
This is all, of course,

70
00:07:07,741 --> 00:07:10,369
in accordance with the terms
I drew up in Henry's will.

71
00:07:10,443 --> 00:07:12,138
How soon?

72
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,871
If everything goes as planned,
no hitches, anything,

73
00:07:15,949 --> 00:07:18,713
a thing like this
takes about six weeks.

74
00:07:18,818 --> 00:07:21,286
I have some preliminary
paperwork for you to sign.

75
00:07:21,387 --> 00:07:22,854
Some other papers
being drawn up.

76
00:07:22,922 --> 00:07:24,856
We have the keys to the depot.

77
00:07:24,924 --> 00:07:26,585
You ever been out to New Jersey?

78
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:27,717
No.

79
00:07:27,794 --> 00:07:30,490
I drove through it once.
Let me tell you.

80
00:07:30,563 --> 00:07:34,226
I mean, it's pretty,
but there's nothing out there.

81
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,165
Nothing.

82
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,114
[Thunder crashes]

83
00:09:53,306 --> 00:09:55,536
[Switch clicking]

84
00:10:20,066 --> 00:10:23,263
[Rustling]

85
00:10:36,683 --> 00:10:38,446
JOE:
Then where'd you go?

86
00:10:38,551 --> 00:10:40,416
I see.

87
00:10:41,054 --> 00:10:42,282
Good.

88
00:10:42,355 --> 00:10:44,084
So, what else, dude?

89
00:10:45,191 --> 00:10:46,351
Yeah?

90
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:48,360
Andy, why don't you
come out here, bro?

91
00:10:48,428 --> 00:10:50,658
I'm going out of my mind.

92
00:10:51,798 --> 00:10:53,356
Holy shit.

93
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,962
Hey, let me call you back.

94
00:10:55,034 --> 00:10:56,160
Bye.

95
00:10:58,104 --> 00:10:59,594
Wow.

96
00:10:59,672 --> 00:11:01,230
How you doing?

97
00:11:01,307 --> 00:11:02,239
Fine.

98
00:11:02,308 --> 00:11:03,935
Do you sell coffee?

99
00:11:04,477 --> 00:11:06,945
Cafe con leche.
It's the house special.

100
00:11:07,013 --> 00:11:08,776
- You'll love it. Trust me.
- Okay.

101
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,872
I also got hot dogs and muffins.

102
00:11:10,984 --> 00:11:12,952
You live around here?

103
00:11:13,019 --> 00:11:15,817
- Yeah.
- I never seen you around.

104
00:11:15,888 --> 00:11:17,185
Where you from?

105
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:19,121
- Hoboken.
- No shit?

106
00:11:19,192 --> 00:11:21,353
I live in Manhattan, dude.

107
00:11:21,427 --> 00:11:23,019
So, why you out here?
Work?

108
00:11:23,096 --> 00:11:25,326
Family?
Just, like...

109
00:11:25,398 --> 00:11:28,299
How much do I owe you
for the coffee?

110
00:11:28,368 --> 00:11:29,733
Oh, shit.
Sorry, man.

111
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:31,326
It's a buck.

112
00:11:33,473 --> 00:11:35,270
Is there a convenience store
nearby?

113
00:11:35,341 --> 00:11:39,004
Yeah. Down the road about
a mile and a half on the right.

114
00:11:39,812 --> 00:11:41,541
This is my pop's truck,
by the way.

115
00:11:41,614 --> 00:11:43,241
He's sick.
That's why I'm out here.

116
00:11:43,349 --> 00:11:45,317
He can't get out of bed.

117
00:11:45,385 --> 00:11:47,512
I'm taking care
of this shit for him.

118
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:49,349
I've been here for six weeks.

119
00:11:49,422 --> 00:11:51,515
It's driving me crazy.

120
00:11:51,591 --> 00:11:52,819
Thanks.

121
00:11:54,293 --> 00:11:56,693
Hey, I'm here every day
from 7:00 to 3:00.

122
00:11:56,763 --> 00:11:59,231
I'm Joe Oramas.
What's your name?

123
00:11:59,298 --> 00:12:00,287
Fin.

124
00:12:00,333 --> 00:12:02,096
Fin?

125
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:03,465
Yeah.

126
00:12:03,536 --> 00:12:05,060
Cool.

127
00:12:05,638 --> 00:12:08,835
Hey, your place around here?

128
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,772
Yeah.

129
00:12:29,629 --> 00:12:31,654
Oh, shit.

130
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:47,410
Oh!

131
00:12:48,948 --> 00:12:50,438
Aah!

132
00:12:51,851 --> 00:12:53,546
Oh, my God.

133
00:12:53,653 --> 00:12:55,621
Oh, my God.

134
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:57,882
Oh, my God.
Just stay there.

135
00:12:57,957 --> 00:12:59,219
Don't move.

136
00:12:59,292 --> 00:13:02,284
Don't try to get up.

137
00:13:03,029 --> 00:13:05,327
Oh, I'm so sorry.

138
00:13:05,398 --> 00:13:06,865
God.

139
00:13:06,933 --> 00:13:09,060
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

140
00:13:09,135 --> 00:13:10,466
- Can you move everything?
- Yeah.

141
00:13:10,536 --> 00:13:12,060
Are you sure?

142
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:13,162
Yes.

143
00:13:13,239 --> 00:13:14,706
I'm fine.

144
00:13:16,042 --> 00:13:17,441
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

145
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,808
I'm okay.
I'm okay.

146
00:13:23,316 --> 00:13:25,910
Can I give you a ride somewhere?

147
00:13:26,018 --> 00:13:27,485
No.

148
00:13:27,553 --> 00:13:29,145
You're sure?

149
00:13:29,455 --> 00:13:30,820
Yes.

150
00:13:31,390 --> 00:13:33,620
I'm sorry.

151
00:13:33,693 --> 00:13:35,957
[Breathing heavily]

152
00:14:01,487 --> 00:14:02,920
Hey.

153
00:14:02,989 --> 00:14:04,456
Yoo-hoo.

154
00:14:16,502 --> 00:14:18,470
- Good afternoon, Olivia.
- Hi.

155
00:14:18,538 --> 00:14:21,268
One cafe con leche,
two sugar, coming up.

156
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:27,873
- How you doing today?
- I'm fine.

157
00:14:27,947 --> 00:14:29,209
Here you go.

158
00:14:29,315 --> 00:14:31,647
Oh, hey, did you hear?

159
00:14:33,319 --> 00:14:35,412
Someone moved into the depot.

160
00:14:35,955 --> 00:14:37,217
Oh, that's great.

161
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:38,780
Yeah.
He's an interesting guy.

162
00:14:38,891 --> 00:14:41,416
Actually, he's a little guy.

163
00:14:46,098 --> 00:14:47,998
Shit.

164
00:14:56,209 --> 00:14:57,141
That it?

165
00:14:57,210 --> 00:15:02,477
Uh, two packs of Drum
and some beef jerky.

166
00:15:02,582 --> 00:15:04,550
Help yourself to the jerky.

167
00:15:13,259 --> 00:15:15,989
Oh, shit.
There he is.

168
00:15:17,630 --> 00:15:19,120
- [Coffee spills]
- Ow!

169
00:15:19,198 --> 00:15:21,666
Oh! Oh!

170
00:15:22,802 --> 00:15:24,633
God! Oh!

171
00:15:27,473 --> 00:15:29,441
Oh, my God.

172
00:15:29,508 --> 00:15:32,705
Oh. Oh. Oh.

173
00:15:35,047 --> 00:15:36,605
Oh, my God.

174
00:15:36,716 --> 00:15:38,479
Oh, my God.
I can't believe this.

175
00:15:38,584 --> 00:15:40,916
I can't.
I am so sorry.

176
00:15:40,987 --> 00:15:42,818
- Here.
- Stay.

177
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:44,523
I saw you.

178
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,150
I tried to put
my cafe con leche down,

179
00:15:47,226 --> 00:15:48,750
and it spilled all over my ass.

180
00:15:48,828 --> 00:15:51,558
It burned me very bad,
so I swerved.

181
00:15:51,631 --> 00:15:55,692
Can I at least give you a ride
back to your train station?

182
00:15:56,102 --> 00:15:59,071
The hot-dog guy
told me where you lived.

183
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,500
No, I'm fine.

184
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,506
You're sure?

185
00:16:02,575 --> 00:16:03,542
Yes.

Yeah?

190
00:16:22,428 --> 00:16:23,895
Did she ask about me?

191
00:16:23,963 --> 00:16:25,590
What'd you tell her?

192
00:16:25,665 --> 00:16:27,496
Don't fucking tell her that.

193
00:16:27,566 --> 00:16:29,295
I don't know.
Make some shit up.

194

Hey, what happened to you?

199
00:16:38,711 --> 00:16:39,973
Nothing.

200
00:16:40,046 --> 00:16:41,946
Listen, do you want to
go down to the Mill

201
00:16:42,014 --> 00:16:43,003
and grab a beer later?

202
00:16:43,115 --> 00:16:44,082
No, thanks.

203
00:16:44,150 --> 00:16:45,947
- You don't drink?
- I do.

204
00:16:46,052 --> 00:16:47,451
You don't want to drink with me?

205
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:49,385
- I don't like bars very much.
- Oh.

206
00:16:49,455 --> 00:16:52,424
Hey, how about I go get a six?
We can have it right here.

207
00:16:53,259 --> 00:16:54,453
No, thanks.

208

What are you gonna do?

209
00:16:56,529 --> 00:16:58,497
I'm going for a walk.

210
00:16:58,564 --> 00:17:00,088
Oh, cool.

211
00:17:00,166 --> 00:17:01,827
You mind if I come along, man?

212
00:17:01,901 --> 00:17:03,198
I need the exercise.

213
00:17:03,269 --> 00:17:04,668
I'm turning into a fat shit.

214
00:17:04,737 --> 00:17:06,534
I usually go alone.

215
00:17:06,605 --> 00:17:08,800
I'm a good walker, bro.

216
00:17:08,874 --> 00:17:10,637
I prefer to go alone.

217
00:17:10,710 --> 00:17:12,678
Okay.
All right.

218
00:17:12,745 --> 00:17:14,508
Maybe next time, right?

I never told you my name.

227
00:19:01,687 --> 00:19:03,985

Do you have any glasses?

234
00:19:31,417 --> 00:19:34,853
Or we could just swig
from the bottle.

235
00:19:34,954 --> 00:19:36,285
I have mugs.

236
00:19:36,355 --> 00:19:37,720
Oh.

237
00:19:57,042 --> 00:19:59,510
When I was 19,
I actually slept with a guy

238
00:19:59,578 --> 00:20:02,069
because he rolled
his own cigarettes.

239
00:20:07,453 --> 00:20:09,250

Oh, shit.
It's mine.

247
00:20:33,612 --> 00:20:35,842
I always forget
I have this thing.

248
00:20:35,948 --> 00:20:39,315
My husband gave it to me
in case of an emergency.

249
00:20:39,385 --> 00:20:41,478
Although he's not
my husband right now.

What is this?

260
00:21:05,744 --> 00:21:07,302
It's an old ticket box.

00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:35,492
Yes.

554
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,693
We don't have to talk.
We can just eat.

555
00:38:39,764 --> 00:38:41,288
I'm cool with that.

556
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:42,833
Okay.

557
00:38:54,612 --> 00:38:57,547
Hey, Sancho Panza,
what's this called again?

558
00:38:58,149 --> 00:38:59,377
Walking the right-of-way.

559
00:38:59,484 --> 00:39:00,815
How am I doing?

560
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:02,877
You're doing okay.

561
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:05,285
I told you
I was a good walker, bro.

562
00:39:11,562 --> 00:39:12,494
Boom!

563
00:39:12,563 --> 00:39:14,053
Give me another one.

564
00:39:16,734 --> 00:39:17,996
That one?

565
00:39:26,344 --> 00:39:27,072
Boom!

566
00:39:29,714 --> 00:39:30,942
Hi.

567
00:39:31,049 --> 00:39:33,313
- Hey.
- Hi.

568
00:39:33,418 --> 00:39:35,352
Did you get any mail yet?

569
00:39:35,420 --> 00:39:36,717
No.

570
00:39:38,623 --> 00:39:39,521
Bye.

571
00:39:39,590 --> 00:39:41,751
You're fucking
unbelievable, bro.

572
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:47,462
I don't suppose you
want to grab a beer.

573
00:39:47,532 --> 00:39:49,397
No, thanks.

574
00:39:49,467 --> 00:39:50,957
You gotta get over
the bar thing.

575
00:39:51,035 --> 00:39:52,127
Seriously.

576
00:40:10,288 --> 00:40:14,019

Hi.

585
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,014
Hi.

586
00:40:39,016 --> 00:40:41,348
What are you doing?

587
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,046
I was looking for Fin.

588
00:40:43,154 --> 00:40:44,746
What's your name?

589
00:40:45,289 --> 00:40:47,780
Cleo.
What's your name?

590
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:49,291
Olivia.

591
00:40:50,728 --> 00:40:52,696
Are you Fin's mother?

592
00:40:52,764 --> 00:40:54,459
No.

593
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,864
No, I'm just his friend.

594
00:40:56,934 --> 00:41:00,335
Do you want to see
my spike collection?

595
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:02,736
I don't know.
What's a spike collection?

596
00:41:02,807 --> 00:41:05,241
You know, like, train spikes?

597
00:41:05,309 --> 00:41:06,776
Oh.

598
00:41:07,278 --> 00:41:08,802
Actually,
that sounds kind of cool.

599
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,904
I'd like that.

600
00:41:09,981 --> 00:41:12,211
Come on.

601
00:41:12,316 --> 00:41:13,806
I don't need a ticket?

602
00:41:13,918 --> 00:41:14,885
No.

603
00:41:14,986 --> 00:41:16,715
- You sure?
- Yeah.

604
00:41:17,889 --> 00:41:20,016
Be careful.

605
00:41:20,091 --> 00:41:22,992
JOE: Hey, how about from
L.A. to San Francisco?

606
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:24,823
FIN:
The Starlight Express.

607
00:41:24,896 --> 00:41:26,557
JOE: That's gotta be
fucking beautiful.

608
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:29,031
FIN: Yeah, but I think
the Zephyr would be better.

609
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:31,728
JOE: The Zephyr?
Where does that go?

610
00:41:31,803 --> 00:41:34,169
FIN: Through the Rocky Mountains
outside of Denver.

611
00:41:34,238 --> 00:41:36,138
Great mountain passes.

612
00:41:40,578 --> 00:41:41,602
CLEO:
Hey, Fin!

613
00:41:41,679 --> 00:41:44,045
Somebody left you something.

614
00:41:49,187 --> 00:41:51,018
Ooh, what's that?

615
00:41:54,959 --> 00:41:57,291
"Happy moviemaking.
Olivia."

616
00:41:57,361 --> 00:41:59,386
What's it for?

617
00:41:59,463 --> 00:42:00,395
Train chasing.

618
00:42:00,464 --> 00:42:02,295
No, it's not.

619
00:42:02,366 --> 00:42:03,856
Yeah, it is.

620
00:42:05,036 --> 00:42:06,799
- Can I see?
- Nope.

621
00:42:14,745 --> 00:42:16,906
[Train passing]

622
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:29,919
Hey.
I know. I'm late.

623
00:42:31,262 --> 00:42:33,628
My pop was up coughing
all night.

624
00:42:33,698 --> 00:42:35,188
He kept me up.

625
00:42:36,567 --> 00:42:38,797
Hey, grab those chairs,
would you?

626
00:42:39,604 --> 00:42:41,538
Hey, man, question.

627
00:42:41,606 --> 00:42:43,506
Why don't you ever sit
in the lounge?

628
00:42:43,574 --> 00:42:44,871
The lounge?

629
00:42:44,942 --> 00:42:46,569
The lounge.

630
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:49,746
I like to read when I eat.

631
00:42:49,814 --> 00:42:51,577
You can't read in the lounge?

632
00:42:51,682 --> 00:42:53,013
You'll talk to me.

633
00:42:54,018 --> 00:42:55,645
Not if you don't want me to.

634
00:42:55,753 --> 00:42:56,811
Fin, I promise.

635
00:42:56,921 --> 00:42:58,980
I'll read, too.
I got a book in here.

636
00:43:01,158 --> 00:43:02,318
Here.

637
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:04,352
I'll read, too.

638
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,733
This isn't so bad, right?

639
00:43:18,242 --> 00:43:19,607
Right.

640
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:24,137
You reading about trains?

641
00:43:24,515 --> 00:43:25,982
Yep.

642
00:43:26,050 --> 00:43:26,914
You know what?

643
00:43:27,018 --> 00:43:28,986
You should get a job
on the railroad.

644
00:43:29,053 --> 00:43:32,580
You said you weren't gonna talk
to me if I sat here, Joe.

645
00:43:32,690 --> 00:43:35,284
I haven't said anything in,
like, 20 minutes.

646
00:43:39,964 --> 00:43:40,862
Nine.

647
00:43:40,932 --> 00:43:43,730
- You timed me?
- Mm-hmm.

648
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,600
That's cold, bro.

649
00:43:47,605 --> 00:43:49,766
Hey, you gonna walk
the right-of-way today?

650
00:43:49,840 --> 00:43:51,467
No.

651
00:43:51,542 --> 00:43:52,907
Tomorrow?

652
00:43:53,778 --> 00:43:55,336
Yeah.

653

[Dialing]

654
00:44:05,156 --> 00:44:08,683
The number for Olivia Harris
on Green Pond Road.

655
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,021
Thank you.

656
00:44:12,229 --> 00:44:14,493
What?
Go back to your book, man.

657
00:44:39,123 --> 00:44:41,353
I don't think we should do this.

658
00:44:41,425 --> 00:44:42,722
Seriously?

659
00:44:42,793 --> 00:44:44,090
Come on.
You can do it.

660
00:44:44,161 --> 00:44:46,652
This is a little scary.

661
00:44:55,072 --> 00:44:56,835
This is really beautiful,
Fin.

662
00:44:56,907 --> 00:45:00,308
You sure there's no trains
on this track?

663
00:45:00,378 --> 00:45:03,404
No, it stops right down there.

664
00:45:04,081 --> 00:45:05,810
I'm starving.

665
00:45:05,916 --> 00:45:07,349
You want some beef jerky?

666
00:45:07,418 --> 00:45:09,113
Absolutely.

667
00:45:10,087 --> 00:45:11,952
You had it all this time?

668
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:16,525
Want some?

669
00:45:16,594 --> 00:45:18,061
I'll pass.

That was a good walk.

677
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:01,968
[Exhales deeply]

678
00:46:02,039 --> 00:46:04,940
Why is it called
"walking the right-of-way"?

679
00:46:05,009 --> 00:46:07,375
It's complicated.
You know, it's, uh...

00:46:07,445 --> 00:46:09,208
[Children laughing]

681
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,908
I'll let Fin answer this one.
Fin?

682
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:14,211
When the railroads
were being built,

683
00:46:14,318 --> 00:46:18,084
the government took
a lot of private land,

684
00:46:18,155 --> 00:46:20,623
saying the railroad needed
the right-of-way

685
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,487
through the property.

686
00:46:23,928 --> 00:46:25,725
Hey, can we get some sodas?

687
00:46:25,796 --> 00:46:27,627
We're closed!

688
00:46:27,698 --> 00:46:29,928

00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:13,304
Uh, I'm gonna... I'm gonna go.

00:47:13,878 --> 00:47:16,346
I'll see you later.

We want to screen it.

We can either do it at Fin's
pathetic little hovel of a home

721

at your beautiful home

You're early.

No.

in the fridge

732

and liquor in that funny
little cabinet in the corner.

I heard that, Joe.

What? I was just talking
about the view.

737
00:50:00,911 --> 00:50:02,469
Bullshit.

738
00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,036
It's just that
they're a little...

739
00:50:04,114 --> 00:50:06,139
I don't want to hear it, Joe.

740
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:08,308
What do you think?

741
00:50:10,954 --> 00:50:12,319
What?

742
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:19,991
Hey, Olivia!

743
00:50:20,064 --> 00:50:21,656
You got a garlic press?

744
00:50:21,732 --> 00:50:22,596
No.

745
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:24,600
How can you not have
a garlic press?

746
00:50:24,668 --> 00:50:26,602
Still no.

747
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:28,194
All right.
You keep talkin'.

748
00:50:28,272 --> 00:50:30,706
I'm gonna go cook
without the garlic press.

749
00:50:30,774 --> 00:50:32,799
I'm not used to having people
in my house.

750
00:50:32,876 --> 00:50:34,810
Especially loud people.

751
00:50:34,878 --> 00:50:36,846
It's a nice house.

752
00:50:37,348 --> 00:50:39,043
Yeah.

753
00:50:39,416 --> 00:50:42,408
David bought it
as a getaway place, so...

754
00:50:42,519 --> 00:50:44,987
I moved down here and got away.

755
00:50:45,055 --> 00:50:46,784
Where did you used to live?

756
00:50:46,857 --> 00:50:48,552
Princeton.

757
00:50:48,625 --> 00:50:50,684
I know.
I didn't get very far.

758
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:53,127
I just couldn't stay there
another minute.

759
00:50:53,197 --> 00:50:56,462
Everyone looking at me.
The poor woman whose son died.

760
00:50:59,169 --> 00:51:01,034
How about you?

761
00:51:01,105 --> 00:51:03,665
What made you pick Newfoundland?

762
00:51:04,942 --> 00:51:07,604
I wanted to live near Joe.

763
00:51:10,614 --> 00:51:11,603
Guys.

764
00:51:11,715 --> 00:51:15,617
Would you come up here and talk?
Seriously, this sucks.

765
00:51:41,111 --> 00:51:43,306
JOE:
Finbar McBride!

766
00:51:43,380 --> 00:51:46,076
Whoo, we're train-chasing, baby!

767
00:51:46,183 --> 00:51:47,673
Trains are really cool.

768
00:51:47,785 --> 00:51:49,309
They are.

769
00:51:51,588 --> 00:51:53,351
So are horses.

770
00:51:53,424 --> 00:51:55,255
JOE: Whoo!

771
00:51:55,325 --> 00:51:56,587
What?

772
00:51:59,062 --> 00:52:01,223
I was just thinking that.

773
00:52:02,132 --> 00:52:03,963
Give me the joint, man.

774
00:52:05,803 --> 00:52:08,067
JOE:
This fuckin' train is huge!

775
00:52:08,439 --> 00:52:10,839
Shh. Shh.

776
00:52:11,208 --> 00:52:12,402
JOE: Yeah!

777
00:52:18,282 --> 00:52:20,750
Have you ever been in love, Fin?

778
00:52:24,021 --> 00:52:25,352
Yeah.

779
00:52:27,925 --> 00:52:29,552
What happened?

780
00:52:33,397 --> 00:52:36,059
I was young...

781
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:39,362
and, uh...

782
00:52:39,436 --> 00:52:41,233
really angry.

783
00:52:42,873 --> 00:52:44,864
About what?

784
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,102
Um...

785
00:52:51,782 --> 00:52:53,511
Being a dwarf.

786
00:52:57,754 --> 00:53:00,086
You know, it's, uh...

787
00:53:03,160 --> 00:53:06,618
It's really funny how...

788
00:53:07,698 --> 00:53:10,098
different people...

789
00:53:10,167 --> 00:53:13,625
see me and treat me.

790
00:53:17,908 --> 00:53:26,407
Because I'm actually just
a very simple, boring person.

791
00:53:31,421 --> 00:53:32,888
What about you?

792
00:53:32,990 --> 00:53:35,788
Are you still in love
with David?

793
00:53:37,160 --> 00:53:38,627
Yes.

794
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,168
I don't think he's moving.

795
00:53:46,103 --> 00:53:47,593
I'll wake him.

796
00:53:47,671 --> 00:53:50,731
No, you're not gonna have
any luck.

797
00:53:52,042 --> 00:53:54,738
- Maybe I should go.
- No. No.

798
00:53:54,811 --> 00:53:57,245
You're not leaving.
You're both staying here.

799
00:53:57,314 --> 00:54:00,681
And don't argue
because I'm just too tired.

800
00:54:00,751 --> 00:54:02,480
Would you like some water?

801
00:54:02,586 --> 00:54:04,918
No. I'm all right.
Thanks.

802
00:54:12,362 --> 00:54:14,421
- You can get under the covers.
- No.

803
00:54:14,498 --> 00:54:15,430
I'm fine.

804
00:54:15,499 --> 00:54:17,364
I brought you some water anyway.

805
00:54:17,434 --> 00:54:20,267
And a towel.

806
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:23,902
That's Sam, huh?

807
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:25,601
Yeah.

808
00:54:37,955 --> 00:54:40,446
He fell off the monkey bars.

809
00:54:43,460 --> 00:54:46,190
I turned my head for a second.

810
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,359
Looks like a happy kid.

811
00:54:54,471 --> 00:54:55,870
He was.

812
00:55:00,978 --> 00:55:02,445
Well...

813
00:55:02,846 --> 00:55:05,280
- Good night.
- Good night.

814
00:55:56,767 --> 00:55:57,756
Hi.

815
00:55:58,602 --> 00:55:59,500
Who are you?

816
00:55:59,569 --> 00:56:00,934
I'm Fin.

817
00:56:01,772 --> 00:56:02,864
Where's Olivia?

818
00:56:02,939 --> 00:56:05,271
I think she's upstairs sleeping.

819
00:56:06,043 --> 00:56:07,533
Hey, you're Olivia's ex.

820
00:56:07,611 --> 00:56:08,839
I just saw your picture
in the kitchen.

821
00:56:08,912 --> 00:56:10,277
Yes.

822
00:56:11,048 --> 00:56:12,777
I'm Joe.

823
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:16,011
I think Olivia's sleeping, man.
Tore it up last night.

824
00:56:16,119 --> 00:56:17,313
Huh.

825
00:56:22,059 --> 00:56:23,754
David?

826
00:56:23,827 --> 00:56:25,556
Hi.

827
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:26,891
What are you doing here?

828
00:56:26,963 --> 00:56:29,659
I wanted to talk to you.
And you won't call me back.

829
00:56:29,733 --> 00:56:31,098
I didn't feel like talking.

830
00:56:31,168 --> 00:56:33,830
Yeah, yeah, I got that much.

831
00:56:38,041 --> 00:56:41,101
Can you guys leave us alone?

832
00:56:42,412 --> 00:56:43,970
Thanks.

833
00:56:44,414 --> 00:56:46,006
Are you gonna be okay?

834
00:56:46,650 --> 00:56:47,981
Yeah.

835
00:57:00,697 --> 00:57:02,187
DAVID:
You wanna explain that?

836
00:57:02,265 --> 00:57:04,096
- No.
- No, what?

837
00:57:04,167 --> 00:57:06,260
DAVID: I'd just like to know
what the hell's going on.

838
00:57:06,336 --> 00:57:07,997
No, I came all the way down here

839
00:57:08,071 --> 00:57:09,299
because you won't pick up
the phone.

840
00:57:09,372 --> 00:57:10,896
OLIVIA:
I have nothing to say to you!

841
00:57:10,974 --> 00:57:13,636
DAVID: Don't walk away from me.
Can you listen to me?

842
00:57:30,127 --> 00:57:32,061
CLEO:
Fin!

843
00:57:39,770 --> 00:57:40,429
Here, Fin.

844
00:57:40,504 --> 00:57:44,235
It's a permission slip
so you can speak at my school.

845
00:57:48,612 --> 00:57:50,842
I can't speak
at your school, Cleo.

846
00:57:50,914 --> 00:57:51,903
Yes, you can.

847
00:57:51,982 --> 00:57:54,212
You can pick any Friday
that you want.

848
00:57:54,317 --> 00:57:55,807
I'm sorry.
I can't.

849
00:57:55,919 --> 00:57:57,409
Why?

850
00:57:57,521 --> 00:57:59,011
It's just not something
I can do.

851
00:57:59,122 --> 00:58:00,453
You have to!

852
00:58:00,524 --> 00:58:01,718
I'm sorry.

853
00:58:01,792 --> 00:58:05,284
But I already told everyone
you were coming!

854
00:58:05,362 --> 00:58:06,260
I'm sorry, Cleo.

855
00:58:06,329 --> 00:58:07,523
No, you're not.

856
00:58:07,597 --> 00:58:10,122
If you were sorry,
then you would come.

857
00:58:14,638 --> 00:58:17,072
What was that all about?

858
00:58:22,813 --> 00:58:25,509
I guess no coffee
for Olivia today.

859
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:28,249
No.

860
00:58:28,318 --> 00:58:29,876
Guess not.

861
00:58:53,743 --> 00:58:55,802
I didn't like that guy, man.

862
00:58:56,546 --> 00:58:57,205
Who?

863
00:58:57,280 --> 00:58:58,975
Olivia's ex.

864
00:58:59,649 --> 00:59:01,378
Uptight white guy.

865
00:59:03,653 --> 00:59:05,644
Can I ask you
a personal question?

866
00:59:05,755 --> 00:59:07,450
Sure.

867
00:59:07,891 --> 00:59:10,018
You've had sex, right?

868
00:59:11,461 --> 00:59:12,826
Yes.

869
00:59:13,496 --> 00:59:15,657
With a regular-sized chick?

870
00:59:16,600 --> 00:59:17,999
Yeah.

871
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,832
With a regular-sized chick.

872
00:59:21,771 --> 00:59:24,365
You ever had it
with someone your own size?

873
00:59:28,411 --> 00:59:29,708
No.

874
00:59:30,280 --> 00:59:31,577
Do you wanna?

875
00:59:31,681 --> 00:59:33,376
I don't want to talk
about this, Joe.

876
00:59:33,483 --> 00:59:36,748
- Why?
- I just... I just don't.

877
00:59:57,307 --> 00:59:59,400
[Sighs]

878
01:00:25,936 --> 01:00:26,595
Hi.

879
01:00:26,670 --> 01:00:27,796
Hi.

880
01:00:27,871 --> 01:00:28,769
I have my bill.

881
01:00:28,838 --> 01:00:30,328
Oh. Cool.

882
01:00:30,407 --> 01:00:32,602
I can make you out
a card right now.

883
01:00:34,644 --> 01:00:37,306
I just need you
to fill that out.

884
01:00:38,181 --> 01:00:40,911
There you go.
And I'll get your card.

885
01:00:44,988 --> 01:00:46,979
Your first name is Finbar?

886
01:00:47,090 --> 01:00:48,421
Yes.

887
01:00:48,491 --> 01:00:50,220
My name's Emily.

888
01:00:50,293 --> 01:00:51,225
Hi.

889
01:00:51,795 --> 01:00:53,023
Hi.

890
01:00:57,067 --> 01:00:59,058
You have a nice chin.

891
01:01:02,405 --> 01:01:04,236
Thanks.

892
01:01:08,144 --> 01:01:10,305
JOE: A nice chin?
[Scoffs]

893
01:01:10,380 --> 01:01:11,608
FIN: Yeah.

894
01:01:12,549 --> 01:01:13,914
JOE: Seriously?

895
01:01:14,017 --> 01:01:15,177
FIN: Yeah.

896
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:17,744
JOE: Fuckin' weird.

897
01:01:27,230 --> 01:01:28,891
That's Olivia.

898
01:01:29,332 --> 01:01:31,163
Hey! Olivia!

899
01:01:31,901 --> 01:01:32,868
That was her, right?

900
01:01:32,936 --> 01:01:35,097
I think so.

901
01:01:35,772 --> 01:01:37,296
What was that?

902
01:01:37,374 --> 01:01:38,568
She had to see us, right?

903
01:01:38,641 --> 01:01:40,802
[Cellphone ringing]

904
01:01:44,848 --> 01:01:45,906
Shit.

905
01:01:47,083 --> 01:01:49,176
[Speaking Spanish]

906
01:01:52,455 --> 01:01:54,423
It's my pop.
We're going to the Mill tonight.

907
01:01:54,491 --> 01:01:56,550
He wants to know
if you want to join us.

908
01:01:56,626 --> 01:01:57,752
Okay.

909
01:01:57,827 --> 01:01:59,988
Really?

910
01:02:00,063 --> 01:02:01,325
Yeah.

911
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:05,430

912
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:10,428
[Telephone rings]

913
01:02:10,507 --> 01:02:12,532
Yeah, Good to Go.

914
01:02:13,076 --> 01:02:14,873
Yeah, okay.
Address?

915
01:02:14,944 --> 01:02:18,107
34 Green Pond Road.
Yeah. Name?

916
01:02:18,181 --> 01:02:20,149
Harris.
All right.

917
01:02:20,216 --> 01:02:22,343
Right, okay.
Two of those.

918
01:02:22,452 --> 01:02:23,419
Yeah.

919
01:02:23,486 --> 01:02:26,421
All right.
Yeah. Is that it?

920
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:28,582
Okay, my delivery boy's
out of the store now,

921
01:02:28,658 --> 01:02:30,751
so it's gonna be

01:15:41,483 --> 01:15:43,144
- Are you all right?
- You're not a child!

1104
01:15:43,252 --> 01:15:46,949
Get off the fucking porch,
and leave me alone!

1107
01:16:35,271 --> 01:16:36,260
Two.

1108
01:16:39,375 --> 01:16:41,138

Oh!

Here I am!

1114
01:17:42,771 --> 01:17:44,796
Take a look.

1115
01:17:47,710 --> 01:17:49,735
Take a look!

1116
01:17:51,180 --> 01:17:54,581

[Groans]

1122
01:20:20,562 --> 01:20:22,496
Olivia?

1123
01:20:28,504 --> 01:20:30,096
Olivia?

1124
01:20:42,217 --> 01:20:43,844
Olivia?

1125

I want Sam back.

your full attention.

"I am here
to speak about trains.

1146
01:23:57,312 --> 01:23:59,303
The first real train
in this country

1147
01:23:59,381 --> 01:24:02,043
was built by Peter Cooper
in 1829.

1148
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:05,085
Does anyone know
what it was called?"

1149
01:24:08,457 --> 01:24:10,891
"It was called the Tom Thumb."

[Students giggling]

1151
01:24:15,030 --> 01:24:16,122
"Since that time,

1152
01:24:16,198 --> 01:24:20,726
trains have helped make
this country what it is today.

1153
01:24:20,802 --> 01:24:22,099
A long time ago,

1154
01:24:22,170 --> 01:24:26,072
most people never left their
towns because travel was hard."

1155
01:24:26,141 --> 01:24:27,165
Uh, yes?

1156
01:24:27,242 --> 01:24:28,766
How tall are you?

1157
01:24:28,844 --> 01:24:30,209
Jacob!

1158
01:24:30,579 --> 01:24:33,446
I'm, uh... I'm four feet
and five inches tall.

1159
01:24:33,548 --> 01:24:35,379
I'm taller than you.

1160
01:24:35,484 --> 01:24:37,076
Jacob, come with me.

1161
01:24:37,185 --> 01:24:38,117
I'm so sorry.

1162

Be back in a minute.

1163
01:24:40,455 --> 01:24:42,218
Such a jerk.

1164
01:24:49,197 --> 01:24:51,597
What about blimps?

1165
01:24:51,666 --> 01:24:53,293
I think blimps came later.

1166
01:24:53,368 --> 01:24:54,835
When?

1167
01:24:55,437 --> 01:24:56,995
I'm not sure exactly.

1168
01:24:57,072 --> 01:24:58,562
Blimps are cool.

1169
01:24:58,640 --> 01:25:00,335
Well, so are trains.

1170
01:25:00,409 --> 01:25:03,435
Yeah, well, they're both cool.

1171
01:25:03,845 --> 01:25:05,745
Trains and blimps.

1172
01:25:16,324 --> 01:25:18,588
Anybody hungry for dessert?

1173
01:25:18,960 --> 01:25:20,018
I'm stuffed.

1174
01:25:20,095 --> 01:25:21,756
Yeah. Me, too.

1175
01:25:23,265 --> 01:25:24,527
There's plenty of food.

1176
01:25:24,599 --> 01:25:26,965
We can have it
for lunch tomorrow.

1177
01:25:36,344 --> 01:25:38,744
Hey, when were blimps invented?

1178
01:25:41,183 --> 01:25:42,980
I have no idea.

1179
01:25:43,084 --> 01:25:45,245
Yeah, me neither.

1180
01:25:46,221 --> 01:25:50,214
You can go down to the library
and ask that little hottie.

1181
01:25:50,325 --> 01:25:52,122
She is cute.

1182
01:25:52,194 --> 01:25:54,856
It's the librarian fantasy, man.

1183

Glasses off, hair down.

1184

Books flying.

1185
01:26:01,536 --> 01:26:03,629
She doesn't wear glasses.

1186
01:26:03,705 --> 01:26:06,173
Well, buy her some.
It's worth it.
