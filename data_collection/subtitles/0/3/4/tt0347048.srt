1
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:02,186
I want to get in.

2
00:00:02,587 --> 00:00:07,138
Sorry but without girl you can't enter.
- My wife is in there.

3
00:00:07,507 --> 00:00:10,305
I don't give a fuck.
- You don't? - Yea.

4
00:00:10,707 --> 00:00:14,097
Fuck you!
- Hey, fuck you. - No, no.

5
00:00:13,867 --> 00:00:15,141
Hold on.

6
00:00:15,587 --> 00:00:16,781
That's my husband.

7
00:00:17,187 --> 00:00:20,099
Ok, that's your husband.

8
00:00:20,227 --> 00:00:22,422
But calm down.

9
00:00:22,787 --> 00:00:25,540
Don't make a riot in there.
- ok.

10
00:00:26,507 --> 00:00:28,498
It's ok guys.

11
00:00:28,907 --> 00:00:29,862
Peace!

12
00:00:38,547 --> 00:00:39,502
Sibel!

13
00:00:45,187 --> 00:00:49,021
I'm sorry that I ran away.

14
00:00:50,307 --> 00:00:52,059
It's ok.

15
00:00:52,467 --> 00:00:54,378
I've gone crazy?

16
00:00:55,307 --> 00:00:56,706
Everybody does.

17
00:01:29,907 --> 00:01:33,946
Hey babe. Are you all right?
- What do you want? - Can't you see I want you!

18
00:01:34,347 --> 00:01:36,622
Piss off!
- Hey, keep cool babe!

19
00:01:36,987 --> 00:01:40,138
Hey, that's my wife.
- What? - Cahit!

20
00:01:40,507 --> 00:01:42,782
What Cahit...
Hold on!

21
00:02:01,931 --> 00:02:04,365
Your face isn't blessed that much.

22
00:02:06,411 --> 00:02:09,005
I just try to look good.

23
00:02:23,651 --> 00:02:24,800
Bastards.

24
00:02:25,931 --> 00:02:28,240
Why? You are one of them.

25
00:02:41,451 --> 00:02:43,362
I know so little from you.

26
00:02:56,211 --> 00:02:58,122
Then get to know me better.

27
00:04:34,051 --> 00:04:35,325
Stop!

28
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:38,086
Stop it! Stop!

29
00:04:39,811 --> 00:04:42,689
I can't! I can't!

30
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:47,560
If we do it you are my husband
and I am your wife.

31
00:04:49,051 --> 00:04:50,166
Do you understand?

32
00:04:58,371 --> 00:04:59,804
I'm in love!

33
00:05:02,331 --> 00:05:03,650
In love!

34
00:05:04,331 --> 00:05:05,764
She bewitched me.

35
00:05:06,171 --> 00:05:09,402
Stop it boy!
I say stop it!

36
00:05:11,571 --> 00:05:14,563
Forget your love.
Look how you look like!

37
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:17,128
Do you even know what love is?

38
00:05:18,251 --> 00:05:20,367
Love is a carousel!

39
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:26,921
Always in a circle,
but you only have a wooden horse!

40
00:05:29,331 --> 00:05:33,529
You don't understand!
You don't understand!

41
00:06:32,171 --> 00:06:34,002
She was called Katharina.

42
00:06:34,371 --> 00:06:36,282
A very happy person.

43
00:06:38,171 --> 00:06:40,002
Like a kid.

44
00:06:41,891 --> 00:06:43,324
She always smiled.

45
00:06:45,251 --> 00:06:46,889
Everybody liked her.

46
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:51,121
I really liked her.

47
00:06:52,651 --> 00:06:55,165
What did she do?
- She painted.

48
00:06:57,451 --> 00:06:58,884
Did Cahit love her?

49
00:07:04,811 --> 00:07:06,005
Yes, a lot.

50
00:07:10,891 --> 00:07:13,121
What a strange relationship
do you have to him?

51
00:07:16,491 --> 00:07:18,686
He is my husband and I am his wife.

52
00:07:21,411 --> 00:07:23,242
Do you love each other?

53
00:07:24,131 --> 00:07:25,883
You wouldn't understand that.

54
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,207
Yea I guess I'm too stupid.

55
00:07:33,011 --> 00:07:35,366
I don't even understand it.

56
00:07:40,291 --> 00:07:42,521
Cahit and I fuck
from time to time.

57
00:07:59,291 --> 00:08:01,088
Sibel!
- What are you doing here?

58
00:08:03,451 --> 00:08:05,169
I wanted to see you.
- Why?

59
00:08:06,411 --> 00:08:10,324
Niko, listen. We slept together.
I wanted to know how you are in bed.

60
00:08:10,851 --> 00:08:14,082
Now I know it.
You step aside and I do, ok?

61
00:08:14,451 --> 00:08:16,965
What's this? - Get your fingers off me!
I'm a married woman.

62
00:08:17,331 --> 00:08:20,767
I'm a married Turkish woman and if you come to close
my husband kills you. Understood?

63
00:08:39,811 --> 00:08:41,722
When did she marry?

64
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:41,960
Tell me, what a bad
husband are you!

65
00:09:46,091 --> 00:09:49,322
Your girl hangs out
and you don't care.

66
00:09:52,331 --> 00:09:54,162
Do you even fuck her?

67
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,883
Ah?

68
00:09:58,291 --> 00:10:00,122
You are a pimp right?

69
00:10:01,251 --> 00:10:04,288
Fuck you!
- Niko, you talk to much.

70
00:10:05,291 --> 00:10:07,202
Do you earn enough money with her pussy?

71
00:10:11,051 --> 00:10:12,370
Tell me...

72
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:16,929
How much would it cost to
fuck her in the ass?

73
00:10:20,371 --> 00:10:22,123
50 Euros are enough?

74
00:10:23,291 --> 00:10:25,885
In the brothel it's called 'Greek'?

75
00:10:28,131 --> 00:10:30,406
I want to fuck a Turk
in the Greek way!

76
00:10:36,491 --> 00:10:37,446
Niko!

77
00:10:39,051 --> 00:10:40,006
Niko!

78
00:10:44,251 --> 00:10:45,809
Call a doctor!

79
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:41,244
ACT OF JEALOUSY IN ST. PAULI

80
00:14:14,851 --> 00:14:17,126
Listen,
you cant stay here.

81
00:14:17,771 --> 00:14:20,444
You have to leave tomorrow morning.
Without being seen.

82
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,841
Otherwise they tear me to pieces!

83
00:14:26,691 --> 00:14:28,170
Did you understand me?

84
00:14:30,131 --> 00:14:31,200
Yes.

85
00:14:32,931 --> 00:14:36,003
Isn't there anybody you could go to?
Give me an answer!

86
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:37,761
No.

87
00:14:41,011 --> 00:14:42,888
Holy shit!

88
00:14:46,091 --> 00:14:48,366
And what do you want to do now?

89
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:52,810
They will kill me.

90
00:14:53,171 --> 00:14:56,322
Who?
- My family.

91
00:14:59,331 --> 00:15:02,767
Your family!
What do you expect?

92
00:15:03,051 --> 00:15:06,327
You mess up all the time and then:
"My family..."!

93
00:15:07,011 --> 00:15:08,808
There must be someone in Turkey?

94
00:15:10,931 --> 00:15:12,523
Yes I do...
- Go there.

95
00:15:14,011 --> 00:15:15,080
And what about Cahit?

96
00:15:15,411 --> 00:15:17,845
What does Cahit bother you?

97
00:15:18,611 --> 00:15:21,079
Can't you see what you
have done to him?

98
00:15:21,731 --> 00:15:24,291
You ruined his life!

99
00:15:25,371 --> 00:15:26,963
"And Cahit"!

100
00:15:33,491 --> 00:15:34,606
Listen,

101
00:15:37,171 --> 00:15:39,241
you really love Cahit?

102
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:43,646
Yes.

103
00:15:44,931 --> 00:15:47,923
Then do him a favor:

104
00:15:48,691 --> 00:15:49,646
Go!

105
00:16:11,331 --> 00:16:18,362
Why do you cry,
black haired beauty?

106
00:16:26,811 --> 00:16:32,329
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

107
00:16:34,011 --> 00:16:39,244
Even if your lament
climbs up to the sky.

108
00:16:39,731 --> 00:16:45,920
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

109
00:17:01,971 --> 00:17:07,489
What ever happens,
after every winter there comes spring.

110
00:17:09,051 --> 00:17:15,524
Everything the appears
disappears again. Don't cry.

111
00:17:30,651 --> 00:17:33,961
Please do not hand over or
take over things.

112
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:37,010
Please don't talk about the
actual case either.

113
00:17:37,411 --> 00:17:39,561
Please close the door.

114
00:18:21,531 --> 00:18:22,930
I will wait for you.

115
00:19:57,051 --> 00:19:59,007
Fasten you seatbelt, Sibel.

116
00:20:04,491 --> 00:20:06,004
Your hair looks beautiful!

117
00:20:08,411 --> 00:20:09,890
Are you hungry?

118
00:20:10,411 --> 00:20:11,366
No.

119
00:20:16,931 --> 00:20:18,967
What do you want to do now?

120
00:20:20,531 --> 00:20:22,010
Can you get me a job?

121
00:20:22,771 --> 00:20:23,920
In a hairdresser's salon?

122
00:20:26,571 --> 00:20:27,765
I don't care.

123
00:20:30,171 --> 00:20:31,889
We will see...

124
00:20:32,531 --> 00:20:35,682
Smile!

125
00:20:50,491 --> 00:20:51,765
How is it going?

126
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:53,361
Fine.

127
00:20:56,171 --> 00:20:57,729
Sibel, don't worry.

128
00:20:57,971 --> 00:21:00,087
It's just for a short while.

129
00:21:01,171 --> 00:21:03,162
I'm waiting for barber
Ahmet's reply.

130
00:21:03,411 --> 00:21:06,721
As soon as there is a job
needed you're in.

131
00:21:12,691 --> 00:21:15,285
Take care!
I'm right there!

132
00:21:19,491 --> 00:21:21,049
Do you like the hotel?

133
00:21:26,891 --> 00:21:28,961
Shall I tell you a secret?

134
00:21:29,571 --> 00:21:33,359
One day I will be
responsible for all this.

135
00:21:34,011 --> 00:21:37,640
In a few years I will
manage the hotel...

136
00:21:38,771 --> 00:21:41,205
Then you can work here.
!

137
00:21:41,491 --> 00:21:43,004
How do you like that?

138
00:21:45,451 --> 00:21:47,919
You can only trust yourself

139
00:21:54,891 --> 00:21:56,529
Can I get a Raki?

140
00:22:08,451 --> 00:22:10,123
Do you miss Cahit?

141
00:22:39,251 --> 00:22:40,843
Go for it, Sibel!

142
00:23:47,011 --> 00:23:50,686
I go to that date and
enter the elevator.

143
00:23:50,931 --> 00:23:56,801
That's an old building with
elevators from the 80ies.

144
00:23:57,171 --> 00:24:02,962
You reach the top but you can't open the door.
There is a wall...

145
00:24:19,091 --> 00:24:20,683
You are not from here right?

146
00:24:23,491 --> 00:24:25,243
How do you know?

147
00:24:25,691 --> 00:24:27,170
l just know it.

148
00:24:30,371 --> 00:24:31,690
Listen guys...

149
00:24:34,611 --> 00:24:37,330
Where can I get drugs?

150
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,327
You are crazy?

151
00:25:01,771 --> 00:25:02,760
Where have you been?

152
00:25:03,171 --> 00:25:05,321
Hanging out.
- Where?

153
00:25:05,771 --> 00:25:07,602
My business.
- Sibel!

154
00:25:20,371 --> 00:25:21,770
My dear husband,

155
00:25:22,171 --> 00:25:24,321
A few weeks have passed
since I'm here.

156
00:25:24,731 --> 00:25:27,450
Istanbul is a colorful city.
Full of live.

157
00:25:27,851 --> 00:25:29,603
The only one who isn't alive is me.

158
00:25:30,371 --> 00:25:32,487
All I do is trying to survive.

159
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:39,123
Allah is testing us. Allah?

160
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:43,370
Allah? I don't know how to believe in him
after everything that has happened.

161
00:25:43,771 --> 00:25:47,161
You got the harder lot

162
00:25:47,571 --> 00:25:50,563
But prison is the only thing that I can
think of if I think of my live here.

163
00:25:50,971 --> 00:25:54,759
I'm working as maid at the Marmora hotel.
Selma got me the job.

164
00:25:55,531 --> 00:25:57,999
Selma, who I admired so much.

165
00:25:58,411 --> 00:26:01,323
Now there's only contempt.

166
00:26:01,691 --> 00:26:03,443
I hope you are fine.

167
00:26:03,451 --> 00:26:05,123
Hugs and kisses. Sibel

168
00:26:36,091 --> 00:26:37,490
Are you looking for somebody?

169
00:26:39,771 --> 00:26:40,965
I'm looking for drugs.

170
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:48,360
What drugs?

171
00:26:50,171 --> 00:26:51,240
Doesn't matter.

172
00:27:17,251 --> 00:27:19,845
What's that?
- Opium.

173
00:27:24,291 --> 00:27:25,724
You want to try it out?

174
00:27:28,691 --> 00:27:30,522
Give it to me.

175
00:27:33,891 --> 00:27:35,609
Hit...

176
00:27:51,651 --> 00:27:53,801
You can work for me...

177
00:27:56,931 --> 00:28:00,162
You can live here too
if you want...

178
00:28:10,691 --> 00:28:12,966
What's up?
- Im moving.

179
00:28:13,331 --> 00:28:17,370
Where do you want to go to?
- I met a few people.

180
00:28:17,851 --> 00:28:19,170
What kind of people?

181
00:28:20,411 --> 00:28:24,484
Just people...
- Sibel. Don't go.

182
00:28:25,411 --> 00:28:28,608
To become like you?
Working, sleeping, working...

183
00:28:28,851 --> 00:28:32,685
That's why you got divorced!

184
00:30:01,491 --> 00:30:02,810
Sibel!

185
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:06,729
Yes...

186
00:30:08,091 --> 00:30:09,809
Go!

187
00:30:31,891 --> 00:30:33,449
Hey, babe!

188
00:30:33,851 --> 00:30:36,843
What are you doing on the
street at this time?

189
00:30:37,171 --> 00:30:38,445
Did you get lost?

190
00:30:38,851 --> 00:30:42,924
Do you need a man?
Hold on!

191
00:30:45,971 --> 00:30:49,327
Go home and fuck your mothers!

192
00:30:49,971 --> 00:30:51,484
Stop laughing!

193
00:30:57,891 --> 00:30:59,006
Bitch!

194
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:09,489
That's enough! That's enough!

195
00:31:23,451 --> 00:31:26,443
Son of a bitch!
That's all you got?

196
00:31:26,691 --> 00:31:28,363
Girl, piss off!

197
00:31:30,091 --> 00:31:32,207
I fuck you now!

198
00:31:34,091 --> 00:31:36,207
Who do you want to fuck?

199
00:31:38,291 --> 00:31:40,805
Enough? Is it enough now?

200
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:08,766
Fuck you and your families!

201
00:32:09,691 --> 00:32:11,602
What was that?

202
00:32:12,211 --> 00:32:13,405
Fags!

203
00:32:16,051 --> 00:32:17,245
Son of a bitch!

204
00:32:17,971 --> 00:32:19,165
Come here!

205
00:32:27,051 --> 00:32:28,370
Holy shit!

206
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:33,011
Oh my God I killed her!

207
00:32:33,851 --> 00:32:35,284
Damnit, shit!

208
00:32:36,251 --> 00:32:39,482
Did you want that, did you want that?

209
00:32:40,611 --> 00:32:41,646
Run brother!

210
00:32:41,931 --> 00:32:42,841
Get away!

211
00:32:43,291 --> 00:32:45,805
Get away!

212
00:34:07,411 --> 00:34:08,321
Does it taste good?

213
00:34:09,211 --> 00:34:12,328
very good!
- Isn't it?

214
00:34:12,731 --> 00:34:16,565
They have good skewers here.
That's why I come often.

215
00:34:17,371 --> 00:34:19,441
Cheers!

216
00:34:19,971 --> 00:34:21,689
Cheers, Seref!

217
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:34,522
What do you want to do now?

218
00:34:35,411 --> 00:34:36,764
I'm going to Istanbul.

219
00:34:39,011 --> 00:34:40,126
To Sibel?

220
00:34:41,691 --> 00:34:42,760
Yes.

221
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:47,807
Didn't you learn anything?

222
00:34:48,240 --> 00:34:51,357
Hasn't she caused you enough pain already?

222
00:34:52,531 --> 00:34:58,083
Without her I wouldn't have made it.

223
00:34:59,011 --> 00:35:00,330
Made what?

224
00:35:04,211 --> 00:35:05,929
Stay alive!

225
00:35:17,811 --> 00:35:19,164
Good.

226
00:35:22,891 --> 00:35:24,404
Take that!

227
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:27,806
What's that?
- Take it!

228
00:35:34,491 --> 00:35:36,083
I saved it for you!

229
00:35:36,331 --> 00:35:39,607
Take it and got to Turkey!

230
00:35:40,891 --> 00:35:43,200
I can't!
- Take it now!

231
00:35:44,131 --> 00:35:45,246
No.

232
00:35:46,011 --> 00:35:50,368
Im sorry I can't.
- Stop that bullshit!

233
00:35:50,611 --> 00:35:54,809
I'm your uncle. Do you remember?

234
00:36:00,051 --> 00:36:02,326
Let's go to Turkey.

235
00:36:11,051 --> 00:36:11,961
Thank you!

236
00:36:26,491 --> 00:36:27,844
Brother-in-law?

237
00:36:31,331 --> 00:36:33,083
Where is your sister?

238
00:36:35,651 --> 00:36:37,528
I don't have a sister.

239
00:36:39,171 --> 00:36:40,968
But you have the same mother?

240
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:47,083
How does your mother deal with it?

241
00:36:49,091 --> 00:36:51,047
We had to protect our reputation.

242
00:36:51,451 --> 00:36:52,930
You see.

243
00:36:53,931 --> 00:36:54,886
And?

244
00:36:55,891 --> 00:36:58,007
Did you protect you reputation?

245
00:37:28,731 --> 00:37:30,210
Where to?

246
00:37:31,931 --> 00:37:32,920
I dont know.

247
00:37:33,291 --> 00:37:37,762
If you don't even know it how should I know it?
- Go straight ahead!

248
00:37:39,371 --> 00:37:40,645
Okay.

249
00:37:42,251 --> 00:37:44,287
Where are you from?

250
00:37:45,651 --> 00:37:48,802
Hamburg.
- You are from Hamburg?

251
00:37:50,411 --> 00:37:54,086
Yes. - Hey, I'm from Munich!
- Oh my god you are Bavarian?

252
00:37:54,491 --> 00:37:57,608
Well in my last life I used to.
But now I'm here.

253
00:37:57,971 --> 00:37:59,689
They deported me.

254
00:38:00,091 --> 00:38:03,561
Deported, you know!

255
00:38:04,891 --> 00:38:07,485
Why?
- Drugs.

256
00:38:08,371 --> 00:38:09,724
Oh yea.

257
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,168
How shall I continue? Right, left?

258
00:38:13,571 --> 00:38:16,404
Say something.

259
00:38:16,811 --> 00:38:19,245
Get me to a cheap hotel.

260
00:38:19,851 --> 00:38:23,002
There is... Ehm!

261
00:38:23,411 --> 00:38:28,201
Exactly the right thing for your,
"Grand Hotel London."

262
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:38,687
Under friends...
There are ghosts in this house.

263
00:39:05,011 --> 00:39:10,688
The set up is ok.
You placed the logo at the right place,

264
00:39:11,091 --> 00:39:15,528
But in this sample it's too little.
I want it larger.

265
00:39:15,851 --> 00:39:18,319
I don't like the font.

266
00:39:18,571 --> 00:39:21,131
We have to choose one of those.

267
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:23,242
Do you have another sample?

268
00:39:23,491 --> 00:39:26,051
There's somebody who wants
to talk to you. - Who?

269
00:39:32,291 --> 00:39:35,328
Could we continue later?
- Sure.

270
00:39:46,931 --> 00:39:48,410
Hello Selma.

271
00:39:50,011 --> 00:39:50,921
Welcome.

272
00:39:51,891 --> 00:39:52,880
Thanks.

273
00:39:54,131 --> 00:39:55,280
Take a seat.

274
00:39:56,131 --> 00:39:57,246
Yes please.

275
00:40:05,291 --> 00:40:08,647
I hope you came out of
it alive! - Thanks.

276
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:12,439
How are you?

277
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:17,403
Good. And you?

278
00:40:18,411 --> 00:40:20,003
As you can see...

279
00:40:20,371 --> 00:40:22,601
I'm still single...

280
00:40:29,651 --> 00:40:32,324
Could I have a glass of water?
- Pardon.

281
00:40:33,611 --> 00:40:37,684
A glass of water for the gentleman please
and red wine for me.

282
00:40:44,211 --> 00:40:45,326
That's for you.

283
00:40:45,891 --> 00:40:48,849
That's not necessary.
- It's not worth to be mentioned.

284
00:40:49,091 --> 00:40:51,127
Thank you. Where do you live?

285
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:53,722
At "Grand hotel London".

286
00:40:54,531 --> 00:40:57,170
A nice hotel.
- It's not bad.

287
00:41:02,611 --> 00:41:03,600
Thanks.

288
00:41:10,051 --> 00:41:11,245
Where is Sibel?

289
00:41:13,851 --> 00:41:15,842
She is here. In Istanbul.

290
00:41:19,931 --> 00:41:22,286
I want to meet her. Please.

291
00:41:23,491 --> 00:41:25,129
That's not possible.
- Why?

292
00:41:26,291 --> 00:41:28,600
She has a new life.
She is happy.

293
00:41:28,891 --> 00:41:31,280
She has a friend.
She has a daughter.

294
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:33,408
She doesn't need you.

295
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:37,206
I got lost long time before.

296
00:43:08,331 --> 00:43:09,730
Do you understand?

297
00:43:40,491 --> 00:43:41,480
No.

298
00:43:44,131 --> 00:43:45,644
I am not.

299
00:44:46,251 --> 00:44:47,206
Hello?

300
00:44:49,611 --> 00:44:50,566
Hello?

301
00:44:51,451 --> 00:44:52,406
Cahit?

302
00:44:58,851 --> 00:44:59,806
Sibel?

303
00:45:02,411 --> 00:45:05,642
I can't talk at the moment.
How long are you in town?

304
00:45:06,011 --> 00:45:08,525
Until I have seen you.

305
00:45:12,371 --> 00:45:13,326
Hello?

306
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,447
There's is a call for you.

307
00:46:15,411 --> 00:46:17,686
Cem is in Zonguldak for 2 days.

308
00:46:21,931 --> 00:46:24,570
I don't come home tonight.

309
00:46:32,611 --> 00:46:34,169
Could you take care of Pamuk?

310
00:46:34,651 --> 00:46:41,170
Sweetie, are you staying with me?

311
00:46:45,331 --> 00:46:48,289
Maybe I won't be back tomorrow either.

312
00:46:49,491 --> 00:46:52,403
But you come back some time right?

313
00:47:04,651 --> 00:47:06,960
I hope you know what you do.

314
00:47:09,531 --> 00:47:12,045
No, I don't.

315
00:47:14,731 --> 00:47:17,165
I wish you all the best.

316
00:48:13,771 --> 00:48:15,363
What do you want to do?

317
00:48:17,531 --> 00:48:22,082
Do you want to stay in Istanbul?
- Me in Istanbul? Of course not.

318
00:48:23,731 --> 00:48:27,087
I go to Mersin. Where I am born.

319
00:48:30,211 --> 00:48:32,008
I don't worry.

320
00:48:33,171 --> 00:48:34,524
Good.

321
00:48:54,931 --> 00:48:57,650
Come with me?

322
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,843
Let's go back.

323
00:50:20,091 --> 00:50:21,570
It's me.

324
00:50:22,331 --> 00:50:23,844
Fine.

325
00:50:25,411 --> 00:50:27,288
What is Pamuk doing?

326
00:50:28,411 --> 00:50:30,288
I want to talk to her.

327
00:50:41,131 --> 00:50:42,803
How shall we do it?

328
00:50:46,291 --> 00:50:48,680
We meet tomorrow at the bus station.

329
00:50:51,051 --> 00:50:53,645
From there we go to Mersin.

330
00:50:56,611 --> 00:50:57,566
You,

331
00:50:58,611 --> 00:51:00,522
your daughter and I.

332
00:51:37,931 --> 00:51:40,206
When?
- 12 o'clock.

333
00:53:44,731 --> 00:53:54,686
Over there on the mountain.
There is a light fire.

334
00:54:07,091 --> 00:54:22,359
Falcons are flying over its glimmer light.

335
00:54:23,691 --> 00:54:28,162
Is everyone who is missing his darling

336
00:54:28,451 --> 00:54:33,445
insane like I am?

337
00:54:46,091 --> 00:54:54,328
I'm endlessly sad.

338
00:54:54,771 --> 00:55:01,802
May my enemies get blind.

339
00:55:03,451 --> 00:55:11,324
I got mad.

340
00:55:12,131 --> 00:55:21,085
May the mountain rejoice instead of me.
