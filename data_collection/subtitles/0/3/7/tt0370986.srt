1
00:02:20,776 --> 00:02:22,767
The summer I was 8 years old,

2
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:25,615
5 hours disappeared from my life.

3
00:02:25,816 --> 00:02:28,376
5 hours... Lost.

4
00:02:28,536 --> 00:02:30,811
Gone without a trace.

5
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:41,974
I remember sitting on
the bench at my Little League game.

6
00:02:43,416 --> 00:02:45,168
It started to rain.

7
00:02:45,416 --> 00:02:48,692
But what happened after that
remains a pitch black void.

8
00:02:49,256 --> 00:02:50,450
Brian ?

9
00:02:54,056 --> 00:02:56,854
You dork.
What the heck are you doing in there ?

10
00:03:00,176 --> 00:03:01,768
You're bleeding.

11
00:03:10,936 --> 00:03:13,689
- lt is terrible out there.
- Mom !

12
00:03:13,936 --> 00:03:16,325
Hello, sweetheart.
What happened to you ?

13
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,846
Brian got a bloody nose
hiding in the cellar.

14
00:03:19,056 --> 00:03:20,967
What were you doing down there ?

15
00:03:21,176 --> 00:03:23,292
Are you okay, sweetheart ?

16
00:03:23,456 --> 00:03:24,855
Poor little baby.

17
00:03:25,496 --> 00:03:27,930
They had me all night
in that mailroom.

18
00:03:28,136 --> 00:03:30,969
l didn't even know
it was raining.

19
00:03:31,136 --> 00:03:32,694
Hold still.

20
00:03:33,056 --> 00:03:35,650
Did another mom
give you a ride home ?

21
00:03:36,536 --> 00:03:38,652
- Goodnight.
- l hope you're happy.

22
00:03:38,856 --> 00:03:41,450
l knew he'd get hurt
playing sports.

23
00:03:42,056 --> 00:03:45,093
When l was a kid,
l wasn't a star player either.

24
00:03:45,256 --> 00:03:48,532
But at least l wasn't a quitter.

25
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,089
Sorry, dad.

26
00:03:52,736 --> 00:03:53,930
Goodnight.

27
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:59,805
l told your father
Little League was a stupid idea.

28
00:04:00,256 --> 00:04:01,814
Hold your nose.

29
00:04:05,216 --> 00:04:07,969
Mom made me
quit baseball the next day.

30
00:04:25,656 --> 00:04:28,170
This was when the nightmares began.

31
00:04:28,496 --> 00:04:30,930
And the nosebleeds.

32
00:04:31,496 --> 00:04:33,566
I wet the bed several times.

33
00:04:34,256 --> 00:04:36,531
And then there were the blackouts.

34
00:04:37,016 --> 00:04:39,371
I'd feel my eyes
roll back in my head.

35
00:04:40,296 --> 00:04:43,254
I'd crumple in the floor
like a dropped puppet.

36
00:04:47,936 --> 00:04:50,450
Darned thing's
not even a year old yet.

37
00:04:50,616 --> 00:04:54,086
Maybe it's screwed up
from all the lightning last week.

38
00:04:54,296 --> 00:04:56,093
Your father will be overjoyed.

39
00:04:56,936 --> 00:04:59,769
- What time's Dad getting home ?
- Not for another hour.

40
00:05:02,176 --> 00:05:03,291
Mom. Deborah.

41
00:05:03,816 --> 00:05:05,374
Come look.

42
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:10,812
lt's a UFO.

43
00:05:10,976 --> 00:05:12,887
lt's just a weather balloon.

44
00:05:13,736 --> 00:05:16,489
Look what it's doing to the TV.

45
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:19,772
lt's flying over the house.

46
00:05:19,976 --> 00:05:21,887
Let's go up on the roof.

47
00:05:22,136 --> 00:05:23,888
No, wait !

48
00:05:24,016 --> 00:05:25,768
Children, be careful !

49
00:05:28,736 --> 00:05:30,055
That summer,

50
00:05:30,256 --> 00:05:32,611
those were
the two things I'd never forget.

51
00:05:32,976 --> 00:05:35,649
The cramped,
stale darkness of the crawlspace.

52
00:05:36,016 --> 00:05:38,655
And, equal in power and mystery...

53
00:05:38,856 --> 00:05:42,132
..that UFO,
out there somewhere...

54
00:05:42,336 --> 00:05:44,770
..traveling across the universe.

55
00:05:48,336 --> 00:05:51,533
The summer I was 8 years old,
I came for the first time.

56
00:05:52,376 --> 00:05:55,652
I was watching my Mom going at it
with her current boyfriend,

57
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:58,051
Alfred, in my old swing set.

58
00:06:00,256 --> 00:06:03,965
Alfred was all Marlboro man,
dumb as a fucking rock,

59
00:06:04,736 --> 00:06:07,694
what I would years later,
come to call my type.

60
00:06:10,656 --> 00:06:13,853
Only stupid things
ever came out of his mouth.

61
00:06:14,056 --> 00:06:16,251
But seeing him like this,
whimpering,

62
00:06:16,456 --> 00:06:18,526
crying like a helpless animal...

63
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:22,208
I couldn't take my eyes off of him.

64
00:06:36,696 --> 00:06:39,005
I'd been masturbating for years.

65
00:06:39,216 --> 00:06:43,255
But it was that summer that
jizz first squirted out of my dick.

66
00:06:43,456 --> 00:06:45,606
Couldn't wait to show Coach.

67
00:06:45,776 --> 00:06:47,209
I should start at the beginning.

68
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,890
My Mom signed me up
for Little League.

69
00:06:50,056 --> 00:06:54,891
It was Alfred's idea, so they
could fuck without paying a sitter.

70
00:06:55,056 --> 00:06:56,614
Are you excited ?

71
00:06:58,376 --> 00:06:59,411
Coach Heider ?

72
00:07:03,376 --> 00:07:05,810
Desire sledge-hammered me.

73
00:07:06,016 --> 00:07:08,484
He looked like the lifeguards,
cowboys and firemen

74
00:07:08,696 --> 00:07:11,927
I'd seen in the ''Playgirls''
my mom kept under her bed.

75
00:07:12,096 --> 00:07:14,656
I didn't know
what to do with my feelings.

76
00:07:14,816 --> 00:07:18,252
They were like a gift
I had to open in front of a crowd.

77
00:07:18,496 --> 00:07:20,646
- Hello.
- Hello, l'm Ellen McCormick.

78
00:07:20,816 --> 00:07:22,852
And this is my son, Neil.

79
00:07:23,696 --> 00:07:25,095
Hello, Neil.

80
00:07:25,656 --> 00:07:27,647
Honey, won't you
say hello to your coach ?

81
00:07:30,976 --> 00:07:33,968
Don't worry, it takes him a while
to warm up to strangers.

82
00:07:35,976 --> 00:07:38,888
I quickly became team star player.

83
00:07:39,736 --> 00:07:44,048
Which wasn't saying much considering
the other kids were all spazzes.

84
00:07:44,936 --> 00:07:48,406
Our first game, I whacked
a triple with bases loaded.

85
00:07:48,976 --> 00:07:50,568
The crowd went fucking nuts.

86
00:07:51,416 --> 00:07:53,054
But I didn't care about that.

87
00:07:53,216 --> 00:07:56,253
All that mattered was
it made Coach proud.

88
00:07:57,336 --> 00:07:58,928
After that first victory,

89
00:07:59,096 --> 00:08:03,009
Coach called my Mom to tell her
he was taking the team to a movie.

90
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:09,326
Hey, big guy. Ready to go ?

91
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,053
Where's everybody else ?

92
00:08:13,256 --> 00:08:15,406
lt's just you and me today.

93
00:08:16,296 --> 00:08:18,332
- Really ?
- Yup.

94
00:08:19,296 --> 00:08:20,490
Cool.

95
00:08:21,416 --> 00:08:26,365
I picked ''Blood Prom'' , an R-rated
flick with cool gore and murders.

96
00:08:26,576 --> 00:08:30,455
When this annoying blonde chick
got her head chopped off, I cheered.

97
00:08:30,656 --> 00:08:34,331
Then we picked up a pizza
and headed back to Coach's.

98
00:08:35,176 --> 00:08:37,132
Coach's house was awesome.

99
00:08:37,456 --> 00:08:41,927
He had a giant TV, an Atari with
Donkey Kong, Asteroids, Frogger.

100
00:08:42,136 --> 00:08:43,933
All my favorite games.

101
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:51,207
You exploded. My turn.

102
00:08:53,536 --> 00:08:56,528
- Sure your mom's not expecting you ?
- No, she works.

103
00:08:56,696 --> 00:08:59,608
She's probably got
a date with Alfred afterwards.

104
00:08:59,776 --> 00:09:04,452
- You spend a lot of time alone.
- Yes, but l kind of like it.

105
00:09:04,616 --> 00:09:07,335
l just ride my bike and watch TV.
lt's cool.

106
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:12,372
Shit ! You made me mess up !

107
00:09:13,616 --> 00:09:14,685
Sorry !

108
00:09:15,376 --> 00:09:16,775
Hold on.

109
00:09:19,776 --> 00:09:23,291
Come here for a sec.
Bring one of those bottles.

110
00:09:28,456 --> 00:09:31,254
This might seem
a little weird at first.

111
00:09:31,456 --> 00:09:33,765
But l need to record
my team's voices,

112
00:09:33,936 --> 00:09:36,689
especially my best players.

113
00:09:38,136 --> 00:09:39,808
Okay ? Take this.

114
00:09:42,256 --> 00:09:46,090
Now just speak into it
using your normal voice.

115
00:09:46,456 --> 00:09:48,048
What should l say ?

116
00:09:48,256 --> 00:09:51,248
Whatever you like.
Start with your name.

117
00:09:54,376 --> 00:09:57,766
Now take a big sip of pop and belch.

118
00:10:00,936 --> 00:10:02,813
- Shit.
- Good.

119
00:10:02,976 --> 00:10:05,570
- Say that again.
- Shit.

120
00:10:06,456 --> 00:10:07,775
Again.

121
00:10:13,096 --> 00:10:14,609
Shit. Hell ! Damn !

122
00:10:14,776 --> 00:10:16,732
Now, look up into the camera.

123
00:10:16,976 --> 00:10:18,489
Now stick your tongue out.

124
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,773
Make a funny face.

125
00:10:23,016 --> 00:10:23,971
Good.

126
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:34,334
Open your mouth wide.

127
00:10:37,776 --> 00:10:39,175
Neil, that's perfect.

128
00:10:43,216 --> 00:10:44,410
July second.

129
00:10:44,616 --> 00:10:46,971
We had a 7:30 game
against Taco Hut.

130
00:10:47,176 --> 00:10:49,326
l know you'll kick
their butts tonight.

131
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:52,488
Do it for
your poor hard-working mom.

132
00:10:53,416 --> 00:10:56,135
- Getting a ride home with Coach ?
- Yeah.

133
00:11:06,856 --> 00:11:10,132
You're mine and l love you
and don't you ever forget it.

134
00:11:16,656 --> 00:11:19,648
Boy, were you on fire tonight !
lt's the best you've ever played !

135
00:11:19,776 --> 00:11:21,004
Thanks, Coach.

136
00:11:22,496 --> 00:11:25,056
Can we play more games tonight ?

137
00:11:25,216 --> 00:11:27,730
Sure, but let me
show you something first.

138
00:11:43,056 --> 00:11:45,286
l look stupid in this one.

139
00:11:45,856 --> 00:11:47,130
No. You look perfect.

140
00:11:47,296 --> 00:11:51,209
Your expression.
Like you're having a wonderful dream.

141
00:11:55,616 --> 00:11:58,574
Neil, l've been thinking
a lot about you this week.

142
00:11:59,776 --> 00:12:01,494
l'm hungry.

143
00:12:02,056 --> 00:12:03,535
Sure.

144
00:12:04,096 --> 00:12:07,327
You want a pizza ?
l might have something you'd like.

145
00:12:14,896 --> 00:12:18,730
- What'll it be, little buddy ?
- My mom never buys these things.

146
00:12:18,896 --> 00:12:21,615
- She says they're a waste of money.
- Let's eat then.

147
00:12:24,176 --> 00:12:26,007
Which one do you want ?

148
00:12:26,176 --> 00:12:28,371
- What are you having ?
- Corn pops.

149
00:12:28,616 --> 00:12:30,368
Then l'll have...

150
00:12:30,896 --> 00:12:32,693
Cocoa Krispies.

151
00:12:47,736 --> 00:12:49,169
Shit.

152
00:12:49,336 --> 00:12:50,849
Sorry.

153
00:13:41,216 --> 00:13:42,968
Here we go.

154
00:13:53,136 --> 00:13:54,933
l like you, Neil.

155
00:13:56,816 --> 00:13:58,613
l like you so much.

156
00:14:05,416 --> 00:14:07,691
When l really,
really like someone...

157
00:14:16,256 --> 00:14:19,009
..there's a way l show them
how l feel.

158
00:14:28,176 --> 00:14:29,495
Angel.

159
00:14:30,136 --> 00:14:33,685
There's nothing wrong
with kissing someone like this.

160
00:14:34,096 --> 00:14:37,293
Don't ever let anyone
tell you that it's wrong.

161
00:14:46,336 --> 00:14:49,726
It happened.
That's what I told myself.

162
00:14:49,896 --> 00:14:51,534
It just happened.

163
00:14:52,056 --> 00:14:55,207
And after it was over, I looked
down at the mess on the floor.

164
00:14:55,416 --> 00:14:57,850
It was like a kaleidoscope
had shattered.

165
00:14:58,136 --> 00:15:02,527
And when I swallowed, the taste
of Coach's tongue seared my mouth.

166
00:15:03,216 --> 00:15:07,004
You liked it.
lt's okay that you liked it.

167
00:15:08,096 --> 00:15:10,610
Everything's gonna be okay.

168
00:15:33,096 --> 00:15:35,007
Do you know him or something ?

169
00:15:36,736 --> 00:15:41,810
I met Wendy when I was 1 0 and
she was 1 1 and a grade ahead.

170
00:15:42,456 --> 00:15:43,571
What are you doing ?

171
00:15:44,256 --> 00:15:47,089
- Damn. No razor.
- You're insane.

172
00:15:47,296 --> 00:15:50,447
If I wasn't queer,
we would have had sloppy teenage sex

173
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:55,451
and contributing more fucked-up,
unwanted kids to society.

174
00:15:55,936 --> 00:15:59,485
But instead,
she became my soul mate.

175
00:16:00,096 --> 00:16:02,451
One true partner in crime.

176
00:16:03,296 --> 00:16:05,526
Let's kidnap him.

177
00:16:06,776 --> 00:16:09,574
His mom says
we're supposed to take him home.

178
00:16:11,536 --> 00:16:15,085
- Where are you taking me ?
- A house with lots of candy.

179
00:16:16,096 --> 00:16:17,085
Goody.

180
00:16:19,136 --> 00:16:21,286
Beware !

181
00:16:26,136 --> 00:16:29,731
These are the eyes
of the Axe Murderer's victims.

182
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:37,849
- Come on, Satan.
- Hurry up, chicken.

183
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:42,611
Never much cared for Halloween,
but this particular year...

184
00:16:42,816 --> 00:16:46,695
...I couldn't shake the feeling
something horrible was gonna happen.

185
00:16:46,856 --> 00:16:49,051
And there was nothing
I could do to stop it.

186
00:16:49,256 --> 00:16:51,565
Wait outside for me.
l'll be done in a minute.

187
00:16:54,536 --> 00:16:56,447
You hold him
while l get something.

188
00:16:56,616 --> 00:16:59,369
- What are we doing ?
- Having fun.

189
00:17:11,256 --> 00:17:14,487
- What's the matter, ''Satan'' ?
- What did you say, punk ?

190
00:17:17,616 --> 00:17:19,049
Loser !

191
00:17:20,896 --> 00:17:22,329
Loser !

192
00:17:36,856 --> 00:17:38,289
Brian ?

193
00:17:44,296 --> 00:17:46,491
I thought that was you.

194
00:17:51,536 --> 00:17:52,935
Lie down.

195
00:17:53,136 --> 00:17:55,286
Lie down, retard.

196
00:17:55,856 --> 00:17:57,608
- What are you doing ?
- Shut up !

197
00:17:57,816 --> 00:17:59,568
Shut up, or we'll kill you.

198
00:18:00,056 --> 00:18:01,808
Point the beam over here.

199
00:18:02,176 --> 00:18:03,450
Open your mouth.

200
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,647
l said open your mouth.

201
00:18:06,896 --> 00:18:11,174
Keep these in your fucking mouth.
Do what we say or l'll kill you.

202
00:18:11,376 --> 00:18:12,775
l swear.

203
00:18:13,376 --> 00:18:15,651
Give me the matches.

204
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:17,932
Give me the damned matches.

205
00:18:32,816 --> 00:18:34,772
Shine the flashlight on him.

206
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,247
Neil, he's going to tattle !

207
00:18:39,216 --> 00:18:42,731
Don't worry. There are things
we can do to get him on our side.

208
00:18:44,216 --> 00:18:46,650
That's it.
Just lay still for a minute.

209
00:18:46,856 --> 00:18:48,528
You're my little green buddy

210
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:50,931
and there's this cool thing
to show you.

211
00:18:52,656 --> 00:18:55,045
When l was little,
a man used to do this to me.

212
00:18:55,216 --> 00:18:57,252
You're really gonna like it.

213
00:18:57,416 --> 00:18:59,805
There. That's it. That's my boy.

214
00:19:01,576 --> 00:19:04,648
Wendy never looked at me
quite the same after that night.

215
00:19:04,816 --> 00:19:08,206
Sharing this part of myself
I'd never shown anyone else...

216
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,053
I knew we'd be bound together.
Forever.

217
00:19:16,096 --> 00:19:20,931
I woke up not knowing where I was
or what had happened to me.

218
00:19:21,616 --> 00:19:25,575
Deborah said
I'd been missing for over an hour.

219
00:19:25,776 --> 00:19:27,653
But I couldn't remember a thing.

220
00:19:27,816 --> 00:19:30,569
But I knew it was
linked to the other time,

221
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:32,931
when I woke up in the cellar.

222
00:19:33,096 --> 00:19:36,088
And I also knew
no matter how long it took...

223
00:19:36,456 --> 00:19:38,765
..I had to find out what happened.

224
00:19:38,936 --> 00:19:41,450
I had to find
an answer to the mystery.

225
00:19:44,536 --> 00:19:48,529
When I was 1 5, I overheard kids
at school talking about a place.

226
00:19:48,936 --> 00:19:52,929
A place you could find even in
a hicktown like Hutchinson.

227
00:20:07,976 --> 00:20:09,773
Bingo...

228
00:20:38,336 --> 00:20:39,564
Here we go.

229
00:20:51,296 --> 00:20:52,615
How's it going ?

230
00:20:53,136 --> 00:20:54,615
Okay.

231
00:20:55,336 --> 00:20:56,815
l'm Charlie.

232
00:20:59,096 --> 00:21:00,848
Wanna go for a ride ?

233
00:21:03,656 --> 00:21:04,850
Sure.

234
00:21:06,056 --> 00:21:07,853
You got cash ?

235
00:21:08,056 --> 00:21:10,889
l'll pay 50, no higher.

236
00:21:11,496 --> 00:21:13,964
You've got to be careful out here.

237
00:21:14,176 --> 00:21:16,292
The cops patrol this whole area

238
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:18,930
and they know what's up.

239
00:21:19,136 --> 00:21:21,286
l'm in Hutchinson on business.

240
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:24,886
l supply snack foods
to the local markets.

241
00:21:25,456 --> 00:21:27,253
Go ahead.
Take whatever you want.

242
00:21:34,776 --> 00:21:36,334
Hungry ?

243
00:21:45,376 --> 00:21:47,526
We've only got an hour,

244
00:21:48,096 --> 00:21:50,371
so we'd better get busy.

245
00:21:55,616 --> 00:21:56,765
Wait.

246
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,565
Let me.

247
00:22:08,296 --> 00:22:09,809
Beautiful.

248
00:22:15,056 --> 00:22:17,365
So, what do you like to do ?

249
00:22:19,536 --> 00:22:21,367
Tell me what you want me to do.

250
00:22:22,376 --> 00:22:24,014
Whatever.

251
00:22:28,696 --> 00:22:31,494
You like older guys ? Tell me.

252
00:22:32,856 --> 00:22:34,289
Yeah.

253
00:22:41,056 --> 00:22:42,967
That feels nice.

254
00:22:46,976 --> 00:22:49,615
You are such a beautiful...

255
00:22:50,256 --> 00:22:52,008
..beautiful boy.

256
00:23:28,296 --> 00:23:29,968
l'm gonna come.

257
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,454
l'm gonna come.

258
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:23,294
l know what you're thinking.
That wasn't safe.

259
00:24:23,496 --> 00:24:25,327
But we're in Kansas, thank God,

260
00:24:25,536 --> 00:24:27,811
not some big city
full of diseases.

261
00:24:29,856 --> 00:24:32,893
Plus, you're only a kid.

262
00:24:51,216 --> 00:24:53,605
Maniac. You scared me !

263
00:24:53,816 --> 00:24:55,329
Thanks for meeting me.

264
00:24:55,496 --> 00:24:58,852
This better be good.
My mom'll kill me if she finds out.

265
00:24:59,016 --> 00:25:00,688
l have something l wanna show you.

266
00:25:17,936 --> 00:25:19,847
FRlDAYS & SATURDAYS 3 TO 4
YOUNG AND WlLLlNG

267
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:21,210
Yeah. So ?

268
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:24,335
That's me.

269
00:25:29,856 --> 00:25:31,653
You're such a liar.

270
00:25:32,936 --> 00:25:34,767
l don't believe you.

271
00:25:35,216 --> 00:25:37,446
- l'll prove it.
- Okay. How ?

272
00:25:37,656 --> 00:25:39,294
Oh, my God, what're you...

273
00:25:39,496 --> 00:25:41,612
Put that back in your pants,
exhibitionist.

274
00:25:41,816 --> 00:25:43,647
- Look.
- No way, pervert.

275
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:46,131
Look what the guy did to me.

276
00:25:54,016 --> 00:25:55,415
Are those bruises ?

277
00:25:55,616 --> 00:25:58,688
Fucker gnawed on my dick
like it was a candy cane !

278
00:25:58,856 --> 00:26:01,086
Didn't know he hurt me
till l blew my load.

279
00:26:01,256 --> 00:26:03,053
Well, you better watch out.

280
00:26:03,256 --> 00:26:06,168
Next time someone
might chomp the whole thing off.

281
00:26:07,016 --> 00:26:08,415
Seriously.

282
00:26:08,576 --> 00:26:13,127
Even Hutchinson has freaks.
You could end up dead.

283
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:15,048
Okay, ''Mom''.

284
00:26:21,576 --> 00:26:23,965
l wish there was
a movie showing right now.

285
00:26:24,256 --> 00:26:25,928
Me too.

286
00:26:26,296 --> 00:26:30,574
A film about our lives.
Everything that's happened so far.

287
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:35,285
And the last scene
would just be us standing right here.

288
00:26:35,536 --> 00:26:37,208
Just you and me.

289
00:26:40,376 --> 00:26:41,491
Yeah.

290
00:26:56,976 --> 00:26:59,126
l hear something.

291
00:27:03,776 --> 00:27:05,846
lt's the voice of God.

292
00:27:19,336 --> 00:27:21,292
l hear him.

293
00:27:27,216 --> 00:27:28,774
l hear him.

294
00:27:45,536 --> 00:27:46,525
Mom !

295
00:27:46,736 --> 00:27:49,375
- lt's about to begin.
- Alright, l'm coming.

296
00:27:50,936 --> 00:27:54,212
- VCR on ?
- l checked it twice.

297
00:27:54,376 --> 00:27:56,094
lt's probably going to be silly.

298
00:27:56,296 --> 00:27:58,252
The commercial showed
an old man...

299
00:27:58,416 --> 00:28:02,125
..claiming aliens beamed him up
right out of his bathtub.

300
00:28:03,576 --> 00:28:07,728
lf you're going to make fun,
l'll just watch it by myself.

301
00:28:08,856 --> 00:28:09,845
lt's starting.

302
00:28:10,056 --> 00:28:12,445
Tonight on ''World Of Mystery'',

303
00:28:12,656 --> 00:28:15,887
..we investigate
the terrifying world of UFOs.

304
00:28:16,056 --> 00:28:20,129
Is it mass hysteria
or something all too real ?

305
00:28:20,336 --> 00:28:22,725
They kept me prisoner for hours.

306
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:28,210
They examined me like
I was a frog in biology class.

307
00:28:28,656 --> 00:28:32,012
And then they stuck a probe
in my stomach.

308
00:28:32,336 --> 00:28:35,408
I still got the scar here
to prove it.

309
00:28:36,776 --> 00:28:37,606
Look at that.

310
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:41,604
I always got scared anytime
I watched movies about UFOs.

311
00:28:41,816 --> 00:28:43,568
Even ''E. T. '' scared me.

312
00:28:43,976 --> 00:28:47,810
Poor thing.
She looks so homely and sad.

313
00:28:48,016 --> 00:28:52,134
Avalyn Friesen lives in
the ordinary town of Inman, Kansas.

314
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,807
lnman ? That's only 30 miles away.

315
00:28:57,016 --> 00:28:59,928
32 years old, she is unmarried.

316
00:29:00,136 --> 00:29:02,604
Lives with her father
and works as a secretary.

317
00:29:02,816 --> 00:29:05,455
But there is something
unusual about Avalyn.

318
00:29:05,656 --> 00:29:07,408
For as long as she can remember,

319
00:29:07,616 --> 00:29:10,574
things have happened to her,
things she cannot explain.

320
00:29:10,736 --> 00:29:13,887
I'd heard about people
who've experienced missing time.

321
00:29:14,096 --> 00:29:17,532
Whole chunks of their lives
they couldn't account for.

322
00:29:17,736 --> 00:29:19,772
Under hypnotic regression,

323
00:29:19,976 --> 00:29:23,093
I learned I'd been abducted
more than 20 times.

324
00:29:23,376 --> 00:29:24,968
- Oh, please !
- Quiet.

325
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:26,973
The first time I was 6.

326
00:29:27,176 --> 00:29:31,010
I was on my way home from
a picnic with my grandparents.

327
00:29:31,176 --> 00:29:34,486
It was dark and we got lost,
driving down a dirt road.

328
00:29:34,696 --> 00:29:37,574
Grandpa lost control
and we went into a ditch.

329
00:29:37,736 --> 00:29:40,125
There was this blinding white light.

330
00:29:40,496 --> 00:29:44,205
But the aliens weren't interested
in my grandparents.

331
00:29:44,376 --> 00:29:48,972
They floated me up out of the car
using a gravitational ray.

332
00:29:51,536 --> 00:29:53,492
That's it. l've had enough.

333
00:29:53,696 --> 00:29:55,732
l'm gonna get some ice cream.
Want some ?

334
00:29:55,896 --> 00:29:57,215
No, thanks.

335
00:29:57,416 --> 00:30:00,374
I remember lying on a table.
It was cold,

336
00:30:00,536 --> 00:30:01,935
smooth and shiny.

337
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:05,452
The aliens surrounded me.
They were bald.

338
00:30:05,616 --> 00:30:08,847
With marshmallowy heads
and tiny arms.

339
00:30:09,056 --> 00:30:11,616
But the worst part was their eyes.

340
00:30:11,816 --> 00:30:13,807
The only way I can describe them

341
00:30:13,976 --> 00:30:17,332
is big, black diamonds,
all liquidy and jelly-ish.

342
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:44,815
l'm finally getting out
of this fucking nowhere town !

343
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:48,088
You better let me know
the second you're settled.

344
00:30:48,696 --> 00:30:50,254
Or else.

345
00:30:50,576 --> 00:30:53,807
You better come. Or else.

346
00:30:54,016 --> 00:30:56,405
New York City. You're so lucky !

347
00:31:06,816 --> 00:31:08,329
Hey, assface.

348
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:10,566
What're you gawking at ?

349
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:17,565
Faggots !

350
00:31:17,736 --> 00:31:18,725
Shit, go, go, go !

351
00:31:23,216 --> 00:31:24,729
Fuck you !

352
00:31:39,256 --> 00:31:42,646
Remember the guy l told you ?
White Camaro ?

353
00:31:42,856 --> 00:31:44,608
That's him. Parked by those trees.

354
00:31:44,816 --> 00:31:48,650
l've fucked every john in this park.
Except for White Camaro.

355
00:31:49,176 --> 00:31:51,326
So it's time for you two
to get lost.

356
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:53,965
Stop scaring my business away.

357
00:31:54,456 --> 00:31:56,287
You want us
to pick you up later ?

358
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:59,129
lf you want.
l'll be done by 7.

359
00:31:59,416 --> 00:32:00,929
We'll meet you.

360
00:32:01,096 --> 00:32:03,769
l gotta get home
and start packing.

361
00:32:03,976 --> 00:32:05,409
Alright. Call me tonight.

362
00:32:05,616 --> 00:32:07,288
See you later.

363
00:32:14,936 --> 00:32:18,895
- You'd better be careful.
- Of what ?

364
00:32:19,496 --> 00:32:22,169
l'm serious,
you're not in Modesto anymore.

365
00:32:22,816 --> 00:32:25,091
l see the way you look at him.

366
00:32:25,536 --> 00:32:27,492
He's so beautiful.

367
00:32:28,256 --> 00:32:31,532
l can't help it.
He's like a god.

368
00:32:32,456 --> 00:32:36,210
You don't have to tell me,
l was infatuated with him too once.

369
00:32:37,576 --> 00:32:42,127
But l know all Neil's secrets and
there's shit you don't want to know.

370
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:47,653
Once l'm gone, you'll be all Neil has
and you have to understand one thing.

371
00:32:47,856 --> 00:32:49,608
Where normal people have a heart,

372
00:32:49,816 --> 00:32:52,569
Neil McCormick's has
a bottomless black hole.

373
00:32:52,736 --> 00:32:57,014
And if you don't watch out,
you can fall in and get lost forever.

374
00:33:29,496 --> 00:33:32,294
- Brian, you home ?
- Yeah, Mom. ln here.

375
00:33:41,296 --> 00:33:42,968
No class today ?

376
00:33:43,336 --> 00:33:45,896
l've got English Comp
discussion group at 7:30.

377
00:33:46,816 --> 00:33:49,808
You have mail.
Looks like one from your sister.

378
00:33:50,016 --> 00:33:52,246
And one from A. Friesen ?

379
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:56,971
l can't believe she wrote me back.

380
00:33:57,136 --> 00:34:00,287
- Who ?
- Avalyn Friesen. The woman on TV.

381
00:34:00,816 --> 00:34:03,933
She didn't have to dump
a whole gallon of perfume on it.

382
00:34:05,976 --> 00:34:07,887
What did she say ?

383
00:34:08,416 --> 00:34:10,884
She wants me
to visit her in lnman.

384
00:34:33,256 --> 00:34:35,645
Thanks for the ride, Preston.

385
00:34:37,456 --> 00:34:38,855
Later.

386
00:34:44,216 --> 00:34:46,366
You just missed it, sweetie.

387
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:49,807
This little old lady
just won both showcases.

388
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,646
- What did she get ?
- She got a trip to Scotland...

389
00:34:56,336 --> 00:34:59,408
A beautiful living room set.
A brand new car.

390
00:35:01,136 --> 00:35:04,811
l can't remember the name of it
but it cost over 27 grand.

391
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,772
Are you wearing cologne ?

392
00:35:11,816 --> 00:35:13,852
ls work okay ?

393
00:35:14,376 --> 00:35:16,014
lt's the pits.

394
00:35:17,256 --> 00:35:20,248
When is our ship
gonna come in, baby ?

395
00:35:20,456 --> 00:35:22,287
Soon, Ma.

396
00:35:23,536 --> 00:35:25,094
Soon.

397
00:35:29,656 --> 00:35:31,567
Oh, Neil, don't forget.

398
00:35:31,816 --> 00:35:34,808
Tomorrow's my date.
That hot ltalian.

399
00:35:35,016 --> 00:35:37,484
The guy who always
comes through my checkout lane.

400
00:35:37,696 --> 00:35:40,768
l'll be at work.
The last tournament of the season.

401
00:35:41,336 --> 00:35:42,894
Vincenzo.

402
00:36:30,896 --> 00:36:32,215
Patches ! Patches, down.

403
00:36:32,656 --> 00:36:34,374
Sorry, she gets a little excited.

404
00:36:34,576 --> 00:36:37,090
Hi, you must be Brian.
l'm Avalyn, obviously.

405
00:36:37,856 --> 00:36:40,450
Dad ? lt's okay, Daddy.

406
00:36:40,656 --> 00:36:43,250
lt's that young man
l was telling you about.

407
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:47,967
Don't mind him.
He's just a little wary of strangers.

408
00:36:48,376 --> 00:36:51,129
l'm so glad you're here. Come on.

409
00:36:53,296 --> 00:36:56,368
lt isn't showy, but it's home.
Here, have a seat.

410
00:36:57,056 --> 00:37:00,332
l was in the middle of lunch.
l hope you don't mind.

411
00:37:00,496 --> 00:37:03,010
No, go ahead. l ate earlier.

412
00:37:03,336 --> 00:37:04,849
So, you saw the show ?

413
00:37:05,656 --> 00:37:08,966
Several times,
l videotaped it.

414
00:37:09,336 --> 00:37:13,090
They left some stuff out, but
they got the major points across.

415
00:37:14,776 --> 00:37:17,165
l think l was taken too.

416
00:37:17,376 --> 00:37:19,765
You mentioned that in your letter.

417
00:37:19,976 --> 00:37:23,252
You're where l was a few years ago,
just starting to remember.

418
00:37:23,456 --> 00:37:27,369
There are many of us and
we need to know what happened.

419
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:31,046
So you think
that's what happened to me.

420
00:37:31,256 --> 00:37:33,724
Considering
about the missing time and...

421
00:37:33,936 --> 00:37:35,688
l'm sure of it.

422
00:37:37,896 --> 00:37:39,727
Feel like going on a walk ?

423
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:42,209
What's that you're carrying ?

424
00:37:42,416 --> 00:37:44,805
lt's a Dream Journal.

425
00:37:45,536 --> 00:37:47,766
l keep a log of all my dreams.

426
00:37:47,976 --> 00:37:50,854
Whatever bits and pieces
l can recall at least.

427
00:37:51,296 --> 00:37:54,094
l feel like
it's slowly helping me remember.

428
00:37:54,256 --> 00:37:55,848
That's a really good idea.

429
00:37:56,016 --> 00:37:58,735
Your subconscious is where
all your memories are buried.

430
00:37:58,896 --> 00:38:00,852
For you and me
and people like us

431
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:04,844
almost every single thing we do
stems from our being abducted.

432
00:38:05,016 --> 00:38:09,692
l want to show you something
they wouldn't allow on TV.

433
00:38:11,216 --> 00:38:14,606
l've been tagged.
Part of their experiments.

434
00:38:14,776 --> 00:38:15,765
Touch it.

435
00:38:19,096 --> 00:38:21,485
When l was taken,
my leg was bleeding,

436
00:38:21,656 --> 00:38:24,090
but l didn't remember being cut.

437
00:38:24,296 --> 00:38:26,048
Under hypnosis l discovered

438
00:38:26,256 --> 00:38:29,965
that's where
they implanted the tracking device.

439
00:38:30,176 --> 00:38:32,053
Now everything l do, they know.

440
00:38:32,256 --> 00:38:35,726
ln fact, l wouldn't be surprised
if they were spying on us right now.

441
00:38:35,936 --> 00:38:39,929
When l was found that night,
my nose was bleeding.

442
00:38:40,976 --> 00:38:44,935
The old up-the-nose trick,
so the scar can't be seen.

443
00:38:47,136 --> 00:38:49,206
Don't forget to write.

444
00:38:51,336 --> 00:38:54,214
Don't you forget what l told you.

445
00:38:58,696 --> 00:39:01,688
You better come see me soon, asshole.

446
00:39:02,216 --> 00:39:03,695
l will.

447
00:39:06,896 --> 00:39:08,329
l will.

448
00:39:37,376 --> 00:39:39,332
Stay out of trouble, you two.

449
00:39:43,816 --> 00:39:45,090
Bye.

450
00:39:53,376 --> 00:39:56,095
l can't believe it's so late.
My mom's gonna worry.

451
00:39:56,296 --> 00:39:57,888
You still live with your mom ?

452
00:39:58,416 --> 00:40:00,691
My dad moved out 7 years ago.

453
00:40:00,896 --> 00:40:04,775
- l don't see him much.
- Read me one of your dreams.

454
00:40:05,056 --> 00:40:09,129
l just scribble
them out in the middle of the night.

455
00:40:09,336 --> 00:40:13,090
- Sometimes l can barely read them.
- That's okay.

456
00:40:22,456 --> 00:40:24,686
This is from 2 nights ago.

457
00:40:26,936 --> 00:40:28,813
''There's a blue light.

458
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:32,008
l'm in my Little League uniform

459
00:40:32,216 --> 00:40:34,446
and a tall alien
is hovering over me.

460
00:40:35,376 --> 00:40:37,492
Someone else is with me.

461
00:40:37,696 --> 00:40:39,175
Another boy.

462
00:40:39,376 --> 00:40:41,014
Also in uniform.

463
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:43,015
A Panther ?''

464
00:40:44,496 --> 00:40:47,329
That was the name
of my baseball team.

465
00:40:49,136 --> 00:40:50,728
Let's see...

466
00:40:52,536 --> 00:40:55,289
''The alien has big black eyes.

467
00:40:56,176 --> 00:40:57,928
He's touching my face.

468
00:40:59,856 --> 00:41:02,165
l want to cry out for help, but...

469
00:41:04,696 --> 00:41:06,334
..l can't.''

470
00:41:09,296 --> 00:41:11,366
You're on your way
to uncovering the truth.

471
00:41:11,776 --> 00:41:13,812
Think of yourself as a detective.

472
00:41:14,016 --> 00:41:16,610
Concentrate on the other boy
in your dreams,

473
00:41:16,776 --> 00:41:20,132
he could help you find
the answers you're looking for.

474
00:41:22,376 --> 00:41:24,844
Two outs.
Third baseman Jackson up

475
00:41:25,056 --> 00:41:26,648
with Hinton on deck.

476
00:41:28,056 --> 00:41:31,128
Jesus. Check out that Jackson.
Hubba hubba.

477
00:41:31,936 --> 00:41:34,006
Are you joking ?

478
00:41:35,056 --> 00:41:37,047
l'd fuck him for free.

479
00:41:39,096 --> 00:41:42,691
Please return all foul balls
to press box, thank you.

480
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:45,372
You don't think Jackson's hot ?

481
00:41:45,856 --> 00:41:48,893
Dude, he's fat and bald !

482
00:41:50,176 --> 00:41:52,167
Different folks,
different strokes.

483
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:54,651
My Daddy hit this.

484
00:41:56,136 --> 00:41:58,445
Well, come here. Collect your prize.

485
00:41:59,736 --> 00:42:01,215
Thank you so much.

486
00:42:01,416 --> 00:42:02,644
One second.

487
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,216
What will it be, big guy ?
Cash or bubbles ?

488
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:12,408
You can't decide.
Alright, come on, hold out your hand.

489
00:42:17,056 --> 00:42:19,365
- Thanks !
- You're welcome.

490
00:42:20,056 --> 00:42:21,205
See you later.

491
00:42:23,696 --> 00:42:27,052
What ? When kids do good,
you gotta reward them.

492
00:42:27,256 --> 00:42:28,928
Christ, it's Hinton,

493
00:42:29,136 --> 00:42:31,696
a.k.a. Ass of the Gods.

494
00:42:33,376 --> 00:42:35,810
l am so fucking wasted !

495
00:42:37,176 --> 00:42:38,495
Oh, shit !

496
00:42:39,136 --> 00:42:40,933
Where's your mom ?

497
00:42:41,136 --> 00:42:44,890
She's probably out with
her new boyfriend, Vincenzo.

498
00:42:48,736 --> 00:42:51,045
l've got a wicked headache.

499
00:42:52,376 --> 00:42:54,765
- Do you have any pot ?
- Yeah. Come on.

500
00:43:03,936 --> 00:43:05,130
Here.

501
00:43:05,336 --> 00:43:06,849
Knock yourself out.

502
00:43:10,296 --> 00:43:13,811
There's a porno in the VCR
if you wanna jack off.

503
00:43:14,416 --> 00:43:15,644
Thanks.

504
00:43:16,816 --> 00:43:18,613
You got a lighter ?

505
00:43:19,496 --> 00:43:21,054
Yeah. Here.

506
00:45:09,696 --> 00:45:12,893
- You like that ?
- It tickles a little.

507
00:45:13,216 --> 00:45:15,525
That feels good, doesn't it, Neil ?

508
00:45:16,856 --> 00:45:21,008
Should we put the blanket
over our heads like last time ?

509
00:45:22,096 --> 00:45:23,973
Here we go.

510
00:45:29,816 --> 00:45:31,932
Find what you were looking for ?

511
00:45:33,056 --> 00:45:36,446
- Yeah. Thanks a lot.
- Glad l could help out.

512
00:45:36,656 --> 00:45:39,489
l used to write for
my school paper too.

513
00:45:39,896 --> 00:45:42,968
This will really make
a big difference to my article.

514
00:45:43,136 --> 00:45:46,492
- Maybe you'll win a Pulitzer Prize.
- Maybe.

515
00:45:46,656 --> 00:45:49,124
Just let me know if
there's anything else you need.

516
00:45:49,296 --> 00:45:51,014
Thanks so much.

517
00:46:02,096 --> 00:46:03,290
You done already ?

518
00:46:03,496 --> 00:46:05,532
l'm on kind of a tight deadline.

519
00:46:05,736 --> 00:46:07,374
Well, good luck.

520
00:46:08,096 --> 00:46:11,725
That's two outs.
Garfield the batter, Heim on deck.

521
00:46:16,616 --> 00:46:18,971
Scoot your chair back
a little further.

522
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:21,294
That's better.

523
00:46:32,216 --> 00:46:33,934
Wait. Hold on a sec.

524
00:46:34,616 --> 00:46:38,370
The score is
Hutchinson First National Bank, 3...

525
00:46:38,536 --> 00:46:41,004
Wichita Coleman Industries, 0.

526
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,615
Okay. Go on.

527
00:46:47,816 --> 00:46:49,932
- Where have you been ?
- Sorry.

528
00:46:50,136 --> 00:46:53,048
l should've called.
l didn't realize the time.

529
00:46:53,216 --> 00:46:56,652
- Well, your dinner's cold as ice.
- That's okay.

530
00:46:58,136 --> 00:47:01,924
Brian, what's going on ?
You've been acting so strangely.

531
00:47:02,096 --> 00:47:05,054
- Disappearing for hours.
- lt's just school, Mom.

532
00:47:05,216 --> 00:47:08,606
- College is different.
- Did you ever call your father back ?

533
00:47:09,216 --> 00:47:11,332
l've been busy.

534
00:47:11,656 --> 00:47:13,647
l'll get it.
You finish your dinner.

535
00:47:17,216 --> 00:47:19,207
He's eating his supper right now.

536
00:47:19,416 --> 00:47:21,646
- Who is it ?
- lt's that UFO woman.

537
00:47:22,776 --> 00:47:24,653
l'll get it in the hall.

538
00:47:26,776 --> 00:47:27,891
Got it.

539
00:47:31,216 --> 00:47:32,888
l was just going to call you.

540
00:47:33,056 --> 00:47:34,887
l found a photo of the boy.

541
00:47:35,056 --> 00:47:36,250
The one from my dreams.

542
00:47:36,456 --> 00:47:38,651
That's amazing.
What are you doing right now ?

543
00:47:39,416 --> 00:47:40,644
Nothing.

544
00:47:40,816 --> 00:47:44,013
l need to show you something.
Can you come out here ?

545
00:47:44,216 --> 00:47:45,535
Sure.

546
00:47:47,456 --> 00:47:50,766
- Hi, honey. How was work ?
- Fuck you.

547
00:48:00,576 --> 00:48:04,967
l'm so fucking sick of this stinking
little buttcrack of a town !

548
00:48:20,616 --> 00:48:23,210
Patches, shhh, quiet !
You'll wake Daddy.

549
00:48:23,976 --> 00:48:26,934
- Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

550
00:48:27,416 --> 00:48:29,930
l stole this from
the Chamber of Commerce.

551
00:48:30,616 --> 00:48:33,084
That's him.
The boy from my dreams.

552
00:48:33,296 --> 00:48:37,084
Look at his face.
You can tell he knows something.

553
00:48:39,776 --> 00:48:41,448
What are you doing ?

554
00:48:49,736 --> 00:48:53,092
Start looking for him tomorrow.
Maybe he still lives in Hutchinson.

555
00:48:53,256 --> 00:48:57,169
l have to show you something
only you would understand.

556
00:48:59,296 --> 00:49:03,653
l've fucked every single guy and
his ugly uncle in this podunk town.

557
00:49:04,456 --> 00:49:05,855
Twice.

558
00:49:13,416 --> 00:49:14,735
You want one ?

559
00:49:15,656 --> 00:49:17,567
One of us has to drive.

560
00:49:20,696 --> 00:49:22,129
l got a postcard from Wendy.

561
00:49:22,336 --> 00:49:26,090
l think she's mad at me
because l owe her 3 letters.

562
00:49:26,256 --> 00:49:30,010
Yeah, her last P.S. is
''Tell Fuckface to write me.''

563
00:49:30,176 --> 00:49:32,167
So you wanna hear what she says ?

564
00:49:35,416 --> 00:49:39,329
''Hey ass. So New York is insane
and crazy in the best possible way.''

565
00:49:39,536 --> 00:49:40,651
Pardon me.

566
00:49:41,896 --> 00:49:43,614
Can we help you ?

567
00:49:43,776 --> 00:49:45,653
l was wondering if
l might buy you boys a drink.

568
00:49:46,656 --> 00:49:48,248
Fuck off.

569
00:49:49,896 --> 00:49:52,888
You heard me, fag. Fuck... off.

570
00:49:53,376 --> 00:49:55,526
Stuck-up little pricks.

571
00:49:55,936 --> 00:49:57,164
Harsh.

572
00:49:57,376 --> 00:49:59,412
Wasn't he kinda your type ?

573
00:49:59,616 --> 00:50:02,972
No, l hate when they look like Tarzan
and sound like Jane.

574
00:50:03,256 --> 00:50:05,486
Let's get out of this shithole.

575
00:50:05,656 --> 00:50:07,612
But we just got here ?

576
00:50:11,256 --> 00:50:13,133
Patches, get away from there !

577
00:50:16,016 --> 00:50:19,565
Farmers have been finding mutilated
cattle around here for years.

578
00:50:19,736 --> 00:50:23,411
l told ''World of Mystery'',
but they conveniently edited it out.

579
00:50:23,616 --> 00:50:28,167
Dad says it's ''Satan worshipers''
going around chopping up cows.

580
00:50:29,256 --> 00:50:31,053
Come here. Let me see your hand.

581
00:50:33,136 --> 00:50:34,615
Feel that ?

582
00:50:34,976 --> 00:50:37,444
Sex organs. They're gone.

583
00:50:38,376 --> 00:50:42,494
The aliens experiment on cows because
the poor things are so defenseless.

584
00:50:42,696 --> 00:50:44,652
Us, on the other hand,
they can't kill us.

585
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:47,495
They just leave behind
hidden memories.

586
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:49,812
Which in a way is almost worse.

587
00:50:50,016 --> 00:50:53,565
Notice anything else strange ?
There's no blood.

588
00:50:53,776 --> 00:50:55,767
They took that, too.

589
00:51:16,696 --> 00:51:17,685
Here we go.

590
00:51:17,856 --> 00:51:19,653
Oh, my God. Brian !

591
00:51:19,856 --> 00:51:21,653
Tell him you like it.

592
00:51:24,576 --> 00:51:26,168
Are you okay ?

593
00:51:26,336 --> 00:51:27,485
Oh, God.

594
00:51:30,656 --> 00:51:32,806
Neil. What are you doing ?

595
00:51:34,736 --> 00:51:37,125
Come on. lt's 2:30 in the morning.

596
00:51:38,296 --> 00:51:40,810
You called me your fucking...

597
00:51:42,136 --> 00:51:43,285
..angel.

598
00:51:46,376 --> 00:51:48,412
Wendy's going to meet you
at the station ?

599
00:51:48,576 --> 00:51:50,612
l don't want you getting lost
in that crazy city.

600
00:51:50,776 --> 00:51:54,132
- You don't have to worry, okay ?
- Call me the minute you arrive.

601
00:51:54,296 --> 00:51:56,287
Promise me, Neil.

602
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:05,211
We should've at least gotten you
a decent hair cut.

603
00:52:07,256 --> 00:52:08,928
l gotta take a piss.

604
00:52:11,656 --> 00:52:13,612
We'll be right back.

605
00:52:16,456 --> 00:52:18,333
- What's the matter ?
- l don't know.

606
00:52:18,536 --> 00:52:22,211
My fucking dick itches
like motherfucking fuck !

607
00:52:22,736 --> 00:52:24,454
What do you want me
to do about it ?

608
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:26,453
Just look down there.

609
00:52:27,336 --> 00:52:28,564
Preston, come on,
help me out here.

610
00:52:31,456 --> 00:52:32,525
What's wrong with me ?

611
00:52:34,376 --> 00:52:37,334
Dude. You've got crabs.

612
00:52:41,416 --> 00:52:43,008
l mean, it's no big, man.

613
00:52:43,176 --> 00:52:46,486
You just go to the drug store
and get this stuff called ''Rid''.

614
00:52:48,456 --> 00:52:50,367
You'd better be playing safe.

615
00:52:50,576 --> 00:52:52,532
l stay in control.

616
00:52:53,376 --> 00:52:55,367
Honey, your bus is boarding.

617
00:52:55,736 --> 00:52:56,964
Alright.

618
00:53:04,096 --> 00:53:05,814
My baby.

619
00:53:06,576 --> 00:53:08,009
You're all grown up.

620
00:53:12,336 --> 00:53:14,167
You'll be careful ?

621
00:53:14,896 --> 00:53:15,885
Yeah, l will.

622
00:53:21,736 --> 00:53:25,012
You're mine and l love you.
Don't you ever forget it.

623
00:53:46,656 --> 00:53:48,851
Come on. l'll buy you Dairy Queen.

624
00:53:49,056 --> 00:53:51,126
So what now that Neil's gone ?

625
00:53:51,696 --> 00:53:55,371
- l'll kill myself.
- Eric, that is not funny.

626
00:53:55,736 --> 00:53:57,931
Well, l start
Community College next week.

627
00:53:58,376 --> 00:54:00,207
Really ? That's so wonderful.

628
00:54:00,416 --> 00:54:02,327
Pathetic is more like it.

629
00:54:02,576 --> 00:54:06,285
You can always come over
even without Neil around.

630
00:54:07,056 --> 00:54:09,775
Thanks, Mrs. M.
l may just take you up on that.

631
00:54:09,976 --> 00:54:11,375
You better.

632
00:54:15,296 --> 00:54:16,854
Who the hell is that ?

633
00:54:17,656 --> 00:54:20,124
lncognito Boy Scout ?

634
00:54:25,976 --> 00:54:27,329
Can l help you ?

635
00:54:28,136 --> 00:54:31,048
- ls this your house ?
- Yes.

636
00:54:32,136 --> 00:54:35,526
Sorry to bother you, l got
your address out of the phonebook.

637
00:54:36,136 --> 00:54:40,687
l've been checking every McCormick in
Hutchinson and you're the last one.

638
00:54:40,856 --> 00:54:43,086
Anyway, l don't mean to babble...

639
00:54:43,256 --> 00:54:44,655
What do you want ?

640
00:54:46,296 --> 00:54:49,811
- l'm looking for an N. McCormick.
- Are you FBl ?

641
00:54:50,136 --> 00:54:52,775
Sorry honey,
you are shit outta luck.

642
00:54:54,016 --> 00:54:57,247
You mean there's
no N. McCormick living here ?

643
00:54:57,416 --> 00:55:01,694
l mean we just put him on
a bus headed for New York City.

644
00:55:02,936 --> 00:55:05,370
l'm Neil's friend, Eric,
and this is his Mom.

645
00:55:08,936 --> 00:55:10,369
His name is Neil.

646
00:55:10,896 --> 00:55:12,090
Yeah.

647
00:55:14,376 --> 00:55:15,934
l'm Brian.

648
00:55:16,536 --> 00:55:18,094
Brian Lackey.

649
00:55:28,736 --> 00:55:30,852
So you still haven't written.
Big surprise.

650
00:55:31,016 --> 00:55:33,325
But Wendy says you're doing okay,
which is cool.

651
00:55:33,536 --> 00:55:36,573
I've been wanting to tell you about
this strange guy I met 3 weeks ago.

652
00:55:36,856 --> 00:55:39,814
No, we're not fucking.
Get your mind out of the gutter.

653
00:55:40,296 --> 00:55:42,014
He's not even gay, I don't think.

654
00:55:42,176 --> 00:55:45,691
In fact, his vibe
is kind of weirdly asexual.

655
00:55:45,856 --> 00:55:48,051
His name is Brian Lackey.
He lives in Little River

656
00:55:48,256 --> 00:55:51,487
and, like yours truly,
attends Loser Community College.

657
00:55:51,696 --> 00:55:53,334
Anyway, the day you left,

658
00:55:53,536 --> 00:55:56,972
your mom and I found him
on your doorstep, looking for you.

659
00:55:57,176 --> 00:56:00,407
He says you played Little League
together 1 0 years ago.

660
00:56:00,616 --> 00:56:03,050
He was the worst player
on the team,

661
00:56:03,416 --> 00:56:07,011
He's full of questions about you.
But I haven't told him much,

662
00:56:07,176 --> 00:56:10,009
i.e. about your ''line of work''.

663
00:56:10,176 --> 00:56:13,009
I did say you were queer like me,
I figured you wouldn't care.

664
00:56:13,176 --> 00:56:16,248
But now,
are you ready for the good part ?

665
00:56:16,416 --> 00:56:21,410
He thinks that when you were little,
you were both abducted by aliens.

666
00:56:21,616 --> 00:56:25,655
How brilliant is that ?
But he was completely serious.

667
00:56:25,856 --> 00:56:28,165
You should've seen
the look in his eyes.

668
00:56:28,336 --> 00:56:32,454
So, what's the story, dude ?
Were you abducted by a UFO or what ?

669
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:35,245
P.S. Are your crabs gone yet ?''

670
00:56:44,256 --> 00:56:45,245
Yeah ?

671
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:49,373
- You have a visitor.
- Hi Brian.

672
00:56:49,936 --> 00:56:53,531
l was in the neighborhood
and l thought l'd stop by.

673
00:56:55,256 --> 00:56:57,531
l'll be in the front room
if you need me.

674
00:56:57,736 --> 00:56:59,169
Thanks, Mom.

675
00:57:02,616 --> 00:57:06,086
Didn't care for that film.
That, l didn't see.

676
00:57:07,136 --> 00:57:09,127
Your Mom doesn't like me very much.

677
00:57:09,296 --> 00:57:11,332
She thinks
l'm trying to steal you away.

678
00:57:11,496 --> 00:57:13,487
Any luck in your search
for ''N. McCormick'' ?

679
00:57:14,136 --> 00:57:17,173
l met his mom and his best friend,

680
00:57:17,376 --> 00:57:19,685
but he's in New York right now.

681
00:57:19,896 --> 00:57:21,614
New York. Really ?

682
00:57:24,376 --> 00:57:25,968
Here. Sit down.

683
00:57:32,296 --> 00:57:34,446
Had any more of those dreams ?

684
00:57:35,136 --> 00:57:36,171
Yeah.

685
00:57:36,376 --> 00:57:39,527
But they seem to be slowly evolving.

686
00:57:39,696 --> 00:57:42,847
And maybe it's just because
l've been spending time with Eric,

687
00:57:43,096 --> 00:57:44,848
Neil's friend.

688
00:57:45,096 --> 00:57:47,974
But it's becoming
clearer and clearer that he...

689
00:57:48,336 --> 00:57:51,965
..Neil that is,
is a key figure in all this.

690
00:57:52,536 --> 00:57:55,972
Like he was there with me
the night it all happened.

691
00:57:59,496 --> 00:58:01,327
l can't. Don't.

692
00:58:02,336 --> 00:58:04,133
No. l can't.

693
00:58:04,576 --> 00:58:06,965
- l can't.
- lt's okay.

694
00:58:08,976 --> 00:58:10,773
- No. No. Don't.
- lt'll feel good.

695
00:58:10,976 --> 00:58:12,011
Don't !

696
00:58:14,296 --> 00:58:17,129
- l'm sorry.
- You better go.

697
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,090
- Please.
- l'm sorry, Brian.

698
00:58:36,256 --> 00:58:38,895
l pay 1 20. Not a cent more.

699
00:58:39,976 --> 00:58:41,614
Okay.

700
00:58:41,776 --> 00:58:42,845
Shall we ?

701
00:59:27,736 --> 00:59:29,249
Fuck me !

702
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:31,971
Fuck me up the ass
with your hot, teenaged cock !

703
00:59:37,976 --> 00:59:39,091
Wait !

704
00:59:39,256 --> 00:59:41,372
What the fuck are you doing ?

705
00:59:48,776 --> 00:59:50,255
Okay. Whatever.

706
00:59:52,776 --> 00:59:54,494
l'll put it on for you.

707
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:01,370
There.

708
01:00:05,296 --> 01:00:08,288
Well, come on, stud.
We're on the clock here.

709
01:00:39,496 --> 01:00:41,452
We're not in Kansas anymore, Neil.

710
01:00:42,536 --> 01:00:45,050
You have got to be so careful.

711
01:00:45,896 --> 01:00:49,491
- l know.
- Don't ''l know'' me, Neil McCormick.

712
01:00:49,816 --> 01:00:51,613
This is New York City.

713
01:00:51,976 --> 01:00:54,888
You do the wrong thing with
the wrong person and you die.

714
01:00:55,416 --> 01:00:57,372
Period. End of story.

715
01:01:01,496 --> 01:01:04,215
Just promise me you'll be safe.

716
01:01:08,496 --> 01:01:09,724
Here.

717
01:01:32,176 --> 01:01:34,770
Are these the only kinds
of movies you watch ?

718
01:01:36,456 --> 01:01:38,287
Why ? You don't like it ?

719
01:01:38,736 --> 01:01:40,454
No, it's cool.

720
01:01:43,816 --> 01:01:46,011
So, has Neil gotten back
to you yet ?

721
01:01:47,856 --> 01:01:50,609
Let me explain
The Universe of Neil McCormick.

722
01:01:51,696 --> 01:01:54,290
He's like a planet, Saturn, say.

723
01:01:54,816 --> 01:01:57,728
And we're all like
little moons orbiting around.

724
01:01:57,936 --> 01:02:00,450
Now, do planets write letters ?

725
01:02:01,696 --> 01:02:04,768
But l do know he'll be
in Hutchinson for Christmas.

726
01:02:05,936 --> 01:02:09,770
His mom told me
she sent him a ticket to fly home.

727
01:02:09,936 --> 01:02:11,733
So l'll introduce you then.

728
01:02:15,176 --> 01:02:18,486
- Yeah ?
- How about a study break ?

729
01:02:19,256 --> 01:02:21,053
Thanks, Mrs. Lackey.

730
01:02:21,376 --> 01:02:22,775
Thanks, Mom.

731
01:02:24,576 --> 01:02:26,294
lt's 1 1 :30.

732
01:02:29,336 --> 01:02:32,089
lf it's Avalyn...
tell her l'm not here.

733
01:02:35,936 --> 01:02:39,406
No, l'm sorry, Avalyn,
he's out with his friends.

734
01:02:39,576 --> 01:02:40,895
No problem.

735
01:02:41,056 --> 01:02:45,208
- l thought you kinda liked her.
- l just... l don't know.

736
01:02:46,816 --> 01:02:49,728
l think l just need
a little space from her right now.

737
01:02:49,896 --> 01:02:52,171
l always thought
she was a freak anyway.

738
01:02:52,336 --> 01:02:53,610
l'm off to bed.

739
01:02:53,816 --> 01:02:55,454
Good night, boys.

740
01:03:19,136 --> 01:03:21,252
l'm Zeke.

741
01:03:21,816 --> 01:03:22,805
From L.A.

742
01:03:31,336 --> 01:03:33,770
What are you doing
in New York City ?

743
01:03:41,976 --> 01:03:44,888
That's a Vermeer.

744
01:03:49,856 --> 01:03:52,609
Well, it's sort of a Vermeer.

745
01:04:39,136 --> 01:04:41,252
You are exquisite.

746
01:04:47,416 --> 01:04:49,532
l guess it's my turn, huh ?

747
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:23,205
Hope...
these don't frighten you too much.

748
01:05:25,696 --> 01:05:30,486
They have a habit of popping up
in the most inopportune places.

749
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:42,369
l know. Don't be worried.

750
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:47,332
This is gonna be the safest encounter
you've ever had.

751
01:05:56,136 --> 01:05:58,525
lf you could just rub my back.

752
01:05:58,936 --> 01:06:02,565
Really, l need to be touched.

753
01:06:27,136 --> 01:06:28,649
Make me happy.

754
01:06:58,936 --> 01:07:00,494
Make me happy...

755
01:07:25,376 --> 01:07:27,731
You were 1 00 percent safe, right ?

756
01:07:29,056 --> 01:07:31,490
Yeah. l told you
l just jerked off,

757
01:07:31,656 --> 01:07:34,045
he watched from across the room.

758
01:07:34,216 --> 01:07:37,811
lt was the first time in my life
l'm bothered by it.

759
01:07:39,216 --> 01:07:43,846
Maybe you should try and find
another safer way to make money.

760
01:07:45,976 --> 01:07:47,694
Like everyone else.

761
01:07:51,816 --> 01:07:53,374
Yeah, maybe.

762
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:07,845
You are the only one
l've ever told.

763
01:08:09,736 --> 01:08:10,851
l know.

764
01:08:11,096 --> 01:08:14,054
l never told Eric, or told my Mom.

765
01:08:14,856 --> 01:08:18,644
l know some people might think
it's fucked up, or terrible.

766
01:08:20,016 --> 01:08:23,645
But what happened that summer
is a huge part of me.

767
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:29,133
No one ever made me feel that way,
before or since.

768
01:08:30,376 --> 01:08:31,604
Like l...

769
01:08:33,616 --> 01:08:35,334
l was special.

770
01:08:37,856 --> 01:08:39,972
Neil, you were 8 years old.

771
01:08:40,536 --> 01:08:42,492
Yeah, but he really loved me.

772
01:08:46,296 --> 01:08:48,856
l mean, there were
other kids sometimes, but...

773
01:08:49,936 --> 01:08:52,245
l was his prize.

774
01:08:56,856 --> 01:08:59,211
l was his one true love.

775
01:09:16,856 --> 01:09:18,289
Happy birthday.

776
01:09:18,496 --> 01:09:20,487
You didn't have
to get me anything.

777
01:09:21,056 --> 01:09:23,445
lt's just a little something
l picked out.

778
01:09:32,016 --> 01:09:33,005
Cool.

779
01:09:33,176 --> 01:09:35,292
l thought it'd go great
with your hair color.

780
01:09:35,896 --> 01:09:37,488
lt's so cool. Thanks.

781
01:09:48,696 --> 01:09:49,924
You alright ?

782
01:09:52,176 --> 01:09:54,007
l'm drunk.

783
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:59,009
l've never been drunk in my life.

784
01:09:59,176 --> 01:10:01,132
l'm corrupting you.

785
01:10:01,296 --> 01:10:02,888
At last !

786
01:10:07,296 --> 01:10:08,934
That's pretty good.

787
01:10:09,096 --> 01:10:10,575
Yeah, sure.

788
01:10:11,056 --> 01:10:12,648
No, really.

789
01:10:12,976 --> 01:10:15,410
You have definite artistic talent,
my boy.

790
01:10:20,656 --> 01:10:22,772
That's an interesting touch.

791
01:10:23,816 --> 01:10:27,604
What's the ''deep meaning''
behind the baseball cleats ?

792
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:31,813
l have no idea.

793
01:10:51,816 --> 01:10:54,694
- How was work ?
- Fucking boring.

794
01:10:55,616 --> 01:10:58,005
- You need a hand ?
- Sure.

795
01:11:02,736 --> 01:11:05,170
l've got news for you.

796
01:11:06,496 --> 01:11:09,169
- Well, me too.
- Okay. You first.

797
01:11:09,816 --> 01:11:11,852
Look what my Mom sent me today.

798
01:11:12,016 --> 01:11:14,325
She wants me
to come home for Christmas.

799
01:11:15,976 --> 01:11:17,853
Your mom is the coolest.

800
01:11:18,736 --> 01:11:21,489
- Mine would never do that for me.
- That's weird.

801
01:11:21,696 --> 01:11:24,210
l hate Hutchinson
more than anything.

802
01:11:24,616 --> 01:11:28,575
But l'm kind of looking forward
to going back, just for a short visit.

803
01:11:28,856 --> 01:11:31,450
- Plus you get to see Eric.
- Yeah.

804
01:11:33,576 --> 01:11:35,453
So what's your news ?

805
01:11:36,736 --> 01:11:38,806
l think l found you a job.

806
01:11:39,976 --> 01:11:40,965
What ?

807
01:11:41,136 --> 01:11:44,014
l was talking to this friend
at work about you.

808
01:11:44,216 --> 01:11:47,765
lt's only minimum wage
at a stupid sandwich place, but...

809
01:11:51,216 --> 01:11:54,288
- But ?
- You're not into it, it's cool.

810
01:11:54,696 --> 01:11:56,652
No, tell me more about it.

811
01:11:58,936 --> 01:12:01,609
- Really ?
- l want to hear more about it.

812
01:12:02,256 --> 01:12:04,167
- You do ?
- Yeah.

813
01:12:17,696 --> 01:12:19,652
You sure you're gonna be okay ?

814
01:12:20,776 --> 01:12:23,609
l'm just glad
my Mom's working late.

815
01:12:27,136 --> 01:12:28,933
Thanks for everything.

816
01:12:29,936 --> 01:12:33,485
This has been
the best birthday ever.

817
01:12:36,016 --> 01:12:37,335
You're welcome.

818
01:12:42,256 --> 01:12:43,484
Shit.

819
01:12:44,016 --> 01:12:45,495
Who's that ?

820
01:12:45,656 --> 01:12:47,089
lt's my Dad.

821
01:12:55,176 --> 01:12:56,325
Dad ?

822
01:12:57,536 --> 01:12:58,525
Son.

823
01:12:59,216 --> 01:13:00,729
l caught you.

824
01:13:00,896 --> 01:13:03,251
Your Mother said she didn't know
whether you'd be home or not.

825
01:13:04,456 --> 01:13:06,014
Happy Birthday.

826
01:13:07,056 --> 01:13:08,614
What are you doing here ?

827
01:13:08,776 --> 01:13:11,654
l'm not allowed to wish
my son a happy birthday ?

828
01:13:11,816 --> 01:13:15,013
Dad, l haven't seen you for what,
2 years ?

829
01:13:15,216 --> 01:13:17,969
Well, maybe if you called back...

830
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:20,809
Maybe l don't want to call back.

831
01:13:21,016 --> 01:13:23,450
Maybe l just want you
to leave me alone.

832
01:13:23,616 --> 01:13:25,288
Brian, don't be like this.

833
01:13:25,736 --> 01:13:28,330
l drove all this way.
Just to see how you're doing.

834
01:13:28,496 --> 01:13:30,373
Well, let me tell you
what l want to know.

835
01:13:30,536 --> 01:13:32,925
Something happened to me
when l was little.

836
01:13:33,296 --> 01:13:35,207
Do you know what
l'm talking about ?

837
01:13:35,376 --> 01:13:37,810
When l woke up bleeding
in the cellar ?

838
01:13:38,016 --> 01:13:39,847
Where were you that night ?

839
01:13:40,256 --> 01:13:42,531
God, l can tell
you don't even remember !

840
01:13:43,336 --> 01:13:45,725
- You're drunk.
- Quit avoiding the subject !

841
01:13:46,216 --> 01:13:48,366
l was bleeding,
l kept passing out.

842
01:13:48,776 --> 01:13:52,291
l wet my fucking bed
and you never asked why !

843
01:13:52,496 --> 01:13:54,726
And what about that Halloween ?

844
01:13:54,896 --> 01:13:57,126
Something happened to me
both those nights !

845
01:13:57,296 --> 01:13:59,526
What do you know about it ?
Tell me !

846
01:14:01,936 --> 01:14:03,574
l'm sorry, Brian. l...

847
01:14:05,176 --> 01:14:06,973
l can't help you.

848
01:14:50,576 --> 01:14:52,373
May l help you ?

849
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,049
- Redecorating ?
- Sort of.

850
01:15:06,296 --> 01:15:08,571
- How have you been ?
- Good.

851
01:15:09,016 --> 01:15:11,246
- How's Berkeley ?
- Hold on, you two.

852
01:15:11,416 --> 01:15:13,134
Let's continue this
in the front room

853
01:15:13,296 --> 01:15:15,764
over the peanut-butter peach pie
l baked.

854
01:15:16,816 --> 01:15:19,853
- Good to see you, little brother.
- You too.

855
01:15:46,256 --> 01:15:48,053
Need a lift ?

856
01:15:50,896 --> 01:15:52,170
Sure.

857
01:15:56,536 --> 01:15:58,970
- Where we going ?
- My place.

858
01:15:59,176 --> 01:16:00,768
Don't worry, l'll pay.

859
01:16:07,856 --> 01:16:11,087
- lt's Christmas Eve tomorrow.
- No more talking.

860
01:16:31,776 --> 01:16:34,085
- Where are we ?
- Brighton Beach.

861
01:16:58,696 --> 01:17:00,687
Bedroom's this way.

862
01:17:17,216 --> 01:17:18,615
Do it.

863
01:17:25,416 --> 01:17:26,849
Again.

864
01:17:38,936 --> 01:17:40,289
Strip.

865
01:17:55,776 --> 01:17:57,573
Open wide and suck it, slut.

866
01:18:00,896 --> 01:18:01,965
What are you waiting for, slut ?

867
01:18:05,416 --> 01:18:06,644
Suck it !

868
01:18:08,576 --> 01:18:10,294
You like that, don't you, slut ?

869
01:18:11,616 --> 01:18:13,254
Take it deep.

870
01:18:15,576 --> 01:18:17,055
Moan for me.

871
01:18:23,136 --> 01:18:25,366
Slut knows what's coming next.

872
01:18:25,536 --> 01:18:29,165
- l'm giving slut what he wants...
- There're some things l don't do.

873
01:18:29,376 --> 01:18:32,209
Wait. l gotta take a piss.
l'll be right back.

874
01:18:54,016 --> 01:18:56,928
You're getting fucked, slut,
whether you like it or not.

875
01:19:01,296 --> 01:19:02,445
Slut !

876
01:19:27,416 --> 01:19:29,008
Are you ready ? Here it comes.

877
01:19:55,416 --> 01:19:56,849
Mom.

878
01:22:21,656 --> 01:22:24,090
Today is the day.

879
01:22:33,976 --> 01:22:37,127
- Now where are you off to ?
- l'm going out with Eric.

880
01:22:37,336 --> 01:22:39,531
You don't want to stay
and talk with your sister a while ?

881
01:22:39,696 --> 01:22:42,130
- l'll be back soon.
- Don't be late, young man.

882
01:22:42,336 --> 01:22:44,406
Christmas Eve dinner's at 6 sharp.

883
01:22:53,336 --> 01:22:54,815
Here we are.

884
01:22:55,016 --> 01:22:57,974
- Do l look okay ?
- Okay's a relative term.

885
01:22:59,416 --> 01:23:01,247
l'm kidding.
You look fine.

886
01:23:01,736 --> 01:23:03,966
- Excited ?
- Yes.

887
01:23:05,056 --> 01:23:06,614
And nervous.

888
01:23:06,776 --> 01:23:09,848
Don't worry.
l'm sure you guys will hit it off.

889
01:23:10,056 --> 01:23:11,853
l hope you're right.

890
01:23:22,896 --> 01:23:25,729
- Oh, hi, Eric.
- Mrs. M., Merry Christmas.

891
01:23:27,096 --> 01:23:29,656
- You remember Brian.
- Of course l do.

892
01:23:29,856 --> 01:23:31,812
- Hi, Brian.
- Merry Christmas.

893
01:23:31,976 --> 01:23:35,127
- So where's the Man of the Hour ?
- l was going to call you.

894
01:23:35,936 --> 01:23:39,611
- What happened ?
- There's been an accident.

895
01:23:40,296 --> 01:23:43,254
Neil got mugged

896
01:23:44,136 --> 01:23:45,728
on the way to the airport.

897
01:23:46,456 --> 01:23:48,208
ls he okay ?

898
01:23:48,736 --> 01:23:52,012
He's going to be fine.
He's asleep in his room.

899
01:23:54,096 --> 01:23:57,088
- Maybe we should come back tomorrow.
- Maybe.

900
01:23:57,696 --> 01:24:01,166
Or you stay if you'd like,
have some cookies and see if he's...

901
01:24:05,056 --> 01:24:06,853
Honey, you're up.

902
01:24:08,296 --> 01:24:10,491
The fuck
are you staring at, Preston ?

903
01:24:12,576 --> 01:24:15,807
Brian says you both
were in Little League together.

904
01:24:18,096 --> 01:24:21,088
So how long has it been
since you two last saw each other ?

905
01:24:22,216 --> 01:24:23,729
1 0 years...

906
01:24:24,936 --> 01:24:27,325
..5 months and 7 days.

907
01:24:29,136 --> 01:24:31,969
You must have
a lot of catching up to do.

908
01:24:33,856 --> 01:24:36,211
Turn right off Main
by the fairgrounds.

909
01:24:36,456 --> 01:24:39,766
- So what the fuck happened ?
- Long story. l'll tell you later.

910
01:24:39,936 --> 01:24:41,255
Just drive for now.

911
01:24:41,736 --> 01:24:44,773
lt's nice to see New York
hasn't hardened you one bit...

912
01:24:49,656 --> 01:24:52,329
So you're the legendary Brian.

913
01:24:54,536 --> 01:24:58,211
- We have a lot in common, don't we ?
- l think so.

914
01:25:09,576 --> 01:25:11,806
Make a left at the next stop sign.

915
01:25:14,016 --> 01:25:16,246
ls this starting to look familiar ?

916
01:25:21,936 --> 01:25:24,211
Pick us up in a half hour.

917
01:25:39,496 --> 01:25:41,054
You ready ?

918
01:25:53,816 --> 01:25:55,454
Blue.

919
01:26:05,456 --> 01:26:08,892
No one's home.
Let's go round back.

920
01:26:12,616 --> 01:26:14,413
We have to get in.

921
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,533
l know a way here.

922
01:26:24,976 --> 01:26:25,931
Voil.

923
01:26:26,896 --> 01:26:29,456
You were the best player
on the team, weren't you ?

924
01:26:29,616 --> 01:26:32,414
That's what he always told me.

925
01:26:42,896 --> 01:26:44,375
Help.

926
01:26:55,536 --> 01:26:57,811
This was his bedroom.

927
01:26:58,736 --> 01:27:01,125
At least
the ceiling's still the same.

928
01:27:01,496 --> 01:27:04,886
l used to get lost for hours
staring at all the patterns.

929
01:27:05,496 --> 01:27:08,169
Whirls, speckly sparkly things.

930
01:27:11,536 --> 01:27:12,855
Come on.

931
01:27:23,376 --> 01:27:25,253
What's up with these people ?

932
01:27:25,536 --> 01:27:28,528
He used to keep
these things stocked.

933
01:27:40,336 --> 01:27:42,133
This is it, right ?

934
01:27:51,456 --> 01:27:53,253
Why now ?

935
01:27:54,656 --> 01:27:57,170
Why did you search me out ?

936
01:27:59,296 --> 01:28:01,207
l'm tired of it.

937
01:28:01,416 --> 01:28:04,089
l want to dream about
something else for a change.

938
01:28:19,576 --> 01:28:21,646
''Away in a Manger''...

939
01:28:22,656 --> 01:28:26,649
lt took till l actually laid eyes
on you today to remember you.

940
01:28:28,216 --> 01:28:33,244
When Eric wrote me, l only got
the vaguest picture in my head.

941
01:28:33,416 --> 01:28:36,010
Like a staticky TV.

942
01:28:36,176 --> 01:28:38,087
Same here.

943
01:28:38,656 --> 01:28:40,328
But seeing you here...

944
01:28:40,936 --> 01:28:42,335
..in this room...

945
01:28:43,776 --> 01:28:46,688
l feel like
he's watching us right now.

946
01:28:49,416 --> 01:28:51,771
l have no idea
what happened to him.

947
01:28:51,976 --> 01:28:54,206
After that summer,
he just disappeared.

948
01:28:54,856 --> 01:28:56,926
l don't know
if he's even alive or what.

949
01:28:57,696 --> 01:29:00,210
Maybe it's his ghost watching us.

950
01:29:00,496 --> 01:29:02,248
Tell me everything you can.

951
01:29:09,376 --> 01:29:11,731
l was his favorite.

952
01:29:13,136 --> 01:29:15,127
Out of everyone, he picked me.

953
01:29:17,056 --> 01:29:19,206
l know it sounds
kind of weird, but...

954
01:29:19,456 --> 01:29:22,016
..when it first started happening...

955
01:29:22,896 --> 01:29:25,012
l felt honored.

956
01:29:25,456 --> 01:29:26,855
Go on.

957
01:29:30,616 --> 01:29:32,925
This is where the big TV was,

958
01:29:33,096 --> 01:29:35,246
all the cool video games.

959
01:29:35,416 --> 01:29:37,327
That's the kitchen.

960
01:29:38,176 --> 01:29:40,565
The first time happened there...

961
01:29:44,896 --> 01:29:46,852
lt lasted that whole summer.

962
01:29:47,496 --> 01:29:49,248
Just me and him.

963
01:29:49,696 --> 01:29:52,130
l saw him one other time.

964
01:29:53,176 --> 01:29:55,406
On Halloween,
a couple years later.

965
01:29:56,216 --> 01:29:58,013
l was lost.

966
01:29:59,176 --> 01:30:00,814
He said my name.

967
01:30:01,536 --> 01:30:02,764
Brian ?

968
01:30:03,496 --> 01:30:04,724
Brian ?

969
01:30:09,576 --> 01:30:11,373
I thought that was you.

970
01:30:13,496 --> 01:30:15,726
The game had just started.

971
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:18,536
l was sitting on the bench
as always.

972
01:30:19,096 --> 01:30:20,973
lt started to rain...

973
01:30:21,176 --> 01:30:24,134
Sprinkles at first, then a downpour.

974
01:30:26,776 --> 01:30:28,607
The ump called the game.

975
01:30:28,976 --> 01:30:30,648
And no one came to pick you up.

976
01:30:31,376 --> 01:30:33,936
My Mom was working and my Dad,

977
01:30:34,136 --> 01:30:35,285
who knows.

978
01:30:35,856 --> 01:30:38,654
Everyone else drove off
with their parents.

979
01:30:38,816 --> 01:30:41,046
l was left there all alone.

980
01:30:42,376 --> 01:30:44,606
Then you were in the dugout
with me and you said...

981
01:30:45,176 --> 01:30:47,212
We'll take you home.

982
01:30:50,176 --> 01:30:54,010
And we got in Coach's
station wagon, remember ?

983
01:30:58,376 --> 01:31:00,173
He brought us here.

984
01:31:02,496 --> 01:31:05,488
It's alright, Brian.
We're going to have a little fun.

985
01:31:09,296 --> 01:31:12,652
And he didn't want you in the bedroom
because that was just for us.

986
01:31:13,656 --> 01:31:16,648
So it all happened here,
in this room.

987
01:31:17,576 --> 01:31:18,975
Keep going.

988
01:31:19,496 --> 01:31:21,487
Don't stop until
you've told me everything.

989
01:31:25,176 --> 01:31:27,895
When there was another boy,
it was always the same.

990
01:31:28,096 --> 01:31:31,008
The Coach used me as a prop
to pull you in.

991
01:31:32,376 --> 01:31:36,085
He'd undress me and
and l had to make it seem fun.

992
01:31:36,296 --> 01:31:38,412
Like it was a really cool game.

993
01:31:38,616 --> 01:31:40,095
Go ahead, show him, Neil.

994
01:31:40,256 --> 01:31:44,374
Alright, here are the rules.
I kiss you, then you kiss me back.

995
01:31:44,576 --> 01:31:46,055
And then it's his turn.

996
01:31:48,296 --> 01:31:50,048
Are you ready ?

997
01:31:52,736 --> 01:31:53,964
Here we go.

998
01:31:56,496 --> 01:31:57,895
My God...

999
01:31:59,496 --> 01:32:00,815
You want me to stop ?

1000
01:32:08,376 --> 01:32:11,015
So l put my tongue
in your mouth,

1001
01:32:11,656 --> 01:32:14,090
getting it all wet and shiny.

1002
01:32:14,496 --> 01:32:16,327
Then it was his turn.

1003
01:32:18,096 --> 01:32:20,769
Watching his big lips
sucking your face,

1004
01:32:20,936 --> 01:32:24,167
l remember thinking
he's going to swallow his head whole.

1005
01:32:26,896 --> 01:32:29,694
So, we took off your clothes

1006
01:32:31,536 --> 01:32:35,324
and you made
this whimpering puppy sound

1007
01:32:35,896 --> 01:32:38,490
that Coach always loved.

1008
01:32:38,696 --> 01:32:40,891
Coach and me had this thing

1009
01:32:41,096 --> 01:32:45,886
where he would wrap
his mouth around my dick and balls.

1010
01:32:46,576 --> 01:32:48,407
He did that to me

1011
01:32:49,216 --> 01:32:50,854
and l tried to do it to you
but couldn't

1012
01:32:51,016 --> 01:32:54,213
because my mouth was too small.

1013
01:32:57,336 --> 01:33:00,134
Then, he went down on you

1014
01:33:03,216 --> 01:33:06,447
for what seemed like
a really long time.

1015
01:33:06,656 --> 01:33:08,567
Now your eyes
were closed mostly

1016
01:33:08,736 --> 01:33:10,806
but every now and then
they would flutter open,

1017
01:33:10,976 --> 01:33:14,491
and had this glassy,
faraway look.

1018
01:33:16,656 --> 01:33:18,009
And then...

1019
01:33:18,376 --> 01:33:20,287
l leaned in and whispered...

1020
01:33:20,456 --> 01:33:24,051
It's fun right ?
Tell him you like it.

1021
01:33:36,016 --> 01:33:38,371
We're almost finished.

1022
01:33:38,856 --> 01:33:40,528
Can you be able...?

1023
01:33:40,696 --> 01:33:41,890
Yeah.

1024
01:33:44,776 --> 01:33:47,290
Then we played the 5 dollar game.

1025
01:33:48,176 --> 01:33:52,408
When Coach would ask me
to do things, crazy sex things.

1026
01:33:52,736 --> 01:33:55,011
And if l could do them,
he'd give me a 5 dollar bill.

1027
01:33:55,176 --> 01:33:57,895
It's okay. Go ahead, Neil.

1028
01:34:08,056 --> 01:34:10,092
He made us fist him.

1029
01:34:10,616 --> 01:34:12,208
Do you know what that is ?

1030
01:34:18,136 --> 01:34:20,445
l went first, of course.

1031
01:34:20,696 --> 01:34:23,768
And on that night,
the 5 dollars was mine

1032
01:34:25,096 --> 01:34:30,568
if l could ram my fist up his ass
all the way to the elbow.

1033
01:34:31,336 --> 01:34:33,531
And goddamn it, l did it.

1034
01:34:33,976 --> 01:34:35,887
l'll never forget how it felt.

1035
01:34:36,096 --> 01:34:39,372
lt felt like his body
was trying to suck me into it.

1036
01:34:40,056 --> 01:34:41,728
Devour me.

1037
01:34:43,936 --> 01:34:45,972
And then l did it too.

1038
01:34:53,016 --> 01:34:54,165
And then

1039
01:34:54,816 --> 01:34:57,853
we drove you back to Little River
and left you in your driveway.

1040
01:34:58,016 --> 01:34:59,131
The End.

1041
01:35:03,256 --> 01:35:05,531
And my nose was bleeding.

1042
01:35:07,816 --> 01:35:09,408
How did that happen ?

1043
01:35:20,456 --> 01:35:23,050
When it was over and
we were getting you dressed,

1044
01:35:25,536 --> 01:35:28,733
your face looked like
you'd been erased.

1045
01:35:29,656 --> 01:35:32,216
And you were just empty inside.
And you just fell.

1046
01:35:32,536 --> 01:35:35,812
Face first on the floor.

1047
01:35:36,576 --> 01:35:39,409
And when we pulled you up,
your nose was bleeding.

1048
01:35:40,256 --> 01:35:41,894
Like this ?

1049
01:35:44,896 --> 01:35:46,454
Like this ?

1050
01:35:47,336 --> 01:35:48,371
Stop.

1051
01:35:59,456 --> 01:36:03,495
- No one's even home.
- No, someone's there.

1052
01:36:03,696 --> 01:36:05,448
- l can see them.
- Where ?

1053
01:36:05,936 --> 01:36:08,450
- l don't see anything.
- Now l see them too.

1054
01:36:08,816 --> 01:36:10,534
What's going on ?

1055
01:36:10,976 --> 01:36:13,012
l think someone's in there.

1056
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:46,054
And as we sat there
listening to the carolers,

1057
01:36:46,216 --> 01:36:50,129
I wanted to tell Brian it was over
and everything would be okay.

1058
01:36:50,336 --> 01:36:52,088
But that was a lie.

1059
01:36:52,256 --> 01:36:54,133
Plus I couldn't speak anyway.

1060
01:36:55,336 --> 01:36:59,170
I wished there's some way for us
to go back and undo the past.

1061
01:37:00,376 --> 01:37:02,651
But there wasn't.

1062
01:37:03,136 --> 01:37:05,604
There was nothing we could do.

1063
01:37:06,056 --> 01:37:08,934
So I just stayed silent and tried

1064
01:37:09,136 --> 01:37:11,013
to telepathically communicate

1065
01:37:11,216 --> 01:37:14,606
how sorry I was
about what had happened.

1066
01:37:15,816 --> 01:37:19,650
I thought of all the sadness
and suffering in the world.

1067
01:37:20,136 --> 01:37:22,127
And made me want to escape.

1068
01:37:23,016 --> 01:37:26,725
I wished with all my heart we
could just leave this world behind.

1069
01:37:27,816 --> 01:37:31,445
Rise like two angels
in the night and magically...

1070
01:37:32,536 --> 01:37:34,254
..disappear.

1071
01:40:43,976 --> 01:40:47,048
