1
00:00:41,788 --> 00:00:42,748
Yes?

2
00:00:43,415 --> 00:00:46,584
Pierre, there's
an urgent call from France.

3
00:00:48,211 --> 00:00:50,129
After the concert.

4
00:00:53,883 --> 00:00:55,885
It's about your mother.

5
00:01:04,476 --> 00:01:05,477
Yes?

6
00:03:00,123 --> 00:03:02,459
Do you remember me?

7
00:03:03,627 --> 00:03:05,378
Fond de I'tang.

8
00:03:05,462 --> 00:03:07,839
"My father is coming for me
on Saturday."

9
00:03:09,507 --> 00:03:11,843
Ppinot.

10
00:03:11,884 --> 00:03:13,636
Of course.

11
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:15,930
Ppinot.

12
00:03:16,972 --> 00:03:20,058
- How long has it been?
- About 50 years.

13
00:03:23,019 --> 00:03:24,437
Fond de I'tang.

14
00:03:27,607 --> 00:03:30,651
You're the little guy in the front row.

15
00:03:30,693 --> 00:03:32,778
And there you are.

16
00:03:32,862 --> 00:03:35,447
Do you remember the prefect's name?

17
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:37,408
Clment Mathieu.

18
00:03:37,491 --> 00:03:38,951
Clment Mathieu.

19
00:03:40,869 --> 00:03:43,330
I wonder what happened to him.

20
00:03:45,373 --> 00:03:47,083
Open it.

21
00:03:51,671 --> 00:03:53,172
"Fond de I'tang.

22
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:54,924
1949."

23
00:03:55,007 --> 00:03:58,719
Mathieu kept a journal
while he worked at Fond de I'tang.

24
00:03:58,761 --> 00:04:01,763
That's his story. Ours too.

25
00:04:03,014 --> 00:04:04,975
He wanted you to have it.

26
00:04:05,058 --> 00:04:09,020
I'd have preferred to deliver it
under different circumstances, but...

27
00:04:12,815 --> 00:04:15,067
"January 15, 1949.

28
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,530
After failing for so long
in so many fields,

29
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:22,699
I was sure the worst was still to come."

30
00:04:23,742 --> 00:04:28,037
It was a boarding school where
troubled children were rehabilitated.

31
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:31,290
That's what the advertisement said.

32
00:04:31,332 --> 00:04:33,334
Fond de I'tang.

33
00:04:33,417 --> 00:04:36,545
Even the name seemed
to fit me like a glove.

34
00:04:37,838 --> 00:04:38,797
Hello.

35
00:04:40,257 --> 00:04:42,134
You're all alone?

36
00:04:42,717 --> 00:04:44,427
What are you doing there?

37
00:04:45,470 --> 00:04:47,639
Waiting for Saturday.

38
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,015
Why?

39
00:04:50,349 --> 00:04:52,727
My father is coming for me.

40
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:54,854
But it's not Saturday.

41
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:55,855
Ppinot.

42
00:04:57,106 --> 00:04:58,232
Ppinot.

43
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:02,652
Hello. I'm Clment Mathieu,
the new prefect.

44
00:05:04,613 --> 00:05:06,531
Have you done this type of work before?

45
00:05:06,614 --> 00:05:08,533
I taught some classes in private school.

46
00:05:08,616 --> 00:05:10,535
- What did you teach?
- Music.

47
00:05:10,618 --> 00:05:14,955
You'll like Rachin, our headmaster.
He used to play the trumpet.

48
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:16,540
- Hello, Ppinot.
- Hello.

49
00:05:16,624 --> 00:05:19,001
His daughters. He lives right there.

50
00:05:21,378 --> 00:05:24,256
- You haven't met Mr. Rachin?
- Not yet, no.

51
00:05:24,339 --> 00:05:26,883
- Mrs. Boissemand recommended me.
- Really?

52
00:05:26,966 --> 00:05:29,010
That was old Maxence.

53
00:05:29,093 --> 00:05:32,305
He told me on the spot
that he was the school watchman,

54
00:05:32,346 --> 00:05:35,766
as well as its nurse,
storekeeper and glazier.

55
00:05:38,352 --> 00:05:41,647
- What is he doing?
- Serving detention for Mr. Rachin.

56
00:05:42,189 --> 00:05:45,275
Fifteen days of community work.
In other words, school drudge.

57
00:05:45,358 --> 00:05:47,861
What kind of children are they, exactly?

58
00:05:47,944 --> 00:05:50,071
- No one told you?
- No.

59
00:05:51,822 --> 00:05:54,450
My infirmary. I'll show you
my vegetable garden later.

60
00:05:54,492 --> 00:05:55,993
I'd like that.

61
00:05:58,704 --> 00:06:01,373
- Damn it! What have they done now?
- I'll help you.

62
00:06:01,456 --> 00:06:03,375
Are you Clment Mathieu?

63
00:06:03,416 --> 00:06:05,168
The headmaster...

64
00:06:05,251 --> 00:06:07,795
Rachin, the school's headmaster.

65
00:06:07,837 --> 00:06:09,964
Headmaster, I'm sorry...

66
00:06:10,006 --> 00:06:12,508
- Yes, you're late.
- I had the wrong bus schedule.

67
00:06:12,592 --> 00:06:14,427
Punctuality is essential here.

68
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:16,178
Very well.

69
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,179
Headmaster.

70
00:06:18,222 --> 00:06:19,640
Very well, Headmaster.

71
00:06:19,681 --> 00:06:21,350
Come with me.

72
00:06:22,017 --> 00:06:25,103
First you should study
the school regulations,

73
00:06:25,145 --> 00:06:28,147
then you can supervise
the 4:00 study period before you...

74
00:06:31,317 --> 00:06:33,736
What are you doing? Answer me.

75
00:06:33,778 --> 00:06:35,571
- Take this.
- It's my eye.

76
00:06:35,654 --> 00:06:38,699
Another trap. You can appreciate
our boarders' finer instincts.

77
00:06:38,741 --> 00:06:40,742
Get him over there.

78
00:06:40,784 --> 00:06:42,494
I'm blinded.

79
00:06:42,577 --> 00:06:45,372
Don't make a fuss. Show me.

80
00:06:45,455 --> 00:06:47,499
It's not pretty.

81
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:49,667
Ring the bell. School assembly.

82
00:06:49,751 --> 00:06:52,503
- We should call a doctor.
- Do you know how much they charge?

83
00:06:52,587 --> 00:06:54,964
What did I say? Ring the assembly.

84
00:06:55,005 --> 00:06:56,340
The bell?

85
00:06:56,382 --> 00:06:58,759
Next to the door,
right in front of you.

86
00:06:58,801 --> 00:06:59,760
All right.

87
00:07:02,804 --> 00:07:04,264
Assembly.

88
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:07,142
Assembly.

89
00:07:08,434 --> 00:07:11,270
- Are they always like that?
- Keep ringing the bell.

90
00:07:20,571 --> 00:07:22,322
Two abreast.

91
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:28,661
Everybody in the schoolyard.
Assembly.

92
00:07:32,206 --> 00:07:33,624
Hurry up.

93
00:07:34,417 --> 00:07:36,502
Move faster. Be silent.

94
00:07:37,711 --> 00:07:39,421
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.

95
00:07:41,006 --> 00:07:42,924
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.

96
00:07:44,884 --> 00:07:45,969
Be silent.

97
00:07:46,052 --> 00:07:47,971
- I didn't say anything.
- Be silent.

98
00:07:54,685 --> 00:07:56,770
I called this assembly

99
00:07:56,812 --> 00:08:00,399
because of a despicable attempt
against old Maxence.

100
00:08:00,482 --> 00:08:04,486
Under our action-reaction rule,
the culprit will be severely punished.

101
00:08:06,029 --> 00:08:09,032
I want the culprit's name
within the next three seconds,

102
00:08:09,115 --> 00:08:12,201
or it's six hours of lock-up
for each one of you.

103
00:08:12,285 --> 00:08:16,747
Effective until he's betrayed
or gives himself up.

104
00:08:16,830 --> 00:08:18,248
Is that clear?

105
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:19,958
One...

106
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:21,460
Two...

107
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:23,211
Three.

108
00:08:23,295 --> 00:08:24,713
No volunteers?

109
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:27,132
Of course. Come closer.

110
00:08:28,967 --> 00:08:30,760
- Mathieu.
- Me?

111
00:08:30,802 --> 00:08:32,678
Come closer.

112
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,680
The school register, Mr. Chabert.

113
00:08:34,764 --> 00:08:36,181
Thank you.

114
00:08:36,265 --> 00:08:39,601
Mr. Mathieu, your new prefect,
has been spared your acquaintance.

115
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:42,145
- Chrome Dome.
- Be silent.

116
00:08:42,187 --> 00:08:45,607
So he can choose
who goes first without bias.

117
00:08:49,569 --> 00:08:50,695
Be silent.

118
00:08:50,778 --> 00:08:52,780
Pick a name.

119
00:08:52,863 --> 00:08:54,532
At random?

120
00:08:56,617 --> 00:08:59,161
- A word of advice...
- Don't interfere. Go on.

121
00:09:02,622 --> 00:09:03,874
Boniface.

122
00:09:05,917 --> 00:09:07,961
Too bad. Chabert, get Boniface.

123
00:09:10,505 --> 00:09:12,923
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
- Shut up.

124
00:09:12,965 --> 00:09:15,718
- It's lousy, I didn't do anything.
- Watch your language.

125
00:09:15,801 --> 00:09:17,177
Move.

126
00:09:17,219 --> 00:09:19,429
- I won't go.
- I'll kick your backside for you.

127
00:09:19,513 --> 00:09:21,431
Be silent.

128
00:09:21,473 --> 00:09:23,892
Furthermore,
until I've found the culprit,

129
00:09:23,975 --> 00:09:26,978
there will be no recess
and no visitors.

130
00:09:27,061 --> 00:09:29,439
I advise you to give him up quickly.

131
00:09:29,522 --> 00:09:31,774
It's an encouragement to turn informer.

132
00:09:32,608 --> 00:09:35,444
You're full of noble illusions
like any new staff member.

133
00:09:35,486 --> 00:09:37,446
Come see me in eight days.

134
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:40,699
You'll be replacing Mr. Rgent.
He'll explain your duties.

135
00:09:44,869 --> 00:09:46,746
Clean sheets.

136
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,122
Thank you.

137
00:09:50,249 --> 00:09:52,168
Why are you leaving?

138
00:09:53,669 --> 00:09:55,880
Ten stitches.

139
00:09:55,963 --> 00:09:58,298
Cut with scissors.

140
00:09:58,340 --> 00:10:01,134
Just for confiscating
Mouton's cigarettes.

141
00:10:01,218 --> 00:10:03,887
- Mouton?
- The boy's name is Mouton.

142
00:10:05,889 --> 00:10:07,932
And Mouton's still here?

143
00:10:10,601 --> 00:10:13,521
By the way, Le Querrec
booby-trapped Maxence's door.

144
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:16,440
I heard him talking about it
in the corridor.

145
00:10:16,523 --> 00:10:19,318
- And you didn't say anything?
- I didn't want to miss the bus.

146
00:10:20,277 --> 00:10:22,863
Old Maxence punished him
for breaking some glass panes.

147
00:10:22,946 --> 00:10:25,156
Simple revenge. That's just his style.

148
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:27,408
Le Querrec.

149
00:10:28,826 --> 00:10:31,162
Don't forget that name: Le Querrec.

150
00:10:31,245 --> 00:10:32,663
- Morhange too.
- Yes.

151
00:10:32,747 --> 00:10:35,624
Morhange doesn't talk much,
but keep an eye on him.

152
00:10:35,708 --> 00:10:38,585
Looks like an angel,
acts like the devil.

153
00:10:38,669 --> 00:10:40,629
Action-reaction.

154
00:10:40,712 --> 00:10:42,631
That's all they understand.

155
00:10:46,009 --> 00:10:47,927
They're all yours.

156
00:10:49,595 --> 00:10:51,681
- Good luck.
- Thank you.

157
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:00,939
Our benefactresses.

158
00:11:01,023 --> 00:11:02,899
The timetable's over there.

159
00:11:02,983 --> 00:11:05,360
Classes were shared
between the headmaster,

160
00:11:05,443 --> 00:11:07,362
who taught French and History,

161
00:11:07,445 --> 00:11:10,907
and Mr. Langlois,
who taught every other subject.

162
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:13,159
Mr. Langlois, here's the new prefect.

163
00:11:13,242 --> 00:11:14,952
Clment Mathieu.

164
00:11:15,035 --> 00:11:18,580
- A prefect at your age?
- Yes, but I used to teach.

165
00:11:18,664 --> 00:11:20,916
Very well then.

166
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:27,130
And he's the funny one.

167
00:11:27,172 --> 00:11:31,008
Take your study period. You're late.
No need to show you the way.

168
00:11:53,487 --> 00:11:55,322
Watch out. Chrome Dome's coming.

169
00:12:03,288 --> 00:12:05,123
Gentlemen.

170
00:12:10,002 --> 00:12:11,879
No smoking during class.

171
00:12:13,297 --> 00:12:15,883
The rules apply to everyone.
Even you, sir.

172
00:12:19,803 --> 00:12:22,305
Give it back.

173
00:12:22,389 --> 00:12:23,807
Be quiet.

174
00:12:23,890 --> 00:12:25,392
Give it back.

175
00:12:26,309 --> 00:12:28,394
Be silent.

176
00:12:28,436 --> 00:12:29,896
Give it back.

177
00:12:33,149 --> 00:12:36,110
An auspicious beginning.
Congratulations, Mathieu.

178
00:12:36,193 --> 00:12:37,736
Sit.

179
00:12:40,364 --> 00:12:41,615
Of course.

180
00:12:41,656 --> 00:12:44,367
You again.

181
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:47,579
What did he do?

182
00:12:47,662 --> 00:12:49,080
Nothing, Headmaster.

183
00:12:50,123 --> 00:12:53,334
What do you mean, "nothing?"
You were about to punish him.

184
00:12:53,417 --> 00:12:55,794
I asked him to go to the blackboard

185
00:12:55,878 --> 00:12:58,130
and I was just telling them
to be silent.

186
00:12:58,213 --> 00:13:00,841
Not a minute too soon.

187
00:13:01,758 --> 00:13:03,677
Don't make me come back.

188
00:13:09,807 --> 00:13:12,226
Stand in the corner.

189
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:15,271
Very well.

190
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:20,150
Now that you've come to know me,
we need to set things straight.

191
00:13:20,234 --> 00:13:23,195
Right now,
one of your classmates is in lock-up.

192
00:13:23,278 --> 00:13:25,155
For no good reason.

193
00:13:25,238 --> 00:13:28,408
I may not look like much
but I'm no fool.

194
00:13:28,491 --> 00:13:30,368
I know who did it.

195
00:13:30,451 --> 00:13:33,412
He has 15 seconds to give himself up.

196
00:13:36,457 --> 00:13:38,250
I'm waiting.

197
00:13:39,918 --> 00:13:42,754
You'll regret it. Five seconds left.

198
00:13:44,673 --> 00:13:46,800
Too late.

199
00:13:47,634 --> 00:13:49,052
Le Querrec.

200
00:13:50,094 --> 00:13:51,554
Who is Le Querrec?

201
00:13:52,471 --> 00:13:54,557
I am, sir.

202
00:13:55,724 --> 00:13:57,434
What a surprise.

203
00:13:57,935 --> 00:14:01,188
- You hurt Mr. Maxence.
- No, sir. I didn't do it.

204
00:14:01,271 --> 00:14:03,899
- That wasn't a question.
- I didn't do anything.

205
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:06,943
Between the two of us, I wonder
who the headmaster will believe.

206
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:12,198
I need someone dependable
to keep an eye on things while I'm gone.

207
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,160
According to my sixth sense,
that dependable student must be...

208
00:14:16,243 --> 00:14:17,953
...Mr. Morhange.

209
00:14:19,538 --> 00:14:22,791
Come on, come on.
Who is Mr. Morhange?

210
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:25,585
That's me, sir.

211
00:14:32,425 --> 00:14:35,136
So you're the angel.

212
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:39,848
Go down. You'll supervise
the class while I'm gone.

213
00:14:39,932 --> 00:14:41,600
Go on.

214
00:14:41,683 --> 00:14:45,937
Nice. You could pull out
your shirt a bit more.

215
00:14:46,020 --> 00:14:50,066
I'm told the rebellious have
strong leadership skills. Prove it.

216
00:14:51,025 --> 00:14:53,694
Come to the headmaster's office.

217
00:14:55,946 --> 00:14:58,323
- Have mercy, sir.
- Mercy?

218
00:14:58,407 --> 00:15:01,952
What about the boy who's taken
your place? And old Maxence?

219
00:15:01,993 --> 00:15:04,412
I didn't want to hurt him.
It was just a joke.

220
00:15:04,496 --> 00:15:06,081
A joke?

221
00:15:06,164 --> 00:15:11,002
...a little stint in lock-up.
I've had enough of you.

222
00:15:11,085 --> 00:15:14,422
But first, I'm going to give you
the flogging of your life.

223
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,384
- Who is it?
- Leclerc.

224
00:15:19,426 --> 00:15:23,763
He's tried to run away three times.
He's taking him to lock-up.

225
00:15:23,805 --> 00:15:26,015
- So you won't be alone.
- Don't.

226
00:15:29,227 --> 00:15:32,730
Maybe we can come to an agreement.

227
00:15:32,813 --> 00:15:35,191
You hurt Mr. Maxence. Badly.

228
00:15:35,274 --> 00:15:38,610
I won't take you to the headmaster
but I have to punish you.

229
00:15:39,653 --> 00:15:44,282
Instead of fooling around during recess,
you'll work in the infirmary.

230
00:15:44,324 --> 00:15:46,743
You'll be old Maxence's nurse.

231
00:15:46,785 --> 00:15:49,412
You'll look after him until he's cured.

232
00:15:49,495 --> 00:15:50,872
All right?

233
00:16:08,930 --> 00:16:10,723
Not bad.

234
00:16:10,807 --> 00:16:12,516
What do you think?

235
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,978
But I can do better. Give me the chalk.
Stand in profile.

236
00:16:16,061 --> 00:16:17,688
Profile.

237
00:16:30,908 --> 00:16:33,369
Let's see a smile for a change.

238
00:16:33,452 --> 00:16:36,247
You can look now.

239
00:16:36,288 --> 00:16:39,625
I almost forgot...
Some color would be nice.

240
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,422
Much better. Get back to your seat.

241
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:48,925
Very well.

242
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:53,471
I want to get to know you,
so you're going to write your name,

243
00:16:53,554 --> 00:16:57,057
your age and your dream job
on a piece of paper.

244
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:06,733
I was astonished when
they all did as they were told.

245
00:17:10,736 --> 00:17:13,531
All except one.

246
00:17:17,201 --> 00:17:19,119
You're not writing?

247
00:17:21,580 --> 00:17:24,457
How long have you been here?

248
00:17:24,499 --> 00:17:26,918
A long time?

249
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:29,003
I don't know.

250
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,715
Write, little fellow.

251
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:50,565
An exhausting first day.

252
00:17:50,606 --> 00:17:53,734
I forgot why I came here
in the first place.

253
00:17:53,776 --> 00:17:57,863
Rachin scares me, the building
scares me, even the children scare me.

254
00:17:57,905 --> 00:18:02,117
I keep expecting them
to slip into my recess and murder me.

255
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,618
My blanket.

256
00:18:04,786 --> 00:18:07,163
- Got a cigarette?
- Shut up.

257
00:18:07,247 --> 00:18:08,665
Go to bed.

258
00:18:23,595 --> 00:18:26,806
I read the assignments again.

259
00:18:26,890 --> 00:18:29,267
They all had fabulous dreams.

260
00:18:29,350 --> 00:18:32,603
Two firemen, three cowboys,
one tiger tamer, one fighter pilot,

261
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:37,274
two spies, a general under Napoleon,
one balloonist, three legionaries...

262
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,611
Not one school prefect.

263
00:18:42,237 --> 00:18:45,281
It was nice of you
to volunteer to be my nurse.

264
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:50,536
Doctor, the new prefect asked
for a volunteer to take care of me.

265
00:18:50,578 --> 00:18:53,414
And he raised his hand right away.

266
00:18:53,456 --> 00:18:55,875
Proof that
we should believe in miracles.

267
00:18:55,916 --> 00:18:57,835
Come in.

268
00:18:57,918 --> 00:19:00,504
Mr. Mathieu, the new prefect.

269
00:19:02,339 --> 00:19:03,465
So?

270
00:19:03,548 --> 00:19:06,551
It's pretty bad, Maxence.

271
00:19:06,634 --> 00:19:09,512
If they've started attacking you,
they're beyond help.

272
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:12,515
You're so patient with them.

273
00:19:12,598 --> 00:19:16,101
I've got a thick skull.
You shouldn't be feeling sorry for me.

274
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:19,688
I feel sorry for those poor kids.
Don't forget one of them is dead.

275
00:19:19,771 --> 00:19:21,106
Dead?

276
00:19:21,189 --> 00:19:23,859
His name was Mouton.
He jumped off the roof.

277
00:19:23,942 --> 00:19:26,069
Good thing he was an orphan.

278
00:19:26,152 --> 00:19:29,197
Look at him. Everyone says
he's a lost cause. It's not true.

279
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,617
He's a good boy.
You just have to know him.

280
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,743
Old Maxence is a nice guy.

281
00:19:36,287 --> 00:19:39,831
I'm talking to you, Le Querrec.
Don't you think he's nice?

282
00:19:41,124 --> 00:19:43,043
No?

283
00:19:43,126 --> 00:19:44,085
Yes.

284
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:46,546
- I didn't hear you.
- Leave him alone. He's shy.

285
00:19:46,629 --> 00:19:48,298
Like me.

286
00:19:49,841 --> 00:19:51,968
One, two, three, four...

287
00:19:54,303 --> 00:19:56,180
Faster.

288
00:19:58,599 --> 00:19:59,641
Yes?

289
00:19:59,725 --> 00:20:02,227
- I'd like a word, Headmaster.
- Leaving us so soon?

290
00:20:02,310 --> 00:20:05,647
- No, I'd like to try something.
- You don't say.

291
00:20:05,730 --> 00:20:08,733
About the accident.

292
00:20:08,816 --> 00:20:11,068
- That was no accident.
- Quite.

293
00:20:11,110 --> 00:20:13,070
I need three things from you.

294
00:20:13,154 --> 00:20:16,156
- Is that all?
- One, cancel the group punishment,

295
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:21,995
two, let me deal with the culprit,
and three, don't ask me for his name.

296
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,247
You'd have to know it first.

297
00:20:24,331 --> 00:20:25,707
Naturally.

298
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:29,794
Your arrogance astounds me.
Do you really think you'll find him?

299
00:20:29,877 --> 00:20:33,631
Very well. If you succeed,
I'll cancel the group punishment.

300
00:20:33,714 --> 00:20:37,176
But you'll never get the culprit
or I'm the biggest fool in nature.

301
00:20:38,844 --> 00:20:41,471
I know who did it, Headmaster.

302
00:20:42,722 --> 00:20:44,849
Congratulations.

303
00:20:44,891 --> 00:20:47,310
Who is it?

304
00:20:47,393 --> 00:20:49,562
You said I wouldn't have to tell you.

305
00:20:50,938 --> 00:20:53,649
Fine. Very well then.

306
00:20:53,691 --> 00:20:55,693
But I don't like your manners.

307
00:20:55,776 --> 00:20:58,529
You'd better make sure
your students behave.

308
00:20:58,570 --> 00:21:02,074
- I've already got them under control.
- That's what you think.

309
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:04,784
One, two, three, four... Go on.

310
00:21:05,952 --> 00:21:07,162
Faster.

311
00:21:20,632 --> 00:21:24,302
- There's no pictures of naked women.
- I never said there were naked women.

312
00:21:24,344 --> 00:21:26,262
What does yours say?

313
00:21:26,346 --> 00:21:30,016
"Ave Maria for soprano
by Clment Mathieu."

314
00:21:30,099 --> 00:21:33,519
I've got, "String quartet...

315
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:36,605
...by Clment Mathieu."
- Looks like music.

316
00:21:36,689 --> 00:21:39,066
- What do you know about it?
- Maybe it's Morse.

317
00:21:39,149 --> 00:21:41,526
- Or some secret code.
- Maybe he's no prefect.

318
00:21:41,568 --> 00:21:43,904
Maybe he's an undercover spy.

319
00:21:43,987 --> 00:21:45,238
Chrome Dome.

320
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:57,499
Give it back to me.

321
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:00,085
- What is it, sir?
- None of your business.

322
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:02,963
Is there a problem, Mathieu?

323
00:22:03,046 --> 00:22:05,131
No problem.

324
00:22:05,173 --> 00:22:07,091
It's just music.

325
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:08,801
What for?

326
00:22:09,719 --> 00:22:11,137
A chorus.

327
00:22:12,138 --> 00:22:14,056
In the water closets?

328
00:22:15,558 --> 00:22:17,935
Clear out, chorus.

329
00:22:23,231 --> 00:22:25,734
- Not here, Mathieu.
- What?

330
00:22:25,817 --> 00:22:28,403
- Don't play the idiot.
- You're not suggesting...?

331
00:22:28,444 --> 00:22:30,446
I won't say anything this time.

332
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:34,742
- You really see evil everywhere.
- In here? Yes.

333
00:22:41,873 --> 00:22:44,209
Baldy, you are through

334
00:22:44,251 --> 00:22:46,961
The rules won't be made by you

335
00:22:47,045 --> 00:22:49,422
Baldy, you are through

336
00:22:49,505 --> 00:22:51,799
The rules won't be made by you

337
00:23:07,438 --> 00:23:09,524
The rules won't be made by you

338
00:23:09,607 --> 00:23:11,859
Chickening out, guys?

339
00:23:13,652 --> 00:23:16,572
- You're Corbin.
- Yes, sir, but I didn't do anything.

340
00:23:16,655 --> 00:23:18,699
- You were singing.
- No, sir. I swear.

341
00:23:18,782 --> 00:23:22,661
You were singing. Badly.
And you couldn't even tell.

342
00:23:22,702 --> 00:23:24,162
Go on. Sing.

343
00:23:24,204 --> 00:23:26,664
I'm listening.

344
00:23:26,706 --> 00:23:30,001
Would you prefer to sing
for the headmaster? Go on.

345
00:23:30,084 --> 00:23:32,461
Chrome Dome
Prepare to meet your doom

346
00:23:33,504 --> 00:23:35,464
Chrome Dome
Prepare to meet your doom

347
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,758
You're not the boss of us

348
00:23:37,841 --> 00:23:40,177
You're not the boss of us

349
00:23:40,218 --> 00:23:42,471
No one ever told you
you couldn't sing?

350
00:23:42,554 --> 00:23:45,682
Sir? Is that really music
in your satchel?

351
00:23:45,765 --> 00:23:47,767
Mind your own business.

352
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:53,397
By the way, if I ever catch
one of you messing with my things...

353
00:23:54,899 --> 00:23:57,067
...he'll be very sorry.

354
00:23:57,109 --> 00:23:59,778
Now be quiet.
Time to go to bed. Hurry up.

355
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,279
It's over.

356
00:24:15,751 --> 00:24:17,669
Go to sleep.

357
00:24:35,352 --> 00:24:38,313
I couldn't get their ditty
out of my head.

358
00:24:38,397 --> 00:24:41,608
They're not very good at it,
but they are singing.

359
00:24:41,692 --> 00:24:44,444
I even spotted a few good voices.

360
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:48,990
Are those kids really a lost cause?

361
00:24:49,073 --> 00:24:51,993
And I had sworn never
to touch my music again.

362
00:24:53,661 --> 00:24:55,496
Never say never.

363
00:24:56,455 --> 00:24:59,208
Nothing is ever truly lost.

364
00:25:07,298 --> 00:25:09,008
January 23rd.

365
00:25:09,092 --> 00:25:13,012
One week after his accident, old Maxence
suddenly took a turn for the worse.

366
00:25:13,095 --> 00:25:15,681
The doctor sent him to the hospital.

367
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:23,063
Is he going to die?

368
00:25:24,022 --> 00:25:26,274
No, we'll save him.

369
00:25:28,484 --> 00:25:30,903
The very same day,
Ppinot got into trouble.

370
00:25:30,945 --> 00:25:33,864
Mr. Ppinot, you're a dunce.

371
00:25:33,948 --> 00:25:38,619
Final question. The last one.
How did Marshal Ney die?

372
00:25:47,168 --> 00:25:48,836
I'm waiting.

373
00:25:59,138 --> 00:26:00,347
Hunting?

374
00:26:02,307 --> 00:26:03,225
Zero.

375
00:26:03,308 --> 00:26:06,686
One hundred lines by tomorrow:
"Marshal Ney was shot."

376
00:26:07,645 --> 00:26:09,105
Get out.

377
00:26:17,112 --> 00:26:19,323
Boniface. Come here, boy.

378
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:25,328
Here, as a reward for your essay.

379
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,622
Give it to Mrs. Marie
and you'll get a cookie.

380
00:26:27,705 --> 00:26:30,583
You knew Ney had been shot, eh?

381
00:26:30,666 --> 00:26:32,627
Of course, sir. Just like Napoleon.

382
00:26:34,503 --> 00:26:35,880
Get out.

383
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:39,508
Hold on, Mr. Morhange.

384
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:41,551
I saw you taking notes during class.

385
00:26:41,593 --> 00:26:46,222
This is a rare occurrence indeed.
Bring me your notebook.

386
00:27:02,070 --> 00:27:03,155
Charming.

387
00:27:07,450 --> 00:27:10,620
Read it.
Admire the spelling.

388
00:27:16,292 --> 00:27:19,586
"Mr. Rachin eats shit by the bushel."

389
00:27:19,670 --> 00:27:21,213
He wrote "Mr.?"

390
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:23,548
No.

391
00:27:23,632 --> 00:27:26,468
Action-reaction, Mr. Mathieu.

392
00:27:26,551 --> 00:27:27,969
Lock-up.

393
00:27:33,432 --> 00:27:34,850
Come on.

394
00:27:55,828 --> 00:27:59,081
- Gentlemen, enjoy your meal.
- Thank you.

395
00:28:00,165 --> 00:28:02,167
Are you hungry, Ppinot?

396
00:28:07,547 --> 00:28:09,716
Now you can eat.

397
00:28:09,799 --> 00:28:11,175
Ppinot?

398
00:28:11,217 --> 00:28:12,551
He's an orphan.

399
00:28:12,593 --> 00:28:14,637
His parents died
during the Occupation.

400
00:28:15,638 --> 00:28:17,639
- How did they die?
- I don't know.

401
00:28:17,681 --> 00:28:20,684
The kid thinks his father
will come for him on a Saturday.

402
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:24,521
No one ever comes on Saturday.

403
00:28:24,604 --> 00:28:27,524
So we tell him he'll come
next Saturday, and so on.

404
00:28:27,607 --> 00:28:29,609
It'd be easier to tell him the truth.

405
00:28:29,650 --> 00:28:32,737
We must have told him 100 times.
He won't listen.

406
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,449
Now we let him wait by the gate.
Let him enjoy himself.

407
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:40,577
Be quiet!

408
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:45,081
Did you see that? Action-reaction.

409
00:28:45,165 --> 00:28:46,624
Meaning?

410
00:28:46,708 --> 00:28:48,167
Action.

411
00:28:48,209 --> 00:28:49,752
Reaction.

412
00:28:49,836 --> 00:28:52,380
There's a visitor for young Morhange.

413
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:54,298
Morhange is in lock-up.

414
00:28:54,381 --> 00:28:56,759
No visitors for the punished.
You know the rules.

415
00:28:56,842 --> 00:28:59,678
Go tell his visitor then.

416
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,827
Good day, madame.

417
00:29:25,910 --> 00:29:27,328
Good day.

418
00:29:27,370 --> 00:29:29,414
I'm the new prefect.

419
00:29:30,123 --> 00:29:31,999
I'm Pierre Morhange's mother.

420
00:29:32,083 --> 00:29:33,959
Clment Mathieu.

421
00:29:34,001 --> 00:29:37,921
I know this isn't the right day,
but it's the only time I could...

422
00:29:38,005 --> 00:29:41,299
- No, that's not the problem.
- Has he been punished again?

423
00:29:41,383 --> 00:29:43,802
No, nothing like that...

424
00:29:43,885 --> 00:29:46,179
...but he's not here.

425
00:29:46,221 --> 00:29:48,264
What do you mean?

426
00:29:48,348 --> 00:29:51,601
They took him to the dentist.
He had a toothache.

427
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:53,227
A toothache?

428
00:29:53,310 --> 00:29:56,897
Yes, but nothing serious.
He'll be back tonight.

429
00:29:57,981 --> 00:30:01,151
I can't wait.
I'm going back to work at 5.

430
00:30:02,152 --> 00:30:04,070
Can I leave something for him?

431
00:30:04,154 --> 00:30:06,114
Of course.

432
00:30:09,283 --> 00:30:12,995
Her name is Violette.
Violette Morhange.

433
00:30:13,037 --> 00:30:15,915
A single mother at her wits' end
about her son,

434
00:30:15,998 --> 00:30:20,961
a thieving introvert expelled from
school because he kept running away.

435
00:30:21,003 --> 00:30:25,006
When Pierre was sent to Fond de
I'tang against his mother's wishes,

436
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:29,802
she told the judge, "At least
he'll get a hot meal twice a day."

437
00:30:31,971 --> 00:30:34,223
January 30th. The experience begins.

438
00:30:34,515 --> 00:30:37,476
In Brittany, the hats are...

439
00:30:37,976 --> 00:30:41,188
In Brittany, the hats are round

440
00:30:41,271 --> 00:30:44,441
That's why I'm Brittany bound

441
00:30:44,482 --> 00:30:47,485
Soprano. Go left.

442
00:30:47,527 --> 00:30:49,153
Leclerc.

443
00:30:51,447 --> 00:30:56,035
He is born, the Holy Child
Let us greet His coming

444
00:30:56,118 --> 00:30:58,495
Almost in tune.
Alto, go left.

445
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:00,789
Delaire.

446
00:31:03,041 --> 00:31:06,419
Three miles on foot
What does it use?

447
00:31:06,503 --> 00:31:09,130
Three miles on foot
eats up your shoes

448
00:31:09,213 --> 00:31:10,631
Do it again.

449
00:31:10,715 --> 00:31:13,718
Four miles on foot
What does it use?

450
00:31:13,801 --> 00:31:16,178
Four miles on foot
eats up your shoes

451
00:31:16,262 --> 00:31:19,515
I was right. Bass, go right.

452
00:31:19,556 --> 00:31:21,016
Ricoeur.

453
00:31:23,393 --> 00:31:27,188
I've got tobacco in my pouch

454
00:31:27,230 --> 00:31:29,148
I'll give it away, not today

455
00:31:29,232 --> 00:31:32,109
Smoking is strictly forbidden.
Alto, left.

456
00:31:33,069 --> 00:31:34,612
Illouz.

457
00:31:37,698 --> 00:31:40,492
Love is a gypsy child

458
00:31:40,575 --> 00:31:43,411
That obeys no one's laws

459
00:31:43,453 --> 00:31:46,664
Soprano, of course. Left.

460
00:31:46,748 --> 00:31:48,875
Very well. Ppinot.

461
00:31:52,545 --> 00:31:54,422
I don't know any songs.

462
00:31:54,505 --> 00:31:56,757
That's fine. I'll teach you some.

463
00:31:58,175 --> 00:32:02,220
In the meantime,
you can be Assistant Chorus Master.

464
00:32:04,472 --> 00:32:05,724
Over there.

465
00:32:08,601 --> 00:32:11,187
Boniface.

466
00:32:12,938 --> 00:32:15,941
Marshal Ptain, here we are

467
00:32:16,025 --> 00:32:19,278
- Who taught you that?
- My grandfather.

468
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,655
A little old-fashioned. Left.

469
00:32:22,531 --> 00:32:23,657
Clment.

470
00:32:25,992 --> 00:32:29,495
Citizens to arms
Display your charms

471
00:32:29,579 --> 00:32:30,955
Enough. Right.

472
00:32:30,997 --> 00:32:33,040
My camp counselor's a jerk

473
00:32:33,082 --> 00:32:35,793
He doesn't do any work

474
00:32:35,834 --> 00:32:36,877
Go left.

475
00:32:36,919 --> 00:32:39,922
Cuckoo, booboo
Cuckoo, booboo

476
00:32:43,175 --> 00:32:44,509
Good. Alto.

477
00:32:55,060 --> 00:32:57,062
Strong beat.

478
00:32:57,146 --> 00:32:58,856
Strong beat.

479
00:33:11,826 --> 00:33:13,661
Show me, Corbin.

480
00:33:20,876 --> 00:33:23,837
Sorry, there's no such note.
Come here.

481
00:33:24,879 --> 00:33:27,215
Mr. Ppinot, hand me the score.

482
00:33:27,674 --> 00:33:30,384
Thank you. Open your hands.

483
00:33:30,468 --> 00:33:32,970
Hold them like this.

484
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,930
Good. You can be our lectern.

485
00:33:36,849 --> 00:33:38,475
Baton, Mr. Ppinot.

486
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,061
Thank you.

487
00:33:43,021 --> 00:33:44,898
Get ready. On three...

488
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:53,155
Again.

489
00:33:57,242 --> 00:33:58,702
That's it.

490
00:33:58,785 --> 00:34:00,454
One, two, three, four.

491
00:34:00,537 --> 00:34:03,540
Le Querrec's on bread and water...

492
00:34:03,623 --> 00:34:06,709
Every night, I make them practice
a simple tune of my own.

493
00:34:06,793 --> 00:34:09,796
Carpentier has lost his way

494
00:34:09,837 --> 00:34:13,507
Fond de I'Etang is where
we're stuck, just our luck

495
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:17,177
Fond de I'Etang is where we'll be
for all eternity

496
00:34:25,643 --> 00:34:27,437
Not bad.

497
00:34:27,478 --> 00:34:30,356
It wasn't Mozart,
but I had their attention now.

498
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:34,026
From now on, I would need
the support of my superiors.

499
00:34:34,068 --> 00:34:36,487
What?

500
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:38,405
A chorus?

501
00:34:38,489 --> 00:34:39,656
Yes.

502
00:34:39,740 --> 00:34:43,535
My poor man, you've completely lost it.

503
00:34:43,577 --> 00:34:47,205
A chorus. You won't get a single note
from them or I'm the biggest fool...

504
00:34:47,247 --> 00:34:49,791
Please, Headmaster,
don't finish your sentence.

505
00:34:49,832 --> 00:34:51,500
Why not?

506
00:34:51,584 --> 00:34:53,419
They're singing already.

507
00:34:53,502 --> 00:34:54,920
Really?

508
00:34:54,962 --> 00:34:56,380
Just a few notes.

509
00:34:56,422 --> 00:34:59,883
Why ask my permission
if you're already doing it?

510
00:34:59,967 --> 00:35:01,885
I don't like your manners.

511
00:35:01,968 --> 00:35:04,471
- Headmaster...
- You're annoying me.

512
00:35:04,554 --> 00:35:06,598
I have other things on my mind.

513
00:35:06,681 --> 00:35:09,892
Very well. I enjoy a good laugh.

514
00:35:09,934 --> 00:35:11,811
Make them sing.

515
00:35:11,852 --> 00:35:15,064
But if everything goes sour,
you'll lose your job.

516
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:20,861
Thank you for your support, Headmaster.

517
00:35:25,573 --> 00:35:27,158
February 8th.

518
00:35:27,242 --> 00:35:30,578
As we begin rehearsals,
Rachin starts on Morhange.

519
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:33,289
As soon as he's out of lock-up,
he lowers the axe:

520
00:35:33,372 --> 00:35:35,332
one month of community work.

521
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:37,626
From the beginning. Get ready.

522
00:35:58,854 --> 00:36:01,189
Hey, skivvy. Don't forget my bed.

523
00:36:35,512 --> 00:36:37,014
February 15th.

524
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:39,766
We're visited by Dr. Dervaux,
a psychiatrist.

525
00:36:39,808 --> 00:36:41,977
He brought us a gift.

526
00:36:42,018 --> 00:36:46,272
We've decided to take this boy
out of St. Frol Reformatory

527
00:36:46,314 --> 00:36:51,527
to study his capacity to adapt
to a... more liberal environment.

528
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,155
Unlike most of his classmates,

529
00:36:54,238 --> 00:36:56,365
Pascal Mondain has begun
to read and write.

530
00:36:56,448 --> 00:36:59,618
At any rate, he can speak
more or less normally.

531
00:36:59,701 --> 00:37:02,621
We assessed his potential
with the Binet-Simon Test.

532
00:37:02,704 --> 00:37:04,623
The Binet-Simon.

533
00:37:04,664 --> 00:37:07,542
We also administered
the Rorschach and Drss Fables.

534
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,961
- Excellent.
- As you know, this test...

535
00:37:10,044 --> 00:37:12,880
That test sorted children
into seven different categories:

536
00:37:12,963 --> 00:37:14,298
normal, adequate,

537
00:37:14,381 --> 00:37:17,676
borderline, mildly,
moderately or severely retarded.

538
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:19,720
And finally, imbeciles.

539
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:24,224
Mondain scored
within the borderline zone.

540
00:37:24,307 --> 00:37:27,393
He isn't actually mad,
but I should warn you...

541
00:37:28,436 --> 00:37:31,856
According to his profile,
he's a gregarious pervert.

542
00:37:34,024 --> 00:37:35,693
Interesting.

543
00:37:35,734 --> 00:37:37,111
And what does that mean?

544
00:37:38,153 --> 00:37:40,238
Well...

545
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:43,033
- Doctor?
- A tendency to be cruel, parasitic,

546
00:37:43,074 --> 00:37:47,245
destructive and above all...
Above all, a mythomaniac.

547
00:37:47,287 --> 00:37:50,414
- There you go.
- The place is full of them.

548
00:37:50,498 --> 00:37:53,501
Here the children face
non-specialized methods of discipline.

549
00:37:53,584 --> 00:37:56,211
Mondain's integration will provide
a good case study.

550
00:37:57,838 --> 00:37:59,673
Happy to oblige.

551
00:37:59,756 --> 00:38:02,551
We'll try to meet
your scientific requirements.

552
00:38:02,592 --> 00:38:04,719
Gentleman, this fellow is in your hands.

553
00:38:04,803 --> 00:38:06,888
- Will you stay for lunch?
- Gladly.

554
00:38:06,971 --> 00:38:08,848
Take good care of him.

555
00:38:08,931 --> 00:38:10,808
Action-reaction.

556
00:38:20,025 --> 00:38:21,985
You're not allowed to smoke.

557
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:26,573
For the experience to succeed,
I had to get the upper hand.

558
00:38:31,702 --> 00:38:34,121
You really look like an idiot.

559
00:38:35,122 --> 00:38:37,750
You'd better behave
or you'll get what's coming to you.

560
00:38:39,001 --> 00:38:40,335
All right.

561
00:38:45,590 --> 00:38:47,091
What's coming?

562
00:38:52,430 --> 00:38:54,390
You probably know a song, right?

563
00:38:55,724 --> 00:38:57,601
Yeah, but...

564
00:38:57,684 --> 00:38:59,102
But?

565
00:38:59,186 --> 00:39:01,104
You won't like it.

566
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:05,275
Why don't you try me? Come here.

567
00:39:05,358 --> 00:39:06,276
Come on.

568
00:39:11,989 --> 00:39:13,449
I'm listening.

569
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:17,161
One summer day
I took out my knob

570
00:39:17,202 --> 00:39:19,538
To give myself a nice hand job

571
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:21,331
- All right.
- Up yours I go

572
00:39:21,415 --> 00:39:22,582
All right.

573
00:39:23,625 --> 00:39:26,252
Told you so.

574
00:39:26,294 --> 00:39:27,712
Not bad.

575
00:39:27,795 --> 00:39:30,423
You'll need to practice,
but you have a good baritone.

576
00:39:30,506 --> 00:39:31,549
What?

577
00:39:31,632 --> 00:39:33,968
Baritone. It's not an insult.

578
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:36,512
When you sing,
your voice is low-pitched.

579
00:39:36,553 --> 00:39:38,931
Go to the back with the basses.

580
00:39:41,099 --> 00:39:44,019
- Fuck.
- And forget about the fucking.

581
00:39:44,102 --> 00:39:45,895
Next one to laugh gets punched out.

582
00:39:45,937 --> 00:39:48,356
Whenever you're ready, Mondain.

583
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:53,194
He's allowed back in class.

584
00:39:53,235 --> 00:39:56,071
And here's Ppinot.
You forgot him by the gate.

585
00:39:57,322 --> 00:39:59,408
What's wrong, Ppinot?
It's not Saturday.

586
00:40:01,076 --> 00:40:02,744
By the way,

587
00:40:02,828 --> 00:40:05,622
when you write to your family...

588
00:40:05,705 --> 00:40:07,457
I don't have any.

589
00:40:07,498 --> 00:40:09,625
Well, for those who do,

590
00:40:09,709 --> 00:40:13,462
remind them that visits are on the
first and third Thursday of the month.

591
00:40:13,546 --> 00:40:15,548
Morhange, you're not paying attention.

592
00:40:15,589 --> 00:40:18,759
- What did I just say?
- I don't know.

593
00:40:18,801 --> 00:40:22,179
I said, you could write your mother
telling her that she can see you

594
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:25,557
on the first or third Thursday
of the month. Or even both days.

595
00:40:25,640 --> 00:40:28,851
Understood? But the punished
can't have visitors, so be careful.

596
00:40:28,935 --> 00:40:30,770
I don't want to see the old goats.

597
00:40:30,853 --> 00:40:32,647
Maybe Morhange
wants to see his mother.

598
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:34,857
Maybe he's not the only one.

599
00:40:37,276 --> 00:40:39,945
See, Morhange?
We have a real chorus.

600
00:40:40,028 --> 00:40:42,447
- I don't care.
- Why don't you care?

601
00:40:42,531 --> 00:40:45,283
Let's hear your voice.
Sing for me. Do...

602
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:47,869
Go ahead.

603
00:40:47,911 --> 00:40:50,663
You want to go back?
Your range, quickly.

604
00:40:56,043 --> 00:40:59,004
Coarseness doesn't suit you, kid.

605
00:40:59,046 --> 00:41:01,631
We can't all be like Mondain.

606
00:41:01,673 --> 00:41:03,800
All right.
From the top.

607
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,012
- Where are you going?
- I need to pee.

608
00:41:08,096 --> 00:41:09,514
Mondain, wait.

609
00:41:10,723 --> 00:41:13,017
- Corbin.
- Can I go pee too, sir?

610
00:41:14,477 --> 00:41:16,395
Fine, everyone out.

611
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,782
And be quiet. Quiet.

612
00:41:50,468 --> 00:41:52,720
You have a nice voice, beautiful.

613
00:41:55,055 --> 00:41:56,932
Want a drag?

614
00:41:57,558 --> 00:41:59,685
They left you all alone?

615
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,603
I'll protect you.

616
00:42:03,355 --> 00:42:04,981
Wait for me.

617
00:42:05,023 --> 00:42:06,691
We're the same.

618
00:42:06,774 --> 00:42:09,235
My parents are a couple of buggers.

619
00:42:10,236 --> 00:42:12,613
Your mother's the same.

620
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,949
She got rid of you to have some fun.

621
00:42:15,032 --> 00:42:16,450
No, she's working.

622
00:42:16,533 --> 00:42:19,703
- So the others are telling the truth?
- What?

623
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:22,664
They say she's a whore.

624
00:42:25,542 --> 00:42:26,876
I'll rearrange your face.

625
00:42:26,960 --> 00:42:28,544
Get out.

626
00:42:30,922 --> 00:42:32,840
You're a dead man.

627
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:34,341
Really?

628
00:42:45,185 --> 00:42:48,313
That day, Morhange
missed the 3:00 roll call.

629
00:43:25,638 --> 00:43:29,142
No one ever knew where he went,
but he'd come back.

630
00:43:29,225 --> 00:43:31,435
That was the important part.

631
00:43:33,938 --> 00:43:36,148
What are you doing there?

632
00:43:40,944 --> 00:43:43,029
I can't go up.

633
00:43:43,113 --> 00:43:46,282
What do you mean,
you can't go up?

634
00:43:47,283 --> 00:43:49,243
Why not?

635
00:43:49,327 --> 00:43:50,912
I have no money.

636
00:43:50,995 --> 00:43:53,581
You need money to sleep?
That doesn't make sense.

637
00:43:55,082 --> 00:43:56,667
It's Mondain.

638
00:43:56,750 --> 00:44:00,504
He won't let me come up
unless I give him money.

639
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:07,552
We have to be careful.

640
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:12,973
At my last place,
the prefect caught me.

641
00:44:13,015 --> 00:44:16,143
- So I had to take care of him.
- How?

642
00:44:16,185 --> 00:44:19,563
With a bayonet. He bled like a pig.

643
00:44:19,646 --> 00:44:21,982
- You killed him?
- Kind of, yeah.

644
00:44:22,065 --> 00:44:25,193
It's no different here.
Chrome Dome had better watch out.

645
00:44:25,276 --> 00:44:27,528
- Mathieu isn't so bad.
- Yeah, right.

646
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,907
They sing you a lullaby and when
you're asleep, they start pawing you.

647
00:44:30,990 --> 00:44:33,159
We've got to kill their kind.

648
00:44:35,369 --> 00:44:37,162
Good evening, gentlemen.

649
00:44:40,916 --> 00:44:43,752
- Enjoy your meal.
- Sir, I swear I didn't do anything.

650
00:44:43,835 --> 00:44:46,421
You keep good company, Corbin.

651
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,091
Get out.

652
00:44:57,473 --> 00:44:59,433
Forget about the feast.

653
00:44:59,516 --> 00:45:01,977
I won't tell on you. A gift.

654
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:05,855
But I'm warning you:
don't speak to Ppinot again.

655
00:45:05,939 --> 00:45:09,525
Don't go near him.
Don't even look at him.

656
00:45:09,609 --> 00:45:11,694
Do you understand?

657
00:45:12,737 --> 00:45:16,949
One look in his direction, and
your life will turn into a nightmare.

658
00:45:23,163 --> 00:45:25,498
See on your way

659
00:45:25,582 --> 00:45:28,876
Forgotten kids who've strayed

660
00:45:28,918 --> 00:45:30,878
Give them a helping hand

661
00:45:30,962 --> 00:45:35,966
Lead them to new horizons
Help them understand

662
00:45:36,008 --> 00:45:40,262
Feel, in the depths of despair

663
00:45:41,722 --> 00:45:44,224
A surging wave of hope

664
00:45:44,307 --> 00:45:47,852
The fervor of life

665
00:45:47,936 --> 00:45:50,354
The glorious path

666
00:45:52,690 --> 00:45:55,025
What are you doing, Morhange?

667
00:45:55,109 --> 00:45:56,777
Nothing, sir.

668
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,113
So I heard voices?
I must be tired.

669
00:46:01,990 --> 00:46:04,034
Section 8 of the interior rules:

670
00:46:04,117 --> 00:46:07,287
Students will not enter
a classroom without supervision.

671
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,206
Mr. Rachin would make you do
100 lines by tomorrow morning.

672
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:12,833
And who knows
what he'd tell your mother.

673
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:15,169
I don't give a damn about my mother.

674
00:46:15,252 --> 00:46:17,212
- Why? Tell me.
- I'll tell you nothing.

675
00:46:17,296 --> 00:46:19,840
Wait. I'm not through.
That's a little too easy.

676
00:46:19,923 --> 00:46:22,759
You pay for everything here.
Ask Ppinot.

677
00:46:23,718 --> 00:46:27,222
Morhange, strangely enough,
the things you do don't resemble you.

678
00:46:27,263 --> 00:46:30,141
Running away, fighting,
pretending to be a hoodlum.

679
00:46:30,224 --> 00:46:33,936
Your classmates may laugh,
but I won't. I'm not playing along.

680
00:46:34,019 --> 00:46:38,148
Starting tomorrow, you will attend
every chorus practice

681
00:46:38,232 --> 00:46:41,360
and take a music lesson every day.
Go to bed now.

682
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:43,820
Go on.

683
00:46:45,447 --> 00:46:46,948
March 3rd.

684
00:46:47,031 --> 00:46:50,618
He can't possibly know, but I do.
His voice is a miracle.

685
00:46:50,701 --> 00:46:53,079
The rare promise of an exceptional gift.

686
00:46:53,162 --> 00:46:55,039
Please go out quietly.

687
00:46:58,292 --> 00:46:59,960
I said quietly.

688
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:03,588
Gradually, as my chorus takes shape,

689
00:47:03,672 --> 00:47:06,049
I bring my new singer
out of his shell.

690
00:47:22,606 --> 00:47:25,066
Childish delights

691
00:47:25,150 --> 00:47:27,986
Too soon forgotten and erased

692
00:47:28,069 --> 00:47:30,863
A golden light that burns forever

693
00:47:30,905 --> 00:47:33,657
At the end of the path

694
00:47:39,788 --> 00:47:43,083
Feel, in the depths of despair

695
00:47:43,166 --> 00:47:44,918
A surging wave of hope

696
00:47:44,959 --> 00:47:47,921
The fervor of life

697
00:47:48,004 --> 00:47:50,506
The glorious path

698
00:48:26,080 --> 00:48:28,249
Get your arithmetic notebooks.

699
00:48:32,253 --> 00:48:35,548
You're the one making them sing?

700
00:48:35,631 --> 00:48:37,049
Yes, sir.

701
00:48:37,132 --> 00:48:39,509
- Is that a criticism?
- Of course not.

702
00:48:39,593 --> 00:48:43,555
I adore music.
Occasionally I even sing a little.

703
00:48:43,638 --> 00:48:44,556
Really?

704
00:48:44,639 --> 00:48:47,016
Why are we waiting?
Let's get happy

705
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:50,520
Why are we waiting?
Let's have a ball

706
00:48:54,690 --> 00:48:57,443
- Have a nice day.
- You too, dear colleague.

707
00:48:59,152 --> 00:49:02,030
Arithmetic. Page 27.

708
00:49:33,392 --> 00:49:35,644
Good day.

709
00:49:35,728 --> 00:49:37,563
Good day, madame.

710
00:49:37,646 --> 00:49:40,315
- Pierre has been told. He's coming.
- Is something wrong?

711
00:49:40,399 --> 00:49:42,442
Everything's fine.

712
00:49:42,526 --> 00:49:45,612
- What about his teeth?
- Not a problem anymore.

713
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:48,364
Did you tell him I came for a visit?

714
00:49:48,448 --> 00:49:49,866
No.

715
00:49:49,907 --> 00:49:51,534
Why not?

716
00:49:51,617 --> 00:49:55,913
I thought I'd better not.
Pierre is very sensitive...

717
00:49:55,955 --> 00:49:57,414
...and gifted.

718
00:49:57,456 --> 00:49:59,625
At acting like an idiot, yes.

719
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:04,629
Not exclusively. By the way,
I need to talk to you.

720
00:50:05,463 --> 00:50:08,007
Singing? No one taught him.

721
00:50:08,049 --> 00:50:10,510
It's a gift.
We have to do something.

722
00:50:12,803 --> 00:50:14,305
Hello.

723
00:50:15,639 --> 00:50:19,184
I'll leave you two alone.
Visit him whenever you like.

724
00:50:22,187 --> 00:50:24,731
I told her you went
to the dentist last time.

725
00:50:24,814 --> 00:50:26,691
Don't give me away.

726
00:50:50,046 --> 00:50:52,423
- So you're a good singer?
- Yeah.

727
00:50:56,260 --> 00:50:59,179
That man seems
to think you're doing well.

728
00:50:59,263 --> 00:51:01,765
Is he nice to you?

729
00:51:01,848 --> 00:51:03,266
He's all right.

730
00:51:06,311 --> 00:51:08,688
I brought you some clean clothes

731
00:51:08,771 --> 00:51:11,315
and I made your chocolate cake.

732
00:51:12,441 --> 00:51:14,360
Are you happy?

733
00:51:23,785 --> 00:51:26,204
April. Those children inspire me.

734
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:29,791
I knew that one day,
someone would play my music.

735
00:51:29,874 --> 00:51:31,667
My name is Clment Mathieu.

736
00:51:31,751 --> 00:51:35,129
I'm a musician and each night,
I compose for them.

737
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:19,544
Like a caress on the ocean

738
00:52:20,253 --> 00:52:26,009
Lightly lands the gull

739
00:52:26,593 --> 00:52:32,306
On the rocks of a sunken isle

740
00:52:35,517 --> 00:52:41,273
Ephemeral winter breeze

741
00:52:42,274 --> 00:52:47,987
At last your cold breath fades away

742
00:52:48,988 --> 00:52:53,367
Far into the mountains high

743
00:52:53,451 --> 00:52:56,537
Face the wind
and spread your wings

744
00:52:56,578 --> 00:52:58,997
In the gray eastern dawn

745
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:01,541
Find a path to the rainbow

746
00:53:01,625 --> 00:53:04,919
And spring will reveal
itself to you

747
00:53:05,003 --> 00:53:07,922
Calmly

748
00:53:07,964 --> 00:53:13,719
On the ocean

749
00:53:19,016 --> 00:53:20,434
No good, sir?

750
00:53:20,517 --> 00:53:23,019
It was nice.

751
00:53:23,103 --> 00:53:24,688
Very nice.

752
00:53:24,729 --> 00:53:26,856
Move, you swine.

753
00:53:26,940 --> 00:53:28,566
Little shit. Move.

754
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,067
Move.

755
00:53:30,151 --> 00:53:32,820
- What did he do?
- He stole my watch.

756
00:53:32,903 --> 00:53:35,739
I caught him in my bedroom.
So I brought him to Rachin.

757
00:53:35,823 --> 00:53:37,241
Action-reaction.

758
00:53:37,282 --> 00:53:40,077
- Where are you taking him?
- Lock-up. Fifteen days. Move.

759
00:53:40,118 --> 00:53:41,995
- Wait.
- Wait for what?

760
00:53:42,996 --> 00:53:44,914
He's my only baritone.

761
00:53:50,044 --> 00:53:51,629
Yes, Headmaster?

762
00:53:51,712 --> 00:53:53,631
I found more graffiti in the...

763
00:53:56,759 --> 00:53:59,553
Forgive them, Headmaster.
It's just a wild ball.

764
00:54:01,471 --> 00:54:03,098
Make way.

765
00:54:04,057 --> 00:54:06,559
Mathieu, Chabert...

766
00:54:08,728 --> 00:54:10,605
...you're with me.

767
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:16,902
May. With each passing week,
I take in new victories.

768
00:54:16,944 --> 00:54:19,404
Wake-up time. Get up.

769
00:54:27,537 --> 00:54:28,996
- Leclerc.
- Yeah?

770
00:54:29,080 --> 00:54:30,915
- We're still friends?
- Yeah, why?

771
00:54:30,998 --> 00:54:32,375
Five and three add up to what?

772
00:54:32,458 --> 00:54:34,543
- Fifty-three.
- Are you sure?

773
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:36,420
- Yeah.
- Thanks.

774
00:54:55,646 --> 00:54:57,731
Perhaps it's an illusion,

775
00:54:57,815 --> 00:55:00,859
but even our headmaster
seems to be changing.

776
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:43,607
Five.

777
00:55:47,318 --> 00:55:49,695
Look, it's old Maxence.

778
00:55:59,413 --> 00:56:01,206
Nobody move.

779
00:56:02,666 --> 00:56:04,209
Smile.

780
00:56:09,797 --> 00:56:12,174
Come on. Come out, Mondain.

781
00:56:21,558 --> 00:56:24,311
It's over, kid.

782
00:56:32,485 --> 00:56:34,820
Come on. One, two...

783
00:56:40,742 --> 00:56:45,038
Chabert, I just told Mr. Rachin
that Mathieu's chorus is sensational.

784
00:56:45,121 --> 00:56:46,706
Hurry up.

785
00:56:46,789 --> 00:56:49,417
- I'm tired.
- You're always tired. 29.

786
00:56:49,500 --> 00:56:52,670
- What did he say?
- "Get lost." That's it.

787
00:56:53,671 --> 00:56:55,631
Where's Mondain?

788
00:56:57,591 --> 00:56:59,885
You didn't notice
he was gone before the run?

789
00:56:59,968 --> 00:57:02,971
He attended roll call this morning,
Headmaster. He left later.

790
00:57:03,054 --> 00:57:05,390
No one goes out
for the rest of the year.

791
00:57:05,473 --> 00:57:08,226
- How much did he take?
- Almost 200,000 francs.

792
00:57:08,309 --> 00:57:10,520
How will I pay our suppliers?

793
00:57:10,561 --> 00:57:13,064
I should never have taken him.

794
00:57:13,147 --> 00:57:16,025
All for the sake of an experience.
Experience my...

795
00:57:16,066 --> 00:57:18,777
Just like your music.

796
00:57:21,780 --> 00:57:24,407
I won't order coal
for the boiler until next week.

797
00:57:24,449 --> 00:57:26,784
In the meantime, I'm calling the police.

798
00:57:27,577 --> 00:57:29,495
When Rachin in his coffin lay

799
00:57:29,537 --> 00:57:31,956
His cock was hard, they say

800
00:57:31,998 --> 00:57:35,125
His cock was his last bid
to lift up the coffin lid

801
00:57:35,167 --> 00:57:38,879
Yes, indeed, he's a funny breed

802
00:57:47,637 --> 00:57:50,181
Singing is really developing
their minds, Mathieu.

803
00:57:50,264 --> 00:57:52,183
Very impressive.

804
00:57:52,224 --> 00:57:54,518
They've spent three weeks
without hot water.

805
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,979
Cold water activates
the circulation. Get out.

806
00:57:59,398 --> 00:58:01,983
By the way, Mathieu,
forget the chorus.

807
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:07,071
- But, Headmaster...
- Thank you, Mr. Mathieu.

808
00:58:07,155 --> 00:58:09,198
Give me the police.

809
00:58:17,456 --> 00:58:19,249
I don't know what to do
about the chorus,

810
00:58:19,291 --> 00:58:22,377
but for the kids,
we can use wood.

811
00:58:22,460 --> 00:58:24,337
We're out of wood.

812
00:58:29,217 --> 00:58:30,885
Here.

813
00:58:30,968 --> 00:58:33,804
The headmaster's private stock.

814
00:58:33,888 --> 00:58:36,307
Chabert. Action-reaction.

815
00:58:36,390 --> 00:58:37,683
Chabert surprised me.

816
00:58:37,724 --> 00:58:39,893
I used to think he was
Rachin's zealous double,

817
00:58:39,977 --> 00:58:42,771
but I discovered
that he was a nice guy

818
00:58:42,812 --> 00:58:46,191
for whom sports and music were
the key elements of national unity.

819
00:58:46,274 --> 00:58:48,026
Le Querrec, are you invisible?

820
00:58:48,109 --> 00:58:51,237
With his help,
I'm organizing the resistance.

821
00:58:52,196 --> 00:58:54,657
Our chorus is going underground.

822
00:59:17,845 --> 00:59:20,722
You tend to lower your pitch
at the end of a verse.

823
00:59:20,806 --> 00:59:23,350
For the last time,
please detach every single note.

824
00:59:23,892 --> 00:59:25,810
It's late. Let's stop.

825
00:59:25,894 --> 00:59:28,438
Sir, what about the second part?

826
00:59:28,521 --> 00:59:30,898
- I didn't teach you the solo.
- I learned it.

827
00:59:30,940 --> 00:59:33,067
How could you learn it?

828
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:38,697
All right. Second part.

829
01:00:18,817 --> 01:00:20,360
Get out.

830
01:00:21,862 --> 01:00:26,658
On May 13, just after 3:00,
Mondain came back.

831
01:00:39,127 --> 01:00:41,046
- Where's the money?
- I don't know.

832
01:00:41,129 --> 01:00:43,048
- So who stole it?
- It wasn't me.

833
01:00:44,841 --> 01:00:46,759
Do you want more?

834
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:47,802
So?

835
01:00:48,928 --> 01:00:51,389
- He's been hitting him?
- For half an hour.

836
01:00:51,472 --> 01:00:53,891
- He's crazy.
- And he's wasting his time.

837
01:00:53,933 --> 01:00:55,684
The boy won't talk.

838
01:00:57,728 --> 01:01:00,188
Very well.

839
01:01:00,272 --> 01:01:02,691
Let's start from the beginning.

840
01:01:02,732 --> 01:01:05,151
Where's the money?

841
01:01:05,235 --> 01:01:06,361
Speak!

842
01:01:08,821 --> 01:01:10,615
Where's the money?

843
01:01:13,534 --> 01:01:14,994
Let him go!

844
01:01:16,036 --> 01:01:17,454
Let him go.

845
01:01:20,415 --> 01:01:22,000
Calm down.

846
01:01:22,083 --> 01:01:23,877
Calm down!

847
01:01:25,003 --> 01:01:28,131
The boy just confessed. Excellent.
I'm calling the police.

848
01:01:29,006 --> 01:01:31,550
You're going to see
new horizons, my boy.

849
01:01:31,634 --> 01:01:34,011
With new guards and brand-new bars.

850
01:01:52,862 --> 01:01:55,614
In order to spare
the children's fragile trust,

851
01:01:55,656 --> 01:01:58,408
we hid Mondain's fate from them.

852
01:02:00,077 --> 01:02:03,455
Officially, he had gone back
to his old school.

853
01:02:04,581 --> 01:02:06,666
One hen

854
01:02:06,749 --> 01:02:09,502
produces an average...

855
01:02:10,920 --> 01:02:14,757
...of 84 eggs a year.

856
01:02:16,342 --> 01:02:18,802
Well-fed...

857
01:02:20,137 --> 01:02:22,931
...and kept...
- I saw Rachin's daughters today.

858
01:02:23,014 --> 01:02:24,057
Naked?

859
01:02:24,099 --> 01:02:25,975
- No.
...inside a well-ventilated...

860
01:02:26,017 --> 01:02:31,022
...and clean henhouse,
the same hen will lay 150 eggs.

861
01:02:32,064 --> 01:02:37,820
Under such conditions,
how many more eggs could...

862
01:02:37,861 --> 01:02:43,074
...a farmer get...

863
01:02:43,116 --> 01:02:45,118
...out of her nine hens?

864
01:02:59,423 --> 01:03:01,216
Nice day.

865
01:03:02,300 --> 01:03:05,678
It's nice to feel the sun.
Summer will soon be here.

866
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:12,685
Pierre is a constant source
of surprise to me.

867
01:03:12,768 --> 01:03:15,896
I wanted to thank you for helping him.

868
01:03:15,938 --> 01:03:18,941
I'm doing it for you too.

869
01:03:19,024 --> 01:03:21,943
I mean, if Pierre is doing well,
you're doing well, so...

870
01:03:26,114 --> 01:03:28,032
- Let me.
- It's nothing.

871
01:03:29,409 --> 01:03:30,618
It's only ink.

872
01:03:30,660 --> 01:03:34,455
- Why are you such an ass?
- You want to send us to lock-up?

873
01:03:34,538 --> 01:03:36,874
What's going on?

874
01:03:38,458 --> 01:03:40,502
Why are you hitting him?

875
01:03:41,503 --> 01:03:42,963
Tell me, Bbert.

876
01:03:43,004 --> 01:03:45,840
Because Morhange threw the ink.

877
01:03:46,174 --> 01:03:49,177
You couldn't just shut up?

878
01:03:49,260 --> 01:03:51,512
I'm ashamed of you, Pierre.

879
01:03:53,973 --> 01:03:55,891
Wait.

880
01:03:55,933 --> 01:03:58,644
It doesn't matter. It's only ink.

881
01:03:59,645 --> 01:04:02,355
It's just pride
because you're beautiful.

882
01:04:02,439 --> 01:04:03,440
Beautiful?

883
01:04:03,481 --> 01:04:06,609
You're nothing like
the other mothers who come here.

884
01:04:06,693 --> 01:04:08,611
Because I live alone?

885
01:04:08,695 --> 01:04:10,363
So do I.

886
01:04:10,446 --> 01:04:12,698
- But you have no children.
- No.

887
01:04:12,782 --> 01:04:14,700
In fact, I've got 60 kids.

888
01:04:14,742 --> 01:04:17,911
When you come here,
they see the woman of their dreams.

889
01:04:17,995 --> 01:04:21,206
Well, the mother
they've all imagined.

890
01:04:21,248 --> 01:04:23,583
It's different for Pierre.
You are his mother.

891
01:04:23,667 --> 01:04:26,961
Like any other child,
he doesn't like to share.

892
01:04:27,003 --> 01:04:28,921
We have to get him out of there.

893
01:04:29,005 --> 01:04:33,342
- He should go to music school.
- I want him to learn a good trade.

894
01:04:33,426 --> 01:04:37,012
Music is a good trade,
as long as you've been well taught.

895
01:04:37,096 --> 01:04:39,348
He could go to the Conservatory in Lyon.

896
01:04:39,431 --> 01:04:41,767
I'd follow his progress
to prevent any bad habits.

897
01:04:41,850 --> 01:04:44,227
Even there, he could meet
mediocre teachers.

898
01:04:44,311 --> 01:04:45,728
And later?

899
01:04:45,812 --> 01:04:48,398
He'll become who he should be.

900
01:04:50,316 --> 01:04:54,361
Pierre is special, and I'll do anything
to help him achieve his dreams.

901
01:04:54,445 --> 01:04:56,363
I need your help too.

902
01:04:56,405 --> 01:04:58,282
I understand.

903
01:04:58,323 --> 01:04:59,783
Thank you.

904
01:05:23,471 --> 01:05:25,014
No, it's all wrong.

905
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:27,475
What's the matter?
Are you asleep?

906
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:29,310
Boniface, your posture.

907
01:05:29,394 --> 01:05:31,979
How can you sing that way?
Stand up straight.

908
01:05:33,022 --> 01:05:35,649
From "Such a sweet concert".

909
01:06:08,971 --> 01:06:10,806
What about my solo?

910
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,308
What solo?

911
01:06:12,391 --> 01:06:13,642
My solo.

912
01:06:13,726 --> 01:06:16,145
Your solo, right. It's gone.

913
01:06:16,228 --> 01:06:18,897
Your voice isn't bad,
but nobody's indispensable.

914
01:06:18,981 --> 01:06:22,609
I don't care if you sing or not.
We can do it without you. Listen.

915
01:06:23,902 --> 01:06:25,612
Start from...

916
01:06:28,698 --> 01:06:31,367
Let's start from O night.

917
01:06:32,326 --> 01:06:35,704
O Night

918
01:06:35,788 --> 01:06:39,875
Bring to

919
01:06:39,916 --> 01:06:42,752
The Earth

920
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:47,465
The enchanting calm

921
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:51,219
Of your mystery

922
01:06:51,302 --> 01:06:53,262
Mathieu.

923
01:06:53,345 --> 01:06:56,390
- You're going to get it, sir.
- Mr. Chabert said he was in town.

924
01:06:56,473 --> 01:06:58,892
Thank you, children.
You can go outside.

925
01:07:07,317 --> 01:07:09,694
You do know that you're
annoying me?

926
01:07:09,777 --> 01:07:12,655
Headmaster, I assure you,
all their homework is done.

927
01:07:12,738 --> 01:07:15,616
Our lady benefactresses
heard about your chorus.

928
01:07:15,699 --> 01:07:19,786
A personal letter from the Countess.
She's coming on Sunday, with friends.

929
01:07:19,870 --> 01:07:21,705
- They want to hear this.
- Wonderful.

930
01:07:21,788 --> 01:07:23,873
Well, it's nice.

931
01:07:23,915 --> 01:07:26,626
I can imagine the scene.
Airs and graces, music.

932
01:07:26,709 --> 01:07:28,544
Some pastries perhaps?

933
01:07:28,628 --> 01:07:31,464
I have to bear the brunt
of your idiocies.

934
01:07:32,506 --> 01:07:36,343
Headmaster, you have to admit music
doesn't interfere with discipline.

935
01:07:36,427 --> 01:07:38,971
- We've had fewer problems lately.
- Chance.

936
01:07:39,012 --> 01:07:42,098
- I don't believe in chance, Headmaster.
- I realize that.

937
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:44,893
Who else could have told
the Foundation?

938
01:07:44,934 --> 01:07:46,227
I did.

939
01:07:48,688 --> 01:07:50,273
You can write?

940
01:07:50,356 --> 01:07:53,526
- Mr. Maxence acted for the best...
- Spare me your comments.

941
01:07:53,567 --> 01:07:55,486
I don't like your manners, Mathieu.

942
01:07:55,569 --> 01:07:57,488
You don't like anything, Headmaster.

943
01:07:57,571 --> 01:08:00,407
Mr. Rachin. You're wanted
in the visiting room.

944
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:03,827
Later.

945
01:08:07,205 --> 01:08:09,248
This is for you.

946
01:08:09,332 --> 01:08:12,293
Sometimes I think we should have
let Mondain strangle him.

947
01:08:16,630 --> 01:08:19,424
Violette was thanking me
for helping her son.

948
01:08:19,466 --> 01:08:23,970
She wanted to speak to me privately
to share some important news

949
01:08:24,054 --> 01:08:27,515
at the Caf de la Place,
on the 20th, at 4:00.

950
01:08:28,224 --> 01:08:32,186
I wrote to the Conservatory in Lyon.
I'm acquainted with the director.

951
01:08:32,228 --> 01:08:35,689
He was very nice about it.
He'll be happy to give him an audition

952
01:08:35,773 --> 01:08:39,568
and if he's admitted, he'll try
very hard to get him a scholarship.

953
01:08:41,027 --> 01:08:44,322
I believe things are about to change
for the better.

954
01:08:44,406 --> 01:08:45,824
Really?

955
01:08:46,157 --> 01:08:48,951
Since I met you,

956
01:08:48,993 --> 01:08:52,288
I... well...

957
01:08:52,330 --> 01:08:54,832
...my life has... How can I say it?

958
01:08:55,833 --> 01:08:57,126
Changed dramatically?

959
01:08:57,209 --> 01:08:58,710
Yes.

960
01:08:59,711 --> 01:09:02,047
Thanks to you.

961
01:09:02,130 --> 01:09:05,383
- It's such a surprise.
- I'd lost faith too.

962
01:09:06,968 --> 01:09:10,346
Maybe I shouldn't get my hopes up yet.

963
01:09:10,429 --> 01:09:13,140
You can trust me.

964
01:09:13,974 --> 01:09:16,435
You did bring me luck.

965
01:09:16,477 --> 01:09:17,644
Luck?

966
01:09:22,190 --> 01:09:23,733
I met someone.

967
01:09:25,610 --> 01:09:28,404
He's an engineer.
From Lyon, of all things.

968
01:09:28,488 --> 01:09:33,284
I met him at the caf.
He's building a bridge in the area.

969
01:09:39,414 --> 01:09:41,833
Are you all right?

970
01:09:41,917 --> 01:09:45,712
I'm fine. It's a great opportunity
for you and for Pierre.

971
01:09:48,673 --> 01:09:51,300
Don't be upset, but I have to go.

972
01:09:51,384 --> 01:09:53,969
I'd like the three of us
to have lunch someday.

973
01:09:55,471 --> 01:09:58,599
You can tell him all about Pierre.
Will you do it?

974
01:09:58,682 --> 01:10:00,434
Why not?

975
01:10:02,352 --> 01:10:03,645
Goodbye.

976
01:10:05,105 --> 01:10:06,523
Goodbye.

977
01:10:09,859 --> 01:10:11,819
Thank you for everything.

978
01:10:14,822 --> 01:10:16,490
I almost forgot.

979
01:10:16,532 --> 01:10:18,534
Don't tell Pierre right away.

980
01:10:32,254 --> 01:10:34,340
Excuse me. May I take the chair?

981
01:10:34,381 --> 01:10:36,175
- Yes, of course.
- Thank you.

982
01:11:59,126 --> 01:12:01,920
Countess, a few flowers.

983
01:12:01,962 --> 01:12:05,048
I didn't understand everything,
but I got the feelings.

984
01:12:05,131 --> 01:12:06,716
Thank you, child.

985
01:12:07,175 --> 01:12:08,676
Take these.

986
01:12:08,760 --> 01:12:12,680
Countess, let me introduce
Mr. Mathieu, our prefect,

987
01:12:12,763 --> 01:12:14,932
who's in charge of the chorus.

988
01:12:15,015 --> 01:12:17,226
- Countess.
- Well done, sir.

989
01:12:17,309 --> 01:12:22,022
Mr. Rachin's humane teaching style
is of great interest to us,

990
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:24,733
and we thank you for your support.

991
01:12:24,774 --> 01:12:27,652
By the way, who decided
to form a chorus?

992
01:12:27,694 --> 01:12:30,154
- Well...
- I did, Countess.

993
01:12:30,238 --> 01:12:31,656
I did.

994
01:12:31,739 --> 01:12:34,074
Indeed, Countess,

995
01:12:34,116 --> 01:12:37,077
I'm very happy to help
such an understanding headmaster.

996
01:12:37,161 --> 01:12:39,413
Well, let them sing.

997
01:12:41,540 --> 01:12:44,167
He's too modest
to enjoy compliments.

998
01:12:44,250 --> 01:12:48,296
- Very true.
- What are they going to sing for us?

999
01:12:48,379 --> 01:12:51,173
Rameau's Hymn to Night,
Countess.

1000
01:12:51,257 --> 01:12:53,050
It must be marvelous.

1001
01:12:56,053 --> 01:12:57,721
Excuse me?

1002
01:12:57,763 --> 01:13:01,141
Who's the little boy standing aside?
Has he been punished?

1003
01:13:01,224 --> 01:13:03,393
- That one?
- Yes.

1004
01:13:03,435 --> 01:13:05,520
He's a special case.

1005
01:13:05,603 --> 01:13:07,313
May I?

1006
01:13:19,074 --> 01:13:22,619
O Night

1007
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:26,706
Bring to

1008
01:13:26,789 --> 01:13:30,168
The Earth

1009
01:13:30,209 --> 01:13:34,380
The enchanting calm

1010
01:13:34,463 --> 01:13:40,218
Of your mystery

1011
01:13:40,302 --> 01:13:43,930
The shadow which follows you

1012
01:13:43,972 --> 01:13:46,849
Is so sweet

1013
01:13:46,891 --> 01:13:51,771
It is such a sweet concert

1014
01:13:51,812 --> 01:13:57,568
Your voices chanting hope

1015
01:13:58,110 --> 01:14:02,155
Your power is so great

1016
01:14:02,239 --> 01:14:06,159
Transforming all into a dream

1017
01:14:28,471 --> 01:14:31,891
O Night

1018
01:14:33,017 --> 01:14:37,020
O leave still

1019
01:14:37,104 --> 01:14:40,691
To the Earth

1020
01:14:40,732 --> 01:14:44,861
The enchanting calm

1021
01:14:44,944 --> 01:14:50,700
Of your mystery

1022
01:14:51,284 --> 01:14:55,871
The shadow which follows you

1023
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:58,165
Is so sweet

1024
01:14:58,207 --> 01:15:02,669
Is there anything more beautiful

1025
01:15:02,752 --> 01:15:08,174
Than a dream?

1026
01:15:08,257 --> 01:15:12,803
Is there any truth

1027
01:15:12,887 --> 01:15:15,681
Sweeter

1028
01:15:15,764 --> 01:15:21,520
Than hope?

1029
01:15:36,367 --> 01:15:39,536
Morhange's eyes followed my tempo,

1030
01:15:39,578 --> 01:15:42,122
and in them,
I suddenly read many things:

1031
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,958
pride and
the joy of my forgiveness,

1032
01:15:45,041 --> 01:15:47,835
but also something quite new to him.

1033
01:15:47,919 --> 01:15:49,712
A feeling of gratitude.

1034
01:15:51,797 --> 01:15:54,049
First day of summer.

1035
01:15:54,133 --> 01:15:56,802
Our chorus has a new member.

1036
01:16:01,139 --> 01:16:04,476
I'm sorry, I missed the reprise.
My fault. Go on.

1037
01:16:04,559 --> 01:16:06,227
All right. Again.

1038
01:16:30,416 --> 01:16:33,919
In their eyes,
I can see the desire to flee,

1039
01:16:34,003 --> 01:16:36,422
to build a hut way up in the sky.

1040
01:16:36,505 --> 01:16:38,882
This fine weather makes them sad.

1041
01:16:57,900 --> 01:17:00,569
You have to see this. It's important.

1042
01:17:03,655 --> 01:17:06,157
While I was cleaning graffiti
off the toilet walls,

1043
01:17:06,241 --> 01:17:08,618
I lifted a stone and found this.

1044
01:17:09,285 --> 01:17:11,495
- That's Corbin's harmonica.
- And that.

1045
01:17:11,579 --> 01:17:13,581
It's 200,000 or more.

1046
01:17:22,881 --> 01:17:25,050
No one knew about your hideaway.

1047
01:17:26,509 --> 01:17:29,470
So don't tell me
it was there by chance.

1048
01:17:29,512 --> 01:17:32,431
You know they expelled Mondain
because of the theft.

1049
01:17:32,515 --> 01:17:34,391
I didn't know.

1050
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:37,436
That's true. You didn't know.

1051
01:17:37,478 --> 01:17:39,396
Now you know.

1052
01:17:39,438 --> 01:17:41,857
Why? What did you want to do with it?

1053
01:17:43,233 --> 01:17:45,735
If I tell you,
will you tell anyone else?

1054
01:17:45,819 --> 01:17:47,362
No one.

1055
01:17:47,403 --> 01:17:49,322
I swear.

1056
01:17:51,240 --> 01:17:53,242
I wanted to buy...

1057
01:17:53,325 --> 01:17:55,160
To buy what?

1058
01:17:55,953 --> 01:17:57,996
A hot air balloon.

1059
01:17:59,373 --> 01:18:02,292
I don't know who took it,
but it proves Mondain's innocence.

1060
01:18:02,375 --> 01:18:04,711
He'd never have left without the money.

1061
01:18:04,753 --> 01:18:07,130
I'll investigate when I come back.

1062
01:18:07,213 --> 01:18:09,173
But don't worry about it, Mathieu.

1063
01:18:09,257 --> 01:18:13,094
Even if Mondain was innocent,
it won't last. We can't help his type.

1064
01:18:13,177 --> 01:18:16,347
- What about justice?
- Let her take care of him.

1065
01:18:16,388 --> 01:18:18,557
Headmaster, wait for me.
Wait for me.

1066
01:18:18,599 --> 01:18:20,475
Are you leaving too?

1067
01:18:20,517 --> 01:18:23,520
I'm getting a lift. I'm spending
the holidays with relatives.

1068
01:18:23,561 --> 01:18:25,271
At my sister's house.

1069
01:18:26,397 --> 01:18:28,149
They have a piano.

1070
01:18:37,407 --> 01:18:39,243
Do you know why Rachin
went to Lyon?

1071
01:18:39,326 --> 01:18:43,038
I think he's supposed to discuss
the balance sheet with the committee.

1072
01:18:44,164 --> 01:18:45,707
- No?
- Yes.

1073
01:18:45,790 --> 01:18:49,419
But he's mostly going to run
after a promotion and a medal.

1074
01:18:50,545 --> 01:18:52,922
Do you think he'll get them?

1075
01:18:52,963 --> 01:18:56,633
He's really smart. He's going
to present an impeccable report

1076
01:18:56,675 --> 01:18:59,886
without saying a word
about all the horrible things.

1077
01:18:59,970 --> 01:19:02,764
He'll even claim the success
of the chorus for himself.

1078
01:19:02,847 --> 01:19:03,807
Success?

1079
01:19:03,890 --> 01:19:06,351
Certainly. I heard them.
They're good.

1080
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,146
Sir, is it true that
Langlois left with the head?

1081
01:19:10,188 --> 01:19:13,399
Yes. Chabert and Carpentier
have taken two weeks' holidays.

1082
01:19:13,441 --> 01:19:15,901
- We're in charge.
- There's no class today?

1083
01:19:17,986 --> 01:19:19,321
No.

1084
01:19:19,363 --> 01:19:21,782
- What are we going to do?
- Take a nap.

1085
01:19:21,865 --> 01:19:24,242
I have a better idea.

1086
01:19:28,496 --> 01:19:30,039
Thank you.

1087
01:19:30,122 --> 01:19:33,084
I don't want to...

1088
01:19:33,167 --> 01:19:35,461
- Your rosette?
- Yes.

1089
01:19:37,171 --> 01:19:39,548
The bird is in the nest, Mr. Rachin.

1090
01:19:41,049 --> 01:19:43,260
I can't thank you enough.

1091
01:19:45,470 --> 01:19:48,264
I'm sorry, Headmaster.
You're wanted on the telephone.

1092
01:19:53,936 --> 01:19:55,437
I'm sorry.

1093
01:20:12,703 --> 01:20:14,038
Headmaster!

1094
01:20:14,997 --> 01:20:17,666
- Do something. My son is up there.
- Let me through.

1095
01:20:18,000 --> 01:20:20,127
The fire had caught under the eaves.

1096
01:20:20,210 --> 01:20:23,922
The dormitories, where the children
had last been seen, were in flames.

1097
01:20:24,005 --> 01:20:26,007
Sixty unfortunate children,

1098
01:20:26,090 --> 01:20:28,176
caught in a snare.

1099
01:20:28,259 --> 01:20:30,803
Rachin saw his promotion
and his rosette

1100
01:20:30,845 --> 01:20:32,930
destroyed before his very eyes.

1101
01:20:33,013 --> 01:20:34,723
But, suddenly...

1102
01:21:22,058 --> 01:21:26,187
After breakfast, we used the door
leading out of the vegetable patch

1103
01:21:26,229 --> 01:21:29,232
to avoid old Marie and the villagers.

1104
01:21:29,315 --> 01:21:31,150
We went to the forest of Lignan.

1105
01:21:31,192 --> 01:21:33,402
For what purpose?

1106
01:21:33,486 --> 01:21:36,822
A treasure hunt.
They were so happy.

1107
01:21:39,950 --> 01:21:43,953
I don't need to tell you
how disappointed I am, Mr. Maxence.

1108
01:21:44,037 --> 01:21:46,831
This was entirely my idea, Headmaster.

1109
01:21:46,915 --> 01:21:50,501
Mr. Maxence never stopped
trying to dissuade me.

1110
01:21:50,585 --> 01:21:52,128
Not very convincing.

1111
01:21:52,169 --> 01:21:55,965
We could also consider the fact
that we saved the children's lives.

1112
01:21:56,048 --> 01:21:59,509
If you hadn't left the school,
it wouldn't have caught fire.

1113
01:21:59,593 --> 01:22:02,012
I don't even know
why I'm listening to you.

1114
01:22:02,095 --> 01:22:06,933
Mr. Maxence, owing to your long years
of service, I'll just suspend you.

1115
01:22:07,976 --> 01:22:10,478
As for you, Mr. Mathieu, you're fired.

1116
01:22:10,561 --> 01:22:12,646
For breaking the rules.

1117
01:22:12,688 --> 01:22:14,607
Then you should fire me too.

1118
01:22:14,648 --> 01:22:16,525
You don't get to decide.

1119
01:22:16,608 --> 01:22:20,529
It's nice of you, Mr. Maxence,
but you're needed here.

1120
01:22:20,612 --> 01:22:23,907
Think about the children,
since this gentleman never does.

1121
01:22:27,035 --> 01:22:29,287
I've settled up with you. Here.

1122
01:22:29,328 --> 01:22:32,456
You're leaving right now,
on the 6:00 bus.

1123
01:22:32,498 --> 01:22:35,542
You're allowed no contact
with your former students. None.

1124
01:22:35,626 --> 01:22:38,003
- What?
- Mr. Maxence, see to it.

1125
01:22:38,086 --> 01:22:39,796
Get out.

1126
01:22:43,800 --> 01:22:49,013
Headmaster, before I go,
I'll tell you what I think of you.

1127
01:22:49,097 --> 01:22:52,058
- I already know, Mathieu.
- You're an incompetent,

1128
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:54,143
- truly evil man.
- What about them?

1129
01:22:54,226 --> 01:22:56,103
They're not here by choice.

1130
01:22:56,186 --> 01:22:58,438
Neither am I.
I never wanted to be a teacher.

1131
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,358
Don't tell me you wanted to come
to that miserable place.

1132
01:23:01,441 --> 01:23:04,444
- You had other ambitions? So did I.
- Don't take it out on them.

1133
01:23:04,486 --> 01:23:06,905
Do you think I like being a warden?

1134
01:23:06,946 --> 01:23:08,823
Someone has to do it.

1135
01:23:08,906 --> 01:23:12,034
Pack up your bags and go to Paris.
Make the Ministry rounds.

1136
01:23:12,118 --> 01:23:14,078
Knock-knock.
"Hello. My name is Mathieu.

1137
01:23:14,161 --> 01:23:16,288
We need real teachers
instead of washouts."

1138
01:23:16,372 --> 01:23:18,749
Fight for the cause
if you believe in it, Mathieu.

1139
01:23:18,832 --> 01:23:21,042
Saint Mathieu.

1140
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:23,295
You're nothing but a failed musician.

1141
01:23:23,378 --> 01:23:26,339
A prefect. A small prefect.
Small, small, small.

1142
01:23:26,965 --> 01:23:29,634
"What do you do, Mr. Mathieu?"
"I'm a prefect."

1143
01:23:29,675 --> 01:23:32,053
Small. Small. Small.

1144
01:23:33,137 --> 01:23:34,555
You're crazy.

1145
01:23:34,638 --> 01:23:36,140
I'm tired.

1146
01:23:36,223 --> 01:23:37,808
Go to the devil.

1147
01:23:37,891 --> 01:23:40,268
No, I'm leaving him behind.

1148
01:23:52,780 --> 01:23:57,076
I had hoped a few students
would break the rules to say goodbye.

1149
01:23:57,117 --> 01:23:59,036
I saw no one.

1150
01:23:59,119 --> 01:24:02,289
The wisdom of these children
came across as indifference.

1151
01:24:02,914 --> 01:24:05,250
And Morhange...

1152
01:24:05,291 --> 01:24:07,043
Enough.

1153
01:24:25,101 --> 01:24:26,895
"See you soon, Mr. Mathieu."

1154
01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:28,396
"Goodbye, Chrome Dome."

1155
01:24:37,196 --> 01:24:40,365
On the first note, I recognized
Boniface's careful script.

1156
01:24:40,449 --> 01:24:44,452
The spelling mistakes
were Ppinot's, of course.

1157
01:24:44,536 --> 01:24:47,955
This one, filled with music notes,
came from Morhange.

1158
01:24:48,998 --> 01:24:51,083
And this one...

1159
01:24:51,167 --> 01:24:52,585
And that one...

1160
01:25:16,315 --> 01:25:18,192
Be silent! Make them stop!

1161
01:25:18,233 --> 01:25:20,360
The door's locked.

1162
01:25:20,444 --> 01:25:22,028
Open up!

1163
01:25:22,779 --> 01:25:26,074
Right then I felt a sudden burst
ofjoy and optimism.

1164
01:25:26,157 --> 01:25:28,534
I wanted to share it
with the entire world.

1165
01:25:28,618 --> 01:25:30,536
But who would have listened?

1166
01:25:30,620 --> 01:25:33,289
No one even knew I was alive.

1167
01:25:34,165 --> 01:25:37,084
The great artist would soon
give way to the ordinary man.

1168
01:25:38,043 --> 01:25:40,087
I'm Clment Mathieu,

1169
01:25:40,170 --> 01:25:42,964
a failed musician,
an unemployed prefect.

1170
01:25:43,048 --> 01:25:45,049
"I'm Clment Mathieu,

1171
01:25:45,133 --> 01:25:48,803
a failed musician,
an unemployed prefect."

1172
01:26:02,232 --> 01:26:04,401
What happened next?

1173
01:26:04,442 --> 01:26:07,320
He never finished his journal.

1174
01:26:09,780 --> 01:26:12,408
But I can tell you the story.

1175
01:26:14,451 --> 01:26:17,204
Ppinot answered my questions.

1176
01:26:17,246 --> 01:26:22,083
The following day, on the way back,
my childhood caught me by the throat.

1177
01:26:23,251 --> 01:26:26,880
When Mathieu was fired,
my mother took me back home.

1178
01:26:26,963 --> 01:26:29,966
We left for Lyon, where
I was admitted to the Conservatory.

1179
01:26:31,467 --> 01:26:33,844
The engineer tried
to send me to boarding school.

1180
01:26:33,928 --> 01:26:36,680
She refused. He left us.

1181
01:26:37,389 --> 01:26:43,144
Chabert, Langlois and old Maxence
joined forces to expose Rachin's abuse.

1182
01:26:43,186 --> 01:26:47,106
The children were questioned
and Rachin was fired.

1183
01:26:51,944 --> 01:26:55,614
Clment Mathieu gave music lessons
for the rest of his life,

1184
01:26:55,698 --> 01:26:58,075
without courting notoriety.

1185
01:26:58,158 --> 01:27:00,744
Everything he did, he kept for himself.

1186
01:27:01,995 --> 01:27:04,873
For himself? No, not quite.

1187
01:27:04,914 --> 01:27:06,666
Mr. Mathieu.

1188
01:27:09,001 --> 01:27:10,711
Mr. Mathieu.

1189
01:27:13,005 --> 01:27:14,673
Wait a bit.

1190
01:27:17,509 --> 01:27:19,428
Mr. Mathieu.

1191
01:27:24,974 --> 01:27:26,142
What are you doing?

1192
01:27:26,226 --> 01:27:28,728
Can you take me with you?

1193
01:27:28,811 --> 01:27:30,188
Sir.

1194
01:27:30,229 --> 01:27:34,024
I can't do that. You have to go back
to school. They'll punish you.

1195
01:27:34,108 --> 01:27:35,067
Please?

1196
01:27:35,150 --> 01:27:37,277
- Can we go now?
- Coming.

1197
01:27:37,361 --> 01:27:40,405
It's forbidden.
I can't take you with me.

1198
01:27:40,489 --> 01:27:42,073
Go back.

1199
01:27:42,157 --> 01:27:43,742
Go on.

1200
01:27:44,075 --> 01:27:45,660
Go on.

1201
01:28:10,183 --> 01:28:12,685
Ppinot had been right all along.

1202
01:28:12,768 --> 01:28:15,437
Mathieu was fired on a Saturday.
