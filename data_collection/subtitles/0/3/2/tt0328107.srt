1
00:02:27,482 --> 00:02:30,280
<i>- S. Bueno.
- Family is everything.</i>

2
00:02:30,385 --> 00:02:32,182
<i>No?</i>

3
00:02:32,287 --> 00:02:35,688
<i>Now, do you love your son?</i>

4
00:02:36,658 --> 00:02:40,424
S.

5
00:02:47,302 --> 00:02:51,898
<i>Now... do you understand?</i>

6
00:02:52,006 --> 00:02:56,375
<i>You have a $10 million insurance policy.
I know that.</i>

7
00:05:05,874 --> 00:05:08,001
Georgina!

8
00:05:08,109 --> 00:05:11,374
Obey me, I will love you.
Come on.

9
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:13,242
That's how it works, huh?

10
00:05:13,348 --> 00:05:16,511
<i>- Simple.
- That's right.</i>

11
00:05:16,618 --> 00:05:18,518
Mwah.

12
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:25,956
She got a sister?

13
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:29,257
How's business?

14
00:05:29,364 --> 00:05:32,265
The Japanese are here in a big way.

15
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:36,192
Cheap labor, factory space.

16
00:05:36,304 --> 00:05:40,263
But they feel a lot safer living
over the border in El Paso.

17
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,435
I ferry them back and forth.
They think I'm John Wayne.

18
00:05:43,545 --> 00:05:45,445
- Ah.
- Come on.

19
00:05:49,918 --> 00:05:53,149
- I live like a king down here.
- Yes, you do.

20
00:05:56,891 --> 00:06:00,054
- You been workin'?
- Yeah. No.

21
00:06:00,161 --> 00:06:02,220
Nah. Been movin' around,
you know.

22
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:06,391
Colombia, couple of places I can't name.
Nothing catches my fancy.

23
00:06:08,269 --> 00:06:11,238
Oh.

24
00:06:11,339 --> 00:06:13,899
You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?

25
00:06:14,008 --> 00:06:16,568
- No.
- You don't?

26
00:06:16,678 --> 00:06:20,842
Me either.

27
00:06:20,949 --> 00:06:25,750
- How long you staying?
- I don't know. I just... you know.

28
00:06:25,853 --> 00:06:29,812
I wanted to see you, Ray,
see how you're doin'.

29
00:06:29,924 --> 00:06:32,449
You know, I came by on impulse.

30
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,121
Well, I could do with some impulse.

31
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:49,266
What happened?

32
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:51,572
Family paid the ransom...

33
00:06:51,679 --> 00:06:55,672
then they sent the kid home
after a couple of days...

34
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,944
minus an ear, of course.

35
00:06:58,052 --> 00:07:01,681
Now every mother in Mexico City with a little
bit of money wants bigger and better bodyguards...

36
00:07:01,789 --> 00:07:03,757
my own wife included.

37
00:07:03,858 --> 00:07:07,157
I hate to break it to you,
but she's right. She's right.

38
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:13,129
Look, Sammy, all my clients have, uh,
kidnap and ransom insurance.

39
00:07:13,234 --> 00:07:16,465
I have a policy. A.I.G.
My dad gave it to me.

40
00:07:16,571 --> 00:07:19,836
Yeah, I know.
I got it for your dad.

41
00:07:19,941 --> 00:07:22,876
<i>But what are you gonna do in 60 days
when you can't renew it?</i>

42
00:07:22,977 --> 00:07:27,243
- You can't because you don't have a bodyguard.
- I had to let Emilio go.

43
00:07:27,348 --> 00:07:30,977
You gotta please Lisa.
I mean, hey, ass like that's hard to find.

44
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:37,687
Look, a bodyguard's
like anything else.

45
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:41,057
You get what you pay for, okay?

46
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:44,154
You could do this.
You get one that's got a decent rsum.

47
00:07:44,265 --> 00:07:46,597
We're not looking for
goddamn Superman here, right?

48
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:49,431
Get someone cheap
till you renew the policy...

49
00:07:49,537 --> 00:07:52,904
and then, uh...
then fire the prick for whatever.

50
00:07:53,007 --> 00:07:55,066
Incompetence.

51
00:07:55,176 --> 00:07:59,579
All kidding aside, the most important thing
is that your daughter goes back to school...

52
00:07:59,681 --> 00:08:02,650
and that your wife gets to save face.

53
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:07,551
This way, you won't be the only
unprotected family in the neighborhood.

54
00:08:20,168 --> 00:08:23,365
<i>That's right. A bodyguard.
Your Spanish is good enough.</i>

55
00:08:23,471 --> 00:08:26,872
- You're crazy.
- You even look the part.

56
00:08:26,974 --> 00:08:29,442
In my state,
I couldn't guard a corpse.

57
00:08:29,544 --> 00:08:32,342
<i>It's rich guys flashing their cash.
It's all for show.</i>

58
00:08:32,447 --> 00:08:37,578
<i>- Nothing's gonna happen. - Yeah? You
think they'd hire a drunk, a has-been?</i>

59
00:08:39,253 --> 00:08:42,552
You have to keep it under control.

60
00:08:42,657 --> 00:08:47,424
What if there was, you know, say,
a kidnapping attempt? What do I do then?

61
00:08:47,528 --> 00:08:51,555
<i>You do your best. They're not gonna be
paying you enough to perform miracles.</i>

62
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:54,260
<i>- I don't know.
- It's not exactly a scam, Crease.</i>

63
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:58,600
- Even at half speed, you're pretty damn good.
- Yeah.

64
00:08:58,706 --> 00:09:00,901
Bodyguard's gotta be close
to people though.

65
00:09:01,008 --> 00:09:03,841
He gotta talk all the time,
and I'm no good at that.

66
00:09:03,945 --> 00:09:07,472
You'll be the silent type.
People are gonna appreciate that.

67
00:09:14,422 --> 00:09:17,289
Bodyguard. So who's the guy?

68
00:09:17,391 --> 00:09:20,292
Samuel Ramos. He's a young guy.

69
00:09:20,394 --> 00:09:23,192
<i>He owns one of the plants in Jurez.</i>

70
00:09:23,297 --> 00:09:25,231
<i>Yeah?</i>

71
00:09:25,333 --> 00:09:28,131
The Jap car industry is in the toilet.

72
00:09:28,236 --> 00:09:31,171
He's trying to persuade Ford
to partner with him.

73
00:09:31,272 --> 00:09:35,140
I think he's in trouble.
His family lives in Mexico City.

74
00:09:35,243 --> 00:09:37,768
He asked me if I knew
anybody he could trust.

75
00:09:39,347 --> 00:09:42,339
- And you thought of me.
- Yeah.

76
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:45,851
Take a job, Crease.
Breathe some air.

77
00:09:45,953 --> 00:09:48,319
<i>Then decide if you want
to stick around or not.</i>

78
00:09:48,422 --> 00:09:52,518
<i>Besides, I'm glad to see you.
I got nobody to talk to down here.</i>

79
00:10:00,001 --> 00:10:02,902
Listen, my wife wants someone
presentable and polite.

80
00:10:05,273 --> 00:10:08,800
You'll be the fifth candidate
she sees this week.

81
00:10:08,910 --> 00:10:10,639
Your rsum's quite impressive.

82
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:15,205
<i>Sixteen years of military experience,
extensive counterterrorism work.</i>

83
00:10:15,316 --> 00:10:18,877
I'm surprised anybody could afford you.
What's the catch?

84
00:10:18,986 --> 00:10:21,250
I drink.

85
00:10:21,355 --> 00:10:23,346
How does that affect you?

86
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,925
Well...

87
00:10:26,027 --> 00:10:28,154
coordination, reaction time.

88
00:10:28,262 --> 00:10:32,028
If top professionals try to kidnap
your daughter, I'll do the best I can...

89
00:10:32,133 --> 00:10:35,159
but the service will be
on par with the pay.

90
00:10:36,304 --> 00:10:38,329
What if amateurs tried?

91
00:10:38,439 --> 00:10:41,567
I'd probably kill 'em.
Is that likely?

92
00:10:41,676 --> 00:10:43,644
No.

93
00:10:43,744 --> 00:10:46,508
No one is to know about your drinking.
That includes my wife.

94
00:11:13,407 --> 00:11:16,171
<i>Lisa!</i>

95
00:11:18,379 --> 00:11:20,279
Lisa!

96
00:11:31,492 --> 00:11:34,393
My wife, Lisa.
And this is John Creasy.

97
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,665
- You're an American.
- So are you.

98
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:47,503
It's all in there.

99
00:11:50,544 --> 00:11:52,478
Would you like a drink?

100
00:11:52,580 --> 00:11:55,310
Yes, uh, Jack and water'd be good.

101
00:11:56,884 --> 00:12:00,411
<i>- Have you done much of this kind of work before?
- No, ma'am.</i>

102
00:12:00,521 --> 00:12:04,287
But he has a lot of experience
in related fields.

103
00:12:06,794 --> 00:12:09,490
- You have a family, Mr. Creasy?
- No.

104
00:12:09,597 --> 00:12:11,792
Pita.

105
00:12:11,899 --> 00:12:13,867
<i>Pita.</i>

106
00:12:15,202 --> 00:12:17,295
<i>- Thank you.
- Yes, Mom?</i>

107
00:12:17,405 --> 00:12:19,305
Honey, this is, uh, Mr. Creasy.

108
00:12:24,478 --> 00:12:26,946
In English, honey.

109
00:12:27,048 --> 00:12:29,676
Um, do you wanna show
Mr. Creasy to his room?

110
00:12:29,784 --> 00:12:33,481
- This way, Mr. Creasy.
- Okay.

111
00:12:41,495 --> 00:12:43,895
Thank you.

112
00:12:50,838 --> 00:12:53,636
Just like that?

113
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:56,141
I think it's nice...

114
00:12:56,243 --> 00:12:58,711
that he's an American.

115
00:12:58,813 --> 00:13:03,011
I think it's terrific. You sure?

116
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:07,984
Thank you.

117
00:13:08,089 --> 00:13:10,717
Thank you.

118
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:13,293
I feel better now.

119
00:13:15,196 --> 00:13:18,097
<i>- Hola, Bruno!
- Buenas tardes!</i>

120
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:20,497
That's Bruno, the gardener.

121
00:13:20,601 --> 00:13:22,660
And, um, that's Maria, the cook.

122
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,568
<i>- Hola, Maria!
- Hola, Pita.</i>

123
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:31,869
We fixed the room up two weeks ago.
It's nicer than before.

124
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:38,883
<i>You've got a TV and C.D. Player.
What kind of music do you like, Mr. Creasy?</i>

125
00:13:38,986 --> 00:13:41,352
I don't know.

126
00:13:41,455 --> 00:13:43,946
- You don't know?
- I don't know.

127
00:13:44,058 --> 00:13:47,221
That's Bird.

128
00:13:47,328 --> 00:13:50,195
Emilio forgot to take him
when he left.

129
00:13:51,365 --> 00:13:53,697
Emilio was my last bodyguard.

130
00:13:55,703 --> 00:13:59,935
Have you protected a lot of children
before, Mr. Creasy?

131
00:14:00,041 --> 00:14:02,805
Creasy. You can call me Creasy.
And no, you're the first.

132
00:14:02,910 --> 00:14:04,810
Creasy.

133
00:14:04,912 --> 00:14:06,846
Bye, Creasy.

134
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:09,609
So long.

135
00:14:10,718 --> 00:14:12,447
Bye, Bird.

136
00:14:17,124 --> 00:14:19,456
Ow.

137
00:14:22,430 --> 00:14:25,922
- School tomorrow, peeps.
- Does that mean we can get a dog?

138
00:14:27,334 --> 00:14:29,802
<i>Dad promised me one
when I went back to school.</i>

139
00:14:29,904 --> 00:14:31,599
Yeah, we'll see.

140
00:14:31,705 --> 00:14:35,505
If you get a dog,
will you give up your bear?

141
00:14:35,609 --> 00:14:38,942
You're getting too old for him.

142
00:14:39,046 --> 00:14:42,447
<i>- How'd you like Mr. Creasy?
- Creasy.</i>

143
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:44,916
He said to call him just Creasy.

144
00:14:45,019 --> 00:14:47,487
- Uh-huh.
- That isn't disrespectful, is it?

145
00:14:47,588 --> 00:14:49,886
No, not if he asked you.

146
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,823
Here. There you go.

147
00:15:00,668 --> 00:15:04,468
- He's like a bear too.
- Yeah?

148
00:15:04,572 --> 00:15:06,870
A big, sad bear.

149
00:15:08,509 --> 00:15:12,138
- Is he sad?
- I think. Or something.

150
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,850
- Good night, honey.
- Night.

151
00:15:21,288 --> 00:15:24,553
- Oh, can you get me some floss in the morning?
- Floss?

152
00:15:24,658 --> 00:15:28,185
- Yeah, the strawberry kind.
- Oh, sure.

153
00:15:30,531 --> 00:15:32,556
Good night, Bear.

154
00:15:33,667 --> 00:15:35,635
Creasy Bear.

155
00:16:09,170 --> 00:16:11,502
What's that one for?

156
00:16:11,605 --> 00:16:13,505
<i>La Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

157
00:16:13,607 --> 00:16:18,010
Business. For Toyota, for Ford.

158
00:16:18,112 --> 00:16:20,740
If one dies, maybe she can
resurrect the other one.

159
00:16:20,848 --> 00:16:23,408
I don't know.

160
00:16:23,517 --> 00:16:26,452
She likes him.

161
00:16:28,155 --> 00:16:31,352
- What are you talking about?
- Creasy.

162
00:16:32,893 --> 00:16:35,555
Pita likes him.

163
00:16:35,663 --> 00:16:37,563
Pita loves school.

164
00:16:37,665 --> 00:16:42,864
<i>Pita would love Count Dracula
if he took her back there, honey.</i>

165
00:16:42,970 --> 00:16:44,938
Okay?

166
00:16:47,408 --> 00:16:50,275
<i>- Hey. Are you okay?
- I don't know.</i>

167
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:54,473
Okay?

168
00:16:54,582 --> 00:16:57,016
I don't know, Lisa.

169
00:16:57,117 --> 00:16:59,085
I'm trying.

170
00:17:54,275 --> 00:17:56,243
Come on, Bird.

171
00:17:56,343 --> 00:17:59,710
That's right.
That's right. Come on.

172
00:17:59,813 --> 00:18:02,976
All right. Home to Emilio.

173
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:05,950
You're home free, baby.

174
00:18:26,073 --> 00:18:28,837
- Where are you from, Creasy?
- The U.S.

175
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:31,877
<i>- I know, but which state?
- No state in particular.</i>

176
00:18:31,979 --> 00:18:33,970
You can drive and talk
at the same time.

177
00:18:34,081 --> 00:18:36,549
No, I can't, Pita, so, please,
let me just do my job.

178
00:18:39,853 --> 00:18:42,720
Are you going to stay?

179
00:18:42,823 --> 00:18:44,723
My last bodyguard left.

180
00:18:44,825 --> 00:18:47,692
Somebody gave him
more money than we could.

181
00:18:47,795 --> 00:18:51,754
I guess that makes me
a bargain then, huh?

182
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:56,268
Being black... is that a positive or negative
for a bodyguard in Mexico?

183
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:58,270
Time will tell.

184
00:19:01,809 --> 00:19:06,041
There were 24 kidnappings
in Mexico City in the last six days.

185
00:19:06,146 --> 00:19:08,046
- Four a day.
- Yeah?

186
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:10,616
- Twenty-four? - Twenty-four. What
do you think about that, Creasy?

187
00:19:10,718 --> 00:19:14,381
- I think that you know entirely more than you should.
- Well, thank you.

188
00:19:37,511 --> 00:19:40,139
<i>Hola, Miguel.</i>

189
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,548
- See you later.
- You have to sign.

190
00:19:44,651 --> 00:19:48,951
- What?
- You have to sign in, show them your I.D.

191
00:19:49,056 --> 00:19:52,492
<i>Buenos das. Come on.</i>

192
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:55,560
Right there.

193
00:19:55,662 --> 00:19:58,290
<i>- Hola, Manuel.
- Hola, Pita.</i>

194
00:20:09,076 --> 00:20:10,976
<i>- Hola, Pita!
- Hola!</i>

195
00:20:11,078 --> 00:20:15,276
Pita! It's so good to have you back.

196
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:18,283
Sister Anna, this is
my new bodyguard, Creasy.

197
00:20:18,385 --> 00:20:21,513
Sister Anna, the headmistress.

198
00:20:21,622 --> 00:20:23,647
<i>Seor Creasy.</i>

199
00:20:23,757 --> 00:20:25,657
Hurry. Class is about to begin.

200
00:20:25,759 --> 00:20:28,091
- Go, go.
- Bye, Creasy.

201
00:20:28,195 --> 00:20:30,686
<i>- Madre.
- You must look after our Pita.</i>

202
00:20:30,798 --> 00:20:32,993
It is not good that she's late today.

203
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:37,662
I'm very sorry. I, uh... I'll have to get
used to the rules. It won't happen again.

204
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:41,332
No offense, but I regret
that your profession needs to exist.

205
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:44,570
<i>So do I, Madre. So do I.</i>

206
00:20:44,678 --> 00:20:48,637
Do you ever see the hand of God
in what you do?

207
00:20:50,250 --> 00:20:52,377
No, not for a long time.

208
00:20:52,486 --> 00:20:55,853
The Bible says,
"Be not overcome of evil, but overcome... "

209
00:20:55,956 --> 00:20:59,392
"Overcome evil with good. "

210
00:21:05,532 --> 00:21:08,330
<i>I'm the sheep that got lost, Madre.</i>

211
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:14,792
When you were a kid, Creasy,
did you like school?

212
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,565
- I don't remember.
- You don't remember?

213
00:22:18,672 --> 00:22:22,574
No, I don't remember.
It, uh... Nah, I didn't like it.

214
00:22:22,676 --> 00:22:24,735
Why not?

215
00:22:24,845 --> 00:22:27,405
Because it wasn't a school like yours.

216
00:22:27,514 --> 00:22:29,482
There was no, uh... no Sister Anna.

217
00:22:32,386 --> 00:22:34,513
Were you unhappy?

218
00:22:36,723 --> 00:22:40,124
Being unhappy, Pita, that's a state of mind.
I really don't remember.

219
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,663
What happened to your hand?

220
00:22:53,206 --> 00:22:55,106
- It's a birth defect.
- No, it's not.

221
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:59,474
Look, no more questions, okay?

222
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:01,946
- It really wasn't a question.
- It sounded like a question.

223
00:23:02,049 --> 00:23:04,643
<i>Look, I got a job to do. Hey!</i>

224
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:06,981
<i>No. Gracias. Gracias. No. No.</i>

225
00:23:07,087 --> 00:23:10,022
Listen to me.
I'm being paid to protect you, okay?

226
00:23:10,123 --> 00:23:13,092
No, no, no. I'm being paid
to be your bodyguard.

227
00:23:13,193 --> 00:23:16,287
<i>Look at me.
I'm not being paid to be your friend.</i>

228
00:23:16,396 --> 00:23:19,957
<i>I'm being paid to protect you,
so no more questions. That's it. Period.</i>

229
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:26,466
<i>- You hear me?
- Yes.</i>

230
00:23:26,573 --> 00:23:30,009
- And no crying.
- I'm not crying.

231
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:33,170
Well, don't start.

232
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,714
You gotta understand, this is a job.

233
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:38,614
In order for me to do...

234
00:23:38,719 --> 00:23:40,653
In order for... Wait a minute.

235
00:24:30,303 --> 00:24:32,271
Yeah, come in.

236
00:24:37,878 --> 00:24:40,039
Mr. Creasy.

237
00:24:40,147 --> 00:24:42,945
I just wanted to make sure
you have everything you need.

238
00:24:43,050 --> 00:24:45,018
I'm fine, thanks.

239
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,453
Is the food all right?
'Cause, uh, Maria told me you didn't eat.

240
00:24:50,557 --> 00:24:54,015
Uh... yeah, the food is great.

241
00:24:54,127 --> 00:24:56,618
I just wasn't that hungry tonight.

242
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,594
So you, uh, read the Bible?

243
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:06,332
Yeah, sometimes.

244
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:10,206
- Does it help?
- Yeah, sometimes.

245
00:25:12,512 --> 00:25:15,811
- Can I talk to you for a minute?
- Sure.

246
00:25:17,651 --> 00:25:20,779
How are you doing with Pita?

247
00:25:20,887 --> 00:25:22,787
Fine. Fine.

248
00:25:22,889 --> 00:25:26,154
Soon as she figures out that I'm
not her new toy, we'll be fine.

249
00:25:26,259 --> 00:25:29,228
- Yeah, she told me about that.
- Okay.

250
00:25:29,329 --> 00:25:32,958
- You don't have children, do you?
- I told you I didn't.

251
00:25:33,066 --> 00:25:36,524
Well, they can be tenacious
when they want something.

252
00:25:36,636 --> 00:25:40,970
<i>- And Pita just wants to be friends.
- Okay.</i>

253
00:25:41,074 --> 00:25:44,703
But you're paying me to protect her,
right? Not to be her friend.

254
00:25:44,811 --> 00:25:46,779
Right?

255
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:51,480
So, uh...

256
00:25:51,585 --> 00:25:54,110
look, maybe this isn't
gonna work out.

257
00:25:54,221 --> 00:25:58,180
Maybe your husband should find
somebody who's a little more sociable.

258
00:26:01,061 --> 00:26:02,961
No, you're right.

259
00:26:05,499 --> 00:26:08,400
You're being paid to protect her...

260
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:11,869
and I'm confident that you'll do that.

261
00:26:16,409 --> 00:26:19,776
I'll be coming with you tomorrow.
I hope that's all right.

262
00:26:50,644 --> 00:26:53,670
<i>You think God
will forgive us for what we've done?</i>

263
00:27:19,739 --> 00:27:22,071
<i>I'm tired of killin', Ray.</i>

264
00:27:26,513 --> 00:27:30,745
<i>You think God will forgive us
for what we've done?</i>

265
00:27:30,851 --> 00:27:34,343
<i>In my state, I couldn't...
I couldn't guard a corpse.</i>

266
00:27:34,454 --> 00:27:36,945
<i>Talk all the time.</i>

267
00:27:37,057 --> 00:27:39,048
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

268
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:43,356
<i>You know, I'm no good at that.</i>

269
00:27:44,698 --> 00:27:46,791
<i>You know how they say...</i>

270
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:51,269
<i>a bullet always tells the truth?</i>

271
00:28:32,379 --> 00:28:34,347
Yeah.

272
00:28:34,447 --> 00:28:36,608
- Hey.
- Crease.

273
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,411
What's wrong?

274
00:28:38,518 --> 00:28:41,954
Hey, listen, you-you ever have a...

275
00:28:42,055 --> 00:28:44,523
a nine-millimeter round
that didn't go off?

276
00:28:44,624 --> 00:28:47,422
Well, yeah. Failure to fire.

277
00:28:47,527 --> 00:28:50,655
I know.
Failure to fire and-and-and, uh...

278
00:28:50,764 --> 00:28:53,631
You know, I pulled the trigger
and... and... and...

279
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:55,633
click, nothing.

280
00:28:55,735 --> 00:28:58,033
You're talking about a bad primer.

281
00:28:58,138 --> 00:29:00,197
Yeah, I... Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

282
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:02,798
But I... You know, right, dimple.
Dimple on the primer.

283
00:29:02,909 --> 00:29:05,002
That may be.

284
00:29:05,111 --> 00:29:08,706
Well, like we used to say...

285
00:29:08,815 --> 00:29:12,683
a bullet always tells the truth.

286
00:29:17,991 --> 00:29:20,619
Crease?

287
00:29:20,727 --> 00:29:23,389
- You all right?
- Yeah.

288
00:29:24,731 --> 00:29:27,063
What were you shooting at?

289
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:29,294
Yeah, I'm sorry, Ray.
I'm sorry I woke you.

290
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:33,862
No, i-it's okay. Nothin'.
I was watchin' TV.

291
00:29:33,974 --> 00:29:36,807
Okay.

292
00:29:37,978 --> 00:29:40,173
All right.

293
00:30:57,023 --> 00:30:59,583
Pita, you have a pencil?

294
00:31:04,097 --> 00:31:05,724
Thank you.

295
00:31:39,466 --> 00:31:42,128
It's hard to get used to
the traffic down here.

296
00:31:42,235 --> 00:31:44,328
Yeah. I'm very sorry.

297
00:32:04,824 --> 00:32:07,122
- See you, baby.
- All right. See you later.

298
00:32:07,227 --> 00:32:09,491
- Hey. Don't forget your towel.
- Oh, thank you.

299
00:32:17,103 --> 00:32:20,595
<i>Bye. Buenas das.</i>

300
00:33:24,637 --> 00:33:27,538
- You're a strong swimmer.
- I never win.

301
00:33:32,345 --> 00:33:34,813
Thanks.

302
00:33:38,718 --> 00:33:42,552
<i>- So what do I do?
- What do you think you should do?</i>

303
00:33:42,655 --> 00:33:44,714
You're the fastest one in the water,
the slowest one off the blocks.

304
00:33:44,824 --> 00:33:48,260
- What do you think that means? What do you gotta do?
- Get faster off the blocks.

305
00:33:48,361 --> 00:33:50,591
Get faster off the blocks.

306
00:33:50,697 --> 00:33:54,064
- Our big swim meet is in three weeks.
- Yeah?

307
00:33:54,167 --> 00:33:56,931
<i>- I was gonna enter the 150 freestyle.
- Yeah, you'll be fine.</i>

308
00:33:57,036 --> 00:33:59,004
You'll be okay.

309
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,976
- I'll still be slow.
- You're not slow.

310
00:34:04,077 --> 00:34:06,671
I never finish better than third.

311
00:34:06,779 --> 00:34:09,646
All right.
Maybe you are slow then.

312
00:34:25,965 --> 00:34:28,195
<i>Go! Vamos!</i>

313
00:34:28,301 --> 00:34:30,496
<i>Vamos, Bird!</i>

314
00:34:30,603 --> 00:34:32,571
Vamos!

315
00:34:38,444 --> 00:34:41,072
<i>How do you think he got out?</i>

316
00:34:42,849 --> 00:34:45,875
- I let him go.
- It's better to be free, right?

317
00:34:45,985 --> 00:34:47,850
It's better for him.

318
00:34:49,822 --> 00:34:52,518
<i>Actually, he was driving me crazy.</i>

319
00:34:56,062 --> 00:34:58,030
Good night.

320
00:35:02,302 --> 00:35:04,998
Good night.

321
00:35:20,520 --> 00:35:23,080
- See you in a couple of days. I love you.
- All right. Love you.

322
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:25,089
Be good. Come on, Lise.

323
00:35:25,191 --> 00:35:28,683
- All right, sweetheart. We'll call you from Detroit.
- Okay.

324
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,730
- I love you.
- Love you.

325
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:33,799
<i>- Okay. Bye, honey.
- Seora.</i>

326
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:35,993
<i>- Bye.
- Oh. Gracias.</i>

327
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:38,570
<i>- Okay. Bye, honey!
- Bye.</i>

328
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,969
- I love you.
- Love you.

329
00:35:44,644 --> 00:35:47,340
I hate leaving her.

330
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,287
Concentratin'?

331
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:05,626
Eyes are closed?

332
00:36:08,368 --> 00:36:10,336
What happened?

333
00:36:10,436 --> 00:36:12,961
- I flinched.
- You flinched? The gunshot holds no fear.

334
00:36:13,072 --> 00:36:14,869
- Say it.
- The gunshot holds no fear.

335
00:36:14,974 --> 00:36:17,408
The gunshot holds no fear! Say it.

336
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:19,478
- The gunshot holds no fear.
- Louder!

337
00:36:19,579 --> 00:36:21,547
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- Louder!

338
00:36:21,647 --> 00:36:23,871
- The gunshot holds no fear!
- That's good.

339
00:36:23,983 --> 00:36:25,974
You welcome the sound.

340
00:36:26,085 --> 00:36:28,383
In fact, it's the sound
that sets you free.

341
00:36:28,488 --> 00:36:31,423
You are a prisoner on this block
until that sound sets you free.

342
00:36:31,524 --> 00:36:33,890
- Are you ready? Are you ready?
- Yes. Yes.

343
00:36:33,993 --> 00:36:35,585
- Are you set?
- Uh-huh.

344
00:36:42,869 --> 00:36:44,837
- Creasy?
- Hmm?

345
00:36:44,937 --> 00:36:48,100
- What's a concubine?
- Why do you ask?

346
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,607
It's in my history book.

347
00:36:50,710 --> 00:36:53,440
- Oh.
- It's like a wife, right?

348
00:36:53,546 --> 00:36:56,845
Yeah. Yes, uh... Can I see that?

349
00:36:56,949 --> 00:36:59,474
- Kind of a wife.
- Right there.

350
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:02,713
But the emperor of China
had 1,000 of them.

351
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,756
Um...

352
00:37:04,857 --> 00:37:08,953
Okay, like nowadays in-in the West,
they have one husband for one wife.

353
00:37:09,061 --> 00:37:11,621
But in the olden time cultures,
they had, uh...

354
00:37:11,731 --> 00:37:15,326
you know, different...
uh, different rules.

355
00:37:17,203 --> 00:37:19,967
- Why, you feel sorry for the husband?
- Yeah.

356
00:37:20,072 --> 00:37:22,472
Can you imagine my mom
multiplied by a thousand?

357
00:37:24,977 --> 00:37:28,970
Creasy. You're smiling.

358
00:37:29,081 --> 00:37:31,675
- What?
- You were smiling.

359
00:37:31,784 --> 00:37:33,877
- No, I'm not. No, I was not.
- You were.

360
00:37:33,986 --> 00:37:36,386
- You're not now, but you were.
- You were smiling. I wasn't.

361
00:37:36,489 --> 00:37:38,286
- You were.
- When?

362
00:37:38,391 --> 00:37:40,882
- Like five seconds ago.
- I'm not smiling.

363
00:37:40,993 --> 00:37:44,520
- A second ago you were.
- You said five seconds ago. Now that's six.

364
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:46,825
- Six seconds ago I wasn't smiling.
- Ten seconds ago.

365
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:50,562
Ten seconds ago I was smiling. Okay, in
the next 10 seconds, let's see who smiles first.

366
00:37:55,641 --> 00:37:58,337
- You smiled already. See? You did.
- Mmm!

367
00:37:58,444 --> 00:38:00,912
- No, that wasn't a... That was a smirk.
- Yeah, you...

368
00:38:01,013 --> 00:38:03,243
That's not a smile.
A smirk is different.

369
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:07,217
They both start with "S," but they're
not the same... Do your homework.

370
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,288
You were.

371
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:15,393
Bang!

372
00:38:15,495 --> 00:38:17,929
Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
Come back, come back.

373
00:38:18,030 --> 00:38:20,863
Bang!

374
00:38:20,967 --> 00:38:24,835
<i>Stop, stop, stop, stop,
stop, stop, stop, stop. Come here.</i>

375
00:38:24,937 --> 00:38:27,269
<i>Hurry up, hurry up. Set.</i>

376
00:38:27,373 --> 00:38:29,102
Bang!

377
00:38:29,208 --> 00:38:32,336
Bang!

378
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:36,849
You don't flinch when you hear
the gunshot, understand?

379
00:38:38,351 --> 00:38:41,718
You listen for the sound.
You don't anticipate.

380
00:38:41,821 --> 00:38:44,415
- Concentrate on the sound.
You understand me?

381
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:46,890
They're gaining on you!
Go, go, go, go, go, go! Stop! Stop!

382
00:38:46,993 --> 00:38:50,121
Come on, get out.
Let's go again. Let's go again.

383
00:39:08,014 --> 00:39:10,983
<i>- Gracias. Come here, girl!
- Daddy!</i>

384
00:39:11,083 --> 00:39:13,881
Oh, I missed you so much.

385
00:39:13,986 --> 00:39:16,648
- I missed you too.
- How are you doing? I got a surprise for you.

386
00:39:16,756 --> 00:39:18,951
- You do?
- Ready?

387
00:39:19,058 --> 00:39:21,549
- Huh?
- You got me a dog! You finally got me a dog!

388
00:39:21,661 --> 00:39:25,153
<i>- Huh?
- You bought me a dog, finally! Oh, my God!</i>

389
00:39:25,264 --> 00:39:27,391
<i>- What do you think?
- Oh, my gosh.</i>

390
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:30,469
- Just what I wanted. What's his name?
- Sam, like Dad.

391
00:39:30,570 --> 00:39:33,403
Great! Come on, Sam!
Come on, Sam!

392
00:39:33,506 --> 00:39:35,474
- State.
- Mm-hmm.

393
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,908
Bhutan.
It's a Himalayan kingdom.

394
00:39:41,013 --> 00:39:44,505
<i>They were having some problems
with their royal family not that long ago.</i>

395
00:39:44,617 --> 00:39:47,347
<i>- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.</i>

396
00:39:47,453 --> 00:39:50,650
Any more questions?

397
00:39:50,756 --> 00:39:52,656
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- What?

398
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:54,749
- Do you have a girlfriend?
- No.

399
00:39:54,860 --> 00:39:57,124
<i>What kind of question is that?
You're supposed to be studying history.</i>

400
00:39:57,229 --> 00:40:00,687
- That is history. Creasy history.
- No, that's ancient history.

401
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,427
<i>- No more questions.
- Who was your very first girlfriend?</i>

402
00:40:02,535 --> 00:40:05,527
Nonya. Nonya business.
That's who.

403
00:40:05,638 --> 00:40:09,870
<i>- Okay?
- Hi.</i>

404
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:13,673
Tomorrow after you drop off Pita,
could you take me to get my hair done?

405
00:40:13,779 --> 00:40:16,509
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

406
00:40:16,616 --> 00:40:20,177
Well, um, I'll leave you two
to your history.

407
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,551
<i>- Good night.
- Good night, honey.</i>

408
00:40:27,126 --> 00:40:29,686
- Okay, now ask me.
- Ask you what?

409
00:40:36,068 --> 00:40:39,128
Go, Pita, go. Go! Go, go, go, go!

410
00:40:41,307 --> 00:40:43,798
Go, go, go, go, go.

411
00:40:43,909 --> 00:40:46,207
Bravo! Muy bien!

412
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,708
- 10.99.
- Yes!

413
00:40:49,815 --> 00:40:52,249
<i>Whoo!</i>

414
00:40:52,351 --> 00:40:55,582
- I'm tough, Creasy.
- No such thing as tough.

415
00:40:55,688 --> 00:40:58,054
There's trained,
then there's untrained.

416
00:40:58,157 --> 00:40:59,852
<i>- Now, which are you?
- Trained.</i>

417
00:40:59,959 --> 00:41:02,154
Trained. Okay. Let's go again.

418
00:41:10,102 --> 00:41:12,730
- Here.
- Stand here near the finish line.

419
00:41:12,838 --> 00:41:14,772
Okay. Hey.

420
00:41:14,874 --> 00:41:18,071
I'm a prisoner in the block
until the gunshot sets me free.

421
00:41:18,177 --> 00:41:20,577
- Don't smile, don't fool around if you want to win.
- Okay.

422
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,671
- You want to win? Trained or untrained?
- Trained.

423
00:41:22,782 --> 00:41:25,080
Go.

424
00:41:25,184 --> 00:41:29,621
<i>- Seor Creasy, nice to see you.
- Oh, good to see you, Madre.</i>

425
00:41:29,722 --> 00:41:32,623
Pita's parents are away
on business in Jurez. I was...

426
00:41:32,725 --> 00:41:35,353
Today you are her father.

427
00:42:57,877 --> 00:43:00,437
<i>Pita Ramos!</i>

428
00:43:06,185 --> 00:43:09,586
I won! Creasy! I won!

429
00:43:09,688 --> 00:43:13,283
- Okay.
- I won!

430
00:43:22,334 --> 00:43:26,668
<i>- Once upon a time, when we were young...
- When I was young.</i>

431
00:43:26,772 --> 00:43:29,866
Well, when we were young
and he was younger...

432
00:43:29,975 --> 00:43:32,705
all heads turned our way.

433
00:43:32,812 --> 00:43:35,474
We made a deal
to take the world together.

434
00:43:35,581 --> 00:43:39,415
<i>Yeah, then one day
I got a call, and he said...</i>

435
00:43:39,518 --> 00:43:42,817
"I'm in love! I'm in love!

436
00:43:42,922 --> 00:43:45,686
<i>And I'm moving to Mexico. "</i>

437
00:43:45,791 --> 00:43:48,157
<i>And... I said...</i>

438
00:43:48,260 --> 00:43:51,923
- "What happened to the plan?
What happened to it?"

439
00:43:52,031 --> 00:43:54,124
I said, "The plan's right here. "

440
00:43:54,233 --> 00:43:56,701
Yeah. Yeah. And what'd I do?

441
00:43:56,802 --> 00:43:59,202
I hung up, then I met Alicia...

442
00:43:59,305 --> 00:44:03,503
and then I went,
"Oh, now I got you! I got you. "

443
00:44:03,609 --> 00:44:06,339
I got it. Can I kiss her? Is that...

444
00:44:06,445 --> 00:44:10,074
Absolutely!
Hey, what are you doing?

445
00:44:15,788 --> 00:44:20,418
- You got me.
- Okay, I think now is a good a time as any.

446
00:44:23,329 --> 00:44:26,025
I bought it with my own money.

447
00:44:31,737 --> 00:44:33,762
Open it.

448
00:44:38,143 --> 00:44:42,603
It's St. Jude,
patron saint of lost causes.

449
00:44:42,715 --> 00:44:44,546
Wow.

450
00:44:46,485 --> 00:44:48,419
Well deserved.

451
00:44:52,658 --> 00:44:55,252
Thank you, Pita. It's beautiful.

452
00:44:56,896 --> 00:44:58,796
You're welcome.

453
00:45:47,479 --> 00:45:50,209
<i>- Dad.
- Yes, sweetie?</i>

454
00:45:50,316 --> 00:45:52,216
Can I talk to you?

455
00:45:52,318 --> 00:45:54,445
Yes.

456
00:45:54,553 --> 00:45:57,784
I don't want to play piano.
I want to swim.

457
00:45:57,890 --> 00:46:00,324
It's not open for discussion,
honey, okay?

458
00:46:00,426 --> 00:46:04,294
Mr. Lozzi's a very, very famous teacher,
and if he accepts you as his student...

459
00:46:04,396 --> 00:46:06,364
you're gonna play the piano.

460
00:46:06,465 --> 00:46:08,399
Whatever.

461
00:46:08,500 --> 00:46:10,968
Baby.

462
00:46:11,070 --> 00:46:13,630
- I love you.
- I love you.

463
00:46:13,739 --> 00:46:17,140
- I just want what's best for you, you know that?
- Okay.

464
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:19,233
Okay, honey.

465
00:46:29,688 --> 00:46:32,248
If you broke all my fingers,
then taped them back together...

466
00:46:32,358 --> 00:46:35,327
I wouldn't be able to play piano,
but I could still swim.

467
00:46:35,427 --> 00:46:37,759
Sam, get back.

468
00:46:37,863 --> 00:46:40,730
Don't be a crybaby.
You're tougher than that.

469
00:46:40,833 --> 00:46:43,301
<i>Sit, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.</i>

470
00:46:45,604 --> 00:46:49,370
- Remember the day you wanted the pencil?
- Yeah.

471
00:46:49,475 --> 00:46:51,966
I know why.

472
00:46:52,077 --> 00:46:55,535
- Yeah?
- You wanted the license number off of that car.

473
00:46:55,647 --> 00:46:58,343
I wrote it down in my notebook.

474
00:46:58,450 --> 00:47:01,214
I got it all but the last number.

475
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:04,380
I'll get it from you lat...
Can you belch?

476
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:07,550
Burp. Can you burp?

477
00:47:10,963 --> 00:47:13,295
That's good. That's very good.

478
00:47:13,399 --> 00:47:16,459
- I just had a Coke.
- All right. Listen.

479
00:47:16,568 --> 00:47:18,866
Now, this teacher,
this famous teacher...

480
00:47:18,971 --> 00:47:22,099
He teaches a lot of rich kids
and plays for the symphonies, right?

481
00:47:22,207 --> 00:47:24,835
- Right.
- You belch every few minutes while you're practicing.

482
00:47:24,943 --> 00:47:27,207
- Okay.
- You apologize to him, but you keep belching.

483
00:47:27,312 --> 00:47:29,906
- You'll offend every sensibility he has.
- Okay.

484
00:47:30,015 --> 00:47:33,746
Very good. You'll be back in the pool
in 24 hours, I guarantee you.

485
00:47:33,852 --> 00:47:36,980
Right, Sam?

486
00:47:41,427 --> 00:47:44,123
<i>- Hola.
- Lupita Ramos?</i>

487
00:47:47,733 --> 00:47:50,293
For you, Creasy.

488
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:56,403
Thank you.

489
00:47:58,777 --> 00:48:00,642
<i>- How does this look?
- Good.</i>

490
00:48:00,746 --> 00:48:04,512
- Good.
- Hmm?

491
00:48:04,616 --> 00:48:07,176
<i>- Hola, Pita.
- Hola.</i>

492
00:48:07,286 --> 00:48:09,811
- Bye.
- Bye.

493
00:48:10,923 --> 00:48:12,857
<i>Gracias.</i>

494
00:48:39,885 --> 00:48:42,285
<i>Pita.</i>

495
00:48:50,596 --> 00:48:52,723
<i>Pita!</i>

496
00:50:16,481 --> 00:50:18,540
Pita!

497
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,049
Pita!

498
00:50:31,263 --> 00:50:33,254
Pita!

499
00:50:42,274 --> 00:50:44,765
Run!

500
00:52:02,654 --> 00:52:05,054
Creasy!

501
00:52:05,157 --> 00:52:07,148
Creasy!

502
00:52:09,961 --> 00:52:12,361
Creasy. Creasy.

503
00:52:12,464 --> 00:52:14,523
Creasy!

504
00:52:26,978 --> 00:52:28,445
I can't...

505
00:52:30,716 --> 00:52:33,184
Come on!

506

<i>John W. Creasy is under arrest

508
00:52:57,309 --> 00:52:59,106

Everybody relax, okay?
Relax, Sammy.

512
00:55:13,945 --> 00:55:15,913
I know she's your little girl.

513
00:55:16,014 --> 00:55:20,110
When I tell you everything's gonna be
all right, everything's gonna be all right.

I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

<i>Victor Fuentes, Anti-Kidnapping Division,
Policia Judicial.</i>

Excuse me. I'm Jordan Kalfus.
I'm the family attorney.

518
00:55:42,908 --> 00:55:47,868
Speak slower, please.
My Russian is better than my English.

519
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:52,780
Well, I'm conducting the negotiations, and
we neither need nor want police assistance.

520
00:55:52,884 --> 00:55:56,547
We're gonna...
We're gonna handle this thing ourselves.

<i>Seor Ramos,
two police officers were killed...</i>

522
00:56:00,692 --> 00:56:02,557

00:56:03,962 --> 00:56:08,763
<i>I have a written order
from Ministerio Publico...</i>

If you want to speak to
Attorney General Diaz, it's on me.

00:56:21,913 --> 00:56:23,881
No. Okay.

527
00:56:23,982 --> 00:56:28,078
The kidnapper will tell you
to deliver the money alone.

528
00:56:28,186 --> 00:56:30,780
<i>Por favor, don't do that...</i>

529
00:56:30,889 --> 00:56:34,017
or you will find yourself
in a real Mexican hell.

00:56:34,125 --> 00:56:37,754
No mariachi.
No tequila... and no Pita.

531
00:57:18,069 --> 00:57:21,004
<i>Crease.</i>

532
00:57:21,106 --> 00:57:23,802
Crease.

533
00:57:23,908 --> 00:57:28,072
<i>When I heard it was
this hospital, I was so pleased.</i>

534
00:57:28,179 --> 00:57:31,410
There is a pastry shop nearby.

535
00:57:31,516 --> 00:57:34,849
Delgado's. They have
the best pastries in Mexico.

536
00:57:34,953 --> 00:57:38,480
Oh, Miguel Manzano...

537
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:41,218
director of the A.F. I...

538
00:57:41,326 --> 00:57:46,025
and a former director of Interpol...

539
00:57:46,131 --> 00:57:47,928
in Rome.

540
00:57:48,033 --> 00:57:51,434
- And you are?
- Friend of his. Rayburn.

541
00:57:51,536 --> 00:57:54,505
Rayburn?

542
00:58:06,351 --> 00:58:07,943
<i>Hola.</i>

543
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:11,580
Do you love your daughter,
Seor Ramos?

544
00:58:11,690 --> 00:58:13,783
Yes. Yes.

545
00:58:13,892 --> 00:58:17,089
<i>- Do you want to see her again?
- Yes, I do.</i>

546
00:58:17,195 --> 00:58:20,926
Seor, if your daughter's life...

547
00:58:21,032 --> 00:58:24,399
is as important to you
as it is to me...

548
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:26,868
you will do as I say.

549
00:58:26,971 --> 00:58:30,566
- Yes?
- Okay. Yes.

550
00:58:30,675 --> 00:58:33,371
- Crease. Can you hear me?
- Hmm.

551
00:58:36,915 --> 00:58:39,110
You got four of them. All dead.

552
00:58:41,352 --> 00:58:43,980
- Pita.
- It's, uh...

553
00:58:46,157 --> 00:58:50,617
It's been two days.
They're negotiating a ransom.

554
00:58:52,831 --> 00:58:56,494
These things take time, Mr. Creasy.

555
00:59:00,405 --> 00:59:02,737
Crease.

556
00:59:04,943 --> 00:59:07,912
Don't fuck with me, all right?

557
00:59:13,752 --> 00:59:17,119
Do you have the 10 million?
Do you have the money?

558
00:59:17,222 --> 00:59:21,682
- Yes, we have the money.
- Now if you do as I say...

559
00:59:21,793 --> 00:59:25,991
the girl will be returned
exactly as she was taken.

560
00:59:26,097 --> 00:59:29,430
<i>But if you deviate from
the process in any way...</i>

561
00:59:32,103 --> 00:59:34,901
I swear,
you will never see her again.

562
00:59:35,006 --> 00:59:37,975
<i>I understand. Listen, I-I too worship
la Virgin de Guadalupe.</i>

563
00:59:38,076 --> 00:59:39,873
I ask you if you understand.

564
00:59:42,747 --> 00:59:46,012
Hello, sir.
This is, uh, Mr. Ramos's attorney.

565
00:59:46,117 --> 00:59:49,348
<i>He's going through a very difficult
time here, but he understands.</i>

566
00:59:49,454 --> 00:59:52,912
<i>Do you understand?
Repeat the drop instructions.</i>

567
00:59:53,024 --> 00:59:56,460
<i>Okay, the money, 10 million,
U.S., will be divided into...</i>

568
00:59:56,561 --> 00:59:59,758
<i>two 15-gallon black canvas bags,
each containing five million...</i>

569
00:59:59,864 --> 01:00:02,332
<i>which will be checked
at the bank by the K.R. Agent...</i>

570
01:00:02,433 --> 01:00:06,870
<i>then driven to the house in an armored car
where it will be transferred to the delivery car.</i>

571
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:10,498
You got a flat tire here.

572
01:00:10,608 --> 01:00:13,907
This is for you.

573
01:00:14,012 --> 01:00:16,173
Hello. Yeah.

574
01:00:16,281 --> 01:00:18,841
Listen, I need a driver
to drive Samuel.

575
01:00:18,950 --> 01:00:21,180
<i>No. Why?</i>

576
01:00:21,286 --> 01:00:25,086
He's got a bad ticker.
He's got a heart condition.

577
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:28,353
Look, he's a nervous kid
who doesn't respond well to stress.

578
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:35,156
All right.
But the car will not be powerful.

579
01:00:35,266 --> 01:00:40,397
Remove the trunk lid.
Use the maid's Valiant Acapulco.

580
01:00:40,505 --> 01:00:44,942
<i>You will arrive at
La Diana Fountain at 1:00 a. m.</i>

581
01:00:45,043 --> 01:00:49,912
You will drive around
the circle two times.

582
01:00:50,014 --> 01:00:54,212
<i>Samuel will remove his shirt
and hold it out the window...</i>

583
01:00:54,319 --> 01:00:56,219
to I.D. The car.

584
01:00:58,857 --> 01:01:01,417
<i>There is a pay phone
on the southeast corner.</i>

585
01:01:01,526 --> 01:01:06,964
<i>The phone will ring.
He will answer and wait for instructions.</i>

586
01:01:08,600 --> 01:01:11,899
<i>There is a map on the top of the phone.
Follow it.</i>

587
01:01:15,039 --> 01:01:16,904
<i>Perfecto.</i>

588
01:01:21,145 --> 01:01:24,205
- What are you doing? He said no phones!
- Relax. Relax.

589
01:01:24,315 --> 01:01:27,807
- I'm just trying to protect your daughter.
- Just get me there, please.

590
01:01:32,190 --> 01:01:37,150
- What's going on?
- Hospitals can be very dangerous places.

591
01:01:37,262 --> 01:01:41,130
Especially when you have
killed two corrupt cops.

592
01:01:53,511 --> 01:01:57,641
<i>Leave the money
in the trunk of the white car.</i>

593
01:01:57,749 --> 01:02:00,047
<i>Then return to your car.</i>

594
01:02:01,519 --> 01:02:03,578
<i>Do not look back.</i>

595
01:02:22,874 --> 01:02:26,935
<i>Remember, I'm a professional.</i>

596
01:02:27,045 --> 01:02:31,175
<i>If you keep your word,
I will keep mine.</i>

597
01:02:44,295 --> 01:02:46,320
- Hello.
- Mr. Ramos.

598
01:02:46,431 --> 01:02:49,958
<i>You betrayed me.
You killed my nephew.</i>

599
01:02:50,068 --> 01:02:52,195
You took my money.

600
01:02:52,303 --> 01:02:56,740
<i>Seor Ramos...</i>

601
01:02:58,676 --> 01:03:04,137
All right. Get out of here, all of you.
Get the fuck out of my house!

602
01:03:04,248 --> 01:03:06,512
Okay, this is Lisa.

603
01:03:09,287 --> 01:03:12,085
I'm Pita's mother.

604
01:03:12,190 --> 01:03:16,456
And I'm very sorry for whatever happened
to your nephew, but I beg you...

605
01:03:20,198 --> 01:03:24,362
This conversation
is not being recorded.

606
01:03:26,938 --> 01:03:31,898
I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.
I wish we had talked sooner, senora.

607
01:03:32,010 --> 01:03:35,275
I'm really sorry.

608
01:03:35,380 --> 01:03:39,407
Now it is too late.

609
01:03:47,959 --> 01:03:52,419
Fuck off! Get the fuck out
of my fucking house now!

610
01:03:53,831 --> 01:03:56,197
Get out! Get out!

611
01:04:37,608 --> 01:04:39,576
Hey.

612
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:44,437
<i>Hey.</i>

613
01:04:44,549 --> 01:04:47,450
Hey, Ray.

614
01:04:49,854 --> 01:04:53,654
- Where am I?
- Well, it looks like a dog hospital.

615
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,927
Manzano was afraid the cops
were gonna kill you.

616
01:05:02,967 --> 01:05:05,435
How ya doin', Doc?

617
01:05:08,840 --> 01:05:10,671
What's the matter?

618
01:05:15,046 --> 01:05:17,207
She's de... dead, Crease.

619
01:05:19,917 --> 01:05:21,817
<i>It's a mess.</i>

620
01:05:21,919 --> 01:05:24,285
<i>Somebody hijacked the drop,
and, uh...</i>

621
01:05:27,925 --> 01:05:30,052
<i>the kidnapper's nephew was killed...</i>

622
01:05:30,161 --> 01:05:32,629
so he k... he killed Pita.

623
01:06:04,061 --> 01:06:06,086
No.

624
01:06:13,371 --> 01:06:15,339
No.

625
01:06:21,045 --> 01:06:24,071
Did you recognize any of these men?

626
01:06:25,583 --> 01:06:29,849
No. Does that make me a suspect?

627
01:06:29,954 --> 01:06:32,582
No.

628
01:06:32,690 --> 01:06:34,715
It would be convenient, but no.

629
01:06:34,825 --> 01:06:38,784
Um, maybe you should show me
some pictures of some Mexican cops.

630
01:06:38,896 --> 01:06:42,859
- Maybe we'll get somewhere then.
- Those were all policemen.

631
01:06:42,967 --> 01:06:45,094
Bad judicial cops.

632
01:06:46,270 --> 01:06:50,206
Protected by a brotherhood.

633
01:06:50,308 --> 01:06:52,208
Brotherhood?

634
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:59,038
<i>A brotherhood called La Hermandad.</i>

635
01:07:12,263 --> 01:07:14,731
You all set?

636
01:07:14,832 --> 01:07:17,892
- Hmm?
- Right arm. Here.

637
01:07:20,871 --> 01:07:23,499
- Okay?
- Yeah. I'm all right.

638
01:07:23,608 --> 01:07:25,667
Let's go.

639
01:08:02,413 --> 01:08:07,146
- Somebody's on us.
- Yeah. Lois Lane.

<i>- Who?
- Mariana something, works for Reforma.</i>

<i>Newspaper journalist.</i>

642
01:08:13,557 --> 01:08:16,890
Maybe she thinks you're a scoop.

643
01:08:18,929 --> 01:08:21,159
I'll get you up to the border.

644
01:08:21,265 --> 01:08:24,723
A friend of mine will take you to San Diego,
drop you right at the naval hospital.

645
01:08:24,835 --> 01:08:30,330
- I'm not going, Ray.
- What are you gonna do?

646
01:08:30,441 --> 01:08:33,535
Let's take a ride by the crime scene.
She can follow us.

01:10:06,170 --> 01:10:09,264
Open it.

I can help you.

<i>There's a brotherhood

It protects high-ranking

660
01:10:46,343 --> 01:10:49,710
and organized crime at a level
that is too difficult for me to reach.

661
01:10:51,449 --> 01:10:53,349
Okay.

662
01:10:53,451 --> 01:10:58,286
And I think that you and Lupita Ramos

That's right.

01:12:01,018 --> 01:12:02,918
You'll be stateside by supper time.

676
01:12:03,020 --> 01:12:05,818
I'm gonna need some help
first though, Ray.

677
01:12:05,923 --> 01:12:08,858
<i>If you don't stop bleeding,
you won't last a day the shape you're in.</i>

678
01:12:08,959 --> 01:12:12,395
- Is that a yes or is that a no?
- Yeah.

679
01:12:12,496 --> 01:12:15,260
But I'm done killing.
I told you that.

680
01:12:15,366 --> 01:12:17,266
- Okay.
- Anything else is yours.

681
01:12:23,741 --> 01:12:27,268
- You're talking about war.
- Exactly what I'm talking about.

682
01:12:27,378 --> 01:12:30,074
Can you help me?

683
01:12:30,180 --> 01:12:32,978
- Yeah.
- Good.

684
01:13:47,524 --> 01:13:49,754
<i>Creasy.</i>

685
01:14:08,078 --> 01:14:09,978
Hmm.

686
01:14:44,581 --> 01:14:46,879
- What are you doing here?
- Oh.

687
01:14:54,224 --> 01:14:56,954
Came to get my stuff.

688
01:14:57,061 --> 01:14:59,529
Couldn't find my Bible.
I thought it might be in here.

689
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:04,090
- I borrowed it.
- Okay.

690
01:15:06,070 --> 01:15:08,231
It's crazy, huh?

691
01:15:08,338 --> 01:15:11,034
One week we're figuring out
which nightclub to go to...

692
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:14,133
and the next thing
I'm reading the Bible.

693
01:15:14,244 --> 01:15:17,975
It's a good thing.
You hold on to it.

694
01:15:22,352 --> 01:15:27,380
I keep thinking,
if only we hadn't...

695
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,988
It's like, um...

696
01:15:34,498 --> 01:15:36,898
my whole life,
all I've ever thought about...

697
01:15:37,000 --> 01:15:40,993
was what I could get for myself.

698
01:15:41,105 --> 01:15:44,563
Even with my own baby.

699
01:15:46,443 --> 01:15:50,402
She needed me so much,
and sometimes...

700
01:15:50,514 --> 01:15:54,314
I felt like I had nothing to give her.

701
01:15:54,418 --> 01:15:57,046
Just, um, I don't know what to do.

702
01:15:59,757 --> 01:16:03,193
<i>- What are you gonna do?
- What I do best.</i>

703
01:16:03,293 --> 01:16:05,261
I'm gonna kill 'em.

704
01:16:06,697 --> 01:16:09,165
Anyone who was involved.
Anybody who profited from it.

705
01:16:09,266 --> 01:16:11,860
Anybody who opens their eyes at me.

706
01:16:13,470 --> 01:16:16,166
You kill 'em all.

707
01:16:43,667 --> 01:16:45,498
<i>Yla Browning.</i>

708
01:17:26,370 --> 01:17:30,238
<i>Hola.</i>

709
01:17:30,341 --> 01:17:32,400
<i>Yeah, it's me.</i>

710
01:17:32,510 --> 01:17:35,570
- Mr. Creasy.
- Okay. I need the license...

711
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:37,408
Well, no, excuse me.

712
01:17:37,515 --> 01:17:41,042
I need the name and address of someone
whose license number is...

713
01:17:41,151 --> 01:17:42,709
C-5-T-K-8.

714
01:17:42,820 --> 01:17:46,051
That's C-5-T-K-8.

715
01:17:46,156 --> 01:17:49,387
I got everything but the last digit,
so I need 10 possible matches.

716
01:17:49,493 --> 01:17:52,621
And when do I find out
which of the 10 it is?

717
01:17:52,730 --> 01:17:55,460
- Eventually.
- Well, where do I reach you?

718
01:17:55,566 --> 01:17:59,229
I'll call you.

719
01:18:17,054 --> 01:18:20,023
Jordan, Angola, Lebanon.
Yes, I know all of that.

720
01:18:20,124 --> 01:18:25,426
He's an assassin. And you want to help him
identify the owner of a car for him?

721
01:18:35,606 --> 01:18:38,302
<i>- Mariana.
- S.</i>

722
01:18:47,351 --> 01:18:49,683
<i>Gracias.</i>

723
01:18:51,288 --> 01:18:53,188
Ciao.

724
01:19:26,757 --> 01:19:29,555
Now, Jorge Gonzales.

725
01:19:36,767 --> 01:19:38,792
Okay.

726
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:06,629
<i>What are you gonna do?
What are you gonna do?</i>

727
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:08,698
<i>What I do best.</i>

728
01:20:10,467 --> 01:20:12,935
<i>Anyone who was involved.

729
01:20:13,037 --> 01:20:15,597
<i>Anybody who opens their eyes at me,

730
01:20:27,051 --> 01:20:29,110
Oh, God!

01:20:57,881 --> 01:21:00,372
<i>"Oye Como Va. "</i>

732
01:21:23,040 --> 01:21:25,008
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

733
01:21:32,149 --> 01:21:34,049
<i>Okay? Ahora.</i>

734
01:21:37,921 --> 01:21:40,116
Huh? You know who I am?

735
01:21:47,598 --> 01:21:49,623
Correct.

736
01:21:49,733 --> 01:21:51,428
Okay.

737
01:21:51,535 --> 01:21:53,765
Hey, hey, hey.

738
01:22:36,180 --> 01:22:38,045
<i>No s nada.</i>

739
01:22:56,266 --> 01:22:58,928
<i>No s! No s!</i>

740
01:23:18,488 --> 01:23:20,115
<i>Hmm?</i>

741
01:23:27,898 --> 01:23:30,765
<i>La Voice.</i>

742
01:23:50,153 --> 01:23:52,644
Okay.

743
01:23:52,756 --> 01:23:56,055
Okay.

744
01:25:12,736 --> 01:25:15,398
Okay. Well.

745
01:25:15,505 --> 01:25:17,564
<i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

746
01:25:17,674 --> 01:25:20,973
Give me one cigarette, please.

747
01:25:21,078 --> 01:25:23,546
<i>- S.
- Okay.</i>

748
01:25:28,685 --> 01:25:30,983
<i>Bueno?</i>

749
01:25:32,923 --> 01:25:37,553
Okay, my friend.
It's off to the next life for you.

750
01:25:39,062 --> 01:25:42,498
I guarantee you,
you won't be lonely.

751
01:26:06,757 --> 01:26:10,284
<i>Revenge is a meal best served cold.</i>

752
01:27:49,593 --> 01:27:51,686
<i>- La nia.
- No.</i>

753
01:27:51,795 --> 01:27:54,025
<i>No? Vamos.</i>

754
01:28:57,194 --> 01:28:59,185
No?

755
01:29:02,065 --> 01:29:03,896
Hmm?

756
01:29:14,978 --> 01:29:18,277
I heard you speaking Spanish.
You're American, right?

757
01:29:18,381 --> 01:29:20,246
- And so are you.
- Yeah.

758
01:29:20,350 --> 01:29:22,818
- Get out of here. Where are you from?
- I'm from New Jersey.

759
01:29:22,919 --> 01:29:24,284
<i>- You from New Jersey?
- Yeah.</i>

760
01:29:24,387 --> 01:29:26,617
I'm from New Jersey.
All right, listen to me.

761
01:29:29,960 --> 01:29:32,588
<i>All right. Everything
is done up by cell phone.</i>

762
01:29:32,696 --> 01:29:35,961
You just wait around for calls,
and we don't even have a fucking number.

763
01:29:36,066 --> 01:29:38,091
Who pays you?

764
01:29:38,201 --> 01:29:43,264
We got an A.T.M. Card. We take out 200
fucking measly dollars every two weeks.

765
01:29:45,008 --> 01:29:46,942
- Two hundred dollars?
- Yeah.

766
01:29:47,043 --> 01:29:49,341
- What's the PI N number?
- The what?

767
01:29:49,446 --> 01:29:51,277
The PI N number.
Code number.

768
01:29:55,051 --> 01:29:57,315
- Yeah.
- Good. You wouldn't lie to me, right?

769
01:29:57,420 --> 01:29:59,820
- I'm not lying, man.
- Did you kill her? You didn't kill her, did you?

770
01:29:59,923 --> 01:30:01,948
No.

771
01:30:04,094 --> 01:30:07,029
Don't lie to me. Don't lie to me!
Did you kill her?

772
01:30:07,130 --> 01:30:08,859
Oh, man, you're making me
fucking nervous.

773
01:30:08,965 --> 01:30:11,866
- Did you kill her?
- No way. The fucking boss did, or his brother.

774
01:30:14,604 --> 01:30:17,300
- We never see his face.
- You're not lying to me, are you?

775
01:30:17,407 --> 01:30:19,637
No. Goddamn it! I'm telling you the truth!

776
01:30:19,743 --> 01:30:22,268
Tell me, who?
You never see whose face?

777
01:30:22,379 --> 01:30:24,711
<i>Well, we were in the other room...</i>

778
01:30:24,814 --> 01:30:28,045
<i>and he was yellin' at the girl
'cause his nephew got killed...</i>

779
01:30:28,151 --> 01:30:30,551
<i>and the money got stolen.</i>

780
01:30:30,654 --> 01:30:32,554
Wait, wait. Wh-What?
Somebody stole what money?

781
01:30:32,656 --> 01:30:35,454
- The ransom money at the drop.
- Who? Who stole it?

782
01:30:35,558 --> 01:30:37,958
- He said some fuckin' crooked cop took it.
- Who?

783
01:30:38,061 --> 01:30:40,222
- Fuentes.
- Fuentes?

784
01:30:40,330 --> 01:30:42,389
<i>Yeah, that's right.</i>

785
01:30:42,499 --> 01:30:45,127
<i>All right? Huh? Jersey boy?</i>

786
01:30:45,235 --> 01:30:49,137
Yeah. Now.

787
01:30:50,407 --> 01:30:53,069
<i>- This Fuentes guy?
- Yeah.</i>

788
01:30:53,176 --> 01:30:55,576
<i>He's a lieutenant for
the Anti-Kidnapping Division.</i>

789
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,170
Fuentes is. What'd you do?

790
01:30:58,281 --> 01:31:00,841
- Oh, man.
- Tell me about the girl. What'd you do?

791
01:31:00,950 --> 01:31:03,510
<i>- Huh? What'd you do?
- I just do what they told me.</i>

792
01:31:03,620 --> 01:31:05,019
- You do what they tell you to do?
- Yeah.

793
01:31:05,121 --> 01:31:07,589
Did you say good-bye to her?
Answer my question.

794
01:31:07,691 --> 01:31:09,682
- Did you say good-bye to her?
- No!

795
01:31:09,793 --> 01:31:12,261
- You didn't? Here's your chance. Say good-bye.
- Oh, shit!

796
01:31:12,362 --> 01:31:15,092
Say good-bye to her.
Say good-bye to her.

797
01:31:15,198 --> 01:31:17,325
Fucking let me go!

798
01:31:19,969 --> 01:31:22,335
Rico?

799
01:32:03,513 --> 01:32:05,413
Okay. Okay.

800
01:32:22,365 --> 01:32:23,889
<i>- No?
- No.</i>

801
01:32:41,551 --> 01:32:43,382
<i>S.</i>

802
01:32:46,089 --> 01:32:48,353
<i>S.</i>

803
01:34:23,486 --> 01:34:25,613
<i>- S, Guerrero.
- Listen, it's me.</i>

804
01:34:25,722 --> 01:34:28,816
Yeah, it's me. You know anything about
a young girl being kidnapped recently?

805
01:34:28,925 --> 01:34:32,088
- She's about 12 years old?
- Yes, that's last night.

806
01:34:32,195 --> 01:34:33,924
- Do you know something?
- What's her name?

807
01:34:34,030 --> 01:34:36,021
Uh, Camilla. Camilla Valencias.

808
01:34:36,132 --> 01:34:39,431
<i>Camilla?
Se llama Camilla?</i>

809
01:34:39,536 --> 01:34:41,367
<i>- S.
- Okay. I got her.</i>

810
01:34:41,471 --> 01:34:44,201
Where are you?

811
01:35:13,937 --> 01:35:16,735
<i>- Creasy, what happened?
- It's okay.</i>

812
01:35:16,839 --> 01:35:18,807
Sit down. Relax.

813
01:35:18,908 --> 01:35:21,741
She's okay. She's okay.
You got banking connections?

814
01:35:21,844 --> 01:35:25,245
Yes, I have connections.

815
01:35:26,950 --> 01:35:30,181
Okay. The PI N number's 4747.

816
01:35:30,286 --> 01:35:33,778
I wanna find out who's
putting money in that account.

817
01:35:33,890 --> 01:35:37,451
4747.

818
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,994
What do you know
about a cop named Fuentes?

819
01:35:40,096 --> 01:35:42,326
He's with the Anti-Kidnapping Division.

820
01:35:42,432 --> 01:35:44,832
<i>He's the one who drove
Samuel Ramos to the drop.</i>

821
01:35:44,934 --> 01:35:46,526
- Fuentes?
- S.

822
01:35:46,636 --> 01:35:50,629
<i>- Who is she?
- You can ask her later. She'll tell you anything.</i>

823
01:35:50,740 --> 01:35:53,538
- What do you know about him?
About Fuentes?

824
01:35:53,643 --> 01:35:57,044
Three years ago they caught him with $50,000
and a dead body in the trunk of his car.

825
01:35:57,146 --> 01:35:58,841
<i>- Huh.
- Never charged.</i>

826
01:35:58,948 --> 01:36:01,815
Arresting officer couldn't testify
'cause he was dead.

827
01:36:03,419 --> 01:36:05,819
<i>- Is he La Hermandad?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

828
01:36:05,922 --> 01:36:09,449
- You know where he lives?
- He lives in a judicial compound.

829
01:36:11,394 --> 01:36:14,295
He travels by motorcade.

830
01:36:17,667 --> 01:36:20,033
<i>Creasy, he's better protected
than the president of Mexico.</i>

831
01:36:20,136 --> 01:36:22,400
He's gonna need it.
You gonna take care of her?

832
01:36:22,505 --> 01:36:25,030
- Yes. Well, how can I find you?
- I'll find you.

833
01:36:52,802 --> 01:36:56,738
This is my jurisdiction.

834
01:36:56,839 --> 01:37:01,242
I want this man as much as Creasy does.

835
01:37:01,344 --> 01:37:06,407
He'll deliver more justice in a weekend
than 10 years of your courts and tribunals.

836
01:37:06,516 --> 01:37:09,849
- Just stay out of his way.
- I plan to.

837
01:37:17,293 --> 01:37:20,751
I will even help him, if I can.

838
01:37:20,863 --> 01:37:25,027
But, uh, I would like to
understand him.

839
01:37:26,869 --> 01:37:28,530
Give me that.

840
01:37:28,638 --> 01:37:31,266
Pita Ramos...

841
01:37:32,842 --> 01:37:34,742
that's a number to you.

842
01:37:34,844 --> 01:37:39,781
You know, one more dead,
but a number.

843
01:37:39,882 --> 01:37:42,476
What was she to Creasy then?

844
01:37:42,585 --> 01:37:45,418
She showed him
it was all right to live again.

845
01:37:48,558 --> 01:37:52,619
And the kidnappers
took that away, huh?

846
01:37:52,729 --> 01:37:56,688
And they're gonna wish
they never touched a hair on her head.

847
01:37:58,267 --> 01:38:01,464
A man can be an artist...

848
01:38:04,373 --> 01:38:07,001
in anything... food, whatever.

849
01:38:07,110 --> 01:38:11,672
It depends on how good he is at it.

850
01:38:15,084 --> 01:38:16,984
Creasy's art is death.

851
01:38:19,856 --> 01:38:23,656
He's about to paint his masterpiece.

852
01:38:31,033 --> 01:38:33,501
I don't have anything else to say.

853
01:40:02,124 --> 01:40:04,752
Shh. Shh.

854
01:40:23,312 --> 01:40:25,644
Forgiveness is between them and God.

855
01:40:25,748 --> 01:40:28,649
It's my job to arrange the meeting.

856
01:42:25,001 --> 01:42:27,731
Don't move.
Put your hands down. Put 'em down.

857
01:42:36,445 --> 01:42:39,073
<i>Seor John W. Creasy...</i>

858
01:42:39,181 --> 01:42:42,673
<i>is under arrest for the murder
of two officers of the Judicial Police.</i>

859
01:42:44,787 --> 01:42:47,881
<i>He's suspected
of possible involvement...</i>

860
01:42:47,990 --> 01:42:51,448
<i>of possible involvement in
the kidnapping of Lupita Ramos.</i>

861
01:43:21,457 --> 01:43:24,255
Can you hear me? Huh?

862
01:43:25,895 --> 01:43:27,863
Know where we are?

863
01:43:29,098 --> 01:43:33,467
We're under the bridge
where the deal went bad.

864
01:43:33,569 --> 01:43:38,336
The ransom got stolen.
You wanna tell me what happened?

865
01:43:38,441 --> 01:43:41,103
<i>- Have you heard of La Hermandad?
- Yes, I have.</i>

866
01:43:41,210 --> 01:43:43,110
<i>- Do you know what it is?
- Yes.</i>

867
01:43:43,212 --> 01:43:45,339
<i>I'm the president of La Hermandad.</i>

868
01:43:45,448 --> 01:43:47,143
- You're the president?
- Yes.

869
01:43:47,249 --> 01:43:49,342
<i>The president? Wow.</i>

870
01:43:49,452 --> 01:43:51,511
Look at me.

871
01:43:52,788 --> 01:43:55,188
Oh, you can't.
I'm sorry.

872
01:43:55,291 --> 01:43:57,350
How's that?

873
01:44:05,901 --> 01:44:07,869
Let me show you what I got here.

874
01:44:09,805 --> 01:44:13,332
See this? This is a charger. It's used
by convicts to hide money and drugs.

875
01:44:13,442 --> 01:44:17,139
They stick it in their body.
They tuck it up their rectum.

876
01:44:17,246 --> 01:44:20,477
You familiar with that?
This... Look at me.

877
01:44:20,583 --> 01:44:23,347
Pencil detonator.

878
01:44:23,452 --> 01:44:27,183
Timer, used as a receiver-transmitter.

879
01:44:27,289 --> 01:44:30,315
C-4. Highly explosive.

880
01:44:30,426 --> 01:44:32,656
You put 'em all together,
you got a bomb.

881
01:44:32,761 --> 01:44:35,321
Not very sophisticated,
but very powerful.

882
01:44:37,533 --> 01:44:40,161
That's what you have in your ass right now.

883
01:44:40,269 --> 01:44:43,636
Don't move. Don't move.
Don't move.

884
01:44:47,910 --> 01:44:50,378
Cheap watch. Pager watch.

885
01:44:50,479 --> 01:44:56,111
Used to send a page to the receiver
that's up your behind right now.

886
01:44:56,218 --> 01:44:59,415
<i>So, I'm gonna send you a page...</i>

887
01:44:59,522 --> 01:45:01,422
which you will receive...

888
01:45:04,593 --> 01:45:07,084
in five minutes.

889
01:45:07,196 --> 01:45:09,426
Now.

890
01:45:14,270 --> 01:45:16,670
You got less than five minutes
to tell me what went down...

891
01:45:16,772 --> 01:45:19,900
between your men and the kidnapper.

892
01:45:20,009 --> 01:45:21,840
I have nothing to do with the kidnapper.

893
01:45:21,944 --> 01:45:24,572
- Four minutes and 30 seconds.
- Nothing. I don't know him.

894
01:45:24,680 --> 01:45:28,377
<i>You don't know?
Four minutes and 25 seconds.</i>

895
01:45:30,519 --> 01:45:32,510
Four minutes and 20 seconds.
Are you sure?

896
01:45:35,357 --> 01:45:38,224
Okay.

897
01:45:38,327 --> 01:45:41,558
I got all the time in the world.
You don't, but I do.

898
01:45:41,664 --> 01:45:44,428
- Hey, relax, relax, buddy.
- I'm relaxed.

899
01:45:44,533 --> 01:45:47,400
You got three minutes, 59 seconds.

900
01:45:47,503 --> 01:45:50,267
I saw the opportunity,
and I got lucky.

901
01:45:50,372 --> 01:45:51,862
And?

902
01:45:51,974 --> 01:45:55,068
And I had my men ready as we
got instructions where to go.

903
01:45:55,177 --> 01:45:57,111
You had your men ready
to steal the drop.

904
01:45:57,213 --> 01:45:59,647
<i>You had your men ready to kill
one of the kidnappers, yeah?</i>

905
01:45:59,748 --> 01:46:02,273
<i>You've done this many times.</i>

906
01:46:04,186 --> 01:46:07,485
- One of the nephews of the head kidnapper...
- Bingo. Bingo. Bingo.

907
01:46:07,590 --> 01:46:10,650
- Bingo, yeah. You've done this many times, huh?
- Many times, yeah.

908
01:46:10,759 --> 01:46:14,092
- Yeah. Killed many victims too, haven't you?
- Come on, sir.

909
01:46:14,196 --> 01:46:17,165
- We just make out as best we can.
- "As best we could"?

910
01:46:20,236 --> 01:46:23,330
Two minutes, 47 seconds.

911
01:46:24,807 --> 01:46:28,072
Wait-Wait a minute. Come on.

912
01:46:28,177 --> 01:46:30,441
<i>- I have a little gift for you.
- For me?</i>

913
01:46:30,546 --> 01:46:33,344
- Yeah. Come on. Come on.
- What do you got?

914
01:46:33,449 --> 01:46:37,579
<i>There was no $10 million.
There was one half in the bags.</i>

915
01:46:37,686 --> 01:46:40,416
The ransom was $10 million?
They put it in two bags.

916
01:46:40,522 --> 01:46:42,649
- Five million in each bag, right?
- Two bags, true.

917
01:46:42,758 --> 01:46:46,285
<i>But one has half paper...</i>

918
01:46:46,395 --> 01:46:49,489
<i>the other only paper.</i>

919
01:46:49,598 --> 01:46:53,500
Maybe your men stole it.

920
01:46:53,602 --> 01:46:56,093
Whoever did it
took it before the exchange.

921
01:46:58,140 --> 01:47:01,109
Okay. At the Ramos house...

922
01:47:01,210 --> 01:47:05,840
before the exchange,
who put the bags in the car?

923
01:47:05,948 --> 01:47:08,212
- Guess what.
- What?

924
01:47:08,317 --> 01:47:11,616
Ramos lawyer, Jordan Kalfus.

925
01:47:11,720 --> 01:47:14,188
- Jordan Kalfus?
- Yeah.

926
01:47:16,825 --> 01:47:19,293
Pedro.

927
01:47:26,568 --> 01:47:29,059
Sir? Please.

928
01:47:29,171 --> 01:47:31,867
I- I'm sorry.
I'm really sorry for the girl.

929
01:47:31,974 --> 01:47:35,967
It was just business.
You know, I'm a professional.

930
01:47:36,078 --> 01:47:39,377
That's what everybody keeps saying.
"I'm just a professional. "

931
01:47:39,481 --> 01:47:42,279
Everybody keeps saying that to me.
"I'm just a professional. I'm just a professional. "

932
01:47:42,384 --> 01:47:45,410
I'm getting sick and tired of hearing that.
You understand me?

933
01:47:48,824 --> 01:47:51,759
What are you going to do now?

934
01:47:51,860 --> 01:47:53,987
What am I gonna do?
I'm gonna leave. I gotta go.

935
01:47:54,096 --> 01:47:57,259
- Yeah. I got...
- Come on. Come on. What about me, huh?

936
01:47:57,366 --> 01:48:00,335
- What about you? You got 40 seconds.
- Come on.

937
01:48:00,436 --> 01:48:04,873
- Thirty-five.
- A last wish, please. Please.

938
01:48:04,973 --> 01:48:10,206
Last wish?
I wish you had more time.

939
01:48:10,312 --> 01:48:14,408
Hey! Hey, hey!

940
01:50:16,905 --> 01:50:20,534
Hola.

941
01:50:20,642 --> 01:50:23,270
<i>- Mariana, it's me.
- Creasy, where are you?</i>

942
01:50:23,378 --> 01:50:26,040
Listen, I got something
that looks like banking codes...

943
01:50:26,148 --> 01:50:28,013
from Bank Coast in the Cayman Islands.

944
01:50:28,116 --> 01:50:31,244
- I need it translated as fast as you can.
- Whose account is it?

945
01:50:31,353 --> 01:50:35,449
<i>Jordan Kalfus, and it looks like
U.S. Deposits and withdrawals.</i>

946
01:50:35,557 --> 01:50:37,491
<i>Give me the same thing
on Samuel Ramos.</i>

947
01:50:37,593 --> 01:50:41,324
Samuel Ramos. That's it?

948
01:50:41,430 --> 01:50:43,159
- That's it.
- Okay.

949
01:51:18,400 --> 01:51:20,300
<i>Gracias.</i>

950
01:51:28,744 --> 01:51:32,373
- Creasy.
- Samuel.

951
01:51:32,481 --> 01:51:34,472
<i>Honey?</i>

952
01:51:38,086 --> 01:51:40,452
What's going on?

953
01:51:42,257 --> 01:51:46,284
That's what I wanna know.
What is going on?

954
01:51:48,730 --> 01:51:51,631
<i>Huh, Sam?</i>

955
01:51:51,733 --> 01:51:53,963
I'm gonna ask your wife a couple
of questions, okay?

956
01:51:54,069 --> 01:51:57,004
You move...

957
01:51:57,105 --> 01:51:59,130
<i>you make one sound...</i>

958
01:51:59,241 --> 01:52:02,335
I'll snatch the life right outta you,
you understand?

959
01:52:09,651 --> 01:52:12,347
What happened, Lisa, hmm?

960
01:52:12,454 --> 01:52:14,354
Were you in on this?

961
01:52:14,456 --> 01:52:18,620
- Or was it just your husband, huh?
- Am I in on what?

962
01:52:18,727 --> 01:52:22,254
You know what I'm talking about... Pita's
kidnapping, her death. Were you a part of it?

963
01:52:22,364 --> 01:52:25,663
- Pita got killed because the ransom got stolen.
- Shut up!

964
01:52:27,202 --> 01:52:29,568
Yeah, the money was stolen.
You're right. He's right.

965
01:52:29,671 --> 01:52:33,198
The money was stolen by Victor Fuentes.
How much was stolen though, huh?

966
01:52:33,308 --> 01:52:36,300
- $2.5 million, right?
- What are you talking about?

967
01:52:36,411 --> 01:52:39,539
He knows what I'm talking about.
$2.5 million. That's what Victor got, isn't it?

968
01:52:39,648 --> 01:52:42,640
- What are you talking about?
- 2.5 million.

969
01:52:42,751 --> 01:52:45,049
<i>2.5 million to your lawyer
Jordan Kalfus...</i>

970
01:52:45,153 --> 01:52:48,281
that he put in an account in the Cayman
Islands, but he won't get a chance to spend it.

971
01:52:51,627 --> 01:52:53,959
What happened to the other five, Sam?

972
01:52:54,062 --> 01:52:56,997
<i>Huh? That's 2.5, 2.5.
What is five from 10?</i>

973
01:52:57,099 --> 01:52:59,624
That's five. What happened
to the other five, Sam? Tell your wife.

974
01:52:59,735 --> 01:53:02,169
<i>- It's your chance to talk.
What happened to the other five?</i>

975
01:53:02,270 --> 01:53:03,635
- You got a wife, Creasy?
- No, I don't have a wife.

976
01:53:03,739 --> 01:53:06,503
Then you'll never know how hard
it could be to tell your wife the truth.

977
01:53:06,608 --> 01:53:08,838
No, you have a wife!
You tell me what happened!

978
01:53:08,944 --> 01:53:11,071
It was in this room
that my father prayed.

979
01:53:11,179 --> 01:53:13,875
- I don't give a fuck about your fucking father!
- My father prayed.

980
01:53:13,982 --> 01:53:17,884
He prayed that his gambling debts and his
infidelities would be forgiven right in this room.

981
01:53:17,986 --> 01:53:20,682
- Samuel! I love you!
- What, Lisa?

982
01:53:20,789 --> 01:53:24,589
- Tell me the truth.
- I didn't inherit a kingdom! That's the truth!

983
01:53:24,693 --> 01:53:27,594
You wanna know the truth?
I inherited his debt and his mess.

984
01:53:27,696 --> 01:53:30,597
- I inherited his lawyer Jordan...
- You tell me what happened to my baby!

985
01:53:30,699 --> 01:53:33,259
Say it! Say it! Say it!

986
01:53:33,368 --> 01:53:35,996
Say it! Say it! Be a fucking man!

987
01:53:39,808 --> 01:53:42,242
Jordan told me she'd sit in a room...

988
01:53:42,344 --> 01:53:44,744
and watch cartoons all day...

989
01:53:44,846 --> 01:53:47,713
and she'd eat ice cream
and we'd have her back in two days.

990
01:53:47,816 --> 01:53:50,410
He lied to me!

991
01:53:50,519 --> 01:53:53,386
That's why he's fucking dead!
I did it!

992
01:53:53,488 --> 01:53:55,547
I did it, Lisa!

993
01:53:55,657 --> 01:53:58,387
I agreed to the kidnapping.

994
01:53:58,493 --> 01:54:01,929
I did it for us...
for the three of us.

995
01:54:10,372 --> 01:54:12,499
I'm so sorry, Lisa.

996
01:54:18,513 --> 01:54:20,481
You kill him.

997
01:54:21,883 --> 01:54:23,783
You kill him or I will.

998
01:54:54,149 --> 01:54:56,117
Huh. You know, they say a, um...

999
01:54:58,520 --> 01:55:01,648
<i>a bullet always tells the truth.</i>

1000
01:55:10,932 --> 01:55:12,900
It never lies.

1001
01:55:25,881 --> 01:55:30,147
It didn't work for me, Samuel, but maybe...

1002
01:55:32,420 --> 01:55:34,980
Maybe it'll work for you.

1003
01:55:44,299 --> 01:55:46,893
<i>I'll pray for you.</i>

1004
01:58:49,351 --> 01:58:51,251
<i>Gracias.</i>

1005
01:59:16,044 --> 01:59:17,944
- Hola?
- Hola.

1006
01:59:18,046 --> 01:59:20,537
<i>- Mr. Creasy?
- Yeah, it's me.</i>

1007
01:59:20,648 --> 01:59:22,709
<i>I traced the PIN for you
and I have an address.</i>

1008
01:59:23,810 --> 01:59:24,810
<i>Yeah?</i>

1009
01:59:24,819 --> 01:59:28,277
<i>The cardholder is Reina Rosas Sanchez,
the wife of The Voice. "</i>

1010
01:59:28,390 --> 01:59:32,656
<i>She lives in Los Arcos,
apartment 26D, Via Appia.</i>

1011
01:59:32,761 --> 01:59:35,229
<i>- Good.
- And another thing.</i>

1012
01:59:35,330 --> 01:59:39,130
<i>Pick up today's paper and you'll have
a picture of The Voice. "</i>

1013
01:59:39,234 --> 01:59:41,202
<i>Good. Thank you.</i>

1014
02:00:44,199 --> 02:00:46,292
Shh, shh, shh.

1015
02:01:49,764 --> 02:01:51,698
<i>Jos? Qu te pasa?</i>

1016
02:03:06,774 --> 02:03:08,605
<i>S.</i>

1017
02:03:08,710 --> 02:03:10,678
Okay.

1018
02:03:18,253 --> 02:03:20,016
Hmm?

1019
02:03:26,527 --> 02:03:27,994
Hmm?

1020
02:03:39,107 --> 02:03:41,007
<i>S.</i>

1021
02:03:41,109 --> 02:03:43,100
Okay. Uh...

1022
02:03:47,448 --> 02:03:49,348
<i>- S?
- S.</i>

1023
02:03:56,557 --> 02:03:59,185
Aurelio Rosas Sanchez. Okay.

1024
02:04:04,065 --> 02:04:05,965
Okay.

1025
02:04:14,409 --> 02:04:16,343
<i>S.</i>

1026
02:04:16,444 --> 02:04:18,844
<i>S.</i>

1027
02:04:18,946 --> 02:04:20,880
Huh?

1028
02:05:17,739 --> 02:05:19,707
<i>Momento.</i>

1029
02:05:49,370 --> 02:05:51,304
<i>Hola, Daniel.</i>

1030
02:05:51,406 --> 02:05:53,271
Seor Creasy.

1031
02:05:53,374 --> 02:05:56,741
Yeah. Yeah, I got your family here.

1032
02:05:56,844 --> 02:05:59,404
<i>Your brother doesn't look too good.</i>

1033
02:05:59,514 --> 02:06:02,779
<i>Yeah, Reina, she's what,
about eight months?</i>

1034
02:06:02,884 --> 02:06:06,945
<i>Huh? You wanna negotiate?</i>

1035
02:06:10,858 --> 02:06:14,521
The most important thing
in life is family.

1036
02:06:14,629 --> 02:06:16,824
<i>Do you agree?</i>

1037
02:06:18,032 --> 02:06:19,932
I agree.

1038
02:06:21,736 --> 02:06:24,204
And there you are.
You have my family.

1039
02:06:24,305 --> 02:06:27,172
Well, most of my family.

1040
02:06:27,275 --> 02:06:31,439
<i>My wife and I are separated.
You know how that is.</i>

1041
02:06:31,546 --> 02:06:35,312
Now, tell me seriously,
h- how much do you want?

1042
02:06:35,416 --> 02:06:37,179
Ah.

1043
02:06:39,720 --> 02:06:42,211
Your brother wants to speak to you.
Yeah, hold on.

1044
02:06:53,301 --> 02:06:56,464
I'm gonna take your family apart
piece by piece. You understand me?

1045
02:06:56,571 --> 02:06:58,630
Piece by piece. Shut up!

1046
02:06:59,841 --> 02:07:02,639
<i>I don't want your money!</i>

1047
02:07:02,743 --> 02:07:06,372
Do you understand me?
You understand me? I want you.

1048
02:07:39,514 --> 02:07:41,607
I'm listening.

1049
02:07:43,050 --> 02:07:46,417
<i>I'm listening, Daniel. I'm listening.</i>

1050
02:07:52,627 --> 02:07:55,926
<i>All right,
I will give you a life for a life.</i>

1051
02:07:57,532 --> 02:08:00,092
Whose life?
What are you talking about?

1052
02:08:00,201 --> 02:08:02,965
<i>Whose life, Daniel? I want you.</i>

1053
02:08:03,070 --> 02:08:06,562
I will give you her life for your life.

1054
02:08:06,674 --> 02:08:11,134
And in exchange,
I will get my life back.

1055
02:08:11,245 --> 02:08:15,238
- What life? Whose life?
- The girl's. Pita's.

1056
02:08:19,153 --> 02:08:23,317
- Pita's dead.
- Creasy!

1057
02:08:23,424 --> 02:08:28,760
<i>I'm a businessman.
A girl dead is worth nothing. She's alive.</i>

1058
02:08:33,067 --> 02:08:35,035
All right.

1059
02:08:36,971 --> 02:08:39,166
I want proof of life. You hear me?

1060
02:08:39,273 --> 02:08:42,242
I want proof of life.
I want... I want...

1061
02:08:42,343 --> 02:08:44,777
I want the name of her bear.
What does she call her bear?

1062
02:08:44,879 --> 02:08:47,507
<i>You tell her to tell you...</i>

1063
02:08:47,615 --> 02:08:51,142
to tell me what she calls her bear.

1064
02:09:19,947 --> 02:09:22,541
- Yeah?
- Creasy.

1065
02:09:22,650 --> 02:09:25,642
<i>She calls the bear Creasy Bear.</i>

1066
02:09:41,569 --> 02:09:43,537
Okay.

1067
02:09:45,373 --> 02:09:47,967
O- Okay.

1068
02:09:48,075 --> 02:09:50,635
I give you your brother,
you give me the girl.

1069
02:09:52,380 --> 02:09:54,712
- All right.
- Where?

1070
02:10:38,392 --> 02:10:40,292
Hello?

1071
02:10:40,394 --> 02:10:43,056
Lisa, listen to me. Don't hang up.

1072
02:10:43,164 --> 02:10:45,359
I think Pita's alive.

1073
02:10:47,168 --> 02:10:49,398
I can't take this anymore.

1074
02:10:49,503 --> 02:10:51,437
Take the road to Puebla.

1075
02:10:51,539 --> 02:10:54,406
Get off junction 34, south side.

1076
02:10:54,508 --> 02:10:56,533
I'll meet you there in two hours.

1077
02:11:41,856 --> 02:11:43,756
So where is she?

1078
02:11:46,293 --> 02:11:49,421
She's right over there.
You see those two cars out there?

1079
02:11:54,735 --> 02:11:58,000
Pita's kidnapper, Daniel...

1080
02:11:58,105 --> 02:12:01,438
this is his brother.

1081
02:12:02,810 --> 02:12:04,937
Here.

1082
02:12:05,045 --> 02:12:08,776
I'm goin' up on the bridge to get Pita.

1083
02:12:08,883 --> 02:12:11,647
<i>If anything goes wrong,
you put it to his head.</i>

1084
02:12:13,220 --> 02:12:15,347
You pull the trigger, all right?

1085
02:12:16,390 --> 02:12:18,915
You understand?

1086
02:12:21,996 --> 02:12:24,362
You don't...

1087
02:12:24,465 --> 02:12:27,730
Let him loose until she's with you.

1088
02:12:27,835 --> 02:12:29,803
You got it?

1089
02:12:32,273 --> 02:12:34,935
And you don't wait for me, okay?

1090
02:12:37,678 --> 02:12:39,407
Yeah.

1091
02:12:39,513 --> 02:12:43,074
- You'll be all right. You okay?
- Yeah.

1092
02:14:28,255 --> 02:14:30,155
Creasy!

1093
02:14:31,926 --> 02:14:33,894
Creasy!

1094
02:14:35,062 --> 02:14:37,530
Creasy!

1095
02:14:53,814 --> 02:14:56,214
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1096
02:14:56,317 --> 02:14:59,013
They didn't hurt you?

1097
02:14:59,119 --> 02:15:01,451
Hi.

1098
02:15:04,191 --> 02:15:08,491
Your mother's waitin' for you. She's right
down there at the end of the bridge.

1099
02:15:08,595 --> 02:15:12,224
- Okay? You go home.
- Okay.

1100
02:15:12,333 --> 02:15:15,063
- All right.
- Where are you goin'?

1101
02:15:18,939 --> 02:15:21,407
I'm goin' home too.

1102
02:15:22,443 --> 02:15:24,343
I'm goin' to Blue Bayou.

1103
02:15:28,615 --> 02:15:31,243
Oh, Hey.

1104
02:15:31,352 --> 02:15:34,685
I got something for you.

1105
02:15:36,757 --> 02:15:38,748
I got the last number too.

1106
02:15:38,859 --> 02:15:41,692
I love you, Creasy.

1107
02:15:44,198 --> 02:15:46,860
And you love me, don't you?

1108
02:15:47,968 --> 02:15:50,061
Yes, I do.

1109
02:15:50,170 --> 02:15:53,367
With all my heart. Pita, go.

1110
02:15:53,474 --> 02:15:55,442
- Go. Run.
- Bye.

1111
02:16:08,989 --> 02:16:10,889
<i>Vamos!</i>

1112
02:16:10,991 --> 02:16:14,256
- Pita! Baby, come here. It's okay.
- Mom!

1113
02:16:14,361 --> 02:16:17,558
<i>- Mom!
- Come on! Okay, I'll let you go now.</i>

1114
02:16:17,664 --> 02:16:19,723
<i>Mom!</i>
