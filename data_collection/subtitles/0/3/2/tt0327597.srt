1
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,464
We're here! Time to muscle up.

2
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:17,116
Hello?

3
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:20,382
Who's there?

4
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:01,228
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.

5
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,560
I'm just looking for
an old well. Know it?

6
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:10,869
Not talking, huh?

7
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,378
Magic dowser, magic dowser,

8
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,210
show me the well!

9
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,389
Get away from me!

10
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,266
Ooh.

11
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,711
Let me guess. You're from Texas or Utah,
someplace dried-out and barren, right?

12
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,873
I heard about water witching
before, but it doesn't make sense.

13
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,612
- I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.
- It's a dowsing rod.

14
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,744
Ow!

15
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:59,656
And I don't like being stalked,
not by psycho nerds or their cats!

16
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:03,492
He's not really my cat. He's
kind of feral. You know, wild.

17
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,690
Of course, I do feed him every night,

18
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:09,758
and sometimes he'll come to my window
and bring me little dead things.

19
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,134
Look, I'm from Pontiac.

20
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,498
Huh?

21
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:18,840
Michigan. And if I'm a water
witch, then where's the secret well?

22
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,680
You stomp too hard
and you'll fall in it.

23
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:22,806
Oh!

24
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,841
See?

25
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,454
It's supposed to be so deep, if you
fell to the bottom and looked up,

26
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:35,016
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.

27
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:36,453
Ha!

28
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,526
Surprised she let you move in.

29
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:43,933
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace.
Won't rent to people with kids.

30
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,837
What do you mean?

31
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:50,365
I'm not supposed to talk about
it. I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

32
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,204
- Wybie?
- Short for Wyborne.

33
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,912
Not my idea, of course.
What'd you get saddled with?

34
00:06:56,983 --> 00:07:00,077
I wasn't saddled with
anything. It's Coraline.

35
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,614
- Caroline what?
- Coraline. Coraline Jones.

36
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:07,921
It's not real scientific, but I
heard an ordinary name like Caroline

37
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,394
can lead people to have ordinary
expectations about a person.

38
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:13,191
Wyborne!

39
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,894
I think I heard someone
calling you, Wyborne.

40
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:21,429
- What? I didn't hear anything.
- I definitely heard someone,

41
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:23,841
Why-Were-You-Born.

42
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,143
Wyborne!
- Grandma!

43
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:34,444
Well, great to meet a
Michigan water witch,

44
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:37,888
but I'd wear gloves next time.

45
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,790
- Why?
- 'Cause that dowsing rod of yours,

46
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,260
it's poison oak.

47
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,625
I almost fell down a
well yesterday, Mom.

48
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:18,959
Uh-huh.

49
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,932
I would've died.

50
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,335
That's nice.

51
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,460
Hmm.

52
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:28,637
So, can I go out? I think it's
perfect weather for gardening.

53
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,939
No, Coraline. Rain makes
mud. Mud makes a mess.

54
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,781
But, Mom, I want stuff growing
when my friends come to visit.

55
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,782
Isn't that why we moved here?

56
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:41,718
Something like that. But
then we had the accident.

57
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:45,355
- It wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
- I never said it was.

58
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,016
I can't believe it.

59
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,256
You and Dad get paid to write
about plants, and you hate dirt.

60
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,127
Coraline, I don't have
time for you right now,

61
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,794
and you still have unpacking
to do. Lots of unpacking.

62
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,394
That sounds exciting!

63
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,697
Oh. Some kid left this
on the front porch.

64
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,408
<i>Hey, Jonesy. Look what I
found in Gramma's trunk.</i>

65
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,608
<i>Look familiar? Wybie.</i>

66
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:14,680
Huh.

67
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,587
A little me? That's weird.

68
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,382
What's his name, anyway?

69
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,394
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

70
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,665
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

71
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:35,765
Dad!

72
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,844
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.

73
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,383
Do you know where the garden tools are?

74
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,284
It's... It's pouring
out there, isn't it?

75
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,849
- It's just raining.
- What'd the boss say?

76
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:56,417
"Don't even think about
going out, Coraline Jones!"

77
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,593
Then you won't need the tools.

78
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:13,936
You know, this house is 150 years old.

79
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,146
- So?
- So explore it.

80
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:21,016
Go out and count all the doors and
windows and write that down on...

81
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,579
List everything that's
blue. Just let me work.

82
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,360
Ew!

83
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,388
No. No, no, no. No.

84
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:21,097
One boring blue boy in a
painfully boring painting.

85
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,511
Four incredibly boring windows

86
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:30,312
and no more doors.

87
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,387
All right, little me.
Where are you hiding?

88
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:46,458
Huh?

89
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,699
Hey, Mom. Where does this door go?

90
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,469
I'm really, really busy.

91
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:57,941
I think it's locked.

92
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,505
Please!

93
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:14,118
Will you stop pestering
me if I do this for you?

94
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:17,220
Fine.

95
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,743
Bricks? I don't get it.

96
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:41,009
They must've closed this off
when they divided up the house.

97
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,078
You're kidding. And why
is the door so small?

98
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,023
We made a deal! Zip it!

99
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,353
You didn't lock it.

100
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,005
<i>Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl</i>

101
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,271
<i>I think you are so nice I
give you bowls of porridge</i>

102
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,470
<i>And I give you bowls of ice cream</i>

103
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:09,947
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

104
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,778
Coraline, we've been
through this before.

105
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,412
Your dad cooks, I clean,
and you stay out of the way.

106
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:19,890
I swear I'll go food shopping
soon as we finish the catalog.

107
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,154
Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.

108
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:24,526
It looks more like slime to me.

109
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:29,125
Well, it's slime or bedtime,
fusspot. Now what's it gonna be?

110
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,002
Think they're trying to poison me?

111
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,516
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

112
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,436
Good night, little me.

113
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:10,362
Whoa!

114
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:31,645
Huh?

115
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:44,601
Mmm. Something smells good.

116
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,741
Mom? What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

117
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,411
You're just in time for supper, dear.

118
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:08,048
You're not my mother.
My mother doesn't have...

119
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,564
Buttons? Do you like them?

120
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,827
I'm your other mother, silly.

121
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:19,200
Now go tell your other
father that supper's ready.

122
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,806
Well, go on. He's in his study.

123
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:32,910
Hello?

124
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:35,220
Hello, Coraline.

125
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,422
Wanna hear my new song?

126
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:42,087
- My father can't play piano.
- No need to.

127
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,625
This piano plays me.

128
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:54,171
<i>Making up a song about Coraline</i>

129
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:58,175
<i>She's a peach, she's a
doll She's a pal of mine</i>

130
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,076
<i>She's as cute as a button
in the eyes of everyone</i>

131
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:05,310
<i>Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline</i>

132
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,618
<i>When she comes around exploring Mom
and I will never, ever make it boring</i>

133
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:13,715
<i>Our eyes will be on Coraline</i>

134
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:18,991
I'm sorry, but she said to
tell you the food's ready.

135
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,053
Mmm.

136
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,100
Who's starving? Raise your hand.

137
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,156
Whoa!

138
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:41,519
We give our thanks and ask to bless
our mother's golden chicken breast.

139
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,760
Mmm!

140
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:57,029
This chicken is good.
- Hungry, aren't you?

141
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,934
- Do you have any gravy?
- Well, here comes the gravy train.

142
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:03,770
Choo, choo!

143
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,407
Huh.

144
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,920
Another roll? Sweet
peas? Corn on the cob?

145
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,450
I'm real thirsty.

146
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,687
Of course. Any requests?

147
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:24,587
Mango milkshake?

148
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,443
- Home?
- We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

149
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,312
For me? Yep.

150
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:46,943
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.

151
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,748
I didn't know I had another mother.

152
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,653
Of course you do. Everyone does.

153
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,524
- Really? Uh
-huh.

154
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:57,426
And soon as you're through
eating, I thought we'd play a game.

155
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,460
You mean like
hide-and-seek?

156
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:06,368
Perfect. Hide-and-seek
in the rain.

157
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,598
What rain?

158
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,274
- What about the mud?
- We love mud here.

159
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,406
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.

160
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,514
- It's great for poison oak.
- How'd you know I...

161
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:27,418
.. I'd love to play, but I better
get home to my other mother.

162
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,460
But I'm your other mother.

163
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:33,931
I mean my other, other
mother. Mom number one?

164
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,132
I think I should get to bed.

165
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,603
Of course, sweetheart. It's all made up.

166
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:42,970
- But...
- Come along, sleepyhead.

167
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,485
Wow. Hello, Coraline.

168
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,284
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

169
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,985
- What's shaking, baby?
- Hello.

170
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,332
<i>Hey. How's it going, Loper?</i>

171
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,336
<i>Where's your swampers and chook?</i>

172
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,202
Cripes almighty! How are my best trolls?

173
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,300
I can't wait till summer.
You're both coming, right?

174
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,471
<i>- We're already here, Coraline.
- Gone to Oregon.</i>

175
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:25,914
Oh.

176
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:28,016
The mud.

177
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:40,291
- See you soon.
- See you soon.

178
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:10,857
It's gone. My poison oak! It's gone!

179
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,326
Huh.

180
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,137
It was incredibly real, Mom.

181
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,176
Only you weren't really you.
You were my other mother.

182
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,040
Buttons for eyes, huh?

183
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,172
Coraline, you only dreamed
you ate all that chicken.

184
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,840
Take your multivitamin at least.

185
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,179
You were in the dream, too, Dad.

186
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,846
You had wild-Iooking pajamas
and orange monkey slippers.

187
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,750
Orange? My monkey slippers are blue.

188
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:44,262
Psst! Can you get me some of that
magic mud you were talking about?

189
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,355
Because I have a terrible
case of writer's rash on my...

190
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:53,937
If the real Charlie Jones
wants his pages edited,

191
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:56,200
he better wrap them up ASAP.

192
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,103
Coraline, why don't
you go visit downstairs?

193
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,808
I bet those actresses would
love to hear your dream.

194
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:08,649
Miss Spink and Forcible? But
you said they're dingbats.

195
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:10,151
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:26,894
Bobinsky. Bobinsky. Bobinsky.

197
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:52,093
Hello?

198
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,396
I think our mail got mixed up.

199
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,368
Should I leave it outside, or...

200
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:10,278
Hmm.

201
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:13,779
Secret!

202
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,279
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready,

203
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:21,750
little girl.

204
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,759
Circus?

205
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:24,987
Oh, uh...

206
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:27,531
I brought this for you.

207
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,531
Huh?

208
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:37,734
New cheese samples.

209
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:46,918
<i>Very clever using this mix-up to
sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?</i>

210
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:49,244
<i>- Mooshkas?
- The mice!</i>

211
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,414
Oh!

212
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,823
Sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

213
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:57,752
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.

214
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,691
But you call me Mr. B

215
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,759
because amazing I
already know that I am.

216
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:13,976
Ha!

217
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:19,779
You see, Caroline, the problem
is... My new songs go oompah, oompah,

218
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:23,548
but the jumping mice play
only toodle-toot, like that.

219
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:27,217
Is nice but not so much amazing.

220
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:31,956
So now, I switch to stronger
cheese and soon, watch out!

221
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,058
Here, have beet. Make you strong.

222
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:42,867
<i>Do svidaniya, Caroline.</i>

223
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:46,273
Coraline.

224
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,342
Oompah, oompah.
Toodle-toot. Toodle-toot.

225
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,115
Hey, Caroline!

226
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,718
Wait!

227
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:00,917
No!

228
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,458
The mice asked me to give you message.

229
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,592
The jumping mice?

230
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:15,038
They are saying do not
go through little door.

231
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,299
Do you know such a thing?

232
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:23,973
The one behind the wallpaper?
But it's all bricked up.

233
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,242
Bah. So sorry. Is nothing.

234
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,488
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.

235
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,617
They even get your name wrong, you know?

236
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,788
They call you Coraline
instead of Caroline.

237
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:42,856
Not Caroline at all.
Maybe I work them too hard.

238
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,574
Cease your infernal yapping.

239
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,770
How nice to see you, Caroline.

240
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,576
Would you like to come
in? We're playing cards.

241
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,776
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

242
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,183
Miriam! Put the kettle on!

243
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,262
April, I think you're being followed.

244
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,997
It's the new neighbor, Miriam. Caroline.

245
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,797
She'll be having the oolong tea.

246
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:59,571
No! Oh, no, no. I'm sure
she'd prefer jasmine.

247
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,612
No, oolong.

248
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,342
Ah. Jasmine it is, then.

249
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:10,016
Come on, boys.

250
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,722
Are those dogs real?

251
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,223
Our sweet departed angels.

252
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:27,601
Couldn't bear to part with
them, so we had them stuffed.

253
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,266
Now, there's Hamish the third...

254
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,476
Go on. Have one.

255
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:37,345
It's hand-pulled taffy from
Brighton. Best in the world.

256
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,509
the third, the ninth,
yes. The fourth, I'm right.

257
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,884
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr.,
Jock the third, the fourth,

258
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,318
and that's Jock's second
cousin thrice removed.

259
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,254
I'll read them if you like.

260
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,592
- Read what?
- Your tea leaves, dear.

261
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:59,399
They'll tell me your
future. Drink up then. Go on.

262
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:04,465
No, not all of it. Not all of it.
That's right. Now hand it over.

263
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,211
Oh!

264
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,415
Oh, Caroline.

265
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,509
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

266
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,146
You are in terrible danger.

267
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:21,453
Oh, give me that cup,
April. Your eyes are going.

268
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,757
My eyes? You're blind as a bat.

269
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:28,162
Well, not to worry, child.

270
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:34,496
It's good news. There's a tall,
handsome beast in your future.

271
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,006
- A what?
- Miriam, really.

272
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:41,637
You're holding it wrong. See? Danger.

273
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,010
What do you see?

274
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,073
I see a very peculiar hand.

275
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,244
I see a giraffe.

276
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,755
Giraffes don't just fall
from the sky, Miriam.

277
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,881
Oh, Lord.

278
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,423
Well, what should I do?

279
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:58,962
Never wear green in your dressing room.

280
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,590
Acquire a very tall stepladder.

281
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,964
And be very, very careful.

282
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,703
Now, was there something
you came to tell us?

283
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:14,040
No. I guess not. Thanks
for the tea, though.

284
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,307
Toodle-oo.
Cheery-bye.

285
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,281
Do you have any nice queens for Mummy?

286
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,749
Danger?

287
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,436
Great! The village stalker.

288
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:46,568
Ow!

289
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,807
I wasn't stalking you.
We're hunting banana slugs.

290
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,611
What do you mean "we?"

291
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:59,217
Ha! Your cat's not
wild. He's a wuss puss.

292
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,191
What? He hates to get
his feet wet. Jeez.

293
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:03,591
Wuss puss.

294
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:11,661
So, that doll. Did you
make it look like me?

295
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,261
Oh, no. I found it that way.

296
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:18,402
It's older than Grandma.
Old as this house, probably.

297
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:22,207
Come on. Blue hair, my
swampers and raincoat?

298
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,511
Dang! Check out Slugzilla.

299
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,417
You're just like them.

300
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:30,946
Huh?

301
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,185
I meant my parents. They
don't listen to me either.

302
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:35,886
Uh-huh. You mind?

303
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,695
Hmm.

304
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:44,826
Ew!

305
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:55,412
You know, I've never been
inside the Pink Palace.

306
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,107
You're kidding.

307
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,947
Grandma'd kill me. Thinks
it's dangerous or something.

308
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,310
Dangerous?

309
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,721
- Well, she had a twin sister.
- So?

310
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,690
When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.

311
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,787
She says she was stolen.

312
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,663
Stolen?

313
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:17,796
Well, what do you think?

314
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,535
I don't know. Maybe she just ran away.

315
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:23,664
Wyborne!

316
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,309
- Look, I gotta go.
- Wait a minute.

317
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,379
- Welcome back, darling.
- Hi.

318
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:49,017
So thoughtful of you to send
this nice cheddar, Coraline.

319
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,688
Cheddar? Oh! The mice bait.

320
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:57,868
Would you go fetch your father? I
bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

321
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,300
You mean my other father.

322
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,272
Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.

323
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,366
But my parents don't
have time to garden.

324
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,870
Mmm!

325
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:10,436
Go on.

326
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,836
Oh!

327
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:03,398
Hey.

328
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,364
I love your garden!

329
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,362
Our garden, Coraline.

330
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:15,506
Stop tickling me!

331
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:19,279
Daughter in distress.

332
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,395
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.

333
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:42,398
Well, she says it's time
for dinner, breakfast, food.

334
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,933
Hop on, kiddo. I wanna
show you something.

335
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,279
I can't believe you did this.

336
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,221
Mother said you'd like it.

337
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,488
Boy, she knows you like
the back of her hand.

338
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,764
Mmm. So good.

339
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,393
I love
dinner-breakfast-food.

340
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,664
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you

341
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,400
to come see the jumping
mice perform after dinner.

342
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:20,672
Really? That know-it-all Wybie
said it was all in Mr. B's head.

343
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,939
I knew he was wrong.

344
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,709
Well, everything's right
in this world, kiddo.

345
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:29,845
Your father and I will clean up while
you and your friend head upstairs.

346
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:31,286
My friend?

347
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:38,224
Great. Another Wybie.
Hello, Why-Were-You-Born.

348
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:41,660
Hello!

349
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:46,936
I thought you'd like him more if he
spoke a little less. So I fixed him.

350
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,999
- So he can't talk at all?
- Nope.

351
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,468
Hmm.

352
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,874
I like it.

353
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,573
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.

354
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:04,086
You're awful cheerful considering
you can't say anything.

355
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,386
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

356
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,669
Whoa!

357
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:27,638
Cool!

358
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,754
Look at you!

359
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:54,737
Lady and gentleman, for to
tickle your eyes and ears

360
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,837
and making hearts to thump,

361
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:01,639
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky,

362
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:05,045
am introducing my astoundishing,

363
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,781
stupendulous and amazing

364
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,547
jumping mouse circus!

365
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:18,389
My name!

366
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:42,950
It's wonderful, Wybie.

367
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:00,161
Wow!

368
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,720
Yahoo! That was great!

369
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:27,219
Very, very thank you,
lady and gentleman.

370
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:47,445
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so... So...

371
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,883
Ah...

372
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,113
Amazing!

373
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:55,591
You are very welcome anytime you like.
You and also your good friend there.

374
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,357
<i>Do svidaniya, Coraline.</i>

375
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:45,205
There were garden squash like
balloon animals and snapdragons.

376
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,643
Oh, and upstairs, I
saw a real mouse circus.

377
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,203
Not pretend like the
crazy man's in our house.

378
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,909
You sure you won't come?

379
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,850
Don't fret, Charlie.
They'll love the new catalog.

380
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,911
At least they'll love my chapters.

381
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:01,048
I did not call him crazy,
Coraline. He's drunk.

382
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,895
Well, I guess I'll see you
around, you dizzy dreamer.

383
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,760
Dad! I'm not five anymore.

384
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:37,115
My kingdom for a horse!

385
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,135
Put them back.

386
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:56,908
But, Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
boring gray clothes. No one will have these.

387
00:41:57,548 --> 00:41:59,106
Put them back.

388
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,052
My other mother would get them.

389
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:05,748
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

390
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,355
So what do you think is
in the other apartment?

391
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:16,195
I don't know. Not a
family of Jones imposters.

392
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,065
- Then why'd you lock the door?
- Oh!

393
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:23,470
I found some rat crap, and
I thought you'd feel safer.

394
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:28,501
They're jumping mice, Mom, and
the dreams aren't dangerous.

395
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,639
They're the most fun I've
had since we've moved here.

396
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:35,947
- Your school might be fun.
- With those stupid uniforms? Right.

397
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:39,051
Had to give it a try.

398
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:56,299
How do you feel about a mustard,
ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?

399
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,102
Are you kidding me?

400
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:03,343
Had to go food shopping, anyway.
Dad's planning something special.

401
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,279
Grossgusting.

402
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,182
You wanna come along? You can
pick out something you like.

403
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,220
Oh. Like the gloves.

404
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:16,291
Look, Coraline, if things go well
today, I promise I'll make it up.

405
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:18,953
That's what you always say.

406
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:23,756
Won't be long.

407
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:26,670
But I might be.

408
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,906
I knew it was real.

409
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,027
<i>Dearest Coraline,</i>

410
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:38,234
<i>Miss Spink and Miss Forcible have
invited you downstairs after lunch.</i>

411
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:42,074
<i>I hope you like the new outfit
I made you. Love, Mother.</i>

412
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,450
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.

413
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,894
Not the quiet Wybie. The
one that talks too much.

414
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:04,928
You must be the other cat.

415
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,995
No, I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

416
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,404
Um... I can see you
don't have button eyes,

417
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,037
but if you're the same
cat, how can you talk?

418
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:18,614
I just can.

419
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,083
Cats don't talk at home.

420
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,516
- No?
- Nope.

421
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:26,352
Well, you're clearly the
expert on these things.

422
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,984
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.

423
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:35,226
Come back. Please? I'm sorry
I called you that. I really am.

424
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,596
How'd you get here?

425
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,329
I've been coming here for a while.

426
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,237
It's a game we play.

427
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:48,702
She hates cats and tries to keep me out,

428
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:52,579
but she can't, of course.
I come and go as I please.

429
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,617
The other mother hates cats?

430
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,779
Not like any mother I've ever known.

431
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,187
What do you mean? She's amazing.

432
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:06,123
You probably think this world is a
dream come true, but you're wrong.

433
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,494
The other Wybie told me so.

434
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,726
That's nonsense. He can't talk.

435
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,894
Perhaps not to you.

436
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:17,339
We cats, however, have far
superior senses than humans,

437
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:19,773
and can see and smell and...

438
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,502
Shh!

439
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:26,038
I hear something. Right over...

440
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:08,455
Hey, Wybie.

441
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,698
She's practically naked!

442
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:28,734
<i>I'm known as the siren of all seven seas</i>

443
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:32,543
<i>The breaker of hearts by the bay</i>

444
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:36,609
<i>So if you go swimming
With bowlegged women</i>

445
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:40,851
<i>I might steal your weak heart away</i>

446
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,901
Oh, my God.

447
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:58,999
<i>A big-bottomed sea witch
May bob through the waves</i>

448
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,637
<i>And hope to lead sailors astray</i>

449
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:08,276
<i>But a true ocean goddess
Must fill out her bodice</i>

450
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:13,517
<i>To present an alluring display</i>

451
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:23,257
<i>Oh! Beware of old oysters
too large in the chest</i>

452
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:27,099
<i>Let's banish them from the buffet</i>

453
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,161
<i>I'm far more nutritious</i>

454
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,400
<i>You smell like the fishes</i>

455
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,602
<i>Did I hear a banshee?</i>

456
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,009
<i>You're sea green with envy</i>

457
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,240
<i>This mermaid enchantress</i>

458
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,807
<i>No, I, Birth of Venus</i>

459
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,718
<i>- Will send sailors swooning...
- Will send sailors swooning all day</i>

460
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,909
I can't look.

461
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:19,547
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

462
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,922
Our lives for the theater, April.

463
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:48,278
"What a piece of work is
man! How noble in reason!"

464
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,479
"How infinite in faculty."

465
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:54,957
"In form, in moving how
express and admirable!"

466
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:57,755
"In action like an angel."

467
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:02,695
"In apprehension how like a god!"

468
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,764
"The beauty of the world!"

469
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,939
"The paragon of animals!"

470
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:18,171
Yeah!

471
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,108
Hey, there.

472
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,913
Was it wonderful, dear?

473
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:59,183
Oh, yeah. They swooped down and
pulled me right out of my seat,

474
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,622
Spink and Forcible, only
they weren't old ladies.

475
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:06,321
That was just a disguise. But then, I
was flying through the air, and it was...

476
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,920
It was magic.

477
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,193
You do like it here,
don't you, Coraline?

478
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,700
Uh-huh.

479
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:13,429
Good night, Wybie.

480
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,840
You could stay here
forever if you want to.

481
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:28,909
- Really?
- Sure.

482
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:32,716
We'll sing and play games, and
Mother will cook your favorite meals.

483
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,349
There's one tiny little
thing we need to do.

484
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,155
- What's that?
- Well, it's a surprise.

485
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,694
For you, our little doll.

486
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:52,405
Black is traditional.

487
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:58,977
But if you'd prefer pink or
vermillion or chartreuse...

488
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,551
Though you might make me jealous.

489
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,747
No way! You're not
sewing buttons in my eyes!

490
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,950
But we need a "yes" if
you want to stay here.

491
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,822
So sharp you won't feel a...

492
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:11,952
Ow!

493
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,826
There, now. It's your decision, darling.

494
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,163
We only want what's best for you.

495
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,603
I'm going to bed. Right now!

496
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,765
- Bed?
- Before dinner?

497
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,401
I'm really, really tired. Yeah.

498
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,638
I just need to sleep on things.

499
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,741
Well, of course you do, darling.
I'll be happy to tuck you in.

500
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,582
Oh, no, thanks. You've
done so much already.

501
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,680
You're welcome. And I...

502
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,050
We aren't worried at all, darling.

503
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,393
Soon you'll see things our way.

504
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:09,114
What's wrong, Coraline?
Don't you wanna play?

505
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:12,753
Yeah! I wanna hug your face!

506
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,021
Get a grip, soldier!

507
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,319
<i>Hey! Hey!</i>

508
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,554
<i>Where's your buttons, Loper?</i>

509
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,687
<i>You want to stay, don't you?</i>

510
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:25,497
Going home tonight,
robots, and I won't be back.

511
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,238
Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

512
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,300
<i>Go to sleep. Go to sleep.</i>

513
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,811
<i>.. a tiny little thing we need to do.</i>

514
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,211
<i>Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.</i>

515
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,044
<i>So sharp you won't feel a thing.</i>

516
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,674
<i>Go to sleep. Go to sleep.</i>

517
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,844
<i>Soon you'll see things our way.</i>

518
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:53,993
Mom! Dad!

519
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,862
Oh, God. I'm still here?

520
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:16,950
Hey, you!

521
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,585
Where's the other
mother? I wanna go home.

522
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,718
All will be swell, soon
as Mother's refreshed.

523
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,024
Her strength is our strength.

524
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,002
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

525
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,198
If you won't even talk to me,
I'm gonna find the other Wybie.

526
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,174
- He'll help me.
- No point.

527
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:43,679
He pulled a long face,
and Mother didn't like it.

528
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,267
And what do you think you're doing?

529
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:15,768
Well, I'm getting out of
here. That's what I'm doing.

530
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,573
Huh?

531
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,015
Something's wrong. Shouldn't
the old well be here?

532
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,076
Nothing out here.

533
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,588
It's the empty part of this world.

534
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,989
She only made what she
knew would impress you.

535
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:32,961
But why? Why does she want me?

536
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,399
She wants something to love, I think.

537
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:38,934
Something that isn't her.

538
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:43,632
Or maybe she'd just
love something to eat.

539
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:47,932
Eat? That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.

540
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:51,039
I don't know. How do you taste?

541
00:55:58,521 --> 00:55:59,510
Huh?

542
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:05,293
But how can you walk away from
something and still come back to it?

543
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,288
Walk around the world.

544
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,594
Small world.

545
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:13,129
Hang on.

546
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,232
Stop! He's one of the circus mice!

547
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,453
I don't like rats at the best of times,

548
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,457
but this one was sounding an alarm.

549
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:39,760
Good kitty.

550
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:21,726
They say even the proudest
spirit can be broken with love.

551
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:30,478
Of course, chocolate
never hurts. Like one?

552
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:35,273
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

553
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:43,623
I want to be with my real mom and dad.

554
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:46,291
I want you to let me go.

555
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,431
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

556
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,060
You aren't my mother.

557
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:57,300
Apologize at once, Coraline!

558
00:57:58,274 --> 00:57:59,298
No!

559
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,407
I'll give you to the count of three.

560
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:06,576
One.

561
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:09,318
Two.

562
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,810
Three!

563
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:13,947
Ow!

564
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,720
What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!

565
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,964
You may come out when you've
learned to be a loving daughter.

566
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:38,513
Who's there?

567
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:44,212
Hush! And shush. For the
beldam might be listening.

568
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,782
You... You mean the other mother?

569
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,602
Who are you?

570
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,704
Don't remember our names,

571
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,903
but I 'member my true mommy.

572
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,437
Why are you all here?

573
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:14,039
The beldam.

574
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:19,953
She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.

575
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:23,583
And saw that we weren't happy.

576
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,355
So she lured us away with treasures.

577
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,399
And treats. And games to play.

578
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,730
Gave all that we asked.

579
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,236
Yet we still wanted more.

580
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:39,135
So we let her sew the buttons.

581
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:44,977
She said that she loved us.

582
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,576
But she locked us here.

583
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,983
And ate up our lives.

584
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:58,050
Well, she can't keep
me in the dark forever.

585
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,295
Not if she wants to win my life.

586
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,598
Beating her is my only chance.

587
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,428
Perhaps, if you do win your escape,

588
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:11,564
you could find our eyes.

589
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:13,938
Has she taken those, too?

590
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,740
Yes, miss. And hidden them.

591
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:20,340
Find our eyes, mistress,
and our souls will be freed.

592
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,082
I'll try.

593
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:34,022
Wybie?

594
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:39,166
Did she do this to you?

595
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:47,375
- I hope that feels...
- Shh!

596
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,716
Coraline? Is that you?

597
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,048
Let's go!

598
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:02,853
Coraline!

599
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,059
Come on! She'll hurt you again.

600
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:16,336
Coraline! How dare you
disobey your mother!

601
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:21,474
Coraline!

602
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:38,554
I'm home!

603
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:43,131
Anybody here?

604
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:47,503
Hello? Hello, hello!

605
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:49,828
Real Dad?

606
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:52,505
Real Mom?

607
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:55,234
Oh, Mom's groceries!

608
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,204
Ugh!

609
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,814
That's disgusting.

610
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,419
I missed you guys so
much, you'll never...

611
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,717
- Oh. The Wybie that talks.
- Huh?

612
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:16,732
Yeah, so, you know that
old doll I gave you?

613
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,159
Um...

614
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,601
My grandma's real mad.
Says it was her sister's.

615
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:25,232
- The one that disappeared.
- You stole that doll, didn't you?

616
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,038
Well, it looked just
like you, and I figured...

617
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:32,241
It used to look like this
pioneer girl, then Huck Finn Jr.,

618
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:36,718
<i>then it was this Little Rascals chick
with all these ribbons and braids and...</i>

619
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:41,155
Grandma's missing sister. I
think I just met her. Come on.

620
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,719
Listen, I'm really not supposed to...

621
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:45,852
Whoa!

622
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:51,957
She's in there.

623
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,569
Can you... Can you unlock it?

624
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,506
Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.

625
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:03,238
She can't escape without her
eyes. None of the ghosts can.

626
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,439
Yeah. So I really need to get that doll.

627
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,185
Great! I'd love to get rid of it.

628
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,384
Where are you hiding,
you little monster?

629
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,621
- You and Grandma been talking?
- The doll's her spy.

630
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:22,095
It's how she watches you, finds
out what's wrong with your life.

631
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:26,101
- The doll is my grandma's spy?
- No. The other mother.

632
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,797
She's got this whole world
where everything's better.

633
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:33,899
The food, the garden, the
neighbors. But it's all a trap.

634
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:39,010
Yeah, I think I heard
someone calling me, Jonesy.

635
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:41,982
Don't believe me? You can ask the cat.

636
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:46,750
The cat? I'll just tell Grandma
that you couldn't find the doll. Ow!

637
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,723
You're not listening to me!

638
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,624
That's 'cause you're crazy!

639
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,565
You creep!
- Crazy!

640
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:03,503
Crazy? You're the jerk
wad that gave me the doll!

641
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:06,272
Mom! Dad!

642
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,507
Pick it up, Dad. Pick it up.

643
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,879
Dad! Where...

644
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:21,981
<i>Hi! I'm digging in my garden right now,</i>

645
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,027
<i>but leave a message and
I'll get right back to you.</i>

646
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:26,959
Where have you gone?

647
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,967
Uh... Don't you only make
wings for the dead ones?

648
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,008
Just looking ahead, dear.

649
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,636
Angus hasn't been
feeling very well of late.

650
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,873
April? Aren't you getting ready?

651
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,108
We've lost our ride, Miriam.

652
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:50,675
Caroline says her parents
have vanished quite completely.

653
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:54,416
What? We've waited
months for those tickets.

654
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,458
I suppose we could walk.

655
01:04:56,525 --> 01:05:01,326
With your gammy legs? It's
nearly two miles to the theater.

656
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:07,764
Oh, yes. Your missing parents.

657
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,131
We know just what you need.

658
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:13,698
Miriam, get... That's right.

659
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,609
How is 100-year-old
candy gonna help?

660
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:34,426
There you go, sweetie.

661
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,558
- What's it for?
- Well, it might help.

662
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:40,932
They're good for bad things sometimes.

663
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,029
No. They're good for lost things.

664
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,267
It's bad things, Miriam.

665
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,776
Lost things, April.
- Bad.

666
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,641
Lost.
- Bad things.

667
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:51,873
- Lost.
- Bad.

668
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:52,937
- Lost.
- Bad.

669
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,039
- Lost.
- Bad.

670
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:55,242
Lost!

671
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:24,504
Good night, Mom.

672
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:27,040
Good night, Dad.

673
01:06:57,279 --> 01:06:59,577
Hello. How did you get in?

674
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:03,585
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

675
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,459
Mom? Dad!

676
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:40,485
How did this happen?

677
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,528
She's taken them.

678
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:36,175
They're not coming back,
are they? Mom and Dad.

679
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:38,940
Not on their own.

680
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,780
Only one thing to do.

681
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:18,216
You know, you're walking
right into her trap.

682
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:20,785
I have to go back.

683
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:23,788
They are my parents.

684
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:30,624
Challenge her, then. She may not
play fair, but she won't refuse.

685
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:33,224
She's got a thing for games.

686
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,131
Hmm.

687
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:36,969
Okay.

688
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,035
Coraline?
- Mom?

689
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,310
Coraline! You came back for us.

690
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:47,542
Mom!

691
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:54,019
Darling, why would you run away from me?

692
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,362
Where are my parents?

693
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:05,457
Gosh, I have no idea
where your old parents are.

694
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,526
Perhaps they've grown bored
of you and run away to France.

695
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,004
They weren't bored
of me. You stole them!

696
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:14,008
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.

697
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,101
Have a seat, won't you?

698
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:30,086
Mmm.

699
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:39,734
- Why don't you have your own key?
- Only one key.

700
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:40,962
Shh!

701
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:44,597
The garden squash need tending,
don't you think, pumpkin?

702
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:49,071
Squish-squash, pumpkin sauce.

703
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:53,843
Mom?

704
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,910
Dad?

705
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,644
Where'd she hide you?

706
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:01,513
Breakfast time!

707
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:09,497
<i>Be strong, Coraline.</i>

708
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:26,875
Why don't we play a game?

709
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:31,208
- I know you like them.
- Everybody likes games.

710
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,020
Uh-huh.

711
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,181
What kind of game would it be?

712
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,590
An exploring game. A
finding things game.

713
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,521
And what is it you'd
be finding, Coraline?

714
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:44,590
My real parents.

715
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,464
Too easy.

716
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,197
And the eyes of the ghost children.

717
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:51,932
Huh.

718
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,506
What if you don't find them?

719
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:58,535
If I lose, I'll stay here with
you forever and let you love me.

720
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,650
And I'll let you sew
buttons into my eyes.

721
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,112
Hmm.

722
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:08,815
And if you somehow win this game?

723
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,485
Then you let me go. You let everyone go.

724
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,152
My real father and mother,

725
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:15,958
the dead children, everyone
you've trapped here.

726
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:18,795
Deal.

727
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:21,728
Not till you give me a clue.

728
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,134
Oh, right.

729
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:28,808
In each of three wonders
I've made just for you,

730
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:32,313
a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.

731
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,778
And for my parents?

732
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:41,419
Fine. Don't tell me.

733
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,226
It's a deal.

734
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,497
What does she mean, "wonders?"

735
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:05,138
Hmm.

736
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:22,360
Ugh!

737
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:37,539
No!

738
01:13:57,966 --> 01:13:59,729
Stop!

739
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:18,782
Why steal this?

740
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:23,050
Wow!

741
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:32,658
That must be it!

742
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:38,803
Sorry.

743
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:44,839
So sorry. Mother making me.

744
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:49,514
Don't wanna hurt you!

745
01:14:57,426 --> 01:14:59,485
Take it!

746
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,368
<i>Bless you, miss. You found me!</i>

747
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,112
<i>But there's two eyes still lost.</i>

748
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,449
Don't worry. I'm getting the hang of it.

749
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:49,127
The pearl.

750
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,132
- Thief!
- Thief!

751
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,199
- Give it back!
- Give it back!

752
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,403
- Thief!
- Thief!

753
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,706
Give it back!

754
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,212
- Thief!
- Thief!

755
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,407
- Thief!
- Thief!

756
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,847
- Give it back!
- Thief!

757
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,475
- Thief!
- Give it back!

758
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,610
- Give it back!
- Thief!

759
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,517
- Give it back!
- Give it back!

760
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:07,748
Thief!

761
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,517
- Thief!
- Thief!

762
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,060
Stop! Stop! Thief! Thief!

763
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:14,686
Thief! Stop!

764
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,866
<i>Hurry on, girl. Her web is unwinding.</i>

765
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:43,985
Oh, Wybie.

766
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:48,728
Evil witch! I'm not scared!

767
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:09,344
<i>Hello, galoobooshka.</i>

768
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:10,976
I'm Coraline.

769
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:16,180
Is this what you're looking for?

770
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:18,957
Uh-huh.

771
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,921
You think winning game is good thing?

772
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:30,700
You'll just go home and
be bored and neglected,

773
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:36,472
same as always. Stay here with us.

774
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:41,609
We will listen to you
and laugh with you.

775
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:55,890
If you stay here, you can
have whatever you want.

776
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:58,824
Always!

777
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,636
You don't get it, do you?

778
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,263
I don't understand.

779
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,874
Of course you don't understand.

780
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,467
You're just a copy she
made of the real Mr. B.

781
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:14,038
Not even that anymore.

782
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,856
No!

783
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:39,432
No!

784
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:47,579
No!

785
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:14,098
Oh, God. I've lost the
game. I've lost everything.

786
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:28,853
I think I mentioned that I don't
like rats at the best of times.

787
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,651
I think you might have
said something like that.

788
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,629
It looked like you
needed this one, however.

789
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:39,364
Thank you.

790
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:48,401
I'm heading inside. I still
have to find my parents.

791
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:15,766
Come on, quickly!

792
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:02,016
So you're back.

793
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,418
And you brought vermin with you.

794
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,781
No. I...

795
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,088
I brought a friend.

796
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:16,026
You know I love you.

797
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:24,029
You have a very funny way of showing it.

798
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:30,077
So where are they? The ghost eyes?

799
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:40,420
Hold on. We aren't finished yet. Are we?

800
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,820
No, I suppose not.

801
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:48,852
After all, you still need to
find your old parents, don't you?

802
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,726
Too bad you won't have this.

803
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:08,710
<i>Be clever, miss. Even if you
win, she'll never let you go!</i>

804
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:19,956
I already know where you've hidden them.

805
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,324
Well, produce them.

806
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,328
They're behind that door.

807
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,270
Oh, they are, are they?

808
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:43,511
There.

809
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,117
Mom. Dad.

810
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:57,621
Go on. Open it. They'll
be there, all right.

811
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:04,497
You're wrong, Coraline.
They aren't there.

812
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:11,705
Now you're going to stay here forever.

813
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,744
No, I'm not!

814
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:29,789
No!

815
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,359
You horrible cheating girl!

816
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:57,791
No! Where are you?

817
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,020
You selfish brat!

818
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,243
You dare disobey your mother?

819
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:27,881
Please shut it!

820
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:47,166
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

821
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,040
I'll die without you!

822
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,642
Coraline, we're home.

823
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:24,940
Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

824
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:30,244
Missed us? Oh, no. You
broke my favorite snow globe.

825
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:33,151
I didn't break it. It must've
broke when you escaped.

826
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,347
And cut your knee.

827
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,050
Coraline, I asked you
to count all the windows,

828
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,786
not put your knee through them.

829
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,328
- But...
- Well, get yourself cleaned up.

830
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:45,355
- We're going out tonight.
- We got a lot to celebrate.

831
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,493
You're talking about
your garden catalog?

832
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,471
Of course. What else?

833
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,133
But look at the snow on your...

834
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:56,609
What's gotten into you, Coraline?

835
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:14,688
- So, gonna order the tulips?
- What's that?

836
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,354
For the garden party?

837
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:18,956
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

838
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:22,901
Dad! So, Ma, invitations?

839
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,906
- Don't forget the invitations.
- Even Bobinsky?

840
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:30,468
Mr. B.'s not drunk,
Mom. He's just eccentric.

841
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:34,144
Good night, Coraline.

842
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:54,966
Oh.

843
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:56,936
Hello again.

844
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,295
You still mad?

845
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:04,343
I'm really sorry I threw
you at her, the other mother.

846
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:07,776
It was all I could think of.

847
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:24,424
I think it's time, don't you?

848
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:26,995
To set them free?

849
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,917
It's a fine, fine thing
you did for us, miss.

850
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,462
Well, I'm glad it's finally over.

851
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,468
It is over and done with for us.

852
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:03,459
What about me?

853
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:05,665
You're in terrible danger, girl!

854
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,334
But how? I locked the door!

855
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:13,073
It's the key, miss. There's only
one, and the beldam will find it.

856
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:16,343
'Tain't all bad, miss.

857
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:21,648
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

858
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:36,262
I gotta hide this somewhere,
somewhere she can never...

859
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:45,568
Out of my way!

860
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:04,331
<i>Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl</i>

861
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,333
<i>I think you are so nice</i>

862
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:11,668
<i>I give you bowls of porridge
and I give you bowls of ice cream</i>

863
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:15,867
<i>I give you lots of kisses</i>

864
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:19,572
<i>And I give you lots of hugs</i>

865
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,778
<i>But I never give you sandwiches</i>

866
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,341
<i>With grease and worms and mung...</i>

867
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:27,781
<i>... beans</i>

868
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:04,514
I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

869
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,145
Why did you change your mind?

870
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:12,124
Well, Grandma showed me this
picture after I called you crazy.

871
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:16,658
It's her and her sister,
before she disappeared.

872
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,596
The Sweet Ghost Girl.

873
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:22,602
Wyborne! Come home!

874
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,372
Oh, man. What am I gonna tell her?

875
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:31,269
Just bring her by the house
tomorrow. We can tell her together.

876
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,379
We... We can?

877
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:37,417
You know, I'm glad you
decided to stalk me.

878
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,013
It wasn't my idea.

879
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,282
Thanks for helping me,
Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

880
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:13,787
Oh, look, April. Pink ladies!

881
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:17,312
Actually, it's just
lemonade. How's Angus doing?

882
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:22,419
Oh, much better, dear, but he
can't duck his wings forever.

883
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:23,520
Here comes a burp.

884
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:25,689
Charlie!

885
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:29,497
<i>Excusez-moi, but that
pizza, that was delicious.</i>

886
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,734
Cold drinks?
- Oh, yeah. Great.

887
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:36,334
You were right, Coraline.
I really hate dirt!

888
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,809
But the tulips look nice.

889
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:41,609
Thanks, Mom.

890
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,252
That is possible.

891
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,017
<i>How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?</i>

892
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:56,427
They tell me that you
are savior, Caroline.

893
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:58,124
And soon as they are ready,

894
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:01,600
they wish to give special
thanks you performance.

895
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:05,730
Wyborne, I know where I'm going.

896
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,603
I grew up here.

897
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:09,438
Welcome, Miss Lovat!

898
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:12,335
Oh. Hello.

899
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:17,610
I'm Coraline Jones. I've
got so much to tell you.

900
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:19,414
Here. Thanks.

901
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,146
Do you want to pop a
little gin in it, dear?

902
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:23,554
Of course.
