00:02:54.60,00:02:56.88
Well? What did you want[br]to show me?

00:02:58.28,00:03:00.00
Kevin, what is this secret?

00:03:01.60,00:03:04.08
What's gotten into you?[br]I'm going back down.

00:03:06.00,00:03:07.48
Kevin, stop it!

00:03:08.40,00:03:11.20
Behave properly![br]You're my cousin!

00:03:12.20,00:03:14.28
What would your father say?

00:03:26.80,00:03:29.20
No, please. Stop it!

00:03:29.20,00:03:31.40
Please, Kevin!

00:03:31.60,00:03:34.48
I beg you. Leave me alone!

00:03:34.68,00:03:37.80
Stop, please! No!

00:07:03.48,00:07:05.28
Come on. Get up.

00:07:06.40,00:07:08.60
Hurry and get dressed.[br]I'll wait for you downstairs.

00:07:23.80,00:07:26.68
- What's going on?[br]- I don't know.

00:07:57.48,00:08:00.08
Dad. Where is Margaret going?

00:08:11.40,00:08:14.48
Mom, where is Father Doyle[br]taking her?

00:08:31.80,00:08:35.60
- Where did you put the brush?[br]- Go away. I won't tell you.

00:08:35.60,00:08:39.28
- Sonia, fart in her face.[br]- I won't fart in her face!

00:08:39.28,00:08:43.28
- Your farts stink more![br]- Forget it.

00:08:44.08,00:08:47.48
- My God, how can you do that?[br]- Where is the brush?

00:08:49.20,00:08:50.68
Take it.

00:08:55.40,00:08:59.20
- It's my turn now.[br]- I did 18. I have to do another 2.

00:08:59.20,00:09:01.08
You did 20. I counted!

00:09:01.28,00:09:04.28
Stop arguing,[br]or I'll brush my hair by myself.

00:09:06.88,00:09:11.80
- Isn't it a sin to be beautiful?[br]- No. Think about the Virgin Mary.

00:09:11.80,00:09:16.48
She is beautiful. You shouldn't[br]be vain. Vanity is a sin.

00:09:22.68,00:09:25.28
- Hey, beautiful, what's your name[br]? - Bernadette.

00:09:25.28,00:09:28.40
- The other one is cute too.[br]- Bernadette is a lovely name.

00:09:28.40,00:09:30.20
It was my grandmother's name[br]and she was proud of it.

00:09:30.20,00:09:33.20
- Will you come give us a kiss?[br]- Forget it!

00:09:33.20,00:09:35.40
Let's see your legs. Come on!

00:09:35.40,00:09:38.60
- What?[br]- Let us see your legs.

00:09:38.60,00:09:40.60
Let's see those legs!

00:09:40.60,00:09:44.80
- You always spy on girls?[br]- Which one of us do you like?

00:09:45.80,00:09:49.88
- Do you like me?[br]- With that face? Look at me!

00:09:49.88,00:09:53.08
Scoundrels. If you don't go away[br]right now, I'll call the police!

00:10:00.80,00:10:02.68
She left!

00:10:02.88,00:10:05.00
She's a witch, huh?

00:10:05.00,00:10:08.00
- Come on up and give us a kiss.[br]- How brazen!

00:10:08.00,00:10:10.60
- Why not?[br]- I'm not one of those.

00:10:10.60,00:10:13.20
You didn't say that the other[br]night.

00:10:14.68,00:10:18.40
- Will you give him a kiss?[br]- She's provoking us!

00:10:18.40,00:10:21.08
I know. She's looking for[br]a fiancee.

00:11:08.68,00:11:13.00
He's lovely, isn't he?[br]And this bonnet!

00:11:15.00,00:11:18.80
Mom, at least look at him,[br]please.

00:11:20.60,00:11:22.68
He is your grandson.

00:11:24.28,00:11:27.20
I told you how sorry I am

00:11:27.20,00:11:32.00
to have done something so[br]shameful. Please, look at him!

00:11:32.00,00:11:35.28
You can't blame him.[br]He has nothing to do with it.

00:11:36.28,00:11:39.08
I know I dishonored you and Dad.

00:11:39.48,00:11:41.40
Look at him, Mom.

00:11:42.40,00:11:45.28
Mom, please.[br]Say something, anything!

00:11:49.00,00:11:50.40
Hello, Dad.

00:12:11.80,00:12:13.68
Sit down, Rose.

00:12:16.60,00:12:21.20
I am father Doonigan. I work for[br]the St. John Adoption Society.

00:12:21.20,00:12:25.08
Your father and I think the best[br]thing for the child

00:12:25.08,00:12:26.68
is to give him up for adoption.

00:12:26.68,00:12:29.68
A child born outside of wedlock[br]is a bastard.

00:12:29.68,00:12:32.28
You want him to live all his life[br]as an outcast,

00:12:32.28,00:12:35.28
refused and scorned by all honest[br]members of society?

00:12:35.40,00:12:39.88
- You committed a horrible sin.[br]- I know, Father. I am repentant.

00:12:39.88,00:12:43.80
Do you want your child to pay[br]for your sins?

00:12:44.48,00:12:47.88
- No, Father.[br]- Speak more loudly, Rose.

00:12:48.28,00:12:49.40
No, Father.

00:12:49.40,00:12:52.00
So you do want to give him[br]a chance in life,

00:12:52.00,00:12:55.68
and have him raised in a Catholic[br]family with a mother and father.

00:12:58.80,00:13:01.08
Sign here.

00:13:15.88,00:13:17.20
So,

00:13:18.08,00:13:20.68
stay here while I get the baby.

00:13:20.68,00:13:24.68
- You're taking him away now?[br]- You might become attached to him.

00:13:37.48,00:13:40.00
Did you see the baby, Dad?

00:13:42.28,00:13:44.00
He's lovely.

00:13:47.80,00:13:53.48
I'm going to tell him I changed my[br]mind! Can the form be ripped up?

00:13:55.00,00:13:58.48
Mom, did you see him?[br]Isn't he lovely?

00:14:01.88,00:14:03.68
Yes, he is.

00:14:06.00,00:14:09.60
My baby! I want my baby![br]I've changed my mind!

00:14:09.60,00:14:15.60
Please, Dad, stop them![br]Don't let them take my baby away!

00:14:23.80,00:14:25.28
Please!

00:14:28.20,00:14:30.08
Please, Dad!

00:15:39.88,00:15:42.60
Put them here on the floor and[br]wait.

00:15:50.08,00:15:53.08
Sister Bridget can receive you.[br]Come in.

00:16:12.00,00:16:15.60
The philosophy that supports us[br]in the Magdalene Asylums is simple:

00:16:15.60,00:16:18.68
Thanks to the power of prayer,[br]of cleanliness, of hard work,

00:16:18.68,00:16:23.28
Iost women can find the road[br]towards Jesus Christ.

00:16:24.08,00:16:26.88
Mary Magdalene, holy patron[br]of the Magdalene Asylums,

00:16:26.88,00:16:29.20
was a sinner of the worst kind.

00:16:29.20,00:16:33.20
For money, she gave her body[br]to the depraved and lustful.

00:16:34.00,00:16:37.40
She was saved by doing pennance[br]for her sins,

00:16:37.40,00:16:42.00
giving up the pleasures of[br]the flesh, including food and sleep.

00:16:42.00,00:16:44.48
She worked beyond the resistance[br]of a human being

00:16:44.48,00:16:46.40
so that she could offer[br]her soul to God,

00:16:46.40,00:16:50.68
cross the gates of Paradise,[br]and live an eternal life.

00:16:53.20,00:16:56.88
Our laundries do not just clean[br]ordinary clothes and sheets.

00:16:56.88,00:17:00.00
They are the earthly means[br]that serve to cleanse your souls

00:17:00.00,00:17:03.40
and cancel the spots of sin[br]that you committed.

00:17:04.80,00:17:07.20
Here you can be redeemed[br]in pleasing God.

00:17:07.20,00:17:10.08
You can be saved[br]from eternal damnation.

00:17:10.48,00:17:15.20
Breakfast is at 6. At 6,30 there[br]is prayer. Work begins at 7.

00:17:15.20,00:17:17.60
- Lunch...[br]- Excuse me, Sister.

00:17:18.48,00:17:20.60
I think I should leave.

00:17:21.80,00:17:23.88
My father was very...

00:17:23.88,00:17:29.48
Don't ever interrupt, girl. Didn't[br]they tell you it is bad manners,

00:17:29.48,00:17:33.00
or you were too busy being a slut[br]to listen?

00:17:33.00,00:17:36.48
- No, Sister.[br]- Then you are ignorant.

00:17:37.20,00:17:40.80
Are you such a simpleton?[br]I decide if you can leave.

00:17:40.80,00:17:44.68
I think I can safely say[br]it will take some time.

00:17:44.68,00:17:47.40
- What is your name?[br]- Margaret, Sister.

00:17:47.40,00:17:50.08
- Margaret what?[br]- Maguire.

00:17:53.40,00:17:55.60
- And you?[br]- Rose Dunne.

00:17:55.60,00:17:57.88
We already have a Rose.[br]What is your second name?

00:17:57.88,00:17:59.28
I don't have one.

00:17:59.28,00:18:03.40
Not on your birth certificate, but[br]your parents had some names in mind.

00:18:03.40,00:18:06.48
- What is your Confirmation name?[br]- Patricia.

00:18:06.48,00:18:08.68
You will be called Patricia.

00:18:11.08,00:18:14.48
- Thank you, Sister[br]- Thank you, Sister.

00:18:15.68,00:18:19.20
- And you?[br]- Bernadette Haffie.

00:18:19.48,00:18:21.60
From Saint Attractas.

00:18:22.28,00:18:23.60
Yes, Sister.

00:18:23.60,00:18:27.00
- How do you think I know?[br]- I don't know.

00:18:27.00,00:18:31.20
Because principal McLaughlin is my[br]good friend and told me about you,

00:18:31.20,00:18:35.88
or after many years in this[br]convent, I can spot a tempter?

00:18:35.88,00:18:38.00
I don't know, Sister.

00:18:38.88,00:18:41.88
Poor us![br]Two simpletons in just one day!

00:18:41.88,00:18:45.68
Anyway, time will tell us, right?

00:18:45.68,00:18:48.20
Now come with me.

00:18:54.88,00:18:57.08
- Good evening, Sister.[br]- Good evening.

00:19:05.80,00:19:07.48
You, come with me.

00:19:09.80,00:19:11.68
You, go over there.

00:19:14.48,00:19:16.28
You, come here.

00:19:55.88,00:19:59.68
In the name of the Father,[br]the Son and the Holy Spirit.

00:20:00.48,00:20:04.80
"Angel of God, my guardian dear,[br]to whom God's love brought me here,

00:20:04.80,00:20:09.60
ever this day be at my side,[br]to light, to rule and guide."

00:20:10.28,00:20:14.00
In the name of the Father,[br]the Son and the Holy Spirit.

00:20:14.00,00:20:15.60
Get right to bed, girls.

00:21:01.60,00:21:06.00
Excuse me. Can you take me[br]to the bathroom, please?

00:21:06.00,00:21:07.28
Yes.

00:21:15.08,00:21:16.20
Are you alright?

00:21:32.28,00:21:33.80
Here.

00:21:37.40,00:21:39.00
I feel awful.

00:21:41.20,00:21:43.28
- What's the matter?[br]- I feel...

00:21:46.20,00:21:48.88
I feel faint.

00:21:56.40,00:21:59.48
Don't touch her.[br]Is your milk clogged?

00:22:00.68,00:22:02.40
I don't know. I think so.

00:22:02.40,00:22:04.48
Don't touch her.[br]You'll drip everywhere.

00:22:04.48,00:22:07.68
The sisters get furious[br]when you drip.

00:22:08.28,00:22:12.60
Keep the pain.[br]It'll go away in a few days.

00:22:13.40,00:22:15.08
You should go to bed.

00:22:17.80,00:22:20.88
If they see you become friends,[br]they'll skin you alive.

00:22:58.40,00:23:02.20
Everyone get out of bed![br]Everyone up!

00:23:07.80,00:23:10.80
Have any of you seen Una O'Conner[br]?

00:23:16.00,00:23:19.08
Did any of you hear anything[br]during the night?

00:23:23.28,00:23:26.20
None of you saw her leave?

00:23:32.40,00:23:33.68
Breakfast!

00:24:28.40,00:24:29.88
"I believe in one God,

00:24:30.88,00:24:33.80
Father Almighty,[br]Creator of Heaven and Earth,

00:24:34.60,00:24:37.60
and of all things visible,[br]and invisible.

00:24:39.00,00:24:43.80
I believe in Jesus Christ,[br]His only Son,

00:24:43.80,00:24:46.80
born of the Father[br]before all ages.

00:24:46.80,00:24:49.28
God of God, Light of Light,

00:24:49.60,00:24:53.48
true God of true God,[br]begotten, and not made."

00:24:54.20,00:24:57.40
I'm sure she was there last night.[br]I checked.

00:24:57.40,00:25:02.00
I checked too![br]Don't think I slept last night!

00:25:03.60,00:25:07.28
I don't know how it happened.[br]I can't explain it.

00:25:07.28,00:25:09.28
You were obviously distracted.

00:25:10.48,00:25:13.28
Anyway, it is your fault.

00:25:13.60,00:25:15.28
- It's the first time...[br]- I didn't...

00:25:16.80,00:25:18.48
Enough!

00:25:32.00,00:25:36.68
"I believe in one Holy, Catholic[br]and Apostolic Church."

00:25:48.48,00:25:52.48
I keep them all[br]well under control, Sister.

00:25:52.48,00:25:55.40
Did you know I've been working[br]here for 40 years?

00:26:06.68,00:26:12.08
I won't wash priests' collars.[br]Ask someone else. I don't do that.

00:26:12.08,00:26:14.68
So I have to do my work[br]and yours too?

00:26:14.68,00:26:18.00
- If you want, we can exchange.[br]- Forget it.

00:26:18.00,00:26:20.60
Do you have something bloody?

00:26:20.60,00:26:24.80
Some girls hate bloody things.[br]I don't really care.

00:26:24.88,00:26:27.48
There. I'll do that for you.

00:26:28.60,00:26:33.00
Some put them in hot water.[br]I told them, but they won't listen.

00:26:33.00,00:26:37.60
First you must put them in cold[br]water with a little salt.

00:26:38.40,00:26:40.28
After that, rub them.

00:26:45.20,00:26:46.20
I see.

00:26:47.20,00:26:51.20
What are you talking about?[br]It's forbidden to talk here!

00:26:51.20,00:26:54.00
Sister, they were talking.[br]I'm giving them a good scolding!

00:26:54.00,00:26:56.68
- Am I right, Sister?[br]- Yes, Katy.

00:26:56.80,00:27:00.00
It is not allowed to talk here.

00:27:01.00,00:27:04.80
- What were you talking about?[br]- I told her how to wash this.

00:27:04.80,00:27:07.80
Jesus, Joseph and Mary![br]Get that away from me.

00:27:07.80,00:27:11.60
You are disgusting.[br]Did you know that?

00:27:11.60,00:27:13.48
Get back to work.

00:27:15.20,00:27:18.60
I've been working here for 40[br]years. I know all the tricks.

00:27:18.60,00:27:20.40
I'm keeping you two under control[br]!

00:27:28.08,00:27:34.00
Poor Sister Augusta is in trouble[br]because that girl ran away.

00:27:34.00,00:27:36.68
That's why they told me[br]to substitute her here.

00:27:36.68,00:27:40.00
That poor sister is destroyed.[br]Her nerves are shattered.

00:27:40.00,00:27:43.60
Am I right in giving them[br]a piece of mind, Sister?

00:27:43.60,00:27:45.28
A good scolding!

00:27:45.28,00:27:49.08
The bad thing about you,[br]is that you are all selfish!

00:27:49.08,00:27:53.68
You don't care if a sister gets[br]into trouble and loses her position.

00:27:53.68,00:27:57.60
She just fell asleep[br]while she was on surveillance,

00:27:57.60,00:28:00.20
and now she'll end up in Africa.

00:28:01.60,00:28:04.40
She'll go work with the lepers.

00:28:04.88,00:28:08.40
Her fingers will fall[br]from her hands and her feet.

00:28:08.40,00:28:10.68
She could lose her nose!

00:28:11.40,00:28:14.48
Anything that sticks out[br]from her body could fall off.

00:28:15.60,00:28:17.48
Now get to work.

00:28:19.00,00:28:22.20
Work in silence. Come on!

00:28:28.08,00:28:30.80
- We have to get out of here.[br]- Silence!

00:29:26.00,00:29:27.88
- No![br]- Walk!

00:29:28.80,00:29:30.88
I'll make you walk! Walk!

00:29:31.28,00:29:33.40
Please, don't!

00:29:33.88,00:29:35.80
I'm sorry!

00:29:35.80,00:29:38.80
Please! Leave me!

00:29:39.40,00:29:41.28
- Is this your place?[br]- Please, Father!

00:29:41.28,00:29:43.20
- Please![br]- Is this your place?

00:29:43.20,00:29:46.48
You'll stay here[br]until you live, slut!

00:29:46.48,00:29:49.88
I just wanted to go home,[br]Dad... Go back to my house!

00:29:51.00,00:29:53.00
I hate this place!

00:29:53.00,00:29:56.48
I thought I told you...[br]What did I tell you?

00:29:59.60,00:30:01.60
What did I tell you?

00:30:04.68,00:30:08.60
You don't have a home,[br]a mother or a father.

00:30:09.20,00:30:12.88
You killed us, slut.[br]You killed both of us.

00:30:13.68,00:30:17.68
If you run away again,[br]I swear I'll make you a cripple.

00:30:21.80,00:30:26.20
Mr. O'Conner,[br]I think you should leave.

00:30:26.60,00:30:29.08
We'll take care of Una.

00:30:29.08,00:30:31.28
What are you looking at, sluts?

00:30:40.28,00:30:42.48
God bless you, Sister.

00:30:43.40,00:30:48.28
Please don't leave me here, Dad![br]Don't leave me here!

00:30:50.88,00:30:52.80
Get to bed, Una.

00:30:53.68,00:30:55.68
I'll see you tomorrow morning.

00:30:56.40,00:30:57.68
And now,

00:30:59.08,00:31:01.08
everyone under the covers.

00:31:02.68,00:31:04.48
You must sleep.

00:32:54.80,00:32:57.40
Are all the women[br]who work here, sluts?

00:32:57.40,00:33:00.88
Don't look at them[br]or talk to them, understand?

00:33:07.80,00:33:08.68
Good morning.

00:33:40.08,00:33:42.28
Someone wants you.

00:33:48.80,00:33:50.20
My sister!

00:33:53.28,00:33:54.88
My little one!

00:33:55.68,00:33:57.20
My little boy!

00:33:58.60,00:34:03.08
He's so lovely! Isn't he[br]the loveliest child on this earth?

00:34:04.20,00:34:06.48
He's only 2 years old[br]and look how big he is!

00:34:15.20,00:34:20.60
Blessed Virgin,[br]I pray to you and St. Christopher.

00:34:21.40,00:34:24.40
St. Christopher, take care...

00:34:28.00,00:34:29.88
God in Heaven, protect him.

00:34:30.68,00:34:32.68
Blessed are You and blessed are[br]all.

00:34:37.88,00:34:41.20
You two, stop wasting time!

00:35:07.68,00:35:09.60
Are you spastic?

00:35:09.60,00:35:11.68
No. I was just making[br]a pleasant expression.

00:35:11.68,00:35:14.68
You can stick it up your ass.

00:35:15.00,00:35:16.08
Wow.

00:35:17.48,00:35:19.68
They told me you liked boys.

00:35:20.80,00:35:22.08
Isn't that so?

00:35:22.68,00:35:25.60
Aren't you here because you like[br]giving it to young men?

00:35:26.08,00:35:28.08
You like pulling[br]your panties down, right?

00:35:36.60,00:35:38.68
What is your little boy's name?

00:35:41.80,00:35:42.88
I don't know.

00:35:50.60,00:35:52.60
Ask me what my name is.

00:35:56.00,00:35:57.60
What is your name?

00:36:06.60,00:36:07.80
Crispina.

00:36:12.00,00:36:14.28
It means "girl with curly hair".

00:36:22.40,00:36:24.48
That's what Sister Bridget[br]called me.

00:36:45.08,00:36:47.00
Two shillings[br]if you suck my cock.

00:36:52.20,00:36:54.08
You are crazy, ugly slut!

00:37:01.48,00:37:05.40
When my baby came out of my[br]stomach, they gave him to my sister.

00:37:05.80,00:37:09.60
She doesn't have permission[br]to come here, or talk to me.

00:37:10.60,00:37:12.88
That's why I don't know his name.

00:37:15.40,00:37:18.68
But my aunt, who is the richest[br]woman in the world,

00:37:19.28,00:37:21.48
gave me and him one of these.

00:37:21.68,00:37:23.60
My sister...

00:37:23.60,00:37:27.60
My sister brings him to the gate[br]every once in a while,

00:37:27.68,00:37:30.20
and we talk with this.

00:37:30.88,00:37:32.28
This is...

00:37:33.00,00:37:34.08
It's...

00:37:37.88,00:37:39.68
It's Saint...

00:37:42.00,00:37:43.28
A saint...

00:37:44.00,00:37:46.28
Excuse me, Sister.[br]What is the word?

00:37:46.28,00:37:47.60
What is the word?

00:37:47.88,00:37:49.80
I can't find the word.

00:37:49.80,00:37:52.60
You know you're not supposed[br]to talk. Get back to work.

00:37:53.60,00:37:56.00
I said get back to work.

00:37:56.80,00:37:58.80
I don't want to repeat it.

00:37:58.88,00:38:03.28
Telephone! That's it, telephone.[br]I never remember the word.

00:38:03.28,00:38:05.88
I want to see Sister Bridget[br]immediately!

00:38:13.88,00:38:15.48
Wait here.

00:38:37.20,00:38:39.68
I heard you were disobedient.

00:38:39.68,00:38:43.28
- I'm sorry, Sister.[br]- I just asked to see you.

00:38:43.28,00:38:46.40
You didn't ask, girl.[br]You demanded.

00:38:47.00,00:38:49.80
Who gave you the right[br]to demand something?

00:38:49.80,00:38:53.00
I was wondering[br]why I am here, Sister.

00:38:53.00,00:38:55.20
I did not commit any crime.

00:38:55.20,00:38:59.60
I've never been to bed with a boy,[br]and that's the truth.

00:38:59.60,00:39:01.68
But you'd like it, wouldn't you?

00:39:02.48,00:39:04.20
I am a good girl.

00:39:04.20,00:39:07.40
No. You are arrogant,[br]impolite and stupid.

00:39:07.40,00:39:09.48
That's why the boys liked you.

00:39:09.48,00:39:14.00
Scarce intelligence makes it easy[br]to slip fingers under your clothes.

00:39:14.60,00:39:16.08
Right, Crispina?

00:39:17.00,00:39:18.40
Yes, Sister.

00:39:20.00,00:39:21.80
What did I say?

00:39:22.48,00:39:24.60
I don't know, Sister.

00:39:24.60,00:39:26.00
That all men are sinners[br]and therefore, prone to temptation.

00:39:26.00,00:39:28.28
and therefore, all men[br]are prone to temptation.

00:39:28.28,00:39:32.08
In God fearing countries, if men[br]want to be saved from themselves,

00:39:32.08,00:39:34.00
temptation must be removed.

00:39:34.68,00:39:37.68
- Understand, girl?[br]- Yes, Sister.

00:39:37.88,00:39:39.68
I didn't ask you.

00:39:41.00,00:39:42.40
I understand, Sister.

00:39:42.40,00:39:44.08
Are you really sure?

00:39:45.60,00:39:48.68
You used too many words.[br]One syllable was enough.

00:39:49.80,00:39:51.40
I understand, Sister.

00:39:53.08,00:39:56.00
Disobedience cannot be tolerated.

00:40:00.40,00:40:02.08
Faces to the wall.

00:40:14.80,00:40:17.68
Now go back to your work[br]immediately.

00:40:23.48,00:40:26.48
Una, have you become mad?

00:40:26.88,00:40:29.08
You don't need that hair anymore.

00:40:29.08,00:40:33.48
We'll sell it to O'Brien and give[br]the money to African children.

00:40:34.40,00:40:36.00
Alright?

00:40:39.48,00:40:43.88
You won't run away[br]with a shaved head, will you?

00:41:33.20,00:41:34.80
Where could you go?

00:41:35.60,00:41:38.48
I have a cousin in Dublin[br]who is a hairdresser.

00:41:39.80,00:41:41.48
I just saw her once,

00:41:41.48,00:41:44.48
but I'm sure if I ask her,[br]she will help me.

00:41:46.40,00:41:48.28
Do you want to come with me?

00:41:50.08,00:41:54.80
Why? What wrong did we do[br]to deserve this?

00:41:56.28,00:41:58.08
We are not slaves.

00:41:58.80,00:42:00.68
We are not handicapped.

00:42:01.00,00:42:02.68
What did we do?

00:42:04.08,00:42:06.08
Having a child is not a crime.

00:42:07.20,00:42:10.48
Having a child before marriage[br]is a mortal sin.

00:42:11.00,00:42:15.40
All mortal sins of the world[br]do not justify this place.

00:42:15.40,00:42:19.88
I'd commit any sin[br]to get out of this place.

00:42:28.20,00:42:30.60
- Let's get married.[br]- What?

00:42:31.28,00:42:34.28
- We can run away together.[br]- Where will we go?

00:42:35.00,00:42:36.68
To England, America,[br]wherever you want.

00:42:36.68,00:42:39.60
- Do you have any money?[br]- You think I have money?

00:42:39.60,00:42:42.00
Didn't you save anything[br]from your pay?

00:42:42.00,00:42:45.48
You think I came here[br]in answer to an ad in the paper?

00:42:45.48,00:42:48.40
- I thought you had something.[br]- They don't give us anything.

00:42:48.40,00:42:49.68
Well?

00:42:50.48,00:42:53.28
- Well what?[br]- Let's run away.

00:42:53.28,00:42:57.20
How? We don't have money,[br]or a place to go.

00:42:57.20,00:43:00.48
Besides,[br]I practically don't know you.

00:43:16.08,00:43:20.28
You can look, but if you touch[br]me, I'll kick your teeth in.

00:43:37.40,00:43:38.88
It's not a fireplace.

00:43:42.48,00:43:46.60
- Do you have the back door keys?[br]- I don't. Seamus does.

00:43:46.60,00:43:48.60
- Can you get them?[br]- I think so.

00:43:49.60,00:43:52.08
Then get them[br]and bring them tonight.

00:43:53.20,00:43:55.20
- Tonight?[br]- Yes.

00:43:55.28,00:43:57.48
Holy God! Oh Holy God!

00:43:58.60,00:44:00.00
- Christ![br]- God in Heaven!

00:44:00.00,00:44:03.20
- Promise you will come tonight.[br]- Okay, I promise.

00:44:03.20,00:44:06.20
- If you don't, they'll kill me.[br]- I promise.

00:44:16.20,00:44:18.48
Go away![br]I don't want to see you!

00:44:19.68,00:44:22.40
You are disgusting![br]Really disgusting!

00:44:22.40,00:44:25.88
- We're getting married. I swear![br]- He'll never marry you.

00:44:25.88,00:44:30.08
He will, but if you tell them,[br]I won't be able to leave,

00:44:30.08,00:44:31.80
and we can't get married.

00:44:31.80,00:44:34.40
I will be a sinner.[br]You don't want that, do you?

00:44:34.40,00:44:39.00
No. I'll tell Sister Bridget[br]you acted disgustingly.

00:44:39.28,00:44:43.88
They'll keep you here forever,[br]and you can go to Heaven,

00:44:43.88,00:44:47.20
because you will have paid[br]for your disgusting sins.

00:44:47.20,00:44:50.28
- Please, don't tell her.[br]- Isn't that good?

00:44:50.28,00:44:54.20
I'll stay here and work[br]and pray for my sins.

00:44:54.20,00:44:56.40
Please, don't tell her.

00:44:56.40,00:44:58.68
I have to tell her.

00:45:01.80,00:45:05.88
Alright, but if you do,[br]I will kill myself.

00:45:06.20,00:45:08.08
Do you know what that means?

00:45:08.40,00:45:11.48
It means I will go to Hell[br]and so will you,

00:45:12.00,00:45:15.68
because in the eyes of God you[br]will be guilty of murder as much as me.

00:45:16.48,00:45:19.28
No, that's not so.

00:45:20.20,00:45:21.68
It's not true.

00:46:56.68,00:46:59.80
It's crazy. A bunch of bullshit.

00:47:01.40,00:47:04.08
Open the door. Open the door.

00:47:17.28,00:47:20.60
Brendan! It's me.[br]Please, open the door.

00:47:23.08,00:47:27.08
It's madness. I don't even know[br]your name! It's crazy!

00:47:27.08,00:47:30.60
My name is Bernadette![br]Please, open the door!

00:47:30.60,00:47:33.28
They will know I did it.[br]Do you realize that?

00:47:33.28,00:47:36.08
I'll lose my job, everything!

00:47:36.08,00:47:39.40
My brother's serving 6 years in[br]jail for stealing apples from the nuns.

00:47:39.40,00:47:44.08
What would my sentence be?[br]I'm sorry, I can't.

00:47:44.08,00:47:46.60
Brendan! Don't leave me here!

00:47:47.28,00:47:48.88
- Brendan![br]- I'm sorry.

00:47:49.20,00:47:52.08
At least open this damned door!

00:48:17.80,00:48:19.40
- Stop![br]- Hold her!

00:48:21.40,00:48:22.80
I'm holding her!

00:48:25.40,00:48:26.80
Stop it!

00:48:29.08,00:48:30.48
I'm holding her!

00:48:35.68,00:48:38.68
- That's enough.[br]- Stop!

00:49:02.40,00:49:04.60
Open your eyes, girl.

00:49:05.60,00:49:06.48
Open them.

00:49:10.28,00:49:13.80
I want you to see[br]what you really are.

00:49:14.20,00:49:17.88
Now that vanity has gone and your[br]arrogance has been defeated,

00:49:17.88,00:49:21.60
you are free to choose between[br]right and wrong, good and evil.

00:49:21.60,00:49:25.28
Look into the bottom of your soul[br]and find what is pure

00:49:25.28,00:49:27.08
and offer it to the Lord.

00:49:27.80,00:49:30.60
That is the only way to salvation.

00:51:38.80,00:51:40.48
Alright, enough.

00:51:41.68,00:51:44.48
There's nothing like exercise[br]before dinner.

00:51:44.48,00:51:48.28
Anyway, someone should eat[br]less potatoes.

00:51:49.40,00:51:51.08
Hands along your sides.

00:51:53.20,00:51:58.00
Frances, not only are your breasts[br]the smallest I've ever seen,

00:51:58.00,00:52:00.00
but you don't even have nipples!

00:52:00.00,00:52:03.48
Did you notice?[br]That can't be normal, right?

00:52:06.68,00:52:10.20
We agree. Frances has[br]the smallest breasts.

00:52:10.20,00:52:11.68
Who has the biggest?

00:52:15.48,00:52:19.08
- I'd say Patricia.[br]- No. She has a big behind.

00:52:19.08,00:52:20.88
Turn around, Patricia.

00:52:24.00,00:52:28.60
See? Patricia,[br]you have a bricklayer's back.

00:52:30.00,00:52:33.20
With a couple of tattoos,[br]you'd look like a sailor.

00:52:34.20,00:52:40.20
No, Cecilia is surely the winner[br]for the biggest breasts.

00:52:40.28,00:52:42.28
An applause for Cecilia.

00:52:44.20,00:52:45.80
Good girl.

00:52:45.80,00:52:49.40
We saw the biggest breasts,[br]the smallest,

00:52:49.40,00:52:50.88
and the biggest behind.

00:52:50.88,00:52:53.48
There is only the hairiest one[br]left.

00:52:56.80,00:52:59.40
Crispina, one step forward.

00:53:00.48,00:53:02.48
Bernadette, one step forward.

00:53:03.60,00:53:05.48
Get alongside of each other.

00:53:07.28,00:53:10.48
Crispina, take your hands away[br]from there!

00:53:12.88,00:53:16.28
Bernadette, you have more hair[br]there than on your head.

00:53:17.40,00:53:20.68
But the winner is... Crispina.

00:53:23.28,00:53:26.88
Crispina, you won![br]Why are you crying?

00:53:26.88,00:53:28.80
I don't know, Sister.

00:53:29.00,00:53:31.48
Neither do I.[br]We were playing.

00:53:39.88,00:53:43.68
Everyone put your clothes back on[br]! It's time for tea.

00:54:50.48,00:54:53.80
"Every day of my life[br]belongs to You, my Lord.

00:54:53.88,00:54:56.60
Every act of my life[br]should be taken

00:54:56.80,00:54:59.20
with the pure intention[br]of honoring only You.

00:54:59.60,00:55:02.00
From this moment on,[br]I offer them to Your sacred heart,

00:55:02.00,00:55:06.20
and with this offering, I[br]consecrate them to Your glory.

00:55:07.20,00:55:11.08
And I will undertake them,[br]aiming at perfection.

00:55:11.20,00:55:13.20
Do not allow, my Savior,

00:55:13.20,00:55:17.08
that they be soiled by anything[br]unworthy of your sacred heart."

00:55:18.08,00:55:19.88
What is going on down there?

00:55:22.00,00:55:26.08
- Crispina, what are you doing?[br]- I don't know, Sister.

00:55:26.08,00:55:29.40
- She's very hot, Sister.[br]- Take her to bed.

00:55:30.28,00:55:31.40
Let's go.

00:55:32.28,00:55:34.28
I'm sorry, Sister.

00:55:35.88,00:55:39.40
I think I made a mess.[br]I'm sorry.

00:55:43.28,00:55:47.08
"I give up everything that[br]diminishes the value of my offering.

00:55:47.08,00:55:50.80
I give up vanity, self love,[br]human respect.

00:55:50.80,00:55:54.68
Grant to me, oh Lord, the chance[br]to begin, to go on, to finish

00:55:54.68,00:55:56.60
this day in Your grace,

00:55:56.60,00:56:00.88
with the sole intent[br]of pleasing and honoring You. Amen."

00:56:07.40,00:56:09.00
I am dying.

00:56:09.00,00:56:12.08
You're not dying. You have fever.[br]It's probably the flu.

00:56:12.20,00:56:15.88
- You can die from the flu.[br]- Old people die, not the young.

00:56:18.08,00:56:20.00
Did you sleep here all night?

00:56:21.60,00:56:23.00
Did you pee in bed?

00:56:23.00,00:56:25.20
I never did,[br]even when I was little.

00:56:25.20,00:56:27.88
Then why is it so wet?

00:56:31.00,00:56:33.20
Thank God it didn't go through[br]the other side.

00:56:33.20,00:56:36.88
Otherwise, we would've had to tell[br]the nuns. You don't want that, huh?

00:56:39.00,00:56:39.88
Hold this.

00:56:47.20,00:56:49.08
Sleep with your clothes on.

00:56:50.80,00:56:52.68
I'll look for some sheets.

00:56:55.40,00:56:58.00
- I can do it myself.[br]- Then do it.

00:57:01.40,00:57:02.88
I'll be right back.

00:57:07.88,00:57:12.00
- What is going on now?[br]- I lost my medal.

00:57:12.00,00:57:14.00
My St. Christopher.

00:57:14.00,00:57:16.40
Relax. Let's see[br]if it's on the floor.

00:57:17.00,00:57:19.48
Where is my St. Christopher?

00:57:19.48,00:57:21.68
- I don't know.[br]- Where is it?

00:57:21.68,00:57:25.48
Crispina, don't worry.[br]Relax and lie down.

00:57:26.20,00:57:29.20
It probably fell in the cafeteria.[br]I'll go get it.

00:57:29.40,00:57:31.28
Get under the covers[br]like a good girl.

00:57:35.00,00:57:37.48
- What'll I do?[br]- I'll find it.

00:57:37.80,00:57:41.20
St. Christopher... What will I do?

00:58:37.90,00:58:39.50
She's not well!

00:58:43.70,00:58:45.42
She's not...

00:58:48.22,00:58:49.30
What?

00:59:17.50,00:59:18.90
Crispina?

00:59:22.70,00:59:24.62
Crispina, what are you doing?

00:59:26.30,00:59:29.70
- You'll never find St.[br]Christopher. - I will!

00:59:29.70,00:59:31.82
Get down from there and go to bed.

00:59:32.42,00:59:35.30
- This is my punishment.[br]- For what?

00:59:38.22,00:59:40.22
I promise I will find it.

00:59:41.82,00:59:44.42
Come down.[br]Come on.

00:59:49.62,00:59:50.82
Lie down.

00:59:54.82,00:59:58.22
If someone dies from the flu,[br]it is not his fault.

00:59:58.70,01:00:03.22
Of course it isn't.[br]In any case, you won't die.

01:00:03.22,01:00:05.02
What if I do?

01:00:11.10,01:00:13.62
- Will you be a good girl now?[br]- Yes.

01:00:13.90,01:00:15.82
I must get back to work.

01:01:44.30,01:01:45.82
Wake up!

01:01:48.02,01:01:49.50
Wake up!

01:01:54.70,01:01:56.70
We have to try to lift her!

01:01:58.70,01:02:01.50
Get her legs and lift her!

01:02:02.90,01:02:05.10
- Crispina, breathe![br]- Come on!

01:02:05.42,01:02:05.82
Try to breathe!

01:02:05.82,01:02:07.42
Try to breathe!

01:02:08.30,01:02:10.42
- She can't![br]- Hurry!

01:02:10.90,01:02:13.22
Crispina, don't move around.

01:02:13.22,01:02:14.10
Loosen it!

01:02:14.82,01:02:17.70
- I can't. It's too tight.[br]- You have to loosen it!

01:02:18.82,01:02:21.42
- Lift her more![br]- Yes, lift her up!

01:02:23.42,01:02:25.10
That's it. Don't move her.

01:02:26.70,01:02:28.70
She's almost made it!

01:02:37.62,01:02:40.62
Crispina, why did you want[br]to kill yourself?

01:02:40.62,01:02:43.50
What a stupid question[br]to ask in this place.

01:02:44.82,01:02:46.22
Why?

01:02:46.62,01:02:50.30
I wanted to die from the flu,[br]but you said I wouldn't die.

01:02:50.30,01:02:53.70
You must not kill yourself.[br]It's the biggest of mortal sins.

01:02:53.70,01:02:55.42
You would go to Hell.

01:02:55.42,01:02:58.70
- I saw your little boy today.[br]- My little one!

01:02:59.30,01:03:01.30
- How was he?[br]- Fine.

01:03:01.82,01:03:05.70
He seemed very sad because you[br]weren't there. He missed you.

01:03:05.70,01:03:09.42
Think how sad he would be[br]if he didn't find you anymore.

01:03:09.70,01:03:11.62
I must go back to bed.

01:03:14.50,01:03:16.90
We all feel desperate in this[br]place,

01:03:16.90,01:03:21.10
but remember that one day[br]you'll leave, and play with your son.

01:03:21.10,01:03:22.82
When?

01:03:23.82,01:03:26.62
- I don't know.[br]- Then why do you say it?

01:03:27.22,01:03:30.10
- Because it's true![br]- Then tell her when.

01:03:31.02,01:03:34.10
In a week, a month, a century?

01:03:34.10,01:03:38.22
I don't know. I'm trying to[br]convince her not to commit suicide.

01:03:38.22,01:03:41.82
I know what you're doing,[br]but I don't know why.

01:05:16.30,01:05:19.62
- I lost St. Christopher, Father.[br]- Let's hurry, or I'll be late.

01:05:58.70,01:06:02.70
Una O'Conner has decided to give[br]herself to the convent.

01:06:04.22,01:06:07.70
This is the biggest recognition[br]that a young repentant

01:06:07.70,01:06:09.70
can give to our order.

01:06:10.62,01:06:15.22
She turned her back on the evils[br]and temptations of the world.

01:06:15.50,01:06:20.42
She'll see the light of the Lord[br]in this convent until her death.

01:06:20.42,01:06:25.90
Her sacrifice and[br]transformation...

01:06:26.22,01:06:28.82
is something that should enlighten[br]all of you.

01:06:31.02,01:06:32.50
Thank you, Una.

01:06:49.02,01:06:52.10
In the name of the Father,[br]the Son and the Holy Spirit.

01:06:52.10,01:06:53.30
Amen.

01:06:53.30,01:06:56.42
- May the Lord be with you.[br]- And with Thy Spirit.

01:06:56.42,01:07:02.02
Grant me justice, oh God, and[br]defend my cause against merciless people.

01:07:02.02,01:07:06.70
Save me from infamous[br]and betraying men.

01:07:09.82,01:07:11.70
- The body of Christ.[br]- Amen.

01:07:13.10,01:07:15.10
- The body of Christ.[br]- Amen.

01:07:17.30,01:07:19.62
- The body of Christ.[br]- Amen.

01:07:31.02,01:07:35.70
Now enter another time,[br]and chat while you enter.

01:07:36.42,01:07:37.90
Go on!

01:07:41.02,01:07:42.50
Stop.

01:07:42.90,01:07:44.70
Smile.

01:07:45.50,01:07:48.82
Now show her the flowers[br]in the garden.

01:07:50.42,01:07:52.82
Relax. Be yourselves!

01:07:54.70,01:07:56.62
Try to be natural.

01:08:12.42,01:08:14.50
He is not a man of God.

01:10:28.22,01:10:31.90
Want a ride?[br]Want a ride or not?

01:10:37.02,01:10:38.90
Why the heck did you stop me?

01:10:41.42,01:10:45.22
You're in there, right?[br]They even take retards now.

01:11:41.90,01:11:44.42
- Lord, have pity on us.[br]- Lord, have pity on us.

01:11:44.42,01:11:47.42
- Christ, have pity on us.[br]- Christ, have pity on us.

01:11:53.42,01:11:57.62
You said you would find[br]my St. Christopher.

01:11:59.42,01:12:01.62
You shouldn't make promises[br]that you can't keep.

01:12:07.62,01:12:10.30
Bernadette says someone[br]must have taken it.

01:12:11.82,01:12:14.62
They're hiding it on purpose.

01:12:16.70,01:12:19.70
You said you would find it.[br]You promised.

01:12:21.82,01:12:25.10
I feel like telling the nuns[br]what you said about Father Fitzroy.

01:12:31.30,01:12:33.70
- Mother of our Redeemer.[br]- Pray for us.

01:12:33.70,01:12:35.82
- Gracious Virgin.[br]- Pray for us.

01:12:35.82,01:12:37.90
- Venerable Virgin.[br]- Pray for us.

01:12:46.02,01:12:47.82
What did you do to my bed?

01:12:49.10,01:12:51.62
My St. Christopher![br]You found it!

01:12:52.42,01:12:54.42
God bless you!

01:12:54.82,01:12:56.82
Disgusting thief!

01:13:08.10,01:13:10.30
Stop it, for the love of God!

01:13:13.42,01:13:16.70
You are a real bitch,[br]a disgusting thief!

01:13:17.30,01:13:20.50
She was hiding Crispina's[br]St. Christopher under her bed.

01:13:20.50,01:13:24.82
The only thing in the world[br]that girl has, and you took it!

01:13:24.82,01:13:28.02
You found my St. Christopher.[br]Thank you.

01:13:28.22,01:13:30.50
Don't you understand?[br]She stole it!

01:13:31.70,01:13:34.22
Yes, but you found it.

01:13:36.42,01:13:40.10
Am I the only one to think[br]that what she did was terrible?

01:13:43.70,01:13:46.10
Then go to hell all of you!

01:14:09.70,01:14:13.10
- Why?[br]- She wasn't suffering enough.

01:14:14.62,01:14:18.70
We must repent, don't forget it.[br]We must suffer.

01:14:21.90,01:14:23.90
Don't annoy me and let me sleep.

01:15:13.90,01:15:16.02
Come on, girls.

01:17:44.50,01:17:47.82
"...but that a man[br]prove himself,

01:17:48.30,01:17:53.22
and eat of that bread[br]and drink from that chalice.

01:17:53.22,01:17:56.22
Because he who eats and drinks[br]without dignity,

01:17:56.22,01:17:59.42
eats and drinks[br]his just punishment.

01:17:59.42,01:18:02.10
That is the word of the Lord."

01:18:02.10,01:18:04.22
Let us give thanks to God.

01:18:04.22,01:18:07.90
A reading from the holy gospel[br]according to John.

01:18:08.10,01:18:10.02
Glory to you, oh Lord.

01:18:10.02,01:18:14.22
"At that time Jesus said[br]to the crowd of Jews:

01:18:14.22,01:18:18.42
My flesh is real food[br]and my blood is a real drink.

01:18:18.82,01:18:24.30
He who eats of my flesh and drinks[br]of my blood, lives inside of Me,

01:18:24.62,01:18:29.22
and I live inside him,[br]like the Father who gives life..."

01:19:21.42,01:19:24.30
I don't know what's happening[br]to me. Help me.

01:19:24.30,01:19:27.42
I don't know why.[br]I feel it all over me.

01:19:28.02,01:19:29.70
Sit down.

01:19:30.42,01:19:32.90
Sit down. Sit down, Crispina.

01:19:33.82,01:19:36.62
- Sit down.[br]- It hurts!

01:19:37.22,01:19:39.10
Crispina.

01:19:40.82,01:19:42.62
It won't go away.

01:19:43.70,01:19:44.90
Please.

01:19:45.42,01:19:47.42
Come on. Sit down.

01:19:50.50,01:19:53.30
- You are not a man of God![br]- Crispina!

01:19:53.30,01:19:57.50
You're not a man of God![br]You're not a man of God!

01:19:57.50,01:20:00.42
You're not a man of God!

01:20:09.50,01:20:13.90
You're not a man of God![br]You're not a man of God!

01:20:38.62,01:20:43.22
You're not a man of God![br]You're not a man of God!

01:20:49.10,01:20:52.10
Crispina, wake up.

01:20:53.70,01:20:55.70
Crispina.

01:20:56.22,01:20:57.90
Come on. Wake up.

01:20:58.42,01:21:00.22
On your feet.

01:21:00.22,01:21:02.62
That's it. Good girl. Come...

01:21:02.62,01:21:04.42
- Let's go.[br]- Where?

01:21:04.42,01:21:06.62
I'm sending you[br]to Mount Vernon hospital.

01:21:06.62,01:21:09.10
They can take better care[br]of you there.

01:21:09.10,01:21:12.30
- Mount Vernon?[br]- Yes, Mount Vernon.

01:21:12.30,01:21:15.42
- Mount Vernon is for lunatics.[br]- Let's go.

01:21:15.42,01:21:18.10
I don't want to go.[br]I'm not crazy.

01:21:18.10,01:21:22.42
Stop, Crispina.[br]Don't create any more problems.

01:21:22.42,01:21:24.22
She told the truth, Sister.

01:21:27.10,01:21:29.62
- What did you say?[br]- Nothing.

01:21:29.62,01:21:32.62
- No, you said something.[br]- I'm sorry. I was confused.

01:21:32.62,01:21:34.50
Confused? I'd say so!

01:21:37.42,01:21:38.82
Enough!

01:21:38.82,01:21:42.02
Crispina,[br]let them take you downstairs.

01:21:42.02,01:21:45.30
Everything is alright.[br]You must relax. Stop it!

01:21:45.90,01:21:49.10
Crispina, be a good girl and[br]relax.

01:21:50.30,01:21:52.90
- Help![br]- Let go of the bed. Let go!

01:21:52.90,01:21:58.42
I said to let go.[br]They won't do anything to you!

01:21:58.42,01:22:00.90
Stop screaming.[br]Let them take you outside.

01:22:01.50,01:22:05.10
Take her away! Don't worry.[br]Nothing will happen to you!

01:23:56.10,01:24:00.22
We know that confession[br]is good for the soul.

01:24:00.22,01:24:04.02
So, in the presence[br]of the archbishop,

01:24:04.02,01:24:08.62
Mr. And Mrs. Lannigan,[br]the sisters, all of you,

01:24:08.62,01:24:10.62
there's a confession I want to[br]make.

01:24:10.62,01:24:14.42
I warn you that you may[br]find it disturbing.

01:24:15.22,01:24:19.22
For many years,[br]more than I can remember,

01:24:19.22,01:24:24.30
I had a secret love...[br]in fact, a dozen of them.

01:24:24.30,01:24:29.70
I've been in love since I was[br]13... with movies.

01:24:31.42,01:24:34.62
It's true![br]My father took me to the movies.

01:24:34.82,01:24:37.10
There were silent films at the[br]time.

01:24:37.10,01:24:42.22
He liked light films,[br]but I liked westerns.

01:24:43.42,01:24:48.02
I'll never forget my mother's[br]expression the day I told her

01:24:48.02,01:24:52.82
that if I didn't join a convent,[br]I would become a cowgirl.

01:24:53.90,01:24:56.42
Fortunately, God gave me[br]the vocation,

01:24:56.42,01:25:01.10
but I never forgot those old[br]movies.

01:25:01.62,01:25:04.90
Today that we celebrate the birth[br]of our Lord Jesus Christ,

01:25:04.90,01:25:09.42
Mr. Lannigan, a respectable[br]businessman from Dublin,

01:25:09.42,01:25:14.90
has brought a projector[br]and a film for us today!

01:25:15.10,01:25:17.22
Isn't it marvelous?

01:25:24.02,01:25:27.30
As you, I don't know[br]what film it is,

01:25:27.30,01:25:30.70
but I know it's not a western.[br]Right, Mr. Lannigan?

01:25:31.50,01:25:33.70
Films have changed greatly[br]since my days,

01:25:33.70,01:25:37.42
and have taken the devil's road,[br]as has much of modern society,

01:25:37.42,01:25:42.02
therefore, non other than[br]the archbishop in person

01:25:42.02,01:25:44.62
chose the film for us today.

01:25:44.62,01:25:48.10
Sister Jude,[br]shut off the lights, please.

01:26:16.50,01:26:20.30
You don't become a nun[br]to escape from life, Bet.

01:26:21.02,01:26:26.30
Not because you lost something,[br]but because you found something.

01:26:31.50,01:26:35.30
Good morning. I have a letter from[br]Father Donnelly for Sister Bridget.

01:26:40.90,01:26:46.50
God of Heaven, take away[br]all the bitterness from my heart.

01:26:52.90,01:26:58.70
Please help me see Your holy will[br]in each thing.

01:27:06.50,01:27:08.30
Please.

01:27:09.22,01:27:11.42
Please help me.

01:27:20.82,01:27:22.42
You can't enter there.

01:27:26.62,01:27:29.70
It's beautiful, beautiful!

01:27:32.02,01:27:34.70
A really wonderful movie.

01:27:34.82,01:27:37.70
I think we should all thank[br]the archbishop.

01:27:37.70,01:27:40.22
Thank you very much.

01:27:42.02,01:27:43.70
What is going on?

01:27:44.02,01:27:48.02
I have a letter here regarding[br]my sister, Margaret Maguire.

01:27:48.02,01:27:51.22
It's from Joseph Donnelly.[br]I am her brother, Eamonn.

01:27:51.30,01:27:53.10
Margaret Maguire.

01:27:54.42,01:27:57.02
Come. Let's go. What is it?

01:27:58.50,01:27:59.90
Let's go!

01:28:06.10,01:28:08.90
Sister Jude,[br]turn on the lights, please.

01:28:10.02,01:28:13.10
Now go back to your dormitories.

01:28:40.02,01:28:42.22
Do you realize how simple it is?

01:28:50.02,01:28:53.02
All it takes is a brother to come.

01:28:56.30,01:28:57.62
Incredible, isn't it?

01:28:58.70,01:29:01.42
- Margaret, hurry up![br]- Don't tell me what I have to do!

01:29:01.42,01:29:05.90
Don't you ever dare again![br]Where have you been these 4 years?

01:29:06.50,01:29:08.90
Are you crazy?[br]I had to grow up!

01:29:08.90,01:29:11.30
You should have grown up[br]more quickly!

01:29:29.82,01:29:34.02
Unfortunately, there wasn't enough[br]time to organize things.

01:29:34.02,01:29:37.42
- We did what we could.[br]- Splendidly, I must say.

01:29:37.42,01:29:40.10
I very much admire[br]this touching reunion.

01:29:42.70,01:29:45.02
Please let me by, Sister.

01:29:46.50,01:29:48.42
I hope you are kidding.

01:29:49.30,01:29:52.90
Do you really think someone[br]here will move aside

01:29:52.90,01:29:56.30
for people like you[br]or your supposed brother?

01:29:56.30,01:29:59.50
I would punish such insolence[br]very severely.

01:30:01.02,01:30:02.82
I am not moving, Sister.

01:30:02.82,01:30:06.70
Okay. It means[br]you will stay here with us.

01:30:11.82,01:30:14.42
"Our Father who art in Heaven,

01:30:14.90,01:30:17.82
hallowed be Thy name.[br]Thy kingdom come,

01:30:17.82,01:30:19.90
Thy will be done,[br]on Earth as it is in Heaven."

01:30:19.90,01:30:22.22
I think we should leave.

01:30:23.50,01:30:25.42
"...and forgive us our trespasses,

01:30:25.42,01:30:27.62
as we forgive those who trespass[br]against us.

01:30:27.62,01:30:32.02
Lead us not into temptation,[br]and deliver us from evil."

01:31:02.22,01:31:04.90
- Excuse me, Sister.[br]- Yes, Katy?

01:31:04.90,01:31:07.90
I don't feel very well today,[br]Sister.

01:31:07.90,01:31:09.70
Drink a glass of water.

01:31:11.22,01:31:12.82
Yes, Sister.

01:31:13.42,01:31:14.90
Jesus, Joseph and Mary.

01:31:49.82,01:31:52.10
Did they tell you I was dying?

01:31:54.50,01:31:58.82
They wanted to send me[br]to the hospital, but I refused.

01:31:58.82,01:32:03.70
I wanted to stay here with[br]the nuns and my friends.

01:32:08.22,01:32:10.50
You knew my mother, didn't you?

01:32:10.70,01:32:13.30
What are you blabbing about,[br]old witch?

01:32:14.02,01:32:16.62
She was always kind to me.

01:32:17.30,01:32:21.90
My father said my brain was weak,

01:32:22.30,01:32:24.62
but she was always kind.

01:32:26.42,01:32:28.70
She had everything from life,[br]yes or no?

01:32:29.22,01:32:30.90
Raise your head.

01:32:34.90,01:32:38.30
She told me to stay away[br]from soldiers.

01:32:40.02,01:32:41.50
She had told me.

01:32:45.30,01:32:50.10
He came into the world[br]on October 15.

01:32:52.50,01:32:54.70
I called him Freddy.

01:32:57.70,01:33:01.10
I hoped my mother[br]would come get me,

01:33:01.70,01:33:04.50
but there were so many of us[br]at home...

01:33:04.82,01:33:06.50
We were poor,

01:33:07.22,01:33:11.22
and she said I would be happy here[br]with the nuns,

01:33:11.22,01:33:13.50
and all my friends.

01:33:16.22,01:33:19.82
Don't leave.[br]Please, don't leave.

01:33:19.82,01:33:22.42
The nuns don't want you[br]to leave me alone.

01:33:23.22,01:33:26.70
I'll tell the nuns[br]if you leave me alone.

01:33:35.22,01:33:37.90
All the sisters want[br]is that the work be done.

01:33:37.90,01:33:40.22
Don't you realize that?

01:33:44.02,01:33:47.30
The sisters don't care[br]about you, and neither do I.

01:33:49.10,01:33:52.50
So do yourself and me a big favor.

01:33:53.02,01:33:54.70
Hurry up and die.

01:34:10.50,01:34:11.90
Here he is.

01:34:12.42,01:34:16.50
If you'll come with me to my[br]office, we'll fill out the documents.

01:34:33.82,01:34:35.30
Come in.

01:34:42.82,01:34:46.02
Sorry to bother you, Sister.[br]I'd like to ask you something.

01:34:47.82,01:34:49.90
It will soon be my son's birthday.

01:34:51.42,01:34:55.70
I was wondering if I could send[br]him a birthday card.

01:34:55.70,01:35:01.42
I know you can't tell me where[br]he is, but if I give it to you,

01:35:01.42,01:35:04.82
you could send it to the people[br]he is living with.

01:35:06.62,01:35:10.70
Help me look for a key this big.[br]It's the key to that.

01:35:13.10,01:35:15.02
Come on! Look for it!

01:35:26.62,01:35:28.62
Where can it be?

01:35:34.30,01:35:37.30
It's just a birthday card, Sister.

01:35:37.30,01:35:40.22
I won't sign it,[br]and he won't know who sent it.

01:35:40.22,01:35:41.70
It would be foolish

01:35:41.70,01:35:44.90
to send a birthday card to a child[br]who doesn't know who sends it.

01:35:44.90,01:35:47.90
You would confuse him[br]and ruin his birthday.

01:35:49.22,01:35:51.22
- But I am his mother.[br]- No, you're not.

01:35:52.02,01:35:55.02
A mother puts a child to bed,[br]comforts him, feeds him,

01:35:55.02,01:35:57.90
dresses him, educates him![br]You did nothing of all this.

01:35:57.90,01:35:59.90
Do you want to take credit[br]for something you didn't do?

01:35:59.90,01:36:01.10
No, Sister.

01:36:01.10,01:36:04.70
Then forget this nonsense[br]and look for that darn key!

01:36:06.42,01:36:09.22
I didn't want that![br]It's just...

01:36:11.10,01:36:13.02
The cookie boxes were perfect.

01:36:14.30,01:36:18.82
I should've put it in another[br]place. There's all that money in there.

01:36:18.82,01:36:20.62
Did you find it?

01:36:23.50,01:36:25.10
No, Sister.

01:36:26.02,01:36:27.90
I'm sorry, Sister.

01:36:47.30,01:36:48.30
Oh, God!

01:36:48.30,01:36:49.90
That nice lady is here.

01:36:49.90,01:36:51.70
They didn't tell her!

01:36:52.90,01:36:54.50
She's not here!

01:36:55.62,01:36:57.62
They took her away[br]over a year ago!

01:36:59.02,01:37:02.30
- They should have told you.[br]- Patricia!

01:37:06.22,01:37:08.30
Oh, God. Let's go.

01:37:14.62,01:37:16.50
Aren't you dead yet?

01:37:31.62,01:37:33.70
You got what you deserved.

01:38:11.90,01:38:13.42
I just wanted...

01:38:30.30,01:38:33.30
Excuse me, Sister.[br]Katy is dead.

01:38:33.70,01:38:35.62
May she rest in peace.

01:38:38.22,01:38:40.22
Remember this punishment.

01:38:40.22,01:38:43.42
If you talk with someone[br]from outside again,

01:38:43.42,01:38:46.62
you'll receive the same treatment[br]every day for a month.

01:38:47.42,01:38:49.02
Now,

01:38:50.02,01:38:51.62
both of you,

01:38:52.82,01:38:54.70
go back to work.

01:39:32.50,01:39:35.42
Do you know that we'll get old[br]and die in here?

01:39:38.22,01:39:39.82
Nobody will come for me.

01:39:41.82,01:39:43.90
Or for you, either.

01:39:46.62,01:39:49.50
I don't want to feel like this[br]for the rest of my life.

01:39:52.22,01:39:54.90
I don't want to end up[br]like one of them.

01:39:58.22,01:39:59.62
Well, are you ready?

01:40:01.22,01:40:02.82
Ready for what?

01:40:02.82,01:40:06.02
- We have to go.[br]- Go where?

01:40:06.10,01:40:07.50
Away.

01:40:07.50,01:40:10.30
Are you completely mad?

01:40:10.30,01:40:14.42
Look what she did to me[br]just because I spoke to someone.

01:40:14.42,01:40:17.70
What would she do if I got caught[br]trying to leave?

01:40:18.30,01:40:21.62
It doesn't matter.[br]She'd do it anyway.

01:40:22.90,01:40:27.30
For something or for nothing.[br]It has no importance for her.

01:40:28.50,01:40:30.10
We have to leave.

01:40:30.70,01:40:32.50
We have to leave right now.

01:41:11.50,01:41:13.70
What's the front door key[br]look like?

01:41:13.70,01:41:14.90
It's big and black.

01:41:44.70,01:41:46.62
Give me that key!

01:41:51.42,01:41:52.90
What are you doing?

01:41:54.30,01:41:55.62
Stop.

01:42:03.30,01:42:05.22
Give me the key.

01:42:10.82,01:42:12.22
Give it to me!

01:42:18.02,01:42:19.42
Give me the key, Sister!

01:42:20.90,01:42:23.90
Leave the key, disgusting witch!

01:42:27.62,01:42:30.22
Leave it or I swear I'll stick[br]this down your throat!

01:42:38.50,01:42:39.90
Give me the key.

01:42:54.42,01:42:56.62
Stop! Stop!

01:42:57.02,01:42:59.50
- Stop![br]- Go away! Don't touch her!

01:43:07.70,01:43:10.90
Don't you dare follow us!

01:43:25.30,01:43:27.30
Stay in there, damn it!

01:45:12.50,01:45:15.10
Thanks again for the money,[br]clothes and everything.

01:45:15.10,01:45:18.30
As soon as I find a job,[br]I'll pay you back. I promise.

01:45:18.90,01:45:20.42
Good luck, Patricia.

01:45:21.70,01:45:24.02
- My name is Rose.[br]- Rose.

01:45:24.90,01:45:26.30
Wait a minute.

01:45:39.22,01:45:43.42
- Will you manage?[br]- I have my ticket. I'll make it.

01:45:47.70,01:45:49.50
Liverpool is in England, right?

01:45:51.10,01:45:52.90
Yes, I think so.

01:45:55.50,01:45:59.02
What about you?[br]She'll get the police after you!

01:45:59.02,01:46:02.42
They can't touch me.[br]I'm an apprentice hairdresser.

01:46:02.42,01:46:04.50
Therefore, respectable.

01:46:04.50,01:46:07.42
They can't touch you[br]if you're respectable.

01:46:09.42,01:46:10.90
I'll write to you.

01:46:12.02,01:46:13.42
Alright.

01:46:17.02,01:46:18.22
Good luck.

01:47:46.02,01:47:47.10
Sit down!

01:48:00.42,01:48:04.62
