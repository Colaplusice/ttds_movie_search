1
00:00:14,932 --> 00:00:19,494
I'm a good person
I'm a hard worker

2
00:00:19,670 --> 00:00:22,662
My older sister is
the only family I have

3
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:25,037
To put me through
art school

4
00:00:25,142 --> 00:00:28,669
she gave up college
and got a job at a factory

5
00:00:28,846 --> 00:00:33,749
But then she fell seriously
ill and had to quit

6
00:00:33,884 --> 00:00:37,786
So I gave up art school
and got a job

7
00:00:37,988 --> 00:00:42,789
But recently
I made a decision

8
00:00:43,761 --> 00:00:47,663
I'm not sure whether
to tell my sister or not

9
00:00:47,765 --> 00:00:51,326
I'm hesitating even
as I write this letter

10
00:00:51,835 --> 00:00:55,498
If I decide to do it

11
00:00:55,639 --> 00:00:58,506
I'll be listening to the
broadcast with my sister

12
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:02,968
I can't speak with my mouth

13
00:01:04,915 --> 00:01:11,013
I'm deaf and dumb

14
00:01:13,857 --> 00:01:20,194
Please read this letter to my
sister for me, since I can't

15
00:01:22,466 --> 00:01:25,458
Sis, you're listening?

16
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:28,772
You told me if you die
you want to be buried by

17
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:30,773
the river where
we used to play

18
00:01:30,908 --> 00:01:34,071
Alright,
I'll do that

19
00:01:34,178 --> 00:01:38,444
But that'll be in
40 or 50 years' time

20
00:01:38,582 --> 00:01:44,248
I'm going to save you...
Really, I swear

21
00:01:44,455 --> 00:01:50,451
Actually, I registered to
donate my kidney today

22
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:53,025
I know you
said not to that you'd rather die

23
00:01:53,097 --> 00:01:56,032
that you'd rather die
than be a burden

24
00:01:56,233 --> 00:01:59,532
But you know I never
do what I'm told

25
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:16,110
Not A type

26
00:02:16,687 --> 00:02:20,214
if the blood types
don't match

27
00:02:24,728 --> 00:02:26,628
then we can't do
a transplant

28
00:02:26,697 --> 00:02:32,761
You haven't had test
since school, have you?

29
00:02:34,838 --> 00:02:39,969
If you can't pay
take her home for now

30
00:02:40,210 --> 00:02:43,771
Until we find
a suitable donor

31
00:02:45,682 --> 00:02:49,140
just keep coming
in for dialysis

32
00:02:49,453 --> 00:02:51,080
ok?

33
00:03:11,708 --> 00:03:15,838
It's type B, B

34
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:28,839
<i>[Kidneys wanted.  We pay top dollar.
<i>Experienced doctors. 24/7. Call us now!]</i>

35
00:09:21,945 --> 00:09:23,435
Our new house
is an old house

36
00:09:23,513 --> 00:09:25,378
The estate thought
it'd be OK for I'm deaf

37
00:09:40,463 --> 00:09:45,400
If sister can't sleep
then neither can I

38
00:09:53,276 --> 00:09:57,076
Aw, fucking great!

39
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:49,477
<i>- Attention -

41
00:11:58,368 --> 00:12:00,336
I heard that

42
00:12:02,105 --> 00:12:05,302
this happened
in Australia

43
00:12:10,413 --> 00:12:13,075
A man...

44
00:12:13,683 --> 00:12:20,282
thought he had
two heads

45
00:12:26,863 --> 00:12:28,763
Two heads?

46
00:12:28,832 --> 00:12:31,062
Yeah, two

47
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:34,562
And

48
00:12:34,637 --> 00:12:37,902
he kept getting
headaches

49
00:12:38,575 --> 00:12:41,043
With two heads

50
00:12:41,144 --> 00:12:44,602
he had headaches
all the time

51
00:12:46,516 --> 00:12:49,076
So you know
what he did?

52
00:12:54,991 --> 00:13:02,363
He shot
one of his heads

53
00:13:09,072 --> 00:13:11,006
The left
or the right?

54
00:14:19,709 --> 00:14:22,610
Aren't you
going to lunch?

55
00:14:22,679 --> 00:14:25,705
Come on

56
00:14:26,683 --> 00:14:28,844
let's go
eat something

57
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,578
You've only
got 10 million won?

58
00:16:42,652 --> 00:16:46,952
Well, first of all

59
00:16:47,690 --> 00:16:51,922
give us your kidney
then we'll do it

60
00:16:52,195 --> 00:16:56,063
You give us
yours and we'll

61
00:16:56,232 --> 00:16:58,132
get you one
for your sister

62
00:16:58,301 --> 00:17:00,269
For 10 million won
Got it?

63
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:08,509
Understand me?

64
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:42,610
Your blood type's B
right?

65
00:20:09,125 --> 00:20:12,253
21 days later
Congratulations

66
00:20:12,395 --> 00:20:15,762
Finding a donor
this fast is

67
00:20:15,965 --> 00:20:18,866
simply a miracle

68
00:20:19,469 --> 00:20:24,133
The surgery's in a week

69
00:20:24,207 --> 00:20:28,268
so have her
admitted in 5 days

70
00:20:29,812 --> 00:20:33,009
You said you had
10 million won, right?

71
00:20:34,150 --> 00:20:40,555
So all your
problems are solved

72
00:20:49,932 --> 00:20:52,059
Isn't it great?

73
00:20:54,136 --> 00:20:58,664
You idiot
You stupid fuck!

74
00:21:02,545 --> 00:21:06,538
That money would've
saved your sister

75
00:21:19,662 --> 00:21:21,596
Why not?

76
00:21:23,699 --> 00:21:26,190
not the time to
be thinking that way

77
00:21:26,302 --> 00:21:28,566
There's a saying

78
00:21:28,871 --> 00:21:32,602
Is a boiled pig afraid
of boiling water?

79
00:21:32,675 --> 00:21:34,302
Besides

80
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:38,211
What are you going to do?
You've only got a week

81
00:21:38,281 --> 00:21:40,215
You know how long

82
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:43,377
it'll take to find
another donor?

83
00:21:56,632 --> 00:21:58,259
Is that her?

84
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,997
She's cute

85
00:22:06,309 --> 00:22:08,004
Must be a friend

86
00:22:16,352 --> 00:22:19,014
That's the bastard
who fired you?

87
00:22:22,224 --> 00:22:27,252
That car's worth
10 years of your salary

88
00:22:27,463 --> 00:22:30,762
That's why we
need a revolution

89
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:33,960
So sick people will
get free treatment

90
00:22:34,070 --> 00:22:35,697
The time must come

91
00:22:35,838 --> 00:22:39,501
when you can get any

92
00:22:39,642 --> 00:22:41,735
damned organ you need!

93
00:22:44,146 --> 00:22:46,580
The bad image

94
00:22:46,849 --> 00:22:49,750
they get is cause
kids keep getting killed

95
00:22:49,819 --> 00:22:52,686
But we're different

96
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:56,656
Give us money, we'll
return the kid pronto

97
00:22:56,859 --> 00:23:01,728
I'm afraid
She won't want to go home

98
00:23:01,831 --> 00:23:05,460
She'll be playing
with us all the time

99
00:23:05,601 --> 00:23:07,626
Won't have to go to school

100
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:14,242
What? What?

101
00:23:18,881 --> 00:23:20,815
It's summer vacation

102
00:23:36,732 --> 00:23:41,328
But think about it from
parents' point of view

103
00:23:41,404 --> 00:23:44,202
They'll be so happy
to see her again

104
00:23:44,273 --> 00:23:48,607
They'll love her more
and the family will be closer

105
00:23:48,878 --> 00:23:53,611
we'll ask for
exactly 26 million won

106
00:23:53,783 --> 00:23:56,718
How conscientious is
that right?

107
00:23:58,988 --> 00:24:02,287
That money's nothing
to them

108
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:05,259
but for us it's a
matter of life and death

109
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:09,354
Movement of capital
maximizes the value of money

110
00:24:09,432 --> 00:24:11,559
it's not a crime
don't you think?

111
00:24:26,248 --> 00:24:27,875
There are...

112
00:24:30,419 --> 00:24:34,446
good kidnappings
and bad kidnappings

113
00:24:35,224 --> 00:24:39,558
Good kidnapping enlists
the parents' cooperation

114
00:24:40,930 --> 00:24:46,061
If they call the
police, the kid dies

115
00:24:46,368 --> 00:24:48,563
The parents pay up

116
00:24:49,138 --> 00:24:51,333
and the kid gets returned

117
00:24:51,574 --> 00:24:53,974
Then nobody finds
out about it

118
00:24:54,110 --> 00:24:59,810
People think all
kidnappings are bad

119
00:25:24,373 --> 00:25:26,136
Daddy!

120
00:25:26,776 --> 00:25:27,834
What?

121
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:30,777
Can I go play
at Yoosun's house?

122
00:25:31,347 --> 00:25:32,678
No

123
00:25:32,748 --> 00:25:36,047
Then will you buy me a
cell phone like Yoosun's?

124
00:25:37,753 --> 00:25:42,190
Why do you buy
her stuff like that?

125
00:25:42,258 --> 00:25:45,591
Have consideration
for your neighbors

126
00:26:02,778 --> 00:26:04,507
Peng!

127
00:26:05,447 --> 00:26:07,074
President Park!

128
00:26:07,183 --> 00:26:10,516
Sir, please help me!

129
00:26:10,586 --> 00:26:14,613
My wife ran off and
my kids are starving

130
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:19,827
In six years I never
missed a day of work

131
00:26:20,029 --> 00:26:24,261
You know the percentage
of faulty goods was 0.008%

132
00:26:24,333 --> 00:26:26,164
0.008%

133
00:26:26,268 --> 00:26:27,963
Peng
what are you doing?

134
00:26:28,137 --> 00:26:30,264
I explained it
to you already

135
00:26:41,517 --> 00:26:43,781
An employee of yours?

136
00:27:09,445 --> 00:27:18,547
I gave away my youth
to Ilshin Electronics

137
00:28:05,467 --> 00:28:08,095
-Are you OK?
-Daddy!

138
00:28:36,966 --> 00:28:38,365
It's not going to work

139
00:28:38,434 --> 00:28:39,731
Why?

140
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:45,306
Look at him
I was fired by the kid's father

141
00:28:45,941 --> 00:28:51,880
I'll be the first
person the police call in

142
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:00,220
Then what do we do?

143
00:29:04,994 --> 00:29:18,840
Defeat the communists
the way for Korea is victory

144
00:29:18,941 --> 00:29:32,082
Let's go for Freedom
Down

145
00:29:32,254 --> 00:29:38,215
Defeat the communists

146
00:29:38,293 --> 00:29:45,790
the way for
Korea is victory

147
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,491
By the way

148
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,440
how come Daddy's
friend is so poor?

149
00:31:03,011 --> 00:31:04,308
Huh?

150
00:31:05,414 --> 00:31:12,684
We spent a lot of
money because I'm sick

151
00:31:14,189 --> 00:31:17,886
What hospital is
your mother in?

152
00:31:21,630 --> 00:31:26,567
She doesn't know
about the car accident

153
00:31:52,494 --> 00:32:01,698
Daddy was too busy
so they got divorced

154
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,337
so

155
00:32:06,475 --> 00:32:10,775
That's why
he left me with you

156
00:32:16,718 --> 00:32:20,882
Mine?

157
00:32:37,339 --> 00:32:39,170
Don't cry
Stop it!

158
00:32:42,611 --> 00:32:45,705
Please
Stop

159
00:33:17,879 --> 00:33:21,315
He wants to trade
it for your doll

160
00:33:32,861 --> 00:33:36,888
Daddy loves Yoosun

161
00:33:37,032 --> 00:33:41,867
Yoosun loves Daddy, too

162
00:35:34,349 --> 00:35:37,750
Sis

163
00:35:44,960 --> 00:35:49,021
More than anything

164
00:35:49,664 --> 00:35:56,866
I'm jealous of girls with
mommys to braid their hair

165
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:17,022
Then come see me sometime

166
00:36:17,259 --> 00:36:20,023
Really?

167
00:36:36,411 --> 00:36:40,177
Call me anytime

168
00:36:40,282 --> 00:36:44,582
I'm all alone, so I get bored

169
00:39:17,624 --> 00:39:20,424
<i>Statement of Severance Pay:
<i>[6,550,628 won]</i>

170
00:39:36,825 --> 00:39:43,060
He never said why he
missed work so often?

171
00:39:44,633 --> 00:39:50,333
Then he never went off
for special training?

172
00:39:51,439 --> 00:39:56,934
Yes he did, last week from
Monday to Wednesday

173
00:41:56,831 --> 00:42:00,358
She's washing

174
00:42:51,786 --> 00:42:58,350
Give it!
I'm watching cartoons

What's the use if I get a kidney...</i>

All I want is for you to be happy.</i>

<i>Goodbye. I love you.</i>

178
00:45:11,592 --> 00:45:15,585
Is anybody
out there?

179
00:45:22,470 --> 00:45:25,871
Somebody help me

180
00:49:33,421 --> 00:49:37,653
Go away!

181
00:49:48,703 --> 00:49:51,001
Ryu!

182
00:49:51,606 --> 00:49:53,836
Ryu!

183
00:50:00,648 --> 00:50:02,707
Ryu!

184
00:50:19,967 --> 00:50:27,237
Ryu! Ryu! Ryu!

185
00:50:55,169 --> 00:50:56,830
Ryu!

186
00:52:11,078 --> 00:52:14,013
The water's deep there
it's far over my head

187
00:53:41,101 --> 00:53:45,037
Later I realized why
I thought the water was deep

188
00:53:45,139 --> 00:53:48,540
When I was a kid
it was up over my head

189
00:55:54,268 --> 00:55:59,729
Have you ever done
anything to provoke anyone?

190
00:56:01,609 --> 00:56:05,670
Please think again

191
00:56:07,648 --> 00:56:09,513
I always thought

192
00:56:10,284 --> 00:56:13,811
I lived an honest life

193
00:56:18,225 --> 00:56:20,659
But think

194
00:56:21,929 --> 00:56:26,923
Pardon me for asking, but
what is your net worth?

195
00:56:28,569 --> 00:56:30,594
I'm a high school graduate

196
00:56:31,639 --> 00:56:34,199
and I started as
an electrical engineer

197
00:56:38,078 --> 00:56:40,012
My wife left me when

198
00:56:42,216 --> 00:56:44,047
the economy crashed

199
00:56:48,389 --> 00:56:49,947
But why...

200
00:56:52,059 --> 00:56:54,027
I don't understand

201
00:56:57,731 --> 00:57:01,599
Why didn't you
call the police?

202
00:57:03,971 --> 00:57:08,203
I thought lots of
kids returned safely

203
00:57:09,610 --> 00:57:12,204
If I do what
they tell me

204
00:57:13,914 --> 00:57:17,350
Sir, I checked

205
00:57:17,451 --> 00:57:20,181
it looks like they
used this phone number

206
00:57:20,287 --> 00:57:24,018
they didn't answer
so we can't locate them

207
00:57:24,224 --> 00:57:27,785
It's this number, right?

208
00:57:33,100 --> 00:57:37,002
My wife gave it to
her before she left

209
00:57:45,145 --> 00:57:47,238
Just a second

210
00:57:53,787 --> 00:57:55,277
Yeah

211
00:57:55,589 --> 00:57:57,614
I'm working

212
00:57:59,693 --> 00:58:01,217
So an operation will

213
00:58:01,428 --> 00:58:03,259
take care of it?

214
00:58:08,135 --> 00:58:11,536
Where would I get
10 million won?

215
00:58:13,774 --> 00:58:15,264
am I supposed to do?

216
00:58:19,246 --> 00:58:24,684
At least kid wasn't
kidnapped and killed

217
00:58:26,019 --> 00:58:28,510
We're lucky you know

218
00:58:28,655 --> 00:58:32,216
Cause we don't
have any money

219
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:54,834
Saw

220
01:00:09,923 --> 01:00:11,015
Lift up

221
01:00:12,359 --> 01:00:16,489
One, Two, Three

222
01:00:24,371 --> 01:00:25,497
Saw

223
01:00:33,213 --> 01:00:35,511
Lung was swollen badly

224
01:01:20,761 --> 01:01:24,754
It looks like a
woman's handwriting

225
01:01:27,134 --> 01:01:29,432
Do you recognize it?

226
01:01:53,527 --> 01:01:56,360
Yoosun

227
01:05:25,172 --> 01:05:33,910
Why didn't you give
me swimming lessons?

228
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:22,618
I put this house
up for sale

229
01:07:24,663 --> 01:07:26,756
and I sold
the company, too

230
01:07:29,601 --> 01:07:31,296
That's all

231
01:07:35,207 --> 01:07:38,074
the money I have

232
01:07:59,798 --> 01:08:02,631
there's nothing
special about it

233
01:08:02,768 --> 01:08:06,260
A brother and
sister lived here

234
01:08:06,405 --> 01:08:09,670
They don't know
where they moved to

235
01:08:14,179 --> 01:08:16,079
I'll look into it

236
01:08:26,725 --> 01:08:27,817
Let's go

237
01:08:27,993 --> 01:08:29,585
Nothing more to see here

238
01:08:41,673 --> 01:08:44,039
You asked if
I ever provoked anyone?

239
01:10:02,387 --> 01:10:04,617
Are you the father?

240
01:10:04,756 --> 01:10:08,487
-Well, actually
-I am

241
01:10:08,727 --> 01:10:11,195
How is he?

242
01:10:14,700 --> 01:10:17,669
If I were a very
optimistic doctor

243
01:10:17,970 --> 01:10:20,996
I'd tell you
there was hope

244
01:10:22,241 --> 01:10:25,699
this is my guess

245
01:11:24,937 --> 01:11:27,872
When did you know
we'd become like this?

246
01:11:29,841 --> 01:11:31,775
The moment our eyes met

247
01:11:34,012 --> 01:11:35,411
You're like an ant

248
01:11:35,981 --> 01:11:36,913
An ant?

249
01:11:38,116 --> 01:11:42,052
They say ants are psychic

250
01:11:42,788 --> 01:11:46,724
They predict
earthquakes and floods

251
01:13:31,563 --> 01:13:34,555
Baek Hyun-jin's "Affection"

252
01:13:34,666 --> 01:13:38,067
requested by a man who
signed Ryu of Doksan-dong

253
01:13:38,270 --> 01:13:40,966
Any of you remember
this guy?

254
01:13:41,440 --> 01:13:43,340
He was deaf

255
01:13:43,408 --> 01:13:47,742
He sent a letter
saying his sister was sick

256
01:13:48,380 --> 01:13:52,373
Oh, no
She passed away

257
01:13:53,118 --> 01:13:55,211
He says, "I'm the
one who killed her"

258
01:13:55,320 --> 01:14:00,257
"My life has no
meaning now."

259
01:14:01,059 --> 01:14:03,323
You shouldn't
say that

260
01:14:03,462 --> 01:14:07,728
Would she want to
see you like this?

261
01:14:07,899 --> 01:14:12,768
Don't forget she's
watching you from above

262
01:14:12,871 --> 01:14:16,398
I know
you can't hear me

263
01:14:16,508 --> 01:14:20,877
but me and our
listening audience

264
01:14:21,012 --> 01:14:23,606
are praying for you

265
01:14:24,015 --> 01:14:25,744
Be strong

266
01:14:25,851 --> 01:14:27,842
To help you out

267
01:14:27,919 --> 01:14:29,546
I'll send you a new
Kimchi refrigerator

268
01:14:29,788 --> 01:14:33,815
It hasn't an address
so if anyone listening to

269
01:14:33,892 --> 01:14:37,828
broadcast knows him
please let him know

270
01:14:39,030 --> 01:14:43,364
We're waiting for such
touching stories from you

271
01:14:43,502 --> 01:14:45,060
If there's a story
you want to tell

272
01:14:45,137 --> 01:14:48,800
send me a letter

273
01:14:48,907 --> 01:14:57,838
Our address is Seoul
Yeongdungpo Yeouido...

274
01:14:58,183 --> 01:15:01,414
I kept them cause the
pictures were pretty

275
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:04,318
I cried so much
while reading them

276
01:15:09,995 --> 01:15:11,622
But

277
01:15:11,696 --> 01:15:14,824
is he
really a kidnapper?

278
01:15:16,701 --> 01:15:20,762
Don't send him a gift
You haven't sent it?

279
01:17:35,106 --> 01:17:37,199
Two, three

280
01:18:38,573 --> 01:18:40,773
<i>Daewoo Matiz, orange colour
<i>plate # 3296</i>

281
01:18:43,174 --> 01:18:45,404
He's mentally disabled,

282
01:18:45,543 --> 01:18:47,670
not stupid

283
01:19:14,639 --> 01:19:17,403
President Park,
this is Choi

284
01:19:23,448 --> 01:19:27,475
the results are out
and we checked the car

285
01:19:27,585 --> 01:19:29,610
Yes, I know that place

286
01:19:30,855 --> 01:19:34,552
I'll see you
there at 2:00

287
01:19:48,807 --> 01:19:52,140
Yes, I'm calling
about the sticker...

288
01:19:53,611 --> 01:19:56,102
Yeah, the kidney
transplant

289
01:19:57,949 --> 01:19:59,314
Yes

290
01:20:00,452 --> 01:20:03,944
She wouldn't have
lived long anyway

291
01:20:04,122 --> 01:20:08,582
I searched hospitals
and found her file

292
01:20:10,395 --> 01:20:14,729
They managed to get a
kidney from someone

293
01:20:14,799 --> 01:20:17,165
but apparently they
didn't have money

294
01:20:18,269 --> 01:20:19,930
President Park

295
01:20:21,439 --> 01:20:25,466
What I really
want to ask is

296
01:20:25,643 --> 01:20:29,545
What are you going to do
to when you find them?

297
01:20:29,681 --> 01:20:31,410
Kill them

298
01:21:08,620 --> 01:21:12,920
Dismantle
the conglomerates!

299
01:21:17,095 --> 01:21:20,258
Drive out the
U.S. Army!

300
01:21:24,869 --> 01:21:28,532
Destroy
the new liberalism

301
01:21:35,113 --> 01:21:38,139
that ruins the lives
of the people!

302
01:21:43,688 --> 01:21:47,488
Destroy the new liberalism

303
01:22:02,740 --> 01:22:04,503
I understand

304
01:22:04,642 --> 01:22:08,271
I'll wire you the money
tomorrow and then call you back

305
01:22:21,960 --> 01:22:24,588
Destroy
the conglomerates!

306
01:22:26,664 --> 01:22:29,155
Destroy
the conglomerates!

307
01:22:30,268 --> 01:22:32,566
Drive out the
U.S. Army

308
01:23:24,088 --> 01:23:26,249
Are you going far?

309
01:23:28,459 --> 01:23:29,926
Hell, yeah

310
01:24:36,728 --> 01:24:40,459
Shit, you said
I could go first!

311
01:25:43,694 --> 01:25:47,061
It's in an artery
Chulseung

312
01:25:49,100 --> 01:25:50,727
Don't take it out!

313
01:26:01,245 --> 01:26:03,110
Mom

314
01:27:21,993 --> 01:27:25,724
The noodles were all
soggy last time

315
01:27:26,631 --> 01:27:29,361
Yeah, hurry

316
01:27:43,047 --> 01:27:45,413
Huh?

317
01:28:54,018 --> 01:28:55,883
Where is the bastard?

318
01:28:56,988 --> 01:28:58,512
Fuck you

319
01:29:25,349 --> 01:29:27,010
Where?

320
01:29:29,820 --> 01:29:31,219
Fuck you

321
01:29:31,355 --> 01:29:33,915
Tell me
you bitch!

322
01:29:36,994 --> 01:29:38,188
Fuck

323
01:30:37,788 --> 01:30:42,589
Next time, don't
order just one dish

324
01:31:57,401 --> 01:31:58,766
Mister

325
01:31:59,703 --> 01:32:01,193
Yoosun

326
01:32:02,106 --> 01:32:04,973
We didn't kill
her on purpose

327
01:32:06,277 --> 01:32:08,177
I'm sorry

328
01:32:08,646 --> 01:32:10,773
we made a mistake

329
01:32:12,116 --> 01:32:16,815
But I have something
to tell you

330
01:32:21,826 --> 01:32:26,957
I'm not just any
ordinary person

331
01:32:30,267 --> 01:32:33,236
If anything
happens to me

332
01:32:34,104 --> 01:32:38,302
my organization
is a terrorist group

333
01:32:39,376 --> 01:32:41,571
They'll kill you

334
01:32:41,946 --> 01:32:45,746
100%
For sure

335
01:32:49,486 --> 01:32:51,647
I gave them
your picture

336
01:32:55,359 --> 01:32:59,819
If you want to live
just leave me

337
01:33:00,965 --> 01:33:03,593
This is for your sake

338
01:33:03,901 --> 01:33:05,766
Honestly

339
01:33:10,641 --> 01:33:12,199
And

340
01:33:14,545 --> 01:33:16,638
I'm sorry

341
01:33:19,483 --> 01:33:21,075
100%

342
01:34:35,993 --> 01:34:39,429
She sat next to
the deaf kid

343
01:34:39,530 --> 01:34:44,297
so she's deaf, too?

344
01:34:44,401 --> 01:34:45,891
No

345
01:34:46,070 --> 01:34:50,063
how come she went
to same school?

346
01:34:50,240 --> 01:34:52,435
So
what I mean is

347
01:34:52,543 --> 01:34:55,137
she got expelled

348
01:34:55,245 --> 01:34:57,645
when was find out
she wasn't deaf

349
01:34:57,982 --> 01:35:01,679
She went to college
and was a left wing activist

350
01:35:01,785 --> 01:35:06,119
sneaked onto a boat once
trying to reach N-Korea

351
01:35:06,256 --> 01:35:07,951
And?

352
01:35:10,361 --> 01:35:13,626
She got caught
by some fishermen

353
01:35:13,697 --> 01:35:16,257
caught her in a net
while she was swimming

354
01:35:16,500 --> 01:35:20,368
She's part of the RAA

355
01:35:20,437 --> 01:35:21,699
What?

356
01:35:21,772 --> 01:35:23,637
I mean, she was

357
01:35:25,676 --> 01:35:29,806
Go to Intelligence
and bring a few of them

358
01:35:29,913 --> 01:35:31,938
The problem is...

359
01:35:32,082 --> 01:35:37,349
she was the only
member of RAA

360
01:36:14,725 --> 01:36:17,751
Make way please
excuse me

361
01:36:21,031 --> 01:36:25,468
Excuse me

362
01:36:41,752 --> 01:36:44,880
we're coming through

363
01:37:09,847 --> 01:37:12,543
I'm sorry
you can't ride here

364
01:37:24,928 --> 01:37:29,262
Its C-3
They found some of

365
01:37:29,366 --> 01:37:32,301
Cha Youngmi's flyers
at a crime scene

366
01:37:33,403 --> 01:37:35,166
What scene?

367
01:37:35,939 --> 01:37:38,203
Three people
were murdered

368
01:41:05,916 --> 01:41:06,883
Yes

369
01:41:07,117 --> 01:41:11,577
The organ dealers
are dead!

370
01:41:11,688 --> 01:41:13,053
But their sides

371
01:41:13,123 --> 01:41:17,219
are cut open
You know...

372
01:41:17,361 --> 01:41:19,852
He took
the kidneys!

373
01:41:21,298 --> 01:41:22,629
President Park

374
01:41:22,699 --> 01:41:25,031
he seems like a real psycho

375
01:41:25,135 --> 01:41:29,128
Killed three people
He isn't human

376
01:41:29,272 --> 01:41:31,263
Give this up now

377
01:41:31,575 --> 01:41:33,736
I'll return all your money

378
01:48:53,149 --> 01:48:59,520
I know you're a good guy

379
01:49:04,527 --> 01:49:07,155
But you know why

380
01:49:11,734 --> 01:49:16,137
I have to kill you?

381
01:49:18,007 --> 01:49:20,669
Understand?

382
01:49:21,644 --> 01:49:25,546
Huh?
you know?

383
01:51:35,645 --> 01:51:39,877
-Hello?
-Yes, this is Inchon Hospital...

384
01:51:39,949 --> 01:51:43,112
Is the boy's father there?

385
01:51:43,353 --> 01:51:49,622
He died just now, at 12:20...

386
01:51:49,726 --> 01:51:53,218
The mortuary's on floor B2

387
01:51:53,329 --> 01:51:54,921
You've got the wrong number

388
01:51:55,031 --> 01:51:55,861
What?

389
01:55:14,877 --> 01:55:17,577
<i>- Statement -
<i>We know you're the one who
<i>murdered our beloved comrade.</i>

390
01:55:17,578 --> 01:55:19,478
<i>Here is the holy justice for you.
<i>2001.10.23</i>

391
01:56:02,578 --> 01:56:04,409
Mister

392
01:56:06,983 --> 01:56:09,975
If anything
happens to me

393
01:56:10,786 --> 01:56:15,052
my organization
is a terrorist group

394
01:56:16,025 --> 01:56:18,255
They'll kill you.

395
01:56:18,728 --> 01:56:22,425
100%
For sure.

396
01:56:24,166 --> 01:56:27,260
I gave them your picture

397
01:57:45,061 --> 01:57:50,061
