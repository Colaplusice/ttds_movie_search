1
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:49,675
Look at this. He's alive.

2
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:51,950
This dog, you call it bull pit?

3
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,832
No, pit bull. That's no pit bull.

4
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:57,430
I don't know what he is. Bet he
lost somebody some money, though.

5
00:00:57,560 --> 00:01:01,473
- Give me your gun.
- Shooting him? Are you sick?

6
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,068
They left him out to suffer and die.

7
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,316
They threw him out
the fucking window.

8
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:10,149
- Terrible. People wait for us.
- They're used to waiting.

9
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:15,556
Poor little guy.
Jesus, I think he broke his hip.

10
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:18,629
Shit!

11
00:01:21,080 --> 00:01:23,230
Fuck. He's got a lot of bite
left in him.

12
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,396
Bull pit is not playing with you.

13
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,159
- No shit.
- Come. You want police coming?

14
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:31,989
They used him like a fucking ashtray.
Bunch of assholes.

15
00:01:32,120 --> 00:01:34,111
- Let's get him in the trunk.
- What?

16
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,232
There's an emergency vet just here.
I like this guy.

17
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,194
He tries to bite your face off.
He is meat.

18
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:43,311
You want dog, I buy you nice puppy...

19
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:45,635
Why the fuck do I want a puppy,
Kostya?

20
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,796
Where you go, Monty? Wait.

21
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,476
I not go near bull pit, Monty.

22
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,478
- This is disgusting.
- I told you. It's not a pit bull.

23
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,593
He's a good dog. A tough bastard.
He wasn't lying down for anybody.

24
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,838
- Sometimes you very stupid man.
- If we wait longer he'll be dead.

25
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,473
You wanted to shoot him.

26
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,876
That was a mercy thing. He's not
ready to go. He wants to live.

27
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,638
He tell you this?

28
00:02:09,760 --> 00:02:12,991
It's like a baby, OK? They don't
bitch and scream like that.

29
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,271
They see the doctor
coming with the needle...

30
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,949
- It's good for them in the long run.
- You have no baby.

31
00:02:21,400 --> 00:02:23,914
I can't even talk to you, Kostya.

32
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,039
C'mon, you son of a bitch.

33
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:32,152
Quit standing there.
Fucking help me out here.

34
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,635
Distract him for me or something.

35
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,233
Go on.

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:51,237
I'm trying to help you,
you little prick!

37
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:56,555
Come on. Quien es mas macho?

38
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:59,831
- Monty es mas macho.
- What gives in your little head?

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:03,270
Little of the tricks, the quicks.
Boom, bam, he's nabbed!

40
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:06,358
Little tricks, quicks.
You are bleeding. Bites.

41
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,357
Dog's blood.

42
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,914
Learn to relax a little.
Live a little.

43
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,554
You have hole in neck
and blood is coming out.

44
00:03:14,240 --> 00:03:16,708
A little love bite
for saving his raggedy ass.

45
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,230
Rule number one.
You cannot grab half-dead animals.

46
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:22,078
We have people waiting for us.

47
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,192
People with money.
You want to play this cowboy.

48
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,197
No, dogboy, in middle of highway.

49
00:03:27,320 --> 00:03:30,357
Dogboy? Funny, Kostya.
You mastered the language.

50
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,789
You're bad luck.
You bring bad luck on me.

51
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,879
Everything that can go wrong
go wrong. It's not you and me now.

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,036
- It's you and me and Doyle.
- Doyle?

53
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,594
- Doyle. Doyle's Law.
- It's Murphy.

54
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:42,709
Who is Murphy?

55
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,958
Who's Doyle? It's Murphy's Law.
Whatever can go wrong will go wrong.

56
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:49,071
- Him, yes.
- Yes, him.

57
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,470
What's up there, Monty?
Hey, Doyle.

58
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,633
Easy, Doyle. Easy.

59
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,432
Easy. What do you want, Simon?

60
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,872
I'm hungry.
I woke up an hour ago, I was hungry.

61
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,036
So? Go up to 110th Street.

62
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:05,233
110th Street? C'mon, man!
I can't go up there.

63
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,157
Put that away.

64
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,351
I'm not looking for a mercy pop
or anything.

65
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:13,629
I'm done, Simon.

66
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:18,038
This morning, I was shaving.
I cut myself, look, four times, man.

67
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:20,151
C'mon, Monty, give me a break.

68
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:23,511
I can't go up to Harlem. Look at me.

69
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:26,552
The yo's,
they'll eat me alive up there.

70
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:30,992
I'm out of business, Simon. Take your
jones elsewhere. Leave me be.

71
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,680
Are you afraid
that I'm going to nark you out?

72
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:34,949
You know who I am.

73
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:38,356
You're not listening. I got touched.

74
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:41,074
OK? I'm over. Game over.

75
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:43,191
Five years I've been coming to you.

76
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,151
- Five years.
- Get out of here.

77
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,032
Get the fuck out of here.

78
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,276
Fine. I'm leaving.

79
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,994
No need to get all nasty about it.

80
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,588
But I'll remember this.

81
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,917
Alright? I'll remember this.

82
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:14,431
- What's his name?
- Doyle.

83
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:16,118
Hi, Doyle.

84
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:08,518
Excuse me, sir.
Can I help you? Hello?

85
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,595
- Hello?
- Sorry, what?

86
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:18,633
- Do you have an appointment?
- No, no. I used to go here.

87
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,354
I have to ask you to leave.
And take the dog.

88
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,391
Yeah, OK. We'll just be a minute.

89
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:26,796
- No dogs on the school grounds.
- OK. I understand.

90
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,990
Check this out. He's alright.

91
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,956
Look what a little punk I was.

92
00:11:35,520 --> 00:11:39,149
- In the middle with the ball.
- I guess you weren't the centre.

93
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:42,192
No. No. I started, though.

94
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,595
Freshman year. Varsity, point-guard.

95
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,950
- Yeah?
- I still hold the assist record.

96
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,719
No. Marvin Ray
broke the record last year.

97
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:52,035
- He did not.
- He did, too.

98
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:55,791
- Are you sure?
- Positive. I coach the girls' team.

99
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,158
Well, we were undefeated that year.

100
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,316
Then I got kicked out for fighting.

101
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:08,431
- It all fell apart.
- Too bad.

102
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:11,597
Listen, you know
where Jacob Elinsky is?

103
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,029
He's an old friend of mine.

104
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,912
"Now let us sport us while we may

105
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,600
And now,
like am'rous birds of prey,

106
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,790
Rather at once our time devour,

107
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:25,480
Than languish
in his slow-chapp'd power."

108
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,036
"Let us roll all our strength, and
all our sweetness, up into one ball;

109
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,230
And tear our pleasures
with rough strife

110
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:33,396
Through the iron gates of life."

111
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,318
"Thus, though we cannot make
our sun stand still,

112
00:12:36,440 --> 00:12:38,396
yet we will make him run."

113
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,713
Good.

114
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,234
That's good. An excellent reading.

115
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,715
What do people think?

116
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,512
What's going on here?

117
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:02,151
- Luke?
- Can I go to the bathroom?

118
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:06,831
- No. You went 20 minutes ago.
- I have a bladder infection.

119
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,029
The poem.

120
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:13,113
To His Coy Mistress.

121
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:14,878
Andrew Marvell.

122
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,956
It's not real deep or anything.

123
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,914
The guy wants to get laid
and he's telling her to give it up.

124
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,476
Excuse me. One minute?

125
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,956
- What's going on?
- Who's that?

126
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:34,399
Look who's here.

127
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:39,075
Sorry to drop in on you.
Just want to talk to you a second.

128
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,918
What's going on?

129
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:44,077
- What is this, going on here?
- Teaching my class.

130
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,031
- In a circle like that?
- Yeah.

131
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:50,073
That's cool. I like that. Class.

132
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,637
Sorry to interrupt.
Little change of plans.

133
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:57,873
I gotta see my father tonight.
There's these people.

134
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,278
They're throwing me
kind of a... going-away party.

135
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:05,472
So maybe you
and Frank could meet up somewhere,

136
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,956
maybe that place with the... things
that Frank goes to.

137
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,196
- I'll find you later.
- OK.

138
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,880
- Yeah?
- Of course.

139
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,149
She's cute, with the red shirt.
I think she's giving me the eye.

140
00:14:19,280 --> 00:14:22,989
- How do you do it? I don't know how.
- See you later.

141
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,031
Maybe, like, midnight, I think.

142
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:28,516
- Midnight? Midnight's OK.
- Yeah? Alright.

143
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:31,632
Come on, Doyle. Have a nice day.

144
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,110
Sorry about that.

145
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:00,870
Oh, Christ.

146
00:15:22,520 --> 00:15:23,999
Do you have a minute?

147
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:29,478
Sure. Yeah, come on in.

148
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:34,309
I thought that no students were
allowed in the teachers' lounge.

149
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:36,396
I won't squeal on you.

150
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:41,435
Yeah. Take a seat.

151
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,594
What can I do for you?

152
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,837
- Why did my paper get B-minus?
- It's what you earned.

153
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,633
No one else in the class can write.
We all know it.

154
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,399
Forget them.
You're not competing with them.

155
00:15:58,520 --> 00:16:02,195
But I am. OK? I am competing with
them. When I apply to colleges,

156
00:16:02,320 --> 00:16:04,629
they look at these things
called grades.

157
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:07,957
- If they're not good enough...
- Your grades will be fine.

158
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:11,038
Vincent Miskella writes about
his grandmother dying

159
00:16:11,160 --> 00:16:15,153
and you give him an A-plus.
Meanwhile, the night of the funeral,

160
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:17,271
know where Rhodes scholar Vince is?

161
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:21,075
Getting smashed at a basketball party
and slapping girls' asses.

162
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:24,192
What is that?
A charity A-plus?

163
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,392
Everyone always writes about
their grandmother dying.

164
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:30,273
You know why?
Not because it's so traumatic,

165
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,436
because it's a guaranteed A-plus.

166
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:36,314
And you're all sentimental.
"Very powerful, very moving."

167
00:16:36,440 --> 00:16:38,078
No, it wasn't.

168
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,350
You didn't care. I didn't care.

169
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,472
Nobody cared. That's what
grandmothers do, they die.

170
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:48,230
Sometimes... guys have a hard time
showing their emotions.

171
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:54,196
So, slapping my ass, that's his way
of mourning his grandmother?

172
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,232
What did your mother say
when you got that?

173
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,271
When I got what?

174
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,435
The...

175
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,719
Yeah.

176
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,115
She said,

177
00:17:07,240 --> 00:17:09,549
"Where did you get
the money for that?"

178
00:17:09,680 --> 00:17:12,911
- And?
- And what did I say or...

179
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,872
...where did I get the money?

180
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:18,673
- What did you say?
- I said he likes me.

181
00:17:18,800 --> 00:17:21,792
Does he?

182
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:26,675
No. Why do you care so much?

183
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:28,791
Just curious.

184
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:30,069
So, ...

185
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:34,555
...you're not gonna change the grade?

186
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,875
No. I'm not gonna
change the grade.

187
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,275
Great.
This was a big waste of time.

188
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:40,833
Hold on.

189
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:06,996
Slaughtery. I can't talk.
Employment number's due.

190
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:08,678
- I just...
- Call you later.

191
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm supposed to meet you at Mont...

192
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,950
Frank. Coming out with us tonight?

193
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,993
- Nah, gotta meet some friends.
- Big date? Can I bang her first?

194
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,588
You wish.
Nah, it's a going-away party.

195
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:31,632
Listen. You still holding
those OEX contracts?

196
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,318
Believe it. Why? Nervous?

197
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,796
Claims numbers are dropping.
I'm not comfortable with it.

198
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:39,673
Claims drop,
so employment must go up? C'mon!

199
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,597
Frank, look at me.

200
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:44,553
Everybody thinks this
cos it's nearly always true.

201
00:18:44,680 --> 00:18:47,353
When it rains, people get wet.
Right or wrong?

202
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,994
Not this time. I got a theory. Look.

203
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,997
Good. You've got a theory!

204
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:54,350
Look, Frank.
Fuck you and your theory.

205
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:56,038
- Good. Nice.
- We're in deep.

206
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:59,038
- You've got 60 million dollars...
- A hundred.

207
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:01,875
A hundred fucking million?

208
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:06,278
What are you two doin'? You wanna
join the unemployed? Back to work.

209
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,709
Sal, you knew.
They raised my limit to 100.

210
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,796
A week ago.
They raised it a week ago.

211
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:15,311
- What, you want me to sit on it?
- First, don't raise your voice.

212
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:18,034
You cannot put me, you
or this firm in jeopardy

213
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:21,197
by putting $100 million on one idea!
Right or wrong?

214
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,719
- C'mon!
- Yeah.

215
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,755
Listen. I think we're in for
a low number, alright? 140, 135.

216
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,872
Who gives a shit what you think?
You're being a cowboy.

217
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,036
You come in, you don't even shave.

218
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,390
Stop playing with this and listen.

219
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,829
You come here
drinking your Red Bullshit,

220
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:40,997
you stink of booze, out all night
partying, that's OK.

221
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,680
But when you become a cowboy,
I draw the line.

222
00:19:43,800 --> 00:19:48,237
I am still your boss and I am telling
you, sell half those contracts.

223
00:19:48,360 --> 00:19:50,999
Is that clear?
Do I make myself clear, Frank?

224
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:53,315
- Do I make myself clear to you?
- Yeah.

225
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:56,193
Yes? Good. Have a good day.

226
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,029
And by the way, we're still on for
Friday. Courtside. Don't be late.

227
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,754
It's mayhem at the Ex change,

228
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:05,599
awaiting the unemployment number.

229
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:08,075
Salomon Brothers,
along with most others,

230
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:11,476
feel the number will be high,
around 250, 000...

231
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:16,833
Sallie's looking for a high number.
280,000's their call.

232
00:20:16,960 --> 00:20:19,952
- Fuck Salomon Brothers.
- Fuck Salomon Brothers?

233
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:22,116
Yeah. They're hedging their bets,

234
00:20:22,240 --> 00:20:24,071
want everybody on their side.

235
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,670
What's the big deal with
the employment number, anyway?

236
00:20:27,800 --> 00:20:31,918
Look, more jobs, fewer people hunting
work, harder to find good people.

237
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:35,828
You gotta raise wages to get them.
Means inflation goes up. Got it?

238
00:20:35,960 --> 00:20:37,552
- Yeah.
- I didn't think so.

239
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:41,559
That's why I do this and you
hand out junk mail. Get off my desk.

240
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:45,673
- A striped shirt and a striped tie?
- Yeah, it's for the ladies...

241
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:49,554
Do the ladies ever say you look
like a fucking optical illusion?

242
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:52,638
- Go away. Disappear. Come on.
- I'm out of here.

243
00:20:55,400 --> 00:20:57,470
Better hop to, sonny boy.

244
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,672
You're not picking up
the phone to sell those contracts.

245
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:03,553
Didn't your daddy just
cut off your allowance?

246
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:07,514
I'm a little surprised. You're not
going to disobey a direct order?

247
00:21:07,640 --> 00:21:12,031
Marcuse, do I come into your bedroom,
tell you how to blow your boyfriend?

248
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:13,434
No. Go away.

249
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,278
- Hey, Schultz!
- Yo?

250
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:19,188
- What you got on unemployment?
- 250, 270, somewhere in there.

251
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,072
Big number!

252
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:23,432
Frank. We alright?

253
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,754
We're good.

254
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:30,314
So who really knows...?

255
00:21:30,440 --> 00:21:33,079
The number's coming out...

256
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:37,269
Get me out, now!

257
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:43,159
We're goin' for a ride now!

258
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:12,394
Where've you been?
I got up at seven this morning.

259
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:15,273
- You were already gone.
- Yeah, I just...

260
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:19,239
I needed to walk around, you know?

261
00:22:30,280 --> 00:22:33,590
- How long you been on the stoop?
- All day.

262
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:36,915
I've been waiting for you.

263
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,156
- It's a beautiful day.
- Yeah, I guess it is.

264
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,158
Mr Doyle.
I missed you this morning.

265
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,075
Montgomery, I want you to talk to me.

266
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:06,397
- About what, Nat?
- How you're feeling.

267
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,080
How do you think I'm feeling?

268
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,997
I don't like to assume.

269
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,998
- Well, good. Don't.
- What do you want?

270
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,873
I want to be like that girl in
the X-Men, who walks through walls.

271
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,393
Go on.

272
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:30,068
If I can't do that, I don't know,
boom, one shot to the head.

273
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,713
Problem solved.

274
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:40,669
- Don't joke about that.
- Who says I'm joking?

275
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:08,037
What are we doing tonight?
Before you kill yourself.

276
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:11,550
Uncle Nikolai's throwing me
a party down at Bridge.

277
00:24:11,680 --> 00:24:14,148
Figured we'd all head down there.

278
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,718
Come on. I have to go.
I got no choice.

279
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,512
Might as well try to have fun.

280
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:26,111
- Isn't it over with those guys?
- Yeah, it's almost over.

281
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:28,959
It's never really over
with these guys, but...

282
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:42,714
That's a nasty habit you have,
you know that?

283
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,911
Come take a bath with me.

284
00:25:01,480 --> 00:25:03,755
No, not right now.

285
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:13,271
Go on. Go ahead.

286
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:28,956
You can't see me being a father?

287
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:31,833
No. I can see you
fathering children.

288
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:35,714
- I couldn't see you raising any.
- I won't raise my own "chalupas"?

289
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,751
I'll raise my own chalupas.

290
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:41,475
We're definitely not having kids
if you call them chalupas.

291
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:44,068
I think we would have very, ...

292
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,236
...very beautiful babies.

293
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:59,237
- Show me that.
- What? No, no, no.

294
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:03,433
I can't believe you did that.
I can't believe... Why?

295
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,790
You've lived in the States
all your life.

296
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:08,480
You've been to Puerto Rico twice,
on vacation.

297
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,352
I'm very proud of my heritage.

298
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,357
Yeah, but... What does that mean?

299
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,552
What, so I should get
an Irish flag tattooed on my ass?

300
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:19,514
There's not enough room
on your skinny white flat ass.

301
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:23,030
Well, between you and me,
the kids should be just about right.

302
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:25,594
Kids? We're not having any.

303
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,869
It's probably your mother.

304
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,918
Coming!

305
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,789
Doyle, cut it out.

306
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,960
Kostya, you have
the worst timing ever...

307
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:51,119
Sorry to bother you, ma'am.
Is Montgomery Brogan in?

308
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:59,079
Monty?

309
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:01,553
Monty!

310
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:08,630
- Montgomery Brogan?
- Yeah, that's me.

311
00:27:08,760 --> 00:27:12,196
- Agent Flood, Drug Enforcement.
- I can see that. What is this?

312
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:15,471
We've got a warrant
to search your apartment.

313
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:21,635
Are you serious? Go ahead.

314
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:32,674
- Easy, Doyle.
- I see no tags on that dog.

315
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:36,315
- Inside he doesn't need tags.
- I could have the pound take him.

316
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,432
Seen too many men
bit by these mean bastards.

317
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:43,434
Doyle! C'mon.

318
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,075
Sit.

319
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,037
You mind if I have a seat?

320
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,513
No. Be my guest.

321
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,835
Ms Riviera?
That's your name, right?

322
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:07,590
I need you to stay right here, ma'am.
Can't have you sneaking around.

323
00:28:11,080 --> 00:28:12,991
This sofa's not very comfortable.

324
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:16,999
Maybe it's your posture.
Posture's very important.

325
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:21,432
No, it's this Castro convertible.

326
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:25,872
It's very uncomfortable.
It's kinda lumpy.

327
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:31,278
I just don't understand it.
It looks like such a nice sofa.

328
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,358
How much did you pay
for this sofa, Ms Riviera?

329
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:42,798
- Maybe it's the padding.
- Yeah. Could be the padding.

330
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:44,672
Yeah.

331
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,360
Probably the padding.

332
00:28:54,520 --> 00:28:56,112
Go on, get it over with.

333
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:08,752
There's something lumpy
in here, Mr Brogan.

334
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,675
It's a good thing I found this.

335
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:19,596
It's gonna make your sofa
so much more comfortable to sit on.

336
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:25,754
Shit.

337
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,757
Mr Brogan,
I do believe you're fucked.

338
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:31,313
Royally.

339
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:36,230
Shit.

340
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:49,193
Baby?

341
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:54,231
Are you OK?

342
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:57,272
Yeah. This'll be
the best night of my life.

343
00:29:58,800 --> 00:29:59,949
Best night of my life.

344
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:02,355
I just... I've been waiting all day.

345
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:05,950
- I know. I know! I know...
- Do we get any time together?

346
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:11,074
Could you just talk to me?
We haven't been talking.

347
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:14,510
- This is our last night.
- No. It's not our last night.

348
00:30:15,680 --> 00:30:18,240
My last night. Not your last night.

349
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:20,430
You got all kinds of nights.

350
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:25,190
You got nights with your girlfriends.
Going out clubbing.

351
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,675
- Sitting at bars...
- You and me equals our.

352
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:30,758
- Our last night.
- Sit at home watching movies.

353
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:33,633
- All kinds of nights.
- What can't you understand?

354
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,593
Know what? I can't do this
right now. OK, babe?

355
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,871
I need you to just be quiet.
Please just be quiet.

356
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,754
We haven't talked about this.
You can't even look me in the eye.

357
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:46,235
I have to go. Meet us in Chinatown.

358
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:49,477
- Where are you going?
- I have to see my father.

359
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:57,158
Do me a favour. Wear
that silver dress tonight. OK?

360
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:04,070
- You want me to?
- Yeah.

361
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,988
That's how I want to remember you.

362
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:24,070
Very nice, very nice.

363
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,589
Hello, beautiful lady.

364
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,597
Beautiful baby.

365
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:32,030
You look like Halle Berry,
they tell you this? Come back.

366
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,628
I make you
half-black, half-Russian baby.

367
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:40,033
So many beautiful woman.
I love this area.

368
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:42,833
- How much is rent?
- You can't afford it. Trust me.

369
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:45,838
- What're you doing here?
- Something is wrong?

370
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:49,396
No. I'm having the time of my life.
What do you think, dumb shit?

371
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:51,750
Uncle Nikolai wants me
talking with you.

372
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,269
Make sure
you come to club tonight.

373
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,356
You're the third person to say that.

374
00:31:56,480 --> 00:31:58,357
What the fuck is going on?

375
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:00,436
- What does he want?
- I don't know.

376
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:03,120
You come to say you don't know?
You got a phone.

377
00:32:03,240 --> 00:32:04,673
You do not answer my calls.

378
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:08,998
- Uncle wants you at the Bridge.
- I'll be there. Christ's sake!

379
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:12,831
Tell him. I'm bringing friends.
I'm bringing Naturelle.

380
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,509
Monty. Wait. Please.
Why you bring her?

381
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:19,916
- Why wouldn't I?
- We discussed this before, no?

382
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:23,711
- You get very mad at me.
- Will you stop with that already?

383
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:26,274
I already told you. It wasn't her.

384
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,633
- You know this?
- Why would she?

385
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,512
Maybe her aunt is illegal alien.

386
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,995
- These Mexicans...!
- She's Puerto Rican.

387
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:36,918
A US citizen.
That's more than I can say for you.

388
00:32:37,040 --> 00:32:38,598
The Feds, they bust her...

389
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:42,156
Feds? Why are you filling my head
with this shit? You're crazy.

390
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:43,599
You ask her?

391
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,192
No, I didn't ask her.

392
00:32:49,840 --> 00:32:51,239
Listen.

393
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,592
Before you leave, you should know.

394
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,711
See you down there.

395
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:28,672
Those guys coming back in yet?

396
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:31,872
Little by little.
It was hard on those guys.

397
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,356
I went to elementary school
with that guy Nick. Remember?

398
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:40,190
- Nicky?
- Nick. Yeah, yeah. Good kid.

399
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,993
Place looks good, though.

400
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,678
Wanna take your coat off?

401
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:47,909
Nah, I'm feeling a little cold.

402
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:56,828
- That's a helluva steak.
- Only the best for you, sweetie.

403
00:33:56,960 --> 00:34:00,111
I'll send you cookies every month.
Peanut butter, right?

404
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,673
That's it.

405
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,879
I talked to Sal.

406
00:34:07,000 --> 00:34:09,389
- Dad...
- See if he can help.

407
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,272
He's been out of it for 20 years.

408
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:13,630
- He knows people.
- That's not the point.

409
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:15,830
I don't want you to get involved.

410
00:34:15,960 --> 00:34:19,794
OK? I mean it.
I'm gonna be alright.

411
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,074
You'll still be a young man
when you get out.

412
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:26,556
I know you don't think about it
but don't start any trouble...

413
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,750
Don't worry about me. Please.

414
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:33,750
Should never have happened.
You wanted money,

415
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,599
you could've done anything.
Doctor, lawyer.

416
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,837
- That's all I'm saying.
- Don't lay that on me.

417
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:42,679
When Sal's crew were
squeezing you for payments,

418
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,791
did you wish
I was at law school then?

419
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:47,275
Not one word from you back then.

420
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:50,710
Where d'you think that money
was coming from? Donald Trump?

421
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,956
- That was a mistake.
- Let's forget it.

422
00:34:53,080 --> 00:34:56,834
There were lots of mistakes.
I was drinking after your mom passed.

423
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,951
Please. Please, don't do this.

424
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:02,834
An 11 -year-old boy with
a dead mother and a drunk father.

425
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,111
- I got no one to blame but myself.
- Stop. Stop.

426
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,753
It wasn't you, Pop.

427
00:35:14,160 --> 00:35:16,310
Gotta take a leak.

428
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,515
Yeah, fuck you, too.
Fuck me? Fuck you.

429
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,712
Fuck you and this whole city
and everyone in it.

430
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,795
No, no, no.

431
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:42,229
Fuck the panhandlers
grubbing for money,

432
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,476
smiling at me behind my back.

433
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,070
Fuck the squeegee men,
dirtying the windshield of my car.

434
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,428
Get a fucking job!

435
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,516
Fuck the Sikhs and Pakistanis,

436
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:54,359
bombing down the avenues
in decrepit cabs,

437
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,631
curry steaming outta their pores,
stinking up my day.

438
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,957
Terrorists in fucking training.
Slow the fuck down!

439
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:04,152
...one of those operations
to elongate your penis...

440
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:05,759
Fuck the Chelsea boys

441
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:08,713
with their waxed chests
and pumped-up biceps.

442
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,912
Going down on each other
in my parks and on my piers,

443
00:36:12,040 --> 00:36:14,838
jiggling their dicks
on my channel 35!

444
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,430
Fuck the Korean grocers,
their pyramids overpriced fruit,

445
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:20,869
their roses wrapped in plastic.

446
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,389
Ten years
and still no speak-ee English.

447
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,431
Fuck the Russians
in Brighton Beach.

448
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,519
Mobster thugs sitting in cafes,
sipping tea in little glasses.

449
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:32,074
Sugar cubes between their teeth.

450
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:35,431
Wheeling, dealing, scheming.
Go back where you came from!

451
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,516
Fuck the black-hatted Hasidim,

452
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:42,475
strolling down 47th Street in their
dirty gabardine with their dandruff,

453
00:36:42,600 --> 00:36:44,989
selling South African
apartheid diamonds.

454
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:46,951
Your wife deserves this.

455
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,991
Fuck the Wall Street brokers,

456
00:36:49,120 --> 00:36:51,554
self-styled
masters of the universe,

457
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:54,911
Michael Douglas, Gordon Gecko
wannabe motherfuckers

458
00:36:55,040 --> 00:36:58,350
figuring out new ways
to rob hard-working people blind.

459
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:02,792
Send those Enron assholes
to jail for fucking life.

460
00:37:02,920 --> 00:37:06,959
Bush and Cheney didn't know about
that shit? Give me a fucking break!

461
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:10,436
Tyco. ImCIone. Adelphia.

462
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,790
Fuck the Puerto Ricans, 20 to a car,

463
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:16,515
swelling up the welfare rolls.
Worst fucking parade in the city.

464
00:37:16,640 --> 00:37:19,234
Don't get me started
on the dumb-in-the-cans

465
00:37:19,360 --> 00:37:21,430
who make the Puerto Ricans
look good.

466
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,710
Who's this guy?
Get the fuck outta here!

467
00:37:23,840 --> 00:37:26,638
Fuck the Bensonhurst Italians.
Pomaded hair,

00:37:26,760 --> 00:37:29,718
nylon warm-up suits,
their St Anthony medallions.

469
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:33,628
Swinging their Jason Giambi
Louisville Slugger baseball bats,

470
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,751
auditioning for "The Sopranos"!

471
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:37,757
Fucking crack your head open!

472
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:40,030

00:37:40,160 --> 00:37:43,630
Fuck the Upper East Side wives
with their Hermes scarves,

474
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,671
and $50 Balducci artichokes.

475
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:51,033
Overfed faces getting pulled, lifted
and stretched all taut and shiny.

476
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:53,720
You're not fooling anybody,
sweetheart!

477
00:37:53,840 --> 00:37:56,912
- Taxi!
- Fuck the uptown brothers.

478
00:37:57,040 --> 00:37:59,873
They never pass the ball,
never wanna play defence,

479
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,833
they take five steps
on every lay-up to the hoop,

480
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,713
then they wanna blame it all
on the white man.

481
00:38:05,840 --> 00:38:08,035
We're not giving it up.

482
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:13,996
Slavery ended 137 years ago.
Move the fuck on!

483
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:17,476
Fuck the corrupt cops
with their anus-violating plungers

484
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:21,513
and their 41 shots, standing behind
a blue wall of silence.

485
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,232
You betray our trust!

486
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:27,239
Fuck priests who put their hands
down an innocent child's pants.

487
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:30,477
Fuck the church that protects them,
delivering us into evil.

488
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:33,910
And while you're at it, fuck JC!
He got off easy.

489
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,429
A day on the cross,
a weekend in hell

490
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:39,597
and the hallelujahs
of legioned angels for eternity.

491
00:38:39,720 --> 00:38:42,439
Try seven years
in fucking Otisville, J.

492
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,915
Fuck Osama Bin Laden,
Al-Qaeda,

493
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:49,158
backward-assed cave-dwelling
fundamentalist assholes everywhere.

494
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,840
On the names
of innocent thousands murdered,

495
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,509
I pray you spend the rest
of eternity with your 72 whores

496
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:57,870
roasting in a jet-fuelled fire
in hell.

497
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,949
You towel-headed camel jockeys
can kiss my royal Irish ass!

498
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:05,196
"I notice how many
of what I once thought

499
00:39:05,320 --> 00:39:07,231
were evidences of repression...

500
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:09,920
- Fuck Jacob Elinsky.
- ...sexual or otherwise."

501
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:14,158
Whining malcontent. Fuck Francis
Xavier Slaughtery, my best friend,

502
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:16,874
judging me while he stares
at my girl's ass.

503
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:19,195
Fuck Naturelle Riviera.

504
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:22,869
I gave her my trust
and she stabbed me in the back.

505
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,958
Sold me up the river. Fucking bitch.

506
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,514
Fuck my father
with his endless grief,

507
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:31,837
standing behind that bar,
sipping on club soda,

508
00:39:31,960 --> 00:39:36,351
selling whiskey to firemen
and cheering the Bronx Bombers.

509
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,119
Let's go, Yankees!

510
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,196
Fuck this city and everyone in it.

511
00:39:41,320 --> 00:39:44,835
From the rowhouses of Astoria
to the penthouses on Park Avenue.

512
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:47,918
From the projects in the Bronx
to the lofts in SoHo.

513
00:39:48,040 --> 00:39:51,589
The tenements in Alphabet City
to the brownstones in Park Slope,

514
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:55,998
to the split-levels in Staten Island.
Let an earthquake crumble it.

515
00:39:56,120 --> 00:39:58,873
Let the fires rage.
Let it burn to fucking ash.

516
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,479
Then let the waters rise

517
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:04,388
and submerge this whole
rat-infested place.

518
00:40:08,520 --> 00:40:10,192
No...

519
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:14,032
No, fuck you, Montgomery Brogan.

520
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,438
You had it all and you threw it away,
you dumb fuck!

521
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:28,798
What do you think of Naturelle?

522
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,434
A good girl.
Your mother would've liked her.

523
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,755
- You trust her?
- Do I trust her?

524
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:35,836
- Why do I have to?
- You think I can?

525
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,996
- Where are you taking this?
- I dunno.

526
00:40:38,120 --> 00:40:41,908
People are saying weird things.
I'm hearing stuff around.

527
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,508
Like, maybe she made
the phone call on me.

528
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:47,791
- Why would she do that?
- Maybe they got to her.

529
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,354
They find someone,
put the screws on you...

530
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,755
She loves you.
She'd never betray you.

531
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:57,635
I don't know. I don't know.
Everything's gotten so strange.

532
00:40:57,760 --> 00:40:59,751
I look at these people around me.

533
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,030
I'm thinking, these are my friends?

534
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,551
I don't even know these people.
And Naturelle, even.

535
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:09,433
Do I really know her? I don't know.

536
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,312
It's all...

537
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:14,876
The only people I trust
are you, Jacob and Frank.

538
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:17,468
- The guys I grew up with.
- I miss those boys.

539
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,511
I know.

540
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:22,837
I'm meant to be meeting them.
They're waiting for me.

541
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,269
- I gotta get going.
- What about your food?

542
00:41:25,400 --> 00:41:29,951
- I can't.
- OK. I'll see you in the morning.

543
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:32,548
No. No, why?
I'm taking the bus up.

544
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:35,513
Forget the bus. I'll drive you.
Take half as long.

545
00:41:37,600 --> 00:41:40,114
Take... this.

546
00:41:41,120 --> 00:41:42,792
They'll let you keep it.

547
00:41:42,920 --> 00:41:45,912
When you was a kid, you slept
in that fireman's helmet.

548
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,951
You wanted to be just like Daddy.

549
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:50,594
I tell you about the fights
we had, naming you?

550
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:52,278
You wanted to name me James.

551
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,630
James Brogan Junior.
Good strong name.

552
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:58,230
- Your mother said it was boring.
- She liked Montgomery Clift.

553
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,271
A Place in the Sun.
Her favourite.

554
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:03,676
I'd say, "Clift, look what happened
to that poor fuck."

555
00:42:03,800 --> 00:42:05,392
Died way too young. Bad luck.

556
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,279
Bad luck.

557
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:12,518
I'm gonna go. OK?

558
00:42:13,840 --> 00:42:15,796
See you soon, Pop.

559
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:22,912
Monty...

560
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:38,675
He'll work for me.
I'll have his job.

561
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,754
I gotta go. Talk to you tomorrow.

562
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:44,237
Cocksucker.

563
00:42:46,400 --> 00:42:48,311
How you doing?

564
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,635
- Good to see you.
- How you doing?

565
00:42:50,760 --> 00:42:53,479
- Good.
- Come on in.

566
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:56,794
- Want a beer?
- Yeah.

567
00:42:56,920 --> 00:42:57,875
Cool.

568
00:43:10,000 --> 00:43:12,036
There you go. Cheers.

569
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,715
Jesus Christ!

570
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,796
Yeah.

571
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:39,714
New York Times says
the air's bad down here.

572
00:43:39,840 --> 00:43:42,149
Yeah? Fuck the Times.

573
00:43:42,280 --> 00:43:44,157
I read the Post.

574
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:47,797
EP A says it's fine.

575
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:51,236
Somebody's lying.

576
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:55,679
Yeah.

577
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:59,274
- You gonna move?
- Fuck that, man!

578
00:43:59,400 --> 00:44:01,789
As much good money
as I paid for this place?

579
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:03,876
Hell, no.

580
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:07,754
Bin Laden could drop another
right next door, I ain't moving.

581
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,550
What do we say to him?

582
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:25,957
We say nothing.

583
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:29,675
He's going to hell for seven years.
What do we do, wish him luck?

584
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:32,518
Just get him drunk.

585
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:35,029
Make sure he has
one last good night.

586
00:44:37,600 --> 00:44:41,115
- That's it.
- So you're up for this?

587
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:43,117
Yeah.

588
00:44:44,120 --> 00:44:46,475
I don't know why he invited me.

589
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:48,830
What are you talking about, man?

590
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:51,349
We hardly see each other any more.

591
00:44:52,560 --> 00:44:55,074
You and I
are his friends from the past.

592
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:58,909
Yeah, like his friends from the
present have done him much good!

593
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:05,077
I just... Just can't believe
he's going away for seven years.

594
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,637
- Someone turns him in and...
- Don't feed me that shit!

595
00:45:09,760 --> 00:45:12,877
- What shit?
- Don't feed me that bullshit.

596
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:17,998
Yeah, he got caught. But hello,
Monty's a fucking drug dealer!

597
00:45:18,120 --> 00:45:20,111
Shit.

598
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,993
What, are you driving
a vintage Super B?

599
00:45:23,120 --> 00:45:25,680
- No.
- No. He is.

600
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:28,633
Paid for by the misery
of other people.

601
00:45:29,880 --> 00:45:33,190
He got caught. He'll be locked up.
I tell you something else.

602
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,834
You two are my best friends
in the whole world.

603
00:45:35,960 --> 00:45:38,997
I love him like a brother
but he fucking deserves it.

604
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:42,958
He deserves it.

605
00:45:44,080 --> 00:45:46,435
What's he planning to do with Doyle?

606
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,790
How the fuck should I know?

607
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:55,677
Maybe leave him with Naturelle
or something.

608
00:45:57,120 --> 00:45:59,918
They should at least
let him take Doyle with him.

609
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,315
What?

610
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,908
Let him take Doyle.
He wouldn't be so lonely.

611
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,033
You can't take a fucking dog
to the hoosegow, Jake.

612
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:12,277
I'm just saying,
it'd be kinda nice if you could.

613
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:17,955
Yeah. It'd be nice.

614
00:46:24,920 --> 00:46:27,388
Monty's tough. I think he'll be OK.

615
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:34,068
If it were me, I'd never last
a day. But Monty, he's different.

616
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:36,760
- Yeah? You believe that?
- Yeah.

617
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,952
- You don't fucking get it, do you?
- What don't I get?

618
00:46:40,080 --> 00:46:41,672
You want the simple version?

619
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:45,588
Guys who look like Monty
don't do well in prison, right?

620
00:46:45,720 --> 00:46:48,792
He's got three choices.
None of them are good.

621
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:52,117
One, he can run.
Two, catch the bullet train.

622
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:55,357
- Bullet train?
- It's just what his choices are.

623
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:57,675
His third choice is prison,
that's it.

624
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:01,554
That's what he'll do. He'll go,
I'll see him when he gets out.

625
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,160
Maybe. I'll tell you what.

626
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:11,754
After tonight,
it's bye-bye, Monty.

627
00:47:13,120 --> 00:47:14,997
What does that mean?

628
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:20,157
If he runs, he's gone.
He ain't coming home.

629
00:47:20,280 --> 00:47:23,397
He pulls the trigger,
they close the casket, he's gone.

630
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,229
They lock him away, he's gone.
You'll never see him again.

631
00:47:27,360 --> 00:47:29,351
- I'll see him again.
- You won't.

632
00:47:29,480 --> 00:47:32,233
I'll visit him,
see him when he comes out...

633
00:47:32,360 --> 00:47:35,318
This is such horse-shit.
This is so like you, Jake.

634
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:37,431
- You won't see him.
- Like me?

635
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:40,120
Exactly. You will never
see him again.

636
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:43,550
You think you'll kick back
with some beers, reminisce?

637
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:45,875
Old times, still gonna be friends.

638
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:49,197
It's over after tonight, Jake.
Wake the fuck up.

639
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:50,557
Let her go.

640
00:48:57,160 --> 00:49:00,755
That's a good-looking girl
you got there. Them Spanish broads.

641
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:04,598
That's a scary look.

642
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:08,833
See the look he gave me?

643
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:14,430
Naturelle Riviera.

644
00:49:14,560 --> 00:49:17,438
What a name.
You see the rack on that girl?

645
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:20,798
Take another angle, man.

646
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:25,198
- You can't fucking touch her.
- No, no, no, no.

647
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:27,072
You're missing the point.

648
00:49:27,200 --> 00:49:29,031
- She touched you.
- You're lying.

649
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:30,991
- Am I?
- Yeah.

650
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:34,192
That's sweet. You really trust her.

651
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,197
All I know is she's walking away.

652
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,276
Yeah. We just signed her release.

653
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,188
Probably having a big party tonight
over at Jimmy's Bronx Cafe.

654
00:49:42,320 --> 00:49:43,594
Sure, why not?

655
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:48,874
Big celebration. She's got that whole
fancy apartment to herself now.

656
00:49:49,000 --> 00:49:51,560
You thought she was with you
for your looks?

657
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:54,513
Shi-i-it.

658
00:49:54,640 --> 00:49:57,598
Girl saw a pot of honey
and she licked it clean.

659
00:49:57,720 --> 00:50:02,350
She's a real smart girl.
You, on the other hand...

660
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,357
You're supposed to be smart.

661
00:50:04,480 --> 00:50:08,393
Got yourself a scholarship
to a fancy private school?

662
00:50:08,520 --> 00:50:10,272
Not bad for a punk from Bay Ridge.

663
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,552
Then you get yourself thrown out
for dealing weed to rich kids.

664
00:50:14,680 --> 00:50:15,795
What up with that?

665
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,390
You know what happens to
pretty boys like you in prison?

666
00:50:19,520 --> 00:50:21,112
They're gonna love you.

667
00:50:24,200 --> 00:50:26,077
Yeah, maybe.

668
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:29,872
But then again, ... maybe not.

669
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:32,434
Jeez, Your Honour, what can I say?

670
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:35,757
I messed up.
You know, my mother died.

671
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:39,077
I was so worried about my father,
I needed to help him out.

672
00:50:39,200 --> 00:50:40,428
My head was turned.

673
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:43,916
I got hooked in with the wrong
people and I made a big mistake.

674
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,113
I really did,
but... it was my first time.

675
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:50,708
I'm sorry.
It will never, ever happen again.

676
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,994
Time served. Probation.

677
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:59,112
You don't read the papers much,
do you, smart guy?

678
00:50:59,240 --> 00:51:03,153
In New York, we've got a wonderful
thing called the Rockefeller Laws.

679
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,750
Let me educate you.
You had a kilo in your sofa.

680
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,156
That kind of weight
makes it an A 1 felony.

681
00:51:10,280 --> 00:51:12,999
15 years to life minimum,
first offence.

682
00:51:13,120 --> 00:51:17,238
With that spread in sentencing,
judges get swayed by prosecutors.

683
00:51:17,360 --> 00:51:21,239
If Mr Prosecutor's wife busted his
chops that morning, you're fucked.

684
00:51:21,360 --> 00:51:22,918
You're gone for good.

685
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:25,315
If you get lucky, really lucky,

686
00:51:25,440 --> 00:51:27,590
like, he got good trim
the night before,

687
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:30,359
maybe he'll plead you off to an A2.

688
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:33,040
That's three to eight
for first time. Minimum.

689
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:37,278
How much of that you pull is up to
the mood of the prosecutor.

690
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:41,188
And he's going to ask us,
did he play ball?

691
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:43,478
So, ...

692
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,552
...why don't you tell us
about your friend Nikolai?

693
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:49,796
Let us make it easy on you.

694
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:53,191
Can I ask you one question?

695
00:51:54,120 --> 00:51:55,633
Sure.

696
00:52:00,200 --> 00:52:02,430
When you have your dick
in his mouth,

697
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:04,949
does he just keep talking like that?

698
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,350
Seems to me
he just never shuts up and I'm...

699
00:52:09,480 --> 00:52:11,391
I'm curious. Isn't that annoying?

700
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:14,876
You're fucking a guy in the mouth
and he just won't shut up?

701
00:52:17,800 --> 00:52:20,678
Look here, you vanilla motherfucker,

702
00:52:20,800 --> 00:52:24,110
when you're upstate
taking it in the culo,

703
00:52:24,240 --> 00:52:26,800
by a bunch of guys
calling you Shirley,

704
00:52:26,920 --> 00:52:30,993
you'll only have yourself
and Governor Rockefeller to thank.

705
00:52:31,120 --> 00:52:33,190
Let's get the hell outta here.

706
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:36,838
Tell the US Attorney
we got a hard ass.

707
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:51,072
- You need a girlfriend.
- I need a girlfriend?

708
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,795
Wait a minute. When was
the last time you had a girlfriend?

709
00:52:54,920 --> 00:52:56,751
When did you last get laid?

710
00:52:56,880 --> 00:52:59,838
- I've got prospects.
- Yeah, you got prospects.

711
00:52:59,960 --> 00:53:01,518
You know what?

712
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:04,279
You're in the 62nd percentile,
you are.

713
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:06,960
- What is that?
- The 62nd percentile?

714
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:08,718
That's where you rate.

715
00:53:08,840 --> 00:53:12,674
Bachelors in New York compete for
the same women. Straight bachelors.

716
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,519
- And I'm in the 62nd percentile?
- Yes, sir.

717
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:17,835
So I'm better than
62 percent of them?

718
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,748
- You're rated higher, yeah.
- But worse than what, 38 percent?

719
00:53:21,880 --> 00:53:25,111
- 37. No 100th percentile.
- How d'you come up with 62?

720
00:53:25,240 --> 00:53:27,879
- There's a science to it.
- A science to it?

721
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:32,278
Sounds very scientific.
May I enquire as to your rating?

722
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:36,109
Funny you should ask.
I fall right in the 99 percentile.

723
00:53:36,240 --> 00:53:38,993
Of course.

724
00:53:39,120 --> 00:53:42,430
- Who came up with the ratings?
- I did.

725
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,199
You came up with the ratings?
And you get a 99.

726
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:47,276
- That's very interesting.
- Yeah?

727
00:53:47,400 --> 00:53:48,958
What are these based on?

728
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:52,868
It's a system. That's your rating.
It doesn't make you a bad person.

729
00:53:53,000 --> 00:53:57,039
- No, just a bad bachelor.
- A better-than-average bachelor.

730
00:53:57,160 --> 00:54:00,755
- What are the criteria?
- First, money. You have none.

731
00:54:00,880 --> 00:54:02,791
Trust funds don't count for shit

732
00:54:02,920 --> 00:54:05,832
because Mommy and Daddy
can turn off the cashflow.

733
00:54:05,960 --> 00:54:07,791
That keeps you out of the top ten.

734
00:54:07,920 --> 00:54:10,036
Ten percent of the gold-diggers?

735
00:54:10,160 --> 00:54:12,549
Ten percent period.

736
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:17,913
Two, you got chronic bad breath.
No offence,

737
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:22,033
but most women won't stick with
a guy with stank breath, so...

738
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:24,276
- Fuck you.
- No need to get annoyed.

739
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:28,154
I am annoyed. What puts you in
the 99 percentile? I wanna know.

740
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:30,874
OK. Well, first of all, I...

741
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:35,117
Besides your salary,
all the money you make.

742
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:37,037
Alright.

743
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,152
I happen to be blessed
with a very big dick.

744
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:47,239
Genetics, man.

745
00:54:47,360 --> 00:54:50,079
Doesn't dyeing your hair
drop you a few places?

746
00:54:50,200 --> 00:54:53,670
No. Not at all. Would only
bother women if it bothered me.

747
00:54:53,800 --> 00:54:56,075
- Going grey does bother you.
- Doesn't.

748
00:54:56,200 --> 00:55:00,079
So why smear that gloop over
your scalp ten billion times a day?

749
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,077
Hair's a non-issue, Jake.

750
00:55:02,200 --> 00:55:04,668
Well, are table manners an issue?

751
00:55:04,800 --> 00:55:09,271
That silver thing to the left
of your plate, that's called a fork.

752
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:11,789
People eat rice
with chopsticks or a fork.

753
00:55:11,920 --> 00:55:16,391
Grown people don't eat fried rice
with their bare hands.

754
00:55:17,640 --> 00:55:21,110
- You don't know how to behave.
- You bust my balls over how I eat?

755
00:55:21,240 --> 00:55:25,358
You spend your week figuring how
to defraud foreign governments,

756
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,038
then you get out of there

757
00:55:27,160 --> 00:55:32,473
and go out into the strange world
outside your office, called reality,

758
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,636
and you don't know how to behave.

759
00:55:37,680 --> 00:55:40,797
- I rest my case.
- You wanna tell me about reality?

760
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:44,799
Jacob, you're a rich Jewish kid
ashamed of his wealth.

761
00:55:46,520 --> 00:55:49,239
You walk around unhappy 24/7,

762
00:55:49,360 --> 00:55:51,794
trying to make up
for being born privileged.

763
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,718
Fuck that! You know what?

764
00:55:54,840 --> 00:55:58,037
That's just some knee-jerk
liberalism bullshit, man.

765
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,474
You call that reality?

766
00:56:08,080 --> 00:56:09,957
So what's Monty?

767
00:56:11,840 --> 00:56:13,068
Let's see.

768
00:56:17,280 --> 00:56:22,035
Monty's going to prison.
He's a doughnut. Big fat zero.

769
00:56:23,240 --> 00:56:26,437
Yo. Let's not go to practice.

770
00:56:26,560 --> 00:56:27,709
Just today.

771
00:56:27,840 --> 00:56:30,400
- So don't go.
- Let's go to my house.

772
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:33,080
- Yeah!
- C'mon, Nat. Let's go.

773
00:56:33,200 --> 00:56:37,159
My mother won't be home
till late either. And there's food.

774
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,794
- Good. I ain't got no money.
- Peter's home.

775
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:41,797
- So?
- What's that?

776
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:45,469
- Nothing, I don't care.
- You don't care, Nat?

777
00:56:45,600 --> 00:56:47,830
- What do you mean now?
- Yeah, right!

778
00:56:47,960 --> 00:56:50,952
- You've likeded him forever!
- I never likeded him.

779
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:54,436
You always try to hook us up
cos you want me as a sister-in-law.

780
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,552
That'd be nice, but don't
pretend you don't like him.

781
00:56:57,680 --> 00:56:59,432
Nat, please, OK.

782
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,711
Every day you come to my house.
"Peter, walk me home..."

783
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:05,638
Every day?
What kind of bullshit is that?

784
00:57:06,640 --> 00:57:10,519
- What's up, Simon?
- How you doin'? Good, good.

785
00:57:10,640 --> 00:57:14,394
- What's that?
- A new guy. Golden. He's good.

786
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:17,796
He's big, big. Like, beep-beep!
Back up the truck.

787
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,990
I'll handle my business, alright?

788
00:57:20,120 --> 00:57:22,634
- Just trying to help.
- Alright, take it easy.

789
00:57:22,760 --> 00:57:26,309
- When she break up with him?
- Like, a month ago.

790
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:31,309
But she don't stop. She calls
the house, she hangs up, please...!

791
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:34,955
Did he break up with her
or she broke up with him?

792
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:36,308
Excuse me.

793
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:39,512
- Why doesn't he...?
- Excuse me. You got a light?

794
00:57:39,640 --> 00:57:42,108
Can I borrow your lighter
for a second?

795
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,196
Thanks a lot.

796
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:55,953
- What's he doing?
- He's loco.

797
00:58:00,920 --> 00:58:04,435
- I've met you before, haven't I?
- You are familiar. Where from?

798
00:58:04,560 --> 00:58:07,120
- You were in my brother's class.
- Pete.

799
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:09,872
Yeah, I know who you are.

800
00:58:10,760 --> 00:58:14,070
Nat. Come on, let's go.
We got practice.

801
00:58:14,200 --> 00:58:16,668
- I'll catch up.
- Alright.

802
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:19,633
Whatever. You stupid...

803
00:58:19,760 --> 00:58:22,752
- What you got practice for?
- Basketball.

804
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:25,553
Seriously? You play? Come on!

805
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:27,398
- You a guard?
- Three spot.

806
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:32,640
Small forward? No shit.
That means you're strong and quick.

807
00:58:32,760 --> 00:58:34,990
I play the one. Point.

808
00:58:35,120 --> 00:58:39,159
- Skip practice, you'll get the boot.
- Just wanna finish my cigarette.

809
00:58:39,280 --> 00:58:43,512
Funny, I wouldn't have made you
for a ball player, you know?

810
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:45,468
You look more like a...

811
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:49,798
Like a runner. Like a track star.

812
00:58:49,920 --> 00:58:51,797
Where you from?

813
00:58:53,560 --> 00:58:55,630
No, I mean... You from uptown?

814
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,469
- You on a scholarship?
- What? I can't be from Riverdale?

815
00:58:59,600 --> 00:59:03,513
You can be from wherever you want.
Just... curious.

816
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,958
I didn't mean nothing.
I was on a scholarship, too.

817
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,958
It's a good thing. You're lucky.

818
00:59:12,960 --> 00:59:15,599
What's your name? Nat? Natalie?

819
00:59:15,720 --> 00:59:19,395
- Naturelle.
- Naturelle? You serious?

820
00:59:20,440 --> 00:59:23,113
Naturelle? I like it.

821
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:29,918
- How old are you?
- 18.

822
00:59:30,040 --> 00:59:31,473
Are you 18?

823
00:59:31,600 --> 00:59:33,477
- Why?
- Cos it's not every day

824
00:59:33,600 --> 00:59:36,956
I meet such a pretty girl
who plays three spot. That's deadly.

825
00:59:38,920 --> 00:59:41,354
- How old are you?
- Old enough to have to ask.

826
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:44,392
You're too old to be hanging out
in the playground.

827
00:59:44,520 --> 00:59:47,557
I wasn't hanging out.
I was passing by.

828
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,591
What if I was 17?

829
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:55,594
I might shorten the conversation
a little. But you're not, you're 18.

830
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:57,870
So we got no problem.

831
01:00:05,560 --> 01:00:08,597
What do you say
I come see you play sometime?

832
01:00:09,760 --> 01:00:12,069
Seriously. I'd like to.

833
01:00:14,280 --> 01:00:16,475
- Maybe.
- Maybe?

834
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:22,436
I'll be the one behind the bench
yelling, "Get back on D!"

835
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:25,028
See you.

836
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,593
Hey. I want you to meet somebody.

837
01:00:35,720 --> 01:00:37,278
Who's that?

838
01:00:37,400 --> 01:00:39,709
She's just the girl for you.

839
01:00:46,880 --> 01:00:49,030
Hey, Jody. Are you back there?

840
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,152
- Hey, baby. How you doin'?
- Hi.

841
01:00:52,280 --> 01:00:54,714
Is this your little brother?
He's a cutey.

842
01:00:54,840 --> 01:00:57,354
Don't bother.
I'm in the 62nd percentile.

843
01:00:57,480 --> 01:01:01,189
Cos you don't work on Wall Street.
That scale is skewed on money.

844
01:01:01,320 --> 01:01:05,074
- Everybody knows about this?
- Everybody at this bar.

845
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,034
- Phew... You see that ass?
- She's beautiful.

846
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:14,837
Yeah.

847
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:19,595
One of the guys at school,

848
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:24,236
this biology teacher, Terry...
D'you ever meet Terry?

849
01:01:24,360 --> 01:01:26,555
No, I don't think so.

850
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,074
Anyway, he really likes this girl.

851
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:33,237
- A student?
- A student. Yeah.

852
01:01:33,360 --> 01:01:35,112
A junior.

853
01:01:35,240 --> 01:01:37,117
I mean, the girl's 16.

854
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:39,751
17, maybe. I don't know.

855
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:44,908
I mean, she's not real pretty.
Not in the classical sense.

856
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:47,110
But she...

857
01:01:48,520 --> 01:01:50,954
I don't know. She's got something.

858
01:01:51,880 --> 01:01:53,074
And I told him.

859
01:01:54,320 --> 01:01:57,312
I told Terry
he ought to just forget about it.

860
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:00,955
And he's kind of obsessing.
It's kind of scary.

861
01:02:01,080 --> 01:02:04,390
The way he talks about it.
But he's like, ...

862
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:08,512
..."Five years from now,
she'll almost be out of college,

863
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:11,632
and I'll be 36... You know."

864
01:02:11,760 --> 01:02:14,274
"You know? Nothing wrong with that."

865
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:17,073
You haven't fucked her yet,
have you? Have you?

866
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:21,795
Sorry. Did you listen to what I said?

867
01:02:26,120 --> 01:02:29,157
No, I haven't fucked her. Of course.

868
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:32,511
That's good. Because,
man, big mistake.

869
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,870
I am not a pervert.

870
01:02:35,000 --> 01:02:38,629
Know what a man should never ask
in a Victoria's Secret shop?

871
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:41,718
Does this come in children's sizes?
Think about that.

872
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:46,192
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It's literal. A joke.

873
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,275
Literal?

874
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:49,595
Why do we do this?
Why can't we sit down.

875
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:52,393
You shut the fuck up,
have a beer, a drink...

876
01:02:53,200 --> 01:02:55,077
Francis Xavier Slaughtery.

877
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,679
Hey, baby.

878
01:02:56,800 --> 01:03:00,236
- Hey, Naturelle. Nice to see you.
- You, too.

879
01:03:00,360 --> 01:03:02,954
- Hi.
- How you doing, Jake?

880
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:08,596
- You look fantastic.
- Thank you. What are you up to?

881
01:03:08,720 --> 01:03:12,713
- Frank's eyeing the bartender.
- Yeah? What's the verdict?

882
01:03:12,840 --> 01:03:14,796
Guilty of looking good.

883
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:18,469
- She's just tits, Francis.
- Yeah? Did you see her ass?

884
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:21,353
Girl's got a fine ass
and she's oozing sex appeal.

885
01:03:21,480 --> 01:03:23,471
She's oozing somethin'.

886
01:03:24,160 --> 01:03:27,789
That is so typical.
That's what I'm talking about.

887
01:03:27,920 --> 01:03:30,354
Why is it if a woman walks in
with great tits,

888
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:33,199
every other woman in there
says she's a slut?

889
01:03:33,320 --> 01:03:37,438
- I have great tits. I'm no slut.
- Says you. Another thing...

890
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:40,677
When I call a girl and say,
"Let's meet for dinner,"

891
01:03:40,800 --> 01:03:44,395
why can't I get off the phone
for half an hour? That's a sickness.

892
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,273
And tell me this.
Please explain this to me.

893
01:03:47,400 --> 01:03:51,632
Why is it that women feel the need
to cry after having great sex?

894
01:03:52,280 --> 01:03:55,511
Why is that?
What is up with that?

895
01:03:55,640 --> 01:03:57,437
Oh, my God.

896
01:03:57,560 --> 01:03:59,357
- What?
- Are you serious?

897
01:03:59,480 --> 01:04:02,119
Yes. It's a joy thing, it's not...

898
01:04:02,240 --> 01:04:04,196
Please!

899
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:08,993
You're just a sad fuck, Francis.

900
01:04:09,120 --> 01:04:12,430
Looks like you've been demoted
from the 99th percentile.

901
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:16,712
You should've been here for Jake's
story about his imaginary friend.

902
01:04:19,800 --> 01:04:22,951
- OK.
- So, where's your man?

903
01:04:23,080 --> 01:04:25,071
Like he's ever on time?

904
01:04:25,200 --> 01:04:27,077
Better be tomorrow.

905
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,475
How's his dad doing?

906
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:31,795
Like he's aged 20 years
in a few months.

907
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:34,115
That's too bad.

908
01:04:34,240 --> 01:04:36,231
C'mon, we gotta keep this upbeat.

909
01:04:36,360 --> 01:04:38,316
Make sure he has a good night.

910
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:42,752
Alright. Why don't you give us
some more sex tips to cheer us up?

911
01:04:42,880 --> 01:04:45,678
- Touche.
- Where's the little girls' room?

912
01:04:50,960 --> 01:04:54,236
I know she cries after having sex.
I'd bet money on that shit.

913
01:04:54,360 --> 01:04:56,794
Like to know, wouldn't you?

914
01:04:58,120 --> 01:05:01,351
Set 'em up for the Dead End Kids.

915
01:05:04,200 --> 01:05:06,555
- Been waiting long?
- No. We got here early.

916
01:05:06,680 --> 01:05:08,477
- Naturelle?
- Bathroom.

917
01:05:08,600 --> 01:05:10,431
These are on me.

918
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:12,872
- Cheers.
- Thank you, Jody.

919
01:05:13,000 --> 01:05:14,831
Come by Sunday. It's my birthday.

920
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:19,151
Yeah.

921
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:22,310
Thanks, Jody.

922
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:24,351
You don't have to come.

923
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:27,233
- I was just saying.
- No, thanks. Thank you.

924
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,513
- Fuck Sunday.
- Hey. Fuck Sunday.

925
01:06:21,320 --> 01:06:24,039
The whole city
came out to say goodbye.

926
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,835
- You got a lot of young fans.
- Yeah.

927
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:31,598
I think we're the oldest people here.

928
01:06:31,720 --> 01:06:32,948
We?

929
01:06:42,280 --> 01:06:43,872
This is my guy.

930
01:06:46,480 --> 01:06:49,711
- How you doing, big man?
- It's the man. The man's arrived.

931
01:06:49,840 --> 01:06:51,671
Coming and going.

932
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,916
Seven years. That shit ain't no joke.

933
01:06:54,040 --> 01:06:55,996
- That's nervous!
- That's the word.

934
01:06:56,120 --> 01:06:59,954
- Damn, you alright?
- Trying not to think about it.

935
01:07:00,080 --> 01:07:02,469
What is this?
What's going on here?

936
01:07:02,600 --> 01:07:05,592
That's the legendary DJ Dusk.
My man from Fort Greene.

937
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:09,349
He's nice. 17 years old, man. 17!

938
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:12,278
Gets the girls jumping.
But forget about the crowd.

939
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:13,833
VIP's set up for you.

940
01:07:13,960 --> 01:07:16,190
These are my guys.
Do we come in here?

941
01:07:16,320 --> 01:07:19,357
No, go in through the back.
Door's open for you.

942
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:20,595
Hey, listen up.

943
01:07:20,720 --> 01:07:25,589
Don't lose your temper until it's
time to lose your temper. Hear me?

944
01:07:26,680 --> 01:07:29,797
- Take care.
- Catch you on the other side.

945
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,551
Hey, Elinsky!

946
01:07:38,680 --> 01:07:40,159
Mr Elinsky. My God.

947
01:07:40,280 --> 01:07:43,238
What are you doing?
I didn't know you ever left school.

948
01:07:43,360 --> 01:07:46,830
I thought you had,
like, a bed in the boiler room.

949
01:07:48,200 --> 01:07:49,315
Mary D'Annunzio.

950
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:54,116
Mary B-minus D'Annunzio, that's me.
I'm kidding. It's not a big deal.

951
01:07:54,240 --> 01:07:56,595
That's OK. I'm here with friends.

952
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,871
The guy who came today?
He knows people, right?

953
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:04,471
- D'you think he could get us in?
- No, I don't think...

954
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:07,433
They won't let anyone in.
They say it's too crowded.

955
01:08:07,560 --> 01:08:09,676
But I have to get in. I have to.

956
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:13,713
- Are you a fan of Dusk?
- Yeah, sure.

957
01:08:13,840 --> 01:08:16,593
He's the absolute truth.
He is so truth.

958
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:19,439
I can't believe you're into Dusk.
No offence,

959
01:08:19,560 --> 01:08:23,109
I thought you'd be more into
show tunes or Barry Manilow.

960
01:08:23,240 --> 01:08:25,549
No, I think Dusk is very good.

961
01:08:25,680 --> 01:08:28,114
Actually, I prefer his earlier work.

962
01:08:28,240 --> 01:08:30,595
- Hey, Jake!
- His earlier work?

963
01:08:30,720 --> 01:08:33,678
What're you doin'?

964
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:36,553
C'mon, they're holding the door.
We're together.

965
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,830
You're the man with the dog, right?

966
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:41,918
You again. Yeah.
Isn't it past your bedtime?

967
01:08:42,040 --> 01:08:45,237
- No, I'm with Jake. We're... lovers.
- Lovers?

968
01:08:45,360 --> 01:08:47,191
- She's kidding.
- Really?

969
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:49,231
Come in. Plenty of room for lovers.

970
01:08:49,360 --> 01:08:52,113
- Can my three friends come?
- Girls?

971
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,037
- No.
- Mary. Please.

972
01:08:54,160 --> 01:08:57,277
Are you out of your mind?
You can't take a bunch of guys in.

973
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,551
- She can't go in there.
- No, it's good, it's good.

974
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:02,830
- Monty!
- These two. Yeah.

975
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,315
Y'know, I've seen
pictures of this room.

976
01:09:25,440 --> 01:09:27,476
Like, Daft Punk was in here.

977
01:09:28,720 --> 01:09:31,632
So, who are you?
Are you someone famous?

978
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:34,672
Hey, D'Annunzio.
Give it a rest with the questions.

979
01:09:34,800 --> 01:09:37,633
- Have a little champagne.
- OK.

980
01:09:40,320 --> 01:09:42,197
Who's that?

981
01:09:42,320 --> 01:09:45,676
- One of Jake's students.
- What?

982
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:53,597
Enjoy.

983
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:57,194
Champagne for my real friends,

984
01:09:57,320 --> 01:09:59,197
and real pain for my sham friends.

985
01:09:59,320 --> 01:10:01,436
Cheers.

986
01:10:09,000 --> 01:10:10,831
- Like that?
- Yep.

987
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,030
Does anyone want to go dance?

988
01:10:13,160 --> 01:10:15,628
C'mon. Dance with me.

989
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,797
You go ahead. Go do it.
I'll catch up with you.

990
01:10:18,920 --> 01:10:20,797
- Sure?
- Yeah.

991
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:34,036
- Daphne, you got any whiskey?
- What kind do you want?

992
01:10:34,160 --> 01:10:37,436
- Macallan 18.
- I'll see if we got any upstairs.

993
01:10:37,560 --> 01:10:40,438
Hold up, I'll come with you.
Back in a flash.

994
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:50,553
I can't believe you brought
my student in here.

995
01:10:50,680 --> 01:10:52,636
C'mon.

996
01:10:52,760 --> 01:10:54,398
C'mon, she's cute.

997
01:10:54,520 --> 01:10:57,557
She's cute, she is. She talks
too much but she's cute.

998
01:10:57,680 --> 01:11:01,309
You're gonna get me fired.
You realise that?

999
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:03,431
She's gonna tell her friends,

1000
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:06,438
they'll tell their friends,
they keep talking...

1001
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,790
What'll they say?
You met her at a club,

1002
01:11:08,920 --> 01:11:12,959
ran into her, talked a little bit.
You've done nothing wrong yet.

1003
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:16,993
- What do you mean, yet?
- She's hot. She's all over you.

1004
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,758
She's 17. Alright?

1005
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,518
She's my student.

1006
01:11:20,640 --> 01:11:23,791
I can't, you know, just touch her...

1007
01:11:23,920 --> 01:11:26,912
No, not now. But in seven months,
she'll graduate.

1008
01:11:27,040 --> 01:11:29,110
The age Naturelle was when I met her.

1009
01:11:29,240 --> 01:11:32,437
- Like I said, not yet, you know?
- OK.

1010
01:11:32,560 --> 01:11:34,676
- I'm kidding.
- Well, you know...

1011
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,472
No. I'm giving you a hard time.

1012
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:39,512
You're smart,
you're way too smart for that shit.

1013
01:11:39,640 --> 01:11:42,552
Really. You've always been smart
about that stuff.

1014
01:11:42,680 --> 01:11:45,956
I respect that, I really do. I do.

1015
01:11:48,320 --> 01:11:51,278
Here. What do you say?

1016
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:55,279
I tell you,
one more of these and I'm pissed.

1017
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:58,233
- Listen. Make me a toast.
- You want a toast?

1018
01:11:58,360 --> 01:12:01,591
Yeah, come on. I'm not
going to see you for a long time.

1019
01:12:01,720 --> 01:12:04,712
I want to have a nice memory.
Say something nice.

1020
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,272
OK.

1021
01:12:23,200 --> 01:12:27,512
Jesus, Jake. Relax. Don't...
Here. Here's to Doyle.

1022
01:12:27,640 --> 01:12:29,949
- To Doyle.
- Alright. Your dog now.

1023
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,277
- No!
- Yeah. He loves you.

1024
01:12:33,400 --> 01:12:35,391
- Yeah?
- He loves you, really.

1025
01:12:35,520 --> 01:12:38,273
- And he needs a home.
- Yeah, I don't know...

1026
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:41,756
You've seen the size
of my apartment. Right?

1027
01:12:41,880 --> 01:12:44,997
So what? Doyle's a tough dog.
He's seen worse.

1028
01:12:45,120 --> 01:12:48,476
He'll learn to live in
a small space. He'll survive.

1029
01:12:48,600 --> 01:12:52,115
- What about Nat?
- She's moving in with her mother.

1030
01:12:52,240 --> 01:12:53,912
The woman fucking hates him.

1031
01:12:54,040 --> 01:12:59,478
And Doyle detests Frank
and my father's allergic, so...

1032
01:13:00,640 --> 01:13:02,870
Saving him. Saving him...

1033
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:07,278
I swear, the best thing I ever did
was save that little son of a bitch.

1034
01:13:07,400 --> 01:13:10,472
Cos every day that he's had since,
that's because of me.

1035
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:14,195
Will you take him home, will you
give him a home while I'm gone?

1036
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:16,470
I'd be honoured.

1037
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:18,636
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1038
01:13:34,240 --> 01:13:36,629
This joint is jumpin', boy.

1039
01:13:36,760 --> 01:13:38,830
It's a smorgasbord of girlies.

1040
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:41,599
- And you're the talent scout!
- How you doing?

1041
01:13:41,720 --> 01:13:43,597
- Good.
- Good?

1042
01:13:46,360 --> 01:13:49,272
So who's that little tart
with you, Jake?

1043
01:13:49,600 --> 01:13:52,068
- My student.
- Hot student.

1044
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:56,918
What?

1045
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,152
No! Not the student?

1046
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:03,157
Terry's friend, the student?

1047
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,238
You know what? Remind me
never to tell you anything.

1048
01:14:06,360 --> 01:14:09,033
Leave him. He's the only
honest man in the room.

1049
01:14:09,160 --> 01:14:11,799
- Doing noble work.
- Party begins without me?

1050
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:14,150
That's right, you fat Russian fuck.

1051
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:18,512
- Fat Ukrainian fuck!
- Yeah, there's a difference?

1052
01:14:18,640 --> 01:14:20,790
- Monty, you here long?
- Not long.

1053
01:14:20,920 --> 01:14:24,117
- You open shampanskoe without me.
- The clock's ticking!

1054
01:14:24,240 --> 01:14:26,196
- I don't have time.
- Hello, Frank.

1055
01:14:26,320 --> 01:14:29,278
- Konstantine.
- Kostya, please. I am good.

1056
01:14:29,400 --> 01:14:33,234
I am better when our friend
comes back to us, no? Jason, yes?

1057
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:35,749
- Jacob.
- My shampanskoe, you like?

1058
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:37,916
It's OK.

1059
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,037
Monty, I have beautiful woman.
Very nice.

1060
01:14:43,160 --> 01:14:45,674
I'm not really in the mood.
I got a nice girl...

1061
01:14:45,800 --> 01:14:48,075
I know, I know.
Tonight is special night.

1062
01:14:48,200 --> 01:14:52,034
Last night as free man.
I pick her out special, just for you.

1063
01:14:52,160 --> 01:14:55,948
The last girl you picked for me
had three teeth. All in the back.

1064
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:01,591
Funny you should say that.

1065
01:15:01,720 --> 01:15:03,631
Why is it funny I should say that?

1066
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:05,352
What you say, it was funny.

1067
01:15:05,480 --> 01:15:08,153
Kostya, when you...
That's an expression.

1068
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:11,078
- If you say that...
- It's a euphemism, right?

1069
01:15:11,200 --> 01:15:13,998
Can you explain this?
You're the English teacher.

1070
01:15:14,960 --> 01:15:16,234
I think what he means,

1071
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:20,148
Kostya, is that when you say,
"Funny you should say that,"

1072
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:24,796
that means that it reminds you
of a funny story.

1073
01:15:24,920 --> 01:15:26,751
No, no.

1074
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:30,031
It was funny what you say.
"Funny you should say that."

1075
01:15:30,160 --> 01:15:32,469
It makes no sense.
This is what I deal with.

1076
01:15:32,600 --> 01:15:35,239
- This is what I'm talking about.
- I'm with you.

1077
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:37,510
- Come. You see her.
- I don't think so.

1078
01:15:37,640 --> 01:15:41,189
- Naturelle is here.
- We go quick. You see this bitch.

1079
01:15:41,320 --> 01:15:45,074
Find some nice girls for my friends.
They're on their own.

1080
01:15:45,200 --> 01:15:46,553
I'm fine.

1081
01:15:46,680 --> 01:15:49,069
Let's just go down. Come with me.

1082
01:15:49,200 --> 01:15:52,909
No, no. Forget that. I gotta
talk to you for, like, five minutes.

1083
01:15:53,040 --> 01:15:55,873
- Shall I stay here?
- Yeah. Look out for Naturelle

1084
01:15:56,000 --> 01:15:57,797
and... your field trip.

1085
01:15:57,920 --> 01:16:01,196
Should I tell Nat
you're having sex with prostitutes?

1086
01:16:01,320 --> 01:16:03,709
- No, don't say this.
- Say what you want.

1087
01:16:03,840 --> 01:16:07,355
Just don't go away, alright?
We'll go uptown and get Doyle.

1088
01:16:08,600 --> 01:16:10,830
- So when can we hook up?
- I get off at four.

1089
01:16:10,960 --> 01:16:14,509
- We going to the private room?
- Of course. The private room.

1090
01:16:19,160 --> 01:16:22,516
I gotta talk to Frank
for five minutes.

1091
01:16:22,640 --> 01:16:25,234
After girl,
Uncle Nikolai wants talk with you.

1092
01:16:25,360 --> 01:16:27,715
I know, Kostya.
Give me five minutes.

1093
01:16:27,840 --> 01:16:31,549
- They're waiting.
- I know! Five fucking minutes.

1094
01:17:06,280 --> 01:17:10,159
- She looks good in silver.
- Yeah.

1095
01:17:10,280 --> 01:17:13,078
You know, Naturelle...
I've told you this, right?

1096
01:17:13,200 --> 01:17:15,111
- What?
- She's the only girl

1097
01:17:15,240 --> 01:17:17,993
I kept fantasising about
after I'd slept with her.

1098
01:17:18,120 --> 01:17:21,032
- Is that normal?
- That's a pretty good normal.

1099
01:17:21,160 --> 01:17:23,913
- My ace deuce.
- Fellas.

1100
01:17:24,040 --> 01:17:25,996
- Tomorrow?
- That's right.

1101
01:17:26,120 --> 01:17:28,190
Nothing but a catnap. Stay cool.

1102
01:17:31,560 --> 01:17:33,232
Fuck!

1103
01:17:38,680 --> 01:17:42,468
- How you doing, brother? Alright?
- Six months, you know?

1104
01:17:43,480 --> 01:17:47,189
Six months before I got pinched,
I was gonna come to you.

1105
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:49,993
- "Put me in stocks, in mutuals."
- Don't do this.

1106
01:17:50,120 --> 01:17:52,998
"I'm gonna kick back,
watch my coin multiply,

1107
01:17:53,120 --> 01:17:55,236
we'll get rich together."

1108
01:17:55,360 --> 01:17:59,114
I just thought, I can
take out a little more to live on.

1109
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:02,198
I got greedy. Greedy.
I fucked myself.

1110
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,073
You'll go round the twist
thinking about this.

1111
01:18:05,200 --> 01:18:08,556
That's all I can do.
All I can do is think about it.

1112
01:18:08,680 --> 01:18:10,591
- I won't make it, Frank.
- You will.

1113
01:18:10,720 --> 01:18:13,837
There's a thousand guys up there
who are harder than me.

1114
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:15,871
Some junkie doesn't want to pay me,

1115
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:18,230
with Kostya behind me,
I'm pretty scary.

1116
01:18:18,360 --> 01:18:21,238
Up there, I'm a skinny white boy
with no friends.

1117
01:18:22,040 --> 01:18:24,793
Those guys are going to use me up
and end me.

1118
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:26,956
No, they won't, man.

1119
01:18:27,080 --> 01:18:29,640
You know why?
You're smarter than all of them.

1120
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,911
You get up there, keep
your eyes open, your mouth shut.

1121
01:18:33,040 --> 01:18:35,952
You're gonna know the names,
the whole scenario.

1122
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:38,958
- You'll have it wired in a week.
- It's overcrowded.

1123
01:18:39,080 --> 01:18:42,834
They got bunk beds in the gymnasium
to handle the overflow.

1124
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:46,396
I'm going in a room
with 200 other guys, Frank.

1125
01:18:47,240 --> 01:18:49,754
So picture this.
First night, lights out.

1126
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:52,917
The guards are going, looking back,
laughing at me.

1127
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,634
You are miles from home.

1128
01:18:56,440 --> 01:18:58,635
Door closes, boom. I'm on the floor,

1129
01:18:58,760 --> 01:19:00,432
some big guy's knee in my back.

1130
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,120
I give it a go
but there's too many of them.

1131
01:19:03,240 --> 01:19:05,913
They pull a pipe from a mattress
and beat my face.

1132
01:19:06,040 --> 01:19:08,156
Not to hurt me.
To knock all my teeth out

1133
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,033
so I can give him head all night
without biting.

1134
01:19:11,160 --> 01:19:15,438
Let's say I make seven years,
minus 84 days for good behaviour.

1135
01:19:15,560 --> 01:19:18,028
What then?
What kind of skills do I have?

1136
01:19:18,160 --> 01:19:21,709
Can't get a job in the straight
world or go back to this.

1137
01:19:21,840 --> 01:19:25,196
It's 15 years to life
for a second pinch. I mean...

1138
01:19:26,600 --> 01:19:30,513
I'll be a 38-year-old punked-out
ex-con, with government dentures.

1139
01:19:30,640 --> 01:19:32,392
38 is still young.

1140
01:19:32,520 --> 01:19:36,718
You'll get out, you and me, we'll
start something. A fucking bar.

1141
01:19:36,840 --> 01:19:39,991
We're Irish kids from Brooklyn.
We should have a bar.

1142
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,588
How could we not have a bar?

1143
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:46,269
We'll have free hot dogs
on Monday Night Football.

1144
01:19:46,400 --> 01:19:50,712
An old jukebox in the corner.
Green beer on St Paddy's Day...

1145
01:19:50,840 --> 01:19:54,435
I hate green beer. You've worked
15 years to get away from it.

1146
01:19:54,560 --> 01:19:57,313
I hate the shit, too.
But we got options, right?

1147
01:19:57,440 --> 01:19:59,351
I appreciate the thought.

1148
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:04,034
I don't see it. Seven years, you'll
have your own show, without me.

1149
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:06,151
I've known you since I was three.

1150
01:20:06,280 --> 01:20:08,919
Have I ever
broken a promise to you?

1151
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,996
Have I ever once broken a promise?

1152
01:20:11,120 --> 01:20:14,351
Have I ever said I'm gonna be
somewhere and not shown up?

1153
01:20:14,480 --> 01:20:15,276
No.

1154
01:20:15,400 --> 01:20:17,789
I'm gonna be there
when you get out.

1155
01:20:17,920 --> 01:20:20,559
You hear me?
I'm gonna fucking be there.

1156
01:20:20,680 --> 01:20:24,275
I know. I know you will.
But you can't be there tomorrow.

1157
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:26,436
And it's all about tomorrow.

1158
01:20:30,520 --> 01:20:33,034
Listen. I got one idea.

1159
01:20:33,160 --> 01:20:35,958
One way I might buy myself
a little room to breathe.

1160
01:20:36,080 --> 01:20:39,231
- I need a big favour from you.
- Cool.

1161
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,352
Jake the snake.

1162
01:22:22,840 --> 01:22:25,673
- What are you doing?
- Don't panic. Who gives a shit?

1163
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:26,835
I give a shit.

1164
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,715
You know what happens
if someone sees me?

1165
01:22:38,760 --> 01:22:41,399
- I beg your pardon, Mr Elinsky.
- Are you drunk?

1166
01:22:41,520 --> 01:22:44,478
Yeah. And I had some E earlier.

1167
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,955
I didn't need to know that.

1168
01:22:49,200 --> 01:22:51,509
You know, Naturelle is cool as shit.

1169
01:22:51,640 --> 01:22:55,155
She knows everyone who works here
and I love that name, right?

1170
01:22:55,280 --> 01:22:57,475
You know, 100 percent Naturelle.

1171
01:22:57,600 --> 01:22:59,955
All Naturelle flavours.

1172
01:23:00,080 --> 01:23:04,073
What's with her boyfriend, Monty?
It's like he owns this place.

1173
01:23:07,160 --> 01:23:08,229
Mary.

1174
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:15,312
Would it be possible to avoid
talking about this at school?

1175
01:23:15,440 --> 01:23:17,078
I mean, this whole night?

1176
01:23:17,200 --> 01:23:20,556
Would it be possible for you to
give me an A for this semester?

1177
01:23:20,680 --> 01:23:22,238
Tell me you're joking.

1178
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,879
- Tell me you're joking.
- I'm joking.

1179
01:23:30,200 --> 01:23:32,156
That's what I love about you.

1180
01:23:32,280 --> 01:23:33,998
What?

1181
01:23:41,080 --> 01:23:42,911
What's what you love about me?

1182
01:23:47,600 --> 01:23:50,717
- Never mind.
- Do you think I'm weird?

1183
01:23:50,840 --> 01:23:52,637
No, I don't think you're weird.

1184
01:23:52,760 --> 01:23:57,072
Are you allowed to stay out
this late? On a school night?

1185
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:58,872
You think my mother gives a shit?

1186
01:23:59,000 --> 01:24:01,833
She's probably
at her boyfriend's anyway.

1187
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:03,951
I need to sleep.

1188
01:24:04,080 --> 01:24:06,275
No. Can't sleep yet.

1189
01:24:07,080 --> 01:24:09,150
Dusk is turning it on.

1190
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:22,315
Is there a bathroom in here?

1191
01:24:23,040 --> 01:24:24,393
Is there?

1192
01:24:24,520 --> 01:24:26,715
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

1193
01:24:26,840 --> 01:24:28,717
Where is it?

1194
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:33,519
It's right up the stairs.

1195
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:36,078
Back there.

1196
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:47,832
- You need to pee?
- No.

1197
01:27:19,760 --> 01:27:21,910
- Hey.
- Hey.

1198
01:27:22,040 --> 01:27:23,712
Can I ask you a favour?

1199
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:28,632
Keep an eye on Monty tonight?
Just try to stick with him.

1200
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:31,717
What's the matter?

1201
01:27:32,720 --> 01:27:36,349
He's just acting really strange.

1202
01:27:37,160 --> 01:27:40,118
He's going to prison soon.
How do you want him to act?

1203
01:27:40,920 --> 01:27:42,990
I want him to act scared.

1204
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,156
He is scared, Naturelle.

1205
01:27:45,960 --> 01:27:47,837
Believe me, he's scared.

1206
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:52,068
I just don't want him
to hurt himself.

1207
01:27:53,440 --> 01:27:56,193
So will you watch him for me?

1208
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,110
I don't think he wants me here.

1209
01:28:00,760 --> 01:28:03,399
Why?
Why wouldn't he want you here?

1210
01:28:06,120 --> 01:28:08,554
You see the way
he looks at me lately?

1211
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:14,440
It's like he doesn't trust me.

1212
01:28:14,560 --> 01:28:17,279
What reason does he have
not to trust you?

1213
01:28:17,400 --> 01:28:20,312
I'm going to go uptown, Francis.

1214
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,795
So when you see him, just...

1215
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:25,670
Cool. I got it.

1216
01:28:35,400 --> 01:28:38,312
- Are you alright?
- How could he do this?

1217
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:43,032
Just throw it all away?
I'm his oldest friend.

1218
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:46,679
What did I do to stop it?
What did I say? Nothing.

1219
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:48,870
Not a word.

1220
01:28:50,320 --> 01:28:53,596
When he started selling weed
to the kids at Coventry,

1221
01:28:53,720 --> 01:28:55,597
I didn't say shit.

1222
01:28:57,400 --> 01:29:00,949
Everybody's talking about buying
from Monty, the whole school.

1223
01:29:01,080 --> 01:29:03,833
I knew they were gonna nail him.
I knew it.

1224
01:29:06,320 --> 01:29:07,639
I didn't say a word.

1225
01:29:07,760 --> 01:29:10,877
Fucking last ten years,
I've watched him get deeper

1226
01:29:11,000 --> 01:29:15,551
with these friends, these fucks
you wouldn't want petting Doyle.

1227
01:29:15,680 --> 01:29:19,036
Did I say, "Careful, Monty.
You better cool out, man"?

1228
01:29:20,440 --> 01:29:22,112
I didn't say shit.

1229
01:29:23,320 --> 01:29:26,357
I just sat there
and watched him ruin his life.

1230
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:28,869
And you did, too. We both did.

1231
01:29:29,000 --> 01:29:31,673
- We all did.
- Monty never listens.

1232
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:35,475
You know how stubborn he is.
I told him to quit a hundred times.

1233
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:39,559
Did you? Before or after
you moved into his apartment?

1234
01:29:39,680 --> 01:29:42,240
- Not tonight! Don't start.
- Who paid for that?

1235
01:29:42,360 --> 01:29:44,954
I need a drink.

1236
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:48,997
JD, shot.

1237
01:29:51,760 --> 01:29:54,797
Before or after he gave you
that platinum necklace?

1238
01:29:54,920 --> 01:29:57,639
Wanna watch your mouth?

1239
01:29:58,480 --> 01:30:02,996
What paid for the Cartier
diamond earrings? This silver dress?

1240
01:30:04,000 --> 01:30:07,959
Paid in full by the addictions
of others. That's what I'm saying.

1241
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:11,231
You two fly down to San Juan.
First class, all the way.

1242
01:30:11,360 --> 01:30:13,510
What do you think paid
for Puerto Rico?

1243
01:30:13,640 --> 01:30:16,916
Listen! You'd never been
to PR in your life before Monty.

1244
01:30:17,040 --> 01:30:19,679
You told him to quit?
The hell you did.

1245
01:30:19,800 --> 01:30:23,873
You knew the deal
the minute you met him. Come on.

1246
01:30:24,000 --> 01:30:27,436
You never had a job in your life.
You live off the fat of the land.

1247
01:30:27,560 --> 01:30:29,596
You never said a goddamn word.

1248
01:30:29,720 --> 01:30:32,792
Who are you to get all righteous
with me?

1249
01:30:32,920 --> 01:30:33,955
Did you disown him?

1250
01:30:34,080 --> 01:30:37,550
His best friend said nothing
but it's my fault? I'm the evil one?

1251
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:40,592
I never took his money. Never once.

1252
01:30:40,720 --> 01:30:44,793
How long you been saving this?
I came to talk to my friend Francis.

1253
01:30:44,920 --> 01:30:47,434
A minute ago you were my friend.
Are you drunk?

1254
01:30:47,560 --> 01:30:49,994
Tell me you don't know
what you're saying.

1255
01:30:50,120 --> 01:30:53,476
I'm Irish. I can't get drunk.
I know exactly what I'm saying.

1256
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,354
In seven years, I'll be at the prison
gate. You'll be married to money.

1257
01:30:57,480 --> 01:31:00,597
What is wrong with you?
You want me to be the bad guy? Fine.

1258
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,678
I'm the bad guy. Are you happy now?

1259
01:31:07,360 --> 01:31:09,237
Francis...

1260
01:31:10,640 --> 01:31:12,517
All I'm saying...

1261
01:31:14,280 --> 01:31:16,748
...is you knew where he hid the money.

1262
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:20,511
You knew where he hid the drugs,
didn't you?

1263
01:31:20,640 --> 01:31:24,997
What the hell are you saying?
What the hell are you saying?

1264
01:31:26,000 --> 01:31:27,433
You know what I'm saying.

1265
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:29,949
I told Monty when he first met you,

1266
01:31:30,080 --> 01:31:32,275
but he wouldn't listen to me.

1267
01:31:33,480 --> 01:31:36,074
I told him Naturelle Riviera,

1268
01:31:36,200 --> 01:31:38,760
she ain't nothing
but a Spic skank skeezer.

1269
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:43,715
- Nat...
- Move.

1270
01:31:49,240 --> 01:31:51,879
- Been looking all over for you.
- Another one?

1271
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,110
- Here you go.
- Is she alright?

1272
01:31:58,240 --> 01:32:00,310
Can we get out of here?

1273
01:32:01,520 --> 01:32:03,750
No. We gotta wait for Monty.

1274
01:32:07,640 --> 01:32:09,710
I kissed her.

1275
01:32:10,200 --> 01:32:12,714
You what?

1276
01:32:12,840 --> 01:32:15,354
My student. I... I kissed her.

1277
01:32:15,480 --> 01:32:17,596
Who you trying to be? R Kelly?

1278
01:32:22,120 --> 01:32:24,475
I kissed my 17-year-old student.

1279
01:32:24,600 --> 01:32:27,797
Jake. Have a drink. Shut the fuck up.

1280
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:29,717
Excuse me. Could I have a water?

1281
01:32:29,840 --> 01:32:32,912
- Fuck that. Hit him. Hit him.
- OK.

1282
01:32:33,760 --> 01:32:35,796
I don't wanna drink any more, Frank.

1283
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,514
Give him the whiskey. Shut up. Drink.

1284
01:33:08,000 --> 01:33:11,629
- Montgomery. How's the party?
- Nice. Thanks for setting it up.

1285
01:33:12,920 --> 01:33:17,835
The first time I went to prison,
I was 14 years old.

1286
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:21,350
Skinny little boy. Very afraid.

1287
01:33:22,520 --> 01:33:25,398
By the time I came out,
I had a beard.

1288
01:33:25,520 --> 01:33:27,590
I was a grown man.

1289
01:33:27,720 --> 01:33:29,711
I went back to my home town.

1290
01:33:29,840 --> 01:33:31,398
I found my mother.

1291
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:34,751
I kissed her and she screamed.

1292
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:36,871
She didn't recognise me.

1293
01:33:43,280 --> 01:33:45,953
I have been
in three different prisons.

1294
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:48,230
Three different countries.

1295
01:33:49,240 --> 01:33:51,276
And you know what I learned?

1296
01:33:51,920 --> 01:33:55,151
I learned
prison is a bad place to be.

1297
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,911
Seven years is a long time.

1298
01:34:03,040 --> 01:34:07,033
Some men will do anything
to avoid seven years in prison.

1299
01:34:07,160 --> 01:34:10,311
Your father... is a hard-working man.

1300
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:13,957
Where's his bar?

1301
01:34:14,080 --> 01:34:16,150
In Staten Island?

1302
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,157
2192 Bay Street.

1303
01:34:19,040 --> 01:34:21,349
He drives in from Bay Ridge

1304
01:34:21,480 --> 01:34:24,552
in a 1986 Jeep Grand Wagoneer.

1305
01:34:24,680 --> 01:34:27,956
- Should I tell you how many miles...
- Khorosho.

1306
01:34:28,960 --> 01:34:30,393
Your father.

1307
01:34:30,520 --> 01:34:32,715
I like your father.

1308
01:34:32,840 --> 01:34:34,876
A hard-working man.

1309
01:34:37,080 --> 01:34:39,833
He's had bad luck.

1310
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,475
Everyone in the neighbourhood
loved your mother. Tak?

1311
01:34:43,600 --> 01:34:47,354
Yeah. Everyone said
she was a beautiful woman.

1312
01:34:47,480 --> 01:34:49,789
I want to help your father.

1313
01:34:49,920 --> 01:34:53,435
I could use a man like that.
A hard-working man.

1314
01:34:53,560 --> 01:34:55,949
A man I could trust.

1315
01:34:56,080 --> 01:34:58,833
I could take care of your father.
You understand?

1316
01:34:58,960 --> 01:35:00,552
You don't have to do this.

1317
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:04,070
I never said anything to anyone.
Leave my father out of it.

1318
01:35:04,200 --> 01:35:07,829
- I asked you a question.
- I know exactly what you mean.

1319
01:35:07,960 --> 01:35:10,315
I have a good job for your father.

1320
01:35:10,440 --> 01:35:12,635
It will help him
with the money he owes.

1321
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:13,829
No, thank you.

1322
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:23,552
Good weapon.

1323
01:35:25,920 --> 01:35:27,990
Accurate.

1324
01:35:28,120 --> 01:35:30,554
And reliable. No jams.

1325
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:35,870
Have you ever fired a gun?
At someone, I mean.

1326
01:35:36,600 --> 01:35:38,079
- No.
- It's toy for you.

1327
01:35:38,200 --> 01:35:41,431
Not toy. Prop.
A prop for you, like an actor.

1328
01:35:41,560 --> 01:35:43,437
Am I wrong?

1329
01:35:44,120 --> 01:35:47,635
With a gun,
you feel more... dangerous.

1330
01:35:47,760 --> 01:35:50,479
I wouldn't know. It's not mine.

1331
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:53,831
I didn't say anything.
I never said anything, Nikolai.

1332
01:35:53,960 --> 01:35:57,589
I swear to God.
They came after me to get to you.

1333
01:35:57,720 --> 01:36:00,314
I know that, you know that.
They tried.

1334
01:36:00,440 --> 01:36:02,271
I never said anything.

1335
01:36:08,800 --> 01:36:10,836
I believe you, Montgomery.

1336
01:36:13,280 --> 01:36:15,475
This is my advice to you.

1337
01:36:16,600 --> 01:36:20,036
When you get there,
figure it out, who is who.

1338
01:36:20,160 --> 01:36:22,071
Find a man nobody's protecting.

1339
01:36:22,200 --> 01:36:24,794
A man without friends.

1340
01:36:24,920 --> 01:36:27,195
And beat him until his eyes bleed.

1341
01:36:27,320 --> 01:36:31,199
Let them think you are a little crazy
but respectful, too.

1342
01:36:31,320 --> 01:36:33,311
Respectful of the right men.

1343
01:36:33,440 --> 01:36:36,671
You're a good-looking boy.
It won't be easy for you.

1344
01:36:36,800 --> 01:36:41,828
But remember, I was 14
when I first went. Va vyzhil.

1345
01:36:42,480 --> 01:36:45,199
I tattooed "survive" on my hand

1346
01:36:45,320 --> 01:36:47,754
the night before
I went away to prison.

1347
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:50,437
And I did.

1348
01:36:52,000 --> 01:36:54,798
We do what we have to do to survive.

1349
01:37:06,640 --> 01:37:09,757
- Monty, please. Monty!
- Now we have this other problem.

1350
01:37:09,880 --> 01:37:12,440
Who knew you kept the stuff
inside the sofa?

1351
01:37:12,560 --> 01:37:15,358
Your girlfriend and Kostya.
Nobody else.

1352
01:37:15,480 --> 01:37:18,631
Get him up. Kostya ratted you out.

1353
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:21,513
He made a call and stole
seven years from your life.

1354
01:37:21,640 --> 01:37:23,039
They put the clamps on him.

1355
01:37:23,160 --> 01:37:26,675
Instead of being a man about it,
doing his time, he sold you out.

1356
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:27,755
It's not true.

1357
01:37:27,880 --> 01:37:30,553
- You know how to use it?
- Yeah, I know.

1358
01:37:30,680 --> 01:37:34,753
Good. He does not deserve to live.
He betrayed you. He betrayed me.

1359
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,235
He stole from you.
He stole seven years.

1360
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:40,670
- End him.
- No, no, no. No. Don't do this.

1361
01:37:40,800 --> 01:37:44,588
Shut up! Shut up. Don't talk.
You motherfucker.

1362
01:37:44,720 --> 01:37:47,712
Why'd you do it? Why?
You let me think it was her.

1363
01:37:47,840 --> 01:37:49,796
- Why tell me it was her?
- Don't...

1364
01:37:49,920 --> 01:37:52,275
- Why say it was her?
- Kill this cockroach.

1365
01:37:52,400 --> 01:37:54,391
- Why?
- Monty, no.

1366
01:37:54,520 --> 01:37:56,158
Why? Why?

1367
01:37:56,280 --> 01:37:58,191
- Why tell me it was her?
- Do it!

1368
01:37:58,320 --> 01:38:00,390
I have no choice.

1369
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,953
I have no choice, Monty.

1370
01:38:02,080 --> 01:38:04,878
- Please.
- Why? Why? Why?

1371
01:38:11,120 --> 01:38:12,997
I have no choice.

1372
01:38:15,160 --> 01:38:17,037
I have no choice.

1373
01:38:18,200 --> 01:38:20,953
You told me to trust this man,
I trusted him.

1374
01:38:21,080 --> 01:38:25,278
Now I'm gone seven.
Clean up your own fucking mess.

1375
01:38:25,400 --> 01:38:27,630
- Careful.
- You do what you want with him.

1376
01:38:27,760 --> 01:38:31,355
When I walk out this door, I'm done.
I'm out and my father's out.

1377
01:38:31,480 --> 01:38:35,029
- You are being foolish.
- You gonna let me go or not?

1378
01:38:35,160 --> 01:38:37,355
Remember what I told you.

1379
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:41,870
A man... with no friends.

1380
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:45,439
- Monty, please. Don't leave me.
- Monty, come on.

1381
01:38:45,560 --> 01:38:47,516
- Please!
- You were my friend.

1382
01:38:48,280 --> 01:38:50,157
Monty.
I'm sorry. Don't leave me.

1383
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:53,078
Come on.
You are missing your party.

1384
01:39:14,720 --> 01:39:16,676
You know what time it is?

1385
01:39:16,800 --> 01:39:20,315
- You know what time it is?
- Late at night. No, it's early.

1386
01:39:23,400 --> 01:39:26,790
- You up for a little more still?
- Yeah.

1387
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:29,796
Yeah, definitely.

1388
01:39:44,800 --> 01:39:47,075
Hey, that's Jake. Remember Jake?

1389
01:39:47,640 --> 01:39:49,949
Come here. Go see Jake.

1390
01:40:28,640 --> 01:40:30,870
- What time is it?
- I got a couple of hours.

1391
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:37,589
I'm sorry for everything
I put you through, Naturelle.

1392
01:40:38,600 --> 01:40:44,072
I've been confused.
I've been... thinking that you...

1393
01:40:47,200 --> 01:40:49,668
- Doesn't matter.
- It matters to me.

1394
01:40:50,800 --> 01:40:56,272
- Don't hate me when I'm gone.
- I could never hate you.

1395
01:40:56,400 --> 01:40:58,197
I love you.

1396
01:41:03,200 --> 01:41:05,760
- Stay with me.
- One last thing I gotta do.

1397
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,348
- Don't go.
- I'll be back.

1398
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:23,395
Wouldn't that be the life?

1399
01:42:23,520 --> 01:42:25,431
Working a tugboat.

1400
01:42:25,560 --> 01:42:29,030
- Out on the river every morning.
- Yeah, it'd be nice.

1401
01:42:30,560 --> 01:42:32,710
It'd be nice.

1402
01:42:43,320 --> 01:42:45,595
What time you got?

1403
01:42:47,240 --> 01:42:50,437
- Quarter past six.
- Alright.

1404
01:42:51,400 --> 01:42:54,551
Alright. Come on.

1405
01:43:22,880 --> 01:43:26,429
- You ready for Mr Doyle?
- Yeah.

1406
01:43:26,560 --> 01:43:29,154
The leash is yours.

1407
01:43:49,480 --> 01:43:53,234
I need you to make me ugly.
I can't go in looking like this.

1408
01:43:53,360 --> 01:43:55,590
I told you.
It's all about the first day.

1409
01:43:55,720 --> 01:43:59,315
If they get one look at me
looking like this, I'll be finished.

1410
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:02,432
You said anything.
You just said you'd do anything.

1411
01:44:03,720 --> 01:44:04,914
This is what I need.

1412
01:44:05,040 --> 01:44:09,238
What are you thinking? I give you a
black eye, no one will mess with you?

1413
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:12,909
- I need more than a black eye.
- Fucking help me here.

1414
01:44:13,040 --> 01:44:15,759
- I need you to really fuck me up.
- I can't do it.

1415
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:21,752
- You can.
- I won't hit you.

1416
01:44:21,880 --> 01:44:24,235
- I think you want to a little bit.
- What?

1417
01:44:24,360 --> 01:44:27,591
You think I've deserved it for years.
You give me that look,

1418
01:44:27,720 --> 01:44:31,395
like you'll smack some sense into me.
Here's your chance. I need it.

1419
01:44:31,520 --> 01:44:33,431
This is your favour? "Make me ugly"?

1420
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:36,870
Where the hell is this
coming from? This is bullshit!

1421
01:44:37,000 --> 01:44:38,831
Don't pussy out on me, Frank.

1422
01:44:38,960 --> 01:44:41,599
I need this from you.
I won't fight back...

1423
01:44:41,720 --> 01:44:45,508
I'm not gonna kick your...
What the fuck do you want from me?

1424
01:44:45,640 --> 01:44:47,198
- This is insane.
- Shut up!

1425
01:44:47,320 --> 01:44:49,959
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.
Stay out of it.

1426
01:44:50,080 --> 01:44:51,559
Enough! This is bullshit.

1427
01:44:51,680 --> 01:44:54,194
Let's go get breakfast.
Forget this shit.

1428
01:44:54,320 --> 01:44:57,039
- No breakfast.
- Hey! Don't do this, Monty.

1429
01:44:57,160 --> 01:45:00,436
Where's this bullshit you fed me?
"I'll be there for you."

1430
01:45:00,560 --> 01:45:03,120
- I will, but I won't hit you.
- Bullshit.

1431
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:06,755
- He doesn't know what he's doing.
- This is convenient for you.

1432
01:45:06,880 --> 01:45:08,871
- That's what I think.
- Convenient?

1433
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:12,629
Send me away, say, "Bye, Monty,"
take care of Naturelle for me.

1434
01:45:12,760 --> 01:45:15,911
I would never fucking
cross that line. You're full of shit!

1435
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,712
Frank, he doesn't mean it.

1436
01:45:17,840 --> 01:45:20,308
The way you look at her.
Her titties, her ass.

1437
01:45:20,440 --> 01:45:22,396
You've wanted to fuck her for years.

1438
01:45:22,520 --> 01:45:24,078
Don't fucking do this!

1439
01:45:27,320 --> 01:45:29,311
Stop it!

1440
01:45:31,240 --> 01:45:34,755
- Don't do this!
- Now, Frank. Now. Do it.

1441
01:45:38,680 --> 01:45:41,148
Do it, you fucking pussy.

1442
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:55,755
Stop, Frank. Stop!

1443
01:46:08,120 --> 01:46:10,315
I'm sorry.

1444
01:46:10,440 --> 01:46:12,556
That's enough. Stop.

1445
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:52,671
Oh, my God!

1446
01:47:53,840 --> 01:47:55,831
Monty! Oh, my God!

1447
01:47:55,960 --> 01:47:58,315
OK. It's alright. Just get me inside.

1448
01:47:58,440 --> 01:48:00,670
Get me inside.

1449
01:48:00,800 --> 01:48:03,189
Of course I will.

1450
01:48:03,320 --> 01:48:05,197
Oh, my God, baby.

1451
01:48:10,240 --> 01:48:12,117
Oh, my God.

1452
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:25,590
Monty, let me take you to hospital.

1453
01:48:25,720 --> 01:48:28,029
Why did you stay with me
all this time?

1454
01:48:28,160 --> 01:48:31,914
- Should've left me long ago.
- Stop talking like that.

1455
01:48:35,360 --> 01:48:38,511
I'll wait for you.
As long as it takes.

1456
01:48:41,440 --> 01:48:42,793
Don't cry, baby.

1457
01:48:42,920 --> 01:48:45,275
I'm such an idiot.

1458
01:48:45,400 --> 01:48:47,436
Naturelle, I blew it.

1459
01:48:48,480 --> 01:48:50,516
I really blew it.

1460
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:11,997
Who's that?

1461
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:19,715
- Who did this to you?
- We gotta go.

1462
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:22,035
Let him take you to the hospital.

1463
01:49:22,160 --> 01:49:24,116
It's OK. It's OK.

1464
01:49:31,440 --> 01:49:34,273
- How did this happen?
- He just showed up like this.

1465
01:49:36,040 --> 01:49:38,793
- Monty.
- He's a mess.

1466
01:49:39,680 --> 01:49:41,272
Look at him.

1467
01:49:41,400 --> 01:49:44,358
Oh, God.
These people are hooligans.

1468
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:49,075
I'll take him to the hospital.

1469
01:49:51,400 --> 01:49:54,392
- Say goodbye here, Pop.
- You don't trust my driving?

1470
01:49:57,160 --> 01:49:59,549
I can't do it this way.

1471
01:49:59,680 --> 01:50:02,353
Just let me walk away,
Pop, please. It's easier.

1472
01:50:02,480 --> 01:50:04,391
Yeah. Easier?

1473
01:50:04,520 --> 01:50:06,431
My God, you don't understand.

1474
01:50:07,680 --> 01:50:09,910
Let me drive you there.

1475
01:50:10,040 --> 01:50:13,191
I need to know where it is
for visits, you know?

1476
01:50:13,320 --> 01:50:15,197
OK, buddy?

1477
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:17,996
Help me out.

1478
01:50:18,120 --> 01:50:19,473
- Help me out?
- OK.

1479
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:22,273
- Give me the bag.
- No hospital, Pop.

1480
01:50:23,280 --> 01:50:25,396
No hospital.

1481
01:50:25,520 --> 01:50:27,078
Let's go.

1482
01:50:40,200 --> 01:50:43,192
- I gotta go.
- One second. Wait, wait, wait.

1483
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:04,316
No, no.

1484
01:51:08,200 --> 01:51:10,395
- I don't want you coming to visit.
- No.

1485
01:51:10,520 --> 01:51:14,718
I want you to be happy, so you
forget about me. Live your life.

1486
01:51:35,240 --> 01:51:38,550
I figure we take the Henry Hudson

1487
01:51:38,680 --> 01:51:40,989
to the Sprain Brook Parkway,

1488
01:51:41,120 --> 01:51:43,315
then to the Taconic.

1489
01:51:43,440 --> 01:51:45,396
That should get us there.

1490
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:47,556
Easy drive to Otisville.

1491
01:51:49,320 --> 01:51:51,436
Jesus, look what they did to you.

1492
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:54,438
I tell you, Monty, it'll be OK.

1493
01:51:54,560 --> 01:51:58,997
It looks bad, I know it, but when
the swelling goes down, it'll be OK.

1494
01:51:59,120 --> 01:52:01,429
Them hooligans
sure gave you a licking.

1495
01:52:01,560 --> 01:52:05,473
- How many were there?
- I don't know. A bunch of 'em.

1496
01:52:05,600 --> 01:52:09,434
- You get some good shots in?
- Yeah, I got some good shots in.

1497
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:12,632
Give it a month,
you'll be better-looking than ever.

1498
01:52:12,760 --> 01:52:15,194
Pop.

1499
01:52:15,320 --> 01:52:17,470
You were right. It wasn't her.

1500
01:52:17,600 --> 01:52:19,636
It wasn't Naturelle.

1501
01:52:20,840 --> 01:52:23,115
Of course it wasn't Naturelle.

1502
01:53:04,600 --> 01:53:06,158
Cool dog.

1503
01:53:11,400 --> 01:53:13,914
You're a cool dog.

1504
01:54:35,800 --> 01:54:38,075
Give me the word
and I'll take a left turn.

1505
01:54:38,200 --> 01:54:41,078
- Left turn to where?
- Take the GW Bridge. Go west.

1506
01:54:41,200 --> 01:54:43,475
Get you stitched up and keep going.

1507
01:54:43,600 --> 01:54:46,433
Find a nice little town.

1508
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,313
On the way, stop in Chicago
for a Cubs game.

1509
01:54:49,440 --> 01:54:51,635
You always wanted
to see Wrigley Field.

1510
01:54:51,760 --> 01:54:52,510
Dad...

1511
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:56,315
I'm saying, if you want it,
if that's what you want, I'll do it.

1512
01:54:56,440 --> 01:54:59,000
- No. They'd take your bar.
- My bar?

1513
01:54:59,120 --> 01:55:02,556
Jesus, my bar. They can take
my bar to hell and back.

1514
01:55:02,680 --> 01:55:05,638
You think my bar
means more than my only child?

1515
01:55:05,760 --> 01:55:07,796
Give me the word and we'll go.

1516
01:55:11,520 --> 01:55:13,397
They'll find me.

1517
01:55:14,200 --> 01:55:17,317
- Sooner or later.
- You know how they find people?

1518
01:55:17,440 --> 01:55:19,749
They find them
when they come home.

1519
01:55:20,840 --> 01:55:24,435
People run away but they usually
come back. Then they get caught.

1520
01:55:24,560 --> 01:55:28,951
So you go
and you never come back.

1521
01:55:31,480 --> 01:55:33,550
You never come home.

1522
01:55:36,120 --> 01:55:38,111
We'll drive.

1523
01:55:39,160 --> 01:55:41,037
And keep driving.

1524
01:55:41,880 --> 01:55:44,030
Head out to the middle of nowhere.

1525
01:55:44,160 --> 01:55:46,628
Take that road
as far as it takes us.

1526
01:55:49,160 --> 01:55:51,628
You've never been west of Philly,
have you?

1527
01:55:51,760 --> 01:55:55,150
This is a beautiful country.
It's beautiful out there.

1528
01:55:55,280 --> 01:55:58,113
Looks like a different world.
Mountains, hills,

1529
01:55:58,240 --> 01:56:02,438
cows, farms and white churches.

1530
01:56:10,840 --> 01:56:14,549
I drove out west with your mother
one time, before you was born.

1531
01:56:14,680 --> 01:56:16,910
Brooklyn to the Pacific
in three days.

1532
01:56:17,960 --> 01:56:21,111
Just enough money for gas,
sandwiches and coffee,

1533
01:56:21,240 --> 01:56:23,196
but we made it.

1534
01:56:23,320 --> 01:56:26,312
Every man, woman and child alive
should see the desert

1535
01:56:26,440 --> 01:56:28,670
one time before they die.

1536
01:56:29,480 --> 01:56:31,710
Nothing at all for miles around.

1537
01:56:31,840 --> 01:56:35,389
Nothing but sand and rocks
and cactus and blue sky.

1538
01:56:36,200 --> 01:56:38,236
Not a soul in sight.

1539
01:56:38,360 --> 01:56:41,432
No sirens. No car alarms.

1540
01:56:41,560 --> 01:56:43,551
Nobody honking at you.

1541
01:56:43,680 --> 01:56:46,672
No madmen cursing
or pissing on the streets.

1542
01:56:46,800 --> 01:56:49,155
You find the silence out there.

1543
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,430
You find the peace.

1544
01:56:51,560 --> 01:56:54,279
You can find God.

1545
01:57:04,840 --> 01:57:08,958
You take the high road
and I'll take the low road

1546
01:57:09,080 --> 01:57:12,755
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye

1547
01:57:12,880 --> 01:57:14,711
But me and my true love

1548
01:57:14,840 --> 01:57:16,876
Will never meet again

1549
01:57:17,000 --> 01:57:21,073
On the bonny, bonny banks
of Loch Lomond...

1550
01:57:23,240 --> 01:57:25,595
So we drive west.

1551
01:57:28,600 --> 01:57:31,797
Keep driving
till we find a nice little town.

1552
01:57:31,920 --> 01:57:35,435
These towns out in the desert,
you know why they got there?

1553
01:57:35,560 --> 01:57:38,518
People wanted to get away
from somewhere else.

1554
01:57:38,640 --> 01:57:41,029
The desert's for starting over.

1555
01:57:42,240 --> 01:57:45,277
Find a bar and I'll buy us drinks.

1556
01:57:46,640 --> 01:57:47,595
Two.

1557
01:57:51,480 --> 01:57:55,393
I haven't had a drink in two years,
but I'll have one with you.

1558
01:57:55,520 --> 01:57:58,239
One last whiskey with my boy.

1559
01:57:58,360 --> 01:58:01,318
Take our time with it.
Taste the barley.

1560
01:58:01,440 --> 01:58:03,510
Let it linger.

1561
01:58:12,720 --> 01:58:14,676
And then I'll go.

1562
01:58:25,080 --> 01:58:27,310
I want you to keep that.

1563
01:58:30,040 --> 01:58:31,837
I'll hold it for you.

1564
01:58:45,400 --> 01:58:49,313
I'll tell you, don't ever write me.
Don't ever come visit.

1565
01:58:49,440 --> 01:58:51,590
I'll tell you
I believe in God's kingdom

1566
01:58:51,720 --> 01:58:54,359
and that I'll be with you again,
and your mother,

1567
01:58:54,480 --> 01:58:56,516
but not in this lifetime.

1568
01:59:40,920 --> 01:59:42,990
You'll get a job somewhere.

1569
01:59:44,400 --> 01:59:48,518
A job that pays cash.
A boss who doesn't ask questions.

1570
01:59:48,640 --> 01:59:51,598
You make a new life
and you never come back.

1571
01:59:53,840 --> 01:59:57,913
Monty, people like you. It's a gift.

1572
01:59:58,040 --> 02:00:01,237
- You make friends wherever you go.
- How you doing?

1573
02:00:01,360 --> 02:00:05,558
You're gonna work hard, keep your
head down and your mouth shut.

1574
02:00:05,680 --> 02:00:07,875
You'll make yourself a new home.

1575
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:10,036
Here you go, James.

1576
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:14,874
You're a New Yorker.
That will never change.

1577
02:00:15,000 --> 02:00:16,797
You got New York in your bones.

1578
02:00:16,920 --> 02:00:21,755
Spend the rest of your life out West,
but you're still a New Yorker.

1579
02:00:21,880 --> 02:00:24,269
You'll miss your friends, your dog,

1580
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:27,756
but you're strong. You got
your mother's backbone in you.

1581
02:00:27,880 --> 02:00:30,599
You're strong like she was.

1582
02:00:32,360 --> 02:00:36,797
You find the right people and get
yourself papers. A driver's licence.

1583
02:00:36,920 --> 02:00:38,478
- What's your name?
- James.

1584
02:00:38,600 --> 02:00:41,478
James. Not from around here,
are you?

1585
02:00:41,600 --> 02:00:45,388
- No, I'm from out west.
- Let's just get your picture.

1586
02:00:45,520 --> 02:00:47,954
Be still, give me a smile. OK.

1587
02:00:49,080 --> 02:00:53,278
Now give me a bigger smile, James.
Bigger. OK.

1588
02:00:54,640 --> 02:00:56,870
You forget your old life.

1589
02:00:58,080 --> 02:01:02,039
You can't come back.
You can't call, you can't write.

1590
02:01:02,160 --> 02:01:04,355
You never look back.

1591
02:01:04,480 --> 02:01:07,040
You make a new life for yourself
and you live it.

1592
02:01:07,160 --> 02:01:10,709
You hear me? You live your life
the way it should have been.

1593
02:01:11,520 --> 02:01:14,034
And maybe, and this is dangerous,

1594
02:01:14,160 --> 02:01:18,392
but maybe, after a couple of years,
you send word to Naturelle.

1595
02:01:46,880 --> 02:01:47,869
Four,

1596
02:01:48,000 --> 02:01:52,391
three, two, one...

1597
02:01:52,520 --> 02:01:54,909
- Happy New Year.
- Happy New Year.

1598
02:01:58,320 --> 02:01:59,912
Feel that, right there?

1599
02:02:02,200 --> 02:02:05,875
Your mother's a lunatic.
Hurry up. I need company.

1600
02:02:08,280 --> 02:02:10,589
Get a new family
and raise them right.

1601
02:02:10,720 --> 02:02:14,679
You hear me? Give them a good life.
Give them what they need.

1602
02:02:14,800 --> 02:02:17,997
You have a son.
Maybe you name him James.

1603
02:02:18,120 --> 02:02:20,475
It's a good strong name.
And maybe, one day,

1604
02:02:20,600 --> 02:02:23,717
years from now,
long after I'm dead and gone,

1605
02:02:23,840 --> 02:02:26,070
reunited with your dear mother,

1606
02:02:26,200 --> 02:02:29,670
you gather your family together
and tell them the truth.

1607
02:02:30,840 --> 02:02:33,832
Who you are,
where you come from.

1608
02:02:34,840 --> 02:02:37,957
- You tell them the whole story.
- I was arrested...

1609
02:02:38,080 --> 02:02:44,235
And then you ask them if they know
how lucky they are to be there.

1610
02:02:45,800 --> 02:02:48,633
It all came so close
to never happening.

1611
02:02:51,240 --> 02:02:54,596
This life came so close
to never happening.

1612
02:08:41,000 --> 02:08:42,956
