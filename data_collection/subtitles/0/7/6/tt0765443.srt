1
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:09,500
He says, "Christmas."
So I say to him...

2
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:12,000
Should we go shopping?

3
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,500
The kid's 16.

4
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,600
He says,
"But, Uncle, it's Christmas."

5
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,300
How much you taking off?

6
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:25,300
Uncle Azim...

7
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,900
This is him.
The kid I am talking about.

8
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,800
He looks okay to me.

9
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,800
Ekrem, how you doing?

10
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:40,900
He looks okay, yeah,

11
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:45,800
but he won't do
one lousy thing for me.

12
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:49,900
Here. Look, Ekrem.

13
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,400
Take this.

14
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,800
Azim, please.

15
00:01:54,300 --> 00:01:59,200
You see? We had a deal.
Now he's backing out.

16
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,900
Azim, leave the kid alone.

17
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:06,500
It's obviously
some psychological thing.

18
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,400
<i>Take the fucking ustura
and finish this Rus!</i>

19
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:56,600
Please, I need help.

20
00:02:57,300 --> 00:02:59,200
Do you need methadone?

21
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,100
For methadone,
I need to see prescription.

22
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:17,200
Was she hemorrhaging
when you found her?
Yes.

23
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Did you get a name?
No.

24
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,500
You're all right, sweetheart.
Stay with us, all right?

25
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Baby's in distress.
Her stats are very poor.

26
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:45,300
Fetal heart rate's
at 60, 58, 57
and free falling.

27
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,500
Speak to me.

28
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,900
Placental abruption.
We need to get
the baby out now.

29
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm afraid
we've lost the mother.
Okay, enough.

30
00:04:11,900 --> 00:04:17,200
Call it.
Unidentified woman died
December the 20th, 23:13.

31
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:23,000
Baby girl born
20th of December, 23:14.

32
00:04:57,500 --> 00:04:59,000
Did you sleep?

33
00:04:59,700 --> 00:05:00,800
A bit.

34
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,500
Mum...

35
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,200
Mmm-hmm?

36
00:05:06,700 --> 00:05:08,100
Are you okay?

37
00:05:09,900 --> 00:05:12,200
Of course not.
It's Christmas.

38
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,400
Anna, where did you get this?

39
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:28,100
It's your own fault
for giving him
something to play with.

40
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
Well, I can't read Russian,
can I?

41
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:35,500
I told you, Uncle Stepan.

42
00:05:35,500 --> 00:05:39,200
I found it in
the handbag of the girl
who died in my ward.

43
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:42,200
Do you always rob
the bodies of the dead?

44
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,300
Yes, actually.
We all do it.

45
00:05:44,300 --> 00:05:47,500
It's one of the perks
of working at the hospital.

46
00:05:49,100 --> 00:05:54,900
Did you know
that your daughter robs
the bodies of the dead?

47
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,300
I'm looking
for an address.

48
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:07,100
You have an uncle, Anna,
who doesn't steal
the things from the dead.

49
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,800
Not even their secrets.

50
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:12,900
Oh, don't go
all momentous on us, Stepan.
Lift your elbows.

51
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,600
You should put this
into her coffin.

52
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:22,600
Bury her secrets
with her bodies.

53
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,500
Body.

54
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:27,200
Singular.

55
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,600
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

56
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:47,000
<i>My father died in the mines
in my village,</i>

57
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,900
<i>so he was already buried
when he died.</i>

58
00:06:50,500 --> 00:06:56,000
<i>We were all buried there.
Buried under the soil
of Russia.</i>

59
00:06:55,900 --> 00:06:59,800
<i>That is why I left,
to find a better life.</i>

60
00:07:12,900 --> 00:07:15,400
So...

61
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:17,000
You go pick up Azim
and you bring him back here

62
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,800
<i>with his bitch of a wife.
Da, da. Okay.</i>

63
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Then I'll think of an excuse
and we can get away.

64
00:07:31,700 --> 00:07:33,500
Who the fuck's that?

65
00:07:35,700 --> 00:07:39,600
Maybe somebody sent your dad
a hooker for Christmas.

66
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,900
Man, you're so fucking
unbelievably disrespectful.

67
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Hey, you got work to do.

68
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:53,500
Move!

69
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:55,800
See you.

70
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,800
Oh, no. We are closed.
Yes, I know.

71
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,900
I'm a midwife.

72
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:34,800
Then unless one of
my daughters is keeping
something from me,

73
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,100
you have the wrong address.
I was hoping to speak
to the manager.

74
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,900
Khitrova?

75
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:43,400
My dad was Russian.

76
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,300
What was your father's
first name?
Ivan.

77
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,800
Ivan? So you are
Anna Ivanovna.

78
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,600
Now come.

79
00:08:57,900 --> 00:08:59,700
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

80
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:03,600
I must stir, I must stir,
or the borscht dies
in my hands.

81
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:06,900
Today, it is family.
Here is my son, Kirill.

82
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:09,300
Hurry, hurry, hurry,
hurry, hurry!

83
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,300
Come, come, come on.
Hurry! Hurry!

84
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,600
More glasses for red
over there.

85
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:26,000
My angels.

86
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:29,900
My angels,
you must practice more.

87
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,000
You know, you must...
You must make
the wood cry. Show me.

88
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:16,800
This is an old card,
from before the renovations.

89
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,500
But if she had worked here,
I would remember her name.

90
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:26,200
Perhaps she ate here once.

91
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,200
Try it. Try.

92
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,400
Try this.

93
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,700
My God, that's amazing.

94
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,800
My dad made borscht
just like that.

95
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,900
Anna, I'm so sorry
I couldn't help.
It is sad.

96
00:11:05,700 --> 00:11:07,700
Very sad.
It's all right.

97
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:11,500
I'll probably
find out more once I get
her diary translated.

98
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,300
Her diary?

99
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:20,300
Yeah. I found it in her bag.

100
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:23,800
Okay, Anna,
this is how it will be.

101
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:27,500
You will bring the diary
and I will translate it
for you.

102
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:30,100
And if we get the names
of any relatives,

103
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
I will call them myself.

104
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:38,300
I can just get my uncle
to translate...
And when you come,

105
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:41,000
I will make you
some more borscht.

106
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:47,000
Like your papa used to make.
So tomorrow?
Shall we say 7:00?

107
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,800
Well, then it's settled.
But, for now,
you must forgive me.

108
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,800
Goodbye, Anna.

109
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:04,800
Anna.

110
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,700
You always work
at Trafalgar Hospital?

111
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:11,100
Yes. Always.

112
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,200
Yeah. That's good.

113
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,500
Nice bike.

114
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,000
Ural.

115
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:47,100
You don't see them anymore.

116
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:49,800
It was my dad's.

117
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,000
How much do you want for it?

118
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,700
It has sentimental value.

119
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,900
"Sentimental value."
I've heard of that.

120
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,600
Not staying for party?
No.

121
00:13:08,500 --> 00:13:09,700
Nor me.

122
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,200
Chauffeurs don't get invited.

123
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:16,600
You want to go
for a drink instead?

124
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:36,700
Anna, how is it
that your boyfriend wasn't
here to carve?

125
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:42,400
I don't live
with Oliver anymore,
Uncle Stepan.

126
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:46,000
I'm living back here
for a bit.
For as long as you want.

127
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:54,900
I knew he would
run away from you.
He didn't run away.

128
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:58,100
Christ, you make me sound
like a burning building.

129
00:13:57,900 --> 00:14:01,000
Black men always run away.
Oh, Stepan!

130
00:14:02,500 --> 00:14:05,700
I'm not allowed to be honest?
He was a doctor, Stepan.

131
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:08,500
What has that got
to do with anything?

132
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,200
It is not natural
to mix race and race.

133
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:23,600
That's why your baby
died inside you.

134
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,600
Oh, shut up, Stepan!

135
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,300
Anna, please...

136
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:32,200
You're just how he was,
stupid, bloody,
drunken Russians.

137
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,800
Hello.

138
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,500
Yeah. It's a panda.

139
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,100
Coast is clear? Yeah? What?

140
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,000
No, not "beach."

141
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:49,200
I said "coast."

142
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,800
It's an English expression,
you fucking baboon.

143
00:15:51,700 --> 00:15:55,700
It means...
It means, there are no police?

144
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,700
You're sure? Good.

145
00:16:03,900 --> 00:16:06,400
No. My father
is not involved.

146
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,900
The driver stays down here.

147
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:28,200
Calm down.

148
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,300
Do you really think
I do this kind of thing?

149
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:35,100
He is not a driver.
He is the undertaker.

150
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,600
Yeah?
Yeah.

151
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:38,300
I don't like him.

152
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:47,000
I have converted
the upstairs rooms
into a private social club.

153
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,200
Some gambling, some drinking,

154
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:53,000
smoking, food, dancing.

155
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:56,300
It has been
the most surprising...

156
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,300
Hey.

157
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:02,000
Hey, Ekrem.

158
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,600
Be calm.

159
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:07,400
Slowly.

160
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:09,900
I got tickets, Azim.

161
00:17:09,902 --> 00:17:11,600
It's with Chelsea.

162
00:17:11,602 --> 00:17:13,000
They said there was
no tickets.

163
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:15,400
But I got tickets
for the Chelsea game.

164
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,900
Okay. Okay, okay.
You go watch DVD now.

165
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,500
Come on.

166
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,100
Azim?
Yeah?

167
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:31,800
He knows to say
he hasn't seen us, right?

168
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:35,400
He don't know anything.

169
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:37,800
He's been touched
by the angels.

170
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,600
Yeah. It's him.

171
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:50,300
He was like a brother
to me.

172
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:55,200
And now, he looks like
a fucking ice cream.

173
00:17:58,700 --> 00:18:03,200
Hey! Show some respect
for a dead man.

174
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,400
Respect?

175
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:14,000
This is respect.

176
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,800
Okay, Kolya,
he's all yours.

177
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:25,400
Show some respect.

178
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
Pederast!

179
00:18:42,600 --> 00:18:44,600
Have you got hair dryer?

180
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:27,200
Have you finished
cutting his hair?

181
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,700
I thought you might want
6.50 from his pocket.

182
00:19:41,900 --> 00:19:43,600
Better burn wallet.

183
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay.

184
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:50,400
Now I'm going to do his teeth
and cut off his fingers.

185
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,600
You might want to leave room.

186
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,700
You too.

187
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:50,000
Wait...

188
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:52,600
Aren't we going to
weight him down or something?

189
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:56,400
No.
If you want to dump body,
this is best place.

190
00:20:56,800 --> 00:21:00,700
This is the best spot
to get rid of a corpse.

191
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,200
Let's go.

192
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,300
One...

193
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,400
Two...

194
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:08,100
Three...

195
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:17,000
The current will keep it down
until past the barrier.

196
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:20,800
<i>I am so excited this morning.</i>

197
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,000
<i>Yesterday a friend came back
to our village</i>

198
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:26,900
<i>and he told us
all about the places
on the map that I look at,</i>

199
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:31,900
<i>Paris, Amsterdam, London.
He's been there for real.</i>

200
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:37,800
<i>He says the future
of everything was already
happening at all those places.</i>

201
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,000
Anna.

202
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:54,600
I wasn't expecting you
so early.

203
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,000
Is that okay?

204
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,000
I copied the whole thing.

205
00:23:02,900 --> 00:23:04,800
Where is the original?

206
00:23:04,800 --> 00:23:06,400
Well, I was
going to keep it.

207
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:09,800
Thought I might give it
to Tatiana's daughter
some day.

208
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:16,200
I will need my spectacles
and a clear head.

209
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,900
Today, I broke my rules
and I drank vodka.

210
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,000
Tomorrow, I will translate it.

211
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,700
And then I will bring
what I've done to your home.

212
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:30,800
Where do you live, Anna?

213
00:23:32,700 --> 00:23:34,000
Not far.

214
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:38,400
But I can just drop by
and pick it up.

215
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:40,700
Or maybe I can drive you home.

216
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:44,100
It's okay.
I've got my bike outside.

217
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:48,200
Come on, Kirill.

218
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:49,500
Get out.

219
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,500
Okay. Okay.

220
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,700
Get up, Kirill.
We're partners now, man.

221
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,800
Yeah, yeah.
You know?

222
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:10,100
Hello.

223
00:24:11,500 --> 00:24:13,100
Hello.
Sorry.

224
00:24:22,600 --> 00:24:24,700
Where's your fucking keys?

225
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:54,700
We went to Kurdish place.

226
00:24:54,700 --> 00:24:57,300
They don't even
celebrate Christmas.

227
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:01,500
Papa! What did I do?

228
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:03,800
Is it Merry Christmas,
or what?

229
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:09,400
I think he's had enough.

230
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:12,500
Who the fuck are you
to tell me, "Enough"?

231
00:25:17,800 --> 00:25:19,800
Papa. Hey, Papa!

232
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:24,300
Papa!

233
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,600
Papa!

234
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,300
Christ!

235
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,400
You've got water in it.

236
00:25:59,300 --> 00:26:01,700
Water?
What makes you think that?

237
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:04,900
Joke.

238
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:18,600
Postmen used these
in my village
when I was a boy.

239
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,700
Russian copy. BMW flat-twin.

240
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:24,900
Same.

241
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:27,700
What?

242
00:26:37,900 --> 00:26:39,100
Please.

243
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,500
Allow me.

244
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,700
Get bus.

245
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:07,800
You have far to go?

246
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,800
Just across the park.

247
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:15,600
I am driver.

248
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:17,400
I even do limousines.

249
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:19,800
Please.

250
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:22,900
If Semyon, my boss, finds out
I let guest walk home
in the rain,

251
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:24,500
he will fire me.

252
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,200
Have you ever met
a girl called Tatiana?

253
00:27:35,500 --> 00:27:38,800
I met a lot of girls
called Tatiana.

254
00:27:38,800 --> 00:27:40,400
She was pregnant.

255
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,900
In that case, no,
I never heard of her.

256
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,300
She died on my shift.

257
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,700
I thought you did birth.

258
00:27:54,500 --> 00:27:57,200
Sometimes birth and death
go together.

259
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,700
She came in
with needle punctures
all over both arms.

260
00:28:04,600 --> 00:28:07,400
Probably a prostitute
at the age of 14.

261
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:13,200
Do you think
Semyon's son knew her?

262
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:16,900
I am driver.

263
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,300
I go left, I go right,
I go straight ahead.
That's it.

264
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,300
You'll take the next right.

265
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:42,300
How much do I owe you?

266
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,700
Christmas present.

267
00:29:14,600 --> 00:29:17,100
Morning, sir.
Morning.
How are you?

268
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:28,700
We think he might
be Russian Mafia.

269
00:29:36,700 --> 00:29:39,700
<i>And he was a member
of vory v zakone.</i>

270
00:29:39,700 --> 00:29:43,400
Stars on his knees means
he'd never kneeled
before anyone.

271
00:29:47,400 --> 00:29:52,300
In Russian prisons
your life story is
written on your body

272
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,700
in tattoos.

273
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:59,500
You don't have tattoos,
you don't exist.

274
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:01,600
This one was a captain.

275
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:07,900
And he's been
professionally processed.

276
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,300
There was something else.

277
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:21,200
It was in his jacket.

278
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,100
Anna?

279
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,700
Yeah?

280
00:30:33,300 --> 00:30:35,000
Stepan, come here.

281
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:39,900
Tell her
what you told me.

282
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:47,000
What? Stepan, what?
I'm late for work.

283
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:53,000
Who gave you that?
It was on the dresser.

284
00:30:53,100 --> 00:30:56,100
Mum, you can't go through
my things.

285
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:58,400
You wanted him
to translate it.
Right and you didn't want to,

286
00:30:58,300 --> 00:31:00,300
so I found someone else.

287
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:05,000
No, Anna.
You don't go to
someone else with this.

288
00:31:06,300 --> 00:31:08,200
You don't go to anyone.

289
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:11,500
<i>Nasilovaniye means rape.</i>

290
00:31:12,500 --> 00:31:15,000
<i>Igla means needle.</i>

291
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:18,300
<i>Prostitutsiya...</i>

292
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:23,500
Perhaps you can guess.
I'm going to wash my hands.

293
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:33,900
Anna,

294
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:36,700
Stepan said that this girl

295
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:40,500
<i>ended up in the hands
of the vory v zakone.</i>

296
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:42,500
Do you know what that means?

297
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:45,200
Look,

298
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,200
if I don't find a relative
in the next few days

299
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:48,800
they're going to put Christine
out for fostering.

300
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:52,200
Once she's in the system,
she'll never get out again.

301
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:55,900
Who named her Christine?

302
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,200
I had to call her something.

303
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,200
Sounds like Christmas.

304
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,900
She's so beautiful.

305
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:15,400
If I can persuade Stepan
to translate it, will you
leave the rest to the police?

306
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:26,300
Tell him I've heard
bad words before.

307
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:19,700
So which one are
we going to fuck?

308
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,000
What do you care?

309
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:23,200
Serious.

310
00:33:25,900 --> 00:33:29,700
Pick one.
Come on.
Let me enjoy myself.

311
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:33,600
Hear me.
You are going to fuck
one of these girls.

312
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:41,000
Okay. Okay.

313
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:46,300
You're going to fuck
one of these girls now!

314
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:49,300
That's an order.

315
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,700
What's the matter with you?

316
00:34:04,800 --> 00:34:08,500
Who are you going to fuck?
Calm down, Kirill.

317
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:10,100
I am recommending you
to my father.

318
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,800
I have to be sure
that you ain't
no fucking queer.

319
00:34:18,200 --> 00:34:20,500
That's enough, Kirill.

320
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,500
Enough?

321
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,300
Siberian ox...

322
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:28,100
<i>You don't tell a vor
what is enough.</i>

323
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:34,600
I'm taking you to
my father's favorite stable.

324
00:34:34,500 --> 00:34:37,900
He comes here himself
because they're all clean.

325
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:42,200
So now I'm going to
watch you fuck
one of these bitches.

326
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:46,800
So you can prove me
that you are no queer.

327
00:34:51,200 --> 00:34:52,400
Psycho.

328
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,800
So, which one is it
going to be?

329
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:03,900
That one.

330
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:12,900
<i>When I was little,
London was like
a place in the Bible.</i>

331
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:15,300
<i>I wasn't even sure
if it was real.</i>

332
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:20,300
<i>My friend has told me
there is a place in London
where they pay girls to sing.</i>

333
00:35:20,300 --> 00:35:24,400
<i>He said if I sang in
this restaurant I would
make more money in a week</i>

334
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,900
<i>than my father would
in a year.</i>

335
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,100
Very nice.

336
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,200
You did it very nice.

337
00:35:50,800 --> 00:35:52,800
Yeah? Really?

338
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:55,600
Thank you, brother.

339
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:02,500
So, if my examination is over,

340
00:36:04,000 --> 00:36:07,000
get the fuck out of here
while I get dressed.

341
00:36:55,500 --> 00:36:57,400
What's your last name?

342
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:02,800
Tell me your last name.

343
00:37:04,300 --> 00:37:05,900
Kirilenko.

344
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:10,000
Where are you from?

345
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:12,000
Ukraine.

346
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,300
Which village? Which town?

347
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:21,300
Irpen.

348
00:37:21,300 --> 00:37:23,200
Outside Kiev.

349
00:37:33,700 --> 00:37:35,800
Stay alive a little longer.

350
00:37:41,700 --> 00:37:43,000
Understand?

351
00:37:55,700 --> 00:37:57,900
<i>My friend said
he would get me to Amsterdam</i>

352
00:37:57,900 --> 00:38:01,400
<i>and from there we could
find a way into London.</i>

353
00:38:01,400 --> 00:38:06,400
<i>I have been practicing
my singing and have even
rejoined the church choir.</i>

354
00:38:06,700 --> 00:38:09,400
<i>I'm also practicing
my English.</i>

355
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:14,500
<i>My friend says his uncle
owns a restaurant
where you can sing.</i>

356
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:17,000
<i>He's sure this man
will take care of me.</i>

357
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:20,400
Let's go to sleep now.
Hello, Anna.

358
00:38:20,400 --> 00:38:22,700
I came on tiptoes.

359
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:28,700
How did you get in here?
There are always open doors,
Anna Ivanovna.

360
00:38:28,700 --> 00:38:31,200
I'm afraid you're not
allowed in here.

361
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:35,000
Please, Anna.
Let me speak.

362
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,400
I translated the diary.

363
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:50,400
I was shocked to discover
that my son, Kirill,

364
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,300
is mentioned many times.

365
00:38:55,300 --> 00:38:58,400
I have known for some years
that he has strayed
from the path

366
00:38:58,400 --> 00:39:00,100
I set out for him.

367
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:13,800
His mother...
His mother died
when he was very young.

368
00:39:16,900 --> 00:39:19,000
What did it say about him?

369
00:39:20,500 --> 00:39:22,400
Many bad things.

370
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,400
But please, Anna,
let me deal with him.

371
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,300
If the diary should
find its way to the police...

372
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:39,300
I mean, some of the things
my son did

373
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,400
are illegal.

374
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:45,600
And he is a good boy.

375
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:49,300
I don't care about him.
I care about the baby.

376
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:51,700
Of course. Of course.

377
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,900
That is the baby.

378
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,400
So sweet.

379
00:40:09,700 --> 00:40:12,300
I have made some enquiries.

380
00:40:12,300 --> 00:40:16,100
I have found out
an address for Tatiana's
family in Russia.

381
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:20,600
That's where
the baby belongs, no?

382
00:40:23,300 --> 00:40:26,300
Perhaps we can do a deal.

383
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,900
Do you understand me?

384
00:40:34,500 --> 00:40:36,800
It's okay.
He was just leaving.

385
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:42,400
So you know where I am,

386
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:46,200
and I know where you are,
Anna Ivanovna.

387
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:53,400
<i>I was thrown down the stairs,
and fell onto some sacks,</i>

388
00:40:53,400 --> 00:40:55,200
<i>like potato sacks.</i>

389
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:57,700
<i>Kirill came down after me...
"Kirill came down after me...</i>

390
00:40:57,700 --> 00:40:59,400
<i>...and he hit me
until I was bleeding.</i>

391
00:40:59,400 --> 00:41:02,400
- "...and he hit me
until I was bleeding.

392
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,400
"Then he tried to rape me
but he couldn't do it.

393
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:13,200
"He just got madder and madder
and kept hitting me.

394
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:17,500
"In the end
his father came down.

395
00:41:18,200 --> 00:41:21,700
"It was the father
who raped me.

396
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,000
"He shouted at his son,

397
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:31,800
"'lf you don't break a horse
it will never
be tame, Kirill.'"

398
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,400
Hello, dear.
How was your night?

399
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:45,200
Stepan's arthritis
is playing up.
I'm taking dictation.

400
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:54,700
Do you want some tea
or something?

401
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:58,700
He came to see me.

402
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:02,800
The man from the restaurant,
he came to the hospital.

403
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:06,100
I told you this!
I told you that...
I know and it's my fault.

404
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,900
It's no one's fault.

405
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,900
I have a friend from Ukraine
who's got a gun...

406
00:42:11,900 --> 00:42:14,800
Stepan!
...from the war
in Afghanistan.

407
00:42:14,800 --> 00:42:17,000
Don't talk about guns.

408
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:24,200
<i>I dealt with the vory v zakone
when I worked for the KGB.</i>

409
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:27,200
You never worked
for the fucking KGB.

410
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,900
I was an auxiliary!

411
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,500
What did this man want?

412
00:42:36,400 --> 00:42:38,200
He wants the diary.

413
00:42:39,600 --> 00:42:43,800
And in return he'll give us
Tatiana's family address.

414
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:49,700
Christine's family.
You cannot do deals
with those people.

415
00:42:49,700 --> 00:42:52,900
This isn't a deal.
It's an exchange
of information.

416
00:42:52,900 --> 00:42:57,700
Have you already forgotten
what I just read to you?
We have to be practical.

417
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:03,000
I think he was threatening
to harm the baby.

418
00:43:03,100 --> 00:43:05,000
Then it's settled.
No!

419
00:43:05,500 --> 00:43:06,700
Stepan!

420
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,400
This isn't our world.

421
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:12,400
We are ordinary people.

422
00:43:17,600 --> 00:43:21,300
She was an ordinary person.

423
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,700
Come here.

424
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:37,100
I've got present for you.

425
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:49,800
From France.

426
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:52,000
Old as fuck!

427
00:43:57,700 --> 00:43:59,500
Here.

428
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:00,900
Open one.

429
00:44:00,900 --> 00:44:03,100
Old is good with wine.

430
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:09,800
Sixty quid a bottle anywhere.
Except I got this for
10 quid a case, man.

431
00:44:10,700 --> 00:44:12,100
From where?

432
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:15,200
From where, you don't ask.

433
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:18,000
Now,

434
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,200
if Papa says okay,

435
00:44:22,300 --> 00:44:25,600
I can start telling you
about the serious stuff.

436
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:28,000
Import, export.

437
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,600
This booze is just like gifts
for Papa's friends.

438
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:35,700
The real import stuff is
from Kabul.

439
00:44:36,500 --> 00:44:38,000
You understand?

440
00:44:40,800 --> 00:44:44,900
Papa! You scared me.
What's wrong?
We're just sampling.

441
00:44:44,800 --> 00:44:46,600
What's wrong?

442
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Your friend Soyka is dead.

443
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,600
Yeah?

444
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:57,100
So what? It has nothing
to do with me.

445
00:44:57,000 --> 00:44:59,600
No, no, no. Don't lie to me.

446
00:44:59,600 --> 00:45:04,100
Papa, believe me.
I said don't lie to me!
Papa. Papa!

447
00:45:04,100 --> 00:45:06,100
Don't lie to me!

448
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:09,800
Kirill. Your dad is right.
No point lying to him.

449
00:45:12,100 --> 00:45:13,900
What are you saying?

450
00:45:13,900 --> 00:45:16,400
Azim's nephew slit
Soyka's throat.

451
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:18,400
Kirill paid him to do it.

452
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:20,700
Shut your fucking mouth!

453
00:45:20,700 --> 00:45:23,500
Your dad always
knows the truth.

454
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:27,800
It's okay, boss.
You don't have to worry.

455
00:45:27,800 --> 00:45:30,000
What? I don't
have to worry?

456
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,600
I got rid of body myself.

457
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,100
Police won't find anything.
My son commits a murder
on my own doorstep.

458
00:45:39,100 --> 00:45:40,900
A fellow soldier.

459
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:43,200
And no one thought
to tell me about it?

460
00:45:43,200 --> 00:45:46,800
<i>Vory v zakone code says,
"Never speak to anybody
about your captain."</i>

461
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:48,600
Kirill is my captain.

462
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,400
When I find out
what happened,

463
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:54,900
we do what we have to,
to clean up situation.

464
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,800
Soyka was spreading lies
about Kirill.

465
00:45:57,800 --> 00:45:59,500
About your family.

466
00:46:01,600 --> 00:46:03,500
It was the right thing.

467
00:46:04,600 --> 00:46:07,800
I decide what's right
and what's wrong.

468
00:46:07,900 --> 00:46:11,500
<i>You do not kill a vor
for no reason.</i>

469
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:18,300
You know as well as I do,
Soyka was talking to police.

470
00:46:20,300 --> 00:46:23,500
For a driver,
you are well-informed.

471
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,500
I have connections
with Chechens exporting cars.

472
00:46:26,600 --> 00:46:31,200
They tell me Soyka speaks
to Russian desk,
Scotland Yard.

473
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,900
Kirill did the right thing.

474
00:46:34,200 --> 00:46:38,100
He did a good thing
for our people.
They will appreciate that.

475
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:41,400
Yeah, Papa! I swear.
Shut up!

476
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,900
If you are so well-informed,

477
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:55,000
you will know Soyka
has brothers.

478
00:46:56,200 --> 00:46:58,500
That's okay.
Kirill has got me.

479
00:46:59,100 --> 00:47:00,400
It's okay?

480
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:04,100
Okay.

481
00:47:09,500 --> 00:47:11,400
Get boxes out of sight.

482
00:47:20,100 --> 00:47:24,400
<i>So you heard him, patsan!
Now you get these boxes
out of sight.</i>

483
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:26,500
Ok, ok.

484
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,300
Here.
Thank you.

485
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,700
How can you eat?
I'm hungry.

486
00:47:52,700 --> 00:47:54,500
That's their driver.

487
00:47:58,300 --> 00:47:59,900
Here he comes.

488
00:48:16,900 --> 00:48:18,800
Meet in public place...

489
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:22,400
Lot of people around.
Very wise.

490
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:28,000
And I see
you bring bodyguards.

491
00:48:28,900 --> 00:48:30,400
Also very wise.

492
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,900
When I was
in the KGB, we knew how to
deal with scum like you.

493
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,300
And you did what there?

494
00:48:36,300 --> 00:48:37,500
Stepan.

495
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,300
Anna?

496
00:49:12,300 --> 00:49:13,400
Okay.

497
00:49:15,000 --> 00:49:16,400
Thank you.

498
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,200
Now, you give me the address.
What address?

499
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:24,500
Tatiana's family.

500
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:29,800
I don't know
what you're talking about.

501
00:49:31,300 --> 00:49:34,300
See? You see?
I told you it would
happen like this.

502
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,800
I told you this.
Anna!

503
00:49:41,700 --> 00:49:44,400
She was 14! Read the diary.

504
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:49,500
She was 14 when he raped her.
You bastards murdered her.
Calm down.

505
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,400
Anger is very dangerous.
Makes people do stupid things.

506
00:49:54,300 --> 00:49:58,200
Please, forget any of this
ever happened.

507
00:49:59,300 --> 00:50:01,700
You're in very wrong place,
Anna Ivanovna.

508
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:04,200
You belong in there
with nice people.

509
00:50:05,700 --> 00:50:08,000
Stay away from people like me.

510
00:50:11,300 --> 00:50:12,600
Devil!

511
00:50:14,500 --> 00:50:16,000
Motherfucker!

512
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,200
Stepan!

513
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:38,200
<i>I'm not sure
I can carry on another day.</i>

514
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:42,300
<i>The windows won't open,
so I can't throw myself out.</i>

515
00:50:43,800 --> 00:50:47,600
<i>They inject me every day
with heroin.</i>

516
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:51,200
<i>Sometimes I think
this is all a hallucination.</i>

517
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:10,800
It's always good to have
someone who I can trust
to do simple tasks.

518
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:16,500
In this business,
sometimes the biggest danger

519
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:20,100
comes from
the most stupid things.

520
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:23,900
You can't afford to
be careless in any area.

521
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:46,900
So, what was the lie
Soyka was spreading
about my son?

522
00:51:47,000 --> 00:51:49,000
It was nothing important.

523
00:51:49,000 --> 00:51:52,300
Kirill had him killed
for nothing important?

524
00:51:55,300 --> 00:51:57,500
I don't like to repeat this.

525
00:51:58,100 --> 00:52:00,900
For me, you will repeat it.

526
00:52:00,900 --> 00:52:04,700
You play with the prince
to do business with the king.

527
00:52:04,700 --> 00:52:08,700
If you want to
do business with me
you must be open with me.

528
00:52:09,500 --> 00:52:11,100
Thieves in law.

529
00:52:14,900 --> 00:52:17,800
So what was Soyka saying
about the prince?

530
00:52:20,900 --> 00:52:22,600
That he's a drunk.

531
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:29,400
And also,

532
00:52:32,500 --> 00:52:33,700
a queer.

533
00:52:42,500 --> 00:52:45,200
My only son.

534
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:53,000
You know,
it never snows in this city.

535
00:52:54,100 --> 00:52:55,700
It's never hot.

536
00:52:57,600 --> 00:53:01,300
London is a city
of whores and queers.

537
00:53:05,000 --> 00:53:08,700
I think London is to blame

538
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,600
for what he is.

539
00:53:12,800 --> 00:53:15,000
Why don't you go home?

540
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:17,600
Cold gets into my bones.

541
00:53:17,600 --> 00:53:22,000
Also, KGB would
be waiting for me.

542
00:53:22,900 --> 00:53:24,000
FSB.

543
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:27,800
They are called FSB now.

544
00:53:27,700 --> 00:53:31,600
Whatever they call them,
they are worse even
than the KGB were.

545
00:53:34,200 --> 00:53:38,000
The midwife said
she had an uncle.

546
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,700
A Russian.

547
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,000
I met him.

548
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,400
So you know
what he looks like.

549
00:53:50,200 --> 00:53:51,400
Yes, yes.

550
00:53:54,600 --> 00:53:56,900
She said he has
read the diary.

551
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:02,800
You cannot trust a Russian
with that kind of information.

552
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,800
Do you understand me?

553
00:54:09,700 --> 00:54:11,200
Yes.

554
00:54:12,300 --> 00:54:16,200
Perhaps you can
deal with him.

555
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:46,500
I thought that
I should bring it back
before it got stolen.

556
00:54:46,500 --> 00:54:48,300
Lot of villains around.

557
00:54:53,600 --> 00:54:56,300
I have address you wanted.

558
00:54:56,300 --> 00:54:59,500
Small village
outside Novokuznetsk.

559
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:01,800
I know it.

560
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,100
Not good place
for kid to grow up.

561
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:09,500
Especially not little girl.

562
00:55:09,500 --> 00:55:13,900
If you want my opinion,
she would be better off
in London.

563
00:55:13,900 --> 00:55:15,700
Maybe with you. Why not?

564
00:55:36,600 --> 00:55:38,600
So you've read the diary?

565
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:45,600
How can you keep doing
what you're doing?

566
00:55:51,500 --> 00:55:53,200
I'm just a driver.

567
00:56:03,000 --> 00:56:05,700
Why'd you bring me this?
I don't know.

568
00:56:06,700 --> 00:56:08,200
I was passing.

569
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,400
Your uncle.

570
00:56:17,000 --> 00:56:19,400
It's true he was in KGB?

571
00:56:19,400 --> 00:56:21,200
I don't know.

572
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,100
Does he live with you?

573
00:56:36,800 --> 00:56:39,500
I fixed it.

574
00:56:39,600 --> 00:56:41,200
Should be okay now.

575
00:57:00,800 --> 00:57:03,000
Hey! Hey!

576
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:09,500
Excuse me.
Just calm down.

577
00:57:11,400 --> 00:57:14,200
Listen to me.
Just calm down, all right?

578
00:57:14,100 --> 00:57:15,600
Take it easy.

579
00:57:19,800 --> 00:57:21,200
Arsenal!

580
00:57:22,900 --> 00:57:24,100
Arsenal!

581
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,400
Wanker!
Arsenal! Arsenal!

582
00:57:31,300 --> 00:57:33,100
Chelsea!

583
00:57:33,000 --> 00:57:37,800
Arsenal!
Wanker!

584
00:57:37,700 --> 00:57:40,700
Arsenal!
Chelsea! Chelsea!

585
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:51,100
Arsenal. Arsenal!

586
00:57:57,700 --> 00:57:59,600
For my brother...

587
00:59:50,800 --> 00:59:53,500
They were going to kill me.

588
00:59:53,500 --> 00:59:56,800
Those Chechens are savages.

589
00:59:56,700 --> 00:59:59,000
What did they say
about my son?

590
01:00:07,900 --> 01:00:09,800
They said

591
01:00:09,800 --> 01:00:12,500
they would spare me

592
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:15,000
only if I delivered
Kirill to them.

593
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:20,700
You are being
very, very honest.

594
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:26,100
I... I fear you
more than I fear them.

595
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:31,600
Never again do business
with any member of my family

596
01:00:32,900 --> 01:00:34,500
behind my back.

597
01:00:35,800 --> 01:00:37,600
Never.

598
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,100
I will never listen
to Kirill again. I swear it.

599
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,100
Do they know

600
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:50,900
where to find Kirill?

601
01:00:51,900 --> 01:00:54,200
They are like wolves.

602
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:57,800
Do they know
what he looks like?

603
01:00:58,500 --> 01:01:00,300
No.

604
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:03,200
They have just arrived
from the mountains.

605
01:01:04,800 --> 01:01:09,400
Tell them you will
deliver Kirill to them.

606
01:01:11,600 --> 01:01:13,200
And tell them

607
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:16,500
to give you two days.

608
01:01:20,400 --> 01:01:21,700
Two days.

609
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:31,200
<i>I know now, for sure,
that I am pregnant.
It hasn't begun to show yet.</i>

610
01:01:31,300 --> 01:01:34,400
<i>After I was raped
they made me take pills.</i>

611
01:01:34,500 --> 01:01:40,100
<i>But I guess it was too late.
I am condemned to give birth
to a new life.</i>

612
01:01:40,200 --> 01:01:44,900
<i>But first,
I will try to find a way
to end my own life</i>

613
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:47,900
<i>and spare this child the pain.</i>

614
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:57,800
What are you doing here?
I don't know.
I was passing.

615
01:02:57,900 --> 01:03:01,300
Well, if you're passing,
just pass.

616
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,900
You keep on going, bitch.

617
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,200
Nikolai, come on.

618
01:03:08,300 --> 01:03:10,000
You should go now.

619
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:14,600
Family's important
to you people, isn't it?

620
01:03:15,300 --> 01:03:16,900
To "you people"?

621
01:03:18,100 --> 01:03:20,500
What's she talking about?
I didn't catch it.

622
01:03:21,500 --> 01:03:22,900
Tell Semyon,

623
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:26,100
the baby I delivered
last Sunday is his daughter.

624
01:03:27,700 --> 01:03:29,300
What did she say?

625
01:03:29,600 --> 01:03:31,900
I don't know.

626
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:37,100
When he raped her,
she was a virgin.
Then they gave her pills.

627
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:39,400
He has to be the father.

628
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:44,100
Kirill! Kirill!

629
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:45,500
Shut up, bitch!

630
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:47,100
Fuck her, Kirill!

631
01:03:47,500 --> 01:03:51,400
Forget her.
She was 14.
She was just a child.

632
01:03:52,500 --> 01:03:55,400
You don't pronounce
the name of my father.

633
01:04:01,000 --> 01:04:03,700
You stop talking shit
about him.

634
01:04:03,700 --> 01:04:07,700
You don't look
at her anymore.
That's an order.

635
01:04:11,900 --> 01:04:14,500
Tell him what I said.
Tell him what?

636
01:04:15,600 --> 01:04:17,700
There is nothing to tell.

637
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:19,800
Slaves give birth to slaves.

638
01:04:21,200 --> 01:04:23,100
Tell him what I said.

639
01:04:23,500 --> 01:04:25,500
Yes, you know,

640
01:04:25,500 --> 01:04:29,600
the girl you fucked
the other day in front of me.
The Ukrainian bitch.

641
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:33,600
Anyway, so,
the police arrives,
some ordinary fucking police.

642
01:04:33,700 --> 01:04:37,000
They just kick down the door
and ask for her by name.

643
01:04:37,200 --> 01:04:38,200
Then they just
take her away.

644
01:04:38,200 --> 01:04:42,700
Like some fucking punter
just might have given them
her name or something?

645
01:04:42,800 --> 01:04:45,800
What gives
the right to the police
to take our women?

646
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:47,200
I don't know.

647
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,800
Fuck police. Hey, Papa.

648
01:04:50,900 --> 01:04:53,200
I've never seen
so many old people
in one place.

649
01:04:53,300 --> 01:04:56,700
Whose party is that?
The angel of death?

650
01:04:57,400 --> 01:04:59,600
She is one hundred years old.

651
01:04:59,600 --> 01:05:01,300
I know.
Kirill,

652
01:05:02,600 --> 01:05:06,600
go down into the cellar
and bring up some brandy.

653
01:05:10,300 --> 01:05:11,900
Twelve bottles.

654
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:15,100
Kolya, you hear that?

655
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,600
Go down in the cellar.
Get 12 bottles of brandy
for Papa.

656
01:05:18,700 --> 01:05:21,100
No, no. He stays here.

657
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:23,000
I want to talk business.

658
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,300
Business?

659
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,800
What business?

660
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:33,600
Papa! What business?

661
01:05:33,600 --> 01:05:35,800
His business is my business.

662
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:39,800
Go to the cellar, Kirill.

663
01:05:39,700 --> 01:05:41,500
And take your time.

664
01:06:01,100 --> 01:06:04,700
So, did you deal with
the old man?

665
01:06:15,000 --> 01:06:17,500
Good. Good.

666
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:21,600
It's time you joined us.

667
01:06:25,100 --> 01:06:26,500
Thank you...

668
01:06:26,600 --> 01:06:27,600
Papa.

669
01:06:28,300 --> 01:06:32,300
<i>You, my dear friend...</i>

670
01:06:32,600 --> 01:06:36,700
<i>... don't think ill of me.</i>

671
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:43,100
<i>In this wilderness...</i>

672
01:06:44,500 --> 01:06:48,000
<i>... simply bury me.</i>

673
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:07,400
My dad swapped
a little girl from Georgia
for this shit.

674
01:07:08,700 --> 01:07:12,600
Don't feel bad for
what happened up there.
It's just how he is.

675
01:07:13,100 --> 01:07:16,500
He plays people
against each other.
That's all.

676
01:07:16,400 --> 01:07:19,200
I understand more and more
how he's like.

677
01:07:21,100 --> 01:07:22,100
Here.

678
01:07:22,800 --> 01:07:26,100
Let's drink to
the little Georgian girl.

679
01:07:34,600 --> 01:07:36,300
I drink alone now?

680
01:08:00,600 --> 01:08:02,400
He offered me stars.

681
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:07,600
I accept.

682
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:54,000
You think
I didn't know already?

683
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:57,700
He told me before.
It was my fucking idea.

684
01:08:59,900 --> 01:09:04,300
He said now
there are a lot of things
I have to teach you.

685
01:09:05,700 --> 01:09:07,600
It will take long time.

686
01:09:08,700 --> 01:09:11,200
I've been protecting you
until now.

687
01:09:12,200 --> 01:09:13,800
Yes, yes, Kirill.

688
01:09:16,300 --> 01:09:17,400
Hey...

689
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:21,300
You think
I don't know things
that you don't know?

690
01:09:21,100 --> 01:09:25,700
<i>I am a vor by birth.
The star's
a fucking birthmark for me!</i>

691
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:27,200
I know.

692
01:09:29,800 --> 01:09:31,600
Don't you forget it.

693
01:09:44,100 --> 01:09:45,700
Where the fuck do you think
you're going?

694
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:48,800
We've got to celebrate.
Come here.
Help me with the bottles.

695
01:09:48,900 --> 01:09:51,500
Your dad don't need
bottles anymore.

696
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,000
Beautiful building...

697
01:10:28,100 --> 01:10:29,500
Good evening.

698
01:10:33,200 --> 01:10:35,400
Is everything ok?

699
01:10:35,800 --> 01:10:37,800
Yes, everything's fine.

700
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:54,600
We can see
that you were in prison
in Siberia...

701
01:10:54,700 --> 01:10:56,900
...and that you were a thief.

702
01:10:57,900 --> 01:11:00,900
My father was
a government worker.

703
01:11:00,900 --> 01:11:03,200
He fixed the cars
of officials.

704
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:07,400
I began by selling
the spare parts
when I was fifteen.

705
01:11:09,100 --> 01:11:11,200
You have no forced tattoos?

706
01:11:11,300 --> 01:11:12,400
None.

707
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,300
You were not cooperative?

708
01:11:17,200 --> 01:11:20,100
I spent two years
in the punishment block.

709
01:11:21,000 --> 01:11:24,100
You went through the Crosses
in St. Petersburg?

710
01:11:24,300 --> 01:11:26,000
I was in solitary confinement
a dozen times.

711
01:11:26,000 --> 01:11:30,000
<i>I was called 'T he Stump'
because they couldn't
shift me.</i>

712
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,500
Your father was a bitch
and a weak fucker for
working for the Government.

713
01:11:35,200 --> 01:11:36,300
Right?

714
01:11:39,000 --> 01:11:40,400
That's right.

715
01:11:40,700 --> 01:11:43,100
He means nothing to me.

716
01:11:43,100 --> 01:11:45,500
My mother...
You have no mother.

717
01:11:45,500 --> 01:11:47,400
She was a whore anyway.

718
01:11:51,000 --> 01:11:52,100
Yes.

719
01:11:58,600 --> 01:12:00,900
I have no mother
and no father.

720
01:12:01,400 --> 01:12:05,600
<i>There is only the code,
the vory v zakone code...</i>

721
01:12:05,700 --> 01:12:08,900
...which I have
always followed.

722
01:12:09,200 --> 01:12:13,600
That is why there is
an empty space
above your heart...

723
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:16,900
...where the stars will go.

724
01:12:17,300 --> 01:12:19,700
And an empty space
on your knees.

725
01:12:22,800 --> 01:12:24,800
I am dead already.

726
01:12:25,000 --> 01:12:31,000
I died when I was fifteen.
Now I live in the zone
all the time.

727
01:13:50,100 --> 01:13:52,500
I tried to
get hold of Stepan.

728
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,400
If he's not at home,
he's usually at his sister's

729
01:13:54,400 --> 01:13:57,500
but she hasn't heard
from him at all.

730
01:13:57,800 --> 01:14:00,400
He did spit in
that awful man's face.

731
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:08,300
I don't think
the driver would do
anything to Stepan.

732
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:09,900
How do you know?

733
01:14:12,600 --> 01:14:15,500
You haven't spoken
to him since, have you?

734
01:14:31,000 --> 01:14:33,300
You're late.
I know.

735
01:14:34,900 --> 01:14:36,100
I'm cold.

736
01:14:39,300 --> 01:14:40,700
Let's go in.

737
01:14:51,200 --> 01:14:55,600
Semyon recommends these places
for business meetings

738
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,800
because you can see
what tattoos a man has.

739
01:15:03,300 --> 01:15:06,900
Come on.
We have a lot to cover.

740
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:10,100
Let's cook.

741
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,800
What you were saying
about Kabul?
Yes.

742
01:15:22,800 --> 01:15:27,700
Our lines to Kabul are broken
every two or three weeks.

743
01:15:28,900 --> 01:15:31,300
Why?
Why?

744
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,000
The Americans.
Fucking NATO.

745
01:15:48,900 --> 01:15:51,500
Valery Nabokov

746
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:56,300
imports flowers
and television sets
into this country.

747
01:15:57,700 --> 01:16:01,200
The television sets are
one in ten.

748
01:16:02,100 --> 01:16:04,000
That means

749
01:16:04,000 --> 01:16:08,900
one in ten have cargo
inside them.

750
01:16:09,100 --> 01:16:11,400
Where do they unload them?

751
01:16:20,200 --> 01:16:24,700
I will tell you
when I return
from the bathroom.

752
01:16:24,500 --> 01:16:27,200
Okay?
Okay.

753
01:16:27,200 --> 01:16:28,300
Yeah.

754
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:32,100
I will be back.

755
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,200
Soon.

756
01:16:36,500 --> 01:16:38,700
"Where do they unload them?"

757
01:17:03,300 --> 01:17:06,000
Kirill is in there...

758
01:17:06,500 --> 01:17:08,700
...there, there.

759
01:17:09,600 --> 01:17:13,700
You will see the stars
there on his chest.

760
01:17:19,000 --> 01:17:20,300
Well done.

761
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,200
Are you okay?

762
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:22,200
Finish him off.

763
01:20:48,300 --> 01:20:49,600
Enough.

764
01:21:48,300 --> 01:21:49,600
My uncle,

765
01:21:52,700 --> 01:21:55,900
the one who spat in your face,
he's disappeared.

766
01:21:56,800 --> 01:22:00,700
If we don't hear
from him soon,
we're going to the police.

767
01:22:00,600 --> 01:22:02,600
Do you know where he is?

768
01:22:05,600 --> 01:22:08,600
Yes. Scotland.

769
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:11,400
Edinburgh.

770
01:22:12,200 --> 01:22:14,100
Five-star hotel.

771
01:22:16,600 --> 01:22:20,300
Edinburgh?
Your uncle knew too much.

772
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:25,900
I was told
to send him to heaven
with bullet in his head.

773
01:22:28,200 --> 01:22:31,700
Instead I sent him
to Edinburgh

774
01:22:31,600 --> 01:22:33,700
with first-class ticket.

775
01:22:38,200 --> 01:22:39,500
He's okay.

776
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:44,800
He's old school,
he understands situation.

777
01:22:45,800 --> 01:22:48,400
Exile or death.

778
01:22:54,100 --> 01:22:58,400
His hotel is called Caledonia.

779
01:23:05,700 --> 01:23:09,200
Hello.
Hi.
Nikolai Luzhin, please.

780
01:23:09,100 --> 01:23:13,700
For that patient, I will need
your security clearance
information, please.

781
01:23:25,900 --> 01:23:27,600
You got my message.

782
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:33,800
Using a dead body
to file a progress report
is original.

783
01:23:33,700 --> 01:23:36,600
It must be against
FSB regulations.

784
01:23:36,500 --> 01:23:40,200
You didn't come here
to give me flowers...
No.

785
01:23:40,800 --> 01:23:43,700
In view of what's
happened to you

786
01:23:43,700 --> 01:23:48,400
and in the light of
other violent incidents
associated with you,

787
01:23:48,300 --> 01:23:49,900
the Russian desk
at Scotland Yard

788
01:23:49,900 --> 01:23:52,400
have made an official request
to the Russian embassy

789
01:23:52,400 --> 01:23:55,900
that your undercover operation
in London be terminated.

790
01:23:58,600 --> 01:24:01,200
You have gone beyond
what was agreed.

791
01:24:02,400 --> 01:24:07,300
If they terminate
operation now
they will be wasting these.

792
01:24:09,300 --> 01:24:14,100
So you tell the Russian desk
you have seen stars
over my heart.

793
01:24:14,900 --> 01:24:17,200
Tell them
I'm through the door.

794
01:24:28,900 --> 01:24:31,600
Tell them I'm going to
replace Semyon

795
01:24:32,000 --> 01:24:34,500
as boss of
London organization.

796
01:24:35,800 --> 01:24:38,600
What drugs are
they giving you?

797
01:24:38,600 --> 01:24:41,000
I need you
to take Semyon
out of the picture.

798
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,600
I want you to arrest him.

799
01:24:43,600 --> 01:24:45,400
Arrest him for what?

800
01:24:45,900 --> 01:24:47,000
Rape.

801
01:24:50,900 --> 01:24:52,700
The girl was 14.

802
01:24:52,600 --> 01:24:56,300
And, of course,
she will testify?
She is dead.

803
01:24:56,100 --> 01:24:58,200
But she had Semyon's baby.

804
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:05,100
If you can prove baby was his
and girl was underage,
that is statutory rape.

805
01:25:05,000 --> 01:25:07,900
You have baby,
you need Semyon's DNA.

806
01:25:09,100 --> 01:25:10,800
For poetic reasons

807
01:25:12,000 --> 01:25:14,200
I suggest you take his blood.

808
01:25:26,300 --> 01:25:29,700
What are you looking at, baby?
You.

809
01:25:32,800 --> 01:25:36,200
What were you and Grandpa
shouting about last night?

810
01:25:40,000 --> 01:25:42,400
Nothing, baby. Nothing.

811
01:25:42,400 --> 01:25:44,400
Sounded like something.

812
01:25:48,100 --> 01:25:51,800
It's just that
someone I know got hurt

813
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,100
so I blamed it on Grandpa.

814
01:25:55,600 --> 01:25:58,500
Did you fight each other?
I heard banging.

815
01:26:01,300 --> 01:26:02,400
No.

816
01:26:06,600 --> 01:26:10,300
It's not a fight
if one of you
doesn't fight back, right?

817
01:26:35,300 --> 01:26:37,100
Maria, go upstairs.

818
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:40,500
Go upstairs, I said.

819
01:26:48,500 --> 01:26:51,200
So, Papa, what did
they want from you?

820
01:26:53,800 --> 01:26:55,300
To poison me.

821
01:26:57,400 --> 01:27:00,600
They took blood from me
with a needle.

822
01:27:01,100 --> 01:27:04,200
Probably the same needle
they use for the junkies

823
01:27:04,300 --> 01:27:06,800
and whores and blacks
and queers.

824
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,400
Now I probably have
the fucking queer disease.

825
01:27:17,700 --> 01:27:20,300
Why would they want
your blood, Papa?

826
01:27:34,700 --> 01:27:36,500
Goodbye.
Good night.

827
01:28:04,000 --> 01:28:06,700
Where have you
taken Christine?
Tell me, you bastard!

828
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:11,300
You've taken her!
He took her, didn't he?
What are you talking about?

829
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:19,200
I saw Kirill. I thought...

830
01:29:15,400 --> 01:29:16,800
Forgive me.

831
01:29:19,100 --> 01:29:20,700
Forgive me, baby.

832
01:29:21,900 --> 01:29:23,400
Sorry.

833
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:46,400
She's just a little girl!

834
01:29:47,900 --> 01:29:51,200
<i>She's just a little
fucking devochka, Papa!</i>

835
01:29:52,600 --> 01:29:53,900
Kirill.

836
01:29:59,100 --> 01:30:00,900
Let me take the baby.

837
01:30:02,900 --> 01:30:05,000
Please, she's cold.

838
01:30:14,000 --> 01:30:15,800
We don't kill babies.

839
01:30:18,200 --> 01:30:20,500
This will be bad for us.

840
01:30:20,500 --> 01:30:22,900
Your father has gone too far.

841
01:30:24,600 --> 01:30:30,700
You're either with him
or with me.

842
01:30:52,500 --> 01:30:57,300
With him or with me.

843
01:30:59,600 --> 01:31:03,200
I swear I didn't know
my Papa was setting you up.

844
01:31:05,200 --> 01:31:06,500
I know.

845
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:09,400
I know, Kirill.

846
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:16,000
Give her to me.

847
01:31:32,800 --> 01:31:34,800
Your father's going away.

848
01:31:34,800 --> 01:31:38,200
The family business
will be yours.
It's our time.

849
01:31:38,600 --> 01:31:40,400
You're the boss now.

850
01:31:42,100 --> 01:31:45,500
You're the boss.
Now we are partners.

851
01:31:47,700 --> 01:31:49,100
That's right.

852
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:53,100
Why don't we go home?
Come on.

853
01:31:54,200 --> 01:31:56,700
I'll take you home.
No.

854
01:31:56,700 --> 01:32:00,700
We're missing
the fucking party of the year!
Happy New Year!

855
01:32:00,600 --> 01:32:01,800
Let's go.

856
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,700
Come on!

857
01:32:04,600 --> 01:32:06,200
That's an order!

858
01:32:09,800 --> 01:32:11,200
You are okay?

859
01:32:12,600 --> 01:32:14,700
I need to know who you are.

860
01:32:17,500 --> 01:32:19,300
Why did you help us?

861
01:32:21,700 --> 01:32:26,100
How can I become king,
if king is still in place?

862
01:32:38,600 --> 01:32:40,800
Bless you.

863
01:33:08,700 --> 01:33:13,000
Goodbye, Anna Ivanovna.

864
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,700
It's okay.

865
01:33:28,700 --> 01:33:30,000
Nikolai!

866
01:34:13,700 --> 01:34:17,300
My little Russian doll...

867
01:34:21,600 --> 01:34:24,000
We're gonna go
and get something.

868
01:34:24,300 --> 01:34:28,800
Should we see Mama?
Should we see Mama?
Yeah. Come on.

869
01:34:29,500 --> 01:34:31,000
Yeah, come on.

870
01:34:32,400 --> 01:34:35,500
Here she is.
There's your Mama.

871
01:34:35,500 --> 01:34:37,700
Here she is,
my little angel.

872
01:34:38,700 --> 01:34:41,100
My muffin.

873
01:34:41,100 --> 01:34:42,600
Are you hungry?

874
01:34:44,800 --> 01:34:46,100
Are you?

875
01:34:53,400 --> 01:34:55,000
Who wants dinner?

876
01:34:57,800 --> 01:34:59,900
<i>My name is Tatiana.</i>

877
01:35:00,700 --> 01:35:04,200
<i>My father died in the mines
in my village,</i>

878
