-What?

might marry and keep themselves

any just cause

I don't expect you to forgive me.

Oh, don't worry, I won't.

I could tell everyone else what I did.

to Mummy and Daddy and Leon...

816
01:39:59,279 --> 01:40:01,531
-So what's stopping you?
-Well, I wanted to see you first.

817
01:40:01,614 --> 01:40:03,825
They don't want to hear any more about it.

in the past, thank you very much.

and throwing you down the stairs.

Of course, you don't.

to think of me inside?

Yes. But yes and no.

-And what's made you so certain now?
-Growing up.

839
01:42:07,447 --> 01:42:08,991
-Growing up?
-I was 13.

840
01:42:09,074 --> 01:42:12,244
How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

841
01:42:12,327 --> 01:42:13,745
What are you, 18?

842
01:42:13,829 --> 01:42:16,707
Do you have to be 18 before
you can bring yourself to own up to a lie?

843
01:42:16,790 --> 01:42:20,877
There are soldiers of 18, old enough
to be left to die by the side of the road,

844
01:42:20,961 --> 01:42:22,379
-did you know that?
-Yes.

845
01:42:22,462 --> 01:42:24,756
Five years ago,
you didn't care about telling the truth.

846
01:42:24,840 --> 01:42:28,176
You, all your family, you just assumed
that for all my education,

847
01:42:28,260 --> 01:42:31,388
I was still little better than a servant.
Still not to be trusted!

848
01:42:31,471 --> 01:42:34,516
Thanks to you, they were able to close ranks
and throw me to the fucking wolves!

849
01:42:34,599 --> 01:42:37,602
-Robbie! Look at me, look at me.
-Don't!

850
01:42:37,686 --> 01:42:41,314
Come back. Come back.

851
01:42:43,859 --> 01:42:46,111
Come back to me.

852
01:43:10,135 --> 01:43:11,219
CECILIA: Briony.

853
01:43:13,096 --> 01:43:14,806
There isn't much time.

854
01:43:16,057 --> 01:43:19,811
Robbie has to report for duty at 6:00,
and he's got a train to catch.

855
01:43:21,479 --> 01:43:22,814
So sit down.

856
01:43:28,736 --> 01:43:31,489
There are some things
you're going to do for us.

857
01:43:48,297 --> 01:43:50,049
You'll go to your parents
as soon as you can,

858
01:43:50,133 --> 01:43:51,509
and you'll tell them everything
they need to know

859
01:43:51,592 --> 01:43:54,637
to be convinced
that the evidence you gave was false.

860
01:43:54,720 --> 01:43:56,389
You'll meet with a solicitor,
make a statement,

861
01:43:56,472 --> 01:43:58,641
have it signed, witnessed,
send copies to us. Is that clear?

862
01:43:58,724 --> 01:43:59,851
Yes.

863
01:43:59,934 --> 01:44:02,770
You'll write a detailed letter to me
explaining everything that happened

864
01:44:02,854 --> 01:44:04,855
leading up to you saying
you saw me by the lake.

865
01:44:04,939 --> 01:44:06,190
Try to include whatever you can remember

866
01:44:06,274 --> 01:44:08,067
of what Danny Hardman was doing
that night.

867
01:44:08,150 --> 01:44:09,402
-Hardman?
-Yes.

868
01:44:12,613 --> 01:44:14,281
It wasn't Danny Hardman.

869
01:44:15,157 --> 01:44:17,159
It was Leon's friend, Marshall.

870
01:44:17,994 --> 01:44:19,078
I don't believe you.

871
01:44:19,161 --> 01:44:22,415
He's married Lola.
I've just come from their wedding.

872
01:44:28,421 --> 01:44:31,090
Lola won't be able to testify
against him now.

873
01:44:31,382 --> 01:44:33,425
(BREATHING DEEPLY)

874
01:44:33,509 --> 01:44:34,927
He's immune.

875
01:44:50,693 --> 01:44:55,447
I'm very, very sorry for the terrible distress
that I have caused.

876
01:44:57,449 --> 01:44:59,702
I am very, very sorry.

877
01:45:00,244 --> 01:45:02,246
ROBBIE: Just do as we've asked of you.

878
01:45:02,621 --> 01:45:07,084
Write it all down, just the truth, no rhymes.
No embellishments, no adjectives.

879
01:45:08,836 --> 01:45:10,587
And then leave us be.

880
01:45:12,506 --> 01:45:13,924
I will, I promise.

881
01:45:23,850 --> 01:45:24,935
(DOOR CLOSING)

882
01:46:16,736 --> 01:46:18,947
BRIONY: I'm sorry.
Could we stop for a moment?

883
01:46:20,323 --> 01:46:21,950
MAN: Of course. Is something the matter?

884
01:46:22,033 --> 01:46:25,286
I just need a couple of minutes by myself.

885
01:46:25,954 --> 01:46:27,580
(TAPE REWINDING)

886
01:46:27,664 --> 01:46:29,499
...minutes by myself.

887
01:46:30,917 --> 01:46:36,297
MAN: Briony Tallis, your new novel,
your twenty-first, is called Atonement. It's...

888
01:46:38,174 --> 01:46:39,259
Briony?

889
01:46:44,472 --> 01:46:46,683
I'm sorry. Could we stop for a moment?

890
01:47:21,926 --> 01:47:26,097
Briony Tallis, I'd like to talk now
about your new novel, Atonement,

891
01:47:26,180 --> 01:47:29,767
which comes out in a few days
to coincide with your birthday.

892
01:47:30,351 --> 01:47:34,772
-It's your twenty-first novel...
-It's my last novel.

893
01:47:36,315 --> 01:47:38,901
Oh, really? Are you retiring?

894
01:47:40,110 --> 01:47:41,445
I'm dying.

895
01:47:43,656 --> 01:47:47,868
My doctor tells me
I have something called vascular dementia,

896
01:47:49,495 --> 01:47:52,581
which is essentially
a continuous series of tiny strokes.

897
01:47:52,665 --> 01:47:58,295
Your brain closes down, gradually
you lose words, you lose your memory,

898
01:47:58,379 --> 01:48:01,423
which for a writer is pretty much the point.

899
01:48:04,259 --> 01:48:08,889
So that's why I could finally write the book,
I think. I had to.

900
01:48:09,723 --> 01:48:12,059
And why, of course, it's my last novel.

901
01:48:15,270 --> 01:48:16,814
Strangely enough,

902
01:48:21,693 --> 01:48:26,031
it would be just as accurate
to call it my first novel.

903
01:48:27,199 --> 01:48:32,412
I wrote several drafts as far back as my time
at St Thomas' Hospital during the War.

904
01:48:33,205 --> 01:48:35,707
I just couldn't ever find the way to do it.

905
01:48:36,500 --> 01:48:38,960
MAN: Because the novel is autobiographical,
is that right?

906
01:48:39,044 --> 01:48:42,547
Yes, entirely. I haven't changed any names,
including my own.

907
01:48:42,631 --> 01:48:44,466
And was that the problem?

908
01:48:45,801 --> 01:48:46,927
No.

909
01:48:47,803 --> 01:48:52,557
I had, for a very long time,
decided to tell the absolute truth.

910
01:48:54,059 --> 01:48:56,228
No rhymes, no embellishments.

911
01:49:05,237 --> 01:49:06,571
And I think...

912
01:49:09,616 --> 01:49:12,243
You've read the book,
you'll understand why.

913
01:49:14,245 --> 01:49:18,500
I got first-hand accounts of all the events
I didn't personally witness,

914
01:49:19,125 --> 01:49:24,089
the conditions in prison,
the evacuation to Dunkirk, everything.

915
01:49:25,590 --> 01:49:28,802
But the effect of all this honesty
was rather pitiless.

916
01:49:28,885 --> 01:49:34,974
You see, I couldn't any longer imagine
what purpose would be served by it.

917
01:49:36,476 --> 01:49:39,062
By what? Sorry. Served by honesty?

918
01:49:39,145 --> 01:49:40,271
By honesty.

919
01:49:41,648 --> 01:49:42,982
Or reality.

920
01:49:48,446 --> 01:49:50,323
Because, in fact,

921
01:49:51,658 --> 01:49:56,371
I was too much of a coward
to go and see my sister in June, 1940.

922
01:49:58,164 --> 01:49:59,957
I never made that journey to Balham.

923
01:50:00,041 --> 01:50:01,709
ROBBIE: Do you have any idea
what it's like in jail?

924
01:50:01,793 --> 01:50:03,836
BRIONY: So the scene in which
I confess to them is imagined.

925
01:50:03,920 --> 01:50:05,046
CECILIA: He sleeps so deeply.

926
01:50:05,129 --> 01:50:06,172
BRIONY: Invented.

927
01:50:06,255 --> 01:50:09,175
ROBBIE: How old do you have to be to know
the difference between right and wrong?

928
01:50:09,258 --> 01:50:11,719
BRIONY: And, in fact,
could never have happened.

929
01:50:11,802 --> 01:50:12,887
Because

930
01:50:15,306 --> 01:50:20,227
Robbie Turner died of septicaemia
at Bray-Dunes

931
01:50:21,354 --> 01:50:23,689
on June the first, 1940,

932
01:50:24,732 --> 01:50:26,817
the last day of the evacuation.

933
01:50:31,697 --> 01:50:32,907
Cheerio, pal.

934
01:51:06,732 --> 01:51:10,778
And I was never able to put things right
with my sister, Cecilia,

935
01:51:12,529 --> 01:51:17,117
because she was killed
on the 15th of October, 1940,

936
01:51:17,451 --> 01:51:21,788
by the bomb that destroyed the gas
and water mains above Balham tube station.

937
01:51:21,872 --> 01:51:23,749
(BOMBS EXPLODING)

938
01:51:58,533 --> 01:51:59,618
So...

939
01:52:02,162 --> 01:52:05,874
My sister and Robbie were never able
to have the time together

940
01:52:07,459 --> 01:52:11,588
they both so longed for, and deserved.

941
01:52:13,381 --> 01:52:16,259
And which, ever since, I've...

942
01:52:21,348 --> 01:52:25,602
Ever since I've always felt I prevented.

943
01:52:32,192 --> 01:52:35,320
But what sense of hope,

944
01:52:36,905 --> 01:52:41,367
or satisfaction, could a reader derive
from an ending like that?

945
01:52:42,202 --> 01:52:48,750
So, in the book, I wanted to give Robbie
and Cecilia what they lost out on in life.

946
01:52:50,126 --> 01:52:55,381
I'd like to think
this isn't weakness or evasion,

947
01:52:58,009 --> 01:53:00,136
but a final act of kindness.

948
01:53:01,929 --> 01:53:08,686
I gave them their happiness.

949
01:53:53,939 --> 01:53:56,692
(BOTH LAUGHING)
