00:02:21,408 --> 00:02:26,408
<i>...from here in London, Financial Times 100 Index up 11 points
just above the key 3800 level.</i>

00:02:26,408 --> 00:02:31,109
<i>As for the rest of Europe, Frankfort's DAX
gaining 9 points to 2532.</i>

00:02:31,109 --> 00:02:35,409
<i>...The CAC market losing 7;
the weaker Franc weighing on the market.</i>

4
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,810
Thank you, Ilsa.

5
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,710
Have a nice day.

6
00:03:06,611 --> 00:03:10,011
<i>If you are on time this morning
according to this...</i>

7
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,411
<i>San Francisco's freeways are...</i>

8
00:03:30,012 --> 00:03:31,712
<i>Well tell me what
we're supposed to do.</i>

9
00:03:31,712 --> 00:03:33,812
<i>I mean you may be perched
on majority shares...</i>

10
00:03:33,812 --> 00:03:36,412
<i>...but we all get fucked
at the actual crash.</i>

11
00:03:37,012 --> 00:03:38,412
<i>That old man is going to sink us.</i>

12
00:03:38,412 --> 00:03:41,713
Soon as I have Baer/Grant's
P and L report in hand...

13
00:03:41,713 --> 00:03:43,913
...I will be speed dialing your number.

14
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:45,112
<i>Is that a promise?</i>

15
00:03:45,112 --> 00:03:47,512
I'm sorry, I'm not aware of that term.

16
00:03:47,512 --> 00:03:51,413
<i>Well what do I do if Anson calls about
substantiation procedure?</i>

17
00:03:51,413 --> 00:03:54,313
Take evasive actions have your
secretary say you're in a meeting

18
00:03:54,313 --> 00:03:55,913
Thank you, Jack.

19
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:57,714
- Yes, Maria.
- Invitations.

20
00:03:57,714 --> 00:03:59,613
- Mm-hmm.
- The museum gala.

21
00:03:59,613 --> 00:04:02,613
- No.
- The Fitswilliam botanical annual fundraiser.

22
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:04,914
- No.
- The Hinchburger wedding.

23
00:04:04,914 --> 00:04:07,914
Hinchburger wedding...

24
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,214
...tuxedos and droning conversations,
I don' t think so, no.

25
00:04:11,214 --> 00:04:13,314
I'll send your regrets.

26
00:04:13,314 --> 00:04:15,014
Honestly why must I bother.

27
00:04:15,014 --> 00:04:16,914
You don't know about society,
Maria.

28
00:04:16,914 --> 00:04:19,815
You don't have the satisfaction
of avoiding it.

29
00:04:20,715 --> 00:04:24,114
- Yes.
- I have an Elizabeth on line 3.

30
00:04:25,514 --> 00:04:27,015
Your ex-wife.

31
00:04:27,115 --> 00:04:28,715
I know who it is.

32
00:04:29,614 --> 00:04:31,115
Take a message.

33
00:04:31,614 --> 00:04:33,915
Oh, happy birthday, sir.

34
00:04:35,015 --> 00:04:36,515
Thank you, Maggie.

35
00:04:39,515 --> 00:04:41,015
I don't like her.

36
00:04:41,015 --> 00:04:44,615
I wouldn't even mention the following,
but he was very insistent.

37
00:04:44,615 --> 00:04:46,816
- It's obviously some sort of prank.
- What?

38
00:04:46,816 --> 00:04:49,116
Well, a gentleman called requesting
to have lunch with you.

39
00:04:49,116 --> 00:04:51,016
I tried to assure him
that you're very busy.

40
00:04:51,016 --> 00:04:54,416
- What's his name?
- A Mr. Seymour Butts.

41
00:04:56,216 --> 00:04:59,817
'Under the Bleachers'
by Seymore Butts.

42
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:01,416
I'm sorry?

43
00:05:02,016 --> 00:05:05,917
Cancel my lunch, make a reservation
to City Club for myself and Mr. Butts.

44
00:05:05,917 --> 00:05:07,516
My usual table.

45
00:05:09,716 --> 00:05:12,417
Maria,
put the reservation under my name.

46
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:20,917
- You ready to order, sir.
- No, I'm still waiting.

47
00:05:20,917 --> 00:05:23,117
This was ice tea?

48
00:05:27,317 --> 00:05:31,118
- Boo!
- Conrad, what a surprise!

49
00:05:31,118 --> 00:05:32,918
Happy birthday, Nickie.

50
00:05:32,918 --> 00:05:36,518
Seymore Butts,
I'll never get tired of that one.

51
00:05:36,518 --> 00:05:39,819
That's why it's a classic.
This is nice restaurant.

52
00:05:39,819 --> 00:05:42,819
- They give me free jacket.
- I'm sure they're gonna want it back.

53
00:05:42,819 --> 00:05:46,019
- I remember being here a long time ago.
- Yeah, I took you here once.

54
00:05:46,019 --> 00:05:48,518
No, I used to buy
crystal-meth off the maitre d'.

55
00:05:48,518 --> 00:05:50,818
- Oh, really?
- In college.

56
00:05:50,818 --> 00:05:52,319
Which college?

57
00:05:52,718 --> 00:05:54,219
Touche.

58
00:05:54,818 --> 00:05:56,319
Miss me?

59
00:05:56,519 --> 00:05:58,519
As much as that's possible.

60
00:05:58,519 --> 00:06:00,519
- You look good.
- So do you.

61
00:06:00,519 --> 00:06:02,119
Think I was worried.

62
00:06:02,519 --> 00:06:03,920
Worried about me?

63
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:07,419
How long has it been since
Mom's funeral? 2-3 years?

64
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,719
- I thought you quit.
- I did. It didn't take.

65
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:14,120
Well, you can't smoke here.

66
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,420
I'm with you.

67
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,920
It's illegal to smoke
in restaurants in California.

68
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,520
Fuck California.

69
00:06:21,921 --> 00:06:23,420
How are you?

70
00:06:23,420 --> 00:06:25,021
Couldn't be better.

71
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,420
Elizabeth?

72
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:29,720
We're divorced, she remarried
a pediatrician or a gynecologist...

73
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:33,221
...or pediatric gynecologist.
Lives in, uh... Sausalito.

74
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:35,121
That's too bad.

75
00:06:35,921 --> 00:06:37,321
I liked her.

76
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:39,221
And what about you?

77
00:06:39,621 --> 00:06:41,321
What, you don't keep track
of me anymore?

78
00:06:41,321 --> 00:06:43,421
Not since family week at rehab.

79
00:06:44,421 --> 00:06:46,321
So what brings you to town Conrad?

80
00:06:46,321 --> 00:06:47,821
Everything all right?

81
00:06:48,022 --> 00:06:49,022
Yeah.

82
00:06:49,022 --> 00:06:50,621
- Need anything?
- Nope.

83
00:06:50,621 --> 00:06:51,621
Really?

84
00:06:51,621 --> 00:06:54,422
No, I don't need anything from you.
I just...

85
00:06:54,422 --> 00:06:56,821
...have myself laying naked
on the beach near Bisa...

86
00:06:56,821 --> 00:06:58,622
...and all the sudden it click.

87
00:06:58,622 --> 00:07:00,122
October 12th...

88
00:07:00,122 --> 00:07:01,722
...Nickie's birthday.

89
00:07:01,923 --> 00:07:03,422
October 11th.

90
00:07:03,622 --> 00:07:05,222
Whatever.

91
00:07:09,923 --> 00:07:10,922
This is for you.

92
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,323
You shouldn't have.

93
00:07:12,722 --> 00:07:15,722
What do you get for the man
who has... everything?

94
00:07:20,323 --> 00:07:24,823
Consumer Recreation Services.
Well, I do have golf clubs.

95
00:07:25,124 --> 00:07:26,723
Call that number.

96
00:07:27,124 --> 00:07:31,224
- Why?
- To make your life... fun.

97
00:07:31,224 --> 00:07:35,424
- Fun?
- You know what that is, that you've seen other people have.

98
00:07:35,424 --> 00:07:37,324
It's an entertainment service.

99
00:07:37,324 --> 00:07:39,024
An escort service?

100
00:07:39,923 --> 00:07:42,424
A profound life experience.

101
00:07:43,624 --> 00:07:47,225
- Sorry, oh, put this napkin...
- No, that's all right, just...

102
00:07:48,624 --> 00:07:50,125
Tell me you'd call.

103
00:07:50,125 --> 00:07:51,624
- I said I would.
- No, you didn't.

104
00:07:54,125 --> 00:07:55,724
You still on medication?

105
00:07:57,525 --> 00:07:58,525
Why would you say that?

106
00:07:58,525 --> 00:07:59,825
You gentlemen ready to order?

107
00:07:59,924 --> 00:08:01,625
I didn't mean it the way it sounded.

108
00:08:01,625 --> 00:08:04,725
I'm not on anything,
I'm not even seeing a shrink...

109
00:08:04,925 --> 00:08:06,225
...and I feel great.

110
00:08:06,225 --> 00:08:07,825
Do you mind?

111
00:08:11,925 --> 00:08:13,925
I think you'll like this
I did.

112
00:08:13,925 --> 00:08:16,226
That was the best thing
that ever happened to me.

113
00:08:16,925 --> 00:08:18,526
I'll call them.

114
00:08:18,526 --> 00:08:19,925
Do it... for you.

115
00:08:19,925 --> 00:08:22,526
I said I'll call, ok?
All right, I'll call.

116
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:26,426
It's just that...
uh... I hate surprises.

117
00:08:26,426 --> 00:08:28,027
I know.

118
00:08:29,626 --> 00:08:36,127
<i># Happy Birthday to you...
Happy Birthday to you...</i>

119
00:08:36,926 --> 00:08:40,927
<i># Happy Birthday, Mr. Van Orton...
- ...Mr. Van Orton...</i>

120
00:08:40,927 --> 00:08:45,227
<i># - Happy Birthday to you.</i>

121
00:08:50,128 --> 00:08:53,528
<i>Someone's got to fly to Seattle and
drive a stake through Anson's heart...</i>

122
00:08:53,528 --> 00:08:57,628
<i>- Have you seen the profitability report?
- You can imagine how much more unhappy I am.</i>

123
00:08:57,628 --> 00:08:59,927
<i>- So you're gonna deal with Anson?
- That's correct.</i>

124
00:08:59,927 --> 00:09:01,428
<i>-We're furious.</i>

125
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,328
<i>-Sleep well, Nicholas.</i>

126
00:09:03,328 --> 00:09:04,928
I will.

127
00:10:04,431 --> 00:10:06,331
Good night, Ilsa.

128
00:10:06,331 --> 00:10:07,232
Dinner's in the oven.

129
00:10:07,232 --> 00:10:11,432
Thank you.
Oh, I saw Conrad today.

130
00:10:11,432 --> 00:10:13,332
Did you? How is he?

131
00:10:13,332 --> 00:10:14,731
He's okay.

132
00:10:14,731 --> 00:10:16,031
I think he's in one of those...

133
00:10:16,031 --> 00:10:18,232
...personal improvement cults or something.

134
00:10:18,232 --> 00:10:21,532
Well, send my love,
if you see him again.

135
00:10:21,532 --> 00:10:23,131
- Happy birthday.
- Good night.

136
00:10:52,234 --> 00:10:55,334
<i>From companies that defaulted
on their payments...</i>

137
00:10:55,334 --> 00:10:59,734
<i>...the FCC expects to receive more than
500 million dollars in bids...</i>

138
00:10:59,734 --> 00:11:02,334
<i>...as the licenses eagerly soar...</i>

139
00:11:02,334 --> 00:11:04,434
Elizabeth, good evening.

140
00:11:04,434 --> 00:11:05,634
<i>Happy birthday, Nickie.</i>

141
00:11:05,634 --> 00:11:07,334
Eleven Forty.

142
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:10,034
You almost missed it this year.

143
00:11:10,034 --> 00:11:11,634
<i>Have you had a nice birthday?</i>

144
00:11:11,634 --> 00:11:14,034
Does Rose Kennedy
have a black dress?

145
00:11:14,335 --> 00:11:17,834
And went not once but twice
through the spanking machine.

146
00:11:18,835 --> 00:11:21,034
<i>Can only imagine.</i>

147
00:11:21,034 --> 00:11:22,535
<i>How are you?</i>

148
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:24,234
Connie asked me
the same thing today.

149
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:25,735
<i>Connie really?</i>

150
00:11:25,735 --> 00:11:27,635
<i>I always liked your brother.</i>

151
00:11:28,835 --> 00:11:30,436
Anyway...

152
00:11:30,436 --> 00:11:31,436
<i>I...</i>

153
00:11:31,436 --> 00:11:34,835
<i>- ...I just thought this might be difficult for you.
- Just another birthday.</i>

154
00:11:36,536 --> 00:11:38,135
<i>Because of your father...</i>

155
00:11:39,035 --> 00:11:41,135
That's right,
he was 48, wasn't he?

156
00:11:41,135 --> 00:11:43,135
I hadn't really thought
about it until now.

157
00:11:44,636 --> 00:11:46,536
<i>Why do I call?</i>

158
00:11:47,736 --> 00:11:49,736
I honestly don' t know...

159
00:11:49,736 --> 00:11:52,537
Please send Dr. Mel
and Rachel my best.

160
00:11:52,836 --> 00:11:54,736
<i>She has a little brother
on the way.</i>

161
00:11:55,236 --> 00:11:56,637
<i>We did the ultra sound.</i>

162
00:11:57,136 --> 00:11:59,236
Offical nuclear family.

163
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,837
You must be very pleased.

164
00:12:01,937 --> 00:12:03,437
<i>We are.</i>

165
00:12:03,437 --> 00:12:05,137
<i>We are very pleased.</i>

166
00:12:05,137 --> 00:12:07,037
Well, it's good to talk with you.

167
00:12:08,137 --> 00:12:09,937
<i>I guess I should let you go.</i>

168
00:12:10,237 --> 00:12:11,737
Take care of yourself.

169
00:12:11,737 --> 00:12:13,637
<i>You, too, Nicholas,
I mean that.</i>

170
00:12:13,637 --> 00:12:16,438
<i>- I really do.
- Uh huh, be well, bye.</i>

171
00:12:17,338 --> 00:12:21,337
<i>A proposal to encourage small businesses
to provide their employees...</i>

172
00:12:21,337 --> 00:12:24,038
<i>...with health insurance
is now being debated...</i>

173
00:12:24,038 --> 00:12:26,038
<i>...by Washington legislators...</i>

174
00:12:26,038 --> 00:12:28,838
<i>...the bill which a type is
a small business help lands...</i>

00:12:28,838 --> 00:12:32,439
<i>...to those of larger corporations
is receiving an initial support...</i>

176
00:12:32,439 --> 00:12:35,138
<i>...from the number of
key Republican leaders.</i>

177
00:12:35,138 --> 00:12:36,739
<i>However Democratic lawmakers...</i>

178
00:12:36,739 --> 00:12:40,038
<i>...are voicing serious concerns about...</i>

179
00:12:40,038 --> 00:12:43,539
<i>...claiming that it would under mine
local officials...</i>

180
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,640
I just wanna make sure
that we understand each other...

181
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:15,840
Once you get it down on paper,
then you can count on my full support.

182
00:13:16,641 --> 00:13:18,541
- We understand.
- Thank you.

183
00:13:18,541 --> 00:13:20,140
We'll talk soon.

184
00:13:57,142 --> 00:13:59,743
Well, you shouldn't feel
this reflects negatively on now.

185
00:13:59,743 --> 00:14:03,242
- I can feel that it was negatively done on me.
- I received this...

186
00:14:03,242 --> 00:14:04,843
Just a moment.

187
00:14:05,643 --> 00:14:07,643
I'm sorry you feel that way.

188
00:14:07,943 --> 00:14:09,243
I understand.

189
00:14:09,243 --> 00:14:11,443
We hope we haven't
caused you any inconvenience.

190
00:14:11,443 --> 00:14:13,743
Thank you for choosing C. R. S.

191
00:14:13,943 --> 00:14:16,443
Mr. Feingold,
could you assist this gentleman?

192
00:14:16,443 --> 00:14:18,243
Oh, yeah... sure.

193
00:14:19,544 --> 00:14:21,644
Jim Feingold,
VP Engineering, Data Analysis.

194
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:24,243
I don't know exactly how this works,
my brother sent me this card as a gift.

195
00:14:24,243 --> 00:14:26,443
Oh, here we go, yeah.

196
00:14:26,443 --> 00:14:28,944
All right, excellent,
well... um, let's get started.

197
00:14:29,244 --> 00:14:33,244
Yeah, I'm sorry about the,
you know all this, hullabaloo here...

198
00:14:33,244 --> 00:14:35,745
We're, uh... well, we're still moving.

199
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,244
You mind holding that?

200
00:14:44,444 --> 00:14:46,145
Thank you very much!

201
00:14:48,845 --> 00:14:50,045
Thank you.

202
00:14:50,045 --> 00:14:53,045
- Are you hungry? New Moon Cafe?
- No, thank you.

203
00:14:59,746 --> 00:15:04,445
Gift from Conrad Van Orton.
Interesting.

204
00:15:04,445 --> 00:15:08,545
- What is?
- Well, your brother was a client with our London branch.

205
00:15:08,545 --> 00:15:10,746
We do a sort of informal scoring...

206
00:15:10,746 --> 00:15:13,146
...and his numbers are outstanding.

207
00:15:13,146 --> 00:15:14,946
Really?

208
00:15:14,946 --> 00:15:17,246
- You sure you're not hungry?
- No, thank you, I'll be fine.

209
00:15:17,246 --> 00:15:20,246
Now need to fill out the...
these forms.

210
00:15:20,246 --> 00:15:21,146
There's an application...

211
00:15:21,146 --> 00:15:22,246
...and then a...

212
00:15:22,246 --> 00:15:25,047
...couple of psych-tests there,
MNPI and PAP...

213
00:15:25,047 --> 00:15:27,346
Oh, uh... for the financial
questionnaire...

214
00:15:27,346 --> 00:15:29,747
...don't answer anything
you don't feel like.

215
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:31,547
We'll run our TRW.

216
00:15:31,547 --> 00:15:35,648
I sometimes hurt small animals,
true or false?

217
00:15:38,047 --> 00:15:40,547
I feel guilty when I masturbate.

218
00:15:40,547 --> 00:15:46,447
Well, I don't write the questions,
I just review the answers.

219
00:15:50,248 --> 00:15:51,848
What is this for?

220
00:15:51,848 --> 00:15:54,048
Well, to give us
an overall sense of your capability.

221
00:15:54,048 --> 00:15:57,248
No, what is this for?
What are you selling?

222
00:15:58,248 --> 00:16:01,649
- Oh, it's a game.
- A game?

223
00:16:01,649 --> 00:16:05,149
Specifically tailored
to each participant.

224
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:08,249
Think of it as a great vacation,
except you don' t go to it...

225
00:16:08,249 --> 00:16:09,648
...it comes to you.

226
00:16:10,049 --> 00:16:12,449
What... what kind of vacation?

227
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,449
It's different every time.

228
00:16:14,449 --> 00:16:16,650
Humor me with specifics.

229
00:16:16,650 --> 00:16:18,249
We provide...

230
00:16:21,349 --> 00:16:22,649
...whatevers lacking.

231
00:16:22,649 --> 00:16:24,549
And what if nothing is lacking?

232
00:16:24,549 --> 00:16:26,150
May I make two suggestions?

233
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,350
You really think that I'll participate
without knowing any...

234
00:16:29,350 --> 00:16:33,950
First, admit to yourself
that it sounds intriguing...

235
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:35,950
...second, you don' t have
to decide today...

236
00:16:35,950 --> 00:16:38,150
Take the silly test
fill out the stupid forms...

237
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:42,851
...one day your game begins,
you either love it or hate it, decide then.

238
00:16:43,450 --> 00:16:45,650
You know we... we are like...

239
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:49,451
...an experiential Book-of-the-Month-Club.

240
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:53,051
You can drop out at any time
with no further obligations.

241
00:16:55,051 --> 00:16:56,651
That was my sales pitch.

242
00:16:57,852 --> 00:16:59,351
How long will this take?

243
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:01,752
About an hour for those,
another hour for the physical.

244
00:17:01,952 --> 00:17:04,251
- Physical?
- It's a cursory examination...

245
00:17:04,251 --> 00:17:07,152
...turn-your-head-caugh sort of thing,
you'll be out of here in no time.

246
00:17:57,054 --> 00:17:58,554
Confused.

247
00:18:04,155 --> 00:18:05,754
Risky.

248
00:18:09,155 --> 00:18:10,754
Bloody.

249
00:18:15,055 --> 00:18:16,655
Oops.

250
00:18:36,356 --> 00:18:40,256
<i>- Mr. Sutherland called about the Baer/Grant Publishing.
- Cancel it, push it back to Wednesday.</i>

251
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:43,057
<i>- Grants say they'll go back tomorrow.
- Tomorrow?</i>

252
00:18:43,057 --> 00:18:43,957
Yes.

253
00:18:43,957 --> 00:18:45,556
How much longer
is this going to take?

254
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,556
Shouldn't be long, we're almost done.

255
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,357
You said that two hours ago

256
00:18:49,357 --> 00:18:51,157
<i>- All right, put it back until tomorrow.
- ...selection...</i>

257
00:18:51,157 --> 00:18:53,357
<i>...before the following emotional responses.</i>

258
00:18:53,357 --> 00:18:57,357
<i>You have 0.9 seconds to
continue. Your emotional...</i>

259
00:18:57,357 --> 00:18:59,257
<i>...reaction time for the factor...</i>

260
00:19:02,058 --> 00:19:05,058
<i>Would you make a selection
before the following emotional responses.</i>

261
00:19:05,058 --> 00:19:07,457
<i>You have 0.9 seconds to continue.</i>

262
00:19:11,757 --> 00:19:13,458
Is this thing end?

263
00:19:29,259 --> 00:19:30,459
I'm sorry to keep you here waiting.

264
00:19:30,459 --> 00:19:34,959
Well, don't worry, it's been just terrific
spending my entire day with your guarantee.

265
00:19:34,959 --> 00:19:36,759
Well, it's all down to this.

266
00:19:36,759 --> 00:19:39,259
This is an insurance company requirement,
it states that you're aware...

267
00:19:39,259 --> 00:19:42,659
...that the game exists and that you're
willing to participate in said game...

268
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:45,160
...so on and so forth our guarantee
that the payment's entirely...

269
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:48,659
...at your brother's discretion as a gift
it's dependent on your satisfaction.

270
00:19:48,659 --> 00:19:50,960
Does that mean that if I'm not happy,
he doesn't have to pay?

271
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,560
That's never happened,
we've never had an unsatisfied customer.

272
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,560
I think you mean dissatisfied.

273
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,959
That's right, your
left-brain word fetishist.

274
00:19:57,959 --> 00:20:00,760
Initials, initials
and you sign there.

275
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:01,961
...in blood.

276
00:20:02,061 --> 00:20:03,560
Just kidding.

277
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:08,560
All right, now your copy will be
at the front desk in this folder.

278
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:10,660
And I'll... keep the pen.

279
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,261
We'll let you know.

280
00:20:15,661 --> 00:20:18,361
<i>- What about Monday or Tuesday?
- No, that's bad for me.</i>

281
00:20:18,361 --> 00:20:22,561
<i>- Well, how about tonight?
- Well, I'm working all this evening.</i>

282
00:20:22,561 --> 00:20:25,461
<i>Wednesday is the only possibility
right now.</i>

283
00:20:25,461 --> 00:20:28,162
<i>- Do you wanna do dinner?
- Okay.</i>

284
00:20:28,162 --> 00:20:31,462
<i>By the way, I went to C. R. S.</i>

285
00:20:31,462 --> 00:20:33,662
<i>Really? What did you think?</i>

286
00:20:33,662 --> 00:20:36,462
<i>Well, they seemed just
a little bit disorganized.</i>

287
00:20:36,862 --> 00:20:39,762
<i>Well, when I did it in London,
they've been around a while.</i>

288
00:20:39,762 --> 00:20:41,063
<i>Are you gonna do this?</i>

289
00:20:41,063 --> 00:20:42,962
<i>No, I haven't decided yet.</i>

290
00:20:46,063 --> 00:20:48,263
...telling you it's the way
to getting in on the ground floor...

291
00:20:48,263 --> 00:20:50,063
...for the next Disneyland.

292
00:20:50,063 --> 00:20:54,063
C. R. S. won' t go public,
their family owned.

293
00:20:54,063 --> 00:20:55,763
Stranger things have happened.

294
00:20:55,763 --> 00:20:57,763
No, they haven't actually.

295
00:20:58,763 --> 00:20:59,963
They opened here.

296
00:20:59,963 --> 00:21:01,763
"The game" in San Francisco?

297
00:21:02,263 --> 00:21:04,763
See?
They're doing fine without any of us.

298
00:21:10,863 --> 00:21:13,064
- How are you, James? Good evening.
- Good evening, sir.

299
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,564
Get new members here?

300
00:21:15,264 --> 00:21:16,564
Believe so, sir.

301
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:18,664
Put the next round on me.

302
00:21:18,664 --> 00:21:20,164
Got you, sir.

303
00:21:23,165 --> 00:21:24,664
No, no, no.

304
00:21:24,664 --> 00:21:28,464
Last time I played Pebble, I swore
I'd never pick up another club again.

305
00:21:29,864 --> 00:21:31,764
Speaking about games...

306
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:35,165
...couldn't help to overhear you
talking about C. R. S..

307
00:21:37,165 --> 00:21:38,865
Well, the reason I mentioned is...

308
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,865
I took the test today
the Montgomery street office.

309
00:21:41,865 --> 00:21:44,065
You did? Kudos.

310
00:21:44,065 --> 00:21:46,065
So, yours hasn't started yet?

311
00:21:46,065 --> 00:21:49,865
No, not yet, that was one of
the questions I had for you.

312
00:21:50,466 --> 00:21:52,566
- What is it?
- Oh, what is it?

313
00:21:52,566 --> 00:21:54,566
The eternal question.

314
00:21:54,566 --> 00:21:56,366
You know I envy you.

315
00:21:56,366 --> 00:22:00,966
I wish I could go back and do it
for the first time all over again.

316
00:22:03,066 --> 00:22:06,666
Here's to... new experiences.

317
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,267
Hmm, if you'll excuse me,
I got to go.

318
00:22:12,267 --> 00:22:13,966
Good night, Ted.

319
00:22:13,966 --> 00:22:15,966
- Nicholas...
- Nice to meet you.

320
00:22:19,567 --> 00:22:21,267
So, you played recently?

321
00:22:21,267 --> 00:22:23,567
Oh, about a year ago.

322
00:22:23,567 --> 00:22:26,567
I was working in Los Angeles.

323
00:22:26,567 --> 00:22:29,368
Oh, I heard the London office
is very good too...

324
00:22:29,368 --> 00:22:33,268
It sounds like lot of
fantasy role playing nonsense, though.

325
00:22:35,168 --> 00:22:36,768
You wanna know what it is?

326
00:22:37,668 --> 00:22:38,968
What it's all about?

327
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:43,169
John, chapter 9, verse 25.

328
00:22:43,468 --> 00:22:45,068
I, um...

329
00:22:45,068 --> 00:22:49,568
- ...haven't been to Sunday school in a long time.
- Whereas once I was blind...

330
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:51,168
...now I can see.

331
00:22:53,369 --> 00:22:55,469
Good night, Nicholas.

332
00:22:55,469 --> 00:22:56,869
Best of luck.

333
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:58,969
Good night.

334
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:16,670
If the Baer/Grant meeting...

335
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:19,970
...is not held tomorrow...

336
00:23:19,970 --> 00:23:21,970
...may as well not be held at all.

337
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:27,570
When Mr. Van Orton boards
his plane on the morrow...

338
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:31,770
...he'll have every agreement and
addendum in the complete closing package...

339
00:23:31,770 --> 00:23:33,371
...flawlessly revised.

340
00:23:33,371 --> 00:23:36,671
So you will miss another opera
you would of have slept during anyway.

341
00:23:36,871 --> 00:23:39,371
We now have an opportunity
to show our clients...

342
00:23:39,371 --> 00:23:42,471
...how well we will rise
to his exhilarating challenge.

343
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:47,071
<i>- Yes?
- Nicholas Van Orton?</i>

344
00:23:47,071 --> 00:23:49,771
<i>- Who is this?
- This is Cynthia from C. R. S.</i>

345
00:23:49,771 --> 00:23:52,771
<i>- How did you get this number?
- We've finished processing your...</i>

346
00:23:52,771 --> 00:23:56,272
<i>- Look, I'm in a meeting right now.
- I'm afraid it was rejected.</i>

347
00:23:57,171 --> 00:23:59,972
<i>- I beg your pardon?
- You shouldn't feel this reflects negatively on you...</i>

348
00:23:59,972 --> 00:24:01,672
<i>...we hope we haven' t
caused you any inconvenience.</i>

349
00:24:01,672 --> 00:24:04,472
<i>- Uh, this is ridiculous.
- Thank you for speaking to C.R.S.</i>

350
00:24:06,072 --> 00:24:07,772
Anything wrong?

351
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:09,672
Uh... no, no, nothing's...

352
00:24:11,972 --> 00:24:15,272
<i>...you may hang up
or press tab for more options.</i>

353
00:24:15,272 --> 00:24:18,973
<i>Oh, this is Conrad.
Leave a message.</i>

354
00:24:18,973 --> 00:24:23,373
Yes, Connie it's Nicholas,
give me a ring when you get in.

355
00:24:23,373 --> 00:24:28,973
Oh, uh... regarding your birthday present...
um... things are a little crazy right now.

356
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:30,673
I don't even know if I can
fit it in my schedule.

357
00:24:30,673 --> 00:24:33,374
But we'll talk about it
at dinner tomorrow.

358
00:24:33,374 --> 00:24:34,873
Thanks, bye.

359
00:25:07,275 --> 00:25:08,675
Hello...

360
00:26:09,479 --> 00:26:12,479
<i>...the resulting rise
of unemployment are decline...</i>

361
00:26:12,479 --> 00:26:14,779
<i>...into buyable small businesses.</i>

362
00:26:14,779 --> 00:26:16,579
<i>Meanwhile Republican leaders argue...</i>

363
00:26:16,579 --> 00:26:18,979
<i>...that this passage would be
the very stimulant...</i>

364
00:26:18,979 --> 00:26:21,579
<i>...that a sluggish economy needs.</i>

365
00:26:21,579 --> 00:26:22,979
<i>No one has expressed an opinion...</i>

366
00:26:22,979 --> 00:26:27,579
<i>...as to how it will impact on
pampered existence of Nicholas Van Orton.</i>

367
00:26:27,579 --> 00:26:30,979
<i>For one thing on which both
Democrats and Republicans seem to agree...</i>

368
00:26:30,979 --> 00:26:35,480
<i>...is that most Americans have a serious
doubts about the Economic future.</i>

369
00:26:35,480 --> 00:26:40,279
<i>A recent poll suggests that a staggering
57% of American workers believe...</i>

370
00:26:40,279 --> 00:26:43,279
<i>...there is a very real chance
they will be unemployed...</i>

371
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:46,280
<i>...within the next 5 to 7 years.</i>

372
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:51,280
<i>But what does that matter to
a bloated millionaire fat cat like you?</i>

373
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:54,380
<i>And now for financial news.
Stock markets rose both domestically...</i>

374
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:56,781
<i>...and abroad today
after the announcement of...</i>

375
00:26:56,781 --> 00:27:00,180
<i>...stronger than expected earnings
by several high tech companies...</i>

376
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:05,581
<i>...but dipped again reacting to report
Nicholas Van Orton has sneezed.</i>

377
00:27:07,981 --> 00:27:11,582
<i>Are you gonna spend the rest of
the evening prying at that clown' s mouth?</i>

378
00:27:13,181 --> 00:27:14,281
I... I... I don' t...

379
00:27:14,281 --> 00:27:17,481
<i>It's frustrating for me
if you don't pay attention.</i>

380
00:27:18,982 --> 00:27:20,481
What is this?

381
00:27:21,281 --> 00:27:25,082
<i>This is your game, Nicholas
and welcome to it.</i>

382
00:27:25,982 --> 00:27:28,982
<i>I'm here to let you in
on a few ground rules.</i>

383
00:27:29,582 --> 00:27:32,982
<i>You received the very first key
and others will follow.</i>

384
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:36,583
<i>You'll never know where you'll find them
or how you'll need to use it.</i>

385
00:27:36,583 --> 00:27:38,683
<i>So keep your eyes open.</i>

386
00:27:38,983 --> 00:27:40,983
How do you...
You can see me?

387
00:27:40,983 --> 00:27:43,482
<i>Let us save the questions to afterwards.</i>

388
00:27:45,683 --> 00:27:47,283
How does this work?

389
00:27:49,283 --> 00:27:51,783
<i>There's a tiny camera
looking at you...</i>

390
00:27:51,783 --> 00:27:53,283
<i>...right now.</i>

391
00:27:54,283 --> 00:27:55,483
It's impossible.

392
00:27:55,483 --> 00:27:57,884
<i>You're right, impossible.</i>

393
00:27:57,884 --> 00:28:00,084
<i>You're having a conversation
with your television.</i>

394
00:28:03,483 --> 00:28:05,483
<i>It's miniaturized.</i>

395
00:28:08,184 --> 00:28:09,984
<i>You know how dangerous that is?</i>

396
00:28:15,384 --> 00:28:18,184
<i>- Mr. Van Orton?
- ...and in domestic news, sunny California...</i>

397
00:28:18,184 --> 00:28:19,985
Yes, Ilsa, what is it?

398
00:28:19,985 --> 00:28:22,584
- Is everything all right?
- Fine.

399
00:28:22,685 --> 00:28:25,584
<i>...in the petroleum processing
plant yesterday...</i>

400
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,485
<i>- I finished for the evening, will you be needing anything else?
- ...in sunny California...</i>

401
00:28:28,485 --> 00:28:30,985
No, I won't, Ilsa, thank you.
Good night.

402
00:28:30,985 --> 00:28:33,385
<i>- Good night, then.
- ...under control of major that broke out...</i>

403
00:28:33,385 --> 00:28:36,485
<i>...in a petroleum processing
plant yesterday...</i>

404
00:28:36,485 --> 00:28:38,085
<i>Several weeks...</i>

405
00:28:38,085 --> 00:28:41,086
<i>- Who was that?
- Never mind who that is.</i>

406
00:28:41,086 --> 00:28:44,585
<i>- You wanna know how a camera got into you home, don't you?
- Yes, I would.</i>

407
00:28:52,687 --> 00:28:54,286
<i>Cold.</i>

408
00:28:55,887 --> 00:28:57,386
<i>Co... colder.</i>

409
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:02,787
<i>Wa... wa... warm.</i>

410
00:29:07,187 --> 00:29:08,787
<i>Warmer.</i>

411
00:29:24,387 --> 00:29:26,188
<i>Write this number down.</i>

412
00:29:26,188 --> 00:29:29,687
<i>It's a 24 hour
Consumer Recreation Services hotline.</i>

413
00:29:29,687 --> 00:29:31,288
<i>For emergencies only.</i>

414
00:29:31,288 --> 00:29:34,088
<i>But don't call asking
what the object of the game is...</i>

415
00:29:34,088 --> 00:29:35,388
<i>...figuring that out...</i>

416
00:29:35,388 --> 00:29:37,488
<i>...is the object of the game.</i>

417
00:29:37,989 --> 00:29:40,188
<i>Good luck and
congratulations on choosing...</i>

418
00:29:40,188 --> 00:29:42,388
<i>C... R... S...</i>

419
00:29:42,388 --> 00:29:45,989
<i>Great to have the American ambassador
expelled after the incident.</i>

420
00:29:45,989 --> 00:29:49,789
<i>Who the State Department responded
quickly with a forward apology.</i>

421
00:29:49,789 --> 00:29:53,089
<i>An announcement with the ambassadors
will be immediate voluntary...</i>

422
00:31:50,794 --> 00:31:52,595
May I help you?

423
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:58,095
What is it?

424
00:32:01,996 --> 00:32:03,595
What?

425
00:32:11,996 --> 00:32:13,596
Thank you.

426
00:32:27,097 --> 00:32:28,596
Buddy?

427
00:32:30,597 --> 00:32:32,197
Can you help me out?

428
00:32:34,397 --> 00:32:36,597
I need some toilet paper.
I ran out.

429
00:32:38,897 --> 00:32:41,497
Just... just go out to the next stall.

430
00:32:44,098 --> 00:32:45,497
Come on, help me out.

431
00:32:46,897 --> 00:32:48,398
Hello?

432
00:32:49,598 --> 00:32:51,098
Hello?

433
00:32:56,098 --> 00:32:57,598
Didn't expect to see you here.

434
00:32:57,898 --> 00:32:59,598
I wanted to wish you luck.

435
00:32:59,598 --> 00:33:00,999
Been up all night?

436
00:33:00,999 --> 00:33:01,999
I checked it...

437
00:33:01,999 --> 00:33:02,999
...personally.

438
00:33:02,999 --> 00:33:05,299
I appreciate that, Sam.
Why don't you go home and get some sleep?

439
00:33:05,299 --> 00:33:07,698
- You're sure you don't want me along?
- No, I'll be fine.

440
00:33:07,998 --> 00:33:10,599
Hmm, nice shirt.

441
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,998
Don't ask.

442
00:33:11,998 --> 00:33:13,599
Cio!

443
00:33:38,500 --> 00:33:40,200
All of these years...

444
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:43,900
...the first time ever
you stepped forward in these offices...

445
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:45,900
...it's to ask me to step down.

446
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,101
You promised to meet
the projections, Anson...

447
00:33:48,101 --> 00:33:50,900
...a dollar sixty per shares is
what you said.

448
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:53,601
I don't think
this visit comes as a surprise.

449
00:33:54,101 --> 00:33:57,201
- Projections were far too optimistic
- Admittedly, yes.

450
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:59,601
Our E.P.S. was 150 last quarter,
we're up 8 cents.

451
00:33:59,601 --> 00:34:04,001
The expectations were 10 and this
case the expectations meant everything

452
00:34:04,401 --> 00:34:07,402
Will you really hold me to
it over pennies?

453
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,502
My stock is falling,
I don' t know about yours...

454
00:34:09,502 --> 00:34:11,702
...those pennies are costing millions.

455
00:34:11,702 --> 00:34:14,502
Give me... give me next quarter.

456
00:34:14,502 --> 00:34:16,302
If you still feel this way,
vote your shares.

457
00:34:16,302 --> 00:34:18,202
Today is what counts, Anson.

458
00:34:21,502 --> 00:34:26,303
You...
you intractable son of bitch.

459
00:34:26,303 --> 00:34:28,203
Your father could see you know.

460
00:34:28,602 --> 00:34:31,102
- What?
- Your father was a friend.

461
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:33,303
You're friends! God damn it,
I've watched you grew up.

462
00:34:33,303 --> 00:34:37,403
Because you went fishing with my father,
I should sit on my hands...

463
00:34:37,403 --> 00:34:39,403
- ...while you're throwing my money away?
- I...

464
00:34:39,403 --> 00:34:41,403
I'm not finished.

465
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:44,503
You misspoke before
when you said you're stepping down.

466
00:34:45,603 --> 00:34:48,304
I am firing you.

467
00:34:48,304 --> 00:34:51,304
Action is taken,
confidence is restored...

468
00:34:52,103 --> 00:34:53,204
The stock goes up.

469
00:34:53,204 --> 00:34:54,103
No.

470
00:34:54,103 --> 00:34:57,304
There's no Baer/Grant Publishing...

471
00:34:57,304 --> 00:35:01,004
...no Baer/Grant Publishing
without...

472
00:35:01,004 --> 00:35:02,404
...Anson Baer.

473
00:35:02,404 --> 00:35:05,004
Where's Stewart Grant?
He's probably out there sailing...

474
00:35:05,004 --> 00:35:08,505
...and enjoying his golden years,
wondering where the hell you are, Anson.

475
00:35:09,804 --> 00:35:11,405
I'm sorry...

476
00:35:12,004 --> 00:35:13,605
...you failed.

477
00:35:17,705 --> 00:35:22,005
I have prepared severance package
that is more than...

478
00:35:22,005 --> 00:35:23,605
...equitable.

479
00:35:24,105 --> 00:35:25,605
Valid until...

480
00:35:25,605 --> 00:35:27,206
...this evening.

481
00:35:29,005 --> 00:35:30,805
I could fight you with this.

482
00:35:31,506 --> 00:35:34,306
If I leave without your signature...

483
00:35:34,306 --> 00:35:36,506
...this agreement begins to disintegrate...

484
00:35:37,506 --> 00:35:40,205
...and if it's shrink, options narrow...

485
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,506
...and your compensation will be shriveled.

486
00:35:49,407 --> 00:35:51,206
Think it's in your...

487
00:35:51,206 --> 00:35:53,307
...best interest, Anson.

488
00:36:09,107 --> 00:36:11,608
Well, I guess this is your...

489
00:36:11,608 --> 00:36:13,207
...lucky day.

490
00:36:14,508 --> 00:36:16,708
My lawyers will be
in touch with you.

491
00:36:50,109 --> 00:36:52,909
Excuse me,
has Conrad Van Orton left a message?

492
00:36:52,909 --> 00:36:55,610
- I'll check on it right away, Mr. Van Orton.
- Thank you.

493
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,810
- Oh, I'm so sorry. Here.
- Please, don't do that.

494
00:37:06,810 --> 00:37:08,910
I'm so sorry, I wasn't even looking.

495
00:37:09,310 --> 00:37:10,711
I'm really having a bad day.

496
00:37:10,711 --> 00:37:12,110
How about a bad month?

497
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:15,411
You did almost exactly the same
thing to me when I was here last week.

498
00:37:15,411 --> 00:37:16,310
Here.

499
00:37:16,310 --> 00:37:20,711
Don't do that. Just get me some... uh...
some napkins and... uh... some soda water.

500
00:37:20,711 --> 00:37:22,811
Looks like the... uh...

501
00:37:22,811 --> 00:37:24,711
...cleaning's gonna mean
more than the suit.

502
00:37:25,711 --> 00:37:27,111
I don't think so.

503
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:30,712
- It was an accident, sir.
- Terrific.

504
00:37:31,011 --> 00:37:32,612
I said I was sorry.

505
00:37:36,311 --> 00:37:37,412
Asshole.

506
00:37:37,412 --> 00:37:38,612
Cristine!

507
00:37:38,612 --> 00:37:40,311
Mr. Van Orton is a valued customer.

508
00:37:40,311 --> 00:37:42,612
Fine, then you kiss his ass.

509
00:37:42,612 --> 00:37:43,812
Don't you talk to me like that.

510
00:37:43,812 --> 00:37:46,513
I apologized, I offered to help,
what do you want me to do?

511
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:48,012
Clean out your locker.

512
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,812
- What?
- You heard me.

513
00:37:53,312 --> 00:37:55,613
I'm terribly sorry, Mr. Van Orton.

514
00:37:55,613 --> 00:37:56,913
If you're not too uncomfortable...

515
00:37:56,913 --> 00:37:59,113
...will this table suit you
for complimentary meal?

516
00:37:59,113 --> 00:38:00,613
Be fine.

517
00:38:08,614 --> 00:38:10,614
- I'll fetch your waiter.
- Thank you.

518
00:38:12,213 --> 00:38:13,814
Check, sir.

519
00:38:38,115 --> 00:38:42,215
- Miss, pardon me, miss?
- Oh, great, it's you.

520
00:38:42,215 --> 00:38:46,516
I don't know how this works,
but you have something for me.

521
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:48,115
I... uh...

522
00:38:49,215 --> 00:38:53,015
- I received this note.
- What're you about? Babbling about psycho?

523
00:38:53,015 --> 00:38:55,015
I need to know
what is going on.

524
00:38:55,015 --> 00:38:58,116
You wanna know whats going on?
I'm going on my second job this month now.

525
00:38:58,116 --> 00:39:00,016
Looks like I'm going on unemployment.

526
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:05,216
- Maybe I should try to explain.
- Don't explain, just fuck off.

527
00:39:08,416 --> 00:39:10,316
Son of a bitch!

528
00:39:10,316 --> 00:39:14,216
I am... I'm trying to...
I'm apologizing... I...

529
00:39:26,417 --> 00:39:28,518
Jesus, what is this?

530
00:39:32,217 --> 00:39:35,017
- What's with him?
- I don't know, he just he fell down.

531
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:36,317
Can you hear me?

532
00:39:36,317 --> 00:39:38,918
- Do you know what to do?
- I don't even know if he's breathing.

533
00:39:40,818 --> 00:39:42,417
Move your head.

534
00:39:42,718 --> 00:39:44,718
Don't stand there, get help.

535
00:39:45,517 --> 00:39:47,718
Hey, hey, it's ok.

536
00:39:50,018 --> 00:39:52,018
How do we know he's real?

537
00:39:52,018 --> 00:39:54,619
He's pissing his pants, mister.
Is that real enough for you?

538
00:39:55,619 --> 00:39:57,619
Help me, God!

539
00:39:57,619 --> 00:39:59,019
He's turning blue.

540
00:40:00,119 --> 00:40:01,919
Police! Police!

541
00:40:12,919 --> 00:40:14,720
You will have to fill this forms out.

542
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:15,920
I don't know this man.

543
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,120
- Here, what do you need.
- Can't get involved in this.

544
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,120
- Hey, I might have to detain you.
- Detain me?

545
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,320
- The reports gotta be filled out.
- She can do the reports.

546
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,120
Ride with your wife.
We'll meet at the hospital.

547
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:27,120
- The hospital?
- Two blocks away.

548
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:28,520
She's not my wife.

549
00:40:29,621 --> 00:40:31,120
Let's go.

550
00:40:34,821 --> 00:40:36,420
This is insane.

551
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:39,220
10 minutes ago, I'm about to
enjoy a quiet little dinner...

552
00:40:39,220 --> 00:40:41,121
...and received this note.

553
00:40:44,821 --> 00:40:47,321
- He's breathing, isn't he?
- Yes.

554
00:40:47,321 --> 00:40:49,921
Is the siren entirely necessary?

555
00:41:03,521 --> 00:41:06,822
Let's just talk to someone
who can get this over with, shall we?

556
00:41:06,822 --> 00:41:08,422
Hang on.

557
00:41:09,422 --> 00:41:11,922
They need your
drivers license number.

558
00:41:26,223 --> 00:41:28,523
Oh, no,
you've got to be kidding.

559
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,223
What is... uh...

560
00:41:30,223 --> 00:41:31,923
- ...happening?
- This was what I was trying to explain to you.

561
00:41:31,923 --> 00:41:33,123
This is a... uh...

562
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,623
...a game.

563
00:41:35,623 --> 00:41:37,223
- A what?
- It's a company.

564
00:41:37,223 --> 00:41:38,724
They plan elaborate pranks.

565
00:41:38,724 --> 00:41:42,024
Things like this.
I don't really understand it myself.

566
00:41:43,124 --> 00:41:44,924
What are you talking about?
This is a...

567
00:41:45,623 --> 00:41:47,424
The lights, they went out...

568
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:49,224
...hundred people ran away.

569
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:52,124
What you mean the guy who just...

570
00:41:52,124 --> 00:41:54,324
...pissed himself
and turned blue was...

571
00:41:54,324 --> 00:41:55,925
Sorry about that.

572
00:41:57,124 --> 00:41:58,725
You should be.

573
00:42:02,825 --> 00:42:04,524
Why're they involving you?

574
00:42:05,724 --> 00:42:09,225
There's gotta be a...

575
00:42:09,225 --> 00:42:10,825
...a flashlight.

576
00:42:11,225 --> 00:42:12,826
Oh, great.

577
00:42:18,126 --> 00:42:21,026
I thought that guy was going to die
gave him a mouth to mouth.

578
00:42:21,525 --> 00:42:23,026
I'll see you around.

579
00:42:26,226 --> 00:42:28,725
- How do you know that's the way?
- I don't.

580
00:42:40,827 --> 00:42:44,526
Where did you all go
you motherfucking frat boys?

581
00:42:46,427 --> 00:42:48,127
You'd better hide.

582
00:43:08,328 --> 00:43:09,928
Lobby?

583
00:43:54,230 --> 00:43:58,931
My brother got me this
gift certificate to this company.

584
00:43:58,931 --> 00:44:01,730
Why? I got the key out of this uh...

585
00:44:01,730 --> 00:44:04,131
...out of the mouth of this... uh...

586
00:44:04,131 --> 00:44:05,830
...wooden clown.

587
00:44:06,730 --> 00:44:08,331
Never mind.

588
00:44:12,531 --> 00:44:13,932
I didn't like this.

589
00:44:23,432 --> 00:44:24,432
There's no signal.

590
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:27,932
What is the going rate
for a trapped-in-elevator-adventure?

591
00:44:30,132 --> 00:44:31,732
Well, don't even think about it.

592
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,132
- Why not?
- Read what the sign says.

593
00:44:34,132 --> 00:44:37,232
"Warning: Do not attempt to open,
if the elevator stops..."

594
00:44:37,232 --> 00:44:38,632
"...use an emergency..."

595
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:39,832
- Phone?
- Phone...

596
00:44:39,832 --> 00:44:43,133
If there was one.
We'll wait for help, so.

597
00:44:43,133 --> 00:44:44,933
Let's just wait for help.

598
00:44:55,233 --> 00:44:56,633
Okay, I'll give you a boost.

599
00:44:56,633 --> 00:44:58,533
You get up, you go first.

600
00:44:58,733 --> 00:45:01,433
This is not an attempt to be gallant,
if I don' t lift you...

601
00:45:01,433 --> 00:45:02,633
...how are you going to
get up there?

602
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:05,034
I don't know, you pull me up.

603
00:45:05,034 --> 00:45:07,034
It's easier my way,
come on, step up.

604
00:45:07,034 --> 00:45:09,434
- No.
- Oh, please.

605
00:45:09,434 --> 00:45:11,034
I'm not wearing any underwear.

606
00:45:12,534 --> 00:45:14,134
Okay, there I said it.

607
00:45:19,434 --> 00:45:21,035
Okay.

608
00:45:36,735 --> 00:45:38,735
We can use this like a ladder.

609
00:45:38,735 --> 00:45:40,735
My hero, let's go.

610
00:45:43,935 --> 00:45:45,236
I don't think so.

611
00:45:48,136 --> 00:45:49,636
Thank you.

612
00:45:57,836 --> 00:45:59,536
Damn it! My briefcase!

613
00:46:03,337 --> 00:46:04,936
I'll wait.

614
00:46:05,537 --> 00:46:07,637
Not as if anybody can open it.

615
00:46:15,837 --> 00:46:18,337
Wait a minute,
this is C. R. S.

616
00:46:18,337 --> 00:46:20,637
- What's C. R. S.?
- This is the company that I was telling you about.

617
00:46:20,637 --> 00:46:23,537
The one that gave me a
gift certificate.

618
00:46:23,537 --> 00:46:25,138
This is their building.

619
00:46:32,037 --> 00:46:35,538
We'll wait,
we'll wait for the security to come...

620
00:46:35,538 --> 00:46:37,139
...and we'll just explain.

621
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:38,838
They'll love that!

622
00:46:38,838 --> 00:46:40,538
Explain for both of us!

623
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:01,240
We don't wanna draw it,
don't draw any attentions.

624
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,739
- Just out for a stall.
- Run!

625
00:47:09,039 --> 00:47:10,740
We can't fit down there!

626
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,241
Are you trying to ditch me?

627
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:23,040
- Hey! you're a grown man, I'm not responsible for...
- I'm not the one who started running.

628
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:25,640
Well, I'm not
the one that started this...

629
00:47:43,041 --> 00:47:45,041
- Go up there!
- I'm going.

630
00:47:47,242 --> 00:47:48,841
Here.

631
00:47:49,041 --> 00:47:50,442
Climb.

632
00:47:50,542 --> 00:47:52,041
Climb.

633
00:48:01,042 --> 00:48:03,742
So where's your modesty
around the pet dogs?

634
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:17,943
Hey! Shut up!
Stupid fucking dogs!

635
00:48:21,743 --> 00:48:23,143
Let me guess!

636
00:48:23,244 --> 00:48:24,843
I go first.

637
00:48:36,044 --> 00:48:38,044
There goes a thousand dollars.

638
00:48:38,044 --> 00:48:40,344
Your shoes cost a thousand dollars?

639
00:48:40,344 --> 00:48:41,944
That one did.

640
00:48:48,044 --> 00:48:49,144
Here.

641
00:48:49,144 --> 00:48:50,645
Come on.

642
00:48:53,645 --> 00:48:54,845
It's right there.

643
00:48:54,845 --> 00:48:57,145
Meals Miles.

644
00:48:57,345 --> 00:48:58,445
What?

645
00:48:58,445 --> 00:48:59,645
It should be here.

646
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,045
Fire escape.

647
00:49:21,046 --> 00:49:23,246
Yeah, it's classic.

648
00:49:24,646 --> 00:49:26,246
Why me?

649
00:49:30,046 --> 00:49:31,647
Who are you?

650
00:49:32,747 --> 00:49:34,347
Nicholas Van Orton.

651
00:49:35,047 --> 00:49:37,246
What are you,
a czar or something?

652
00:49:38,347 --> 00:49:39,947
All right.

653
00:49:40,647 --> 00:49:42,348
I think...

654
00:49:42,348 --> 00:49:43,647
...if we...

655
00:49:43,647 --> 00:49:45,448
...drop from here...

656
00:49:45,448 --> 00:49:47,548
...the garbage will break our fall.

657
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:49,047
I think not.

658
00:49:49,047 --> 00:49:50,648
Be careful!

659
00:49:56,048 --> 00:49:58,448
What the fuck are you looking at?

660
00:49:58,448 --> 00:50:00,048
Oh...

661
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:01,648
...shit!

662
00:50:26,849 --> 00:50:28,550
Table for two please.

663
00:50:34,850 --> 00:50:36,149
Where're we going?

664
00:50:36,149 --> 00:50:37,850
That tall bright building.

665
00:50:37,850 --> 00:50:39,349
It's right near there.

666
00:50:45,150 --> 00:50:46,651
Everything okay, miss?

667
00:50:47,750 --> 00:50:49,350
Yeah.

668
00:50:49,350 --> 00:50:50,950
How are you doing?

669
00:50:51,651 --> 00:50:53,751
San Francisco's finest...

670
00:51:04,651 --> 00:51:06,751
Is there some place
I could throw this?

671
00:51:08,251 --> 00:51:10,951
There's a waste basket
beside the desk.

672
00:51:12,251 --> 00:51:13,151
Oh...

673
00:51:13,151 --> 00:51:15,952
Think I have a fresh sweat shirt
for you somewhere.

674
00:51:17,451 --> 00:51:18,952
That would be great.

675
00:51:23,252 --> 00:51:26,152
You know, you've never even
asked me my name.

676
00:51:26,152 --> 00:51:30,352
Well, uh... maitre d' said
you're name was Christine.

677
00:51:30,352 --> 00:51:31,853
All right.

678
00:51:33,152 --> 00:51:34,853
I guess I'll call you a cab.

679
00:51:39,352 --> 00:51:41,452
You got a shower in your office?

680
00:51:41,452 --> 00:51:42,653
Yeah.

681
00:51:42,653 --> 00:51:45,453
You an athlete or something?

682
00:51:45,453 --> 00:51:47,953
No, I'm an investment banker.

683
00:51:47,953 --> 00:51:52,153
I move money from
one place to another.

684
00:51:55,353 --> 00:51:57,453
Actually, would you mind
if I just...

685
00:51:57,453 --> 00:51:58,954
...quickly rinsed off?

686
00:51:59,854 --> 00:52:01,453
No.

687
00:52:02,254 --> 00:52:07,655
- Is there a towel I could use?
- Yeah, it's... uh.. it's... it's behind the door.

688
00:52:07,655 --> 00:52:10,555
- Oh, I'll just be a second.
- No problem.

689
00:52:13,154 --> 00:52:17,855
Listen, I know the owner of the city club
and I'd be happy to give him a call...

690
00:52:17,855 --> 00:52:19,155
...if you'd like.

691
00:52:19,155 --> 00:52:22,155
Don't, it was a shitty job anyway.
I overreacted.

692
00:52:23,155 --> 00:52:26,155
I, uh...

693
00:52:26,155 --> 00:52:28,355
I have a confession to make.

694
00:52:29,656 --> 00:52:33,756
Someone gave me 400 bucks to
spill drinks on you as a...

695
00:52:33,756 --> 00:52:34,756
...practical joke.

696
00:52:34,756 --> 00:52:36,156
Really?

697
00:52:36,156 --> 00:52:37,156
And what did they say?

698
00:52:37,156 --> 00:52:39,156
Well, they said 300, I said 4...

699
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:40,555
...they said the guy in
the gray flannel suit...

700
00:52:40,555 --> 00:52:43,156
...I think I said the...

701
00:52:43,156 --> 00:52:45,557
...attractive guy in
the gray flannel suit?

702
00:53:10,658 --> 00:53:12,257
<i>Mr. Van Orton?</i>

703
00:53:22,658 --> 00:53:25,158
<i>- Hello?
- Mr. Van Orton, it's Maria.</i>

704
00:53:25,158 --> 00:53:27,158
<i>- I thought I should call.
- What time is it?</i>

705
00:53:27,558 --> 00:53:29,058
<i>It's 11 o'clock.</i>

706
00:53:29,158 --> 00:53:32,158
<i>I took the liberty of rescheduling
your meeting with Alison and...</i>

707
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:35,158
No, no, no,
I'll be in there in an hour.

708
00:53:35,158 --> 00:53:39,259
Can you, I left my briefcase
at 1019 Montgomery Street...

709
00:53:39,259 --> 00:53:41,558
Could you check with
the Losts and Founds please?

710
00:53:41,558 --> 00:53:44,159
<i>- Anson Baers in town at the Ritz Carlton.
- Really?</i>

711
00:53:44,159 --> 00:53:46,959
<i>- He's requesting dinner tonight.
- Well, we'll see about that.</i>

712
00:53:46,959 --> 00:53:49,159
<i>And the Hotel Niko called to say...</i>

713
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:52,159
<i>...they have your
American Express card at the front desk.</i>

714
00:53:52,159 --> 00:53:53,660
<i>You left it there last night?</i>

715
00:53:55,159 --> 00:53:57,559
<i>- Should I send someone?
- No, just give me the number.</i>

716
00:53:57,559 --> 00:54:00,459
<i>- 555-1111.
- Call you back.</i>

717
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:06,160
<i>Good morning! Hotel Niko.</i>

718
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:09,660
Yes, this is Nicholas Van Orton.
I'm told you have my American Express card.

719
00:54:09,660 --> 00:54:11,560
<i>Yes, Mr. Van Orton,
everything's in order...</i>

720
00:54:11,560 --> 00:54:14,160
<i>...the concierge has arranged for the wine
and flowers in the room.</i>

721
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:15,061
Has he?

722
00:54:15,061 --> 00:54:17,360
<i>And a young woman phoned
to say that she's on route...</i>

723
00:54:17,360 --> 00:54:19,261
<i>...but running a little late.</i>

724
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,660
Did the young woman
leave her name?

725
00:54:23,261 --> 00:54:25,061
<i>I'm sure I don't know.</i>

726
00:54:25,061 --> 00:54:26,261
Of course you don't.

727
00:54:26,261 --> 00:54:27,762
Thank you.

728
00:54:38,361 --> 00:54:39,661
Sorry, my fault.

729
00:54:47,162 --> 00:54:48,862
Ah, Mr. Van Orton.

730
00:54:48,862 --> 00:54:50,462
Welcome back.

731
00:54:50,462 --> 00:54:51,963
Here we go.

732
00:54:53,863 --> 00:54:55,362
Have we met?

733
00:54:56,462 --> 00:54:57,963
I believe so.

734
00:55:01,562 --> 00:55:03,163
If you'll just sign here...

735
00:55:03,163 --> 00:55:04,662
...on the signature card.

736
00:55:12,063 --> 00:55:13,663
Thank you.

737
00:55:18,164 --> 00:55:19,763
My key?

738
00:55:22,064 --> 00:55:23,864
Don't I get a key?

739
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:27,264
Didn't I give you one last night?

740
00:55:27,264 --> 00:55:28,764
No, I don't think so.

741
00:55:32,564 --> 00:55:34,364
Cute, that's very cute.

742
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:36,764
This way, sir.

743
00:55:37,165 --> 00:55:38,764
Have a nice day.

744
00:57:20,569 --> 00:57:22,170
<i>House keeping.</i>

745
00:57:29,270 --> 00:57:31,870
Could you come back a little later?

746
00:57:57,172 --> 00:57:58,571
Ah...

747
00:57:58,571 --> 00:58:00,072
Shit!

748
00:59:47,377 --> 00:59:48,976
Where the fuck is he?

749
00:59:50,076 --> 00:59:51,877
Why are you following me?

750
00:59:51,877 --> 00:59:53,377
What are you talking about?

751
00:59:53,377 --> 00:59:55,477
I'm not following you.
I'm just driving it.

752
00:59:55,477 --> 00:59:56,777
Hey...

753
00:59:56,777 --> 01:00:00,278
- ...whatever I'm doing is none of your business.
- Is Anson Baer the game?

754
01:00:00,278 --> 01:00:01,577
Is that what this is all about?

755
01:00:01,577 --> 01:00:04,278
Yo, buddy, back off,
just back off, huh?

756
01:00:04,378 --> 01:00:05,678
What?

757
01:00:05,678 --> 01:00:08,878
Oh, that's cute,
that's really cute.

758
01:00:08,878 --> 01:00:11,678
I suppose the game uses
real bullets, huh?

759
01:00:16,378 --> 01:00:19,179
All right,
I'm a private investigator.

760
01:00:19,179 --> 01:00:20,379
Somebody hired me
to keep tabs on you.

761
01:00:20,379 --> 01:00:21,379
Who?

762
01:00:21,379 --> 01:00:23,579
Who hired you?

763
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:35,679
<i>- Mr. Van Orton...
- Maria, get hold of Sutherland.</i>

764
01:00:35,679 --> 01:00:37,179
Have him meet me at
the Ritz Carlton.

765
01:00:37,179 --> 01:00:38,679
I'm on my way.

766
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:52,480
- What's happening?
- Follow me, Sam.

767
01:01:00,180 --> 01:01:01,880
Ah, Nicholas!

768
01:01:01,880 --> 01:01:03,381
It's unexpected.

769
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,080
Have you really believed...

770
01:01:10,080 --> 01:01:13,180
...that just because
you publish children's books...

771
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:15,181
...people's gonna care about
my reputation?

772
01:01:15,181 --> 01:01:16,781
You could have pictures of me...

773
01:01:16,781 --> 01:01:19,881
...wearing nipple rings
butt fucking captain kangaroo...

774
01:01:19,881 --> 01:01:22,181
...the only thing they care about
is the stock!

775
01:01:22,181 --> 01:01:24,682
And whether that stock is up or down...

776
01:01:24,682 --> 01:01:25,781
- Daddy?
- It's all right, it's all right.

777
01:01:25,781 --> 01:01:30,982
And the fact that you bring Conrad
into this juvenile game...

778
01:01:30,982 --> 01:01:32,582
...is unconscionable.

779
01:01:33,882 --> 01:01:36,382
- Are you finished?
- No! I'm not finished!

780
01:01:37,283 --> 01:01:39,582
I'd like you to meet
my attorney, Samuel Sutherland.

781
01:01:39,582 --> 01:01:42,182
I think the two of you
have got something to talk about.

782
01:01:42,182 --> 01:01:44,483
Oh, we've met this morning.

783
01:01:44,483 --> 01:01:47,483
I signed the determination contract
for Baer/Grant.

784
01:01:47,483 --> 01:01:50,282
I accepted your settlement, Nicholas.

785
01:01:51,182 --> 01:01:52,282
You were right.

786
01:01:52,282 --> 01:01:55,183
I'm going sailing,
you know, sailing.

787
01:01:56,483 --> 01:01:59,483
You're welcome to join our lunch
maybe...

788
01:01:59,483 --> 01:02:00,983
...we can straighten this out.

789
01:02:01,683 --> 01:02:05,584
You remember my wife Mary Carol
and my daughter-in-law Kaliegh.

790
01:02:13,084 --> 01:02:15,684
Please, uh...

791
01:02:15,684 --> 01:02:18,884
...accept my...

792
01:02:18,884 --> 01:02:20,184
...misguided, uh...

793
01:02:32,985 --> 01:02:34,885
How concerned should I be?

794
01:02:34,885 --> 01:02:36,685
It was a misunderstanding.

795
01:02:38,385 --> 01:02:40,185
It looks a lot like you.

796
01:02:41,285 --> 01:02:44,185
Well, you should see
what they do with the nightly news.

797
01:02:44,486 --> 01:02:45,586
What?

798
01:02:45,586 --> 01:02:47,486
Can I ask you to do me a favor?

799
01:02:47,486 --> 01:02:48,985
You know you can

800
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:53,385
Find out about a company called
Consumer Recreation Services.

801
01:02:54,385 --> 01:02:56,686
Sounds like they make
tennis rackets.

802
01:02:56,686 --> 01:02:58,186
What do you know?

803
01:02:59,786 --> 01:03:01,686
Well, they gave me a waiver...

804
01:03:17,087 --> 01:03:19,787
- What is this?
- It's a...

805
01:03:23,987 --> 01:03:27,387
I don't believe it,
it's invisible ink.

806
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:30,187
- Your joking.
- This is what I'm dealing with. I'm being toyed with by...

807
01:03:30,187 --> 01:03:33,387
...by a bunch of depraved
children, this...

808
01:03:35,287 --> 01:03:36,788
Are you ok?

809
01:03:37,888 --> 01:03:39,588
Tell me not to worry.

810
01:03:41,688 --> 01:03:43,188
You don't have to worry.

811
01:03:44,188 --> 01:03:45,988
I promise.

812
01:03:48,988 --> 01:03:50,388
I'll call you later.

813
01:03:51,789 --> 01:03:53,288
Right.

814
01:03:56,789 --> 01:03:58,489
Maria, the other night...

815
01:03:58,489 --> 01:03:59,989
...last night...

816
01:03:59,989 --> 01:04:02,089
...got a taxi for
a young woman named Christine...

817
01:04:02,089 --> 01:04:03,789
What's the company that we use?

818
01:04:03,789 --> 01:04:04,690
United?

819
01:04:04,690 --> 01:04:06,490
- What?
- United Taxi Company.

820
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,389
United Taxi...

821
01:04:07,389 --> 01:04:09,590
...then you call United,
find out who the driver was and...

822
01:04:11,089 --> 01:04:13,090
...where they took her.

823
01:04:41,291 --> 01:04:42,691
Ilsa!

824
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:18,593
I have a gun!

825
01:05:51,594 --> 01:05:58,594
<i>#...and you just had some kind of mushroom
and your mind is moving slow...</i>

826
01:06:00,594 --> 01:06:04,696
<i>#...go ask Alice...</i>

827
01:06:04,696 --> 01:06:09,896
<i>#...I think she'll know...</i>

828
01:06:09,896 --> 01:06:16,896
<i>#...when logic and proportion
have fallen sloppy dead...</i>

829
01:06:18,696 --> 01:06:25,697
<i>#...and the white knight is talking backwards
and the red queen's off...</i>

830
01:06:30,396 --> 01:06:36,697
<i># Remember what the doormouse said:..</i>

831
01:06:39,397 --> 01:06:42,297
Ilsa? Ilsa... Ilsa...

832
01:06:42,297 --> 01:06:43,797
- Mr. Van Orton!
- Are you all right?

833
01:06:43,897 --> 01:06:45,197
What do you mean?
What's happened?

834
01:06:45,197 --> 01:06:46,497
The house,
you haven't seen the house?

835
01:06:46,497 --> 01:06:47,597
What's wrong?

836
01:06:47,597 --> 01:06:49,197
There's been a break in,
now lock your door...

837
01:06:49,197 --> 01:06:51,698
- Stay inside, just lock your door.
- Oh, be careful.

838
01:06:58,198 --> 01:07:00,498
<i>- 911, emergency?
- Yes, I need the police.</i>

839
01:07:00,498 --> 01:07:04,298
<i>- There's been a break in to my house.
- Stay on the line and give me your address.</i>

840
01:07:04,298 --> 01:07:07,098
My address is 2210, Broadway.

841
01:07:07,098 --> 01:07:08,698
It's the biggest house on the street.

842
01:07:08,698 --> 01:07:12,198
<i>- Now, sir, you said it was a break in?
- Yes, yes, there's been a break in.</i>

843
01:07:12,198 --> 01:07:13,799
<i>Are you sure they're gone?</i>

844
01:07:14,598 --> 01:07:16,099
What?

845
01:07:16,099 --> 01:07:18,799
<i>Are you sure there's not still
someone somewhere in the house?</i>

846
01:07:20,899 --> 01:07:22,499
<i>- Nickie!
- Sir?</i>

847
01:07:22,499 --> 01:07:23,599
<i>Are you still there?</i>

848
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:24,899
<i>- Meet me in your car.
- Hello?</i>

849
01:07:24,899 --> 01:07:26,800
<i>Hello?</i>

850
01:07:26,800 --> 01:07:28,399
<i>Sir?</i>

851
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,599
- All right. What happened?
- Sssh.

852
01:07:39,800 --> 01:07:41,100
Conrad, where're we going?

853
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,699
Just wait!

854
01:07:47,100 --> 01:07:48,600
What are you doing?

855
01:07:48,600 --> 01:07:50,100
With the facts...

856
01:07:50,200 --> 01:07:51,901
...I can't trust
a room service in the hotel...

857
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,500
...I sure as hell can't
trust the fucking car.

858
01:07:53,500 --> 01:07:56,301
- Who?
- C. R. S.! who do you think?

859
01:07:56,301 --> 01:07:58,201
Jesus! To think what
I almost got you into.

860
01:07:58,201 --> 01:07:59,500
What are you saying?

861
01:07:59,500 --> 01:08:01,201
Oh, I'm so fucked.

862
01:08:01,201 --> 01:08:04,501
They just fuck you! And they fuck you!
And they fuck you!

863
01:08:04,501 --> 01:08:07,301
And just when you think it's all over,
that's when the real fucking starts!

864
01:08:07,301 --> 01:08:09,601
All right, calm down,
just take a breath.

865
01:08:13,102 --> 01:08:14,601
They won't stop, Nick.

866
01:08:15,102 --> 01:08:18,202
I paid the bill.
I gave them their fucking money.

867
01:08:18,402 --> 01:08:19,801
They won't leave me alone!

868
01:08:19,801 --> 01:08:20,801
What're they doing to you?

869
01:08:20,801 --> 01:08:23,102
Everything!
I'm a goddamned human pinata.

870
01:08:23,102 --> 01:08:24,602
Calm down!

871
01:08:24,602 --> 01:08:27,402
- And why're they keep playing, if you've already paid?
- I don't know.

872
01:08:27,402 --> 01:08:30,202
I don' t know.
I paid them more to make it stop!

873
01:08:42,503 --> 01:08:43,703
They did this.

874
01:08:43,703 --> 01:08:45,103
It's a flat tire.

875
01:08:45,103 --> 01:08:46,103
How do you know?!

876
01:08:46,103 --> 01:08:48,303
Get a grip on yourself, will you?
We'll figure it out!

877
01:08:48,303 --> 01:08:49,904
Okay, okay.

878
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,504
The phone doesn't work.
I can't get a signal.

879
01:09:02,504 --> 01:09:04,004
Really?

880
01:09:04,204 --> 01:09:06,804
- You know how to change a tire?
- No, don't you?

881
01:09:07,204 --> 01:09:08,404
It can't be that hard.

882
01:09:08,404 --> 01:09:10,204
I don't think we should be out
in the open like this.

883
01:09:10,204 --> 01:09:12,704
Hit the teletrack
it's lift-left compartment.

884
01:09:32,906 --> 01:09:34,605
You're with them.

885
01:09:35,505 --> 01:09:36,905
What?

886
01:09:36,905 --> 01:09:38,905
You're doing this,
you're part of it.

887
01:09:42,306 --> 01:09:43,905
Whose are these?

888
01:09:45,106 --> 01:09:47,406
I don't know about those.
Somebody put them in the car.

889
01:09:47,406 --> 01:09:49,506
You're behind the whole thing,
aren't you?

890
01:09:49,506 --> 01:09:51,806
What are you talking about?
You brought them to me.

891
01:09:51,806 --> 01:09:53,406
These were in your car!

892
01:09:53,406 --> 01:09:56,307
Now right there in your fucking car!

893
01:09:56,307 --> 01:09:57,906
Conrad!

894
01:10:03,107 --> 01:10:04,607
Listen to what you're saying.

895
01:10:04,607 --> 01:10:06,906
No! You're not gonna
control this conversation!

896
01:10:06,906 --> 01:10:09,007
Why would I ever do
what you're describing?

897
01:10:09,007 --> 01:10:10,307
Because you resent me.

898
01:10:10,307 --> 01:10:11,707
Stop being emotional.

899
01:10:11,707 --> 01:10:14,907
- It kills you that I'm living my life.
- Lower your voice, Conrad!

900
01:10:14,907 --> 01:10:17,607
What? You're afraid
somebody's gonna witness the scene?

901
01:10:17,607 --> 01:10:19,008
Get back in there!
Get back to your fucking house!

902
01:10:19,008 --> 01:10:20,907
- Will you stop it?
- I'm calling the cops.

903
01:10:20,907 --> 01:10:22,608
You're just so afraid
that somebody's gonna see...

904
01:10:22,608 --> 01:10:24,508
...what a manipulated
fucking control freak you are!

905
01:10:24,508 --> 01:10:26,508
What is wrong with you?
What are you on?

906
01:10:26,508 --> 01:10:28,308
Oh, I'm sorry, Nick...

907
01:10:28,308 --> 01:10:30,708
I'm sorry I didn't
live up to your expectations.

908
01:10:30,708 --> 01:10:31,808
Ah, bullshit!

909
01:10:31,808 --> 01:10:34,209
I'm not you, I'll never be you,
I don't wanna be you.

910
01:10:34,209 --> 01:10:35,309
There you go again!

911
01:10:35,309 --> 01:10:36,309
I'm your brother!

912
01:10:36,309 --> 01:10:39,908
- Always push the responsibility out on me
- For Christ's sakes! I'm your brother!

913
01:10:39,908 --> 01:10:43,209
- All I ever tried to do is help you.
- I don't want your help!

914
01:10:43,209 --> 01:10:46,709
- Nobody asked you to play Dad!
- No! You don't say that.

915
01:10:46,709 --> 01:10:48,409
Did I have a choice?

916
01:10:48,409 --> 01:10:50,010
Did I have a choice?

917
01:11:09,710 --> 01:11:11,310
Conrad!

918
01:11:44,512 --> 01:11:45,812
What?

919
01:11:45,812 --> 01:11:47,212
<i>I don't want your help!</i>

920
01:11:47,212 --> 01:11:49,312
<i>- Nobody asked you to play Dad!
- Did I have a choice?</i>

921
01:11:49,312 --> 01:11:51,113
<i>Did I have a choice?</i>

922
01:12:10,913 --> 01:12:12,513
Taxi!

923
01:12:18,214 --> 01:12:20,013
2210, Broadway.

924
01:12:46,415 --> 01:12:48,215
Hey, buddy, you missed a turn.

925
01:12:50,215 --> 01:12:51,315
Hey!

926
01:12:51,315 --> 01:12:53,015
Do you hear me?

927
01:12:53,015 --> 01:12:54,615
You missed a turn back...

928
01:12:56,715 --> 01:12:59,416
No, no, no!
Stop the car!

929
01:12:59,416 --> 01:13:00,915
Stop the car!

930
01:13:05,316 --> 01:13:07,115
Thank you.

931
01:13:07,115 --> 01:13:08,516
Open the door.

932
01:13:08,516 --> 01:13:09,916
Unlock the door.

933
01:13:09,916 --> 01:13:11,916
Open the goddamn door!

934
01:13:20,317 --> 01:13:21,417
Listen.

935
01:13:21,417 --> 01:13:24,916
I... am a very wealthy man.

936
01:13:25,617 --> 01:13:28,517
And whatever they're paying you...

937
01:13:28,517 --> 01:13:30,017
...I'll double it.

938
01:13:58,218 --> 01:13:59,718
No!

939
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:22,620
What are you, out of
your fucking mind?

940
01:14:39,220 --> 01:14:41,220
It's a game.

941
01:14:41,220 --> 01:14:42,721
It's game.

942
01:15:25,122 --> 01:15:26,723
Here we are!

943
01:15:30,723 --> 01:15:33,223
- Detective, I'm Sam Sutherland.
- Tim Folly.

944
01:15:35,123 --> 01:15:36,623
You know where we're going?

945
01:15:36,623 --> 01:15:37,823
It's this way.

946
01:15:37,923 --> 01:15:39,223
14th floor.

947
01:15:58,624 --> 01:15:59,724
Okay...

948
01:15:59,724 --> 01:16:03,425
Management for the building says the space
hasn' t been officially rented yet

949
01:16:03,425 --> 01:16:06,925
The county recorder has
no listing for a Consumer...

950
01:16:06,925 --> 01:16:10,324
...Recreation Service
or any derivation thereof.

951
01:16:10,324 --> 01:16:12,224
Divers, they're still
looking for the cab...

952
01:16:12,224 --> 01:16:14,925
...as soon as they find it,
they'll pull the plates in the V. I. N.

953
01:16:14,925 --> 01:16:16,525
Have you spoken to your brother?

954
01:16:16,525 --> 01:16:18,625
He hasn't called me back yet.
No.

955
01:16:19,425 --> 01:16:20,425
What about the house?

956
01:16:20,425 --> 01:16:23,925
The graffiti was an oil-based
marine marking solution...

957
01:16:23,925 --> 01:16:25,125
...illegal in the states.

958
01:16:25,125 --> 01:16:27,826
It's not impossible to trace,
but it'll take time.

959
01:16:27,826 --> 01:16:29,125
The photo...

960
01:16:29,125 --> 01:16:30,125
...the gun...

961
01:16:30,125 --> 01:16:31,225
...the clown...

962
01:16:31,225 --> 01:16:32,726
...the ambulance...

963
01:16:33,425 --> 01:16:34,926
...it's all pending.

964
01:16:35,226 --> 01:16:37,126
Breaking and entering
we've got solid.

965
01:16:37,426 --> 01:16:40,527
Malicious mischief, vandalism,
harassment...

966
01:16:40,527 --> 01:16:42,426
- ...but that's all.
- Illegal surveillance...

967
01:16:42,426 --> 01:16:43,627
...reckless endangerment...

968
01:16:43,727 --> 01:16:45,226
Attempted murder.

969
01:16:46,527 --> 01:16:49,226
Except, you said you
hired these guys.

970
01:16:49,226 --> 01:16:50,226
That's irrelevant.

971
01:16:50,226 --> 01:16:51,927
Now, look.

972
01:16:51,927 --> 01:16:53,827
It's our job to tell you
what we've got...

973
01:16:53,827 --> 01:16:56,327
...so far, we don't have motive.

974
01:17:05,828 --> 01:17:07,728
What was my father like, Ilsa?

975
01:17:08,427 --> 01:17:09,928
Why do you ask?

976
01:17:10,327 --> 01:17:11,928
I don't know.

977
01:17:12,928 --> 01:17:16,228
All the time I've known you,
you've never once asked about him.

978
01:17:18,928 --> 01:17:21,328
I guess he was just on my mind.

979
01:17:21,328 --> 01:17:24,528
Your mother loved
your father very much.

980
01:17:24,528 --> 01:17:27,128
I think he's just worked too hard.

981
01:17:27,128 --> 01:17:29,729
Was he...

982
01:17:29,729 --> 01:17:30,929
...morose?

983
01:17:30,929 --> 01:17:32,228
I mean...

984
01:17:32,228 --> 01:17:34,129
What I remember most...

985
01:17:34,129 --> 01:17:36,528
...was that his manner was so...

986
01:17:36,528 --> 01:17:37,929
...slight.

987
01:17:38,729 --> 01:17:40,329
You could spend time in a room...

988
01:17:40,329 --> 01:17:43,329
...and not even know that he'd
been there the whole time...

989
01:17:43,329 --> 01:17:45,429
No, what I mean is...

990
01:17:46,429 --> 01:17:47,930
Before he...

991
01:17:47,930 --> 01:17:49,529
What happened, no?

992
01:17:49,529 --> 01:17:51,429
Nobody expected it.

993
01:17:52,329 --> 01:17:54,930
I wonder how much of him there
is in me?

994
01:17:56,330 --> 01:17:58,030
Not much, I think.

995
01:18:01,230 --> 01:18:03,130
Was mother worried about him?

996
01:18:03,930 --> 01:18:06,330
Nobody ever worried
about your father.

997
01:18:11,131 --> 01:18:12,430
<i>- Yes.
- It's Maria.</i>

998
01:18:12,430 --> 01:18:15,731
<i>- I found the address you wanted from United Taxi.
- Yeah, give it to me.</i>

999
01:18:15,731 --> 01:18:17,431
<i>It's on the Patraro Hill...</i>

1000
01:19:18,434 --> 01:19:20,034
Who are you?

1001
01:19:21,834 --> 01:19:23,634
Christine, is she here?

1002
01:19:24,134 --> 01:19:25,534
She's sleeping.

1003
01:19:25,534 --> 01:19:27,134
<i>Amian, who is it?</i>

1004
01:19:29,735 --> 01:19:31,534
Hey!
What're you doing here?

1005
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:33,135
Can we talk?

1006
01:19:33,735 --> 01:19:35,335
Sure.

1007
01:19:39,335 --> 01:19:40,935
- Hi.
- Hi.

1008
01:19:44,535 --> 01:19:46,535
Didn't think I'd ever
see you again.

1009
01:19:46,535 --> 01:19:48,435
What can you tell me
about these?

1010
01:19:49,736 --> 01:19:51,335
Is this you?

1011
01:19:52,635 --> 01:19:54,136
Where did you get them?

1012
01:19:54,136 --> 01:19:55,635
My hotel room.

1013
01:19:56,336 --> 01:19:59,635
Was in my hotel...
Are you telling me that this is not you?

1014
01:20:00,836 --> 01:20:03,136
What makes you... um...

1015
01:20:04,536 --> 01:20:05,937
...think this is me?

1016
01:20:05,937 --> 01:20:07,336
Well... um...

1017
01:20:07,336 --> 01:20:08,937
...the bra, the red bra.

1018
01:20:09,536 --> 01:20:11,037
Okay.

1019
01:20:11,536 --> 01:20:13,037
What I thought that...

1020
01:20:18,237 --> 01:20:20,237
Can I sit down for a..?

1021
01:20:20,237 --> 01:20:21,736
Sure.

1022
01:20:22,537 --> 01:20:24,037
Are you all right?

1023
01:20:26,337 --> 01:20:27,737
You're not all right, are you?

1024
01:20:28,337 --> 01:20:32,038
Is it this contest thing
that you're in still or..?

1025
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:35,938
I'm sorry, I am being a nuisance.
I should go.

1026
01:20:35,938 --> 01:20:36,938
No, it's ok, we can talk.

1027
01:20:36,938 --> 01:20:38,737
I'll put some clothes on me,
I'll be right back.

1028
01:20:45,939 --> 01:20:47,538
Do you have an aspirin?

1029
01:22:38,743 --> 01:22:40,843
Can I get you something
to drink with this?

1030
01:22:40,843 --> 01:22:42,344
Is this you?

1031
01:22:43,244 --> 01:22:45,744
Oh, yeah.
That's a first communion.

1032
01:22:47,244 --> 01:22:48,644
Show it to me.

1033
01:22:49,344 --> 01:22:53,045
- What's wrong?
- Take the picture out of the frame...

1034
01:22:53,045 --> 01:22:54,544
...and show it to me.

1035
01:22:54,944 --> 01:22:56,445
All right.

1036
01:22:58,644 --> 01:23:00,345
They're watching.

1037
01:23:00,345 --> 01:23:01,345
What?

1038
01:23:01,345 --> 01:23:02,345
Not here.

1039
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:04,445
They can see here.

1040
01:23:05,645 --> 01:23:07,245
Smoke detector.

1041
01:23:11,545 --> 01:23:13,945
What do you say, we... uh...

1042
01:23:13,945 --> 01:23:16,146
Let's go for a drive or something
we could...

1043
01:23:16,146 --> 01:23:22,146
- No, no, I am tired of this! I am goddamn tired of this!
- We'll go for a drink, there's a...

1044
01:23:22,146 --> 01:23:23,546
Who do you people think you are?

1045
01:23:23,546 --> 01:23:26,846
Who do you think you are?
Come on, out of there!

1046
01:23:26,846 --> 01:23:28,446
- Nicholas, please!
- Let's go, right now!

1047
01:23:28,446 --> 01:23:30,846
Come on,
just come on out of there right now!

1048
01:23:38,946 --> 01:23:40,447
Now you've done it.

1049
01:23:59,248 --> 01:24:00,947
So what are they going to do?

1050
01:24:00,947 --> 01:24:02,648
Get away from the window.

1051
01:24:42,650 --> 01:24:43,750
What is this?

1052
01:24:43,750 --> 01:24:45,650
Wake up, it's a fucking con.

1053
01:25:26,952 --> 01:25:28,852
Get in, get in!

1054
01:25:50,753 --> 01:25:51,953
You all right?

1055
01:25:51,953 --> 01:25:53,453
Hold on!

1056
01:26:15,355 --> 01:26:17,255
- Get out of the car.
- I could've handed you to them.

1057
01:26:17,255 --> 01:26:20,054
- And they find me now they...
- Get out of the goddamn car!

1058
01:26:20,355 --> 01:26:21,455
You don't have a choice!

1059
01:26:21,455 --> 01:26:23,954
No one else's gonna tell you
what's going on!

1060
01:26:39,955 --> 01:26:42,656
You wanna know,
'cause if I'm gone you never will.

1061
01:26:56,357 --> 01:26:59,256
I can't believe they didn't take the time
to get the fucking house right.

1062
01:26:59,856 --> 01:27:02,457
- Who are they?
- I don't know. Nobody does. I'm an employee.

1063
01:27:02,457 --> 01:27:03,457
Then what good are you?

1064
01:27:03,457 --> 01:27:04,757
I know things like who
you can trust and...

1065
01:27:04,757 --> 01:27:06,757
- ...that your brother was in it from beginning.
- That's a lie!

1066
01:27:06,757 --> 01:27:08,457
Yeah? I was your waitress
on your birthday.

1067
01:27:08,457 --> 01:27:09,957
Connie told me about C. R. S. that day.

1068
01:27:09,957 --> 01:27:11,457
Ever seen me in there before?

1069
01:27:12,957 --> 01:27:14,457
Sorry...

1070
01:27:14,457 --> 01:27:17,957
I mean it wasn't his fault,
I guess he thought it was his only way up.

1071
01:27:17,957 --> 01:27:19,358
They fleeced him real good.

1072
01:27:19,358 --> 01:27:21,358
But how? How did they get to him?

1073
01:27:21,358 --> 01:27:22,858
Same thing to him they did to you.

1074
01:27:22,858 --> 01:27:24,558
What are you talking about?

1075
01:27:24,558 --> 01:27:26,057
They checked your accounts.

1076
01:27:27,458 --> 01:27:28,358
That night in your office...

1077
01:27:28,358 --> 01:27:29,658
...I got the number to your private line...

1078
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:33,158
...and modem that gave C.R.S.
remote access to your computer.

1079
01:27:33,158 --> 01:27:34,858
You gave him everything else.

1080
01:27:35,359 --> 01:27:36,258
What?

1081
01:27:36,258 --> 01:27:38,559
You took their tests, handwriting,
voice samples, psychyinfos...

1082
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:40,759
They used it all to
figure out your passwords.

1083
01:27:42,358 --> 01:27:44,358
And Feingold the...

1084
01:27:44,358 --> 01:27:45,258
...the guy who signed you up...

1085
01:27:45,258 --> 01:27:47,759
...he did 5 years for hacking City Bank.

1086
01:27:48,559 --> 01:27:49,859
They only had to keep
you distracted...

1087
01:27:49,859 --> 01:27:51,459
...while they broke into your
financial network...

1088
01:27:51,559 --> 01:27:53,259
...transferred your holdings
into dummy accounts.

1089
01:27:53,259 --> 01:27:54,759
Overseas operator please

1090
01:27:56,259 --> 01:27:57,859
Why else would they be
willing to shoot at us?

1091
01:27:57,859 --> 01:28:00,359
Alamine Bank, Zurich, Switzerland.

1092
01:28:01,259 --> 01:28:03,359
Beause they're finished with you.

1093
01:28:05,159 --> 01:28:07,660
Live, dead, the same.

1094
01:28:07,660 --> 01:28:09,660
Long as you disappear.

1095
01:28:15,160 --> 01:28:22,160
Yes, blue-two-backslash 9690,
D as in David.

1096
01:28:23,861 --> 01:28:25,260
That's right.

1097
01:28:25,260 --> 01:28:26,661
The balance?

1098
01:28:30,961 --> 01:28:32,561
That's impossible.

1099
01:28:32,561 --> 01:28:34,361
They already got it, Nicholas.

1100
01:28:35,462 --> 01:28:37,061
They got everything.

1101
01:28:43,562 --> 01:28:46,662
<i>You've reached the Sutherlands.
Please leave a message.</i>

1102
01:28:46,662 --> 01:28:50,662
As you get this message, Sam,
I have checked them all, I don't know how...

1103
01:28:50,662 --> 01:28:54,262
...but they have drained
my accounts.

1104
01:28:54,262 --> 01:28:55,262
They're trying to kill me.

1105
01:28:55,262 --> 01:28:59,062
Now you call the cops.
I got one of them right here.

1106
01:28:59,062 --> 01:29:01,262
We'll make her to testify.

1107
01:29:01,262 --> 01:29:03,262
I know how this sounds...

1108
01:29:03,262 --> 01:29:04,763
...but you call me...

1109
01:29:04,763 --> 01:29:06,763
...on my cellular...

1110
01:29:06,763 --> 01:29:08,663
And you be careful.

1111
01:29:09,262 --> 01:29:10,963
Yeah.

1112
01:29:10,963 --> 01:29:14,163
Cut your card in half, so...

1113
01:29:14,163 --> 01:29:15,763
...my treat.

1114
01:29:54,365 --> 01:29:56,265
You take two sugars, right?

1115
01:29:57,665 --> 01:29:59,265
Never mind.

1116
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:09,766
- My name's not Christine, it's, I mean, it's not my real name.
- Who fucking cares?

1117
01:30:11,066 --> 01:30:13,966
It is just money,
you should be glad you're alive.

1118
01:30:14,966 --> 01:30:17,166
I'd rather not talk
about it right now.

1119
01:30:18,966 --> 01:30:21,966
- All I mean is someone like you...
- How many times have you done this?

1120
01:30:21,966 --> 01:30:23,266
- I'm curious.
- What?

1121
01:30:23,266 --> 01:30:24,466
These scams.

1122
01:30:24,466 --> 01:30:25,867
Con games, how many?

1123
01:30:27,266 --> 01:30:28,166
Lots.

1124
01:30:28,166 --> 01:30:31,067
Well, whatever nickle dime bullshit
you pulled in the past...

1125
01:30:31,067 --> 01:30:33,867
...this is more than just me.

1126
01:30:33,867 --> 01:30:35,767
This is pension plans...

1127
01:30:35,767 --> 01:30:37,567
...payrolls...

1128
01:30:37,567 --> 01:30:39,867
...this is 600 million dollars.

1129
01:30:53,268 --> 01:30:54,268
Yes.

1130
01:30:54,268 --> 01:30:55,268
<i>Nick, it's Sam.</i>

1131
01:30:55,268 --> 01:30:56,768
<i>I got your message.</i>

1132
01:30:56,768 --> 01:30:58,868
<i>I was disturbed to say the least.</i>

1133
01:30:58,868 --> 01:30:59,768
So what are we gonna do?

1134
01:30:59,768 --> 01:31:02,168
<i>I've been on the phone
for an hour already.</i>

1135
01:31:02,168 --> 01:31:05,568
<i>Nicholas, your funds are intact.</i>

1136
01:31:05,568 --> 01:31:07,368
<i>Nothing's been touched.</i>

1137
01:31:07,368 --> 01:31:10,568
- What are you talking about? I checked on it myself.
- Who is it?

1138
01:31:10,568 --> 01:31:14,069
<i>- I made the calls.
- Nothing's changed.</i>

1139
01:31:14,069 --> 01:31:17,269
<i>I'm telling you
not one cent is unaccounted for.</i>

1140
01:31:17,269 --> 01:31:18,369
Who is it?

1141
01:31:18,369 --> 01:31:22,069
My attorney says that
nothing is missing.

1142
01:31:22,069 --> 01:31:22,969
He's in on it.

1143
01:31:22,969 --> 01:31:25,770
<i>I don't know what the hell is happening,
but stay where you are.</i>

1144
01:31:25,770 --> 01:31:28,269
<i>- Until I get there.
- Sutherlands in on it</i>

1145
01:31:28,269 --> 01:31:30,070
<i>Nicholas, I have another call.</i>

1146
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:32,170
<i>Give me your precise location.</i>

1147
01:31:32,970 --> 01:31:34,470
<i>Nicholas?</i>

1148
01:31:38,370 --> 01:31:40,070
Got to get out of here.

1149
01:31:46,570 --> 01:31:48,470
How did they get to him?

1150
01:31:49,270 --> 01:31:50,871
Why did...

1151
01:31:53,271 --> 01:31:55,271
I wouldn't worry about it.

1152
01:32:00,772 --> 01:32:03,271
What do you mean?

1153
01:32:03,271 --> 01:32:04,972
It's out of your hands.

1154
01:32:27,973 --> 01:32:30,073
Cellurar calls can be intercepted.

1155
01:32:32,373 --> 01:32:34,273
Those calls you made...
to B of A...

1156
01:32:34,273 --> 01:32:36,973
...France, B of A, Switzerland.

1157
01:32:36,973 --> 01:32:38,273
You were talking to us.

1158
01:32:39,073 --> 01:32:40,273
You were talking to us

1159
01:32:40,273 --> 01:32:41,373
Filled in the blanks.

1160
01:32:41,373 --> 01:32:44,673
Access codes, passwords.

1161
01:32:44,673 --> 01:32:47,074
Stuff even your lawyer didn't have.

1162
01:32:47,074 --> 01:32:48,573
But...

1163
01:32:48,974 --> 01:32:51,074
...we have it now, so we're done.

1164
01:33:04,574 --> 01:33:05,975
Bye, Nicholas.

1165
01:35:30,982 --> 01:35:33,382
Things have happened.

1166
01:35:33,382 --> 01:35:35,681
- It's important that...
- Sh, sh, sh!

1167
01:35:37,881 --> 01:35:41,682
No money, no identification,
no passport.

1168
01:35:44,382 --> 01:35:45,682
What happened to you?

1169
01:35:46,882 --> 01:35:48,382
Where to begin?

1170
01:35:50,482 --> 01:35:53,183
- It's complicated.
- It always is.

1171
01:35:57,083 --> 01:36:02,883
I was on holiday alone and
I was robbed by two men.

1172
01:36:02,883 --> 01:36:04,483
Robbed?

1173
01:36:05,183 --> 01:36:08,583
And what hotel were
you staying at?

1174
01:36:08,583 --> 01:36:10,184
I don't remember.

1175
01:36:11,983 --> 01:36:13,683
Have you gone to the police?

1176
01:36:15,384 --> 01:36:18,384
I don't speak Spanish.

1177
01:36:19,384 --> 01:36:21,983
And I just need enough
to get out of here.

1178
01:36:21,983 --> 01:36:25,684
Oh, we'll help with the local
law enforcement if you wanted to bother.

1179
01:36:25,684 --> 01:36:28,284
As far as money is concerned.

1180
01:36:28,284 --> 01:36:29,784
Can I make a suggestion?

1181
01:36:30,584 --> 01:36:33,185
You say you were mugged?

1182
01:36:33,185 --> 01:36:35,285
And they didn't take that watch?

1183
01:36:37,385 --> 01:36:39,884
How much is the watch
like that worth?

1184
01:36:39,884 --> 01:36:42,084
A couple of hundred at least.

1185
01:36:45,785 --> 01:36:48,785
Man with a watch like that doesn't
necessarily have the passport problem.

1186
01:38:15,189 --> 01:38:16,789
Excuse me?

1187
01:38:17,590 --> 01:38:19,490
Can I be attentioned please?

1188
01:38:24,690 --> 01:38:26,290
Thank you.

1189
01:38:27,490 --> 01:38:30,890
Anybody here going to San Francisco,
I need a ride?

1190
01:38:33,391 --> 01:38:38,491
I've got 18 dollars and 70... 78cents.

1191
01:38:39,791 --> 01:38:41,691
For a ride to San Francisco.

1192
01:38:47,591 --> 01:38:49,191
Anybody?

1193
01:40:36,397 --> 01:40:38,697
- Keep the change.
- Thanks, pal.

1194
01:40:42,296 --> 01:40:46,296
Conrad Van Orton.
Could you ring his room please?

1195
01:40:46,296 --> 01:40:47,997
One moment please.

1196
01:40:52,097 --> 01:40:55,297
- Is there a problem?
- You're here for Conrad Van Orton.

1197
01:40:55,297 --> 01:40:56,697
- Yes.
- I'm the hotel manager.

1198
01:40:56,697 --> 01:40:58,997
Pleasure to meet you.
Where's my brother?

1199
01:41:00,397 --> 01:41:04,798
- Will you come with me, sir?
- Wait a minute, is there a trouble?

1200
01:41:04,798 --> 01:41:07,397
Sir, this is a private matter for you.

1201
01:41:19,098 --> 01:41:22,899
There were some complaints
by other guests... damage to his room...

1202
01:41:22,899 --> 01:41:25,099
We did the best we could
to accommodate his behavior.

1203
01:41:25,099 --> 01:41:26,599
- His behavior?
- Yes, sir.

1204
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:33,500
There was an incident a few days ago.
A nervous breakdown, they said.

1205
01:41:33,799 --> 01:41:39,299
The police took him. They left
this address in case anyone came.

1206
01:41:39,299 --> 01:41:41,299
It's a hospital in Napa.

1207
01:41:42,700 --> 01:41:44,199
Terribly sorry for him.

1208
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,500
Elizabeth...

1209
01:42:02,500 --> 01:42:04,400
I need to borrow your car.

1210
01:42:05,200 --> 01:42:06,801
Nickie...

1211
01:42:07,400 --> 01:42:10,400
What happened to you?
I mean...

1212
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,201
- Look at you...
- Look at me what happened tonight?

1213
01:42:13,201 --> 01:42:15,401
I don't know.
I have these things I have to worry.

1214
01:42:15,401 --> 01:42:17,001
I need your car.

1215
01:42:17,201 --> 01:42:19,301
Of course you can have it,
if you need it.

1216
01:42:22,001 --> 01:42:23,902
Can't I get you something to eat?

1217
01:42:24,902 --> 01:42:26,902
You know you're the only person...

1218
01:42:27,401 --> 01:42:28,902
...that I can trust.

1219
01:42:30,501 --> 01:42:33,602
Everyone else...
If Sam Sutherland calls you...

1220
01:42:33,602 --> 01:42:35,702
...you don't tell him you talk to me.
You lie to him.

1221
01:42:35,702 --> 01:42:37,802
And whatever else happens
before he speaks...

1222
01:42:39,002 --> 01:42:41,102
Ok, coffee...

1223
01:42:41,102 --> 01:42:42,803
...English muffin...

1224
01:42:42,803 --> 01:42:44,302
...and your water.

1225
01:42:45,103 --> 01:42:47,103
This bottle...

1226
01:42:47,103 --> 01:42:48,803
- ...is open. Who opened this bottle?
- Yeah, I opened it.

1227
01:42:48,803 --> 01:42:51,703
I don't want an opened bottle.
I want an unopened bottle.

1228
01:42:51,703 --> 01:42:55,803
I don't want ice like this,
I want just a glass...

1229
01:42:55,803 --> 01:42:57,303
...please.

1230
01:43:00,904 --> 01:43:02,604
Nickie, talk to me.

1231
01:43:02,604 --> 01:43:04,004
You're scaring me.

1232
01:43:05,004 --> 01:43:06,704
I don't even know
what you're saying.

1233
01:43:06,704 --> 01:43:08,303
I'm sorry, Liz, I don't mean it.

1234
01:43:08,303 --> 01:43:09,904
I'm sorry.

1235
01:43:12,004 --> 01:43:14,304
You know I've been...

1236
01:43:14,304 --> 01:43:15,704
...thinking last couple of days.

1237
01:43:15,704 --> 01:43:19,004
I've had some... some spare time.

1238
01:43:22,204 --> 01:43:26,204
And I wanted to tell you...

1239
01:43:26,304 --> 01:43:28,404
...I understand why you left me.

1240
01:43:29,305 --> 01:43:30,705
And I know that I...

1241
01:43:30,705 --> 01:43:32,005
...resented it.

1242
01:43:36,805 --> 01:43:40,505
I want to apologize to you...

1243
01:43:40,505 --> 01:43:43,006
...for shutting you out...

1244
01:43:43,006 --> 01:43:44,505
...and not being there.

1245
01:43:45,505 --> 01:43:47,106
And I hope that you can forgive me

1246
01:43:47,106 --> 01:43:48,505
Yes, I...

1247
01:43:48,505 --> 01:43:50,006
<i>You've been on the go
for days.</i>

1248
01:43:50,006 --> 01:43:51,306
There's nothing to forgive.

1249
01:43:51,306 --> 01:43:52,506
<i>Then...</i>

1250
01:43:52,506 --> 01:43:54,406
<i>...pain sets in...</i>

1251
01:43:54,406 --> 01:43:57,006
<i>...the onset of a migraine pain...</i>

1252
01:43:57,006 --> 01:43:58,707
<i>If this sounds all too familiar...</i>

1253
01:43:58,707 --> 01:43:59,707
<i>...relief...</i>

1254
01:43:59,707 --> 01:44:00,807
<i>...is here at last.</i>

1255
01:44:00,807 --> 01:44:01,707
Oh, no...

1256
01:44:01,707 --> 01:44:03,206
...you bastards.

1257
01:44:03,206 --> 01:44:04,206
Battery...

1258
01:44:04,206 --> 01:44:06,406
<i>For nearly a decade
doctors have been prescribing...</i>

1259
01:44:06,406 --> 01:44:08,707
How did you find me here?

1260
01:44:09,907 --> 01:44:11,707
<i>Taggarene strong that has...</i>

1261
01:44:11,707 --> 01:44:13,707
<i>...tags... two things...muscle pain, joint pain...</i>

1262
01:44:14,807 --> 01:44:16,207
He's an actor.

1263
01:44:16,307 --> 01:44:18,407
<i>So if you trust your doctor...</i>

1264
01:44:18,407 --> 01:44:20,007
<i>...trust Taggarene.</i>

1265
01:44:21,007 --> 01:44:22,708
He's an actor on television.

1266
01:44:25,808 --> 01:44:27,407
Can't explain now.

1267
01:44:28,208 --> 01:44:29,908
Can I borrow your yellow pages?

1268
01:44:54,509 --> 01:44:59,109
Cafe, past Chinatown.

1269
01:44:59,109 --> 01:45:00,810
Get out of the car, fucker.

1270
01:45:00,810 --> 01:45:02,509
Open the door and
leave it running.

1271
01:45:02,509 --> 01:45:03,709
You're making a mistake here.

1272
01:45:03,709 --> 01:45:05,709
Now get the fuck
out of the car.

1273
01:45:05,709 --> 01:45:07,010
Get the fuck
out of the car.

1274
01:45:07,010 --> 01:45:10,410
I am extremely fragile...

1275
01:45:10,410 --> 01:45:12,010
...right now.

1276
01:45:20,811 --> 01:45:24,811
New Moon Cafe.

1277
01:45:24,811 --> 01:45:27,410
- He does commercials.
- Do you know how many customers we have?

1278
01:45:27,410 --> 01:45:28,610
Hundreds, thousands.

1279
01:45:28,610 --> 01:45:34,011
I know he ordered from you.
He went to the Montgomery Street 1019...

1280
01:45:34,011 --> 01:45:36,011
Is there anybody here
that can help me?

1281
01:45:36,011 --> 01:45:39,011
He's an actor. If I blow these people
you have here upon you...

1282
01:45:52,711 --> 01:45:54,811
Hey! Why are you taking my picture?

1283
01:45:56,512 --> 01:45:58,912
We were hoping
he would auditon today.

1284
01:45:58,912 --> 01:46:01,212
He'd really be perfect
for this part.

1285
01:46:01,212 --> 01:46:03,212
<i>Oh, this will break his heart.</i>

1286
01:46:03,212 --> 01:46:06,013
Well is there any place
we can contact him?

1287
01:46:06,013 --> 01:46:08,512
<i>Well, his beepers here
on the table.</i>

1288
01:46:08,512 --> 01:46:10,013
<i>He took the kids to the zoo.</i>

1289
01:46:10,013 --> 01:46:12,712
The zoo!
That's very very sweet.

1290
01:46:12,712 --> 01:46:15,413
<i>- Which zoo?
- Oh, it's the one with the White Tiger.</i>

1291
01:46:19,213 --> 01:46:22,213
Lyno Fisher, I love your work.

1292
01:46:24,413 --> 01:46:26,813
Ok, please...
Look, I... uh...

1293
01:46:26,813 --> 01:46:28,413
I got my kids.

1294
01:46:29,413 --> 01:46:31,214
Get rid of them.

1295
01:46:31,214 --> 01:46:33,514
Guys... uh... guys, come on,
snack time...

1296
01:46:33,514 --> 01:46:34,414
One more snacks.

1297
01:46:34,414 --> 01:46:35,914
Here, go, go, go.

1298
01:46:39,614 --> 01:46:41,714
It was just a job.

1299
01:46:41,714 --> 01:46:42,714
Nothing personal.

1300
01:46:42,714 --> 01:46:44,814
You know, I mean...
play my part...

1301
01:46:44,814 --> 01:46:50,315
- Improvise a little, I mean.
- I need to talk to who's in charge.

1302
01:46:50,315 --> 01:46:52,115
Nobody knows...

1303
01:46:52,115 --> 01:46:54,115
...and nobody gets
a big picture...

1304
01:46:54,115 --> 01:46:56,915
Hey, Tammy, Alex cut it out.
Damn it, why do they do that?

1305
01:46:56,915 --> 01:47:00,515
Offices are empty.
I need to find out where they are.

1306
01:47:03,916 --> 01:47:05,415
Ok.

1307
01:47:05,415 --> 01:47:07,515
They own the whole building.

1308
01:47:07,515 --> 01:47:09,415
They just move from
floor to floor.

1309
01:47:09,415 --> 01:47:11,316
And you work for them, right?

1310
01:47:11,316 --> 01:47:13,516
You can get me in.

1311
01:47:13,516 --> 01:47:15,416
- No, I can't.
- Oh, yes, you can.

1312
01:47:15,416 --> 01:47:18,716
You can tell them the police called.
You got to speak to someone.

1313
01:47:18,716 --> 01:47:20,816
Tell them I'm gonna
blow the whistle on them.

1314
01:47:20,816 --> 01:47:23,216
What whistle?
There's no fucking whistle.

1315
01:47:23,216 --> 01:47:25,916
This is very dangerous.

1316
01:47:27,816 --> 01:47:30,217
I don't think you understand.

1317
01:47:32,417 --> 01:47:34,517
Right now...

1318
01:47:34,517 --> 01:47:35,816
...I am...

1319
01:47:35,816 --> 01:47:37,317
...extremely...

1320
01:47:37,317 --> 01:47:38,916
...dangerous.

1321
01:47:41,817 --> 01:47:45,417
Michael, guys.
Come on, we're leaving.

1322
01:47:56,418 --> 01:47:58,118
Well, we're here.

1323
01:47:58,118 --> 01:47:59,418
Drive in.

1324
01:48:04,718 --> 01:48:07,219
What're you gonna do anyway?

1325
01:48:07,219 --> 01:48:08,818
You won't get your money back.

1326
01:48:08,818 --> 01:48:13,319
I don't care about money.
I'm pulling back the curtain.

1327
01:48:13,319 --> 01:48:16,319
I wanna meet the wizard.

1328
01:48:21,219 --> 01:48:23,619
He's eyeing us like Tiffany towers.

1329
01:48:23,619 --> 01:48:26,719
Pull in somewhere
where they won't see you.

1330
01:48:48,620 --> 01:48:50,720
Stand staff, Mr.

1331
01:48:55,521 --> 01:48:58,621
- You're not allowed to be here.
- They called me back.

1332
01:48:58,621 --> 01:49:00,621
I got a fitting.

1333
01:49:00,621 --> 01:49:02,621
He's with me.

1334
01:49:05,421 --> 01:49:07,321
- You don't need me.
- Shut up.

1335
01:49:08,322 --> 01:49:10,821
- Get in this.
- Oh, my God.

1336
01:49:11,021 --> 01:49:12,522
Cuff him to the rail.

1337
01:49:18,322 --> 01:49:20,021
What floor?

1338
01:49:38,723 --> 01:49:41,823
<i>You're fucked, you're both,
they're gonna listen!</i>

1339
01:49:43,223 --> 01:49:44,124
Where?

1340
01:49:44,124 --> 01:49:46,723
- I told you they hired me over the phone.
- Where did you pick up your checks?

1341
01:49:46,723 --> 01:49:49,324
- It was a different floor.
- Guess?

1342
01:49:49,324 --> 01:49:51,324
Like you know...
we're on this way sort of...

1343
01:49:51,324 --> 01:49:52,923
...I don't know.

1344
01:49:56,224 --> 01:49:58,123
All right, take it easy.

1345
01:50:27,125 --> 01:50:29,226
Say you're surprised.

1346
01:50:48,327 --> 01:50:50,026
Oh, fuck!

1347
01:50:52,126 --> 01:50:53,826
What are you doing here?

1348
01:50:54,627 --> 01:50:56,126
Back from the dead.

1349
01:51:06,228 --> 01:51:08,827
Nicholas, you're not
about to shoot anyone.

1350
01:51:09,527 --> 01:51:11,227
Turn around.

1351
01:51:19,328 --> 01:51:21,127
You're gonna come with me.

1352
01:51:21,828 --> 01:51:23,528
Everybody down!

1353
01:51:55,730 --> 01:51:57,330
Stop!

1354
01:52:05,530 --> 01:52:08,230
All right, what do you
think you're doing?

1355
01:52:08,230 --> 01:52:10,331
You tell me!

1356
01:52:10,331 --> 01:52:12,030
Who's behind this?

1357
01:52:12,030 --> 01:52:13,431
Who did this to me?

1358
01:52:13,431 --> 01:52:14,331
Why?

1359
01:52:14,331 --> 01:52:17,531
- What do you mean why? How deluded can you be?
- Who is responsible for this?

1360
01:52:17,531 --> 01:52:18,731
It wasn't you...

1361
01:52:18,731 --> 01:52:19,631
It wasn' t personal...

1362
01:52:19,731 --> 01:52:22,631
It could've been any asshole with
a couple of hundred million in the bank.

1363
01:52:22,631 --> 01:52:24,831
Get on my radio, all right?
You get your boss...

1364
01:52:24,831 --> 01:52:26,831
You tell them I'm gonna
shoot somebody.

1365
01:52:26,831 --> 01:52:28,431
Who am I gonna call, Nicholas?
They won't do it.

1366
01:52:28,431 --> 01:52:30,931
Oh, yes, they will!
You get somebody up here...

1367
01:52:30,931 --> 01:52:31,931
...because I'm gonna kill you.

1368
01:52:31,931 --> 01:52:33,931
They don't care about me, Nicholas.
They'll let me die...

1369
01:52:33,931 --> 01:52:36,131
You're not in a position
to threaten anyone.

1370
01:52:37,331 --> 01:52:38,331
Where'd you get that?

1371
01:52:38,331 --> 01:52:39,832
What?

1372
01:52:40,131 --> 01:52:44,032
- That gun, that's not an automatic.
- What the fuck are you talking about?

1373
01:52:44,032 --> 01:52:46,331
We all had an automatic.
Where did you get the gun?

1374
01:52:46,331 --> 01:52:47,832
This is my gun.

1375
01:52:47,832 --> 01:52:49,032
But we've searched the house.

1376
01:52:49,032 --> 01:52:51,032
Well, I guess you missed this,
didn't you?

1377
01:52:55,332 --> 01:52:56,433
This is fake.

1378
01:52:56,433 --> 01:52:57,433
It's a part of your game.

1379
01:52:57,433 --> 01:52:59,332
- Don't you start with me now.
- No, no, listen to me.

1380
01:52:59,332 --> 01:53:01,232
- Don' t you fucking start with me
- I'm telling you the truth now...

1381
01:53:01,232 --> 01:53:02,433
...this is all "the game".

1382
01:53:02,433 --> 01:53:04,633
Bullshit, all right? Bullshit!
I know what happened to that guy...

1383
01:53:04,633 --> 01:53:06,633
...they shot that guy, Feingold
whoever, they killed him.

1384
01:53:06,633 --> 01:53:08,433
- Think about it, what'd you see?
- I saw them kill him.

1385
01:53:08,433 --> 01:53:12,233
No, what'd you really, really see?
This whole time, special effects...

1386
01:53:12,233 --> 01:53:16,534
...squibs, squibs like in the movies.
Nicholas! Nicholas, listen!

1387
01:53:17,734 --> 01:53:19,834
Damn it, he's got a real gun
with the goddamned bullets...

1388
01:53:19,834 --> 01:53:21,333
...ok, ok, I'll put it down.

1389
01:53:23,534 --> 01:53:25,934
Feingold, Mr. Fisher,
he's on the other side of that door...

1390
01:53:26,034 --> 01:53:27,433
- He's an actor.
- You're trying to kill me.

1391
01:53:27,433 --> 01:53:29,834
No one's trying to kill you, Nicholas.
Please put that gun down.

1392
01:53:29,834 --> 01:53:31,634
You're about to make
the biggest mistakes of your life.

1393
01:53:31,634 --> 01:53:35,334
Nicholas, I mean there's always a safety net.
The taxi, there was a driver at my house...

1394
01:53:35,334 --> 01:53:37,134
...it's that they shot at us with blanks.

1395
01:53:37,134 --> 01:53:38,334
It's not true.

1396
01:53:38,334 --> 01:53:40,334
It is.
It's what you hired us for.

1397
01:53:40,334 --> 01:53:42,334
They're waiting
on the other side of that door...

1398
01:53:42,334 --> 01:53:44,334
...with champaign, Nicholas!

1399
01:53:45,035 --> 01:53:46,334
Please, goddamn it!

1400
01:53:46,334 --> 01:53:48,434
Conrad!
Conrad's there!

1401
01:53:48,434 --> 01:53:50,335
It's your birthday party.

1402
01:53:50,335 --> 01:53:51,835
You stop lying!

1403
01:53:54,636 --> 01:53:55,935
Let me show you.

1404
01:53:57,636 --> 01:53:59,536
Don't you move.

1405
01:54:00,235 --> 01:54:03,136
He's got a gun,
get back from the door!

1406
01:54:17,036 --> 01:54:18,537
You shot him!

1407
01:54:26,237 --> 01:54:27,237
Someone...

1408
01:54:27,237 --> 01:54:29,337
Someone call an ambulance!

1409
01:54:49,638 --> 01:54:51,338
He's dead.

1410
01:54:55,838 --> 01:54:57,839
We thought you knew.

1411
01:55:02,039 --> 01:55:05,438
How did you let this get
so out of hand?

1412
01:55:05,438 --> 01:55:08,538
He wouldn't listen to me at all.

1413
01:55:11,239 --> 01:55:13,239
Almost through this
it's over.

1414
01:55:17,840 --> 01:55:20,139
Aren't your responsibility.

1415
01:55:21,239 --> 01:55:22,740
Never...

1416
01:55:22,740 --> 01:55:25,339
Never let them mark
and take over

1417
01:55:27,439 --> 01:55:28,439
I'm sorry.

1418
01:55:28,439 --> 01:55:30,140
He could've killed us.

1419
01:55:31,740 --> 01:55:33,740
I had a walkie-talkie.

1420
01:55:34,240 --> 01:55:36,440
I used walkie-talkie.

1421
01:55:38,741 --> 01:55:40,240
We're going to jail.

1422
01:55:40,340 --> 01:55:44,041
We're all going to jail
for the rest of our lives.

1423
01:55:54,341 --> 01:55:55,742
Oh, God!

1424
01:55:57,141 --> 01:55:58,842
Nicholas!

1425
01:56:33,243 --> 01:56:34,843
<i>We've got him.</i>

1426
01:56:35,243 --> 01:56:37,543
<i>We have him there,
he came on right on target.</i>

1427
01:56:37,844 --> 01:56:39,844
<i>Standby for further
medical treatments.</i>

1428
01:56:40,744 --> 01:56:45,443
<i>Keep everyone back until we
clear away the breakaway glass.</i>

1429
01:56:45,744 --> 01:56:47,643
Mr. Van Orton,
don't open your eyes.

1430
01:56:47,643 --> 01:56:50,844
Breakaway glass,
but it can still cut you.

1431
01:56:52,344 --> 01:56:54,044
Just gonna take a look at you.

1432
01:56:54,044 --> 01:56:55,745
I'm gonna take your pulse.

1433
01:57:00,745 --> 01:57:04,444
Just take it easy,
it was a quite a fall.

1434
01:57:35,246 --> 01:57:36,946
Happy birthday, Nickie.

1435
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:51,247
What is this?

1436
01:57:52,047 --> 01:57:53,847
It's your birthday present.

1437
01:58:13,948 --> 01:58:17,148
I hurt you with something really.
I'm such an asshole

1438
01:58:28,849 --> 01:58:32,249
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother, Nicholas Van Orton.

1439
01:59:07,251 --> 01:59:11,251
Amazing, I just wanted to tell you.

1440
01:59:11,251 --> 01:59:13,351
This was the best ever.

1441
01:59:14,651 --> 01:59:16,951
Thank God, you jumped,
because if you didn't...

1442
01:59:16,951 --> 01:59:18,851
...I was supposed to
throw you off.

1443
01:59:18,851 --> 01:59:20,451
Thanks.

1444
01:59:21,251 --> 01:59:24,651
I have to head home.
I just wanted to say goodbye.

1445
01:59:24,651 --> 01:59:26,252
Rachal...

1446
01:59:26,551 --> 01:59:28,152
...sweet dreams.

1447
01:59:30,052 --> 01:59:31,651
Thanks, Mal, for coming.

1448
01:59:31,651 --> 01:59:34,052
I'm sorry about your car.

1449
01:59:34,052 --> 01:59:35,652
I left it at the zoo.

1450
01:59:35,652 --> 01:59:37,552
No problem.

1451
01:59:43,053 --> 01:59:44,953
Happy birthday, Nicholas.

1452
01:59:47,353 --> 01:59:49,852
I'll call you. I really will.

1453
02:00:05,353 --> 02:00:09,054
Nicholas, I haven't a clue
what this is all about.

1454
02:00:09,054 --> 02:00:12,554
Your taste in champaign
is excellent as always.

1455
02:00:12,554 --> 02:00:14,154
It was great entrance.

1456
02:00:15,754 --> 02:00:17,754
Yes and I want you to know
that what happened on Sunday was...

1457
02:00:17,754 --> 02:00:19,955
Oh, no, no, no, please.

1458
02:00:19,955 --> 02:00:22,654
I've never been happier
my whole life.

1459
02:00:22,654 --> 02:00:24,354
I thank you...

1460
02:00:24,354 --> 02:00:26,454
...and my wife thanks you.

1461
02:00:27,954 --> 02:00:29,455
Thank you for coming.

1462
02:00:30,455 --> 02:00:31,954
Thank you, Sam.

1463
02:00:34,555 --> 02:00:36,155
What's this?

1464
02:00:36,155 --> 02:00:37,155
This...

1465
02:00:37,155 --> 02:00:39,555
...is...

1466
02:00:39,555 --> 02:00:40,855
...the bill...

1467
02:00:42,355 --> 02:00:43,655
The bill?

1468
02:00:43,655 --> 02:00:45,156
Keep the pen.

1469
02:00:46,555 --> 02:00:47,755
Thank you...

1470
02:00:47,755 --> 02:00:49,256
...both.

1471
02:00:55,856 --> 02:00:56,955
You wanna split?

1472
02:00:56,955 --> 02:01:00,256
Oh, God, yes please.
I'll take you up on that.

1473
02:01:01,756 --> 02:01:04,456
Oh, my God!

1474
02:01:07,656 --> 02:01:10,057
Thank you, Connie.

1475
02:01:13,357 --> 02:01:15,657
What happened to that... um...

1476
02:01:15,657 --> 02:01:18,357
...waitress?
What was her name... um...

1477
02:01:18,357 --> 02:01:19,457
Christine?

1478
02:01:19,457 --> 02:01:21,557
She said something about
catching a plane.

1479
02:01:21,557 --> 02:01:24,058
I just saw her out front
waiting for a cab.

1480
02:01:43,058 --> 02:01:44,758
Christine?

1481
02:01:47,359 --> 02:01:48,958
I... um...

1482
02:01:48,958 --> 02:01:50,958
...I didn't have chance
to say goodbye.

1483
02:01:50,958 --> 02:01:52,758
Thank you. I... I... I... um...

1484
02:01:52,758 --> 02:01:55,659
You know, I never did ask you
your name, did I?

1485
02:01:55,659 --> 02:01:57,459
No.

1486
02:01:57,459 --> 02:01:58,759
It's...

1487
02:01:58,759 --> 02:02:00,159
...Clair.

1488
02:02:00,159 --> 02:02:02,759
So you... um... catching a plane or?

1489
02:02:02,759 --> 02:02:05,959
Yeah, we have a gig
starting next week in Austrailia, so...

1490
02:02:05,959 --> 02:02:07,859
Gonna sheer some more sheep.

1491
02:02:07,859 --> 02:02:09,360
Just a walk on this time.

1492
02:02:09,360 --> 02:02:11,460
Well, when you get back...

1493
02:02:14,660 --> 02:02:16,560
...maybe dinner,
we gotta have some dinner.

1494
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:20,060
You don't know
anything about me.

1495
02:02:21,060 --> 02:02:23,060
No, I don't.

1496
02:02:23,060 --> 02:02:24,660
So you tell me.

1497
02:02:24,660 --> 02:02:28,461
- Well, what...
- Where you're from?

1498
02:02:28,461 --> 02:02:29,960
Originally...

1499
02:02:29,960 --> 02:02:32,161
...O... Oklahoma.

1500
02:02:32,161 --> 02:02:33,661
Colorado?

1501
02:02:36,960 --> 02:02:39,361
I've been doing this
way too long.

1502
02:02:41,561 --> 02:02:42,961
You know... uh...

1503
02:02:45,461 --> 02:02:47,362
Would you like to...

1504
02:02:47,262 --> 02:02:49,661
...have a
coffee with me at the airport?

1505
02:03:18,563 --> 02:03:25,563
<i># One pill makes you larger

1506
02:03:26,963 --> 02:03:31,364

mother gives you...</i>

1507
02:03:31,364 --> 02:03:35,864
