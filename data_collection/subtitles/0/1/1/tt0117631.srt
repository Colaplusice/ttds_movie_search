1
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,078
I did. I did. I-I-I thought
I was a cat. Ooh.

2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,909
Well, kind of, kind of. I-I identified
with cats. Well, I kind of did.

3
00:00:40,040 --> 00:00:41,917
I wonder why that was.

4
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:43,678
They make sure you try
to stroke them. Is that right?

5
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,711
So maybe I was a sad cat. Was I
a sad cat? Because I wonder.

6
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:47,751
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
I wonder about cats.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:51,589
Truly, I did. I did. I did. I did.
'Cause I was a fuddy-duddy. Fuddy-duddy.

8
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:53,711
I kissed them all. Kissed them.
I will always kiss cats. Always did.

9
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,671
If a cat'd let me kiss it,
I'd kiss it.

10
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,920
You know, if I see a cat on
a fence, I'll kiss it. Always,
always. I will, didn't I?

11
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,432
Ooh. Life's a perpetual risk, isn't it?
That's right. I think it is.

12
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:23,835
Because the point is,
I was different in those days,
wasn't I? I was. I was. I was.

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,679
I've got... I've got to be
different again. Different again.

14
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:29,553
But can a leopard change
its spots? Who knows?

15
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,871
Ooh. It's a blood sport.
I think it's a blood sport.

16
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,956
It's true.
It seems to be true.

17
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:40,878
Or is it a blank?
Bit of a scrabble. Hoo hoo.

18
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:42,877
You've got to put all the pieces
together. See if you can make a word.

19
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,355
Ho ho, that's very...
That's very funny.

20
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,715
It's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

21
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,390
- Bye.
- Take care.

22
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,237
Bye-bye.

23
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,357
We're closed.

24
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:56,153
- What's the problem, mate?
- Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry,
mate. I'm the problem.

25
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:58,840
I think I'm the problem.
Oh, such a problem. And wet! Oh.

26
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,757
But it's not an ideal world.
Is it an ideal world?

27
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:03,155
I mean, we just have to make
the most of it. This is
the way we find it, isn't it?

28
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,077
Yeah, yeah. But I mean, it's
more ideal than it was because...

29
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,031
I mean, you know, I mean we're
privileged, we're privileged.

30
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:09,435
We're privileged, aren't we,
because not long ago people
would be burned to a stake.

31
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:11,710
- Wouldn't they, Moby? Moby, yea!
- No, no. It's Tony. Hey...

32
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,637
Tony, Tony, Tony. Not Moby.
Tony, Tony, Tony.

33
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,671
Who am I, Tony? Who knows Tony?
I don't know myself.

34
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:18,712
Ahh! I'm David. I'm David, Tony.
I'm David. How does that sound?

35
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,912
- Hi, David. How can Sylvia help?
- Sylvia. Is it Sylvia? Sylvia!

36
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:24,395
Ah, hi, Sylvia.
Pleased to meet you, Sylvia. Oh.

37
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:26,954
- Schubert, Schubert,
Schubert, wasn't it? He said,
"Who is Sylvia? What is she?"
- What...

38
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,877
- 'Course he did. 'Course he did.
- What can we do for you, David?
- Do for me. Do for me.

39
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,070
What... Ahh... Got to... Got to... I got
to stop talking. Got to stop talking.

40
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,997
- It's a problem, isn't it?
It's a problem.
- No, no, no. It's all right.

41
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,350
- You just tell Sylvia why you're here.
- Oh, well, ah, it's a mystery.

42
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,357
- Are you lost?
- It's a mystery.
Am I lost? Perhaps that's it.

43
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,708
- Yes?
- Perhaps I am lost. I'm lost.
How does that sound?

44
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:41,798
How's that sound?
Oh, is that your piano, Sylvia?

45
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,071
Beautiful Sylvia. Oh, isn't
Sylvia beautiful, Toby?

46
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,475
Not Toby, Tony. Tony. You're Tony.
You're beautiful too, Tony.

47
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:50,114
Oh, perhaps I could play it.
Could I play it? Could I play it?

48
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:52,435
- You say. You say. You say.
- Oh, like hell, baby. Go on.
- Shut up, Sam.

49
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,236
- Hell, baby. Whoa ho, the
devil. Diablerie. Oh, Sam.
- David. David.
- Get out of here. Go on.

50
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:00,033
- Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia,
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia.
- You just te... You just tell us
who you are and where you live.

51
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:04,438
Could I play? Live, live, live, Sylvia.
Live and let live. That's important,
isn't it? Molto, molto.

52
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,358
But then again, it's a lifelong
struggle. Isn't it, Sylvia?
Tony. Tony. Tony. Tony. Sylvia.

53
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,075
To-To survive. To-To live. To survive.
To survive undamaged and not to destroy
any living, breathing creature.

54
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,033
I mean, the point is, if you do
something wrong, you can be
punished the rest of your life.

55
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:16,310
- So I think it's a lifelong struggle.
Is it a lifelong struggle?
- Yes.

56
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,237
I mean, whatever you do, I think
it's a struggle. A struggle.

57
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,555
A struggle to keep your head above water
and not get it chopped off.

58
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:25,390
- I'm not disappointing you, am
I, Sylvia, Tony, Tony, Sylvia?
- Oh, no. Oh, get off!

59
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,628
Helfgott! What a name.

60
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:33,433
Sorry, Sylvia, I sound like a donkey.
Helfgott. "With the help of God."

61
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,393
That's what it means, Sylvia.
How's that? You see, Daddy's
daddy was really very religious.

62
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:40,957
Very-Very strict and-and a bit of
a meanie. But he got exterminated,
didn't he? So God didn't help him.

63
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,356
That's not very funny, Sylvia.
It's very sad, really. I'm
callous, Daddy said. Callous.

64
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,755
- Call... And a bit of a meanie. Sorry,
Sylvia. I'm not damaging you, am I?
- No, no.

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,077
I mustn't damage Sylvia.
The point is... The point is,
perhaps I haven't got a soul.

66
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,953
- What makes you say that?
- Daddy. Daddy said so. He says there's
no such thing as a soul.

67
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,913
- Oh, that's ridiculous.
- Ridiculous. You're right.
I'm ridiculous. Sylvia, Tony.

68
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:58,838
I'm callous, Daddy said. Callous,
callous. Ah, ridiculous and callous.

69
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:02,873
Because it was a tragedy. A tragedy.
A very ridiculous tragedy.

70
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,629
I'm gonna win.
I'm gonna win. Gonna win.

71
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,117
I'm gonna win.

72
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:32,230
- David's going to play the piano
for us. Aren't you, David?
- Yes.

73
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,830
What are you going
to play? David?

74
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,311
- David, what are you going to play?
- Excuse me.

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,193
Chopin's Polonaise.
Excuse me.

76
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,115
This is a disgrace.
The piano! The piano!

77
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,916
- It's a disgrace. The piano.
- This kid's good. He's great.

78
00:07:07,600 --> 00:07:09,397
He's my son.

79
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:12,556
My son.

80
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,956
Here they come.

81
00:07:29,080 --> 00:07:31,310
Did he win or lose?

82
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,193
- Margaret?
- He lost.

83
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:37,477
Now we'll cop it.

84
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:59,352
- It's your turn.
- Eh?

85
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:01,277
It's your turn, Daddy.

86
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:06,436
Ah, let me see.
Let me see.

87
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,630
Let me see.

88
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:15,118
You're losing. You're losing.
You're losing.

89
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,038
David, always win.

90
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,789
Always win.

91
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:25,196
You know, when l...
when I was a boy your age,

92
00:08:25,320 --> 00:08:27,993
I bought a violin,
a beautiful violin.

93
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,192
And I saved for this violin. And
you know what happened to it?

94
00:08:31,320 --> 00:08:34,073
Yes. He smashed it.

95
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,475
Yeah. He smashed it.

96
00:08:39,160 --> 00:08:42,709
David, you're
a very lucky boy.

97
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:45,832
- My father never let me have music.
- I know.

98
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,670
You're a very
lucky boy. Say it.

99
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:53,075
I'm a very lucky boy.

100
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:54,997
Very lucky.

101
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:00,839
- Now shall I play for you?
- No. Pick up those pieces.

102
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,510
- Bet I could've won.
- You'd have been too scared.
- Shh!

103
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,675
David! Shh.

104
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:27,597
Listen.
Have a listen.

105
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:46,355
Margaret! I told you,
tell your friends not to come.

106
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,154
Hello.

107
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:15,794
Daddy, there's
somebody here.

108
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:21,633
Hello. I hope
I'm not interrupting.

109
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:26,554
Uh, Ben Rosen.
I was one of the judges.

110
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:30,912
- Yes?
- You left before all
the prizes were announced.

111
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,759
- You were very good
this afternoon, David.
- Thank you.

112
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:36,348
- He can play better.
- Well, maybe he was a little too good.

113
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,436
Some people
don't like that.

114
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:41,950
We, ah, we gave him
a special prize for his courage.

115
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,393
- It was a difficult piece
you chose, David.
- Daddy chose it.

116
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,398
Well, even great pianists think twice
before tackling the Polonaise.

117
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,751
- A prize for losing?
- I wouldn't call him a loser.

118
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:05,754
They all... They all play.

119
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:11,352
Well, I'm quite sure David
could win lots of competitions
with the right tuition.

120
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,755
- My card.
- I teach him.

121
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:16,030
- Yeah, you've obviously done very well.
- Yeah.

122
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:21,598
- No one taught me.
No music teachers, Mr Rosen.
- No, of course.

123
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:24,553
It's just, a... It's just, a few
bad habits can sometimes mean...

124
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,513
the difference
between winning or losing.

125
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:30,598
Well, perhaps you'd, uh,
like to think about it, huh?

126
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,037
The Rachmaninoff?

127
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,151
It's beautiful.

128
00:12:13,280 --> 00:12:15,669
You... You taught yourself?

129
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:18,917
- From the record.
- Ah, yeah.

130
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,713
It's... It's very difficult.

131
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,149
It's very difficult. It's...

132
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:29,110
It's the hardest piece
in the world, you know?

133
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,037
Will you teach me?

134
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:40,957
You know, one day
you will play it.

135
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,275
You will make me
very proud.

136
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,197
Very proud.
Won't you, David?

137
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,077
Yes.

138
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:57,193
And, uh, next time...

139
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,195
what are we
going to do?

140
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,676
- We're going to win?
- We're going to win. Yes.

141
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:06,597
So...

142
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,790
good night.

143
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:11,388
Good night, Daddy.

144
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:09,357
Come. Come, come, come.

145
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:28,077
Don't touch it.
Don't touch.

146
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,032
- Yes?
- Mr Rosen, I have decided
I would like...

147
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:37,674
You teach David...

148
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,597
this.

149
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,037
Rachmaninoff?
Don't be ridiculous.

150
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:48,234
- But he can play it already.
- He's just a boy. How can he
express that sort of passion?

151
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,195
You are a passionate man, Mr Rosen.
You will teach him, no?

152
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,710
No. I will teach him
what I think is best.

153
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,274
Rachmaninoff is best.

154
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,399
But you're his teacher.
I'll let you decide.

155
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,351
Thank you.

156
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:11,036
- We'll start with Mozart.
- Mr Rosen...

157
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:12,957
I can't afford to pay.

158
00:15:39,640 --> 00:15:42,234
- Come on, David. Sylvia's getting wet.
- Oh, sorry, Sylvia. Sorry.

159
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:45,238
- Bye-bye, Tony. Bye.
- See you later.
- Oh, it's raining cats and dogs.

160
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,828
Dogs and pussycats!
Oh, look out!

161
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,670
- You'll be all right, then, David?
- Oh, I'm fine. I'm fine.
I'm fine, thank you.

162
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,995
- This is it. Home sweet home.
- Oh, you can play.

163
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,351
Oh, kind of, kind of, kin-kind
of play, k-kind, sweet Sylvia.

164
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,675
Chopin, Sylvia. Chopinzee!
The Pole. Popolski.

165
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:07,950
Like Daddy and-and his family
before they were concentrated.

166
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,514
- How long have you been here, David?
- Oh, golly, I don't know.
A few years, I think.

167
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:13,757
Eons, I suppose. How does that sound?
And Schubert. Schubert.
Nothing wrong with Schubert, of course.

168
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,677
Except syphilis.
Was it syphilis? I think it was.

169
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,473
And then he got typhoid on top
of that, so that was the end
of him, wasn't it? We lost him.

170
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,477
That was a bit careless of us,
wasn't it? We lost him.

171
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:23,034
- So you're back?
- Didn't live to swim another day.
Oh, Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.

172
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,071
I've been a naughty boy. Was I been
a naughty boy? I've been a naughty boy.

173
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:28,476
- I was about to send out a search party.
- Oh, a party. I won't be invited again.

174
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:30,716
- Will I, Sylvia?
- Came in my restaurant and
seemed a bit lost, so...
- How's that, Sylvia?

175
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:32,637
- A party. A celebration. A fiesta.
- Oh, he's very good at that.

176
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,228
- Thanks for bringing him home.
- We'll have a party tomorrow.
- Bye, David.

177
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,036
It's time for wine. A very fine time.
A Mardi Gras and a nice, long cigar.

178
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:52,079
The winner and our youngest-ever
state champion, David Helfgott.

179
00:16:56,200 --> 00:16:59,670
- Rosen, we won! We won!
- Thanks to Mozart. Hmm?

180
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,597
- And now he can play Rachmaninoff.
- Oh.

181
00:17:01,720 --> 00:17:05,315
And now to present David
with the prize money, our very
special guest from America...

182
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:10,560
ladies and gentlemen, currently on tour
in Australia, Mr Isaac Stern.

183
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:12,830
Isaac... Isaac Stern.

184
00:17:21,080 --> 00:17:24,072
- You have a very special talent, David.
- Oh, th-thank you.

185
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:27,636
Thank you, Mr Stern.
Uh, so do you.

186
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,751
How much are you prepared
to give to your music, David?

187
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:33,919
- Ah, h-how much?
- David, everything. Everything.
- Shh.

188
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:36,554
Ah, ah, ah, everything.

189
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,832
But, uh, I do like tennis
and, uh, chemistry too.

190
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,349
And do you play tennis
as well as you play Mozart?

191
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,835
Uh, l... I just play, uh,
up against the wall at home.

192
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:48,315
I, uh, I bounce the ball
against the wall, mainly.

193
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,476
How'd you like to go to a
special school in the States...

194
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,114
where music bounces
off the walls?

195
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:57,518
- A-America?
- You know, land of the free,
home of the brave.

196
00:17:57,640 --> 00:18:01,918
- Mickey Mouse?
- Ladies and gentlemen, what an
honour for our young state champion.

197
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:04,315
An invitation
to study in America.

198
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:19,429
And now, all the way
from America...

199
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,472
David Helfgott!

200
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,114
- Thank you, thank you.
- He's not from America.

201
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:29,028
But he's going to America. And when he
comes back, he'll be coming from there.

202
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,550
- Won't you, David?
- Oh, I suppose so.
- Margaret!

203
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:45,513
No, I have no money
to send him to America.

204
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:48,791
Well, uh, we'll raise it.

205
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,717
What?

206
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:59,555
Bar Mitzvah. David hasn't
yet had his Bar Mitzvah.

207
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,555
Religion is nonsense.

208
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:13,990
It's also a gold mine
if you know where to dig.

209
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:23,194
And then one day,
I-I'll play with an orchestra.

210
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:27,108
- Wow. Can I come when you do?
- You can ride in my Cadillac.

211
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:29,959
Where are you gonna
live in America?

212
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:33,390
With a nice Jewish
family, they said.

213
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:36,159
- This is not a nice family?
- Oh... Oh, yes, Daddy.

214
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:40,831
- It's very nice.
- You're very lucky
to have a family, David.

215
00:19:52,560 --> 00:19:54,357
I've got to go.

216
00:19:56,920 --> 00:19:59,992
It's one of the finest
music schools in the world.

217
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:05,114
- It is for his father to decide.
- He would be well looked after,
I assure you.

218
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,199
Rachel, please. David could be
one of the truly great pianists.

219
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:13,836
He is just a boy, Mr Rosen.
He still wets his bed.

220
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,709
- Take this one, the brown one.
- What did you... What did you do...

221
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:56,834
You see how fit I am,
how strong?

222
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:59,474
Show me where the lion scratched you
when you worked in the circus, Daddy.

223
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:03,479
Oh, yes. Come. Come.

224
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:06,194
Up, up, up, up, up.
Up-up-up-up-up.

225
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,154
Yeah. That what happens when you
get too close to the bars, eh?

226
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:13,113
David? David, come.
Come.

227
00:21:13,240 --> 00:21:15,834
Hit me.
Okay, hit me.

228
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:18,110
- Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah, as hard as you can.
- Me!

229
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,754
- I want to hit you, Daddy!
- You too. You too. You too.
As hard as you can.

230
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,678
You see, a man of steel.

231
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:27,918
No one can hurt me, because
in this world, only the fit survive.

232
00:21:28,040 --> 00:21:32,272
- The weak get crushed like insects.
- Like grasshoppers, Daddy?

233
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,472
Believe me, if you want
to survive in America...

234
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,115
you have to be
fit and strong.

235
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,596
- Like you, Daddy?
- Yeah. Yeah.

236
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,517
Like me. Yes.

237
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,150
Oh, yeah. That's good.

238
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,829
- See you next week, David.
Don't forget to study.
- Thank you, Rabbi.

239
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:44,071
Mr Helfgott, it is
exciting, isn't it?

240
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,556
David, the Lord Mayor
is dying to meet you.

241
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,709
- Peter.
- Mr Rosen.

242
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:57,755
- Ladies and gentlemen, can I
have your attention, please?
- Thank you.
- No, thank you.

243
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,556
I would like to thank our wonderful
Lord Mayor for establishing this fund...

244
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:06,150
to send David
to America.

245
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:10,398
And now, to play for us,
our very own David Helfgott.

246
00:23:13,080 --> 00:23:16,311
We have had it tuned.
I'm sure you'll find it...

247
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,631
These people are a disgrace.
They think they are so important.

248
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:44,436
What do they know with
their furs and their diamonds?
It makes me sick to the stomach.

249
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,597
And Rosen...
What kind of man is he?

250
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,757
He's not married.
He has no children.

251
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:53,672
Don't ever talk to me
about Rosen.

252
00:23:53,800 --> 00:23:57,031
He only wants for David the same
as you have always wanted.

253
00:23:57,160 --> 00:24:01,358
Don't ever compare me to him. What has
he suffered? Not a day in his life.

254
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:05,519
What does he know?
Does he know about families?

255
00:24:07,600 --> 00:24:10,956
About how
your sisters died?

256
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,355
And my mother and father?

257
00:25:23,960 --> 00:25:25,791
Thank you.
Thank you, David.

258
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:30,277
Thank you, Comrade Helfgott.
Your son is a credit to you.

259
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:36,435
On behalf of the Soviet Friendship
Society, we applaud you.

260
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,353
- Honoured to know you.
- Meet Katherine Pritchard.

261
00:25:55,080 --> 00:25:58,993
- You play beautifully.
- Ah, thank you.

262
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:01,839
- My name's Sonia.
- Oh. I-I'm David.

263
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,520
I know who you are.

264
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:07,359
You've got the most
wonderful hands.

265
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,517
So do you.

266
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:15,431
So, um, are you...
You're going to America?

267
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:20,156
- That's right, yeah.
- One day, you'll...
you'll go to Russia too.

268
00:26:20,280 --> 00:26:22,748
Why not?

269
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:27,189
David!

270
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,276
Ah, I-I'm here.

271
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:32,312
There's someone important
who wants to meet you.

272
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:35,837
I'd better go.

273
00:26:46,760 --> 00:26:51,629
I've never met anyone who plays
the piano as beautifully as you, David.

274
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:53,557
I've never met a writer
before, Mrs Pritchard.

275
00:26:53,680 --> 00:26:56,717
- You must be very proud of him.
- As proud as a father can be.

276
00:26:56,840 --> 00:27:01,356
- I have a long-suffering
old piano at home.
- Ah, a suffering piano?

277
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:05,678
From neglect. Perhaps you'll
come and play it for me one day.

278
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,756
Oh, yes.
Anything to help.

279
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,711
I'd like that very much.

280
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:12,354
Me too.

281
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:15,677
Your attention, comrades.
I wish to propose a toast.

282
00:27:15,800 --> 00:27:20,191
- That's my cue. Excuse me.
- To our founder and very
special guest this evening,
Katherine Susannah Pritchard.

283
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:23,751
You will learn much
from this old woman.

284
00:27:23,880 --> 00:27:26,440
She has been to
Soviet Union, you know.

285
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,835
Am-America!

286
00:27:53,960 --> 00:27:56,554
"We've been informed of
your exceptional talent...

287
00:27:56,680 --> 00:28:00,878
"and can only say how privileged we
feel to have you come and stay with us.

288
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:03,275
"We're sure you'll feel
very much at home here...

289
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:08,030
"and you'll be pleased to know
we're having the Bosendorfer
tuned especially.

290
00:28:08,160 --> 00:28:11,232
- We eagerly await your
'innement' arrival..."
- "lmminent," Dopey.

291
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:13,669
I wonder if they've
got a Cadillac.

292
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:18,157
"Lmminent arrival and look
forward to hearing you play for us.

293
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:21,033
Kindest wishes,
Simon and Basha Mickleburg."

294
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:25,631
- Read it again! Read it again!
- Shush! You'll wake the baby.

295
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,754
"You'll enjoy the company
of our parakeet and
our poodle, called Margaret."

296
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,836
Pig! It is not!

297
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:36,430
- Pig!
- It is too!
- Enough! Enough.

298
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:40,075
Turn it off.
Give me the letter.

299
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,997
David is not
going anywhere.

300
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,635
Daddy?

301
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:51,116
What are you looking at, you fools?
He's not going to America.

302
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:55,153
I won't let anyone
destroy this family!

303
00:28:55,280 --> 00:28:57,350
Please, Daddy, don't!

304
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:03,759
I know, David, what is best,
because I'm your father.

305
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:08,078
I'm your father,
and this is your family!

306
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:13,030
David!
David, come back!

307
00:29:13,160 --> 00:29:15,833
Come back!

308
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:22,438
I know what's best.

309
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,518
Believe me.
Close the door!

310
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:35,597
Mr Rosen!

311
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:39,917
Mr Rosen, please,
it's David!

312
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,157
Mr Rosen!

313
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,997
Time to get out, David.
It's my turn for the bath.

314
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,396
Are you feeling better now?
Have you stopped shivering?

315
00:30:33,520 --> 00:30:36,273
You know, the bath is always
the best, David. Always the...

316
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,995
You disgusting animal.

317
00:30:42,120 --> 00:30:46,557
To shit in the bath.
To do this to me.

318
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,955
You disgusting animal!

319
00:31:58,600 --> 00:32:00,397
Peter.

320
00:32:02,760 --> 00:32:05,035
I know
you can hear me.

321
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:08,077
Don't do this to David.

322
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,077
You mustn't
stop him going.

323
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,991
Peter!

324
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:35,591
Whatever you do, don't you dare inflict
bloody Rachmaninoff on him.

325
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:37,756
He's not ready.

326
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,837
David...

327
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:05,315
my boy...

328
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,510
it's a terrible thing...

329
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,437
to hate your father.

330
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:13,990
You know, life is cruel.
But...

331
00:33:15,080 --> 00:33:17,594
but music...

332
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:21,349
Music, it will always,
always be your friend.

333
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,631
Everything else
will let you down.

334
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:27,194
In the end, everything.
Believe me, everything.

335
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:33,396
Don't hate me.

336
00:33:35,520 --> 00:33:37,317
Life is cruel...

337
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,750
but you have...

338
00:33:40,880 --> 00:33:42,677
you have to...

339
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,597
you have to survive.

340
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:49,397
You have to survive.

341
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,395
Say it.

342
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:57,035
You have to survive, Daddy.
You have to survive.

343
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,277
David...

344
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,554
no one...

345
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:13,114
will love you like me.

346
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,757
You can't trust anyone.

347
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:20,237
But I will always...

348
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:23,797
be there.

349
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:28,394
David, give me a hug.

350
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:33,836
I will always be with you,
forever and ever.

351
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:37,157
Forever and ever, Daddy.

352
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:40,395
Each time you play for me...

353
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:43,557
it expresses
so completely the...

354
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,671
inexpressible.

355
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,110
- Is that good?
- It's divine.

356
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:52,073
- Inexpressibly divine.
- Er, quite.

357
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:57,675
Tell me a story,
Katherine.

358
00:35:57,800 --> 00:35:59,677
What's the story today?

359
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:03,236
A new story.
Drops of water?

360
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:05,510
Ah. Raindrops?

361
00:36:05,640 --> 00:36:07,437
Yes. Raindrops.

362
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:26,237
Perfect! I shall treasure this
till the day I die.

363
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:40,359
"To you,
all these wild weeds...

364
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:42,630
"and wind flowers
of my life...

365
00:36:42,760 --> 00:36:45,911
"I bring, my lord,
and lay them at your feet.

366
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:48,793
"They're not frankincense
or myrrh.

367
00:36:48,920 --> 00:36:52,674
"But you are Krishna,
Christ and Dionysus...

368
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:56,634
in your beauty,
tenderness and strength."

369
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,438
That was our final contestant,
David Helfgott...

370
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:37,028
with a very stirring
Rachmaninoff.

371
00:37:37,160 --> 00:37:39,799
Well, what a close
contest we have...

372
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,515
with the National Championship
almost certain to go
to one of the two pianists.

373
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,393
- Bravo, David.
- I daresay, it's going
to be difficult...

374
00:37:46,520 --> 00:37:48,351
for the judges
to separate them.

375
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:50,869
Either one,
a worthy winner.

376
00:37:51,000 --> 00:37:52,797
The judges
are now conferring.

377
00:38:02,160 --> 00:38:05,391
- It's a tough game, isn't it, Roger?
- It's a blood sport.

378
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,149
Ladies and gentlemen...

379
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,271
I'm pleased to announce
the winner of this year's...

380
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:46,517
Instrumental and Vocal
Competition.

381
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:49,029
Our new
national champion is...

382
00:38:51,600 --> 00:38:53,397
Roger Woodward.

383
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:51,835
W-What was he like,
Katherine?

384
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,230
Your father.

385
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:59,830
He was forever busy
in his study.

386
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:03,714
"Go away, Kattie, I'm writing,"
he'd always say.

387
00:40:03,840 --> 00:40:06,115
One day,
oh, I was very young...

388
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,913
I got so annoyed...

389
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:12,191
that I upset the ink pots
all over his desk...

390
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:15,073
and scrawled on his work,
pages of it.

391
00:40:16,520 --> 00:40:20,229
When he saw it, he just stood
there, seething with anger.

392
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,157
I could feel it.

393
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,590
"What are you doing?"
He shouted.

394
00:40:25,720 --> 00:40:30,396
Well, there was this
terrible silence.

395
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:34,718
And I just stared at him and said,
"Go away, Daddy. I'm writing."

396
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,990
He ran at me,
and he picked me up...

397
00:40:39,120 --> 00:40:42,317
and he cuddled me
breathless.

398
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:48,070
My first literary effort,
he always called it.

399
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,957
David, what is it?

400
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:10,197
"Royal College of Music."

401
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,997
A scholarship.

402
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:17,674
Oh, David,
that's marvellous.

403
00:41:19,720 --> 00:41:23,030
Daddy won't cuddle me,
Katherine. Oh, no.

404
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:27,073
- He can't stop you, David.
- He's such an angry lion, Katherine.

405
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:29,760
Oh, nonsense.
He's a pussycat.

406
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,637
I'll miss you.

407
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:48,034
These were for my son,
but you better have them.

408
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:51,436
It gets very, very cold
in London.

409
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,753
David?

410
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:36,509
- Where have you been?
- Um, I missed the train.

411
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:38,437
That Pritchard woman.

412
00:42:40,120 --> 00:42:42,475
What is this?
The gloves.

413
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,560
Look at me.

414
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,477
Look at me!

415
00:43:08,680 --> 00:43:13,356
And you think you can
just do as you please? Huh.

416
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,951
I-I-I wanna go, and, um,
you... you can't stop me.

417
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:20,913
What? I'm your father...

418
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:23,235
who has done
everything for you!

419
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:27,069
Everything, you cruel,
callous boy!

420
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,634
- Mum! Margaret! Mum!
- Stupid, stupid boy!

421
00:43:29,760 --> 00:43:32,513
- Mum!
- Leave him! Leave him!
- Please leave me alone.

422
00:43:36,360 --> 00:43:39,079
No, no, no, no, no.
Let him go.

423
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:41,998
- If you want to go, go! Go! Go!
- I'll call the police!

424
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,998
- Go! Go! Go!
- Stop it!

425
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:49,955
Leave him!
He's all right.

426
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:52,871
Are you all right,
David?

427
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,237
Are you all right?
Yeah?

428
00:43:56,360 --> 00:43:59,511
Come on, David.

429
00:43:59,640 --> 00:44:01,710
He's all right.

430
00:44:01,840 --> 00:44:04,434
I'm old enough
to make up my own mind.

431
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,552
He-He thinks
he's going to London.

432
00:44:07,680 --> 00:44:10,274
I've been accepted into
the Royal College of Music.

433
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:13,710
What do you think is going
to happen to you in London?

434
00:44:15,880 --> 00:44:18,952
David, if you go...

435
00:44:19,080 --> 00:44:21,799
you will never come back
into this house again.

436
00:44:21,920 --> 00:44:24,832
You will never be
anybody's son.

437
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:28,475
The girls will lose
their brother.

438
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:31,831
Is that what you want?
You want...

439
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:35,475
You want to destroy
the family?

440
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,431
I'm so... I'm sorry.

441
00:44:39,120 --> 00:44:42,874
David! David, if you love me,
you will stop this nonsense.

442
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,151
You will not step out
that... that door.

443
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:50,432
David, if you go...

444
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:52,357
you will be punished...

445
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:57,474
for the rest of your life,
my David.

446
00:44:57,600 --> 00:44:59,397
Don't go.

447
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:04,995
Sorry. I'm sorry.

448
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:11,476
David!

449
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,397
Don't make me do it!

450
00:46:17,440 --> 00:46:19,749
He has the most
fantastic hands.

451
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:22,917
Not connected to anything
above his shoulders.

452
00:46:23,040 --> 00:46:27,158
- Oh, he's a bit fragile, certainly.
- Chopinzee.

453
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:31,398
I've seen enough to suggest
that he could make the finals
in the Concerto Trials.

454
00:46:31,520 --> 00:46:34,239
And what have you seen,
Cecil?

455
00:46:34,360 --> 00:46:36,999
- Moments of genius.
- Genius?

456
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:40,390
Really.

457
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:48,471
Come on, David.
Boldness of attack.

458
00:46:48,600 --> 00:46:51,717
- Oh. Whoa! Whoa.
- Diablerie.

459
00:46:51,840 --> 00:46:54,149
- The devil, David.
- Mustn't break the piano.

460
00:46:54,280 --> 00:46:56,589
Liszt broke
plenty of strings.

461
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,915
Right, right,
right, right.

462
00:46:59,040 --> 00:47:02,316
Come on. Fill in for this
useless arm of mine.

463
00:47:02,440 --> 00:47:05,557
The notes first.
The interpretation comes on top of them.

464
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,875
On top.
Yes, yes, yes.

465
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:11,276
- You agree, do you?
- Oh, yes. I-I always agree, Professor.

466
00:47:11,400 --> 00:47:14,153
- Is that wise?
- I-I don't know. Is it?

467
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:18,194
Don't forget,
it's on the page.

468
00:47:18,320 --> 00:47:21,392
Yes. Well, the...
the notes are on the page.

469
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,671
But, ah, n-not the feeling. The emotion.
That's... That's what I feel.

470
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:27,758
You mustn't sacrifice everything to
emotion. It's all a question of balance.

471
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:30,997
Ah, yes. Is that
the question, Professor?

472
00:47:31,120 --> 00:47:34,829
- Precisely.
- Ah, ah. I thought so.

473
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,520
That's what I thought.

474
00:47:50,800 --> 00:47:52,916
Mr Helfgott,
your allowance cheque!

475
00:47:53,040 --> 00:47:54,837
Thank you, Mr Wright.

476
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,713
Sorry, sorry, sorry. Oh, I'll...
I'll just stand still if you like.

477
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,832
- Be careful, David.
- Oh. Oh, by all means, Sarah.

478
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:03,713
- You look lovely today, Sarah.
- Thank you, David.

479
00:48:03,840 --> 00:48:06,149
- You too, Muriel.
- Ease up, Helfgott. Hmm?

480
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:09,795
- Ah...
- Sarah!
- David, you missed the bank.

481
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:12,718
- Pity. You'll have to
wait until tomorrow.
- Can't bank on the bank.

482
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:16,116
- We know someone who can cash it.
- Oh, d-do we, Robert?
- What are friends for?

483
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,995
So before this dance
has reached the end

484
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,118
To you
across the floor

485
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:29,151
My love I'll send

486
00:48:32,840 --> 00:48:34,956
I just hope and pray

487
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,078
That I'll find
a way to say

488
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:41,316
Can I dance with you

489
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:11,750
Got to concentrate, K...
Got to concentrate, Katherine.

490
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:13,791
Gotta practise, practise,
practise because...

491
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:17,390
there's three important things
Professor Parkes says,
and that's work, work, work.

492
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:19,431
And-And-And, uh, so that's
what I have to do, isn't it...

493
00:49:19,560 --> 00:49:22,438
if l... if I'm gonna m... uh, make
the finals to the Concerto Medal...

494
00:49:22,560 --> 00:49:25,279
because th-the winner of which gets
to play at the Royal Albert Hall...

495
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:27,516
which is right
outside the window.

496
00:49:27,640 --> 00:49:29,790
So I-I bought
a piano, Katherine...

497
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:31,717
a-a-a beautiful piano.

498
00:49:31,840 --> 00:49:34,752
It's a suffering piano,
like yours.

499
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:38,509
Uh, I-I-I wrote to Daddy,
so, uh, that's, uh, a positive.

500
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,710
It's... It's a positive,
isn't it, because, well...

501
00:49:40,840 --> 00:49:43,400
It seems to be, because he
didn't write back. But, um...

502
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:01,473
Now how on earth did we manage
to get into the finals, dear David?

503
00:50:01,600 --> 00:50:03,716
- You're a conductor's nightmare.
- It's... It's true. It's true.

504
00:50:03,840 --> 00:50:07,833
- And what're we gonna do?
- We're gonna win, Ashley, Robert.
We-We're gonna win.

505
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:13,475
Rachmaninoff?
Are you sure?

506
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,910
Well, uh, kind of. I'm-I'm never really
sure about anything, Mr Parkes.

507
00:50:18,040 --> 00:50:21,919
The Rach' 3.
It's monumental.

508
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:25,874
It's, er, it's a mountain. It's the
hardest piece you could "Everest" play.

509
00:50:26,000 --> 00:50:29,390
Well, no one's ever been mad
enough to attempt the Rach' 3.

510
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,598
Am I mad enough,
Professor? Am I?

511
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:45,475
Think of it as two separate melodies
jousting for supremacy.

512
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:52,518
The hands, giants.
Ten fingers each.

513
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:58,157
Performing's a risk, you know.
No safety net.

514
00:50:58,280 --> 00:51:00,396
Make no mistake, David.

515
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:03,239
It's dangerous.
People get hurt.

516
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,949
You have to learn to be able
to play it blindfolded.

517
00:51:09,840 --> 00:51:12,912
The page, for God's sake!
The notes!

518
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:14,837
I'm sorry I was, uh,
forgetting them, Professor.

519
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:17,633
Would it be asking too much
to learn them first?

520
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:20,354
- And-And then forget them?
- Precisely.

521
00:51:20,480 --> 00:51:22,596
Just give me
the fingering.

522
00:52:03,160 --> 00:52:05,674
David.
Come on, my boy.

523
00:52:05,800 --> 00:52:08,155
We're going to rest
muscles and fingers today.

524
00:52:08,280 --> 00:52:10,919
Try to exercise
the imagination.

525
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:13,600
First movement, Cadenza.

526
00:52:13,720 --> 00:52:16,314
Let's pick it up
from, uh...

527
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:27,314
Your hands must form
the unbreakable habit...

528
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,273
of playing the notes so that
you can forget all about them.

529
00:52:31,880 --> 00:52:34,553
And let it come from here.
The heart.

530
00:52:34,680 --> 00:52:37,240
That's where
it comes from.

531
00:52:48,840 --> 00:52:52,276
Don't you just love
those big fat chords?

532
00:52:52,400 --> 00:52:56,313
You have to tame the piano, David,
or it'll get away from you.

533
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,035
It's a monster. Tame it,
or it'll swallow you whole.

534
00:53:05,320 --> 00:53:07,834
Coming along nicely,
David.

535
00:53:53,640 --> 00:53:55,631
Morning, Mrs Perkins.

536
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,557
Katherine.

537
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:11,191
I call this my little
mausoleum, David.

538
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:16,359
Ah, Liszt.
Warts and all.

539
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:18,755
They made this
after he was dead.

540
00:55:20,440 --> 00:55:22,556
Poor Franz.
Dead as a post, eh?

541
00:55:22,680 --> 00:55:26,275
But you can still get these
on the Left Bank, you know. Quite cheap.

542
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:36,195
I've got Rachmaninoff
in here somewhere.

543
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:44,356
Magnificent fingers.
So virile.

544
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:52,672
You know, I played the
Rach' 3 for him once.

545
00:55:52,800 --> 00:55:54,836
Really?

546
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:59,351
Yes. He said he could
hear himself in my playing.

547
00:56:01,360 --> 00:56:04,909
He said it seemed
as if I had touched his soul.

548
00:56:07,000 --> 00:56:09,309
It wasn't so bad,
was it?

549
00:56:09,440 --> 00:56:12,796
- Not too bad at all, Professor.
- Now it's your turn, David.

550
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:15,153
Remember...

551
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:18,113
once you've done it, nobody
can ever take it away from you.

552
00:56:19,800 --> 00:56:21,916
And you must play...

553
00:56:22,040 --> 00:56:24,235
as if there was
no tomorrow.

554
00:56:44,480 --> 00:56:46,277
Come on, David,
don't let me down.

555
00:56:50,880 --> 00:56:53,952
How many moments
of genius today, Cecil?

556
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:57,513
Hello?
Who is this?

557
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:02,830
- Hello?
- Daddy?

558
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:07,357
Daddy, I'm home.

559
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:10,232
Daddy?

560
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,114
Hello? Daddy?

561
01:04:21,840 --> 01:04:24,035
Someone here
to see you, David.

562
01:04:24,160 --> 01:04:26,754
It's me, David.
Suzie.

563
01:04:29,480 --> 01:04:31,675
Suzie. Suzie.

564
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:34,155
- Do we know Suzie?
- Your sister, David.

565
01:04:34,280 --> 01:04:38,353
Oh, sister Suzie. Sister Suzie. Thank
you, sister. Sister nurse. Sister Suzie.

566
01:04:44,720 --> 01:04:46,995
David, I won't be able
to come and visit so often.

567
01:04:47,120 --> 01:04:50,112
N-Not so often, sweet-sweet,
soft Suzie. Not so often.

568
01:04:50,240 --> 01:04:52,913
- I'm going to live in Melbourne.
- Oh, that's a trick. Don't tell Daddy.

569
01:04:53,040 --> 01:04:55,508
The milk, the milk.
Mustn't cry over spilt milk.

570
01:04:55,640 --> 01:04:59,315
- Ah, well, what can you do,
Margaret? What can you do?
- Margaret's in Israel, remember?

571
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,557
I remember Margaret.
She called me Dopey. Or was it a pig?

572
01:05:02,680 --> 01:05:05,399
It was a poodle.
It was a poodle. It was a poodle.

573
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,308
It was all very complicated,
wasn't it? Complicato in Israel.

574
01:05:09,440 --> 01:05:12,000
It was... It was a battleground,
war zone.

575
01:05:12,120 --> 01:05:16,318
It was a war. It was a war. Such a bore.
Such a bore. It was a war. It was a war.

576
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:19,079
It just destroys everything
really, doesn't it?

577
01:06:43,560 --> 01:06:45,551
- David.
- That's right, nurse. That's right.

578
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,399
- I knew I'd find you here.
- Oh, I've been a naughty boy
again, haven't I?

579
01:06:48,520 --> 01:06:50,909
I-I've misbehaved, haven't I, nurse?
I think I have. That's true, isn't it?

580
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:52,996
- Come on, David.
- I-I might get into trouble.

581
01:06:53,120 --> 01:06:55,554
I might... I might get punished for
the rest of my life, because I'm flawed.

582
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,592
- I'm-I'm fatally flawed.
That's right, isn't it?
- Oh, you silly sausage.

583
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,517
Because it...
it's f-f-forbidden fruit.

584
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,756
The doctor said
it's forbidden fruit.

585
01:07:19,800 --> 01:07:22,997
'Cause the thing is, he was... he was...
He-He didn't approve, did he?

586
01:07:23,120 --> 01:07:27,272
He didn't approve. He was...
He was very disapproving.
Oh, was he ever disapproving.

587
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:30,153
They'd all scuttle away
and they'd all leave me there.

588
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,517
Oh, so you can
read music?

589
01:08:00,640 --> 01:08:03,234
Oh, kind of. Kind of. Perhaps I'm
just turning over a new leaf.

590
01:08:03,360 --> 01:08:05,590
Oh, but that's all right,
isn't it?

591
01:08:05,720 --> 01:08:07,676
My name's Beryl Allcott.
What's yours?

592
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:10,473
Allcott. Allcott. Oh,
that sounds a lot like my name.
Helfgott. That's my name, Beryl.

593
01:08:10,600 --> 01:08:12,591
- Helfgott?
- That's right. Ridiculous, isn't it?

594
01:08:12,720 --> 01:08:14,915
It means "with the help of God."
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

595
01:08:15,040 --> 01:08:17,156
- I love this tune.
- What's your first name, Mr Helfgott?

596
01:08:17,280 --> 01:08:20,192
Ridiculous, isn't it? Oh, yes,
first things first, Beryl.
Uh, David. I'm David. I'm David.

597
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,914
How's that sound?

598
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:25,031
- You're David Helfgott?
- That's right, Beryl. That's right.

599
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:28,470
- That's right. That's right.
- But I used to watch you win
all those competitions.

600
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,398
Oh, win some, lose some. You can't
lose them all. It's not your fault.

601
01:08:31,520 --> 01:08:33,988
I was quite a fan.

602
01:08:37,760 --> 01:08:40,320
- Do you still play?
- Oh, I mustn't.
The doctor said I mustn't.

603
01:08:40,440 --> 01:08:42,078
- It'll all end in tears if I misbehave.
- You mustn't?

604
01:08:42,200 --> 01:08:44,077
I mustn't harangavate the doctor.
I mustn't. That's right.

605
01:08:44,200 --> 01:08:46,270
That's right. Is-ls that right?
I think it's right,
be-because it might damage me.

606
01:08:46,400 --> 01:08:49,153
The doctor said it might
damage me because it did
a long time... a long time ago.

607
01:08:49,280 --> 01:08:52,078
Once before. Long, long, long,
long time ago. That's the story,
so what can you do?

608
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:54,395
Let's see you play, Beryl.
Come on, you play.

609
01:08:54,520 --> 01:08:56,511
Boldness of attack.

610
01:08:59,680 --> 01:09:02,069
Oh, that's good, Beryl.
That's good.

611
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:04,919
Oh, very good left hand.
Very good left hand.

612
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:07,554
The point is, you see,
you've got to share and care and
care and share and just behave.

613
01:09:07,680 --> 01:09:10,319
That's right, isn't it, Beryl?
That's right. That's right. Yes.

614
01:09:10,440 --> 01:09:13,159
Oh, this is going to be a
stylish marriage. This is... Ah,
it's a stylish marriage, Beryl.

615
01:09:13,280 --> 01:09:15,350
It's a stylish marriage.

616
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,471
Oh, that's very good, Beryl.
Very good.

617
01:09:17,600 --> 01:09:19,909
Oh, it's very good.

618
01:09:20,040 --> 01:09:22,998
Oh, it's very good. Oh, press those
pedals. Oh, we're on the bicycle, Beryl.

619
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:25,634
We're on the bicycle, Beryl.
Pedal, Beryl. Pedal.

620
01:09:25,760 --> 01:09:27,716
What goes on
in his head?

621
01:09:27,840 --> 01:09:31,913
God only knows. He's pretty confusing
at the best of times.

622
01:09:32,040 --> 01:09:34,838
It's a complex disorder. He kind of
lives in his own little world.

623
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:37,554
- Poor lost soul.
- Mmm. He's a sweetie.

624
01:09:37,680 --> 01:09:40,194
He could leave tomorrow
if he had somewhere to go.

625
01:09:46,720 --> 01:09:49,473
- Come along, David.
- Beryl, Beryl, Beryl.

626
01:09:51,320 --> 01:09:55,393
- David, you know I can't abide smoke?
- Oh, sorry, Beryl. Sorry.

627
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:57,476
- What are you doing?
- I'll walk. I'll walk.

628
01:09:57,600 --> 01:10:00,239
- But you don't know the way.
- I'll follow you. How does that sound?

629
01:10:00,360 --> 01:10:01,952
Oh!

630
01:10:02,080 --> 01:10:05,516
It's all right.
Get in, David.

631
01:10:07,240 --> 01:10:10,835
Oh, God bless you,
David Helfgott.

632
01:10:10,960 --> 01:10:13,235
How's this, Beryl?
Is this all right?

633
01:10:31,840 --> 01:10:35,230
- Is that you, nurse?
- It's all right, David. I'm here.

634
01:10:35,360 --> 01:10:38,989
Oh, here, here, never fear.
Oh, but where's the nurse?
Where's the sister, Beryl?

635
01:10:39,120 --> 01:10:41,634
- This is where you live now, David.
- Oh, that's right.

636
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:44,797
I'm fine. I'm fine. I'm fine, aren't I,
Daisey? Daisey Beryl Daisey.

637
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:47,388
This is where David Helfgott
really gets back on the rails.

638
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:50,273
- Oh, that's the story.
That's the story.
- No.

639
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:56,195
Oh, that's good, Beryl.

640
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,712
Oh, don't you just love
those big fat chords, Beryl?

641
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:47,151
The Botanical Garden's
just down the road. Nice walk.

642
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:50,272
You'll be able to come
and go as you please.

643
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,551
Mr Minogue's a lovely man,
a real Christian gentleman.

644
01:11:53,680 --> 01:11:56,148
I know you're going
to like him, David.

645
01:11:56,280 --> 01:11:59,716
And guess what?
You'll even have your own piano.

646
01:12:40,040 --> 01:12:43,874
Very, very, very feathery.
Very feathery. Very light.

647
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:04,230
Stop it, David!
Shut up!

648
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,956
Good morning, David.
Wakey-wakey.

649
01:13:08,080 --> 01:13:11,470
Rise and shine,
it's breakfast time.

650
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:15,718
I think it's about time we gave
that piano another rest, eh, David?

651
01:13:15,840 --> 01:13:17,671
Here, sign your cheque.

652
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:20,268
Ah, look at you.
You should get out and exercise.

653
01:13:20,400 --> 01:13:21,913
Ah, exercise.
Yes, that's right.

654
01:13:22,040 --> 01:13:24,156
Get some fresh air into
those lungs of yours, David.

655
01:13:24,280 --> 01:13:27,238
Be-Because the weak get crushed
like insects, don't they?

656
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,157
Like grasshoppers.

657
01:14:57,040 --> 01:14:59,554
Oh, thank you,
thank you, thank you.

658
01:14:59,680 --> 01:15:03,150
- I hope you enjoyed the music.
- It was great.

659
01:15:03,280 --> 01:15:05,157
- Bye.
- See you soon.

660
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,677
We're closed.

661
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,234
Sylvia,
your stray dog's back.

662
01:16:13,360 --> 01:16:15,590
- You want me to get rid of him for you?
- No. I'll handle it.

663
01:16:18,080 --> 01:16:19,593
Hey, baby,
what about a tune?

664
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:22,154
A tune, baby. Sure.
No worries. No worries.

665
01:16:28,320 --> 01:16:30,880
Bravo. Bravo. Encore.

666
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:32,831
Oh, sock it to us,
Liberace.

667
01:16:32,960 --> 01:16:35,713
That's enough.
David?

668
01:17:46,120 --> 01:17:47,712
Fantastic!

669
01:17:56,320 --> 01:17:58,709
Thank you.
Thank you.

670
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:01,996
Two more when
you're ready, mate.

671
01:18:16,240 --> 01:18:18,196
Thank you.
Thank you.

672
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:37,637
- Oh, a hot one. A live one.
- Hey, hey, give us Beethoven's Fifth.

673
01:18:37,760 --> 01:18:40,354
Sure, babies. No worries.
Symphony or concerto?

674
01:19:17,840 --> 01:19:20,274
I played quite well tonight,
didn't I? I played quite well.

675
01:19:20,400 --> 01:19:23,392
So, l... So, I deserve a bit of a snack...
a bit of a snack. You say...

676
01:19:27,200 --> 01:19:28,428
Hello, David.

677
01:19:30,440 --> 01:19:32,396
Hello, Daddy.
H-Hello.

678
01:19:35,080 --> 01:19:36,877
Are you feeling well?

679
01:19:38,520 --> 01:19:40,875
Well, well, well, well.
Th-The thing is th-the lid.

680
01:19:41,000 --> 01:19:43,195
I can't... I can't... I can't open it.
There's something wrong with it.

681
01:19:43,320 --> 01:19:45,117
What could be wrong,
David?

682
01:19:45,240 --> 01:19:47,834
Oh, it's-it's a mystery.
It's a mystery.

683
01:19:47,960 --> 01:19:49,757
Close it.

684
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,798
Give it to me.
I'll show you.

685
01:19:56,040 --> 01:19:58,600
Hmm. Here.

686
01:20:13,400 --> 01:20:16,392
You see...
how easy it is?

687
01:20:16,520 --> 01:20:20,229
Couldn't be... Couldn't be easier.
That's right. Couldn't be easier.

688
01:20:20,360 --> 01:20:22,237
David.

689
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,077
Here. Here.

690
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:40,874
Look at me.
You are a lucky boy, David.

691
01:20:41,000 --> 01:20:43,309
That's true. That's true.
It seems to be true. People...

692
01:20:43,440 --> 01:20:45,590
People say that-that-that-that...
They think that...

693
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:48,518
David, get to the point.

694
01:20:48,640 --> 01:20:51,234
Yeah, I'm a very
lucky boy.

695
01:21:00,120 --> 01:21:04,193
No one will love you like me.
No one like me.

696
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:15,080
You see...

697
01:21:15,200 --> 01:21:20,228
do you realize what for
an opportunity you have here?

698
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:23,875
- Opportunity of a lifetime.
That's right, Daddy.
- David.

699
01:21:25,320 --> 01:21:27,117
When I was a boy...

700
01:21:30,240 --> 01:21:32,674
I-I bought a violin.

701
01:21:33,640 --> 01:21:35,551
Beautiful violin.

702
01:21:35,680 --> 01:21:37,875
I saved...

703
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:41,957
for this violin.

704
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,036
Now, you know what...

705
01:21:45,440 --> 01:21:49,638
What happened to it?
You know what happened to it?

706
01:21:53,760 --> 01:21:55,557
No. What happened to it, Daddy?
I don't... No idea...

707
01:21:55,680 --> 01:21:58,148
What happened?
I've got no idea.

708
01:22:07,720 --> 01:22:10,029
The-The thing... The thing is,
you've got to be... You've got to be
fit to survive, haven't you?

709
01:22:10,160 --> 01:22:12,435
To stay alive.
That's right, isn't it?

710
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:45,270
Good night, Daddy.

711
01:22:52,760 --> 01:22:55,991
- Where are the kids?
- Oh, around somewhere
amusing themselves.

712
01:22:58,440 --> 01:23:01,113
Oh, I must warn you.
I've got someone staying on weekends.

713
01:23:01,240 --> 01:23:05,518
- But not another Scorpio, is he?
- Oh, very funny, Gills.
He's a child prodigy.

714
01:23:07,520 --> 01:23:09,317
David?

715
01:23:12,480 --> 01:23:13,799
Oh, thanks.

716
01:23:13,920 --> 01:23:16,434
It's a madhouse.
David?

717
01:23:29,080 --> 01:23:32,072
Is that
the water running?

718
01:23:32,200 --> 01:23:33,713
David!

719
01:23:35,760 --> 01:23:38,433
David.
David?

720
01:23:40,760 --> 01:23:42,716
Where in God's heaven
is he?

721
01:23:58,680 --> 01:24:02,036
Mum! Mum! David's been on
for an hour straight!

722
01:24:02,160 --> 01:24:05,436
- He's so cool!
- David?

723
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:08,074
Is that you, Doctor?
There's no more hot water, Sylvia.

724
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,033
- Where does it go?
- David, I want you to meet someone.

725
01:24:11,160 --> 01:24:14,232
There's no more hot water, Sylvia.
It's all gone. All gone. All gone.

726
01:24:14,360 --> 01:24:17,193
Where does it go? Who can say? I don't
know. Where-Where does hot water go?

727
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,151
Gillian... Gillian's
a very dear friend of mine.

728
01:24:19,280 --> 01:24:21,510
- Oh, a friendly doctor.
I feel better already.
- I'm pleased to meet you, David.

729
01:24:21,640 --> 01:24:23,437
- No, she's not a doctor.
- Oh, not a doctor, sweet Sylvia.
Not a doctor.

730
01:24:23,560 --> 01:24:25,357
- No, no. She's an astrologer.
- Oh, a specialist. A heart surgeon.

731
01:24:25,480 --> 01:24:27,596
- She's from Sydney.
- Oh, an open-heart surgeon.

732
01:24:27,720 --> 01:24:30,075
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Oh, I'm ridiculous.
I'm ridiculous, aren't I?
- Gillian.

733
01:24:30,200 --> 01:24:32,634
- Gillian, that's it.
- If you're lucky, Gillian might
do your chart for you.

734
01:24:32,760 --> 01:24:35,752
- Oh, would she, Sylvia? Would she?
- You will, won't you, Gillian?
- Of course I will, David, yes.

735
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:37,996
- What sort of chart, Sylvia?
What sort of chart?
- An astrological chart.

736
01:24:38,120 --> 01:24:40,953
- Oh, the stars, the stars. I love
the stars. Astronomical variations.
- And the planets.

737
01:24:41,080 --> 01:24:43,913
Oh, the planets. I mustn't forget
the planets. Of course. Of course.
Mercury and Neptune and so forth.

738
01:24:44,040 --> 01:24:46,156
Oh, the Music of the Spheres. The
music... If music be the food of love...

739
01:24:46,280 --> 01:24:48,077
Oh, very gastronomical,
isn't it, Gillian?

740
01:24:48,200 --> 01:24:51,192
Oh, the food of love.
It is, Gillian. Oh.

741
01:24:51,320 --> 01:24:54,232
What's he like
when he gets to know you better?

742
01:25:45,640 --> 01:25:49,838
- So, what does he do?
- Ah, he's an investment advisor.
That's how I met him.

743
01:25:49,960 --> 01:25:53,316
Oh. So far so good.
How serious is it?

744
01:25:53,440 --> 01:25:55,749
Oh, come on, Gills.
On a scale of one to ten.

745
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:01,829
I'll take that as a ten.
When's the happy day?

746
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:05,032
Ah, you know me.
I hate to rush into things.

747
01:26:08,720 --> 01:26:10,472
I won't kiss you.

748
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,272
Oh, Trish, Trish,
Trish, Trish.

749
01:26:16,400 --> 01:26:18,834
Lovely, gorgeous hair. Blondes have more
fun, don't they? They have more fun.

750
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:20,757
Of course they do.
Of course they do.

751
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:22,677
There you are, Doctor.

752
01:26:25,720 --> 01:26:28,757
Oh, got to get to my room.
Got to get to my room.

753
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:35,476
Oh, good night, Lucy.

754
01:26:51,240 --> 01:26:54,312
- Mind if I come in?
- Oh, hello, Doctor.
Entree. Entree. Entree.

755
01:26:54,440 --> 01:26:56,556
Where will I put these?
Oh, sorry.

756
01:26:56,680 --> 01:27:00,673
It's not your fault, not
your fault. It's amazing. It
just seems to be getting bigger.

757
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:03,394
It's amazing who you find, isn't it,
when you're not even looking?
But there he is. There he is.

758
01:27:03,520 --> 01:27:05,511
- Who?
- Roger. Roger. Roger. Roger.

759
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:09,189
- Oh, Roger Woodward.
- Oh, Roger, Roger.
Yeah, he's-he's a winner.

760
01:27:09,320 --> 01:27:11,470
- He's a winner.
- You've got one going already.

761
01:27:11,600 --> 01:27:14,478
He's-He's-He's a big hit.
He's a big hit. Big hit.

762
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:16,431
Oh. Oh. One's...
One's more than enough.

763
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:19,120
Yeah. I really loved
your playing.

764
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:21,515
Did you? Did you?
It was all right?

765
01:27:21,640 --> 01:27:24,712
- Oh, do you write music as well?
- Oh, no. One, two, three.
Oh, that's the Rach' 3.

766
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,910
- That started out being a letter.
- A letter, Gillian?

767
01:27:27,040 --> 01:27:29,031
Yes, I think... I think it was.
I think so. It seems to be true.

768
01:27:29,160 --> 01:27:32,470
- "Dear Professor Cecil, Royal College."
- Of Music. Royal College of Music.

769
01:27:32,600 --> 01:27:34,397
- Yeah, that's a mystery.
That's a mystery.
- What is?

770
01:27:34,520 --> 01:27:36,431
Well, he only had one arm, you see.
It was a stroke... stroke of bad luck.

771
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:39,996
- Poor thing.
- Yeah. Poor, poor pussycat.
Poor, poor pussycat. He was...

772
01:27:40,120 --> 01:27:42,998
His-his paw was damaged
beyond repair. He wasn't able
to do a thing with it, you know.

773
01:27:43,120 --> 01:27:45,873
He was... He was a sad, sad pussycat.
He was... He was damaged.

774
01:27:46,000 --> 01:27:48,195
And it was just-just
bad luck really, wasn't it?

775
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:52,233
- I'm not damaging you, am I?
- Oh, no. Not at all.

776
01:27:52,360 --> 01:27:54,794
- What's the matter, David?
- Oh, the matter,
the matter, the matter.

777
01:27:54,920 --> 01:27:56,956
Well, it started out being... But it's
a blank. It's a blank. It's a blank.

778
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:59,150
It was all... It was all such a long,
long, long, long time ago, Gillian.

779
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:01,157
So that's the story.
What can you do?

780
01:28:01,280 --> 01:28:04,397
Inexpressible.
Inexplicably inexpressible.
To express the inexplicable.

781
01:28:04,520 --> 01:28:06,670
Well, why don't you tell me
what you want to say?

782
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,189
Oh, why not? Why not? Wh-What don't
I want to say? Oh, that's a hard one.

783
01:28:09,320 --> 01:28:12,278
No, it's not hard at all.
Look. "D.E.A.R. Dear."

784
01:28:12,400 --> 01:28:15,437
- That's it. That's it. That's it. Dear.
Dear. Dear. Oh, deary me. Deary me.
- Dear Cecil? Cecil.

785
01:28:15,560 --> 01:28:17,437
- Parkes. Cecil was Parkes. Mr Parkes.
- Dear Mr Parkes.

786
01:28:17,560 --> 01:28:20,233
He touched the soul of
Sergei Vasilievitch himself
with the Rach' 3 in D Minor.

787
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:23,158
So that wasn't too bad, was it?
It's a hard piece. Piece
for elephants. Elephantine.

788
01:28:23,280 --> 01:28:25,999
- D-Dear Mr Parkes...
- It's all such a long time ago.
Such a long time, you know?

789
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:28,918
- It has been such a long time.
- It has. That's right. That's
right. Such a long time, yeah.

790
01:28:29,040 --> 01:28:32,476
- And l...
- Oh, and l... and I hope...
Hope, hope, Gillian.

791
01:28:32,600 --> 01:28:34,636
- How does that sound?
Is that all right?
- It sounds pretty good to me.

792
01:28:34,760 --> 01:28:37,433
And I hope you remember me
a-and the Rach' 3.

793
01:28:37,560 --> 01:28:39,994
I'm-I'm-I'm feeling much better
again now. I'm feeling much
better again, aren't I?

794
01:28:40,120 --> 01:28:43,271
And-And-And a-a...
I've started playing again.

795
01:29:10,480 --> 01:29:14,632
Well done, Roger.
Oh, yeah. Oh.

796
01:29:16,560 --> 01:29:18,357
That was good.

797
01:29:43,200 --> 01:29:44,553
- Smile, David.
- Come on.

798
01:29:44,680 --> 01:29:46,716
- I am, Sylvia.
- At the camera. Here. Here.

799
01:29:46,840 --> 01:29:49,035
- Oh.
- Hooray!

800
01:29:49,160 --> 01:29:51,151
- Time to go.
- Oh, well, what can you do?
What can you...

801
01:29:51,280 --> 01:29:52,838
- David, look on the bright side.
- On the bright side. The silver lining.

802
01:29:52,960 --> 01:29:55,554
- You'll see Gillian again one day.
- Yes. Life goes on.

803
01:29:55,680 --> 01:29:57,989
- It does, it does.
Is that what it does?
- Yes, of course it does.

804
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:00,395
- David, she has to go.
- Oh, yeah.
Little wrigglies to look after.

805
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:03,830
Well, hardly. No, my kids are all
grown up. It's just little old me.

806
01:30:03,960 --> 01:30:06,758
It's just me too.
I never grew up. I grew down.

807
01:30:06,880 --> 01:30:10,668
Ha-ha! I'm a bit of a handful...
bit of a handful, Gillian, aren't I?

808
01:30:10,800 --> 01:30:13,678
Softly. Softly. Softly.
Softly.

809
01:30:15,400 --> 01:30:17,595
Will you marry me?

810
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:22,550
Well, it wouldn't be
very practical, David.

811
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:25,911
Practical? No, of course not.
Of course not. But then neither
am I, Gillian. Neither am I.

812
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:29,032
- I'm not very practical at all.
- You'll miss the plane.

813
01:30:29,160 --> 01:30:32,835
It's sweet of you, David.
I don't know what to say.

814
01:30:32,960 --> 01:30:35,520
The stars, Gillian darling.
Ask the stars.

815
01:32:06,760 --> 01:32:09,399
- You'd better let her breathe, David.
- Hooray!

816
01:32:17,800 --> 01:32:19,916
I won't kiss you.
I won't kiss you.

817
01:32:42,440 --> 01:32:45,193
- Sorry, darling.
- That's all right.

818
01:32:46,800 --> 01:32:51,590
You made a noise.
You went, "Oh, David."

819
01:33:08,240 --> 01:33:10,629
Oh, no.
Poor Ravel.

820
01:33:10,760 --> 01:33:13,593
Oh, poor Maurice.
He's all unraveled, all unraveled.

821
01:33:13,720 --> 01:33:15,551
- It's nearly time to get ready.
- Poor, wet sausage.

822
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:18,114
- Can I swim some more, darling?
- Oh, all right. Ten minutes.

823
01:33:18,240 --> 01:33:20,959
Do some Liszt.
Not a concerto.

824
01:33:21,080 --> 01:33:24,231
Swim "La Campanella."
Oh, that should do it.

825
01:33:28,240 --> 01:33:30,196
Oh, I've gone wrong, darling.
I've gone wrong.

826
01:33:30,320 --> 01:33:32,880
- Keep trying, darling.
- I'm trying. I'm very trying.

827
01:33:33,000 --> 01:33:34,638
Page 37's missing.

828
01:33:34,760 --> 01:33:38,070
Oh, it's the coda. It's the end.
It's the beginning of the end.

829
01:33:38,200 --> 01:33:41,590
- I'll soak my hands.
I'll soak my hands.
- David?

830
01:33:46,840 --> 01:33:48,159
Got ya!

831
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:54,910
Your first concert in years
and you wear odd shoes.

832
01:33:55,040 --> 01:33:57,190
- Oh, I'm a sausage.
- You certainly are.

833
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,788
- Sit! Darling, up straight.
- Oh, sit up straight. Sit up straight.

834
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:02,150
- We'll-We'll be in the car.
- Sit up straight. Sit up
straight. Sit up straight.
- Relax.

835
01:34:02,280 --> 01:34:04,714
Oh, relax. I must learn to relax.
Must learn to relax.

836
01:34:06,520 --> 01:34:08,317
Perfect.

837
01:34:54,280 --> 01:34:56,077
Bravo!

838
01:34:59,880 --> 01:35:01,677
Bravo!

839
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:11,193
- Hi, darling.
- Oh, they want an encore.

840
01:35:11,320 --> 01:35:13,117
Do they, darling?
They want some more?

841
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:15,037
- What are you going to do?
- I'm going to win.

842
01:35:15,160 --> 01:35:16,798
Not now, darling.

843
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,990
- I'll do some more. I'll do some more.
- Do some more.

844
01:36:16,680 --> 01:36:18,557
What do you feel?

845
01:36:18,680 --> 01:36:20,750
The thing is,
I feel nothing.

846
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,711
Nothing at all?

847
01:36:22,840 --> 01:36:26,833
Well, I'm shocked, stunned and
completely amazed. How's that sound?

848
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,394
Perhaps it's all my fault.
Perhaps it's me. Perhaps I don't know.

849
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:31,909
You can't go on blaming yourself
for everything that's happened.

850
01:36:32,040 --> 01:36:33,996
Well, you can't go on blaming yourself.
That's-That's true, Gillian.

851
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,031
And you can't go on blaming Daddy,
because he's not here anymore.

852
01:36:36,160 --> 01:36:38,799
- But you are.
- Oh, I am here. That's true. Oh!

853
01:36:38,920 --> 01:36:41,150
And-And life goes on, doesn't it,
Gillian? Is that right? Is that right?

854
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,998
- Yes.
- It does? It does? Forever and ever?

855
01:36:43,120 --> 01:36:45,759
- No, not forever.
- No-No-No, never forever.
Not quite. Not quite.

856
01:36:45,880 --> 01:36:47,916
But I mean, the point is, life's
not all lamb loin chops, is it?

857
01:36:48,040 --> 01:36:50,838
But I mean, it goes on, and-and you just
have to keep on going too, don't you?

858
01:36:50,960 --> 01:36:52,757
- I mean, you can't give up, can you?
- Certainly not.

859
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,792
Every time that blooming Saturn comes
along and gives us a bit of a jolt.

860
01:36:55,920 --> 01:36:57,831
Oh, it's the stars,
Gillian.

861
01:36:57,960 --> 01:37:00,599
- Everything has its season.
- Oh, it's a mystery. It's a mystery.

862
01:37:00,720 --> 01:37:04,110
- There's always a reason.
- Oh, we just need to seize
the reason for the season.
