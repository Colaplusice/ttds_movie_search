1
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,168
Hey, Sheriff.

2
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,811
("Chair scraping on floor)

3
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,412
A Mercury is a real good car.

4
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,683
That was the car I was driving that day.

5
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,024
I have a lot of cars.

6
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,361
Yeah. Different kinds.

7
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,261
A lot of different kinds of cars.

8
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,305
She was standing, this girl,

9
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,537
on the side of the street where
there was this chicken stand.

10
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,941
It wasn't the Colonel, but it
was a chicken stand nevertheless.

11
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,981
And I pulled the Mercury
right up alongside

12
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,484
and I rolled down the window,
see, by electric power.

13
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,716
And she had this leather skirt on.

14
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,781
And she had a lot of hair on her arms.

15
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,855
I like hair, I like hair a lot. It
means a big bush. I like a big bush.

16
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:24,829
So she says, "Are you dating?" You know?

17
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,099
I said, "Sure." So she gets in.

18
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:32,440
And we pull off into this
remote location, you know,

19
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,776
that was comfortable for both she and I.

20
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,214
And she says to me, "How
much do you wanna spend?"

21
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,913
And I said, "Whatever it takes to see that
bush of yours, 'cause I know it's a big one."

22
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,980
And she says to me, "25 dollars."

23
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:52,030
That's not chicken feed,
you know... to a working man.

24
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:57,434
So I produce the 25 dollars and she sticks
it down into her shoe and pulls up her skirt.

25
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,904
And there before me lay this thin,

26
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,966
crooked, uncircumcised penis.

27
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,585
You can imagine how bad I
wanted my 25 dollars back, huh?

28
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,718
("Girl) I don't know why you're so
weirded out. This is not San Quentin.

29
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,489
It's just a nut house. Most of these
people don't even know where they are.

30
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,053
They're not gonna hurt you.

31
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,294
In a few minutes, we're gonna be in a room
with a killer. That doesn't bother you?

32
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,996
Hey, you're the one that
wanted to major in journalism.

33
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,570
These are the people
from that newspaper deal.

34
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,136
- Oh, yeah. From the college?
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,205
- I'm Jerry Woolridge.
- Nice to meet you.

36
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,649
I'm Marsha Dwiggins and
this is Theresa Evans.

37
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,448
She's here to take the pictures.

38
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,853
Y'all sit down.

39
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,121
Yeah, there was a young
man named John Legit Hunter

40
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,957
who was in the filling station business
- a good filling station business.

41
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,362
But he was one of these young
men we run across in life,

42
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm sure you've run across 'em, who
didn't deserve what he had, you know?

43
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:07,202
And one of the things he had was this...

44
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,264
beautiful young bride,

45
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,106
Sarah.

46
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,078
She was a Georgia peach.

47
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,949
In fact, she was more like the picture I
had in my mind than any woman I'd ever seen.

48
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,477
So I took it upon myself to take
her away from John Legit Hunter,

49
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,457
who did not deserve her, you know?

50
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh, I don't know if I told you,

51
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:34,258
but he was a Frenchman who
claimed to be an Englishman.

52
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,662
Yeah... Took a lot of strong nylon
cord to get her away from him,

53
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:44,472
'cause she was a fighter as
well as being a Georgia peach.

54
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,939
I think there must have
been a little mix-up.

55
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,986
I talked to your sponsor or
teacher, or whoever he is,

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,489
and I told him that there
couldn't be any pictures.

57
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,961
It's supposed to be like an article or a
story, something like that, isn't that right?

58
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,362
Well, yeah, it's for the school
newspaper, but it has pictures.

59
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,764
I mean, it's a regular paper, you know?

60
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,360
Karl's real sensitive about
having his picture made.

61
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,873
He wouldn't even be on the bulletin
board for the Easter collage.

62
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,841
Now...

63
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,508
a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

64
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,856
All I can do is talk to
him, see what he says.

65
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,922
You gotta make something
explode to truly understand it.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,996
I mean, you gotta examine all those little
tiny particles while they're still on fire.

67
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,065
("Guard) Karl, I've gotta take
you down to the old classroom.

68
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:55,046
Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see down there.

69
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,275
Come on, let's go.

70
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,995
You remember me telling you about
those people from that newspaper?

71
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,199
They wanna ask you some
questions about your release.

72
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,108
They think it'll make a good story.

73
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,375
Will you talk to 'em? Get interviewed?

74
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,376
- Now, they're women.
- ("Guard snorts.)

75
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,480
I think it'd be good for you, too.
You're gonna be seeing all kinds of people

76
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,890
when you get on the outside.

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,292
This'll help, I believe.

78
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,097
Now, here's the thing.
He'll only talk to you,

79
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,299
but he doesn't want
you to ask him anything.

80
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,365
And you really shouldn't stare at him.

81
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,877
How am I going to conduct an interview
if I can't ask him any questions?

82
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,244
It's the best it's gonna get. I'm sorry.

83
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,378
Can I ask you a question? If he's so
troubled, why are you letting him out?

84
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,183
What if he does it again?
It happens all the time.

85
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,952
He's free, his time's
up. That's the rules.

86
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,620
He's been treated and reevaluated
and doesn't show any signs anymore.

87
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,426
- Signs?
- Homicidal signs.

88
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,698
Oh, Miss. I'm sorry, but you're
gonna have to step outside.

89
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,601
Why?

90
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,503
Please?

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,751
I gotta change the
light in here for Karl.

92
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,516
I hope you can still see to write.

93
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,861
I reckon what you is wanting to
know is what I'm a-doin' in here.

94
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:34,134
I reckon the reason I'm in here is
'cause I've killed somebody. Mm-hm.

95
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,835
But I reckon what you is a-wantin' to
know is how come me to kill somebody,

96
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,744
so I reckon I'll start
at the front and tell you.

97
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:48,710
I lived out the back of my mother
and father's place most of my life,

98
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,554
in a little old shed that
my daddy had built for me.

99
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,959
They didn't too much want me up there
in the house with the rest of 'em.

100
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,661
So mostly, I just sat around out there
in the shed, a-lookin' at the ground.

101
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,636
I didn't have no floor out there.

102
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,869
But I had me a hole
dug out to lay down in.

103
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,934
A quilt or two to
put down there. Mm-hm.

104
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:20,576
My father was a hardworking
man most of his life.

105
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,282
Not that I can say the same for myself.

106
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,723
I mostly just sat around
out there in the shed,

107
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,057
tinkered around with
a lawn mower or two.

108
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,792
Went to school off and
on from time to time.

109
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:39,099
But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me.

110
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,608
Made quite a bit of sport of
me. Made fun of me quite a bit.

111
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:49,342
So mostly, I just sat
around out there in the shed.

112
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,679
My daddy worked down
there at the saw mill,

113
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,658
down at the planer mill
for an old man named Dixon.

114
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,251
Old man Dixon was a very cruel fella.

115
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,765
Didn't treat his employees very well.
Didn't pay 'em too much of a wage.

116
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,665
Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.

117
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,501
Just barely enough to
get by on, I reckon.

118
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,234
But I reckon he got by all right.

119
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,612
They used to come out,
one or the other of 'em,

120
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,877
usually my mother,

121
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,214
feed me pretty regular.

122
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,279
Though I know he made
enough to where I could have

123
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,224
mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week.

124
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,859
But old man Dixon, he had a boy.

125
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,532
His name was Jesse Dixon.

126
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,335
Jesse was really more
cruel than his daddy was.

127
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:55,404
He used to make quite a bit of sport of me
when I was down there at the schoolhouse.

128
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:04,146
He used to take advantage of little
girls there in the neighborhood an' all.

129
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:11,092
He used to say that my mother
was a very pretty woman.

130
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:16,430
He said that quite a bit from time to time
when I'd be down there at the schoolhouse.

131
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,470
Well...

132
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,563
I reckon you want me to get on
with it and tell you what happened,

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,870
so I reckon I'll tell you.

134
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,244
I was sittin' out there in the shed one
evening, not doing too much of nothing,

135
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,976
just kinda staring at the wall,

136
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,987
waiting on my mother to come
out and give me my Bible lesson.

137
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,052
Well, I heard a commotion
up there in the house.

138
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,824
So I run up on the screened-in
porch to see what was a-goin' on.

139
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,764
I looked in the window there and I
seen my mother laying on the floor,

140
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,358
without any clothes on.

141
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,427
Mm-hm.

142
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,972
I seen Jesse Dixon
a-layin' on top of her.

143
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,138
He was having his way with her.

144
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,749
Well, I just seen red.

145
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,291
I picked up a Kaiser blade that was
sitting there by the screen door.

146
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,593
Some folks call it a sling
blade, I call it a Kaiser blade.

147
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,601
It's got a long wood handle,
kind of like an axe handle.

148
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,867
With a long blade on it shaped
kind of like a banana. Mm-hm.

149
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,637
Sharp on one edge and dull on the other.

150
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,704
It's what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot.

151
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,953
Well, I went in there in the house,

152
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:47,254
and I hit Jesse Dixon upside the head
with it, knocked him off my mother.

153
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,423
I reckon that didn't quite satisfy me.

154
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,029
So I hit him again with it in
the neck with the sharp edge

155
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,128
and just plumb near cut
his head off, killed him.

156
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,765
My mother, she jumped up from
there and started hollerin':

157
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,836
"What did you kill Jesse for?
What did you kill Jesse for?"

158
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,778
Well...

159
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,287
Come to find out I don't reckon my mother
minded what Jesse was a-doin' to her.

160
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,256
I reckon that made me madder
than what Jesse had made me.

161
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,657
So I taken the Kaiser blade,

162
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:26,255
some folks call it a sling
blade, I call it a Kaiser blade,

163
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,293
and I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

164
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,933
Killed her.

165
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,638
Some folks has asked me:

166
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,650
"If you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?"

167
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,050
Well, I reckon I would.

168
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:55,384
Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here,
and here I've been for a great long while.

169
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,895
I've learned to read some.

170
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,235
Took me four years to read the Bible.

171
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,363
I reckon I understand
a great deal of it.

172
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,636
Wasn't what I expected in some places.

173
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,211
I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while.

174
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,816
Now they've seen fit
to put me out of here.

175
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,218
They say they're setting me free today.

176
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,756
Anyhow, I reckon that's
all you'd need to know.

177
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,498
If you wanna hear about more details,
I reckon I can tell 'em to you.

178
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,196
I don't know whether or not that's
enough for your newspaper or not. Mm-hm.

179
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,401
("Marsha.) Will you ever
kill anybody again, Karl?

180
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,245
I don't reckon I've got
no reason to kill nobody.

181
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,260
- Where will he go?
- Anywhere he wants to.

182
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,326
I think he's going back to
Millsberg, where he's from.

183
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,736
- It's just about 20 miles from here.
- Will he be supervised?

184
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,105
As much as anybody else is, I guess.

185
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,339
Y'all have a real nice
rest of the day, now.

186
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,245
I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.

187
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,513
Melvin, could you walk
these girls out, please?

188
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,955
Thank you.

189
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,857
Thank you.

190
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:50,337
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to looking at purdy people. Mm-hm.

191
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,570
I guess you will.

192
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:58,882
I reckon I'm gonna have to get
used to them looking at me, too.

193
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,442
Better go get your things.

194
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,421
I ain't got nothing but them books.

195
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,652
Better go get 'em.

196
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,518
All right, then.

197
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,499
All right, then.

198
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,316
Can I help you, sir?

199
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,257
Can I help you, sir?

200
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,091
I was kindly wanting something
or other to eat. Mm-hm.

201
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,497
Well, what would you like?

202
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,067
You got any biscuits for sale in there?

203
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,835
No, this here's a Frostee
Cream. We don't serve biscuits.

204
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,107
- We got a lot of other stuff, though.
- What you got in there that's good to eat?

205
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,480
Well, we got Big Chief burgers,
Bongo burgers, Footlongs, Corny Dogs,

206
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,179
Frostee Shakes, Creamy Bars.

207
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,223
Did you want me to go
through the whole list?

208
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,815
Reckon what do you like to eat in there?

209
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,627
Well...

210
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,631
The French fries are pretty good.

211
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,499
- French-fried potatoes?
- Yep, French fries.

212
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,106
How much you want for 'em?

213
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,167
Well, they're 60 for the
medium and 75 for the large.

214
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,978
I reckon I'll have me
some of the big 'uns.

215
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,452
All right, then. One large French fries.

216
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,197
These darn things are
heavy. Hard to carry, too.

217
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,667
- What you got in there, wash?
- Yeah.

218
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,730
Ain't you got no mom
and daddy to tend to it?

219
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:26,540
I got a momma. She's at work
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

220
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,842
Daddy's dead. He got hit by a train.

221
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,452
How far are you going with
them sacks full of wash?

222
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,852
Half a mile, I think it is.

223
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,992
I can help you tote it
if I don't give out first.

224
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,722
OK, but you don't have to.

225
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,733
All right, then.

226
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,697
My name's Frank Wheatley.
What's your name?

227
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,071
Karl's my name.

228
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,134
- What's your last name?
- Childers.

229
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,675
What are all them books?

230
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,740
All different ones.

231
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,251
One of 'em's the Bible, one
of 'em's a book on Christmas,

232
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,754
one of 'em's on how to be a carpenter.

233
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:15,122
- Why do you carry them around with you?
- I ain't got no place to set 'em down.

234
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,320
Don't you live somewhere?

235
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,263
Did live up there in the state hospital.

236
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,428
- Why did you live there?
- I killed some folks quite a while back.

237
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,939
They said I wasn't right in the head, so
they put me there in the nervous hospital

238
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,236
instead of putting me in jail.

239
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,970
- They let you out?
- Yeah.

240
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,810
- How come?
- They told me I was well.

241
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,646
Had to turn me loose.

242
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,654
- Well, are you well?
- I reckon I feel all right.

243
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,256
This here's my house.

244
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,693
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.

245
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,961
We can just set these bags on the porch.

246
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,560
All right, then.

247
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,547
You like to play football?

248
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:22,491
I never was no account at it. I
never did get picked out for it.

249
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,961
Well, me and the Burnett
twins and some boys play

250
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,692
at the junior high
school field all the time.

251
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:32,203
If you wanna play, you can come on
over, 'cause we ain't no good either.

252
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,967
- Well, I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

253
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,492
Karl.

254
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,157
Hon, you can't just go in there.

255
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,298
Karl, what in the world
are you doing here?

256
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,963
I wanna come back and stay in here.

257
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,236
You can't do that. You're a free man.

258
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,141
They let you out so you
can do as you please.

259
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,873
I reckon I don't care nothing
about being a free man.

260
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,507
I don't know how to go about it. Mm-hm.

261
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,747
Well, you're gonna have to
learn. It'll take some time.

262
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,721
Don't you have anybody
down there to help you out?

263
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,054
No, sir.

264
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:06,325
Well, your daddy was living
down there the last time I heard.

265
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,391
I guess he wouldn't want to
help you out any, would he?

266
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,800
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

267
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,504
Don't you have anybody?

268
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,669
No, sir.

269
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,679
Never did know too much
of nobody down there.

270
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,238
Not to be helping me out no way. Mm-hm.

271
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,652
Look, Karl, the truth is, I don't
know where they expect you to go,

272
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,885
and I don't know what
they expect you to do.

273
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,659
If it was up to me, you could come
back here and stay if you wanted to.

274
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,529
I'm just trying to do my job.

275
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,762
You follow me?

276
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:54,037
Listen, Karl. I know an old boy who's
got a fix-it shop deal in Millsberg.

277
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,603
He used to go to church with me.

278
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,976
You're good working on
small engines and things.

279
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:05,318
If I was to put my neck
out for you with him,

280
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,326
do you think you could
work it if he'll hire you?

281
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:14,355
I'm pretty handy, I reckon, on
lawn mowers and whatnot. Mm-hm.

282
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,367
I know you are, I've seen it myself.

283
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,427
- Could you give it a try?
- I reckon.

284
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,907
Now, I... I can't promise
you that he'll hire you.

285
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,378
I'll have to tell him
about your history.

286
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,143
I never was no good
with history. Mm-hm.

287
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
No. I mean your past.

288
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,950
Why you were in here.

289
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,390
I'll take you down first
thing in the morning.

290
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,855
You don't have anywhere you
could stay tonight at all?

291
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,696
- No, sir.
- Well, you can't stay here.

292
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:56,298
It's against the rules. If something
was to happen, I'd be liable.

293
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,477
I reckon I can just walk
around till morning time.

294
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,343
And sit and read a
book somewheres. Mm-hm.

295
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,030
Karl, would you like a muffin?

296
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,093
No, thank you.

297
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:34,608
I understand Jerry's gonna take
you someplace else tomorrow.

298
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,240
I don't reckon I know
nobody named Jerry.

299
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,047
She's talking about me,
Karl. That's my first name.

300
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,750
He's carrying me to look for work down
in Millsberg, where I was born. Mm-hm.

301
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,218
Would you like some coffee?

302
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,460
Coffee makes me a mite
nervous when I drink it.

303
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,594
Daddy, can I be excused to go to bed?

304
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,104
Sure, honey. You sleep
with your momma tonight.

305
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,039
I'm gonna sleep with your brother,
so Karl can have your room.

306
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,633
Why?

307
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,103
'Cause he's company.

308
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,885
Well, Karl, looks like you got
plenty of blankets and things.

309
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,022
Bathroom's out there in the hall.

310
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,225
We'll leave at first light.

311
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,599
That's a... that's an old cowboy thing.

312
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,689
Jerry, why didn't you give him Bubba's room?
His sister's is a little girly, isn't it?

313
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,257
Yeah, I thought about that. I guess it
doesn't make any sense to move him now.

314
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,030
Daddy...

315
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:11,269
Don't you think one of us ought to stay up
all night and kind of guard or something?

316
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,776
Well, hell, no, son.
What's wrong with you?

317
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:18,680
- He's a nut, ain't he?
- "Isn't," Bubba. Don't say "ain't."

318
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,790
("Knocks at door)

319
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,162
- Karl, are you up?
- Yes, sir.

320
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,130
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl?

321
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,299
You been sitting there
like that all night?

322
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,467
Yes, sir.

323
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,637
Well, come on. We'd better hit the road.

324
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,079
All right, then.

325
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,395
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Bill.

326
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,166
Good to see you, man.
It's been a long time.

327
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,434
It's good to see you,
too. How's everybody doing?

328
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:54,569
Oh, pretty good. Kids are driving me crazy,
Phyllis is gonna put me in the poorhouse,

329
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,343
but I can't complain other than
that. Wouldn't do any good if I did.

330
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,782
- You know Scooter, Jerry?
- I don't believe I do.

331
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,980
- Good to meet you, Scooter.
- How about you?

332
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,546
Well, this is him, the one I was
telling you about on the phone.

333
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,593
Like I said, if you get nervous
about it, I'll understand.

334
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,188
I'm not gonna lie to you. He did get
into that trouble, but then he was young.

335
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,200
I remember that real well. He cut those
folks to pieces, his momma was one of 'em.

336
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,168
Yeah, and that old Dixon boy.

337
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:23,367
Oh, hell, I always wanted to kill
him myself. Asshole's what he was.

338
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:28,640
I remember that old boy, too. Kind of
retarded or something back in school.

339
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,774
Well, seems like he's pretty
well-adjusted these days.

340
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,751
He... I don't think
he'd ever hurt anybody.

341
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,845
He don't look much like he would.

342
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,447
You say he fixes small
engines like nobody's business?

343
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,187
He's a regular whiz. It's all
he's done since he was a kid.

344
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,493
- Are you scared of him, Scooter?
- No, I don't guess so.

345
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,624
- Can he talk?
- Oh, yeah.

346
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,431
Now, you say he can stay out the back?

347
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,564
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'm
gonna take it out of your pocket anyway.

348
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,133
Oh, he won't steal. He's a pretty
good old boy, really. Keeps to himself.

349
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,875
Well, I got a roomful of work for him to
do. I can't get Scooter to do any of it.

350
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,181
Karl, come over here. I want
you to meet your new boss.

351
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,278
This is Bill Cox.

352
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,917
He runs the place. Says that you
can work here and stay out back.

353
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,520
- It's good to know you, Karl.
- Thank you.

354
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,791
Karl, it's minimum wage, and
there ain't nothing back there

355
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,265
but an old army cot and a toilet.

356
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,895
Yeah, that'll be fine. Karl, I'm gonna
go out to the car and get your books.

357
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,962
All right, then.

358
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,271
Karl, they say you're a whiz on
fixing lawn mowers and things.

359
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,578
I've tinkered around on
'em a little bit. Mm-hm.

360
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,452
We order up from the Frostee
Cream at lunch, usually.

361
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,218
We can buy you lunch till
you get on your feet a little.

362
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,624
I like them French-fried
potatoes. Mm-hm.

363
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,587
Yeah? Me, too.

364
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,892
They make a good double meat burger.

365
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,282
All right, then. I'll see y'all later.

366
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,753
Karl, you done a good day's work
today. They was right about you.

367
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,280
Scooter, he gonna knock you out
of a job if you're not careful.

368
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,355
- All right, then, I'll see y'all tomorrow.
- Wait up. I'll leave with you and lock up.

369
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,127
Karl, there's a blanket
up in under that cot

370
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,192
and some soap in the
bathroom for cleaning up with.

371
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,263
Now, there's one more thing. The way we
lock these doors, you can't get out at night.

372
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,003
- You didn't wanna go anywhere, did you?
- I don't reckon.

373
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,878
If it works out, maybe we'll get you a key
so you can get out at night if you need to.

374
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,145
- I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

375
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:04,362
So then the old man says, "At my age,
I'd rather have the talking frog."

376
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,596
We'll see you, JW.

377
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,619
Scooter, did I tell you the one about
the two old boys pissing off the bridge?

378
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,891
- I don't remember.
- Well...

379
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,263
These two old boys hung their
peckers off the bridge to piss.

380
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,633
And one of the boys was from
California and one from Arkansas.

381
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,935
Old boy from California says,
"Boy, this water's cold."

382
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:47,637
Old boy from Arkansas said,
"Yeah, and it's deep, too."

383
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,738
Get it?

384
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,512
- That's a good 'un.
- That is a good one.

385
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,985
You know, I do believe you've
told me that one before.

386
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,079
I've heard that one a bunch.

387
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,287
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, that's a classic.

388
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,591
You know, Karl, I got to
thinking about it last night,

389
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,826
and it's just not Christian of
me not to let you have a key.

390
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,630
I mean, you've been in lockup so long,
you don't need me keeping you locked up.

391
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,863
You need to come and go as you please.

392
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,769
Here.

393
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,368
Take this key. It'll get you
in and out of here at night.

394
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,670
All right, then.

395
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:30,286
- Them French fries good? - Yeah,
they're good all right. Mm-hm.

396
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,548
You got any money?

397
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,825
Well, they give me some
when they turned me loose.

398
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:44,630
I spent up some of it a-ridin' on the bus
and eating French-fried potatoes. Mm-hm.

399
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,297
Well, I'm gonna pay you
today for this coming week

400
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,772
so you have some walking-around money.

401
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,241
When you get off this evening,
you need to go buy some toothpaste

402
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,041
and some cleaning up
supplies to have back there.

403
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,514
Get you some magazines
and some hard candy.

404
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,109
Something to keep you busy at night.

405
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,111
All right, then.

406
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,784
I'll let you off while
it's still daylight.

407
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,458
Hey, there. I thought I
heard somebody on the porch.

408
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,155
Wasn't your name Karl?

409
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,563
Yes, sir, it is. Your name's Frank.

410
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,633
Yeah. What are you doing by here?

411
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,036
You said for me to come by.

412
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,268
You wanna play ball with us?

413
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:02,574
I ain't no good at it. I just
come by to see you. Mm-hm.

414
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,810
Well, I was going to see my momma
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

415
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,078
She works two till eight.

416
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,814
All right, then.

417
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,380
You wanna go with me?
You can meet my momma.

418
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,060
I oughta not worry
your momma with company.

419
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,156
Aw, come on. You'll like
her. She's real nice.

420
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,033
And she'll give us anything we
want her to. Candy or something.

421
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,774
Well, I was kindly
needing to do some trading.

422
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,934
Reckon they sell toothpaste?

423
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,309
Yeah, they sell a
little bit of everything.

424
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,578
I won't tell her about you being
in the state hospital for killing.

425
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,176
Come on, let's go.

426
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,495
You're just gonna have to learn
to live without all that grease.

427
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,596
Shoot, not here in the South.

428
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,473
I like grease on everything. I
like fried chicken, fried okra.

429
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,136
- Biscuits and gravy.
- It'll kill you.

430
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,942
- Hey, Momma. Hey, Vaughan.
- Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

431
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,779
I bet I know. You want a whole
bunch of candy and a pop, right?

432
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,340
Yeah.

433
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,184
That stuffs gonna rot your teeth, don't
you know that? I got something even better.

434
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,816
I just put potted meat on special-four cans
for a dollar. They're not moving very well.

435
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:26,158
But I tell you what, I'll give a couple
of cans for free to the right kid.

436
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,221
I don't like potted meat.

437
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,200
Daddy used to say they was made
out of lips, peckers and intest...

438
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,259
Frank, don't talk that way.

439
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:38,104
Who's that strange-looking man
behind you? Did he follow you in here?

440
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,201
- Can I help you, sir?
- ("Frank) Oh, that's Karl.

441
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,371
I met him at the Laundromat.

442
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:48,441
Karl, this is Momma and
Vaughan. Vaughan's the manager.

443
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,115
He lets Momma off any time she feels
like it, 'cause they're best friends.

444
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,057
Nice to meet you, Karl.

445
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,459
Pleased to meet you.

446
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,799
Frank, why don't you come
back here with me for a minute?

447
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,032
I don't think I've seen you here before.

448
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:18,047
No, sir, I don't reckon you have. I don't
believe I've ever been in here before.

449
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,573
I don't believe this
store used to be here.

450
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,089
It's been here 17 years. You
live here before, or something?

451
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:30,253
I was born and raised here
up till I was 12 year old.

452
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,557
What brings you back?

453
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,723
What's that you say?

454
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,792
Why are you here now?

455
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,670
They turned me loose from
the state hospital. Mm-hm.

456
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,230
Is that right?

457
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,505
How long are you gonna be staying here?

458
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:52,106
Mr. Woolridge, he got me hired on
to work for Bill Cox's outfit. Mm-hm.

459
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,016
- You have family here?
- Not to speak of.

460
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:59,784
Hey, Karl. Guess what? Momma said you
can stay over with us out in the garage.

461
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,985
Our car won't fit in there
anyway. It's real neat.

462
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,552
Frank told me about your
situation. Frank loves company.

463
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,258
You know, especially after
his daddy passed an' all.

464
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,894
There ain't no sense in you
staying in that old greasy shop.

465
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,565
- He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
- He just got out of the state hospital.

466
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,632
- I know.
- Can we get some candy and pop?

467
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,406
- Sure thing. Go ahead.
- Come on.

468
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,109
You think it's safe to
let him around that guy?

469
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,516
Frank's just crazy about him.
He likes the way he talks.

470
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,953
He helped him carry
home the clean laundry.

471
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,549
He's been in the state hospital a long
time. There must be something wrong with him.

472
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,754
He's retarded's all. You know
he's always after a father figure.

473
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,059
Lord knows, Doyle ain't a
good one with his mean ass.

474
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,828
- What about me?
- I don't think he sees you as a "guy" guy.

475
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,234
Oh, Karl's a "guy" guy?

476
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,051
This is what I call my secret place,

477
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,617
'cause I come out here when
I feel like being by myself.

478
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,961
I used to come here with Karen Cross.
She's kind of like my girlfriend.

479
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,024
Or used to be.

480
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,969
We used to come out here
and hold hands and talk,

481
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,201
and read books to each
other with a flashlight.

482
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,039
She didn't want to have nothing
to do with me in front of people,

483
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,172
'cause I don't have any money.
Well, Momma and me, I mean.

484
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,274
See, her daddy's a
dentist, so they're rich.

485
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,544
Was your folks well off?

486
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:42,251
No, we didn't have too much. Just
barely enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

487
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,193
They still around, your folks?

488
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,460
My mother's dead. My daddy,
he's supposed to be around still.

489
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,797
But he don't wanna have
nothing to do with me.

490
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,962
How do you know?

491
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:59,533
Well, he never did want to. I figure
he probably ain't changed his mind much.

492
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,942
How did your momma die?

493
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,551
You don't need to hear things
like that. You're just a boy.

494
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,747
You need to think about good
thoughts while you're still a boy.

495
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:15,121
There's plenty of time
for all the other. Mm-hm.

496
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,786
I've had a lot of bad
thoughts since Daddy died.

497
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,195
Sometimes I wish I was still
real little and he was still here.

498
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,167
Momma's real good, but
I wish I had both of 'em.

499
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,829
We went to Memphis in the car one time.

500
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,499
It was raining so hard,
we couldn't see the road.

501
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,304
But I wasn't scared, 'cause
as long as Daddy was driving,

502
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,368
I thought nothing could happen to us.

503
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,540
That's the way I feel about Momma now.

504
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:45,348
Momma has a boyfriend now.
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

505
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,186
He works construction, so he
makes a pretty good living.

506
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,125
But he still don't help Momma
out with any money, though.

507
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,789
He ain't no good. He's mean to her.

508
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,027
He don't like me at all. Momma
says it's 'cause he's jealous,

509
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,127
'cause I belong to my
daddy instead of him.

510
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:05,039
He spends the night over at our house
sometimes, and he's got his own house.

511
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,408
Somebody told me it's where
he can have more girlfriends.

512
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,640
I like it on the nights
he ain't at our house.

513
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,046
I ain't so nervous then.

514
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,316
How come her to still be girlfriend
an' all with him if he mean to her?

515
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,188
She says it's for the
times when he's good to her.

516
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,855
She's lonely since Daddy died.
Sometimes she says she don't know why.

517
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,558
He threatened to kill
her if she ever left him.

518
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:34,263
My daddy would kill him if he was still
here and somebody was mean to Momma.

519
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,399
Vaughan, he's real good to
Momma. Vaughan that you met.

520
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,568
But he's not able to
do anything to Doyle.

521
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,875
He's funny, you know. Not
funny ha-ha, funny queer.

522
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,211
He likes to go with
men instead of women.

523
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,911
That makes him not be
able to fight too good.

524
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,079
He sure is nice, though.

525
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:55,387
He's from St. Louis. People who are
queer get along better in a big town.

526
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,950
I wish he liked to go with women.

527
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,089
I'd rather him be Momma's
boyfriend than Doyle.

528
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,894
Karl, you know when I told
you Daddy got hit by a train?

529
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,097
Yes, I recollect that.

530
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:15,568
It ain't the truth. He shot
himself with a shotgun on purpose.

531
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,376
How come he would do that, reckon?

532
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,142
'Cause he didn't have enough money to
take care of us the way he wanted to.

533
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,783
That's what the letter said. He got laid
off at work and started working odd jobs.

534
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,987
I thought he took care of us just fine.

535
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,698
Karl, did you really kill somebody?

536
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,832
- Yes, sir, I did.
- Who did you kill?

537
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,104
- Two people.
- Were they bad people?

538
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,168
I thought they was.

539
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,173
Well, maybe they needed it.

540
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,745
Well, I growed up and learned that
you ain't supposed to kill nobody.

541
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,222
It's all right if you're
looking out for yourself.

542
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:05,284
If it's self-defense.
Was it self-defense?

543
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,960
My daddy was good. I think
too many good people die.

544
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,368
That's what I think.

545
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,386
Karl, are you sure you wanna
go stay with these folks?

546
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,264
You're welcome to keep on staying
here. It's working out real good.

547
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,495
That boy wants me to.

548
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,202
All right, then. I'll
see you bright and early.

549
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,265
How are you coming along
with that garden tiller?

550
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,140
I fixed it. It's working
pretty good now. Mm-hm.

551
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,774
You done fixed it? Well, I'll be damned.
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.

552
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,650
Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless
as one poor son of a bitch can be.

553
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,315
You done fixed it. Well,
I'll just be damned.

554
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,418
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, then.

555
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,429
I don't guess I give a shit, 'cause,
I mean, I ain't here that much anyway.

556
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,272
If you want a retard living out in the
garage, I guess that's your business.

557
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,573
Of course, I do got some tools
out there and a set of sockets

558
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,773
I'd rather not have stole. I
could take those home with me.

559
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,942
He's real honest. He
wouldn't steal nothing.

560
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,713
Now, Frankie, I wasn't
talking to you, was I?

561
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,449
- Huh?
- No, sir.

562
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,321
"No, sir" is right. I
was talking to your momma.

563
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:48,388
This is her decision, not yours. If I let
it go on, it's 'cause she asked me, not you.

564
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:54,128
Hey, is this the kind of retard that drools
and rubs shit in his hair and all that?

565
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,401
'Cause I'm gonna have a hard time
eating around that kind of thing, now.

566
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,874
Just like I am about antique
furniture and midgets.

567
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,138
You know that. I can't so much
as drink a damn glass of water

568
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,612
around a midget or a
piece of antique furniture.

569
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,911
Doyle, you're awful. You
shouldn't be that way.

570
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,578
I ain't saying it's right. I'm just
telling you it's the damn truth.

571
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,554
Now, he'll make me sick. I know it.

572
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,889
- What was he in the nut house for?
- He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

573
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,090
Mm-mm. No, no. He had to go
nuts and did something, now.

574
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,497
Come on. There's a lot of retards running
around ain't locked up in the nut house.

575
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,002
Think about it, Linda.

576
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,767
- You know what he done, Frank?
- I ain't sure.

577
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,433
Yeah, well, you might
oughta want to find out.

578
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,376
He might have hacked his family to
pieces with a hatchet or something.

579
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,436
Yeah, that's right,
Frank. You better ask him.

580
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,745
I mean, don't hurt his feelings or
anything, but it'd be good to know.

581
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,344
I'm sure it's nothing.
He seems real sweet.

582
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,288
You're all hung up on people
being sweet, aren't you?

583
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:51,384
He's sweet, everybody's sweet. Speaking
of sweet, where's your girlfriend?

584
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,088
I thought you said he's
coming over here for something.

585
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,530
He'll be here in a little while.
He's taking me to get an ice cream.

586
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,228
Ain't that sweet. What am
I gonna do about supper,

587
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,066
while you're out running
around with that fag?

588
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,971
You're not crippled. Get
in there and make something.

589
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,566
Talking back and everything, aren't you?

590
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,736
That kind of makes me horny, Linda.

591
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,680
Frank, why don't you go off and play in
your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty?

592
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,014
- I don't wanna go play in my room.
- He don't wanna play in his room, baby.

593
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,919
Just let him sit here.
Let's all just be a family.

594
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:24,689
Till your mentally retarded friend
and your homosexual friend get here.

595
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,058
("Footsteps.)

596
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,904
("Vaughan.) Karl?

597
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,965
Yes, sir.

598
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,836
So you're really going to stay here?

599
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,144
That boy, he wants me to.

600
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,652
Have you knocked on the door yet?

601
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,817
- No, sir, I ain't.
- How long have you been standing here?

602
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,485
Quite a spell, I reckon.

603
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,553
Listen, Karl. Before you get
very used to staying here,

604
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,964
I think you and I need to talk about
a few things. Can I take you to lunch?

605
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,094
I done ate just a
little bit ago. Mm-hm.

606
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,833
No, I mean... I mean
tomorrow, or the next day.

607
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:16,172
I reckon I could use a little
something or other to eat at noon time.

608
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,579
Bill Cox, he generally
gets me a box lunch.

609
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:23,380
But I reckon he can lay off
of doing it tomorrow. Mm-hm.

610
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:28,356
OK. Well, then, I'll come by Mr. Cox's
and pick you up around noon, all right?

611
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,416
All right, then.

612
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,424
There's your girlfriend.

613
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,762
Hey, y'all come on in.

614
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,373
Come on. Have a seat in here.

615
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,272
- Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
- Oh, tolerable, I reckon.

616
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,782
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.

617
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,978
Frank, why don't you and Karl go on out
in the garage and fix him up a place?

618
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,954
Play a game or something.
Vaughan, you ready to go?

619
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:02,014
- Sure, I guess.
- Hey, honey, don't rush everybody off yet.

620
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,083
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?

621
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,029
Aw, I don't want to. Me and
Karl's got things we need to do.

622
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,396
Hey, Vaughan. You know what I heard?

623
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,732
I heard you been putting it on old Albert
Sellers, works over at the funeral home.

624
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,934
- I know Albert. We're friends.
- No, I heard you's more than friends.

625
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:21,569
Yeah, I heard Dick Rivers come in
and caught the two of you all bowed up

626
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,977
and going at it right in the same
room with poor old Miss Olgetree,

627
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,242
and her dead as a doornail,
laid out on a gurney.

628
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,615
- That's ridiculous. That is just a total lie.
- Let's go, Vaughan.

629
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,177
Frank, we'll be back in a little
while. I'll bring you back something.

630
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,917
And your food's in
the oven, warming over.

631
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,118
See? You fixed him
something, didn't you?

632
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,220
Hey, Vaughan. I was
just going on with you.

633
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:46,293
- Just joking around, you know, buddy.
- I know that. You're a real card, all right.

634
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:52,506
So, Karl, come over here
and sit down. Talk to me.

635
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,709
Come on, Karl, let's go to the garage.

636
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,381
Goddamnit, I wanna talk to him.

637
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,447
You sit down, Karl.

638
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,721
So what's in your bag?

639
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,601
Mm... This and that.

640
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,037
Toothpaste and whatnot. Mm-hm.

641
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,709
What's all them books?

642
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:32,578
Different ones. One of
'em's the Bible. Mm-hm.

643
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,982
You believe in the Bible, do you, Karl?

644
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,680
Yes, sir, a good deal of it.

645
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,053
I can't understand all of it.

646
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,250
Yeah, well, I can't
understand none of it.

647
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:49,732
This one begat that one, and that one
begat this one, and begat, and begat,

648
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,098
and lo and behold, someone says
some shit to someone or another.

649
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,661
- Just how retarded are you?
- Stop it, Doyle.

650
00:52:55,705 --> 00:53:00,335
Frankie, you be quiet. We're
talking. The adults are talking.

651
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:08,378
So was you in lockup for cutting
someone up with a hatchet or something?

652
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,387
I ain't never used no hatchet
that I remember. Mm-hm.

653
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:17,222
So you're just crazy in a
retard kind of way, then, huh?

654
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,457
It wouldn't matter to me if
you did do violence on somebody.

655
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,192
I ain't scared of shit.

656
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,394
You think I'm scared
for you to stay here?

657
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:30,405
You're just a humped-over
retard, it seems to me.

658
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:39,779
I'm just kidding you. Welcome
to our humble home, buddy.

659
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,114
See, Frank here needs all
the friends he can get.

660
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,814
Frank's a weak little kid.

661
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,187
His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.

662
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,419
Stop, Doyle. Don't talk about my daddy.

663
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,791
("Mocking.) "Don't talk about my daddy."

664
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,765
Go on, get outta here. Go on
out to the garage, leave me be.

665
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,699
Go on.

666
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,760
Come on, Karl.

667
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,540
Frankie?

668
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:18,179
Don't say nothing about our
little spat to your momma, now.

669
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,520
I don't want her
worrying about your ass.

670
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,995
I'd like to kill that son
of a bitch. I hate him.

671
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,601
You oughta not talk
thataway. You're just a boy.

672
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,796
Well, I hate him.

673
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,533
He oughta not talk
thataway to you neither.

674
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,941
He ain't no account, if he's
mean to you and your momma.

675
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,378
Your momma and that fella that's carrying
me to get something or other to eat

676
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,145
going to be back directly.

677
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,313
Will you be here with
us for a long time?

678
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,755
I reckon, if you want me to.

679
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:01,629
I got some of that potted meat and soda
crackers left over, if you want some.

680
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:06,601
I don't see how you can eat all that
stuff, with them insides it's made out of.

681
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,901
Well, I reckon it
tastes pretty good to me.

682
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,671
I like the way you talk.

683
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,075
Well, I like the way you talk.

684
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,379
You think it's really got
peckers in there, cut up?

685
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:26,889
Hey, you know better than that.
You oughta not say that word.

686
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,793
- Well, it smells kinda funny.
- It's a little loud.

687
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:37,857
Looky right there. I believe you're
right. I believe I see one right in there.

688
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,720
Mister, reckon you can hand me
some of that mustard over there?

689
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,956
Thank you.

690
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,029
OK, Karl, the reason
that I brought you here

691
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:20,236
is to talk to you about
something that's on my mind.

692
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,940
I'm just... I'm just gonna
put it right out on the table.

693
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,346
Where do I start? Um...

694
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,783
Linda and Frank are
very important to me.

695
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,983
They're like family.

696
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,791
My own family was never like a
family. They're horrible people.

697
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,593
As a matter of fact,

698
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:47,466
for years I prayed every
night that my father would die,

699
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,335
and finally I realized
through a lot of therapy

700
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,901
that I was wasting my
energy on hating him.

701
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,377
So...

702
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,641
now I just don't care.

703
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:04,415
But, you see, you and I are a lot
alike, as strange as that may seem.

704
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:09,720
I don't... I don't mean physically,
or even mentally, really,

705
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,954
but, well, emotionally.

706
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:16,863
Actually, the hand that
we've been dealt in life.

707
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:22,834
We're different. People see
us as being different, anyway.

708
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:28,003
You're... well, you've got
your affliction or whatever,

709
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,510
and I...

710
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,412
well, mine's not as easy to see.

711
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,711
I'm just going to say it.

712
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,776
I'm gay.

713
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,087
Does that surprise you?

714
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,152
That I'm gay?

715
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,790
You know what gay is, don't you?

716
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,927
I don't reckon.

717
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,001
Homosexual.

718
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,596
I like men.

719
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,335
Sexually.

720
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,177
Not funny ha-ha,
funny queer. Mm-hm.

721
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,510
Well, that's a very
offensive way to put it.

722
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:14,614
You shouldn't say that, Karl.
You were taught that, weren't you?

723
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,784
I've heard it said thataway, yes, sir.

724
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:22,389
Anyway, it's hard to live gay -
that's the right way to say it -

725
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,456
in a small town like this.

726
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,298
I've wanted to leave many times, but...

727
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:35,906
because I love Linda, Frank,
and a certain other person,

728
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,207
I...

729
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,341
They've kept me from leaving.
Look, anyway, I'm rambling. The...

730
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,545
If you're going to live
in the Wheatley garage,

731
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,112
you... you need to know
it's not going to be easy.

732
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,818
Doyle is a monster.

733
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,691
Not just a closed-minded
redneck, but a monster.

734
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,458
A dangerous person.

735
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:01,232
I've told Linda that one day that
man is going to hurt her and that boy.

736
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,602
Maybe even kill them.

737
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,234
I see it in his eyes. I'm very
in tune, maybe even psychic.

738
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,541
But Doyle is going to
make your life hell.

739
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,883
There's... there's one more thing.

740
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:23,688
It's none of my business why
you were in the state hospital.

741
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,854
Everybody has something in their past.

742
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,864
Maybe...

743
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,526
you tried suicide,

744
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,570
maybe you did something... terrible.

745
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,565
But what I see before me

746
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:43,738
is a gentle, simple man.

747
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,711
All I want you to promise me...

748
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,713
is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda. You know.

749
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:59,023
You would never hurt either one of
them under any circumstances, would you?

750
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,123
I wouldn't never hurt them.

751
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:10,199
That's what I thought. OK. Look, I'm sorry
if... if I've offended you in any way.

752
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,538
You seem like a thinker, you know.

753
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,704
You seem to always be deep in thought.

754
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,980
Tell me something. What
are you thinking right now?

755
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:32,589
I was thinking I might wanna take me
some of these potatoes home with me.

756
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,892
Oh. How about before that?

757
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,166
Let me think.

758
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,402
Before that I was thinking

759
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:54,075
I could use me another six or eight cans
of that potted meat, if you got any extra.

760
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,026
("Doyle.) Frankie, get some more salad.

761
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,431
Hold your plate up for me, Frankie.

762
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:15,397
I'm just gonna reach. So, how
come Karl won't eat here with us?

763
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,929
I don't know. He said
he'd eat out there.

764
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,067
I wouldn't let it get to you.
Put some of this dressing on it.

765
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,634
- No, no.
- Yes.

766
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,704
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

767
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,319
Who the hell could eat with him making
all that goddamn racket in his throat?

768
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,719
- It's raunchy.
- He does make some funny noises.

769
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,690
Well, I like the way he talks.

770
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,626
It sounds like a racecar motor
idling. It makes me not be nervous.

771
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,721
Well, I'm glad of it, honey.

772
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,063
What have you got to be nervous
about? You're a damn kid.

773
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,466
You ain't got no bills to pay.

774
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,869
You got no business to run. You
don't even have to have a job.

775
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,136
You got no old lady eating
on your ass all the time.

776
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,508
Well, I don't know. I just stay nervous.

777
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:03,013
- Could I have some of that ham?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

778
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,549
Thanks.

779
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,033
You know what, by God?

780
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,170
What?

781
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,113
I know what I'd do tonight.

782
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,515
- Oh, please, Doyle,
don't. - Mm-hm. Yeah.

783
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,147
I'm gonna call up Morris and have him
get the band together. We'll have a party.

784
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,282
Party our asses off.

785
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,424
I'd love to show them that damn
Karl. They'd get a kick out of him.

786
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,122
- You know they would.
- Please, now, not tonight.

787
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:51,565
I'm just not up for it. They always stay
till morning. I'm just give out, Doyle.

788
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,296
You don't gotta do nothing, Linda.
Just put some chips in a bowl

789
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,964
and run ice out to us when we look low.

790
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,373
Last time you got mad and run Morris and
them off, told them to stay away from here.

791
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,809
That ain't none of your business, Frank.

792
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,747
Besides, that's the way
friends do one another.

793
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,650
Fuck it, I'm calling 'em up.

794
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,321
Linda, go out there in the
garage and get my guitar.

795
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,761
- It's out there with that loony tune.
- Now?

796
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,165
Yeah, now. I'm calling 'em up.

797
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,758
Hey, Morris.

798
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,464
What you doing, boy?

799
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,064
Where's Randy and them?

800
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,100
Yeah, now, please.
Frankie, go help your mom.

801
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,147
- When are we gonna eat?
- Hang on.

802
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,205
You eat when you come
back. Go get my guitar.

803
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,308
Come on, sugar.

804
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,376
No, I wanna get together.

805
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,387
Yeah.

806
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,822
Well, call him.

807
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,187
("Linda.) Knock, knock.

808
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,257
Karl, now, listen.

809
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,733
There's gonna be a party
tonight over here at the house.

810
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,738
Doyle's invited his music-playing buddies
over to get liquored up, pick fights

811
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,298
and make a bunch of
racket out on the patio.

812
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:11,440
It's on. We're gonna rock.

813
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,244
Hey, Linda, call up Vaughan
and get him over here.

814
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,979
I want him to be here. I
wanna show him a good time.

815
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,284
No, Doyle. Vaughan don't
wanna come to a party with you.

816
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:25,760
Too late, Linda. I already called him.
He's coming, or I'm gonna go get him.

817
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,125
Hey, Frankie.

818
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:31,428
Take that tub, and you and Karl come
out here and help me ice down some beer.

819
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,436
Karl, help him get that
tub. Come on, Frankie.

820
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:37,665
Come on, Frankie.

821
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,012
("Doyle.) Go ahead and
kick her off. Johnson!

822
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,176
Here we go. One, two,

823
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,879
one, two, three, four.

824
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,944
("Shambolic playing.)

825
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,856
You gotta play through it.

826
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,694
When we're on a gig, you gotta
play through it. You gotta...

827
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,291
- No, you play through it on a gig.
- Did you like that, Vaughan?

828
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:43,498
Sure. It sounds like a number
one hit tune, all right.

829
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:47,030
How about you, Karl?
Karl, did you like that?

830
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,567
- I reckon.
- ("Man.) I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!

831
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,740
- I can't hear myself think with that racket.
- Hey!

832
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,808
- ("Man.) Well, it's nighttime. You let...
- Hey!

833
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:00,287
- ("Man.) I'm calling the police!
- I told you three times already.

834
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,325
The law's on my side.

835
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:07,351
I play cards with JD
Shelnut, chief of police,

836
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,729
so kiss my ass, you old bastard!

837
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,298
Hey, Linda.

838
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,634
You and Frank clean this mess up for us,
and put the tarp over these instruments.

839
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,073
Me and the boys are gonna go down to the
county line. We're out of liquor and beer.

840
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,236
Hey, Karl, come along
with us. Vaughan, come on.

841
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,713
Oh, no, I don't think so. It's
late. I-I have to work tomorrow.

842
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,683
Don't be a pussy, Vaughan.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

843
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,413
- Come on.
- ("Linda.) He don't want to, Doyle.

844
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:35,856
Don't go, Vaughan, if you don't want
to. You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.

845
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:40,055
Uh-uh. I ain't gonna wreck, honey.
Come on. I'll be good, I promise.

846
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,461
I love you, sweetie.

847
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,266
Come on, Karl, go with us.

848
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,963
I'm just trying to make these two
feel like they're part of it, baby.

849
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,268
Come on, Vaughan. This'll be fun.

850
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,740
Hey, Karl, let's go. Come on.

851
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:06,512
- You better lay off that tambourine.
- Hey, man, I ain't doing nothing wrong.

852
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,524
Hey!

853
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,294
Ain't anybody gonna come and get me?

854
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,902
Not that you two afflicted son of a
bitches would know anything about this,

855
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:26,100
but you're sitting in a
crew-cab dually pickup.

856
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,009
In some circles, this is considered
a piece of automotive art.

857
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,709
Are you sure you can drive?
You've really had a lot of alcohol.

858
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,948
When you've been drinking as long as
me, Vaughan, you build up a tolerance.

859
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,149
Hide that between your
legs for me, will you?

860
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,045
- Hey, Freddy. How about you?
- How about you, Doyle?

861
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,607
How you doing, boy? Hey.

862
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,347
I saw your picture in the paper,
catching that big ass bass.

863
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,753
Yeah, she was a big 'un.

864
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,658
Boys.

865
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,717
Hello, Freddy.

866
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,126
Freddy.

867
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,826
You ain't drunk driving, are you, Doyle?

868
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,893
- Yeah, pretty much.
- ("Freddy.) I figured.

869
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,771
You be careful with that cripple in the
back, now. You're liable to throw him out.

870
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,936
- Looks like you got
a wagonful. - Uh-huh.

871
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:40,004
We ran out of something to drink. I'm
headed over to the county line to get some.

872
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,482
You wanna race?

873
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,884
You know better than
that, Doyle. We're on duty.

874
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,857
But I'll catch you
next week with that 327.

875
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,792
Yeah, you'll try.

876
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,893
What exactly are you talking
about? I don't understand.

877
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,497
("Man.) Exactly the point,
my young levelheaded friend.

878
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:08,031
- I don't get it.
- Well, I rest my case.

879
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,273
Morris is real smart with
philosophies and things.

880
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,475
That's why him and me is the
songwriting team of our group.

881
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,509
See, I come up with the good
tunes, or melodies as we call 'em,

882
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,112
and, um, Morris is the lyrics.

883
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,954
Not unlike Gary Brooker
of the Procol Harum.

884
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,960
We don't ever play any
songs that y'all wrote.

885
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,963
I ain't heard one of
'em. Y'all just talk.

886
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:32,432
We don't even play any songs
with words at all that I remember.

887
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,733
We ain't got no fucking microphone.
We ain't got no speaker set up.

888
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,535
We wrote one last night
outside the minimart,

889
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,977
and, um, Morris called it
"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."

890
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:49,541
And then, like in country songs,
you know, in parenthesis it says:

891
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,781
"There's usually someone in the trunk."

892
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,949
And, um, I came up with
a tune, just a-hummin'.

893
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,188
See, you don't wanna
question a genius, Vaughan.

894
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,923
Morris here, he's a modern-day poet,

895
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,227
kinda like in the olden times.

896
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,734
Yeah. I got a new tune.

897
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:11,671
This composition's entitled "The
Thrill." Goes something like this:

898
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,470
"I stand on the hill

899
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,534
"Not for a thrill

900
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,809
"But for a breath of a fresh kill

901
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,045
"Never mind the man who contemplates

902
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,110
"Doing away with license plates

903
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,952
"He stands alone anyhow

904
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,152
"Baking the cookies of discontent

905
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,425
"By the heat of the Laundromat vent

906
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,128
"Leaving his soul..."

907
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,536
Then, like in poetry, I go
dot-dot-dot, you know, kinda off-center,

908
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,972
then I drop down, and then I go:

909
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,943
"Leaving his soul parting the waters

910
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,413
"Of the medulla oblongata of..."

911
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,279
("silly noise.)

912
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,013
"...mankind"

913
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:03,423
A damn good song, weren't it,
Doyle? You like that song? All right.

914
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,392
I don't think that's right.

915
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:10,455
I believe the dot-dot-dot come
between "medulla" and "oblongata."

916
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:18,539
- Well, it did.
- The dots are where I say they are.

917
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,940
Melody and tune
- that's your trade, Terence.

918
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,411
You're a tunesmith.

919
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,573
I don't understand the
meaning of the words.

920
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,709
If y'all don't shut up,
I'm gonna go outta my mind.

921
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,586
Besides, Karl here's liable to bust
a spring. He's already off balance.

922
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,820
That wasn't the way you made it up
before, Morris. That's all I know.

923
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:42,262
We don't need no fancy words. I mean,
we need to practice. We need to rehearse.

924
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:46,131
I'll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

925
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,364
We don't need this messing around,
first on one patio and then another.

926
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,498
- That's ridiculous.
- Amen, Johnson.

927
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,607
We don't got no goddamn band!

928
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,911
We don't need to
fucking practice, Randy!

929
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,513
We don't need a
shit-ass manager neither.

930
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,223
You motherfuckers! Y'all
just a bunch of losers!

931
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:13,955
I'm the only sane son of a bitch here!
Just get the fuck outta my house now!

932
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,463
It's not your house,
Doyle, it's Linda's.

933
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,023
I'll whip the dog shit
outta you, Vaughan.

934
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,229
I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again.

935
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:27,708
Now, all of you, get the fuck out
now, before I get too mad to turn back.

936
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,176
What about our instruments?

937
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:35,583
Come here, you little prick.
Come here, you fucking prick!

938
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,749
Get out! All of y'all!

939
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,256
Now, get the fuck out!

940
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,724
Come on, you motherfuckers!

941
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,995
Get the fuck out!

942
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,962
Randy, you tooting son of a bitch!

943
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,602
Go fucking practice, Randy!

944
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,177
Come on, Morris, you fucking genius, get
the fuck up and get the fuck outta here,

945
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,338
goddamnit!

946
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:11,418
This ain't right, Doyle. There
is something wrong with you.

947
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:16,117
- Get the fuck out!
- Nobody wants to take this shit, man.

948
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,598
Dots look good on paper.

949
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:30,229
You don't sing 'em anyway. You're
just showing your true Aries color now.

950
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:34,435
Stay outta my goddamn
face, you fucking buzzard.

951
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:40,945
Hey!

952
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,951
I said, get outta my house!

953
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:48,388
That goes for cocksuckers and retards.
Now, get up off your asses and go.

954
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,482
- Come on!
- This is not your house, Doyle.

955
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,687
This is my house, and I'll
say who stays and who goes.

956
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,755
You got a house. Why don't you go get
one of your girlfriends and go home to it?

957
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,098
You know better than to talk to me
like that when I'm hurting, Linda.

958
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,539
- Don't make me knock the piss outta you.
- Don't you touch her.

959
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,041
That's funny, Vaughan.

960
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,807
Linda, go to bed, and take
little snot nose here with you.

961
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,178
You're not staying here tonight.

962
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:18,276
Go get sober before you come back.
I'm tired of my child seeing this.

963
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:23,381
Now, you get your ass straight, or I'll
lock your ass outta my life for good.

964
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,520
If you even think about
leaving me, Linda, I told you,

965
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:31,362
- I'm gonna kill you deader than a doornail.
- That might be better than this.

966
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,957
All right, I'm a witness.
I heard you threaten her.

967
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,368
- Hey! You get the fuck out now!
- Leave!

968
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,003
- Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
- Leave!

969
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,972
- Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
- Leave!

970
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,945
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Leave!

971
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:47,675
Don't you tell me what to do, Lin...

972
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,240
- Don't do that, Linda.
- I'm calling the police!

973
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:55,552
- Goddamn you, you little prick!
- ("Shouts incoherently.)

974
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,286
Go home!

975
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,089
Jesus!

976
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,756
Hey! Goddamn you, Frankie.

977
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,425
- Get away from us!
- Goddamnit!

978
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,267
God!

979
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,670
Get away from us!

980
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,998
All right.

981
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,669
OK.

982
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,577
I'm gonna leave now. Fuck me!

983
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,649
Fuck me!

984
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,380
I'm gonna go home and sober up.

985
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,019
Go on, then.

986
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:34,222
Everything's bothering
me. I'm hurting, Linda.

987
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,489
- I love you.
- Well, I hate you!

988
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,557
I hate you, you little prick!

989
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,626
No, I don't. No, I don't.

990
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,898
I love your momma.

991
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,537
I just...

992
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,406
I can't explain what goes on.

993
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:52,777
You bunch of freaks,
I hope you have fun.

994
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,343
I'll call you tomorrow.

995
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,580
I'm sorry, honey.

996
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,456
I said I'm sorry, Linda.

997
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,354
OK.

998
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,331
All right, you can kiss my ass.

999
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,891
And if you ever hit me
again, you little bastard,

1000
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,872
I swear to God I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

1001
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,101
You hear me?

1002
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,520
- You all right, Momma?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1003
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,863
Let's just try and forget about tonight.

1004
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,902
We don't need to think about
bad thoughts, do we, Momma?

1005
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,998
No, honey, we don't.

1006
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,669
I'll make some coffee,
start cleaning up this mess.

1007
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,577
Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

1008
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:03,084
Coffee kinda makes me nervous
when I drink it. Mm-hm.

1009
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:22,995
What are you doing up again, Frank?
You need to get a little sleep.

1010
01:17:23,066 --> 01:17:25,227
Did Vaughan go home?

1011
01:17:25,302 --> 01:17:27,702
Yes. He has to go to
work in a little while.

1012
01:17:27,771 --> 01:17:29,932
I do, too.

1013
01:17:31,975 --> 01:17:33,966
Did Karl go to bed?

1014
01:17:34,044 --> 01:17:36,740
I guess. He went to the garage.

1015
01:17:37,714 --> 01:17:41,241
Poor thing. He's probably
never seen such a crazy mess.

1016
01:17:41,318 --> 01:17:45,220
Probably wants to go back
and live in Mr. Cox's shop.

1017
01:17:45,288 --> 01:17:46,983
I bet he don't.

1018
01:17:47,057 --> 01:17:49,025
He likes me.

1019
01:17:49,092 --> 01:17:51,253
I know he does.

1020
01:17:52,062 --> 01:17:53,393
Momma...

1021
01:17:53,463 --> 01:17:55,488
Hm?

1022
01:17:55,565 --> 01:17:58,762
Is everything gonna
be all right someday?

1023
01:17:58,835 --> 01:18:02,134
I stay nervous all the time, just about.

1024
01:18:04,441 --> 01:18:08,707
Yeah, honey. Someday
everything's gonna be all right.

1025
01:18:08,779 --> 01:18:11,907
Doyle wouldn't really
kill you, would he?

1026
01:18:12,883 --> 01:18:15,943
I promise, we're gonna
get away from him.

1027
01:18:16,019 --> 01:18:18,146
The time has to be right, that's all.

1028
01:18:18,221 --> 01:18:22,851
I'd rather him get tired of me and
leave me, then he wouldn't wanna hurt me.

1029
01:18:22,926 --> 01:18:25,258
He wouldn't care then.

1030
01:18:26,530 --> 01:18:29,465
We'll be fine, I promise.

1031
01:18:29,533 --> 01:18:33,799
- You go to bed now. I love you.
- I love you too, Mom.

1032
01:18:33,870 --> 01:18:36,031
Go on.

1033
01:18:55,258 --> 01:18:57,419
You scared me.

1034
01:18:58,495 --> 01:19:00,759
- I didn't aim to.
- You wanna sit down?

1035
01:19:00,831 --> 01:19:03,197
Do you need something?

1036
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,427
No, ma'am.

1037
01:19:20,817 --> 01:19:22,978
There's these two fellas.

1038
01:19:23,053 --> 01:19:27,956
They're standing on a bridge
and going to the bathroom.

1039
01:19:28,024 --> 01:19:32,188
One fella says that the water's cold.

1040
01:19:32,262 --> 01:19:35,163
Other fella said the water's deep.

1041
01:19:38,602 --> 01:19:42,197
I believe one fella come from Arkansas.

1042
01:19:42,272 --> 01:19:44,433
Get it?

1043
01:19:45,876 --> 01:19:48,037
I'll be dog.

1044
01:20:00,290 --> 01:20:03,817
Reckon you could make me some biscuits?

1045
01:20:03,894 --> 01:20:06,658
Right now?

1046
01:20:06,730 --> 01:20:11,497
Whenever you take a notion to.
I don't aim to put you out none.

1047
01:20:11,568 --> 01:20:14,332
Well, it is nearly
breakfast time anyway.

1048
01:20:14,404 --> 01:20:17,999
I can't go to sleep. I have
to be at work in three hours.

1049
01:20:18,074 --> 01:20:20,565
You know how it is when you
only sleep an hour or two,

1050
01:20:20,644 --> 01:20:23,545
you feel worse than if
you hadn't slept at all?

1051
01:20:23,613 --> 01:20:25,945
Yes, ma'am, I do.

1052
01:20:27,784 --> 01:20:31,447
Well, sit down. I'll make
you some biscuits and gravy.

1053
01:20:31,521 --> 01:20:34,149
Mustard's good on 'em to me.

1054
01:20:34,224 --> 01:20:35,452
OK.

1055
01:20:35,525 --> 01:20:38,221
- Thank you.
- Oh, it's all right.

1056
01:20:41,198 --> 01:20:45,567
You know, I was thinking. There's
this girl that works with me.

1057
01:20:45,635 --> 01:20:48,570
She's real heavy, but
she's cute in the face.

1058
01:20:48,638 --> 01:20:51,835
Well, you know, she's slow.

1059
01:20:53,443 --> 01:20:55,775
She's a little bit... I think...

1060
01:20:55,846 --> 01:20:58,110
She's not retarded, just...

1061
01:20:58,348 --> 01:21:01,408
Well, it don't matter. Listen to me.
I thought you might like to meet her.

1062
01:21:01,484 --> 01:21:04,749
Vaughan wants to have a little supper
over at his house, and we could invite her.

1063
01:21:04,821 --> 01:21:07,153
Would you like that?

1064
01:21:08,091 --> 01:21:11,618
I reckon I wouldn't mind
having a little supper. Mm-hm.

1065
01:21:11,695 --> 01:21:15,654
Vaughan's friend'll be there,
too. He works at the funeral home.

1066
01:21:15,732 --> 01:21:17,461
And Frank.

1067
01:21:17,534 --> 01:21:19,866
You know, Frank really likes you a lot.

1068
01:21:19,936 --> 01:21:22,666
He says you make him feel calm.

1069
01:21:22,739 --> 01:21:26,231
I like Frank. He's a good boy.

1070
01:21:26,309 --> 01:21:28,641
Me and him's made friends.

1071
01:21:36,152 --> 01:21:42,216
It ain't right for me to keep from telling
you how come me to be in the state hospital.

1072
01:21:42,292 --> 01:21:45,728
Oh, that's OK. It's
not really my business.

1073
01:21:46,696 --> 01:21:49,358
I have wondered, though.

1074
01:21:49,432 --> 01:21:53,766
Why was it? Was it, like,
a nervous breakdown? Or...?

1075
01:21:59,509 --> 01:22:04,071
I killed my mother and an
old boy named Jesse Dixon.

1076
01:22:04,147 --> 01:22:06,581
I thought they were doing wrong.

1077
01:22:07,517 --> 01:22:10,145
I was about your boy's age.

1078
01:22:10,220 --> 01:22:14,350
- They told me I'm well from it now.
- Was that you?

1079
01:22:14,424 --> 01:22:19,361
I remember that. I was only three or four,
but I always heard about it growing up.

1080
01:22:19,429 --> 01:22:22,227
They say you're well?

1081
01:22:22,299 --> 01:22:24,460
Yes, ma'am.

1082
01:22:30,807 --> 01:22:33,139
I like your garage.

1083
01:22:36,980 --> 01:22:39,505
I never would hurt you or that boy.

1084
01:22:40,450 --> 01:22:44,648
I'd lay my hand on the Bible
and say the same thing. Mm-hm.

1085
01:22:44,721 --> 01:22:47,053
I know you wouldn't, hon.

1086
01:22:54,297 --> 01:22:57,198
Well, I'll make you some biscuits.

1087
01:23:11,681 --> 01:23:14,343
- (Bill) How about you, Jerry?
- How are you, Bill?

1088
01:23:14,417 --> 01:23:17,614
Oh, I'm doing pretty good.
Got a sick tiller here.

1089
01:23:17,687 --> 01:23:19,177
What's got you down this way?

1090
01:23:19,255 --> 01:23:22,156
Oh, I just thought I'd check up on
Karl. See how things are working out.

1091
01:23:22,225 --> 01:23:25,524
He's pretty quiet, except for them
rackets and breathing things he does.

1092
01:23:25,595 --> 01:23:27,995
He ain't threatened me
with a killing or nothing.

1093
01:23:28,064 --> 01:23:30,396
I tell you, you couldn't have been
more right about him fixing things.

1094
01:23:30,467 --> 01:23:34,995
That son of a bitch is a regular Eli Whitney
on a lawn mower. And loves French fries.

1095
01:23:35,071 --> 01:23:38,040
The son of a bitch can eat four
larges and won't so much as even belch.

1096
01:23:38,108 --> 01:23:39,735
I'm proud to have him.

1097
01:23:39,809 --> 01:23:42,676
- Him staying here working out?
- Well, he's gone to staying over

1098
01:23:42,746 --> 01:23:45,180
with that Wheatley boy and
his momma over at their garage.

1099
01:23:45,248 --> 01:23:48,183
I think that little boy's adopted
him damn near like a mascot.

1100
01:23:48,251 --> 01:23:50,742
He's got a key here to
come and go as he pleases.

1101
01:23:50,820 --> 01:23:52,583
- Yeah.
- He's working out real good.

1102
01:23:52,655 --> 01:23:55,146
- Can I see him?
- Sure. Scooter!

1103
01:23:55,191 --> 01:23:58,922
- Take Jerry in there to talk to Karl.
- All right.

1104
01:23:59,729 --> 01:24:01,890
Hey, Karl!

1105
01:24:03,733 --> 01:24:07,260
Sure you're gonna be OK staying
with that woman and her boy?

1106
01:24:07,337 --> 01:24:09,100
Yes, sir.

1107
01:24:09,172 --> 01:24:11,868
Do they know about you?

1108
01:24:11,941 --> 01:24:13,841
My history?

1109
01:24:13,910 --> 01:24:15,707
Yeah.

1110
01:24:15,779 --> 01:24:18,111
I told 'em about it.

1111
01:24:20,617 --> 01:24:22,949
They know I'm well.

1112
01:24:24,020 --> 01:24:27,319
That Ms. Wheatley made me some biscuits.

1113
01:24:27,390 --> 01:24:29,756
I'll be!

1114
01:24:29,826 --> 01:24:32,488
That boy, he's my friend.

1115
01:24:33,396 --> 01:24:38,356
He likes the way I talk, and
I like the way he talks. Mm-hm.

1116
01:24:38,435 --> 01:24:43,065
Well, I knew you were gonna be all
right. I just wanted to check on you.

1117
01:24:43,139 --> 01:24:46,939
I'd better tell Bill
goodbye and head on back.

1118
01:24:47,010 --> 01:24:49,171
All right, then.

1119
01:24:53,950 --> 01:24:56,145
(Bill) Karl, see if you can figure
out what's wrong with this thing.

1120
01:24:56,219 --> 01:24:59,746
It won't crank up, and everything
seems to be put together right.

1121
01:24:59,823 --> 01:25:02,451
- Bill, I'll see you.
- OK. Stop back by.

1122
01:25:02,892 --> 01:25:06,658
Don't worry about your
boy now. He's doing good.

1123
01:25:06,729 --> 01:25:09,698
It ain't got no gas in it.

1124
01:25:09,766 --> 01:25:14,965
(Bill) You see there, Scooter?
Thinks of the simplest things first.

1125
01:25:15,038 --> 01:25:17,302
Does everybody like the food?

1126
01:25:17,373 --> 01:25:18,533
- Yeah.
- It's good.

1127
01:25:18,608 --> 01:25:22,738
Oh, good. I haven't decided
yet if I'm a good cook.

1128
01:25:24,447 --> 01:25:26,039
Karl, you know what?

1129
01:25:26,116 --> 01:25:30,951
Melinda here was voted employee of the
month at the Dollar Store last February.

1130
01:25:31,020 --> 01:25:33,648
Isn't that something?

1131
01:25:33,723 --> 01:25:35,884
Yes, ma'am, I reckon.

1132
01:25:35,959 --> 01:25:39,690
Well, when you like pricing
items as much as I do,

1133
01:25:39,762 --> 01:25:43,596
it's just bound to happen
sooner or later, I guess.

1134
01:25:43,666 --> 01:25:45,293
Karl,

1135
01:25:45,368 --> 01:25:49,464
maybe you and Melinda might
like to take a walk tonight.

1136
01:25:49,539 --> 01:25:51,530
It's such a nice evening.

1137
01:25:51,608 --> 01:25:54,907
- Vaughan, don't get pushy.
- I'm sorry.

1138
01:25:56,679 --> 01:25:59,944
I kinda like walking from time to time.

1139
01:26:00,016 --> 01:26:02,849
I stay on my feet all the time at work.

1140
01:26:02,919 --> 01:26:06,355
I just can't find shoes
that's comfortable.

1141
01:26:06,422 --> 01:26:10,654
Hospital shoes might be
the answer. Nurse's shoes.

1142
01:26:10,727 --> 01:26:13,491
Or the kind old ladies wear who
work in the school cafeteria.

1143
01:26:13,563 --> 01:26:16,088
Same difference.

1144
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,862
I get real mean when my feet hurt.

1145
01:26:18,935 --> 01:26:22,371
It's the only time I don't
like checking out customers,

1146
01:26:22,438 --> 01:26:25,305
when my feet hurt.

1147
01:26:25,375 --> 01:26:30,403
You and Karl aren't talking much.
You boys must really like that food.

1148
01:26:30,480 --> 01:26:33,643
Well, I ain't got nothing to say
- anything about shoes.

1149
01:26:33,716 --> 01:26:36,310
Listen, everybody. I...

1150
01:26:36,386 --> 01:26:39,378
This might sound corny, but, um...

1151
01:26:40,390 --> 01:26:43,382
I've had a few glasses of wine, and
that tends to make me a little emotional,

1152
01:26:43,459 --> 01:26:45,427
but I'm gonna say it anyway.

1153
01:26:45,495 --> 01:26:48,089
It came over me in a rush.

1154
01:26:48,164 --> 01:26:50,655
I just want all of you to know

1155
01:26:50,700 --> 01:26:54,898
that I care about each and
every person at this table.

1156
01:26:55,905 --> 01:26:59,466
Thank you, Vaughan. That's really
sweet of you. We care about you, too.

1157
01:26:59,542 --> 01:27:01,908
- Don't we, y'all?
- Oh, yeah.

1158
01:27:01,978 --> 01:27:05,778
Also, Melinda, please don't
tell anyone at the store

1159
01:27:05,848 --> 01:27:08,783
that Albert was here tonight.

1160
01:27:10,587 --> 01:27:12,578
OK?

1161
01:27:13,823 --> 01:27:15,620
Why?

1162
01:27:15,692 --> 01:27:21,688
Well, you know how this town is. People
talk and they spread these cruel rumors.

1163
01:27:21,764 --> 01:27:26,997
Unfortunately, there are certain parts
of my life I have to keep private.

1164
01:27:27,070 --> 01:27:31,507
You mean about you and Albert
being together in that way?

1165
01:27:31,574 --> 01:27:32,563
Yeah. Yes.

1166
01:27:32,642 --> 01:27:35,509
I think everybody at
the store already knows.

1167
01:27:35,578 --> 01:27:37,842
They're always talking about it.

1168
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:41,315
Maureen Ledbetter told
the most awful story

1169
01:27:41,384 --> 01:27:44,979
about why you ain't allowed at
the First Baptist Church no more.

1170
01:27:45,054 --> 01:27:50,082
Karl, why don't you and Melinda
go take a walk? It's nice out.

1171
01:27:55,231 --> 01:27:57,392
All right, then.

1172
01:28:06,943 --> 01:28:09,537
- The food sure
is good. - Mm-hm.

1173
01:28:15,952 --> 01:28:19,046
- You walk fast, don't you?
- I reckon.

1174
01:28:21,958 --> 01:28:25,758
These are the worst
shoes I own for walking.

1175
01:28:25,828 --> 01:28:28,319
How far did you say you wanted to go?

1176
01:28:28,364 --> 01:28:31,856
I don't reckon I thought
about it too much.

1177
01:28:33,503 --> 01:28:37,064
I don't know, Karl. She
just ain't catching fire.

1178
01:28:37,140 --> 01:28:39,472
Did you check them points?

1179
01:28:40,777 --> 01:28:43,041
No. No, I didn't.

1180
01:28:43,112 --> 01:28:45,273
That's probably it.

1181
01:28:47,116 --> 01:28:49,607
- (Bill) Yes, ma'am.
- (Melinda.) Is Karl here?

1182
01:28:49,652 --> 01:28:51,984
(Bill) Yeah. Just a minute.

1183
01:28:54,924 --> 01:28:57,415
Hey, Karl, there's somebody
out here to see you.

1184
01:28:57,493 --> 01:29:00,553
Some gal holding a nice bouquet.

1185
01:29:00,630 --> 01:29:05,567
Come on, now, she wants to talk
to you. Don't just sit there.

1186
01:29:18,848 --> 01:29:21,442
Hi, Karl, I'm on my lunch break.

1187
01:29:22,518 --> 01:29:25,510
These were on sale
'cause they're not fresh.

1188
01:29:25,588 --> 01:29:29,786
$ 2.99 a bunch plus my ten
percent employee discount.

1189
01:29:30,793 --> 01:29:35,423
Since I didn't bring nothing
for you on our date last night,

1190
01:29:35,498 --> 01:29:38,490
I thought you might like to have 'em.

1191
01:29:45,942 --> 01:29:47,773
Thank you.

1192
01:29:47,844 --> 01:29:50,244
Scooter, let's you and me
go over to the Frostee Cream

1193
01:29:50,313 --> 01:29:52,645
- and pick up something for lunchtime.
- Oh, well, I can go.

1194
01:29:52,715 --> 01:29:54,580
You don't have to. You don't never go.

1195
01:29:54,650 --> 01:29:57,448
Goddamnit, Scooter, come on. Let's go.

1196
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,852
Pardon my language, ma'am.

1197
01:30:04,026 --> 01:30:07,860
Darlin'

1198
01:30:09,232 --> 01:30:11,894
Lord above me

1199
01:30:15,671 --> 01:30:18,663
Well, I just thought I'd bring you 'em.

1200
01:30:19,609 --> 01:30:21,770
I liked walking with you.

1201
01:30:21,844 --> 01:30:25,780
I got a blister the size
of a quarter on one heel.

1202
01:30:27,517 --> 01:30:28,950
Well...

1203
01:30:29,018 --> 01:30:31,612
I'll see you sometime, I guess.

1204
01:30:37,226 --> 01:30:39,922
A blister sure can hurt. Mm-hm.

1205
01:30:41,931 --> 01:30:43,455
Yeah.

1206
01:30:47,737 --> 01:30:49,762
Flowers is purdy.

1207
01:30:49,839 --> 01:30:52,239
I've always thought that. Mm-hm.

1208
01:30:55,278 --> 01:30:57,439
Me, too.

1209
01:31:00,917 --> 01:31:04,751
Then you fix me a cup of tea

1210
01:31:05,988 --> 01:31:10,322
Darlin'. You're so damn swweet

1211
01:31:13,763 --> 01:31:16,596
Don't forget the milk

1212
01:31:19,469 --> 01:31:22,802
And wwherever! Go

1213
01:31:25,675 --> 01:31:28,838
And wwhatever! Do

1214
01:31:30,847 --> 01:31:34,180
Darlin'

1215
01:31:35,985 --> 01:31:38,647
! love you

1216
01:31:47,296 --> 01:31:50,561
Hey, Karl, how did you
know I was in the garage?

1217
01:31:50,633 --> 01:31:52,828
I seen that door
cracked open a little bit

1218
01:31:52,902 --> 01:31:55,928
and I figured you was in
there fooling around. Mm-hm.

1219
01:31:56,005 --> 01:31:58,496
- You off of work?
- Yes, sir.

1220
01:31:58,574 --> 01:32:01,372
Where'd you get them flowers?

1221
01:32:01,444 --> 01:32:04,743
That gal that made employee of
the month at the Dollar Store,

1222
01:32:04,814 --> 01:32:08,011
she gave 'em to me for walking with her.

1223
01:32:09,252 --> 01:32:11,686
I was going over to the secret place.

1224
01:32:11,754 --> 01:32:15,121
I borrowed one of your
books. You ain't mad, are you?

1225
01:32:15,191 --> 01:32:18,058
No, sir. You can look at any
one of my books you want to.

1226
01:32:18,127 --> 01:32:21,585
Thank you. It's name's
A Christmas Carol.

1227
01:32:21,664 --> 01:32:25,464
That's that one on Christmas
I was telling you about.

1228
01:32:25,535 --> 01:32:28,504
Well, you wanna go with me?

1229
01:32:28,571 --> 01:32:30,334
All right, then.

1230
01:32:30,406 --> 01:32:32,203
Yeah. Come on.

1231
01:32:32,275 --> 01:32:34,436
All right.

1232
01:32:40,883 --> 01:32:43,215
(Frank) You know why I want
you to play ball with me?

1233
01:32:43,286 --> 01:32:44,514
(Karl) No.

1234
01:32:44,587 --> 01:32:48,114
(Frank) 'Cause it's fun. It
don't matter if you ain't no good.

1235
01:32:48,190 --> 01:32:50,681
It takes your mind off everything else,

1236
01:32:50,760 --> 01:32:53,695
and when you're running real
fast trying to score a touchdown,

1237
01:32:53,763 --> 01:32:56,288
that's all you're thinking about.

1238
01:32:56,365 --> 01:33:00,199
I ain't no account, but Daddy
always said he was proud of me

1239
01:33:00,269 --> 01:33:03,329
when I threw the ball or ran with it.

1240
01:33:03,406 --> 01:33:07,809
Did you have any brothers and
sisters, growing up, to play with?

1241
01:33:07,877 --> 01:33:10,141
I had one there for a little bit,

1242
01:33:10,947 --> 01:33:13,142
but, uh...

1243
01:33:13,215 --> 01:33:16,343
it didn't get old enough for
me to play with it. Mm-hm.

1244
01:33:16,419 --> 01:33:18,751
Why not? It died?

1245
01:33:18,821 --> 01:33:20,755
Yes, sir.

1246
01:33:20,823 --> 01:33:23,348
Why?

1247
01:33:23,426 --> 01:33:26,020
It got born a little too early.

1248
01:33:26,462 --> 01:33:31,559
My mother and father, they made it
come out too early some way or another.

1249
01:33:31,634 --> 01:33:34,125
So it died when it come out?

1250
01:33:35,438 --> 01:33:38,874
My daddy, he come out
there to the shed and got me

1251
01:33:38,941 --> 01:33:41,569
and said, "Here, take
this and throw it away,"

1252
01:33:41,644 --> 01:33:46,081
and he handed me a towel
with something or other in it.

1253
01:33:48,117 --> 01:33:53,919
I started for that barrel, and... I opened
up the towel to see what was in there,

1254
01:33:53,990 --> 01:33:59,223
'cause there was a noise and
something moving around in it.

1255
01:33:59,295 --> 01:34:03,732
That towel was all bloody-like,
all around it there.

1256
01:34:08,137 --> 01:34:12,437
It was a little old baby,
not no bigger than a squirrel.

1257
01:34:13,209 --> 01:34:15,268
It was alive?

1258
01:34:15,344 --> 01:34:18,006
Yes, sir. Right then it was.

1259
01:34:19,682 --> 01:34:22,480
A boy or a girl?

1260
01:34:22,551 --> 01:34:24,883
It was a little old boy.

1261
01:34:26,889 --> 01:34:29,323
You threw it in the trash barrel?

1262
01:34:30,026 --> 01:34:32,859
Well, that didn't seem right to me,

1263
01:34:32,928 --> 01:34:35,226
so I went in there in the
shed and got a shoe box

1264
01:34:35,297 --> 01:34:41,167
and emptied out the screwdrivers and
washers and nuts and things out of it.

1265
01:34:41,237 --> 01:34:44,502
I taken the little fella
and put him in the box,

1266
01:34:44,573 --> 01:34:48,065
buried him out there in
the corner of the yard.

1267
01:34:48,144 --> 01:34:51,113
That seemed more proper to me, I reckon.

1268
01:34:51,914 --> 01:34:55,509
It was still alive when you buried it?

1269
01:34:55,584 --> 01:34:59,179
I heard it a-cryin' a
little through that box.

1270
01:35:03,592 --> 01:35:07,460
That don't seem right. It seems like you
would have kept him and took care of him

1271
01:35:07,530 --> 01:35:09,555
if he was your brother.

1272
01:35:09,632 --> 01:35:15,161
I wasn't but six or eight. I
reckon I didn't know what to do.

1273
01:35:15,237 --> 01:35:18,502
I didn't know how to care for no baby.

1274
01:35:18,574 --> 01:35:21,668
My mother and father didn't want him.

1275
01:35:22,578 --> 01:35:25,843
They learned me to do
what they told me to do.

1276
01:35:26,649 --> 01:35:28,844
These days I figure it was probably best

1277
01:35:28,918 --> 01:35:33,855
we just give him right back to the
Good Lord right off the bat anyhow.

1278
01:35:34,290 --> 01:35:36,781
That makes me feel real sad.

1279
01:35:37,860 --> 01:35:40,158
Couldn't you have done something, Karl?

1280
01:35:40,229 --> 01:35:42,720
I would have. I wish I'd had him.

1281
01:35:42,798 --> 01:35:44,891
He'd still be right here now.

1282
01:35:44,967 --> 01:35:46,696
Living.

1283
01:35:48,037 --> 01:35:50,369
It makes me sad, too.

1284
01:35:51,006 --> 01:35:55,340
I wish there was something
I could have did about it.

1285
01:35:57,079 --> 01:36:01,413
I don't think nothing bad
oughta happen to children.

1286
01:36:01,484 --> 01:36:05,648
I think all the old bad things ought to be
saved up for the folks that done growed up.

1287
01:36:05,721 --> 01:36:08,212
That's the way I see it. Mm-hm.

1288
01:36:11,360 --> 01:36:14,488
I shouldn't have told you about that.

1289
01:36:14,563 --> 01:36:18,021
A boy your age ought
not to hear such things.

1290
01:36:18,100 --> 01:36:20,261
It just kinda come out.

1291
01:36:21,070 --> 01:36:23,937
I didn't mean to say
nothing bad about you.

1292
01:36:24,006 --> 01:36:26,839
You're good. You don't mean no harm.

1293
01:36:28,144 --> 01:36:33,878
Did you ever think about killing
yourself on purpose, like Daddy did?

1294
01:36:35,317 --> 01:36:37,649
I've studied about it some.

1295
01:36:38,654 --> 01:36:41,145
The Bible says you ought not to.

1296
01:36:42,625 --> 01:36:46,061
Says if you do that,
you go out to Hades.

1297
01:36:46,128 --> 01:36:50,428
Some folks call it hell,
I call it Hades. Mm-hm.

1298
01:36:50,499 --> 01:36:54,936
Bible says the same thing
about killing others, too.

1299
01:37:03,946 --> 01:37:06,278
Yes, sir, I reckon it does.

1300
01:37:22,965 --> 01:37:25,092
(Doorbell)

1301
01:37:25,167 --> 01:37:28,068
I always get nervous
when I hear that doorbell.

1302
01:37:28,137 --> 01:37:32,631
I'm OK walking over here, but there's
something about that dang doorbell.

1303
01:37:32,708 --> 01:37:36,542
They have one room where you can't walk
on the carpet or sit on the furniture.

1304
01:37:36,612 --> 01:37:39,513
I don't see much sense in having it.

1305
01:37:44,453 --> 01:37:47,286
Son, why you keep on coming over here

1306
01:37:47,356 --> 01:37:49,756
and you know these folks
don't want you here?

1307
01:37:49,825 --> 01:37:52,225
They run you away every time.

1308
01:37:52,294 --> 01:37:56,253
Don't keep doing this to
yourself. You's a sweet boy.

1309
01:37:56,332 --> 01:38:00,428
Why don't you go and give them flowers
to somebody that's gonna enjoy 'em?

1310
01:38:00,502 --> 01:38:03,528
Ma'am, I really wanna
give them to Karen.

1311
01:38:06,108 --> 01:38:08,406
You his daddy?

1312
01:38:08,477 --> 01:38:10,911
No, ma'am.

1313
01:38:10,980 --> 01:38:14,108
Well, whoever you are, you need
to try to talk some sense into him.

1314
01:38:14,183 --> 01:38:19,246
That little old girl is too fast for
him, and she don't wanna see him no way.

1315
01:38:19,321 --> 01:38:22,620
Will you get her for me,
please? I really wanna see her.

1316
01:38:22,691 --> 01:38:25,683
She'll want to see me, too,
'cause we're not in public.

1317
01:38:25,761 --> 01:38:29,060
Just don't tell her folks that I'm here.

1318
01:38:31,967 --> 01:38:33,958
OK.

1319
01:38:50,185 --> 01:38:53,882
Hey, Frank, you shouldn't be coming over
here. My parents really don't want you to.

1320
01:38:53,956 --> 01:38:57,585
I wanted to bring you some
flowers. They're pretty good ones.

1321
01:38:57,660 --> 01:38:59,890
They're from the Dollar
Store. I'm not an idiot.

1322
01:38:59,962 --> 01:39:03,227
Besides, we have a
garden full of flowers.

1323
01:39:03,299 --> 01:39:06,325
And I wanted you to meet
Karl. He's my new friend,

1324
01:39:06,402 --> 01:39:08,529
but it seems like I've always known him.

1325
01:39:08,604 --> 01:39:10,902
I thought you should meet him.

1326
01:39:10,973 --> 01:39:12,531
Hi, Karl.

1327
01:39:12,608 --> 01:39:14,542
Pleased to meet you.

1328
01:39:14,610 --> 01:39:16,874
He'll be around for a long time,

1329
01:39:16,946 --> 01:39:19,244
and I hope you will too, so...

1330
01:39:19,315 --> 01:39:23,809
Here. Give me the flowers. I'll do
something with them. Now you better go.

1331
01:39:23,886 --> 01:39:28,118
Maybe I'll see you down at the secret
place one day in a week or two or something.

1332
01:39:28,190 --> 01:39:32,627
I have a boyfriend now, you know, and
we're pretty serious. He gave me a ring.

1333
01:39:32,695 --> 01:39:35,186
Can you go with us
now? With me and Karl?

1334
01:39:35,264 --> 01:39:37,994
We could just hang out.
He has some cool books.

1335
01:39:38,067 --> 01:39:41,696
Frank, I just like you as a friend,
and only at the secret place.

1336
01:39:41,770 --> 01:39:44,898
I can't go there now.
I'll see you later.

1337
01:39:44,974 --> 01:39:47,670
- But just for a while.
- I'm closing the door now.

1338
01:39:48,610 --> 01:39:51,101
I told you, I'll see you later.

1339
01:39:56,852 --> 01:40:00,879
She said she'd see me later.
That's kinda good, right?

1340
01:40:00,956 --> 01:40:03,117
I reckon.

1341
01:40:06,695 --> 01:40:08,686
Well, hell, there's the boys.

1342
01:40:08,764 --> 01:40:12,723
How are you doing, boys?
I'm glad y'all came back.

1343
01:40:12,801 --> 01:40:16,168
I was wanting to talk to y'all,
too. Come over here and sit down.

1344
01:40:16,238 --> 01:40:18,331
Come on, sit down.

1345
01:40:18,407 --> 01:40:24,004
I was just telling Linda... We were, uh,
thinking that things would be a lot better

1346
01:40:24,079 --> 01:40:27,207
if I spent a lot more time over here,

1347
01:40:27,282 --> 01:40:29,807
and that we could...

1348
01:40:29,885 --> 01:40:32,080
Oh, hell, I'll just start over.

1349
01:40:32,154 --> 01:40:35,146
See, I took off work early today, and
your momma was good enough to do the same

1350
01:40:35,224 --> 01:40:37,784
so that we could talk.

1351
01:40:37,860 --> 01:40:41,159
Really, what I come over
here to do was apologize -

1352
01:40:41,230 --> 01:40:43,391
which ain't easy for me -

1353
01:40:43,465 --> 01:40:46,025
about how I acted the other night.

1354
01:40:46,969 --> 01:40:49,130
Now, I admit it, I was drunk.

1355
01:40:49,938 --> 01:40:53,874
I got all worked up, and
one thing led to another.

1356
01:40:54,910 --> 01:40:58,311
I care about y'all,
though. I do, really.

1357
01:40:59,381 --> 01:41:02,145
And I don't mean to be so damned...

1358
01:41:03,185 --> 01:41:06,780
well, asshole-ish, I
guess would be the word.

1359
01:41:07,623 --> 01:41:10,353
Karl, I don't believe I hit you, did I?

1360
01:41:10,426 --> 01:41:13,452
So no apology necessary, I guess.

1361
01:41:13,529 --> 01:41:15,895
But Frankie, I'm sorry.

1362
01:41:15,964 --> 01:41:18,194
I'm sorry I hit your momma.

1363
01:41:19,168 --> 01:41:21,602
It's just that I'm jealous of her.

1364
01:41:22,471 --> 01:41:25,531
I don't like her life
or how she lives it.

1365
01:41:26,475 --> 01:41:30,605
I don't like homosexuals, and she
goes out and buddies up with one,

1366
01:41:30,679 --> 01:41:33,239
so now I gotta deal with that.

1367
01:41:33,315 --> 01:41:36,341
I don't like little wimpy-ass
kids or mental retards,

1368
01:41:36,418 --> 01:41:40,320
and she's got one of
each living with her.

1369
01:41:40,389 --> 01:41:43,381
I'm just kidding really about that.

1370
01:41:44,359 --> 01:41:50,059
I mean, we all gotta get along, I guess,
no matter what our differences are.

1371
01:41:50,132 --> 01:41:52,464
See, I work construction.

1372
01:41:52,534 --> 01:41:54,502
I build things.

1373
01:41:54,570 --> 01:41:59,234
Do you understand how important
that is to the world, Frankie?

1374
01:41:59,308 --> 01:42:03,768
I don't know if y'all realize the
pressure a man like me's got on him.

1375
01:42:05,080 --> 01:42:08,777
Well, the upshot is, I'm gonna
be spending a lot more time here.

1376
01:42:08,851 --> 01:42:13,117
We're gonna all get along
like a family should.

1377
01:42:13,188 --> 01:42:17,682
I might even surprise you,
honey, and pop the question.

1378
01:42:21,563 --> 01:42:23,724
Well,

1379
01:42:23,799 --> 01:42:29,032
I'm gonna get on back over to the job
site, lock up some stuff over there.

1380
01:42:29,104 --> 01:42:35,339
I just wanted to stop by and... give
y'all some little piece of happiness today.

1381
01:42:35,410 --> 01:42:38,174
Bye-bye, sweetie.

1382
01:42:38,247 --> 01:42:40,340
Karl.

1383
01:42:40,415 --> 01:42:42,406
Frankie,

1384
01:42:42,484 --> 01:42:45,282
you be a good boy, now, you hear me?

1385
01:42:51,894 --> 01:42:57,127
Well, at least he's trying.
But who knows for how long?

1386
01:42:58,333 --> 01:43:02,201
He's lying, Momma.
He'll never do better.

1387
01:43:02,271 --> 01:43:04,432
I know, honey.

1388
01:43:06,141 --> 01:43:09,440
Just remember what I
said. We'll bide our time.

1389
01:43:09,511 --> 01:43:13,470
You just steer clear of
him as much as you can.

1390
01:43:13,549 --> 01:43:18,452
Doyle's had a real hard life. It's
just about run him crazy, I think.

1391
01:43:18,520 --> 01:43:21,182
We've had hard lives, too, Momma.

1392
01:43:24,193 --> 01:43:26,593
You're a hell of a boy, Frank.

1393
01:43:28,397 --> 01:43:33,391
Someday you're gonna get all
the good things you deserve.

1394
01:43:33,468 --> 01:43:39,236
Karl here's gonna get some more biscuits
tonight. What do you think about that?

1395
01:43:39,308 --> 01:43:41,640
I could sure use some.

1396
01:43:49,418 --> 01:43:53,548
Hey, there, Karl. Come
unload a generator for me.

1397
01:44:04,299 --> 01:44:08,326
Karl, lift this thing down and carry it
to the back for me. It's on the blink.

1398
01:44:08,403 --> 01:44:10,030
Say, you want us to
help you lift that thing?

1399
01:44:10,105 --> 01:44:15,372
Oh, no. That Karl's strong enough to lift
a bulldozer. He can fix anything, too.

1400
01:44:15,444 --> 01:44:19,710
I tell you, he's mentally retarded,
but he's a whiz with small engines.

1401
01:44:19,781 --> 01:44:22,807
I tell you, the Lord
works in mysterious ways.

1402
01:44:22,884 --> 01:44:26,547
So, anyway, what I was telling you
was, he didn't just make the team,

1403
01:44:26,622 --> 01:44:30,149
coach says he's going to
start him at end on defense.

1404
01:44:30,225 --> 01:44:33,160
There's a chip off the old
block, ain't you, Steve?

1405
01:44:33,228 --> 01:44:34,217
Yeah, I guess so.

1406
01:44:34,296 --> 01:44:36,389
(Bill) And how's the rest of
the team looking this year?

1407
01:44:36,465 --> 01:44:38,729
Pretty good. Pretty good.
We expect to do well.

1408
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:41,064
- (Bill) You got any quarterback this year?
- (Walter) Pretty good.

1409
01:44:41,136 --> 01:44:43,832
Jeff Bailey's boy, you know him.
Got a good arm, a little slow.

1410
01:44:43,905 --> 01:44:46,738
(Bill) Yeah, I watched him in junior high.
He can... he can throw the ball pretty well.

1411
01:44:46,808 --> 01:44:50,209
He's taller than he was then. But
you're gonna start at the defensive end?

1412
01:44:53,649 --> 01:44:55,173
Hey, boy.

1413
01:44:55,250 --> 01:44:57,241
Hey.

1414
01:44:58,820 --> 01:45:03,553
- What are you reading?
- Book on how to work carpentry.

1415
01:45:03,625 --> 01:45:07,891
I aim to learn how to make
things out of wood some day.

1416
01:45:07,963 --> 01:45:10,932
Cabinets and whatnot.

1417
01:45:10,999 --> 01:45:16,027
These drawings in here, they
don't make no sense to me so far.

1418
01:45:18,240 --> 01:45:21,141
You look like your tail's
kinda dragging a mite.

1419
01:45:21,209 --> 01:45:23,700
You got something wrong with you?

1420
01:45:23,779 --> 01:45:27,044
Seems like Doyle's made his way in.

1421
01:45:27,115 --> 01:45:32,553
Momma said he's staying over tonight, and
he's talking about staying here for good.

1422
01:45:32,621 --> 01:45:38,218
We ain't ever gonna be happy. We'll
always stay nervous, won't we, Karl?

1423
01:45:39,027 --> 01:45:41,359
I don't reckon I know, boy.

1424
01:45:42,331 --> 01:45:45,164
I ain't never found no
way to not be nervous.

1425
01:45:45,233 --> 01:45:48,532
I'm three or four
times as old as you are.

1426
01:45:50,238 --> 01:45:53,139
Maybe that's just the way folks is.

1427
01:45:53,975 --> 01:45:57,138
I feel sad about Karen Cross, too.

1428
01:45:57,212 --> 01:46:00,807
I just make like to
myself that she loves me.

1429
01:46:02,017 --> 01:46:03,985
I know better, though,

1430
01:46:04,052 --> 01:46:07,351
but it just feels
good when I imagine it.

1431
01:46:08,590 --> 01:46:14,426
Making believe always made me feel
pretty good too, from time to time.

1432
01:46:22,604 --> 01:46:25,630
Bill Cox is going to a funeral
for a Mr. Turner tomorrow

1433
01:46:25,707 --> 01:46:28,198
and closing up shop early. Mm-hm.

1434
01:46:28,243 --> 01:46:30,575
- Is that right?
- Yes, sir.

1435
01:46:33,782 --> 01:46:36,580
I figured I'd play ball with you.

1436
01:46:38,520 --> 01:46:41,114
You will? For sure?

1437
01:46:41,189 --> 01:46:43,885
Yes, sir. Well, I figure if
neither one of us is no account,

1438
01:46:43,959 --> 01:46:46,325
it won't make no difference, will it?

1439
01:46:46,395 --> 01:46:47,623
Yeah.

1440
01:46:47,696 --> 01:46:50,187
You wanna be on teams, me and you?

1441
01:46:50,232 --> 01:46:51,631
Yes, sir.

1442
01:46:51,700 --> 01:46:53,065
All right, then.

1443
01:46:53,301 --> 01:46:55,462
All right, then.

1444
01:46:58,173 --> 01:47:00,164
Hup!

1445
01:47:01,042 --> 01:47:03,602
Come on, man.

1446
01:47:09,184 --> 01:47:11,880
Good job, Karl. We got a touchdown.

1447
01:47:12,687 --> 01:47:14,587
That was a good lateral, man.

1448
01:47:14,656 --> 01:47:17,819
That was just like the wishbone.

1449
01:47:17,893 --> 01:47:21,693
Yes, sir. Well, I darn
near made me a touchdown.

1450
01:47:21,763 --> 01:47:25,529
Then I seen them boys bearing down on me,
figured I'd better give it off to you there.

1451
01:47:25,600 --> 01:47:27,568
I seen you following me. Mm-hm.

1452
01:47:27,636 --> 01:47:31,163
Yeah. We're liable to
win if we keep this up.

1453
01:47:31,239 --> 01:47:34,299
For somebody like you,
you sure can run fast.

1454
01:47:34,376 --> 01:47:38,176
- Come on, let's kick off to 'em.
- All right, then.

1455
01:47:42,884 --> 01:47:45,580
I know you could've scored
that touchdown by yourself

1456
01:47:45,654 --> 01:47:48,384
instead of just throwing it over to me.

1457
01:47:48,957 --> 01:47:52,017
Them boys was trying to
pull me down pretty hard.

1458
01:47:52,093 --> 01:47:54,926
You're strong, though. You
just threw it over to me

1459
01:47:54,996 --> 01:47:57,863
where I could score that
touchdown so I'd feel good.

1460
01:47:57,933 --> 01:48:01,027
My daddy used to do that kind of thing.

1461
01:48:03,705 --> 01:48:06,833
It don't matter to me about
us losing. Does it to you?

1462
01:48:06,908 --> 01:48:08,637
No, sir.

1463
01:48:08,710 --> 01:48:10,644
It was fun anyhow.

1464
01:48:10,712 --> 01:48:15,274
I wasn't thinking about nothing
else, just like you told me I'd do.

1465
01:48:15,350 --> 01:48:17,841
Can we play every Saturday?

1466
01:48:17,919 --> 01:48:19,910
If I ain't too stoved up.

1467
01:48:19,988 --> 01:48:23,185
I ain't like you. I'm old and give out.

1468
01:48:26,094 --> 01:48:28,426
I'm proud of you.

1469
01:50:25,480 --> 01:50:27,471
(Muttering.)

1470
01:50:43,732 --> 01:50:46,462
Kick your head in 25 years ago.

1471
01:50:46,534 --> 01:50:49,833
You're dead, I guess. Where'd you go to?

1472
01:50:53,108 --> 01:50:55,099
(Muttering.)

1473
01:51:00,081 --> 01:51:02,072
(Chuckling.)

1474
01:51:09,958 --> 01:51:12,119
I'm your boy.

1475
01:51:15,263 --> 01:51:17,595
I ain't got no boy.

1476
01:51:20,435 --> 01:51:23,370
I'm your oldest boy, name of Karl.

1477
01:51:23,438 --> 01:51:25,770
I ain't got no boy.

1478
01:51:28,543 --> 01:51:34,482
They turned me loose from the nervous
hospital, said I was well. Mm-hm.

1479
01:51:42,257 --> 01:51:48,594
I got hired on to work for a Mr. Bill
Cox, fixing lawn mowers and whatnot. Mm-hm.

1480
01:51:50,799 --> 01:51:54,462
That grass out there in the
yard, it's growed up quite a bit.

1481
01:51:54,536 --> 01:51:58,199
I figured I might
cut it for you. Mm-hm.

1482
01:51:58,273 --> 01:52:03,370
I told you, I ain't got no boy. Now, why
don't you get on outta here and let me be?

1483
01:52:03,445 --> 01:52:06,312
You ain't no kin to me.

1484
01:52:09,684 --> 01:52:12,016
I learned to read some.

1485
01:52:15,724 --> 01:52:18,056
I read the Bible quite a bit.

1486
01:52:24,099 --> 01:52:29,901
I can't understand all of it, but I
reckon I understand a good deal of it.

1487
01:52:29,971 --> 01:52:34,101
Them stories you and Momma
told me, they ain't in there.

1488
01:52:36,077 --> 01:52:38,910
You oughta not done that to your boy.

1489
01:52:41,015 --> 01:52:43,950
I've studied on killing you.

1490
01:52:44,786 --> 01:52:47,277
I studied about it quite a bit.

1491
01:52:51,926 --> 01:52:53,723
But I don't reckon
there's no need for it

1492
01:52:53,795 --> 01:52:57,663
if all you're gonna do is
sit there in that chair.

1493
01:52:57,732 --> 01:53:00,530
You'll be dead soon enough,

1494
01:53:00,602 --> 01:53:03,196
and the world'll be shut of you.

1495
01:53:11,446 --> 01:53:14,745
You oughta not killed my little brother.

1496
01:53:17,452 --> 01:53:20,853
He ought to have had
a chance to growed up.

1497
01:53:22,690 --> 01:53:25,386
He would have had fun sometimes.

1498
01:53:59,727 --> 01:54:01,888
Little fella.

1499
01:55:10,698 --> 01:55:13,189
- (Gasps.)
- Hey!

1500
01:55:13,268 --> 01:55:16,101
What in the goddamn
hell are you doing, Karl?

1501
01:55:16,170 --> 01:55:18,035
What the fuck are you doing
up in the middle of the night?

1502
01:55:18,106 --> 01:55:21,940
- What do you want, hon?
- I wanna be baptized.

1503
01:55:22,010 --> 01:55:24,570
(Doyle.) Well, get baptized,
then. I don't give a shit.

1504
01:55:24,646 --> 01:55:28,047
Call up a fucking preacher,
goddamnit! We can't baptize you.

1505
01:55:28,116 --> 01:55:31,711
We'll call Brother Epersom. We'll go
see him tomorrow and get you baptized.

1506
01:55:31,786 --> 01:55:34,983
It's Sunday. You go on back to bed, now.

1507
01:55:36,991 --> 01:55:40,392
What are you doing
with that damn hammer?

1508
01:55:43,264 --> 01:55:47,701
I don't rightly know. I just
kinda woke up a-holdin' it.

1509
01:55:55,777 --> 01:55:57,472
What the fuck do you think
he's doing with that hammer?

1510
01:55:57,545 --> 01:55:59,706
I don't know.

1511
01:56:01,282 --> 01:56:03,273
(Sighs.)

1512
01:56:20,768 --> 01:56:25,205
Upon his profession of faith in
our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ,

1513
01:56:25,273 --> 01:56:27,833
and in obedience under his command,

1514
01:56:27,909 --> 01:56:30,139
and by the authority of the Church,

1515
01:56:30,211 --> 01:56:33,442
I indeed baptize this my brother

1516
01:56:33,514 --> 01:56:38,247
in the name of the Father, and
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

1517
01:56:41,723 --> 01:56:43,554
Amen.

1518
01:56:43,624 --> 01:56:46,491
Marie, would you sing 137, please?

1519
01:56:47,295 --> 01:56:50,856
Softly and tenderly

1520
01:56:50,932 --> 01:56:54,595
Jesus is calling

1521
01:56:54,669 --> 01:57:00,266
Calling for you and for me

1522
01:57:02,377 --> 01:57:04,538
- Hi.
- Hi.

1523
01:57:05,713 --> 01:57:08,614
- So how'd the baptizing go?
- It went real good.

1524
01:57:08,683 --> 01:57:10,844
Yeah? Good.

1525
01:57:11,786 --> 01:57:13,947
I'm kinda hungry.

1526
01:57:14,022 --> 01:57:16,650
Ain't it about time to eat?

1527
01:57:16,724 --> 01:57:20,820
You know what I got a craving
for? Some of that Chicken Champ.

1528
01:57:20,895 --> 01:57:23,489
Why don't you run down
there and get some? I'll buy.

1529
01:57:23,564 --> 01:57:27,466
- Would y'all like that?
- It sure sounds fine to me.

1530
01:57:27,535 --> 01:57:30,197
I'd have me a chicken
leg or two. Mm-hm.

1531
01:57:32,974 --> 01:57:37,240
- Get some of their coleslaw, too.
- OK. All right, y'all wanna go with me?

1532
01:57:37,311 --> 01:57:39,711
No, they don't need to go with
you. There's a ball game coming on.

1533
01:57:39,781 --> 01:57:43,842
- We'll just sit here and do man things.
- I'll be back in a little bit, then.

1534
01:57:43,918 --> 01:57:47,513
- All right. Hey, get some extra gravy.
- OK.

1535
01:57:52,193 --> 01:57:55,720
Why don't y'all sit
your asses down here?

1536
01:57:55,797 --> 01:57:57,958
Sit down.

1537
01:58:10,244 --> 01:58:16,240
I just wanted to get your momma outta the
house for a few minutes so we could talk.

1538
01:58:25,927 --> 01:58:28,327
See, here's the deal, Frank.

1539
01:58:30,932 --> 01:58:36,802
If I'm gonna throw my life away doing
what I want to come live with y'all,

1540
01:58:36,871 --> 01:58:39,704
we're gonna get some shit straight.

1541
01:58:39,774 --> 01:58:43,904
See, your mommy and I don't
have no problems except for you.

1542
01:58:43,978 --> 01:58:47,379
Fact is, we'd never have
a bad word between us.

1543
01:58:47,448 --> 01:58:49,609
But since you do exist,

1544
01:58:49,684 --> 01:58:52,551
and I'm gonna be the
head of the household,

1545
01:58:52,620 --> 01:58:55,054
then you're gonna learn
to live by my rules.

1546
01:58:55,690 --> 01:58:59,148
And the first rule is, you don't
speak unless you're spoken to.

1547
01:58:59,227 --> 01:59:01,718
You got me?

1548
01:59:01,796 --> 01:59:04,356
Now, you stay the hell outta my way.

1549
01:59:05,166 --> 01:59:07,691
And do what a regular kid does.

1550
01:59:07,768 --> 01:59:11,534
You're a weird little shit,
Frank, and I don't get you.

1551
01:59:11,606 --> 01:59:13,767
So wake up,

1552
01:59:13,841 --> 01:59:16,332
and face what they call reality.

1553
01:59:17,044 --> 01:59:21,538
See, we're gonna be a
family, Frank. My family.

1554
01:59:21,616 --> 01:59:24,210
I'll be paying all the bills,

1555
01:59:24,285 --> 01:59:27,277
so that means you're stuck with my ass.

1556
01:59:27,355 --> 01:59:30,119
But I ain't your daddy.

1557
01:59:30,191 --> 01:59:32,785
You just act like I am.

1558
01:59:32,860 --> 01:59:37,695
And the other thing I say is,
your buddy Karl here's going.

1559
01:59:38,633 --> 01:59:41,158
We can't be no normal family
with him living in the garage

1560
01:59:41,235 --> 01:59:44,261
and coming into the damn bedroom at four
in the morning carrying hammers and shit.

1561
01:59:44,338 --> 01:59:46,829
Karl can stay if he
wants to. Momma said...

1562
01:59:46,908 --> 01:59:48,671
What did I tell you about your momma?

1563
01:59:48,743 --> 01:59:53,373
Mister, don't you never lay another
hand on that boy. You understand me?

1564
01:59:53,447 --> 01:59:56,712
Let go of my goddamn hand, you retard.
Now get out there and get your shit,

1565
01:59:56,784 --> 01:59:58,945
and get out.

1566
02:00:00,955 --> 02:00:03,947
That was a wake-up call, Frankie.

1567
02:00:04,025 --> 02:00:07,358
You remember what I said
about reality, Frank.

1568
02:00:07,428 --> 02:00:09,589
Get out, retard.

1569
02:01:07,088 --> 02:01:10,854
Where are you going, Karl? Didn't
you want some chicken and things?

1570
02:01:10,925 --> 02:01:14,190
No, ma'am. I'm going off somewheres.

1571
02:01:14,262 --> 02:01:17,095
Well, OK. I got you some.

1572
02:01:17,164 --> 02:01:19,291
That Frank, he went off somewheres too,

1573
02:01:19,367 --> 02:01:21,892
so when you go in there,
he won't be indoors.

1574
02:01:21,969 --> 02:01:23,834
Where'd he go? What's going on?

1575
02:01:23,904 --> 02:01:26,668
He just wanted to go
off and play, I reckon.

1576
02:01:26,741 --> 02:01:31,474
You just go in there and eat your dinner
with that Doyle. Don't worry yourself none.

1577
02:01:31,545 --> 02:01:33,445
All right, then.

1578
02:01:33,514 --> 02:01:37,678
Well, I'll see you later. Oh, if you
see Frank, tell him to come on back home.

1579
02:01:37,752 --> 02:01:42,553
I don't get to see him all day except
Sundays. He can go play tomorrow.

1580
02:01:42,623 --> 02:01:44,784
- Ma'am?
- Yeah.

1581
02:01:48,629 --> 02:01:51,689
You're a good momma to that boy.

1582
02:01:51,766 --> 02:01:53,859
You care for him.

1583
02:01:53,934 --> 02:01:56,869
You work hard to care for him.

1584
02:01:56,937 --> 02:01:59,735
You light him up in his eyes,

1585
02:01:59,807 --> 02:02:01,798
I've seen it.

1586
02:02:02,743 --> 02:02:06,372
That boy wouldn't know
what to do without you.

1587
02:02:06,447 --> 02:02:09,075
Well, thank you, hon. That's
real good of you to say.

1588
02:02:09,150 --> 02:02:11,778
I wouldn't know what to
do without him either.

1589
02:02:11,852 --> 02:02:14,446
You've been real good to me, too.

1590
02:02:14,522 --> 02:02:19,016
It ain't everybody that'd make
biscuits in the middle of the night.

1591
02:02:19,093 --> 02:02:22,927
You and that boy has
given me a good feeling.

1592
02:02:22,997 --> 02:02:25,591
We sure like having you.

1593
02:02:25,666 --> 02:02:27,827
Thank you.

1594
02:02:29,370 --> 02:02:32,430
I'm just now getting
around to telling you,

1595
02:02:32,506 --> 02:02:36,943
but I fixed that washing machine so that
boy ain't gotta tote that laundry no more.

1596
02:02:37,011 --> 02:02:39,036
Oh, thank you.

1597
02:02:39,113 --> 02:02:41,104
Thanks.

1598
02:02:44,952 --> 02:02:47,284
You been real good to me.

1599
02:02:55,896 --> 02:02:58,160
Karl?

1600
02:03:04,305 --> 02:03:07,468
Hey, Karl. How'd you
know to come out here?

1601
02:03:07,541 --> 02:03:09,873
I knowed you'd be out here.

1602
02:03:10,845 --> 02:03:13,439
What are you doing
digging with that stub?

1603
02:03:13,514 --> 02:03:16,745
Just digging. I ain't
ever gonna be happy now.

1604
02:03:16,817 --> 02:03:20,275
Not with that son of a
bitch moving in for good.

1605
02:03:20,354 --> 02:03:23,221
I wish me and you and
Momma would just run away,

1606
02:03:23,290 --> 02:03:25,622
but she said...

1607
02:03:25,693 --> 02:03:28,093
wherever we went, he'd find us.

1608
02:03:28,162 --> 02:03:34,465
He's crazy. Sometimes I think it'd have
been better off if I wasn't even born.

1609
02:03:34,535 --> 02:03:37,436
Well, I'm glad of it you was borned.

1610
02:03:39,940 --> 02:03:43,740
I don't reckon I'm gonna be
out there in the garage no more.

1611
02:03:43,811 --> 02:03:46,507
You have to, Karl. You
have to look out for me.

1612
02:03:46,580 --> 02:03:49,344
You can't let that son
of a bitch run you off.

1613
02:03:49,417 --> 02:03:54,855
You're just a boy. You ought
not to use language like that.

1614
02:03:54,922 --> 02:03:57,447
I don't mean to say
nothing bad about you,

1615
02:03:57,525 --> 02:04:02,360
but why don't you stop Doyle
when he's being thataway?

1616
02:04:02,430 --> 02:04:06,457
You're older than him.
You're strong, too.

1617
02:04:06,534 --> 02:04:10,561
My daddy wouldn't let him
do that to me and Momma.

1618
02:04:12,339 --> 02:04:15,240
That fella's a whole
sight meaner than me.

1619
02:04:15,309 --> 02:04:17,641
He'd just whup the tar outta me.

1620
02:04:17,711 --> 02:04:19,042
Yeah.

1621
02:04:19,113 --> 02:04:21,206
I guess so.

1622
02:04:22,016 --> 02:04:24,507
I'm real tired, you know that?

1623
02:04:25,519 --> 02:04:28,920
A boy my age shouldn't
be tired of things.

1624
02:04:31,826 --> 02:04:33,987
I'm tired, too.

1625
02:04:36,831 --> 02:04:40,858
Just 'cause I ain't gonna
be around no more maybe,

1626
02:04:40,935 --> 02:04:43,495
it don't mean I don't care for you.

1627
02:04:43,571 --> 02:04:46,005
I care for you a good deal.

1628
02:04:46,073 --> 02:04:48,940
I care for you more than
anything else there is.

1629
02:04:49,009 --> 02:04:52,706
You and me made friends
right off the bat.

1630
02:04:52,780 --> 02:04:57,547
I care for you, too. But you'll
be around. Don't say that.

1631
02:04:57,618 --> 02:05:01,110
It don't make no difference
where I was to be.

1632
02:05:01,188 --> 02:05:03,179
We'll always be friends.

1633
02:05:03,257 --> 02:05:05,555
Can't nobody stop that.

1634
02:05:15,803 --> 02:05:19,034
I aim for you to have these books.

1635
02:05:19,106 --> 02:05:22,007
You don't wanna give
away all your books.

1636
02:05:22,076 --> 02:05:24,408
I aim for you to have 'em.

1637
02:05:32,987 --> 02:05:37,151
Maybe you can make a little
more sense outta 'em than I can.

1638
02:05:37,224 --> 02:05:43,220
I made you a little old book marker and
put it in there in that book on Christmas.

1639
02:05:44,265 --> 02:05:46,028
Man.

1640
02:05:46,100 --> 02:05:48,091
Thanks.

1641
02:05:49,837 --> 02:05:53,500
You know when you get a
feeling and you don't know why?

1642
02:05:53,574 --> 02:05:56,168
Yes, sir.

1643
02:05:56,243 --> 02:05:58,575
I got a feeling today.

1644
02:05:59,780 --> 02:06:02,078
Reckon what kind of a feeling?

1645
02:06:02,983 --> 02:06:06,384
Like something different. I don't know.

1646
02:06:08,923 --> 02:06:11,721
You're leaving, ain't you, Karl?

1647
02:06:20,935 --> 02:06:24,427
Would you do something for
me if was to I ask you to?

1648
02:06:24,505 --> 02:06:27,497
You know I would. Whatever you want.

1649
02:06:30,210 --> 02:06:32,405
When you leave outta here tonight,

1650
02:06:32,479 --> 02:06:37,109
I don't want you going over
and staying with that Doyle.

1651
02:06:38,819 --> 02:06:43,688
He's got it out for you
tonight. I got me a feeling, too.

1652
02:06:43,757 --> 02:06:47,591
You oughta not be over there when
he's all liquored up and mean thataway.

1653
02:06:47,661 --> 02:06:49,720
Your momma neither.

1654
02:06:50,664 --> 02:06:55,158
When you get up from here to leave, I
want you to go over to that fella's house.

1655
02:06:55,235 --> 02:06:57,396
Your momma's friend.

1656
02:07:00,240 --> 02:07:03,300
I want you to give me your word on it.

1657
02:07:03,377 --> 02:07:06,073
OK. I give you my word on it.

1658
02:07:07,881 --> 02:07:11,578
Is everything gonna be
OK? Are you all right?

1659
02:07:15,889 --> 02:07:19,586
Yeah, everything's
gonna be all right, boy.

1660
02:07:27,067 --> 02:07:29,695
I kinda wanna put my arm
around you for a minute,

1661
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:33,171
then I'm gonna get up
and leave outta here.

1662
02:07:33,240 --> 02:07:35,231
OK.

1663
02:08:01,201 --> 02:08:03,533
I love you, boy.

1664
02:08:05,673 --> 02:08:08,005
I love you, too.

1665
02:08:11,378 --> 02:08:13,539
All right, then.

1666
02:08:29,296 --> 02:08:30,627
Karl?

1667
02:08:54,188 --> 02:08:56,679
Karl, what are you doing
here? You want to come in?

1668
02:08:56,757 --> 02:09:01,160
I ain't a-stayin'. I need
to ask you for a favor.

1669
02:09:01,228 --> 02:09:03,355
OK.

1670
02:09:03,430 --> 02:09:06,888
This evening, I want you to
go get that Miss Wheatley,

1671
02:09:06,967 --> 02:09:11,063
let her and that Frank stay
over here with you tonight.

1672
02:09:11,138 --> 02:09:13,629
What's... What's wrong?
Is everything all right?

1673
02:09:13,674 --> 02:09:15,938
That Doyle.

1674
02:09:16,009 --> 02:09:20,673
He's in a bad way again with that
drinking and a-bein' mean to folks.

1675
02:09:20,748 --> 02:09:22,682
I want you to give me
your word you'll do it.

1676
02:09:22,750 --> 02:09:26,242
Well, sure, OK. Has... has...
He hasn't hurt them, has he?

1677
02:09:26,320 --> 02:09:28,311
No, sir, not yet.

1678
02:09:29,923 --> 02:09:31,413
Here.

1679
02:09:31,492 --> 02:09:33,858
I want you to give that
to that Miss Wheatley.

1680
02:09:33,927 --> 02:09:35,918
It ain't much.

1681
02:09:35,996 --> 02:09:39,329
But there might be a little
something there to help out.

1682
02:09:39,399 --> 02:09:44,735
It's what I made a-fixin' lawn
mowers and whatnot for Bill Cox.

1683
02:09:44,805 --> 02:09:47,797
Well, how about you, Karl?
You want to stay here?

1684
02:09:49,276 --> 02:09:54,680
I don't reckon that you have to go
with women to be a good daddy to a boy.

1685
02:09:54,748 --> 02:09:57,979
You been real square-dealing with me.

1686
02:09:58,919 --> 02:10:02,377
Bible says two men ought
not to lay together.

1687
02:10:03,457 --> 02:10:09,123
But I'll bet you the good Lord
wouldn't send nobody like you to Hades.

1688
02:10:10,597 --> 02:10:12,963
That boy, Frank,

1689
02:10:14,067 --> 02:10:17,332
he lives inside of his own heart.

1690
02:10:17,404 --> 02:10:20,202
That's a awful big place to live in.

1691
02:10:22,276 --> 02:10:24,608
You take care of that boy.

1692
02:10:28,382 --> 02:10:31,146
I will.

1693
02:10:37,424 --> 02:10:39,415
Karl?

1694
02:15:00,253 --> 02:15:02,585
Where's everybody else?

1695
02:15:09,896 --> 02:15:12,057
You seen 'em?

1696
02:15:19,139 --> 02:15:22,404
Didn't I tell you to
get moved outta here?

1697
02:15:25,912 --> 02:15:30,042
How does a fella go about
getting hold of the police?

1698
02:15:35,755 --> 02:15:38,553
You use the fucking phone, I guess.

1699
02:15:40,026 --> 02:15:42,460
Which numbers do you put in?

1700
02:15:50,470 --> 02:15:53,166
Can't you see I'm trying to relax?

1701
02:15:55,642 --> 02:15:59,874
I thought I told you to get
outta here, leave me alone.

1702
02:16:04,718 --> 02:16:08,210
What in the hell you doing
with that lawn mower blade?

1703
02:16:08,288 --> 02:16:10,620
I aim to kill you with it.

1704
02:16:24,237 --> 02:16:27,297
Well, to call the police, you push:

1705
02:16:27,374 --> 02:16:31,834

9-1-1.

1706
02:16:37,017 --> 02:16:40,180
You best tell 'em to bring an ambulance.

1707
02:16:42,856 --> 02:16:45,916
Or a hearse, if you're going to kill me.

1708
02:16:59,739 --> 02:17:01,730
Karl!

1709
02:17:45,885 --> 02:17:48,183
Yes, ma'am.

1710
02:17:48,255 --> 02:17:52,589
I need the police sent over here
to the Wheatley house. Mm-hm.

1711
02:17:54,361 --> 02:17:58,593
I've killed Doyle Hargraves
with a lawn mower blade.

1712
02:17:59,666 --> 02:18:02,965
Yes, ma'am. I'm right sure of it.

1713
02:18:03,970 --> 02:18:06,564
I hit him two good whacks with it.

1714
02:18:06,640 --> 02:18:10,667
That second 'un just plumb
near cut his head in two.

1715
02:18:14,247 --> 02:18:20,243
It's a little old white house on the
corner of Vine Street and some other street.

1716
02:18:21,354 --> 02:18:26,951
There's a truck out front says
"Doyle Hargraves Construction" on it.

1717
02:18:29,296 --> 02:18:32,265
Oh, I'll be sitting here waiting on you.

1718
02:18:33,266 --> 02:18:36,929
Doyle said, besides sending the police,

1719
02:18:37,003 --> 02:18:40,939
you might want to send
a ambulance or a hearse.

1720
02:18:43,310 --> 02:18:45,301
Thank you.

1721
02:19:48,775 --> 02:19:50,333
So.

1722
02:19:51,344 --> 02:19:54,108
Now... on the third day,

1723
02:19:55,315 --> 02:19:56,839
I, uh...

1724
02:19:56,916 --> 02:20:00,477
I washed her, 'cause she
wasn't too clean, you know?

1725
02:20:00,553 --> 02:20:03,488
Well, I got all the right spots.

1726
02:20:03,556 --> 02:20:06,821
She was the first one I ever kept for any
length of time, 'cause I get bored real easy.

1727
02:20:06,893 --> 02:20:10,294
I got a real short
attention span, you know.

1728
02:20:10,363 --> 02:20:11,853
Yeah.

1729
02:20:11,931 --> 02:20:16,925
I mean, I can't say that
she enjoyed her stay.

1730
02:20:20,206 --> 02:20:22,106
But that washcloth I put in her mouth,

1731
02:20:22,175 --> 02:20:24,837
I held in place with a
real fat piece of duct tape,

1732
02:20:24,911 --> 02:20:26,640
kept all her complaining
down to a minimum.

1733
02:20:26,713 --> 02:20:31,514
I don't really like people, you know, who talk
all the time. I like to do all the talking.

1734
02:20:31,584 --> 02:20:34,781
That's why I think I'm so fond of you.

1735
02:20:34,854 --> 02:20:38,415
'Cause you're just so
easy-going, you know?

1736
02:20:40,627 --> 02:20:45,155
Although I do sense a little
tension in you, time to time.

1737
02:20:48,101 --> 02:20:50,695
So you were out in the world, huh?

1738
02:20:52,705 --> 02:20:56,539
Did you have fun? Did you
make any acquaintances?

1739
02:20:56,609 --> 02:21:00,136
There was a boy. We made friends.

1740
02:21:00,213 --> 02:21:02,204
Yeah, I'll bet you did.

1741
02:21:05,718 --> 02:21:10,382
I mean, I was never bent that way.
I was bent the other way, you know.

1742
02:21:11,391 --> 02:21:13,382
So.

1743
02:21:14,794 --> 02:21:17,957
What was it like out there in the world?

1744
02:21:20,867 --> 02:21:23,529
It was too big.

1745
02:21:23,603 --> 02:21:24,865
Ah.

1746
02:21:25,872 --> 02:21:29,239
Well, it's not too big
in here, is it? Huh?

1747
02:21:29,309 --> 02:21:31,300
Huh?

1748
02:21:36,249 --> 02:21:38,240
You know something?

1749
02:21:39,285 --> 02:21:44,689
I feel real, uh, real generous
today. I feel like listening.

1750
02:21:46,025 --> 02:21:48,823
And I'll bet you got plenty to tell.

1751
02:21:50,597 --> 02:21:52,588
Karl?

1752
02:21:54,501 --> 02:21:56,492
Who'd you kill?

1753
02:21:58,104 --> 02:22:00,504
Was it the boy?

1754
02:22:00,573 --> 02:22:03,542
Don't you say nothing about that boy.

1755
02:22:09,949 --> 02:22:14,511
Fact of business, don't
you say another word to me.

1756
02:22:14,587 --> 02:22:17,181
I ain't listening to you no more.

1757
02:22:32,438 --> 02:22:35,430
Yeah, shh.

1758
02:22:40,947 --> 02:22:42,938
(Scraping.)

1759
02:24:05,198 --> 02:24:07,792
("The Maker" by Daniel Lanois.)

1760
02:24:20,613 --> 02:24:22,604
Oh

1761
02:24:24,417 --> 02:24:27,875
Oh, deep water

1762
02:24:31,724 --> 02:24:35,820
Black and cold

1763
02:24:35,895 --> 02:24:38,728
Like the night

1764
02:24:42,468 --> 02:24:46,928
I stand with arms wide open

1765
02:24:47,974 --> 02:24:52,206
I've run a twisted line

1766
02:24:53,446 --> 02:24:56,142
I'm a stranger

1767
02:24:56,215 --> 02:25:01,175
In the eyes of the maker

1768
02:25:10,263 --> 02:25:13,391
I could not see

1769
02:25:14,367 --> 02:25:18,201
For the fog in my eyes

1770
02:25:21,474 --> 02:25:24,272
I could not feel

1771
02:25:25,511 --> 02:25:28,878
For the fear in my life

1772
02:25:32,318 --> 02:25:37,688
And from across the great divide

1773
02:25:37,757 --> 02:25:43,093
In the distance I saw light

1774
02:25:43,162 --> 02:25:45,926
Jean Baptiste

1775
02:25:45,998 --> 02:25:50,901
Walking to me with the maker

1776
02:25:54,741 --> 02:25:57,767
My body

1777
02:25:58,945 --> 02:26:02,904
Is bent and broken

1778
02:26:05,718 --> 02:26:08,915
By long

1779
02:26:10,089 --> 02:26:14,082
And dangerous sleep

1780
02:26:16,696 --> 02:26:21,395
I can't work the fields of Abraham

1781
02:26:22,401 --> 02:26:26,599
And turn my head away

1782
02:26:27,573 --> 02:26:30,406
I'm not a stranger

1783
02:26:30,476 --> 02:26:35,880
In the hands of the maker

1784
02:26:44,757 --> 02:26:47,248
Brother John

1785
02:26:48,895 --> 02:26:52,888
Have you seen the homeless daughters?

1786
02:26:56,035 --> 02:26:58,697
Standing there

1787
02:27:00,039 --> 02:27:03,907
With broken wings

1788
02:27:06,646 --> 02:27:09,581
I have seen

1789
02:27:09,649 --> 02:27:12,777
Flaming swords

1790
02:27:12,852 --> 02:27:17,414
There over east of Eden

1791
02:27:18,491 --> 02:27:22,188
Burning in the eyes

1792
02:27:22,261 --> 02:27:25,924
Of the maker

1793
02:27:29,569 --> 02:27:33,335
Burning in the eyes

1794
02:27:33,406 --> 02:27:36,773
Of the maker
