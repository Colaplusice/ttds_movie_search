1
00:02:00,163 --> 00:02:05,251
- Allora, come stai, Leone?
- Bene

2
00:02:08,171 --> 00:02:12,675
Okay, okay. Let's talk business.

3
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:17,347
This fat bastard is trying to move
in on Morizio's business.

4
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,599
And you know, Morizio
is a reasonable guy.

5
00:02:19,682 --> 00:02:23,985
He just wants
a little conversation.

6
00:02:24,020 --> 00:02:26,856
But this guy,
he don't wanna hear about it.

7
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:28,775
Maybe he'll listen to you.

8
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:32,862
He comes to town every Tuesday.
Are you free Tuesday?

9
00:02:34,948 --> 00:02:36,950
Yeah, I'm free Tuesday.

10
00:02:53,299 --> 00:02:55,718
Nice to see you again,
Mr Jones.

11
00:03:09,816 --> 00:03:11,818
Remember, neatness counts.

12
00:03:11,901 --> 00:03:14,362
You got one half hour.

13
00:03:21,745 --> 00:03:24,247
One hour.

14
00:03:35,175 --> 00:03:36,676
Yeah, what?

15
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,848
It's Tonto, downstairs.
There's a guy who wants to talk to you.

16
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:45,268
What's he look like?

17
00:03:47,687 --> 00:03:49,856
Serious.

18
00:03:49,939 --> 00:03:53,026
- Tell him I'm coming up.
- He's coming up.

19
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:59,199
Somebody's coming up.
Somebody serious.

20
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:06,956
Mickey, open your eyes.
We got company.

21
00:04:09,375 --> 00:04:11,294
We got company.

22
00:04:23,723 --> 00:04:25,141
Come on.

23
00:04:33,900 --> 00:04:35,318
Stop, stop, man!

24
00:04:45,912 --> 00:04:48,832
Tell the driver to wait for us
out back, and hurry up.

25
00:05:35,962 --> 00:05:39,048
- Hey sweetie, what's going on?
- Don't worry, baby.

26
00:05:39,132 --> 00:05:41,217
It's cool. Take a nap.

27
00:05:59,486 --> 00:06:01,905
Oh, my God.

28
00:06:01,988 --> 00:06:04,115
Those fuckers blocked
both the exits.

29
00:06:08,328 --> 00:06:09,746
Check the terrace!

30
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:25,989
- 911 emergency.
- I need help.

31
00:07:26,072 --> 00:07:28,408
- Somebody's trying to kill me.
- Alright, just stay on the line.

32
00:07:28,491 --> 00:07:31,161
I'll just be off a moment.

33
00:07:31,244 --> 00:07:33,663
Sir, I'm gonna connect you
with an officer.

34
00:07:51,848 --> 00:07:55,185
Detective Jefferson.
May I help you?

35
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,187
I'll call you back.

36
00:08:00,857 --> 00:08:05,528
Relax, man. I got half of Bolivia
sitting in them suitcases over here.

37
00:08:05,612 --> 00:08:09,365
Ain't been cut yet. Go ahead, take it.
It's yours.

38
00:08:13,787 --> 00:08:16,206
Dial this number.

39
00:08:28,968 --> 00:08:32,055
I'll talk to you later,
sweetie, okay?

40
00:08:33,223 --> 00:08:35,141
Bye.

41
00:08:38,978 --> 00:08:41,898
- Hello?
- It's Morizio. Remember me?

42
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:46,569
- I see you're back in town.
- Yeah. No, I mean, no.

43
00:08:46,653 --> 00:08:48,571
Just for today.

44
00:08:48,655 --> 00:08:51,408
Aha, so it's safe to say
today's your last day in town...

45
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,244
and we'll never see
your fat fucking face again.

46
00:08:54,327 --> 00:08:56,913
Yeah. Right.

47
00:08:56,996 --> 00:08:59,749
Let me speak
to our mutual friend.

48
00:09:01,668 --> 00:09:03,837
He wants to talk to you.

49
00:09:09,175 --> 00:09:13,263
Make sure he understands,
and let him go.

50
00:09:21,688 --> 00:09:25,608
Do you understand?

51
00:09:25,692 --> 00:09:28,361
- So say it.
- I understand.

52
00:09:30,363 --> 00:09:31,823
Good.

53
00:09:57,891 --> 00:09:59,309
Jesus.

54
00:10:08,234 --> 00:10:11,821
Hola! Qu tal amigo? Two milk as usual, eh?

55
00:11:21,808 --> 00:11:23,476
Why did you hide the cigarette?

56
00:11:25,145 --> 00:11:27,397
This building's full of rats.

57
00:11:27,439 --> 00:11:31,735
I didn't want my old man to find out.
Got enough problems.

58
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,162
What happened?

59
00:11:43,663 --> 00:11:46,791
I fell off my bike.

60
00:11:58,845 --> 00:12:02,265
Don't tell my dad
about the cigarette, okay?

61
00:12:13,359 --> 00:12:17,197
- Why are you doing this to us?
- I don't know-

62
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:20,533
People got memory problems these days.
It must be the sun.

63
00:12:20,617 --> 00:12:22,952
- Know when to come out of the sun.
- I don't know how it happened.

64
00:12:23,036 --> 00:12:25,121
What's my job? I'm just a holder.

65
00:12:25,205 --> 00:12:27,957
I hold the stuff you give to me.
I don't look at it, I don't touch it.

66
00:12:28,041 --> 00:12:30,126
- I don't even know how to cut it.
- Try to follow me, alright?

67
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,796
In June, we gave you the dope.
It tests 100 percent pure.

68
00:12:32,879 --> 00:12:36,466
Now it's July, we pick up the dope,
and it tests 90 percent pure.

69
00:12:36,549 --> 00:12:40,136
Somewhere between June and July,
ten percent turned to cut!

70
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:43,473
I don't know. It's none of my business.
You give me the stuff, I hold it.

71
00:12:43,508 --> 00:12:46,976
- That's all I know.
- You know I'm trying to help you out here...

72
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,729
but if you're gonna be
a hard-ass about it...

73
00:12:49,813 --> 00:12:52,148
I gotta disturb him.

74
00:12:52,232 --> 00:12:57,487
When he's into his music,
he hates being disturbed.

75
00:12:57,570 --> 00:12:59,823
I'm telling you the truth.

76
00:12:59,906 --> 00:13:04,160
I hope so, because he's got a talent
for sniffing out a lie.

77
00:13:04,244 --> 00:13:06,079
It's scary.

78
00:13:06,162 --> 00:13:09,249
It's almost like a sixth sense.

79
00:13:09,332 --> 00:13:13,169
Are you gonna change your tune
or I gotta bust into his?

80
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,841
I'm telling you the truth.

81
00:13:25,432 --> 00:13:26,850
All right.

82
00:13:29,602 --> 00:13:31,187
Stan.

83
00:13:34,607 --> 00:13:38,278
I'm sorry.
He said he didn't cut the dope.

84
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,571
Of course he didn't.

85
00:14:30,997 --> 00:14:32,749
Just do me a favor.

86
00:14:32,832 --> 00:14:35,585
Find out who did by tomorrow.

87
00:14:35,668 --> 00:14:37,420
Noon.

88
00:14:49,015 --> 00:14:51,601
Malky, wait.

89
00:14:51,684 --> 00:14:54,687
I didn't cut your shit.

90
00:14:54,771 --> 00:14:57,273
Find out yourself!

91
00:15:00,693 --> 00:15:03,696
What are you doing out here?
Get inside and do your homework.

92
00:15:03,731 --> 00:15:06,366
- I did it already.
- Get inside and help your sister...

93
00:15:06,449 --> 00:15:07,951
clean up the goddamn house!

94
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:10,120
And stop smoking cigarettes!

95
00:16:59,813 --> 00:17:01,064
One!

96
00:17:02,482 --> 00:17:04,567
Two. Take a deep breath in.

97
00:17:04,651 --> 00:17:06,736
Take a deep breath out.

98
00:17:06,820 --> 00:17:10,824
- Take a deep breath. Inhale.
- Time's up. My turn.

99
00:17:10,907 --> 00:17:13,660
Change the channel,
and I'll smash your face.

100
00:17:13,743 --> 00:17:16,162
Ready for the legs.
And down.

101
00:17:27,841 --> 00:17:29,926
Sorry, sweetheart.

102
00:17:30,009 --> 00:17:32,094
Squeeze. Release.

103
00:17:32,129 --> 00:17:34,197
Good morning.

104
00:17:34,232 --> 00:17:36,266
Hi, honey.

105
00:17:38,017 --> 00:17:41,771
Sweetheart, turn that down.
Mama's got a headache.

106
00:17:41,855 --> 00:17:45,024
- She took my turn.
- She wants to watch goddamn cartoons!

107
00:17:45,108 --> 00:17:47,110
It wouldn't hurt her
to move her ass.

108
00:17:47,193 --> 00:17:49,195
I'm not the one
with a fat ass around here.

109
00:17:49,230 --> 00:17:51,496
Two and up.

110
00:17:51,531 --> 00:17:54,033
Can someone who's doing nothing
all day but watching cartoons...

111
00:17:54,068 --> 00:17:56,619
move a little ass
and go get some food?

112
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:01,207
- Legs. Beautiful.
- I dare you to say that again.

113
00:18:05,962 --> 00:18:09,716
- Margie, I think I screwed up.
- It wouldn't be the first time.

114
00:18:09,751 --> 00:18:13,219
You always come up
with something, right?

115
00:18:13,254 --> 00:18:15,520
I think I went too far this time.

116
00:18:15,555 --> 00:18:19,058
You're going too far right now.
I'm gonna be late for work.

117
00:18:19,093 --> 00:18:21,561
How about working
at home today?

118
00:18:23,313 --> 00:18:27,400
Really feel it.
That's it, stomach in.

119
00:18:27,435 --> 00:18:30,987
- One-
- Now it's my turn!

120
00:18:31,071 --> 00:18:33,656
Shit!
She's gonna hit me!

121
00:18:33,740 --> 00:18:36,159
- Daddy, she's-
- Shit! Shut the goddamn door!

122
00:18:37,660 --> 00:18:39,496
Please don't shoot!

123
00:18:41,414 --> 00:18:43,833
Fucking bitch.

124
00:18:43,917 --> 00:18:48,713
- Megatron!
- Firm up the whole body.

125
00:18:48,755 --> 00:18:52,842
When you use the Quadra-Step,
your thigh muscles-

126
00:18:52,926 --> 00:18:55,929
- Can somebody answer the phone?
- I'm busy!

127
00:19:02,435 --> 00:19:04,903
- Hello?
- This is Marguerite McCallister...

128
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:09,442
headmistress at the Spencer School
in Wildwood, New Jersey.

129
00:19:09,526 --> 00:19:12,195
Is Mr. or Mrs. Lando home?

130
00:19:15,115 --> 00:19:17,200
This is she.

131
00:19:17,283 --> 00:19:20,620
Mrs. Lando, when your husband
enrolled Mathilda at Spencer...

132
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:22,956
he told us she had problems

133
00:19:22,997 --> 00:19:25,583
As you know, we pride ourselves
on turning troubled girls...

134
00:19:25,625 --> 00:19:27,794
into healthy,
productive young women.

135
00:19:27,836 --> 00:19:30,985
But if they are not here,
there is very little we can do.

136
00:19:31,020 --> 00:19:34,078
Mathilda left school
without permission nearly two weeks ago.

137
00:19:34,113 --> 00:19:37,102
I know your husband paid tuition
in advance for a year...

138
00:19:37,137 --> 00:19:41,182
but if you will refer to the rules
and regulations manual we sent you...

139
00:19:41,217 --> 00:19:45,228
you will see that unless there is
a valid excuse for prolonged absence...

140
00:19:45,270 --> 00:19:48,273
your tuition will be forfeit.

141
00:19:48,314 --> 00:19:50,900
She's dead.

142
00:20:10,837 --> 00:20:14,841
Tell that fucking kid to do
a little work around here!

143
00:20:14,924 --> 00:20:19,179
Clean up!
I'm tired of this fucking mess.

144
00:20:19,214 --> 00:20:20,680
Hurry up!

145
00:20:34,110 --> 00:20:36,237
Why am I feeling

146
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:38,281
When things could look black

147
00:20:38,323 --> 00:20:42,619
That nothing
could possibly go wrong

148
00:20:43,661 --> 00:20:48,708
This has been
A most unusual day

149
00:20:49,876 --> 00:20:52,879
Love has made me see things

150
00:20:52,962 --> 00:20:58,885
In a different way

151
00:21:26,496 --> 00:21:30,667
Is life always this hard,
or is it just when you're a kid?

152
00:21:34,129 --> 00:21:36,089
Always like this.

153
00:21:42,846 --> 00:21:44,180
Keep it.

154
00:21:52,272 --> 00:21:56,192
I'm going grocery shopping.
You want some milk?

155
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:59,154
One quart or two?
It's two, right?

156
00:23:42,298 --> 00:23:46,553
I like these calm little moments
before the storm.

157
00:23:47,887 --> 00:23:50,223
It reminds me of Beethoven.

158
00:23:55,645 --> 00:23:58,815
Can you hear it?

159
00:23:58,898 --> 00:24:02,736
It's like when you put your head
to the grass...

160
00:24:02,819 --> 00:24:04,988
you can hear it growing.

161
00:24:05,071 --> 00:24:07,824
You can hear the insects.

162
00:24:13,496 --> 00:24:16,416
- Do you like Beethoven?
- Couldn't really say.

163
00:24:16,499 --> 00:24:18,501
I'm gonna play you some.

164
00:24:22,505 --> 00:24:23,923
Daddy!

165
00:24:35,435 --> 00:24:37,353
You better stay here.

166
00:25:19,145 --> 00:25:21,064
We said noon.

167
00:25:24,567 --> 00:25:26,569
I've got one minute past.

168
00:25:30,490 --> 00:25:32,575
You don't like Beethoven.

169
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,044
You don't know
what you're missing.

170
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:40,583
Overtures like that
get my juices flowing.

171
00:25:40,667 --> 00:25:43,253
So powerful.

172
00:25:43,336 --> 00:25:47,507
But after his openings,
to be honest...

173
00:25:47,590 --> 00:25:51,678
he does tend to get
a little fucking boring.

174
00:25:53,847 --> 00:25:55,932
That's why I stopped!

175
00:26:00,270 --> 00:26:02,605
Toss the apartment.

176
00:26:23,293 --> 00:26:27,046
You're a Mozart fan.
I love him too.

177
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:30,133
I love Mozart!

178
00:26:35,305 --> 00:26:37,724
He was Austrian, you know.

179
00:26:37,807 --> 00:26:41,561
But for this kind of work,
he's a little bit light.

180
00:26:41,644 --> 00:26:44,647
So I tend to go
for the heavier guys.

181
00:26:44,731 --> 00:26:48,318
- Cool.
- Dude, what the fuck are you doing?

182
00:26:48,401 --> 00:26:51,154
Man,
keep your bombacut mouth shut.

183
00:26:51,237 --> 00:26:55,123
Check out Brahms.
He's good too.

184
00:26:55,158 --> 00:26:57,744
- What the fuck do you know about music?
- Man, knock it off!

185
00:27:12,592 --> 00:27:15,428
- You check the mattress?
- Nope.

186
00:27:57,387 --> 00:27:58,888
Wow.

187
00:28:18,658 --> 00:28:21,327
Oh! Fuck!

188
00:28:21,411 --> 00:28:23,747
He's dead.

189
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:28,084
Jesus. Look what you did.

190
00:28:28,168 --> 00:28:30,086
Stan, you all right?

191
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,442
What are you doing?

192
00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:56,613
- He's dead!
- But he ruined my suit.

193
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:59,199
Yeah, I know,
but he's dead.

194
00:28:59,282 --> 00:29:02,619
He's a piece of meat.
Forget about it. Calm down.

195
00:29:02,702 --> 00:29:04,287
I'm calm.

196
00:29:04,370 --> 00:29:06,539
Stay there, all right?

197
00:29:09,876 --> 00:29:12,378
Benny!

198
00:29:15,131 --> 00:29:20,220
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!
It's Malky and Stan!

199
00:29:21,721 --> 00:29:23,890
Take it easy, all right?

200
00:29:23,973 --> 00:29:25,725
Come on.

201
00:29:29,562 --> 00:29:31,564
Come on,
let's get a cigarette.

202
00:29:31,599 --> 00:29:34,067
Benny, we're coming out!

203
00:29:34,150 --> 00:29:36,903
Benny, don't fire!

204
00:29:36,986 --> 00:29:39,823
Get in there!

205
00:29:39,906 --> 00:29:42,325
Jesus fucking Christ, Benny!

206
00:29:42,409 --> 00:29:45,995
You wear something new and-
Got a light?

207
00:29:46,030 --> 00:29:48,081
Take it easy.

208
00:29:49,249 --> 00:29:51,216
What's happening out there?

209
00:29:51,251 --> 00:29:53,169
It's all right, ma'am.
D. E. A. Police.

210
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,339
Leave that poor family alone.

211
00:29:56,423 --> 00:30:00,093
- Everything's all right. Just calm down.
- I am calm. I'm calm.

212
00:30:00,176 --> 00:30:02,429
Why don't you
leave them alone?

213
00:30:03,847 --> 00:30:06,933
He said go back inside.

214
00:30:11,688 --> 00:30:14,441
Stan, I think it's better
if we go inside.

215
00:30:32,125 --> 00:30:37,380
Benny, turn that kitchen upside down!
Find that shit!

216
00:30:37,464 --> 00:30:41,217
Willy Blood, look what you did!
You killed a 4-year-old kid!

217
00:30:41,301 --> 00:30:43,136
Did you really
have to do that?

218
00:30:58,985 --> 00:31:01,654
Please open the door.

219
00:31:57,794 --> 00:32:01,297
Benny,
there are three kids here.

220
00:32:01,381 --> 00:32:03,716
I think Stan killed this girl.

221
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:06,386
Willy, that asshole,
shot the little boy.

222
00:32:06,469 --> 00:32:08,972
The third one's missing.
Find her.

223
00:32:18,148 --> 00:32:20,900
Shit. We missed
the little girl, man.

224
00:32:20,984 --> 00:32:24,571
I'm gonna find the fucking super
in this goddamn building.

225
00:32:50,096 --> 00:32:55,435
- Don't you recognize me?
- Me, Grimlock. Know you!

226
00:33:05,528 --> 00:33:06,946
Shit.

227
00:33:08,281 --> 00:33:12,285
- Yo! I found it!
- Bingo!

228
00:33:12,368 --> 00:33:15,371
- They found it.
- I know.

229
00:33:15,455 --> 00:33:17,457
There it is.

230
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:20,460
There's cops outside.
We better go.

231
00:33:20,543 --> 00:33:23,963
It's the cops outside.
We better go. You stay here.

232
00:33:26,049 --> 00:33:27,467
What do I say?

233
00:33:39,729 --> 00:33:41,481
Tell them...

234
00:33:41,564 --> 00:33:45,819
we were doing our job.

235
00:33:55,495 --> 00:33:59,416
- What's your name?
- Mathilda.

236
00:34:05,088 --> 00:34:07,590
- Sorry about your father.
- If somebody didn't do it...

237
00:34:07,674 --> 00:34:10,677
one day or another,
I would have probably done it myself.

238
00:34:12,679 --> 00:34:14,180
Your mother, she-

239
00:34:14,264 --> 00:34:15,932
She's not my mother.

240
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:21,604
My sister wanted to lose some weight.
Bet she never looked better.

241
00:34:21,688 --> 00:34:24,607
She's not even my real sister.
Just a half sister.

242
00:34:24,691 --> 00:34:27,026
Not a good half at that.

243
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:39,372
If you couldn't stand them,
why are you crying?

244
00:34:39,407 --> 00:34:42,340
They killed my brother.

245
00:34:42,375 --> 00:34:46,713
What the hell did he do?
He was four years old.

246
00:34:46,748 --> 00:34:48,680
He never used to cry.

247
00:34:48,715 --> 00:34:52,719
He just used to sit
next to me and cuddle.

248
00:34:52,886 --> 00:34:57,724
I was more of a mother to him
than that goddamned pig ever was.

249
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:02,228
Don't talk like that about pigs.
They're usually nicer than people.

250
00:35:02,312 --> 00:35:04,564
But they smell like shit.

251
00:35:06,399 --> 00:35:07,901
Not true.

252
00:35:07,984 --> 00:35:12,572
As a matter of fact,
right now I have one in my kitchen...

253
00:35:12,655 --> 00:35:14,491
that's very clean...

254
00:35:14,574 --> 00:35:18,745
- and smells very nice.
- You don't have a pig in your kitchen.

255
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:22,213
Yes, I do.

256
00:35:22,248 --> 00:35:25,502
I was just in there,
and I didn't see any goddamned pig.

257
00:35:25,585 --> 00:35:29,005
Don't move.
I'll get him.

258
00:35:30,924 --> 00:35:32,926
Piggy, where are you?

259
00:35:34,511 --> 00:35:36,429
There you are.

260
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:46,356
Hi, Mathilda.

261
00:35:46,391 --> 00:35:49,192
Hi, piggy.

262
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:59,869
How are you today?

263
00:35:59,953 --> 00:36:02,455
I've seen better days.

264
00:36:09,671 --> 00:36:14,467
- What's your name?
- Leon.

265
00:36:16,886 --> 00:36:18,972
Cute name.

266
00:36:25,895 --> 00:36:29,983
You have anyone to go to,
any family anyplace else?

267
00:36:41,202 --> 00:36:43,538
I'm gonna get some more milk.

268
00:37:02,265 --> 00:37:03,767
Holy shit.

269
00:37:09,773 --> 00:37:13,693
Don't touch that, please.

270
00:37:13,777 --> 00:37:16,154
What do you do for a living?

271
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,740
Cleaner.

272
00:37:20,116 --> 00:37:22,035
You're a hit man?

273
00:37:25,705 --> 00:37:27,123
Cool.

274
00:37:39,719 --> 00:37:43,556
- Do you clean anyone?
- No women, no kids. That's the rules.

275
00:37:43,591 --> 00:37:47,394
How much would it cost to hire someone
to get those dirt bags...

276
00:37:47,435 --> 00:37:50,236
who killed my brother?

277
00:37:50,271 --> 00:37:54,067
- Five grand a head.
- Wow.

278
00:37:54,150 --> 00:37:58,238
How about I work for you...

279
00:37:58,321 --> 00:38:01,825
and in exchange,
you teach me how to clean?

280
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:04,911
What do you think?

281
00:38:04,994 --> 00:38:07,080
I'll clean your place.
I'll do the shopping.

282
00:38:07,115 --> 00:38:09,332
I'll even wash your clothes.

283
00:38:10,625 --> 00:38:15,004
- Is it a deal?
- No, it's not a deal.

284
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:27,308
What do you want me to do?
I've got no place to go.

285
00:38:27,434 --> 00:38:31,229
You've had a rough day today.

286
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:36,693
Go to sleep,
and we'll see tomorrow.

287
00:38:51,124 --> 00:38:54,294
You've been really great
with me, Leon...

288
00:38:54,377 --> 00:38:57,380
and it's not always like that.

289
00:38:57,415 --> 00:38:59,299
You know?

290
00:39:07,057 --> 00:39:08,475
Good night.

291
00:40:24,801 --> 00:40:27,137
You sleep well?

292
00:40:27,172 --> 00:40:29,472
Good.

293
00:40:29,556 --> 00:40:31,975
- After breakfast you gotta take off.
- Where to?

294
00:40:32,058 --> 00:40:34,728
Not my problem.

295
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,577
Read it.

296
00:40:57,459 --> 00:40:59,502
You don't know how to read.

297
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:02,505
I'm learning, but I've had
a lot of work lately...

298
00:41:02,589 --> 00:41:05,592
so I'm a little behind.

299
00:41:05,675 --> 00:41:07,177
What's it say?

300
00:41:07,260 --> 00:41:11,264
I've decided what to do with my life.
I wanna be a cleaner.

301
00:41:11,347 --> 00:41:15,852
You wanna be a cleaner.
Here.

302
00:41:15,935 --> 00:41:20,648
Take it. It's a good-bye gift.
Go clean, but not with me.

303
00:41:20,774 --> 00:41:24,360
- I work alone. Understand?
- Bonnie and Clyde didn't work alone.

304
00:41:24,444 --> 00:41:27,447
Thelma and Louise didn't work alone.
They were the best.

305
00:41:29,616 --> 00:41:33,703
Mathilda, why are you
doing this to me?

306
00:41:33,787 --> 00:41:36,456
I've been nothing
but nice to you.

307
00:41:36,539 --> 00:41:39,417
I saved your life yesterday,
right outside the door.

308
00:41:39,459 --> 00:41:42,712
Right.
Now you're responsible for it.

309
00:41:42,796 --> 00:41:46,216
If you saved my life,
you must've saved it for a good reason.

310
00:41:46,299 --> 00:41:49,052
If you throw me out now,
it's like you never opened your door...

311
00:41:49,135 --> 00:41:51,971
like you let me die
right there in front of it.

312
00:41:52,055 --> 00:41:57,477
But you did open it. So-

313
00:42:00,730 --> 00:42:05,068
If you don't help me,
I'll die tonight. I can feel it.

314
00:42:05,151 --> 00:42:07,404
I don't wanna die tonight.

315
00:42:09,989 --> 00:42:12,409
You're just a little girl.

316
00:42:12,534 --> 00:42:15,412
Don't take it badly,
but I don't think you could do it.

317
00:42:15,495 --> 00:42:16,955
I'm sorry.

318
00:42:35,724 --> 00:42:37,600
How's that?

319
00:43:11,551 --> 00:43:14,637
Don't you ever do that again
or I'll break your head.

320
00:43:14,721 --> 00:43:16,139
You got that?

321
00:43:17,390 --> 00:43:20,810
I don't work like that.
It's not professional.

322
00:43:20,894 --> 00:43:22,812
There is rules.

323
00:43:23,938 --> 00:43:26,649
And stop saying okay
all the time!

324
00:43:29,694 --> 00:43:31,321
Good.

325
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:48,838
You expect to use that
in this hotel?

326
00:43:50,799 --> 00:43:53,843
Mister, I have to use it...

327
00:43:53,927 --> 00:43:58,014
because I have an audition
at Juilliard next month...

328
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:00,350
and I have to practice.

329
00:44:00,433 --> 00:44:04,270
Okay, but not after 10:00.

330
00:44:04,354 --> 00:44:06,356
- I promise.
- All right.

331
00:44:08,441 --> 00:44:11,403
I'll put you
at the end of the hall...

332
00:44:11,444 --> 00:44:15,532
so that you
don't disturb anyone.

333
00:44:15,573 --> 00:44:17,117
Fill those out, please.

334
00:44:21,287 --> 00:44:26,292
Daddy, can I please fill them out?
I like to check in to hotels.

335
00:44:29,879 --> 00:44:32,048
Thanks, Pop.
I'll bring these back in a minute.

336
00:44:32,132 --> 00:44:34,384
Fourth floor!

337
00:44:34,467 --> 00:44:36,017
Thanks, mister!

338
00:44:36,052 --> 00:44:39,222
You're lucky to have a little girl
that's interested in things.

339
00:44:41,641 --> 00:44:45,019
I have a kid, 17,
does nothing all day long.

340
00:44:50,650 --> 00:44:53,737
Can I leave my plant here
while I take my stuff upstairs?

341
00:44:53,820 --> 00:44:55,572
Of course.

342
00:45:16,551 --> 00:45:19,763
I'm putting in a name of a girl
in my class who makes me sick.

343
00:45:22,307 --> 00:45:25,852
If things get hot,
she'll take the heat.

344
00:45:42,869 --> 00:45:45,497
There. Finished.

345
00:45:45,955 --> 00:45:49,042
- How old are you?
- Eighteen.

346
00:45:49,876 --> 00:45:52,796
- Eighteen?
- Want to see my license?

347
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:58,134
No. You just look a little young.

348
00:45:58,968 --> 00:46:00,637
Thanks.

349
00:46:07,811 --> 00:46:11,398
Leon, I want you to teach me
how to be like you.

350
00:46:11,481 --> 00:46:13,733
I want to be strong and smart
like you.

351
00:46:15,485 --> 00:46:18,321
I know I'm not
strong enough yet...

352
00:46:18,405 --> 00:46:22,492
but I could learn the basics,
the theory.

353
00:46:22,527 --> 00:46:26,663
What do you think?
Just the theory.

354
00:46:26,746 --> 00:46:28,998
I need this, Leon.

355
00:46:30,667 --> 00:46:32,836
I need time
to get my head together.

356
00:46:32,871 --> 00:46:35,672
Yeah, and I need...

357
00:46:41,428 --> 00:46:42,929
a drink.

358
00:46:43,012 --> 00:46:46,015
Don't move.
I'll go get one.

359
00:47:11,124 --> 00:47:14,544
When you told me
to get this baby out for you...

360
00:47:14,627 --> 00:47:16,880
I thought my hearing was going.

361
00:47:16,963 --> 00:47:21,885
I says to myself, Leon's a pro.
Nobody uses that except beginners

362
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,720
I like to stay in shape.

363
00:47:23,803 --> 00:47:28,224
Sure.
Always stay on top of it.

364
00:47:28,308 --> 00:47:31,978
It's like me. I gotta know
where everything is all the time.

365
00:47:32,062 --> 00:47:34,564
I never leave this place,
except to go from here to there.

366
00:47:37,984 --> 00:47:41,071
Change ain't good, Leon.
You know?

367
00:47:51,998 --> 00:47:53,416
Check it.

368
00:47:55,001 --> 00:47:57,587
- Make sure it's the right thing.
- I trust you.

369
00:47:57,670 --> 00:48:00,757
One thing's got nothing to do
with the other. Remember that.

370
00:48:02,175 --> 00:48:04,094
I will.

371
00:48:19,192 --> 00:48:22,112
The rifle is the first weapon
you learn how to use...

372
00:48:22,195 --> 00:48:26,032
because it lets you
keep your distance from the client.

373
00:48:26,067 --> 00:48:28,284
The closer you get
to being a pro...

374
00:48:28,368 --> 00:48:31,621
the closer you can get
to the client.

375
00:48:31,704 --> 00:48:35,125
The knife, for example,
is the last thing you learn.

376
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:42,298
Position.

377
00:49:06,489 --> 00:49:10,326
Never take it off until the last minute.
It reflects light.

378
00:49:10,410 --> 00:49:13,163
They can see you coming
from a mile away.

379
00:49:13,246 --> 00:49:17,000
And always dress down.

380
00:49:17,083 --> 00:49:20,170
Never brighter
than the floor, okay?

381
00:49:23,089 --> 00:49:27,677
Let's practice now.
It's the best way to learn.

382
00:49:27,761 --> 00:49:29,846
Who should I hit?

383
00:49:29,929 --> 00:49:31,514
Whoever.

384
00:49:38,438 --> 00:49:40,690
I'll be with you in a second.
Give me a few minutes. Thank you.

385
00:49:40,774 --> 00:49:43,526
You guys get lost.
I don't want to see you.

386
00:49:43,610 --> 00:49:47,113
- Is everyone in position?
- This has to look natural.

387
00:49:56,623 --> 00:50:00,043
- No women, no kids. Right?
- Right.

388
00:50:07,300 --> 00:50:09,719
Jogger in the yellow and orange?

389
00:50:14,307 --> 00:50:16,726
Keep calm.

390
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:23,566
Don't take your eyes off him.

391
00:50:23,650 --> 00:50:25,402
Breathe easy.

392
00:50:27,153 --> 00:50:28,822
Watch his movement.

393
00:50:31,324 --> 00:50:33,743
Pretend you're running with him.

394
00:50:36,830 --> 00:50:39,916
Try to feel his next movement.

395
00:50:41,501 --> 00:50:44,838
Take a deep breath.
Hold it.

396
00:50:53,430 --> 00:50:54,848
Now.

397
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:56,766
Oh, my God!

398
00:50:56,850 --> 00:51:00,520
- I'm all right. I'm fine.
- Get down! Where'd that come from?

399
00:51:00,603 --> 00:51:04,357
One shot. Not bad, huh?

400
00:51:04,441 --> 00:51:06,860
- Who the hell fired?
- I just can't breathe! Get off me.

401
00:51:06,943 --> 00:51:10,613
Can we try
with real bullets now?

402
00:51:10,697 --> 00:51:12,699
Not today.
Let's pack up.

403
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:23,460
Like that.

404
00:52:05,835 --> 00:52:09,172
- No, thanks.
- No discussion.

405
00:52:50,964 --> 00:52:52,882
It seemed...

406
00:52:54,300 --> 00:52:56,219
to Socrates-

407
00:53:04,060 --> 00:53:05,979
I'll do it.

408
00:53:19,993 --> 00:53:22,412
Leon, all we do is work.

409
00:53:22,495 --> 00:53:25,665
We need a break.
Let's play a game.

410
00:53:25,749 --> 00:53:29,419
- What kind of game?
- I have this great game.

411
00:53:29,502 --> 00:53:33,339
It makes you think and helps your
memory. It's exactly what you need.

412
00:53:46,686 --> 00:53:48,271
Like a virgin

413
00:53:50,190 --> 00:53:53,443
Touched for the very first time

414
00:53:57,864 --> 00:54:01,034
- Who is it?
- I don't know.

415
00:54:11,211 --> 00:54:16,966
Happy birthday to you

416
00:54:17,050 --> 00:54:21,304
Happy birthday, Mr. President

417
00:54:21,388 --> 00:54:23,807
I don't know.

418
00:54:32,649 --> 00:54:34,484
Moustache.

419
00:54:38,488 --> 00:54:41,991
I'm singing in the rain

420
00:54:42,075 --> 00:54:44,661
Just singing in the rain

421
00:54:44,744 --> 00:54:47,247
- What a beaut-
- Gene Kelly?

422
00:54:48,915 --> 00:54:50,333
Good.

423
00:54:50,417 --> 00:54:53,253
Your turn now.

424
00:54:58,758 --> 00:55:00,510
Okay, pilgrim.

425
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:05,348
Clint Eastwood?

426
00:55:12,272 --> 00:55:17,360
- I don't know. I give up.
- John Wayne.

427
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:21,448
I was just about to say that.
I swear. It's amazing.

428
00:55:21,483 --> 00:55:23,867
Leon, really brilliant.

429
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:28,204
Amazing.

430
00:55:43,136 --> 00:55:47,390
- You love your plant, don't you?
- It's my best friend.

431
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:51,061
Always happy.
No questions.

432
00:55:52,645 --> 00:55:55,732
It's like me, you see.

433
00:55:55,815 --> 00:55:57,984
No roots.

434
00:55:58,068 --> 00:56:01,821
If you really love it, you should
plant it in a park so it can have roots.

435
00:56:05,909 --> 00:56:08,495
You should be watering me
if you want me to grow.

436
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,248
You're right.

437
00:56:23,676 --> 00:56:25,095
Wait!

438
00:56:39,943 --> 00:56:44,531
They gotta be jumping out of the plate.
They gotta be alive.

439
00:56:52,622 --> 00:56:54,958
It's been a long time, Leon.

440
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:02,882
I missed you.

441
00:57:02,966 --> 00:57:07,721
- And you missed some nice jobs too.
- Been training.

442
00:57:07,804 --> 00:57:11,808
Training's good,
but don't overdo it.

443
00:57:11,891 --> 00:57:14,310
Training don't pay
as good as working, Leon.

444
00:57:14,394 --> 00:57:15,812
Tony...

445
00:57:18,732 --> 00:57:23,403
all the money I make,
that you keep for me-

446
00:57:23,486 --> 00:57:25,488
You need some money?

447
00:57:25,523 --> 00:57:27,073
Just curious.

448
00:57:27,157 --> 00:57:29,075
I've been working
a long time...

449
00:57:29,159 --> 00:57:32,829
and I haven't done anything
with my money.

450
00:57:34,998 --> 00:57:40,754
I thought maybe
someday I could use it.

451
00:57:40,837 --> 00:57:43,173
You met a woman.

452
00:57:52,766 --> 00:57:54,851
You gotta be careful
with women.

453
00:57:54,934 --> 00:57:57,937
Remember when you arrived
in this country?

454
00:57:58,021 --> 00:58:02,358
When I took you in, you were still wet
behind the fucking ears...

455
00:58:02,442 --> 00:58:05,361
and, already, you were in deep shit
because of a woman.

456
00:58:05,445 --> 00:58:10,366
- Don't forget that, Leon.
- I wish I could sometimes.

457
00:58:12,952 --> 00:58:15,205
You know, about my money-

458
00:58:15,288 --> 00:58:19,709
Maybe I could give...

459
00:58:19,793 --> 00:58:21,878
a little...

460
00:58:23,380 --> 00:58:25,715
to someone.

461
00:58:25,799 --> 00:58:28,885
You know, to help out.

462
00:58:31,388 --> 00:58:35,475
It's your money. I'm just
holding it for you, like a bank.

463
00:58:35,558 --> 00:58:39,896
Except better than a bank
because banks always get knocked off.

464
00:58:39,979 --> 00:58:42,315
No one knocks off old Tony.

465
00:58:42,399 --> 00:58:44,901
Besides, with a bank...

466
00:58:44,984 --> 00:58:48,238
there's always tons of forms
and all that shit.

467
00:58:48,321 --> 00:58:53,410
But old Tony, nothing to read,
nothing to write. It's all in his head.

468
00:58:54,744 --> 00:58:58,081
I know how to read now.

469
00:58:58,164 --> 00:59:01,251
That's good, Leon.

470
00:59:04,170 --> 00:59:05,755
Your money's here.

471
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,556
Whenever you want it,
you just ask me.

472
00:59:08,591 --> 00:59:12,679
- Here's a grand. Come on.
- It's okay. I don't need it.

473
00:59:12,762 --> 00:59:17,183
- Take it. Have some fun. Go ahead.
- Thank you.

474
00:59:17,267 --> 00:59:21,187
All right.
Now let's talk business.

475
00:59:21,271 --> 00:59:24,774
Don't move.
I'll go get the file.

476
00:59:24,858 --> 00:59:28,945
Manolo, a glass of milk
for my friend Leon here.

477
00:59:52,218 --> 00:59:54,686
Listen, Mathilda,
you gotta be careful.

478
00:59:54,721 --> 00:59:57,307
You can't just speak
to any guy off the street.

479
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:01,311
Leon, get a grip.
What's the big fucking deal?

480
01:00:01,394 --> 01:00:04,147
I was just smoking a butt
while I was waiting.

481
01:00:05,899 --> 01:00:08,151
I want you to stop cursing.

482
01:00:08,234 --> 01:00:10,487
You can't talk to people
like that all the time.

483
01:00:10,570 --> 01:00:13,656
I want you to make an effort
to talk nice.

484
01:00:18,411 --> 01:00:21,664
And I want you to stop smoking.
It will kill you.

485
01:00:28,254 --> 01:00:31,007
Stay away from him.
He looks like a weirdo.

486
01:00:36,096 --> 01:00:39,849
I'll be out in five minutes.
Stand where I can see you.

487
01:00:53,279 --> 01:00:57,534
Leon, I think I'm kinda
falling in love with you.

488
01:01:00,036 --> 01:01:03,373
It's the first time for me,
you know.

489
01:01:03,456 --> 01:01:06,793
How do you know it's love
if you've never been in love before?

490
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:09,796
'Cause I feel it.

491
01:01:09,831 --> 01:01:11,381
Where?

492
01:01:14,968 --> 01:01:16,970
In my stomach.

493
01:01:19,889 --> 01:01:23,309
It's all warm.

494
01:01:23,393 --> 01:01:28,648
I always had a knot there,
and now it's gone.

495
01:01:31,568 --> 01:01:36,740
Mathilda, I'm glad you
don't have a stomachache anymore.

496
01:01:36,823 --> 01:01:39,325
I don't think
it means anything.

497
01:01:39,409 --> 01:01:43,329
I'm late for work.
I hate being late for work.

498
01:02:27,707 --> 01:02:29,709
How's the practicing going?

499
01:02:59,656 --> 01:03:04,744
- How are we today, miss?
- A little sick of practicing.

500
01:03:04,828 --> 01:03:06,746
I understand.

501
01:03:06,830 --> 01:03:08,748
But you're doing all right.

502
01:03:08,832 --> 01:03:10,834
I haven't received
any complaints.

503
01:03:10,917 --> 01:03:15,171
I put a cloth over the strings
to lessen the noise.

504
01:03:16,256 --> 01:03:17,841
That's very smart.

505
01:03:17,924 --> 01:03:22,512
- Not everyone loves music.
- I know.

506
01:03:22,595 --> 01:03:24,764
What does your father do?

507
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:30,603
- He's a composer.
- That's wonderful.

508
01:03:30,687 --> 01:03:33,273
Except he's not really my father.

509
01:03:38,862 --> 01:03:40,613
He's my lover.

510
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:47,954
Think I'll go for a walk.

511
01:04:02,719 --> 01:04:06,306
- What are you doing Saturday night?
- What about dinner?

512
01:04:06,389 --> 01:04:09,476
- Where you going?
- Visiting friends at 6J.

513
01:04:09,559 --> 01:04:11,394
Go ahead.
What about Saturday?

514
01:04:11,478 --> 01:04:15,398
- About 8:00?
- I don't know.

515
01:04:15,482 --> 01:04:19,652
You got plans?

516
01:04:24,991 --> 01:04:26,910
Meet you here?

517
01:05:41,901 --> 01:05:44,487
We know you're a busy man.
We'll make this short.

518
01:05:44,571 --> 01:05:48,408
If you'll just take us step-by-step
through exactly what happened.

519
01:05:49,492 --> 01:05:52,412
The guy was here.
He went for his gun.

520
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:54,664
Bang, we shot him.

521
01:05:57,917 --> 01:06:00,670
- Where exactly were the kids?
- I don't know!

522
01:06:00,705 --> 01:06:03,423
They should have been at school,
don't you think?

523
01:06:03,506 --> 01:06:05,425
Your statement said
you were the first man in.

524
01:06:05,508 --> 01:06:07,594
- Didn't you see any kids?
- The door was broken.

525
01:06:07,629 --> 01:06:09,679
What happened?
Did you follow the procedure?

526
01:06:11,765 --> 01:06:15,351
I lost a good man here.
What the fuck do you want with me?

527
01:06:15,435 --> 01:06:17,854
Cooperation.

528
01:06:21,274 --> 01:06:25,195
I haven't got time
for this Mickey Mouse bullshit!

529
01:06:25,278 --> 01:06:29,949
You want cooperation?
Come up in my office, room 4602.

530
01:06:40,960 --> 01:06:43,129
Kids should be at school.

531
01:06:44,381 --> 01:06:46,883
Come on, that's my ball!

532
01:06:46,966 --> 01:06:51,471
Give that back.
Where you going?

533
01:06:51,554 --> 01:06:54,974
Damn! Where you going, man?
That's my ball!

534
01:07:01,731 --> 01:07:03,650
Follow the blue car.

535
01:07:03,733 --> 01:07:06,903
You want me to blast the music
and go through the lights?

536
01:07:06,986 --> 01:07:08,488
No, drive slowly.

537
01:07:08,571 --> 01:07:11,408
Take the hundred bucks,
and shut the fuck up.

538
01:07:44,607 --> 01:07:48,111
I do not want to fight you,
but you leave me no choice.

539
01:07:50,196 --> 01:07:54,451
Boy, you just gave me
a great idea!

540
01:07:58,455 --> 01:08:01,624
- I mean a big one!
- Welcome back to E! News Daily...

541
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:04,794
our 30-minute look at the latest
in entertainment news.

542
01:08:04,878 --> 01:08:06,796
I'm Bianca Ferrar.

543
01:08:11,468 --> 01:08:14,471
It's for you.
A present.

544
01:08:16,723 --> 01:08:20,226
Do you want me to open it?
I'll open it.

545
01:08:25,231 --> 01:08:28,902
How do you like it?
Nice, eh?

546
01:08:28,937 --> 01:08:30,904
Mr. McGuffin?

547
01:08:33,323 --> 01:08:35,909
Can I have a word with you?

548
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,409
Here. It's for a contract.
Twenty grand, right?

549
01:09:59,492 --> 01:10:02,495
His name is Norman Stansfield,
and he's in room 4602...

550
01:10:02,530 --> 01:10:05,582
in the D. E. A. building,
26 Federal Plaza.

551
01:10:06,499 --> 01:10:09,002
- I'm not taking it.
- Why not?

552
01:10:09,919 --> 01:10:11,838
- It's too heavy.
- Well.

553
01:10:12,005 --> 01:10:13,840
Will you rent me your gear
for the day?

554
01:10:13,923 --> 01:10:16,509
I never lend out my gear.

555
01:10:16,593 --> 01:10:18,428
But...

556
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:20,513
you still have your gun.
Use it.

557
01:10:20,597 --> 01:10:24,017
Just do me a favor.
Don't shoot out the window.

558
01:10:24,100 --> 01:10:26,519
Why are you so mean to me?

559
01:10:28,104 --> 01:10:30,607
Wildly killing people
you don't give a shit about...

560
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:34,444
but you won't get the bastards
that killed my whole family?

561
01:10:35,028 --> 01:10:37,947
Revenge is not good
once you're done. Believe.

562
01:10:38,615 --> 01:10:41,249
- It's better to forget.
- Forget?

563
01:10:41,284 --> 01:10:44,287
After I've seen the outline
of my brother's body on the floor...

564
01:10:44,371 --> 01:10:46,373
you expect me to forget?

565
01:10:46,456 --> 01:10:48,625
I want to kill
those sons of bitches.

566
01:10:48,660 --> 01:10:50,460
Blow their fucking heads off.

567
01:10:50,543 --> 01:10:53,546
Nothing's the same
after you've killed someone.

568
01:10:55,632 --> 01:10:58,551
Your life is changed forever.

569
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:04,140
You have to sleep with one eye open
for the rest of your life.

570
01:11:04,175 --> 01:11:06,893
I don't give a shit
about sleeping, Leon.

571
01:11:07,811 --> 01:11:09,896
I want love...

572
01:11:10,146 --> 01:11:12,148
or death.

573
01:11:13,066 --> 01:11:14,651
That's it.

574
01:11:16,403 --> 01:11:18,655
I want death.

575
01:11:19,155 --> 01:11:22,492
Get off my case, Mathilda.
I'm tired of your games.

576
01:11:26,246 --> 01:11:28,415
There's this really great game, Leon.

577
01:11:28,498 --> 01:11:32,001
Makes people nicer.
Starts them thinking.

578
01:11:36,256 --> 01:11:38,717
The kind of game you love.

579
01:11:51,104 --> 01:11:52,939
If I win...

580
01:11:53,898 --> 01:11:56,860
you keep me with you...
for life.

581
01:11:59,028 --> 01:12:00,655
And if you lose?

582
01:12:00,697 --> 01:12:04,200
Go shopping alone, like before.

583
01:12:06,202 --> 01:12:08,705
You're gonna lose, Mathilda.

584
01:12:10,373 --> 01:12:13,168
There's a round in the chamber.
I heard it.

585
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:14,627
So what?

586
01:12:14,711 --> 01:12:17,714
What's it to you if I end up
with a bullet in the head?

587
01:12:20,467 --> 01:12:22,010
Nothing.

588
01:12:25,889 --> 01:12:28,141
I hope you're not lying, Leon.

589
01:12:29,392 --> 01:12:32,729
I really hope that deep down inside
there's no love in you.

590
01:12:35,815 --> 01:12:37,817
Because if there is...

591
01:12:37,901 --> 01:12:41,154
just a little bit of love in there
for me...

592
01:12:43,573 --> 01:12:46,659
I think that in a few minutes
you'll regret you never said anything.

593
01:12:56,461 --> 01:12:58,505
I love you, Leon.

594
01:13:15,605 --> 01:13:16,940
I win.

595
01:13:34,499 --> 01:13:36,876
I took a hit.

596
01:13:37,627 --> 01:13:40,046
I need a hand now.

597
01:13:40,130 --> 01:13:44,217
I know she's young,
but she learns fast.

598
01:13:44,342 --> 01:13:46,469
Kids need to be shaped
into something, right?

599
01:13:46,511 --> 01:13:49,806
I know. I taught you that.
But ain't there an age limit?

600
01:13:49,889 --> 01:13:51,808
She's 18.

601
01:13:51,891 --> 01:13:53,768
Really?

602
01:13:57,564 --> 01:13:59,315
How about something to drink, Tony?

603
01:13:59,399 --> 01:14:02,902
Sure. Manolo, glass of milk
for Leon.

604
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:07,365
Nice tattoo.

605
01:14:12,037 --> 01:14:15,498
Manolo, make that two.

606
01:14:34,976 --> 01:14:37,854
- What's that for?
- Can't afford to catch cold.

607
01:14:38,855 --> 01:14:40,857
First you find out
where the chain is.

608
01:14:40,940 --> 01:14:44,319
You can't see it,
but you can feel it. Here.

609
01:14:44,360 --> 01:14:47,113
- I'll ring, you start talking.
- What do I say?

610
01:14:48,114 --> 01:14:49,866
Whatever you want.

611
01:14:51,951 --> 01:14:53,870
- Yes?
- Hi.

612
01:14:53,953 --> 01:14:55,872
It's Susan.

613
01:14:55,955 --> 01:14:59,209
I'm sorry. You must have
the wrong door, little girl.

614
01:14:59,292 --> 01:15:01,628
I don't know any Susan.

615
01:15:01,711 --> 01:15:05,715
Move back a little.
I can't see anything.

616
01:15:05,799 --> 01:15:08,468
The light's out.

617
01:15:08,551 --> 01:15:10,428
It's all dark out here.

618
01:15:13,723 --> 01:15:18,228
- Mister, I'm scared.
- Okay.

619
01:15:22,899 --> 01:15:25,652
What the fuck are you doing?

620
01:15:30,824 --> 01:15:32,158
Open up.

621
01:15:33,993 --> 01:15:37,038
If it leaves your mouth,
I'll pull the trigger, capisce?

622
01:16:14,534 --> 01:16:16,786
Here's okay.
Let it go.

623
01:16:16,870 --> 01:16:19,289
I said, Let it go.

624
01:16:19,372 --> 01:16:21,791
Move. Move over.

625
01:16:23,293 --> 01:16:24,759
Easy. Easy.

626
01:16:24,794 --> 01:16:27,797
Easy. Careful.
You want me-

627
01:16:29,299 --> 01:16:32,135
Go ahead. Your turn.

628
01:16:39,059 --> 01:16:41,478
Help me.
Please don't beat me.

629
01:16:41,561 --> 01:16:44,064
Sir?

630
01:16:47,233 --> 01:16:49,235
Sir, it's not my dope.

631
01:16:49,319 --> 01:16:51,321
Sir, look I-

632
01:16:51,404 --> 01:16:53,239
A little left, please.

633
01:16:56,785 --> 01:16:58,328
Before- Ple-

634
01:17:00,997 --> 01:17:03,917
Now, the security shot.

635
01:17:08,755 --> 01:17:11,883
No, the second goes
higher on the chest.

636
01:17:12,008 --> 01:17:14,344
Aim for the heart and lungs.

637
01:17:14,427 --> 01:17:16,429
There. Right there.
You see?

638
01:17:16,554 --> 01:17:18,431
The first shot takes him
out of order.

639
01:17:18,515 --> 01:17:21,434
- The second finishes him off.
- What are you fucking doing?

640
01:17:21,518 --> 01:17:22,936
Never in the face.

641
01:17:23,019 --> 01:17:26,272
If they can't recognize the client,
you don't get paid.

642
01:17:26,356 --> 01:17:30,026
You could take out anybody
and said you did the job.

643
01:17:30,110 --> 01:17:32,779
- Got it?
- Got it. Never in the face.

644
01:17:32,862 --> 01:17:36,366
- Now you can put the tools away.
- What are you fucking doing?

645
01:17:36,408 --> 01:17:38,702
What the fuck is going on?
Hey, mister!

646
01:17:38,785 --> 01:17:41,287
What are you fucking-

647
01:17:44,374 --> 01:17:46,834
You see, when you use
the silencer a lot...

648
01:17:46,869 --> 01:17:49,295
you have to put
a piece of cloth here...

649
01:17:49,421 --> 01:17:52,298
because it gets very hot
and could burn it inside.

650
01:17:52,382 --> 01:17:55,051
A damp, black cloth is the best.

651
01:17:58,471 --> 01:18:00,390
What you doing?

652
01:18:00,473 --> 01:18:03,727
We said no women, no kids.

653
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:07,480
Who do you think this is gonna kill,
junkies and monkeys?

654
01:18:23,079 --> 01:18:25,373
Now it's clean.

655
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:29,252
Let's get out of here.

656
01:18:42,682 --> 01:18:44,642
I thought we don't have
the right to drink.

657
01:18:44,684 --> 01:18:48,813
I know, but we're making
an exception for your first time.

658
01:18:50,940 --> 01:18:56,279
Well, if we're making exceptions
for a job well-done...

659
01:18:56,362 --> 01:19:00,200
how about a kiss,
like in the movies?

660
01:19:03,870 --> 01:19:05,789
Yes.

661
01:19:06,873 --> 01:19:08,625
What you doing?

662
01:19:08,666 --> 01:19:11,127
- I'm going to kiss you.
- I want you to stop, please.

663
01:19:11,252 --> 01:19:14,012
Come on. Just a kiss.

664
01:19:14,047 --> 01:19:17,384
Stop. Everyone is watching us.

665
01:19:19,386 --> 01:19:22,305
Go sit down.

666
01:19:29,521 --> 01:19:31,398
Enjoy.

667
01:19:36,986 --> 01:19:39,913
- You don't believe me, do you?
- How's that?

668
01:19:39,948 --> 01:19:44,994
- When I say I'm in love with you.
- Mathilda, please drop it.

669
01:19:45,078 --> 01:19:48,873
- Just change the subject, okay?
- Okay. Sorry.

670
01:19:50,166 --> 01:19:54,170
So, how old were you
when you made your first hit?

671
01:19:54,254 --> 01:19:56,840
Nineteen.

672
01:19:56,923 --> 01:19:58,842
Beat you.

673
01:21:03,364 --> 01:21:07,744
- What you doing?
- Can't afford to catch a cold.

674
01:21:54,457 --> 01:21:58,294
- There's no doorbell.
- So knock on the door.

675
01:22:01,965 --> 01:22:04,968
- Yes?
- Hi.

676
01:22:05,427 --> 01:22:07,387
I'm looking
for Mr. Reuben's apartment...

677
01:22:07,470 --> 01:22:11,224
but it's all dark out here
in the hall, and I'm lost.

678
01:22:11,307 --> 01:22:13,226
Just a second.

679
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:28,658
You want more? Come on.
Show your fucking face.

680
01:22:28,742 --> 01:22:31,494
You think you're going to
get me that easily?

681
01:22:35,999 --> 01:22:39,419
When it's tough like this,
you know it's gonna be ugly.

682
01:22:39,502 --> 01:22:43,590
Better make it quick or else
we'll be all day listening to his crap.

683
01:22:43,673 --> 01:22:46,426
Asshole! Come on, show me
your fucking face, faggot!

684
01:22:46,551 --> 01:22:48,845
- Come on, gum trick.
- Hey.

685
01:22:50,096 --> 01:22:52,432
What about the ring trick?
You know that one?

686
01:22:52,515 --> 01:22:54,934
Ring trick? Come on, asshole.
I'm waiting.

687
01:22:55,018 --> 01:22:57,020
Show it to me, motherfucker.

688
01:23:06,029 --> 01:23:08,990
That's the ring trick.

689
01:23:22,796 --> 01:23:26,883
Mario, go back to the barbershop.
We'll finish later.

690
01:23:38,061 --> 01:23:41,356
Leon, what's up?
All done already?

691
01:23:44,150 --> 01:23:47,153
Nicer than people, eh?

692
01:23:47,237 --> 01:23:49,197
I told you that.

693
01:23:51,408 --> 01:23:53,326
You got a problem?

694
01:23:56,246 --> 01:23:58,248
Get the chair. Sit down.

695
01:24:03,420 --> 01:24:07,382
I was thinking.

696
01:24:10,051 --> 01:24:13,680
If something happens
to me someday-

697
01:24:13,722 --> 01:24:17,600
Hey, Leon,
nothing's gonna happen to you.

698
01:24:17,684 --> 01:24:20,603
You're indestructible. Bullets
slide off you. You play with 'em.

699
01:24:20,687 --> 01:24:24,858
Tony, I thought about my money.

700
01:24:28,111 --> 01:24:33,616
You remember the girl
who came here the other day?

701
01:24:38,121 --> 01:24:42,959
Her name is Mathilda.

702
01:24:43,043 --> 01:24:46,379
If anything happens to me...

703
01:24:46,463 --> 01:24:50,550
I'd like you...

704
01:24:52,135 --> 01:24:54,554
to give her...

705
01:24:56,222 --> 01:24:58,892
my money.

706
01:25:01,227 --> 01:25:03,813
You can count on me, Leon.

707
01:25:03,897 --> 01:25:06,316
Thank you, Tony.

708
01:25:09,736 --> 01:25:11,571
I won't be long.

709
01:25:13,073 --> 01:25:15,992
- Did I do something wrong?
- No.

710
01:25:17,160 --> 01:25:20,080
This one is too big.

711
01:25:20,872 --> 01:25:24,250
Yeah, and I only get the leftovers,
is that it?

712
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:28,358
Mathilda, since I met you...

713
01:25:28,393 --> 01:25:30,590
everything's been different.

714
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:35,261
So I just need some time alone.

715
01:25:38,014 --> 01:25:40,016
You need some time
to grow up a little.

716
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,811
I finished growing up, Leon.

717
01:25:42,852 --> 01:25:44,687
I just get older.

718
01:25:44,771 --> 01:25:48,274
For me it's the opposite.
I'm old enough.

719
01:25:49,943 --> 01:25:52,028
I need time to grow up.

720
01:26:07,043 --> 01:26:09,129
Shit.

721
01:27:24,204 --> 01:27:26,581
Come on! Hustle!

722
01:27:28,666 --> 01:27:30,460
- Good shot.
- Come on.

723
01:27:33,797 --> 01:27:36,383
You're new, aren't you?
Fifth floor, right?

724
01:27:36,800 --> 01:27:39,386
- You can't sit here like that.
- Really, why not?

725
01:27:39,469 --> 01:27:42,221
Nothing's free.
Like a parking meter.

726
01:27:42,256 --> 01:27:44,974
When you stop, you pay.
It's the law.

727
01:27:45,141 --> 01:27:47,143
- Only on T. V.
- What'd you say?

728
01:27:47,310 --> 01:27:50,814
- Forget it. How much is your meter?
- Ten dollars...

729
01:27:50,897 --> 01:27:52,482
a month.

730
01:27:54,776 --> 01:27:56,653
Got change?

731
01:27:58,154 --> 01:28:00,448
Don't worry about it.
We'll do ten for twelve.

732
01:28:00,490 --> 01:28:02,742
I'll pay now for
the rest of the year.

733
01:28:02,826 --> 01:28:04,327
Okay, a year.

734
01:28:05,161 --> 01:28:08,289
Does paying rent here mean
I have to put up with you guys?

735
01:28:11,459 --> 01:28:14,003
So go play somewhere else.

736
01:28:17,340 --> 01:28:19,718
I need to think.

737
01:29:16,608 --> 01:29:19,819
Stand up.
Don't you like your job?

738
01:29:29,829 --> 01:29:31,247
Food.

739
01:29:34,834 --> 01:29:39,506
- Where you going?
- Special delivery, room 4602.

740
01:29:39,589 --> 01:29:41,257
Sign here.

741
01:29:41,341 --> 01:29:42,842
Come here.

742
01:29:45,512 --> 01:29:49,599
- Have a nice weekend, girls.
- Thanks.

743
01:29:49,682 --> 01:29:51,601
I'm gonna go
to the restroom.

744
01:31:11,264 --> 01:31:13,600
Special delivery?

745
01:31:13,683 --> 01:31:15,685
Let me guess.

746
01:31:17,854 --> 01:31:19,272
Chinese?

747
01:31:22,233 --> 01:31:24,444
Thai, maybe?

748
01:31:27,113 --> 01:31:29,949
I've got it.

749
01:31:30,033 --> 01:31:32,202
Italian food.

750
01:31:48,885 --> 01:31:50,804
What's your name, angel?

751
01:32:20,834 --> 01:32:24,003
I want you to put the sack
on the floor.

752
01:32:29,509 --> 01:32:30,927
Good.

753
01:32:33,513 --> 01:32:38,601
Now I want you to tell me everything
you know about Italian food.

754
01:32:38,685 --> 01:32:41,604
Don't forget the name of the chef
who fixed it for me.

755
01:32:41,688 --> 01:32:46,276
Nobody sent me.
I do business for myself.

756
01:32:48,695 --> 01:32:50,697
So this is something...

757
01:32:52,532 --> 01:32:55,035
personal, is it?

758
01:32:58,955 --> 01:33:03,126
What filthy piece of shit...

759
01:33:03,209 --> 01:33:05,128
did I do now?

760
01:33:05,211 --> 01:33:08,465
You killed my brother.

761
01:33:12,385 --> 01:33:14,304
I'm sorry.

762
01:33:22,729 --> 01:33:25,315
And you wanna join him?

763
01:33:29,319 --> 01:33:32,989
It's always the same thing.

764
01:33:37,410 --> 01:33:42,248
It's when you start to become
really afraid of death...

765
01:33:42,332 --> 01:33:45,835
that you learn
to appreciate life.

766
01:33:45,919 --> 01:33:50,340
Do you like life,
sweetheart?

767
01:33:57,263 --> 01:33:58,598
That's good.

768
01:34:03,603 --> 01:34:07,524
Because I take no pleasure...

769
01:34:08,858 --> 01:34:12,243
in taking a life...

770
01:34:12,278 --> 01:34:17,283
if it's from a person
who doesn't care about it.

771
01:34:27,711 --> 01:34:30,296
Stan, I've been looking
all over for you.

772
01:34:30,380 --> 01:34:33,633
- I checked upstairs-
- What? I'm busy.

773
01:34:33,717 --> 01:34:36,553
It's Malky, man.
He's dead.

774
01:34:38,805 --> 01:34:41,975
Malky was making a buy for us
from the Chinaman.

775
01:34:42,058 --> 01:34:44,943
But they got nothing
to do with it.

776
01:34:44,978 --> 01:34:50,900
They told me this guy came
from the outside. He was a pro.

777
01:34:50,984 --> 01:34:54,070
He was fast.
He fucking came out of nowhere.

778
01:34:54,154 --> 01:34:56,990
Boom, shoots the Chinaman dead
in two seconds.

779
01:34:57,157 --> 01:35:00,744
Easy, man.
I'm a cop.

780
01:35:00,827 --> 01:35:03,663
Then turns around,
says something to Malky like-

781
01:35:03,747 --> 01:35:05,915
No women, no kids.

782
01:35:13,923 --> 01:35:16,760
I think
it was something personal.

783
01:35:18,178 --> 01:35:23,433
Death is whimsical today.

784
01:35:50,543 --> 01:35:54,130
Blood, do you hear me?

785
01:35:54,214 --> 01:35:58,718
Yeah, I hear you, Stan.
Just chill out, man.

786
01:35:58,753 --> 01:36:01,221
Would you take her
up to my office?

787
01:36:02,889 --> 01:36:04,474
All right.

788
01:36:12,816 --> 01:36:14,984
Jesus fucking Christ.

789
01:36:27,247 --> 01:36:28,748
Leon, my love.

790
01:36:28,832 --> 01:36:31,251
I know where to find the guys
who killed my brother.

791
01:36:31,334 --> 01:36:36,005
Their boss is Norman Stansfield.
He's in the D. E. A. building, room 4602.

792
01:36:36,089 --> 01:36:38,056
I'm gonna do them myself.

793
01:36:38,091 --> 01:36:41,928
If something goes wrong,
I left you 20 grand on the table.

794
01:36:42,011 --> 01:36:45,932
It's for a contract.
Five grand ahead, right?

795
01:36:46,015 --> 01:36:49,936
I know I'll feel better
after I do this.

796
01:36:50,019 --> 01:36:51,938
I love you.

797
01:36:56,943 --> 01:36:58,862
Wait. I won't be long.

798
01:36:58,945 --> 01:37:02,198
I can't park in front like this.
It's a federal building!

799
01:37:06,786 --> 01:37:10,123
He's gonna do the same exact thing
that I said.

800
01:37:10,206 --> 01:37:12,792
A nine millie.

801
01:37:12,876 --> 01:37:14,961
Bullets.

802
01:37:15,045 --> 01:37:16,463
Another nine millie.

803
01:37:19,883 --> 01:37:21,968
What'd you plan to do
with all these guns?

804
01:37:22,052 --> 01:37:25,055
Maybe she was planning on
taking out the whole building.

805
01:37:29,142 --> 01:37:30,977
Holy shit!

806
01:37:31,061 --> 01:37:32,729
What's this? Lunch.

807
01:37:35,398 --> 01:37:37,484
Careful, Blood,
might be poisoned.

808
01:37:37,519 --> 01:37:39,486
There's no anchovies on this.

809
01:37:56,920 --> 01:38:00,673
Is that what you call I won't be long?
I been here for ten minutes.

810
01:38:00,757 --> 01:38:03,426
I did my best.

811
01:38:51,141 --> 01:38:52,642
Do you like it?

812
01:38:54,477 --> 01:38:55,729
Yes.

813
01:38:56,312 --> 01:38:58,314
So say it.

814
01:39:00,817 --> 01:39:02,318
I like it.

815
01:39:17,167 --> 01:39:18,501
Not thirsty?

816
01:39:27,927 --> 01:39:31,014
You know, a girl's first time
is very important.

817
01:39:31,097 --> 01:39:34,184
It determines the rest
of her life sexually.

818
01:39:34,267 --> 01:39:37,353
I read that once in one
of my sister's magazines.

819
01:39:37,687 --> 01:39:41,107
My girlfriends told me
they hated their first experience.

820
01:39:42,359 --> 01:39:45,528
That's because
they didn't love the guys.

821
01:39:46,863 --> 01:39:48,948
They just did it to show off.

822
01:39:49,032 --> 01:39:52,869
Afterwards, they started liking it,
like cigarettes.

823
01:39:56,956 --> 01:39:59,542
Will I like it the first time?

824
01:40:03,630 --> 01:40:05,632
Mathilda, no.

825
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,636
Why not?

826
01:40:10,053 --> 01:40:12,222
I just can't.

827
01:40:13,223 --> 01:40:15,725
- You love someone else?
- No.

828
01:40:16,726 --> 01:40:18,478
I mean-

829
01:40:22,065 --> 01:40:24,734
There was someone a long time ago.

830
01:40:25,985 --> 01:40:28,321
Before I came to the States.

831
01:40:28,738 --> 01:40:31,991
Her father didn't want her
to see me.

832
01:40:32,909 --> 01:40:36,329
She was from
a very respectable family.

833
01:40:37,580 --> 01:40:38,998
Mine was...

834
01:40:39,916 --> 01:40:41,751
you know...

835
01:40:43,420 --> 01:40:45,088
not so respectable.

836
01:40:45,171 --> 01:40:49,092
Her dad went nuts every time
she'd take off to see me.

837
01:40:49,127 --> 01:40:51,428
She still snuck off
to see you, right?

838
01:40:53,263 --> 01:40:54,597
Right.

839
01:40:54,681 --> 01:40:57,100
See, nothing can stop love, Leon.

840
01:40:59,519 --> 01:41:01,521
He killed her.

841
01:41:02,188 --> 01:41:04,274
One shot through the head.

842
01:41:07,861 --> 01:41:12,032
They kept him in jail for two days,
and they let him go free.

843
01:41:13,950 --> 01:41:16,202
They said it was an accident.

844
01:41:18,371 --> 01:41:19,873
So...

845
01:41:21,541 --> 01:41:23,626
one night I...

846
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:26,046
waited for him.

847
01:41:27,380 --> 01:41:29,799
Five hundred feet with a lens.

848
01:41:32,635 --> 01:41:34,471
He also had an accident.

849
01:41:35,722 --> 01:41:39,392
The same night I took a boat
and came here...

850
01:41:39,476 --> 01:41:43,646
to meet up with my father
who was working for Tony.

851
01:41:44,064 --> 01:41:46,316
I was 19.

852
01:41:49,819 --> 01:41:53,656
Since then I've never left
the city, and...

853
01:41:57,327 --> 01:41:59,662
I've never had another girlfriend.

854
01:42:02,665 --> 01:42:05,335
You see, Mathilda...

855
01:42:05,418 --> 01:42:07,504
I wouldn't be a good lover.

856
01:42:09,839 --> 01:42:11,508
Okay.

857
01:42:14,594 --> 01:42:16,846
Would you do me one favor?

858
01:42:16,930 --> 01:42:18,348
What?

859
01:42:18,431 --> 01:42:20,850
I'm sick of watching you
sleep on your chair.

860
01:42:20,934 --> 01:42:23,103
We're gonna share the bed.

861
01:42:24,020 --> 01:42:26,356
I don't think it's a good idea.

862
01:42:27,690 --> 01:42:29,693
It's okay.

863
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:32,112
Put your legs up on the bed.

864
01:42:32,195 --> 01:42:34,280
Yeah. That's nice.

865
01:42:38,702 --> 01:42:41,037
Put your head down.
It's okay. Relax.

866
01:43:02,809 --> 01:43:04,811
Good night, Leon.

867
01:43:07,647 --> 01:43:09,566
Good night.

868
01:43:32,088 --> 01:43:34,257
I want a piece of cake first!

869
01:43:39,262 --> 01:43:43,516
Manolo, take the kids
in the kitchen.

870
01:44:02,619 --> 01:44:05,622
I have a lot of respect
for your business, Tony.

871
01:44:05,705 --> 01:44:08,291
When you've killed for us
in the past...

872
01:44:08,375 --> 01:44:11,878
we've always been satisfied.

873
01:44:11,961 --> 01:44:17,550
That's exactly why today
is going to be very hard for me.

874
01:44:17,634 --> 01:44:19,552
I hope you'll excuse my mood.

875
01:44:23,807 --> 01:44:27,727
My man was killed
right here on your turf.

876
01:44:27,811 --> 01:44:30,980
The Chinks tell me
that the hit man...

877
01:44:31,015 --> 01:44:34,818
was kind of the Italian type.

878
01:44:34,901 --> 01:44:38,738
So we figured that Tony
might know something.

879
01:44:38,822 --> 01:44:41,157
Wait. There's more.

880
01:44:41,192 --> 01:44:43,493
You're gonna love this.

881
01:44:45,829 --> 01:44:51,167
A few hours later, a little 12-year-old
girl comes into my office...

882
01:44:51,251 --> 01:44:56,005
armed to the teeth, with the firm
intention of sending me to the morgue.

883
01:44:56,089 --> 01:44:59,843
Do you know who came and got her
right there in my building?

884
01:45:01,094 --> 01:45:03,304
The very same...

885
01:45:03,339 --> 01:45:05,515
Italian hit man.

886
01:45:10,103 --> 01:45:12,522
I'm dying to meet him.

887
01:45:17,277 --> 01:45:21,614
Relax. Everything's fine.
Sleep well?

888
01:45:21,698 --> 01:45:25,869
I never really sleep.
Got one eye open always.

889
01:45:25,952 --> 01:45:27,954
Yeah, I forgot.

890
01:45:28,038 --> 01:45:30,874
I never saw someone with one eye open
snore so much.

891
01:45:32,459 --> 01:45:35,378
- I snore?
- Like a baby.

892
01:45:37,047 --> 01:45:40,050
I'm gonna get some milk for breakfast.
I won't be long.

893
01:45:40,133 --> 01:45:42,017
Don't forget the code
when you come back.

894
01:45:42,052 --> 01:45:44,554
Two knocks, then one,
and two knocks again. Right?

895
01:45:44,721 --> 01:45:46,139
Right.

896
01:46:04,491 --> 01:46:09,496
Hola seor! Ring these up.
I'm gonna go get some milk.

897
01:46:29,766 --> 01:46:31,768
From here on out,
you don't make a sound.

898
01:46:31,851 --> 01:46:35,772
You answer my questions
by nodding yes or shaking your head no.

899
01:46:35,807 --> 01:46:38,358
Is he alone?

900
01:46:38,441 --> 01:46:40,610
Does he expect you?

901
01:46:40,694 --> 01:46:43,863
Do you have keys
to the apartment?

902
01:46:43,947 --> 01:46:47,283
Is there a code, a way of knocking,
so he knows it's you?

903
01:47:35,331 --> 01:47:36,666
Alpha team.

904
01:47:36,833 --> 01:47:40,420
- Final position. We're ready to go.
- Be careful.

905
01:48:27,467 --> 01:48:30,637
What up? Move! Fuck.

906
01:48:35,975 --> 01:48:37,811
Shit.

907
01:48:39,229 --> 01:48:41,231
Alpha team. Man down.

908
01:48:42,482 --> 01:48:44,651
I told you.

909
01:48:48,488 --> 01:48:51,241
- Bring me everyone.
- What do you mean, everyone?

910
01:48:51,324 --> 01:48:53,827
Everyone!

911
01:49:47,630 --> 01:49:49,549
Take this.

912
01:49:55,388 --> 01:49:58,475
Go take a look.

913
01:50:12,489 --> 01:50:15,909
- Don't move.
- Do you see anything?

914
01:50:17,744 --> 01:50:21,664
It's the guy. He's here.
He's got a gun to my head.

915
01:50:24,751 --> 01:50:26,336
Nobody moves.

916
01:50:26,419 --> 01:50:29,255
- Let the girl go.
- Take it easy, man!

917
01:50:31,674 --> 01:50:35,095
Okay, the girl's coming out.
Let the girl go.

918
01:50:45,271 --> 01:50:48,525
Grab the axe off the wall.
Over there. Go!

919
01:50:51,861 --> 01:50:53,947
You're coming with us.

920
01:51:06,209 --> 01:51:07,961
Christ, he shot him!

921
01:51:09,379 --> 01:51:11,798
Bastard!

922
01:51:20,890 --> 01:51:22,392
Move!

923
01:51:26,396 --> 01:51:28,565
- Shut the fucking water off!
- Got it.

924
01:51:28,648 --> 01:51:30,734
Come!

925
01:51:31,901 --> 01:51:35,572
We're in a bad way here.
Send the cats.

926
01:51:45,749 --> 01:51:49,335
I don't know what happened.
I didn't see 'em coming, I swear!

927
01:51:49,419 --> 01:51:55,008
I just went shopping and I came back,
and they were everywhere.

928
01:51:56,843 --> 01:51:58,928
Stay away from the window.

929
01:52:45,308 --> 01:52:46,726
Come here.

930
01:52:49,229 --> 01:52:50,647
Snipers.

931
01:52:52,732 --> 01:52:56,653
Okay, now, get this fucking asshole
out of there.

932
01:53:14,337 --> 01:53:18,174
- How are we gonna get outta here now?
- Leave it to me. We're checking out.

933
01:54:18,735 --> 01:54:22,322
But it's not big enough for you.
It's barely big enough for me.

934
01:54:22,405 --> 01:54:26,159
- We said no discussion.
- No, I'm not letting-

935
01:54:26,242 --> 01:54:31,331
- I'm not going! I won't go!
- Listen to me.

936
01:54:32,832 --> 01:54:35,085
We have no chance together.
But if I'm alone, I can do it.

937
01:54:35,168 --> 01:54:37,420
Trust me.
I'm in good shape.

938
01:54:37,504 --> 01:54:40,256
I know I've got a lot
of money with Tony.

939
01:54:40,340 --> 01:54:43,009
We'll take it and leave together,
just the two of us.

940
01:54:43,093 --> 01:54:44,511
Go.

941
01:54:44,594 --> 01:54:47,931
You're saying that
so I won't worry.

942
01:54:51,851 --> 01:54:55,355
- I don't wanna lose you.
- You're not gonna lose me.

943
01:54:55,438 --> 01:54:57,357
You've given me
a taste for life.

944
01:54:57,440 --> 01:55:00,777
I wanna be happy,
sleep in a bed, have roots.

945
01:55:00,812 --> 01:55:02,862
You'll never be alone again.

946
01:55:06,199 --> 01:55:09,452
Please, go now, baby. Go.

947
01:55:11,538 --> 01:55:14,040
Calm down.
Go now. Go.

948
01:55:16,710 --> 01:55:20,714
See you at Tony's. I'm gonna
clean them all. Tony's in an hour.

949
01:55:26,386 --> 01:55:28,638
I love you, Mathilda.

950
01:55:28,722 --> 01:55:30,724
I love you, too, Leon.

951
01:56:05,759 --> 01:56:11,264
Hey, what is going on up there?
Take the guy out, not the building.

952
01:56:31,534 --> 01:56:33,620
We've got one breathing here!

953
01:56:35,455 --> 01:56:37,707
Get a medic on the horn!

954
01:56:41,211 --> 01:56:43,546
Clear the hall!
Let him through!

955
01:56:46,216 --> 01:56:50,053
- We've got a wounded man. Make way!
- Down those stairs.

956
01:56:53,223 --> 01:56:54,808
Let's go! Move!

957
01:56:54,891 --> 01:56:56,726
Get that guy off the stairs!

958
01:56:56,810 --> 01:57:00,313
- Get your team back out there!
- I got him!

959
01:57:00,397 --> 01:57:03,483
We've got two men coming
down the stairs. Let's hurry!

960
01:57:25,255 --> 01:57:29,092
You okay?
Hey, I need a medic over here!

961
01:57:29,127 --> 01:57:31,177
Move your fucking asses.

962
01:57:31,261 --> 01:57:33,680
Squad Number One,
what's the status on the apartment?

963
01:57:33,763 --> 01:57:36,099
Can't see shit. Too much smoke.
Give us five minutes.

964
01:57:36,182 --> 01:57:37,600
You got it.

965
01:57:37,684 --> 01:57:41,354
What? Two hundred men can't find
one man and a girl?

966
01:57:41,438 --> 01:57:42,939
Did you find the girl?

967
01:57:52,198 --> 01:57:54,784
How are you doing?
Take your mask off, quick.

968
01:57:57,704 --> 01:58:01,791
Let me see you. That's deep.
Right. And this one here-

969
01:58:01,875 --> 01:58:05,128
You're from the 3rd Precinct?

970
01:58:07,630 --> 01:58:10,800
Let's open up
his sleeve a little bit.

971
01:58:14,054 --> 01:58:17,140
All right, fine. Put it down.
This one.

972
01:58:33,990 --> 01:58:36,076
You stay there for two minutes.
I'll be right back.

973
01:58:36,159 --> 01:58:39,662
Let me put the mask back on.
I breathe better with it.

974
01:58:39,697 --> 01:58:43,666
You're all right.
Sit tight.

975
01:58:49,422 --> 01:58:54,928
Come on, everybody out!
Let's go! Out!

976
01:59:19,369 --> 01:59:22,455
Clear the way, men.

977
01:59:31,548 --> 01:59:33,883
What are you doing here?
Get out. Come on.

978
02:01:23,410 --> 02:01:24,494
Stansfield?

979
02:01:27,330 --> 02:01:29,499
At your service.

980
02:01:38,091 --> 02:01:42,011
This is from...

981
02:01:48,184 --> 02:01:50,437
Mathilda.

982
02:02:05,535 --> 02:02:07,370
Shit.

983
02:02:28,808 --> 02:02:30,226
Get out of here!

984
02:02:33,563 --> 02:02:36,483
Leon asked me
to help you out...

985
02:02:36,566 --> 02:02:40,487
if something happened,
and I think something happened.

986
02:02:40,570 --> 02:02:44,324
He put aside
a little cash for you.

987
02:02:44,407 --> 02:02:47,577
So what I'm suggesting
is that...

988
02:02:47,660 --> 02:02:50,128
seeing as how
you're still so young...

989
02:02:50,163 --> 02:02:53,083
I should hold the money for you
until you're older.

990
02:02:53,166 --> 02:02:55,251
Like a bank, you know, except...

991
02:02:55,335 --> 02:02:59,422
it's better than a bank
'cause banks always get knocked off.

992
02:02:59,506 --> 02:03:02,175
No one knocks off old Tony.

993
02:03:02,258 --> 02:03:04,928
But it's your money.
In the meantime...

994
02:03:05,011 --> 02:03:08,932
all you gotta do is come here
every once in awhile...

995
02:03:09,015 --> 02:03:12,852
and I'll dish it out
so you can have a little fun.

996
02:03:13,937 --> 02:03:15,355
Here.

997
02:03:15,438 --> 02:03:20,944
- Here's a hundred bucks to start.
- Can't I get a job instead?

998
02:03:21,027 --> 02:03:25,949
A job?
What the hell can you do?

999
02:03:26,032 --> 02:03:27,867
I can clean.

1000
02:03:29,202 --> 02:03:31,705
I ain't got no work
for a 12-year-old kid...

1001
02:03:31,788 --> 02:03:33,873
so get it out
of your goddamn head!

1002
02:03:33,957 --> 02:03:36,626
It's over!
The game's over!

1003
02:03:36,710 --> 02:03:39,462
Leon's dead!

1004
02:03:39,546 --> 02:03:41,548
You hear me?

1005
02:03:48,722 --> 02:03:53,476
Come on. You think
I ain't hurting too?

1006
02:03:58,898 --> 02:04:01,317
But he's dead.

1007
02:04:01,401 --> 02:04:05,321
You're gonna forget all this craziness
and get your little ass back to school.

1008
02:04:06,573 --> 02:04:09,659
Now take this money
and get the hell outta here.

1009
02:04:09,743 --> 02:04:11,828
Don't let me see your face
till next month...

1010
02:04:11,911 --> 02:04:16,249
'cause something tells me
I'm about to lose my famous kind streak.

1011
02:05:07,467 --> 02:05:10,887
My parents...

1012
02:05:10,970 --> 02:05:13,104
died...

1013
02:05:13,139 --> 02:05:17,811
in a car accident
four weeks ago.

1014
02:05:17,846 --> 02:05:19,813
It was terrible.

1015
02:05:22,315 --> 02:05:26,611
We didn't have the time to get to know
one another when you first came here...

1016
02:05:26,646 --> 02:05:30,907
but I want you to know I'm not the kind
of woman who'd let down a child...

1017
02:05:30,990 --> 02:05:34,292
whatever her situation,
whatever her mistake.

1018
02:05:34,327 --> 02:05:39,499
So I'm going to help you and do my best
to welcome you here again.

1019
02:05:41,334 --> 02:05:44,003
But on one condition:

1020
02:05:44,087 --> 02:05:47,340
You have to stop lying to me,
Mathilda.

1021
02:05:47,375 --> 02:05:49,509
I want you to take a chance...

1022
02:05:49,592 --> 02:05:52,512
and trust me.

1023
02:05:52,595 --> 02:05:55,098
Tell me what happened to you.

1024
02:05:58,518 --> 02:06:01,688
My family got shot down
by D. E. A. officers...

1025
02:06:01,723 --> 02:06:05,108
because of a drug problem.

1026
02:06:05,191 --> 02:06:07,826
I left with the greatest guy on Earth.

1027
02:06:07,861 --> 02:06:12,699
He was a hit man, the best in town,
but he died this morning.

1028
02:06:12,734 --> 02:06:16,619
If you don't help me,
I'll be dead by tonight.

1029
02:06:35,972 --> 02:06:39,642
- You know her?
- I've never seen her.

1030
02:07:06,252 --> 02:07:08,922
I think we'll be okay here, Leon.
