2
00:01:02,870 --> 00:01:06,863
Hello, Mr. Michaux!
You're no bother at all!

3
00:01:07,842 --> 00:01:11,045
I'm at the park,
practicing my boomerang.

4
00:01:11,045 --> 00:01:15,038
I do it before the office,
to relieve stress.

5
00:01:15,350 --> 00:01:19,343
Dinner, Wednesday evening?
I'd be delighted!

6
00:01:22,523 --> 00:01:24,525
Hi!

7
00:01:24,525 --> 00:01:27,695
- Coming to the game Wednesday?
- No, I have a dinner party.

8
00:01:27,695 --> 00:01:30,064
- Charlie. Coffee, please.
- What dinner party?

9
00:01:30,064 --> 00:01:33,268
- One of our customers invited me.
- Why you?

10
00:01:33,268 --> 00:01:37,261
At the bank, he stops
at my window and chats.

11
00:01:37,305 --> 00:01:39,841
- What about?
- Everything... politics,

12
00:01:39,841 --> 00:01:41,442
entertainment, sports...

13
00:01:41,442 --> 00:01:43,511
He asks for my opinion
and I tell him.

14
00:01:43,511 --> 00:01:46,948
Why would he ask
an idiot like you?

15
00:01:46,948 --> 00:01:50,518
Listen, there'll be
big shots at that dinner!

16
00:01:50,518 --> 00:01:53,855
Mr. Perier says they're very
interested in my ideas.

17
00:01:53,855 --> 00:01:56,924
So maybe the idiot
isn't me, okay?

18
00:01:56,924 --> 00:01:58,559
That's wonderful!

19
00:01:58,559 --> 00:02:01,095
I'll definitely be there
on Wednesday,

20
00:02:01,095 --> 00:02:05,088
unless something
unexpected...

21
00:02:13,441 --> 00:02:15,443
- You coming or going?
- Going.

22
00:02:15,443 --> 00:02:17,378
To Biarritz.

23
00:02:17,378 --> 00:02:19,847
- What's in Biarritz?
- It's my dad's birthday.

24
00:02:19,847 --> 00:02:21,349
Say hello for me.

25
00:02:21,349 --> 00:02:23,351
A coffee, please.

26
00:02:23,351 --> 00:02:26,587
- You're coming Wednesday?
- No, I'm busy. Are you going?

27
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:30,580
Sure. I'm in a bind.
I don't have an idiot.

28
00:02:30,892 --> 00:02:34,362
I've looked all over.
Got one on hand?

29
00:02:34,362 --> 00:02:38,355
No, but I'll think about it.
I'm late.

30
00:02:41,903 --> 00:02:43,671
What's that?

31
00:02:43,671 --> 00:02:46,074
Dad collects them.
A beauty, huh?

32
00:02:46,074 --> 00:02:48,476
18th century.
He'll love it.

33
00:02:48,476 --> 00:02:51,612
- Your dad collects ladles?
- He has over 300 of them.

34
00:02:51,612 --> 00:02:53,548
He's retired.
Keeps him busy.

35
00:02:53,548 --> 00:02:57,518
Interesting! Could he discuss
his passion in public,

36
00:02:57,518 --> 00:03:00,621
- tell us the story of ladles?
- No, Pierre.

37
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:03,524
- Does he come to Paris?
- No, Pierre, not Dad.

38
00:03:03,524 --> 00:03:05,893
What? It's a very
original hobby.

39
00:03:05,893 --> 00:03:09,530
- You want him for your dinner?
- How can you say that?

40
00:03:09,530 --> 00:03:12,433
I'd take your dad
to an idiot dinner?

41
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:14,001
Yes.

42
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:16,037
You think
I'm a bastard, eh?

43
00:03:16,037 --> 00:03:17,071
Yes.

44
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,574
I was just kidding.

45
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:23,567
But I don't have an idiot yet.
I'm panicked.

46
00:03:39,026 --> 00:03:43,019
Hi, there.

47
00:03:44,499 --> 00:03:47,101
Sorry!

48
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:51,094
Thanks.

49
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:03,473
- Sorry, it fell out of my folder.
- That's okay.

50
00:04:05,787 --> 00:04:08,423
- Don't you recognize it?
- What?

51
00:04:08,423 --> 00:04:12,416
The Eiffel Tower! Made of matches.
346,422 to be exact.

52
00:04:14,929 --> 00:04:16,597
You did that?

53
00:04:16,597 --> 00:04:18,132
One of my finest pieces.

54
00:04:18,132 --> 00:04:22,125
- You've done others?
- Are you kidding?

55
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:28,142
Take the problem of lift.

56
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:32,135
In this construction,
that was the biggest challenge.

57
00:04:33,915 --> 00:04:35,950
But let's start
from the beginning.

58
00:04:35,950 --> 00:04:39,943
What is
a suspension bridge?

59
00:04:40,855 --> 00:04:44,848
The angle of the matches can't be
a tenth of a degree off!

60
00:04:45,760 --> 00:04:49,753
A tenth of a degree,
think of it!

61
00:04:53,534 --> 00:04:57,527
The Concorde was
a different problem.

62
00:05:04,812 --> 00:05:07,815
- Here's a little quiz.
- We've arrived!

63
00:05:07,815 --> 00:05:10,818
Which took me longer,
Eiffel or Concorde?

64
00:05:10,818 --> 00:05:13,921
- We've arrived!
- Really?

65
00:05:13,921 --> 00:05:17,914
Already?
Time did fly!

66
00:05:24,832 --> 00:05:28,825
Pierre Brochant, please.
This is Jean Cordier.

67
00:05:29,937 --> 00:05:31,672
Pierre? I've got one!

68
00:05:31,672 --> 00:05:35,665
- What's he like?
- A world champion!

69
00:07:48,909 --> 00:07:50,645
How's the soccer fan?

70
00:07:50,645 --> 00:07:53,981
"Marseilles are turds!
Marseilles are turds!"

71
00:07:53,981 --> 00:07:57,718
Auxerre will get it
Wednesday!

72
00:07:57,718 --> 00:07:59,754
Look at that asshole!

73
00:07:59,754 --> 00:08:03,747
- Sorry, Louisette.
- I'm used to it.

74
00:08:05,926 --> 00:08:08,929
Brochant Publishers here.
Mr. Pignon, please.

75
00:08:08,929 --> 00:08:10,431
Speaking.

76
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,933
Mr. Brochant for you.

77
00:08:12,933 --> 00:08:14,402
- Mr. Pignon?
- Yes.

78
00:08:14,402 --> 00:08:17,204
My friend Jean Cordier
gave me your number.

79
00:08:17,204 --> 00:08:21,208
- You met him on the train.
- Yes, of course.

80
00:08:21,208 --> 00:08:24,178
He said a lot about you.
I want to meet you.

81
00:08:24,178 --> 00:08:26,714
To meet me?

82
00:08:26,714 --> 00:08:29,817
Franois Pignon!
He was so awed,

83
00:08:29,817 --> 00:08:33,810
he was speechless.
It'll be a delight!

84
00:08:36,724 --> 00:08:39,493
- Who's Michaux bringing?
- A boomerang collector.

85
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:42,096
- That's a good one.
- Priceless, I hear.

86
00:08:42,096 --> 00:08:44,965
- How many of us will there be?
- 10, with Pignon.

87
00:08:44,965 --> 00:08:48,958
It's shaping up.

88
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:56,299
- Shit!
- What is it?

89
00:09:00,147 --> 00:09:04,140
Christine!

90
00:09:25,806 --> 00:09:29,477
- Did you cancel your dinner?
- My God, that's cold!

91
00:09:29,477 --> 00:09:32,813
- So, did you cancel?
- A sore back needs heat.

92
00:09:32,813 --> 00:09:35,316
- Dr. Sorbier said ice.
- You reached him?

93
00:09:35,316 --> 00:09:37,818
In his car.
He'll be here soon.

94
00:09:37,818 --> 00:09:41,811
Great. I need a drink.
A splash of scotch.

95
00:09:43,023 --> 00:09:47,027
- Did your sore back make you deaf?
- No, I didn't cancel.

96
00:09:47,027 --> 00:09:49,530
You're still going
to that sinister dinner?

97
00:09:49,530 --> 00:09:53,523
It's great fun.
You think it's sinister...

98
00:09:53,801 --> 00:09:57,138
Don't sulk just
because I enjoy it!

99
00:09:57,138 --> 00:10:01,131
Come on. Stay with me.
You know I'm not feeling well.

100
00:10:01,475 --> 00:10:05,179
So come with me, for a change.
You'll have a blast.

101
00:10:05,179 --> 00:10:08,015
Making fun
of some poor guy?

102
00:10:08,015 --> 00:10:12,008
But he's an idiot!
Idiots are fair game.

103
00:10:12,052 --> 00:10:14,855
A drink at his place,
then dinner.

104
00:10:14,855 --> 00:10:16,957
- At a restaurant?
- No,

105
00:10:16,957 --> 00:10:18,826
his friend has organized
a big dinner.

106
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:22,363
I'm nervous.
Which one?

107
00:10:22,363 --> 00:10:25,566
- They're the same.
- This one's redder.

108
00:10:25,566 --> 00:10:29,559
It's more festive.

109
00:10:29,937 --> 00:10:33,930
Mustn't forget
my model file.

110
00:10:34,175 --> 00:10:38,078
He wants to do a book!
On my models, you realize?

111
00:10:38,078 --> 00:10:40,281
Hurry, you'll be late.

112
00:10:40,281 --> 00:10:42,016
You asked him here?

113
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,920
To study him before dinner.
I hear he's fabulous.

114
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,423
I'll leave you two together.
Enjoy!

115
00:10:49,423 --> 00:10:51,959
- Where are you going?
- I have a dinner too.

116
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:55,196
- I didn't want to go, but...
- Dinner with whom?

117
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:58,199
Is it him?
I don't want to meet him.

118
00:10:58,199 --> 00:11:02,203
No, it's the doctor.

119
00:11:02,203 --> 00:11:06,196
- Dr. Sorbier.
- Come on up, Doctor.

120
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,945
Good evening, Doctor.

121
00:11:10,945 --> 00:11:13,480
Fix him. He has an important
dinner tonight.

122
00:11:13,480 --> 00:11:15,883
- Christine!
- An idiot dinner.

123
00:11:15,883 --> 00:11:18,886
Each regular has
to bring an idiot.

124
00:11:18,886 --> 00:11:20,321
Christine, please!

125
00:11:20,321 --> 00:11:22,890
The idiots don't know
why they've been picked.

126
00:11:22,890 --> 00:11:25,860
The fun is making them talk.
Hilarious!

127
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:29,853
Not to me, so I'm leaving.
Good night, doctor.

128
00:11:34,068 --> 00:11:38,072
Sorry. I called you
to fix my back, not my marriage.

129
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:42,065
- Can I wash my hands?
- First door on the left.

130
00:11:42,343 --> 00:11:46,336
In college, we used
to invite ugly girls.

131
00:11:46,447 --> 00:11:48,582
The ugliest one
got a prize.

132
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:50,584
Yes, we did that too.

133
00:11:50,584 --> 00:11:53,621
- But idiots are funnier.
- But less definite.

134
00:11:53,621 --> 00:11:56,290
Some idiots are quite obvious.

135
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,283
Mine's unmistakable.

136
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,599
You look great.

137
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:07,268
Thanks, Louisette.

138
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:11,261
Have a nice evening.
Dazzle them!

139
00:12:12,072 --> 00:12:13,941
- A friend of yours?
- No.

140
00:12:13,941 --> 00:12:15,943
My friends are not
that dumb.

141
00:12:15,943 --> 00:12:19,936
We pick aces.
This is big league.

142
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:22,549
- Where do you find them?
- It's hard.

143
00:12:22,549 --> 00:12:26,020
A real manhunt.
We have scouts who tip us off.

144
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:30,013
Fifth lumbar vertebra!

145
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:38,999
- Is it serious?
- No, but call off your dinner.

146
00:12:38,999 --> 00:12:41,602
- No!
- Rest your back tonight.

147
00:12:41,602 --> 00:12:43,938
- I'll stop by tomorrow.
- But, doctor...

148
00:12:43,938 --> 00:12:45,639
I have a prime idiot coming!

149
00:12:45,639 --> 00:12:49,109
Give me a shot!
I don't care! Anything!

150
00:12:49,109 --> 00:12:53,102
Ice-bag and rest, or you'll be
out for three weeks.

151
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:55,316
I'm jinxed.

152
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:57,584
My phone book, please.

153
00:12:57,584 --> 00:13:01,577
The phone.

154
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:05,949
What's his name again?
Franois Pignon.

155
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,299
- What does he do?
- He's a tax man.

156
00:13:12,299 --> 00:13:14,768
Isn't that dangerous?
What if he finds out?

157
00:13:14,768 --> 00:13:18,761
He won't. We're careful.
No idiot ever found out.

158
00:13:21,008 --> 00:13:23,110
He's out.

159
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:26,146
- Holy shit!
- What?

160
00:13:26,146 --> 00:13:30,139
His message. He tries
to be witty. It's pathetic.

161
00:13:31,752 --> 00:13:35,255
Franois is out,
but don't pout!

162
00:13:35,255 --> 00:13:39,248
No need to weep,
wait for the beep!

163
00:13:40,327 --> 00:13:42,663
Your turn to peep!

164
00:13:42,663 --> 00:13:46,656
- Isn't he something?
- Outstanding, I'd say.

165
00:13:47,401 --> 00:13:51,394
- Here he is.
- Don't move, I'll get it.

166
00:13:53,007 --> 00:13:54,775
It's Franois Pignon.

167
00:13:54,775 --> 00:13:58,779
6th floor,
on the left.

168
00:13:58,779 --> 00:14:00,481
He's coming.

169
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:03,684
I'll leave you a sedative.
Take two if you're in pain.

170
00:14:03,684 --> 00:14:07,488
- Wait for him. It'll be fun.
- No. I'm late.

171
00:14:07,488 --> 00:14:10,124
See you tomorrow. Call me at home
if it gets worse.

172
00:14:10,124 --> 00:14:14,128
See you.
Leave the door open.

173
00:14:14,128 --> 00:14:16,663
- Do me a favor.
- Certainly.

174
00:14:16,663 --> 00:14:20,656
Never invite me to dinner.
I'd wonder!

175
00:14:28,509 --> 00:14:32,502
- Good evening.
- Evening, sir.

176
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:35,849
Go on in. It's open.

177
00:14:35,849 --> 00:14:39,842
Thanks.

178
00:14:43,524 --> 00:14:46,093
Good evening, Mr. Pignon!
Come on in!

179
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:48,695
I can't get up.

180
00:14:48,695 --> 00:14:52,199
I twisted my back.
We'll have to put off our dinner.

181
00:14:52,199 --> 00:14:55,536
I'm sorry for you.
A sore back is no fun.

182
00:14:55,536 --> 00:14:58,105
It's silly. What are you doing
next Wednesday?

183
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,674
Next Wednesday... nothing.

184
00:15:00,674 --> 00:15:04,667
My friend's giving another dinner.
You're invited.

185
00:15:04,845 --> 00:15:07,481
How very nice.

186
00:15:07,481 --> 00:15:11,474
We missed you today.
We won't miss you next week.

187
00:15:12,119 --> 00:15:16,112
...l'm talking about
the authentic boomerang,

188
00:15:16,423 --> 00:15:20,416
not those you find
in Sydney souvenir stores.

189
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:25,154
The primitive boomerang
of proud aboriginal warriors,

190
00:15:27,167 --> 00:15:28,769
that boomerang

191
00:15:28,769 --> 00:15:32,762
has a dynamism, a motion

192
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:37,300
when it's thrown correctly,
that is miraculous!

193
00:15:38,212 --> 00:15:39,480
How are you?

194
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:43,217
Not too hot. I'm a wreck.
It's a real shame.

195
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:45,752
Sit down.

196
00:15:45,752 --> 00:15:49,189
No, it won't be
possible tonight.

197
00:15:49,189 --> 00:15:52,759
We haven't sat down
to dinner yet, so...

198
00:15:52,759 --> 00:15:55,796
It can behead
a kangaroo from 150 feet!

199
00:15:55,796 --> 00:15:58,565
Okay, but don't count on us.

200
00:15:58,565 --> 00:16:02,558
Yes, he's here.
Very nice.

201
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:06,740
He looks like
a real winner.

202
00:16:06,740 --> 00:16:10,733
No, I'll bring him over
next week. Bye!

203
00:16:17,284 --> 00:16:19,620
So how are you,
Mr. Pignon?

204
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:23,613
Very well. Thanks.

205
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:27,794
The message on your machine
is so witty.

206
00:16:27,794 --> 00:16:31,632
Really? I wanted it
to be original.

207
00:16:31,632 --> 00:16:33,467
I'm still laughing.

208
00:16:33,467 --> 00:16:36,270
Everybody comments on it.

209
00:16:36,270 --> 00:16:38,505
Friends ask me
to record their messages.

210
00:16:38,505 --> 00:16:42,498
- I can see why.
- I could do yours...

211
00:16:42,910 --> 00:16:45,212
- No need.
- It'd take a minute.

212
00:16:45,212 --> 00:16:46,713
No, it's fine as it is,

213
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:49,483
even if it might be
a little conservative for you.

214
00:16:49,483 --> 00:16:52,553
I'm delighted to meet you.

215
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:54,521
Likewise.

216
00:16:54,521 --> 00:16:56,957
Since you called me
at the Ministry,

217
00:16:56,957 --> 00:16:59,393
I've been walking on air.

218
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:03,230
I thought it was a joke.
Did I sound dumb on the phone?

219
00:17:03,230 --> 00:17:06,833
Yes... I mean, no.
You were perfect.

220
00:17:06,833 --> 00:17:10,237
A big publisher wanting
to do a book on my models,

221
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:12,639
inviting me to dinner...

222
00:17:12,639 --> 00:17:15,008
you've changed my life.

223
00:17:15,008 --> 00:17:19,001
The book project isn't
quite final yet...

224
00:17:19,713 --> 00:17:23,706
I brought photos
of my finest pieces.

225
00:17:26,486 --> 00:17:29,690
- The Eiffel Tower.
- Superb.

226
00:17:29,690 --> 00:17:32,226
- Took me eight months.
- It shows.

227
00:17:32,226 --> 00:17:35,329
- You do them at night?
- And on weekends.

228
00:17:35,329 --> 00:17:37,397
- Whenever I have time.
- Are you married?

229
00:17:37,397 --> 00:17:39,766
Yes... I mean, no.

230
00:17:39,766 --> 00:17:41,735
- The Tancarville Bridge.
- Great!

231
00:17:41,735 --> 00:17:45,038
- So are you married or not?
- Well...

232
00:17:45,038 --> 00:17:47,774
- my wife left me.
- She did?

233
00:17:47,774 --> 00:17:49,676
For a friend of mine.

234
00:17:49,676 --> 00:17:51,645
Those things happen.

235
00:17:51,645 --> 00:17:54,715
A guy I knew at the Ministry.
Not a bad guy.

236
00:17:54,715 --> 00:17:57,284
I invited him home.
She fell for him.

237
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:01,277
I don't know why,
because he's no genius.

238
00:18:03,490 --> 00:18:05,659
You know how many matches
in this one?

239
00:18:05,659 --> 00:18:08,996
- What do you mean, no genius?
- The guy she ran off with.

240
00:18:08,996 --> 00:18:11,865
What a dumbbell!

241
00:18:11,865 --> 00:18:13,600
Come on, say a number.

242
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,336
Dumber than... I mean,
you're pretty smart,

243
00:18:16,336 --> 00:18:18,472
so how would he rate
against you?

244
00:18:18,472 --> 00:18:22,465
Sorry to be so blunt,
but he's quite the idiot!

245
00:18:22,676 --> 00:18:24,411
My God!

246
00:18:24,411 --> 00:18:25,912
So?

247
00:18:25,912 --> 00:18:29,049
How could she run off
with an idiot?

248
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:33,042
I agree. He only talks
about windsurfing!

249
00:18:33,587 --> 00:18:37,357
- Can I meet him?
- You like windsurfing?

250
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,092
I love it.

251
00:18:39,092 --> 00:18:43,085
Then you'll love Benjamin!
We call him Dumbo.

252
00:18:44,398 --> 00:18:48,391
He's in the phone book.
Under Benjamin, not Dumbo.

253
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,976
So, how many matches?

254
00:18:55,976 --> 00:18:57,744
2,000?

255
00:18:57,744 --> 00:19:01,737
346,422!

256
00:19:03,450 --> 00:19:06,386
That's not all.
How many tubes of glue?

257
00:19:06,386 --> 00:19:09,856
We're going
to that dinner!

258
00:19:09,856 --> 00:19:13,026
- You can walk?
- I'll try.

259
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,362
- You got a car?
- Sure.

260
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,355
If you drive, we'll manage.
Help me up.

261
00:19:21,468 --> 00:19:25,461
Here we go.

262
00:19:27,374 --> 00:19:29,843
You okay?

263
00:19:29,843 --> 00:19:33,836
Take it easy.

264
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,950
- 37!
- What?

265
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:40,943
37 tubes of glue.

266
00:19:41,588 --> 00:19:45,581
We'll have a wonderful evening,
Mr. Pignon!

267
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:53,422
I'm so sorry.
Are you hurt?

268
00:19:53,834 --> 00:19:57,827
There might be broken bones.

269
00:20:01,541 --> 00:20:03,744
- Now what?
- A chiropractor!

270
00:20:03,744 --> 00:20:06,680
- No need.
- A buddy of mine. He's great.

271
00:20:06,680 --> 00:20:09,816
- I don't need him!
- He's the best in Courbevoie.

272
00:20:09,816 --> 00:20:13,809
I don't want him!
Go home, I'll be fine.

273
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:16,189
- What about dinner?
- It's off.

274
00:20:16,189 --> 00:20:20,182
I'm in no shape now!

275
00:20:22,696 --> 00:20:24,064
The machine's on.

276
00:20:24,064 --> 00:20:27,401
We're out.
Speak after the beep.

277
00:20:27,401 --> 00:20:30,737
Your message
is a bit flat.

278
00:20:30,737 --> 00:20:34,074
It's me. I won't be
coming home tonight.

279
00:20:34,074 --> 00:20:37,911
I may never
come home again.

280
00:20:37,911 --> 00:20:40,814
Sorry to tell you this
on a machine,

281
00:20:40,814 --> 00:20:42,983
but maybe it's best.

282
00:20:42,983 --> 00:20:46,976
Goodbye, Pierre.

283
00:20:51,725 --> 00:20:55,718
I'll be going now.

284
00:20:55,929 --> 00:20:58,231
- Sure you don't need anything?
- Yes.

285
00:20:58,231 --> 00:21:02,224
Everything's fine.
Good night.

286
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,842
Sorry...

287
00:21:08,842 --> 00:21:12,835
I forgot my briefcase.

288
00:21:17,451 --> 00:21:21,087
I'm with you, Mr. Brochant.
All the way!

289
00:21:21,087 --> 00:21:25,080
- Thanks a lot. Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

290
00:21:25,659 --> 00:21:29,463
- What can I do for you?
- Nothing. I'm fine. Good night.

291
00:21:29,463 --> 00:21:32,666
I really know
what you're going through.

292
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,901
I'd like to be left alone!

293
00:21:34,901 --> 00:21:36,937
I said that when she left me,

294
00:21:36,937 --> 00:21:39,906
and I nearly died of grief
alone in my house.

295
00:21:39,906 --> 00:21:41,808
Plus, you've got a bad back.

296
00:21:41,808 --> 00:21:44,611
She hasn't left me.
She's a bit depressed.

297
00:21:44,611 --> 00:21:47,080
She'll be back.
Now go home, and good night!

298
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:51,073
"She'll be back."
That's what I said for two years.

299
00:21:52,652 --> 00:21:54,688
I'm off to bed.
Turn out the lights.

300
00:21:54,688 --> 00:21:56,957
Can't I call
my chiropractor buddy?

301
00:21:56,957 --> 00:21:59,726
- No!
- He's great.

302
00:21:59,726 --> 00:22:02,696
And cheap. Know what
he charges for house calls?

303
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:06,689
I'm with Pr. Sorbier
of the West Side Hospital.

304
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,969
I don't need your buddy!

305
00:22:08,969 --> 00:22:12,105
Yours may be good,
but look at you now!

306
00:22:12,105 --> 00:22:14,274
Because you fell on me!

307
00:22:14,274 --> 00:22:18,267
Why do I even argue
with this jerk?

308
00:22:18,645 --> 00:22:21,948
You're like a horse
that missed a jump.

309
00:22:21,948 --> 00:22:24,150
At the track, they'd put you
out of your misery.

310
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:26,520
Go away, Mr. Pignon!

311
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,688
This could be dangerous.

312
00:22:28,688 --> 00:22:32,292
If the spinal marrow is affected,
you might get paralyzed.

313
00:22:32,292 --> 00:22:35,996
Then, you'll need
quite the miracle!

314
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:39,989
- Call Sorbier!
- That's better!

315
00:22:41,668 --> 00:22:45,661
- What's his number?
- Look in that book.

316
00:23:00,854 --> 00:23:03,990
Pr. Sorbier, please.
For Pierre Brochant.

317
00:23:03,990 --> 00:23:07,594
- Pierre Brochant?
- I need the doctor right away.

318
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:11,587
- There's no doctor here.
- Sorry, I dialed a wrong number.

319
00:23:11,798 --> 00:23:14,167
I skipped a line.

320
00:23:14,167 --> 00:23:18,160
- The handwriting's so tiny.
- Who cares?! Just hang up!

321
00:23:18,805 --> 00:23:20,874
Yes, I'm at his place.

322
00:23:20,874 --> 00:23:22,976
Yes, he's here.

323
00:23:22,976 --> 00:23:25,345
No, he's in
pretty bad shape.

324
00:23:25,345 --> 00:23:28,682
He's got a bad back.

325
00:23:28,682 --> 00:23:31,084
He can't move,
he's spread out on the floor

326
00:23:31,084 --> 00:23:35,088
- like a sack of potatoes.
- Who are you talking to?

327
00:23:35,088 --> 00:23:37,991
Who am I talking to?

328
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:40,026
Really?

329
00:23:40,026 --> 00:23:43,330
Then I can tell you
he's in very bad shape.

330
00:23:43,330 --> 00:23:45,699
His wife left him, too.

331
00:23:45,699 --> 00:23:49,002
- He's broken, body and soul!
- Stop that!

332
00:23:49,002 --> 00:23:52,995
I must go.
He's about to lose it. Bye!

333
00:23:54,107 --> 00:23:58,100
- It was your sister!
- I don't have a sister.

334
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:00,280
You don't?

335
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:03,883
I said, "Who is this?"
She said, "His sister."

336
00:24:03,883 --> 00:24:05,819
He called Marlene!

337
00:24:05,819 --> 00:24:07,754
She's not your sister?

338
00:24:07,754 --> 00:24:10,056
Her name is
Marlene Hissister!

339
00:24:10,056 --> 00:24:14,049
How could I know?
She said, "Marlene, his sister."

340
00:24:14,160 --> 00:24:18,153
- It's confusing.
- Give me that phone.

341
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:22,135
Hurry! If my wife's gone,
she'll come running.

342
00:24:22,135 --> 00:24:24,904
All I need
is a nymphomaniac!

343
00:24:24,904 --> 00:24:28,897
She's a nympho, too?
Oh, my!

344
00:24:32,245 --> 00:24:34,948
Stop it, will you?

345
00:24:34,948 --> 00:24:37,183
If I call,
she'll go on for hours!

346
00:24:37,183 --> 00:24:41,176
Tell her my wife's back.
Hurry, damn it!

347
00:24:41,454 --> 00:24:44,057
- My wife's back, everything's well.
- Really?

348
00:24:44,057 --> 00:24:47,727
- That's what you say!
- Right, sorry.

349
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:51,720
Marlene Hissister!

350
00:25:00,874 --> 00:25:03,043
Marlene Hissister?

351
00:25:03,043 --> 00:25:07,036
It's me again. I'm calling to say
Mrs. Brochant came home.

352
00:25:07,313 --> 00:25:09,049
Yes, a moment ago.

353
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:13,042
She's fine, Mr. Brochant is fine,
everybody's fine.

354
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:16,990
His back is sore,
but he's taking it better.

355
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,958
Say goodbye!

356
00:25:18,958 --> 00:25:22,951
I'm not really a friend of his.
He likes my models.

357
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:28,090
I make matchstick models
of engineering feats...

358
00:25:29,169 --> 00:25:32,505
the Tancarville Bridge,
the Golden Gate Bridge...

359
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:35,775
- She doesn't care!
- She's very interested!

360
00:25:35,775 --> 00:25:39,713
- Don't tie up my phone line!
- Sorry, I have to go now.

361
00:25:39,713 --> 00:25:42,782
He needs me and in his shape,
I can't leave him alone.

362
00:25:42,782 --> 00:25:44,017
Oh my God!

363
00:25:44,017 --> 00:25:46,920
Alone? His wife isn't back?

364
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,488
What?

365
00:25:48,488 --> 00:25:52,459
Sure she's back...
but she stepped out.

366
00:25:52,459 --> 00:25:55,128
She hasn't walked out,
she stepped out...

367
00:25:55,128 --> 00:25:57,163
to throw out the garbage.

368
00:25:57,163 --> 00:25:59,265
What is this?

369
00:25:59,265 --> 00:26:03,136
Aries, with Gemini ascending.

370
00:26:03,136 --> 00:26:06,940
- Aries don't lie. I'm not lying.
- Enough!

371
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:10,933
I'll be right over.

372
00:26:11,111 --> 00:26:14,848
She said, "I'll be right over,"
and hung up.

373
00:26:14,848 --> 00:26:18,318
Give me that phone!

374
00:26:18,318 --> 00:26:21,154
Sorry, I played it too cool.

375
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:25,147
I didn't expect her
to be so cunning.

376
00:26:30,897 --> 00:26:32,832
It's you, darling.

377
00:26:32,832 --> 00:26:35,502
I'll drop off the dogs
and be right over.

378
00:26:35,502 --> 00:26:37,904
Don't!

379
00:26:37,904 --> 00:26:40,807
My wife'll be home any minute.
Don't come over!

380
00:26:40,807 --> 00:26:43,843
Sorry, but I doubt
she'll be returning.

381
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:46,980
Know what I think?
She's back with Leblanc.

382
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:50,973
Leblanc? Why even bring him up?
It's over between them!

383
00:26:51,818 --> 00:26:55,811
I say she's with no one!
Please stay home tonight, okay?

384
00:26:57,991 --> 00:27:01,461
That nut won't listen!

385
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:05,165
You can go now.
I need to be alone.

386
00:27:05,165 --> 00:27:08,835
Can I help you to your room?
You can't sleep on the floor!

387
00:27:08,835 --> 00:27:12,828
Get me to the sofa.

388
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:15,508
Slowly.

389
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:19,501
Look ahead.

390
00:27:20,547 --> 00:27:22,982
- They're all alike, eh?
- What?

391
00:27:22,982 --> 00:27:26,975
I gather yours ran off
with someone too.

392
00:27:27,287 --> 00:27:29,823
She ran off with nobody.

393
00:27:29,823 --> 00:27:31,958
Mine ran off
with nobody, also,

394
00:27:31,958 --> 00:27:35,428
because Benjamin
is a nobody.

395
00:27:35,428 --> 00:27:39,299
- But she still ran off with him!
- Hadn't we said goodbye?

396
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:41,100
Yes, I'll be off.

397
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:45,093
I'll get you some water
for the pills, then I'll leave.

398
00:27:47,207 --> 00:27:49,275
Is he a friend of yours?

399
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:53,268
Go to hell!

400
00:27:59,619 --> 00:28:03,612
Briefcase!

401
00:28:08,561 --> 00:28:12,554
When you asked about my life,
I didn't say "Go to hell."

402
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:16,402
Farewell, Mr. Brochant.

403
00:28:16,402 --> 00:28:20,395
Leblanc was my best friend.
We quarreled two years ago. Okay?

404
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:23,409
Over what?

405
00:28:23,409 --> 00:28:26,012
He made a pass at your wife?

406
00:28:26,012 --> 00:28:28,181
No, I stole her from him.

407
00:28:28,181 --> 00:28:31,384
He lived with Christine.
She left him for me.

408
00:28:31,384 --> 00:28:34,554
They wrote a novel together
and brought it to me.

409
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:37,156
Then what?

410
00:28:37,156 --> 00:28:40,627
I took both the novel
and Christine.

411
00:28:40,627 --> 00:28:44,620
All you windsurfers
steal your friends' wives?

412
00:28:45,565 --> 00:28:48,401
I'm no windsurfer!
Give me a break!

413
00:28:48,401 --> 00:28:50,270
But you told me...

414
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,472
I don't do it enough
to swipe my friends'...

415
00:28:52,472 --> 00:28:54,407
what am I saying?

416
00:28:54,407 --> 00:28:57,644
Is your curiosity satisfied?

417
00:28:57,644 --> 00:29:00,580
Why don't you call him?

418
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:04,083
- Who?
- Him. To see if she's with him!

419
00:29:04,083 --> 00:29:07,320
I call and say,
"Did the woman I stole come back?"

420
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:09,555
At least, you'd know.

421
00:29:09,555 --> 00:29:13,548
I called Benjamin and asked,
"Have you left with Florence?"

422
00:29:13,660 --> 00:29:17,653
He said yes and hung up.
At least I knew.

423
00:29:19,332 --> 00:29:21,734
- What if I called him?
- You?

424
00:29:21,734 --> 00:29:25,038
I can say, "I'm a friend
of Mrs. Brochant's,

425
00:29:25,038 --> 00:29:28,241
- where can I reach her?"
- And he won't suspect a thing!

426
00:29:28,241 --> 00:29:30,743
- I'm just trying to help.
- Thanks,

427
00:29:30,743 --> 00:29:34,113
but she's not with him.
I need rest.

428
00:29:34,113 --> 00:29:36,149
I won't insist.

429
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:40,142
Good night!

430
00:29:42,055 --> 00:29:46,048
- Mr. Pignon?
- Yes?

431
00:29:46,092 --> 00:29:49,996
If I tell you exactly what to say,
could you do it?

432
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:53,989
Sometimes I feel like
you think I'm an idiot.

433
00:29:54,434 --> 00:29:57,603
Of course I can!
What do I say?

434
00:29:57,603 --> 00:30:00,106
We could use
the book they wrote.

435
00:30:00,106 --> 00:30:02,976
Tell him you're
a movie producer.

436
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:05,378
You've read the book and
want the movie rights.

437
00:30:05,378 --> 00:30:06,713
Good idea!

438
00:30:06,713 --> 00:30:10,149
Then casually, you ask
about his co-author.

439
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:13,119
- What co-author?
- My wife!

440
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:16,756
- He wrote it with her!
- Right. I'm sorry.

441
00:30:16,756 --> 00:30:19,292
- It'll never work!
- It will!

442
00:30:19,292 --> 00:30:22,295
- It's not easy, but I got it.
- Not easy?

443
00:30:22,295 --> 00:30:25,465
You're a producer, okay?
You have a company in Paris.

444
00:30:25,465 --> 00:30:27,734
No, he knows everybody here.
Foreign.

445
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,203
American? German?

446
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:32,672
Belgian! That's it!

447
00:30:32,672 --> 00:30:35,475
- Why Belgian?
- It suits you.

448
00:30:35,475 --> 00:30:39,468
You're a Belgian producer, you read
"The Merry-Go-Round,"

449
00:30:39,645 --> 00:30:42,148
and want to buy
the movie rights, okay?

450
00:30:42,148 --> 00:30:46,141
- Is it a good book?
- It's awful. Why?

451
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,821
- It bothers me.
- Why?

452
00:30:48,821 --> 00:30:52,814
If it's awful,
why do I want the rights?

453
00:30:54,327 --> 00:30:56,796
Mr. Pignon?
You're not a producer, are you?

454
00:30:56,796 --> 00:30:58,064
No.

455
00:30:58,064 --> 00:30:59,766
- You're not Belgian, either?
- No.

456
00:30:59,766 --> 00:31:03,759
So you're not calling about the
book, you're calling about my wife!

457
00:31:06,272 --> 00:31:09,475
That's tricky,
but clever as hell!

458
00:31:09,475 --> 00:31:12,812
- What's his number?
- 01.47.45...

459
00:31:12,812 --> 00:31:15,715
never mind, I'll dial it.

460
00:31:15,715 --> 00:31:19,519
- His name is Juste Leblanc.
- He has no first name?

461
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:23,512
I told you, Juste Leblanc.

462
00:31:25,324 --> 00:31:29,317
Leblanc's his name,
Juste his first name.

463
00:31:31,064 --> 00:31:35,057
Mr. Pignon, your first
name's Franois.

464
00:31:35,334 --> 00:31:39,327
Just think his is Juste.

465
00:31:39,472 --> 00:31:41,774
We're wasting time.

466
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:44,544
My wife wrote under
her maiden name, Le Guirrec.

467
00:31:44,544 --> 00:31:47,146
She's from Brittany?

468
00:31:47,146 --> 00:31:50,349
- Please, stay focused!
- Sorry.

469
00:31:50,349 --> 00:31:53,486
At the end, ask him

470
00:31:53,486 --> 00:31:55,588
where you can contact
Christine Le Guirrec.

471
00:31:55,588 --> 00:31:57,523
I'll put on
the loudspeaker.

472
00:31:57,523 --> 00:32:01,516
- Go to it.
- With a Belgian accent?

473
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:10,369
Can I talk
to Mr. Juste Leblanc?

474
00:32:10,369 --> 00:32:11,871
Speaking.

475
00:32:11,871 --> 00:32:14,407
Good evening, Mr. Leblanc,

476
00:32:14,407 --> 00:32:17,877
George Van Brueghel here,
sorry to bother you so late.

477
00:32:17,877 --> 00:32:21,447
I'm a Belgian producer,
I just got in from Belgium,

478
00:32:21,447 --> 00:32:25,440
and I'm very interested
in your novel...

479
00:32:26,352 --> 00:32:28,888
"The Merry-Go-Round"!

480
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:32,725
I'd like to discuss buying
the movie rights.

481
00:32:32,725 --> 00:32:34,694
Is this a joke?

482
00:32:34,694 --> 00:32:37,230
Not at all, why?

483
00:32:37,230 --> 00:32:39,599
- Etienne?
- What?

484
00:32:39,599 --> 00:32:43,592
Cut it out, I know it's you.

485
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:48,330
You're mistaken. I'm not Etienne,
I'm a producer from Brussels.

486
00:32:49,542 --> 00:32:52,712
- What company?
- Sorry?

487
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:55,214
What's your company called?

488
00:32:55,214 --> 00:32:57,650
Flatland Films.

489
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:00,720
A young, but dynamic company.

490
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,724
- And you're interested in my novel?
- Very interested.

491
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:07,393
- For a movie or TV?
- A movie.

492
00:33:07,393 --> 00:33:10,696
A movie, for the big screen.

493
00:33:10,696 --> 00:33:12,832
Not the small box!

494
00:33:12,832 --> 00:33:16,836
I want to do
the screenplay myself.

495
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:19,305
No problem.

496
00:33:19,305 --> 00:33:23,298
But we're a small company
with limited budgets.

497
00:33:24,243 --> 00:33:27,246
- If you're not too greedy...
- What about my wife?

498
00:33:27,246 --> 00:33:30,850
We'll talk money later.
When can I meet you, Mr...?

499
00:33:30,850 --> 00:33:33,653
- Van Breughel...
- My wife!

500
00:33:33,653 --> 00:33:35,922
I'll call tomorrow
for a meeting.

501
00:33:35,922 --> 00:33:39,659
- Talk to you tomorrow.
- Talk to you tomorrow!

502
00:33:39,659 --> 00:33:43,652
There!
We have the rights!

503
00:33:45,731 --> 00:33:49,724
And for peanuts, I'd say!
He fell for it, he did!

504
00:33:50,002 --> 00:33:53,272
What about my wife?

505
00:33:53,272 --> 00:33:56,409
What?

506
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,678
He forgot about my wife!

507
00:33:58,678 --> 00:34:01,747
He yaps for five minutes
and forgets about my wife!

508
00:34:01,747 --> 00:34:04,250
I blew it!

509
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,553
This tops my wildest dreams!

510
00:34:07,553 --> 00:34:09,822
Indeed, I blew it.

511
00:34:09,822 --> 00:34:12,592
This is record breaking!

512
00:34:12,592 --> 00:34:14,660
- I'll call back.
- Give me that phone!

513
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:17,797
I'll say, "How can I reach
your co-author,

514
00:34:17,797 --> 00:34:20,933
- Christine Le Guirrec?"
- Give me that phone!

515
00:34:20,933 --> 00:34:24,926
Too bad, we were about
to find out.

516
00:34:25,004 --> 00:34:28,997
You'll say, "How can I reach your
co-author, Christine Le Guirrec?"

517
00:34:29,976 --> 00:34:33,279
And no more.

518
00:34:33,279 --> 00:34:36,449
...Some guy with
an appalling accent.

519
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:40,442
Van Brueghel. His company's
called Flatland Films.

520
00:34:40,586 --> 00:34:42,622
I never heard of it,
either...

521
00:34:42,622 --> 00:34:45,825
Hold on, someone's calling
on the other line.

522
00:34:45,825 --> 00:34:49,818
Sorry to disturb you,
it's Van Breughel again.

523
00:34:51,464 --> 00:34:55,468
My agent's on the other line.
I'll call you. What's your number?

524
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:59,461
01.45.90.56.03.

525
00:35:01,707 --> 00:35:03,976
- He cut me off.
- I did, you idiot!

526
00:35:03,976 --> 00:35:07,313
Idiot?

527
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,649
You gave him
my phone number!

528
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:13,642
Sure, he wants
to call me back.

529
00:35:14,287 --> 00:35:17,723
You never stop, do you?

530
00:35:17,723 --> 00:35:21,027
Sorry, I'm out of my depth.
I'm doing my best, but...

531
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:23,029
World class!

532
00:35:23,029 --> 00:35:26,932
Maybe the world champion!

533
00:35:26,932 --> 00:35:30,336
It's ringing!

534
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:32,805
It's ringing,
and he's happy!

535
00:35:32,805 --> 00:35:34,573
He's calling.
Don't we answer?

536
00:35:34,573 --> 00:35:38,566
We're out,
speak after the beep.

537
00:35:39,679 --> 00:35:40,780
Pierre, it's Juste.

538
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:44,773
I wondered about
the Belgian weirdo,

539
00:35:44,884 --> 00:35:47,520
then realized you're looking
for your wife.

540
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,357
Ask me yourself,
without the accent. Bye.

541
00:35:51,357 --> 00:35:54,894
Juste? It's me.
Where is she?

542
00:35:54,894 --> 00:35:58,887
I've waited two years for this.
But I feel sorry for you.

543
00:36:00,666 --> 00:36:02,802
Don't. Just tell me
if she's with you.

544
00:36:02,802 --> 00:36:05,538
She called
to say she'd left you.

545
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:07,106
She was very upset.

546
00:36:07,106 --> 00:36:09,842
- Did she say where she was going?
- No.

547
00:36:09,842 --> 00:36:12,878
Where could she be?

548
00:36:12,878 --> 00:36:15,715
It's painful, huh?

549
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:18,851
You know exactly how I feel.
But I've got a bad back, too!

550
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:20,519
No kidding?

551
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:24,523
You'd laugh if you saw me...
bent over, unable to move.

552
00:36:24,523 --> 00:36:26,792
You want me to stop by?

553
00:36:26,792 --> 00:36:30,785
Thanks, but I'd rather be alone.
Thanks again.

554
00:36:31,364 --> 00:36:35,357
You don't have to,
but if she calls you again...

555
00:36:36,802 --> 00:36:38,804
I'll call you, I promise.

556
00:36:38,804 --> 00:36:40,072
Thanks.

557
00:36:40,072 --> 00:36:44,065
I don't deserve
a friend like you.

558
00:36:53,986 --> 00:36:57,590
Hand me that pad, please.

559
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:01,026
Put this on the door.

560
00:37:01,026 --> 00:37:03,696
"I've taken a sedative,

561
00:37:03,696 --> 00:37:06,399
I'm asleep,

562
00:37:06,399 --> 00:37:09,034
I need to be alone tonight."

563
00:37:09,034 --> 00:37:12,471
- I hope she won't bug me!
- Shall I wait for her?

564
00:37:12,471 --> 00:37:14,640
You stay in your room,
and I'll stand guard.

565
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:18,210
- You've done enough!
- I know I goofed on the phone.

566
00:37:18,210 --> 00:37:21,647
I'm really sorry.
I truly want to help you.

567
00:37:21,647 --> 00:37:25,640
Just help me to bed.

568
00:37:55,247 --> 00:37:59,240
If you feel depressed, call me
and I'll be back in a second!

569
00:37:59,518 --> 00:38:03,511
No!

570
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:14,923
You know what I lacked most
when mine left?

571
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,503
A friend to hold my hand.

572
00:38:17,503 --> 00:38:21,496
Goodbye.

573
00:38:28,247 --> 00:38:30,649
Miss Hissister!
This is for you.

574
00:38:30,649 --> 00:38:33,085
We spoke on the phone.

575
00:38:33,085 --> 00:38:35,221
Aries, with Gemini ascending.

576
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,556
I dialed your number
by mistake.

577
00:38:37,556 --> 00:38:40,926
Then I realized
you're his girlfriend.

578
00:38:40,926 --> 00:38:43,762
- His girlfriend?
- Yes.

579
00:38:43,762 --> 00:38:47,600
Sorry I was a little confusing.
But it's very simple.

580
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:50,769
His wife left him,
but he doesn't care.

581
00:38:50,769 --> 00:38:53,706
He's asleep and
can't be disturbed.

582
00:38:53,706 --> 00:38:56,041
Got that?

583
00:38:56,041 --> 00:38:58,911
Perfectly.
I'll have a word with him!

584
00:38:58,911 --> 00:39:01,080
Marlene!

585
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,082
May I call you Marlene?

586
00:39:03,082 --> 00:39:04,316
Please.

587
00:39:04,316 --> 00:39:07,953
I haven't known him long,
but I understand him.

588
00:39:07,953 --> 00:39:10,623
So take my advice.

589
00:39:10,623 --> 00:39:13,125
- I'm listening.
- Give it time.

590
00:39:13,125 --> 00:39:15,728
His wife just left,
so don't rush in.

591
00:39:15,728 --> 00:39:18,931
Be the sensuous,
amusing mistress you are,

592
00:39:18,931 --> 00:39:22,535
all garter belts
and champagne.

593
00:39:22,535 --> 00:39:25,938
Keep on seeing him
three to four times a week,

594
00:39:25,938 --> 00:39:29,931
wait for your turn.
He'll fall when it's due.

595
00:39:30,142 --> 00:39:32,711
He said he saw me
three to four times a week?

596
00:39:32,711 --> 00:39:36,215
I felt he'd see you
every day if he could.

597
00:39:36,215 --> 00:39:40,208
So don't insist.
Go home, it's your best move.

598
00:39:42,555 --> 00:39:45,991
You're right, I won't wake him.

599
00:39:45,991 --> 00:39:48,027
Good move!

600
00:39:48,027 --> 00:39:51,730
I have the feeling he'll soon be
at your door with flowers.

601
00:39:51,730 --> 00:39:54,199
Was he taking you
to a dinner party?

602
00:39:54,199 --> 00:39:57,336
Yes. Did he mention me?

603
00:39:57,336 --> 00:40:01,329
Even if he hadn't,
I would have guessed.

604
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:05,833
Nice work!

605
00:40:10,215 --> 00:40:12,985
I saw the light was on
and figured you weren't asleep.

606
00:40:12,985 --> 00:40:16,978
- You still here?
- Thank God I am!

607
00:40:17,156 --> 00:40:18,924
- Why?
- We had a visitor.

608
00:40:18,924 --> 00:40:21,160
- Who?
- The nutcase.

609
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,662
- Marlene?
- She just left.

610
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,331
She was about
to force your door.

611
00:40:25,331 --> 00:40:29,324
You're lucky a guy called Pignon
told her "Keep out!"

612
00:40:30,069 --> 00:40:33,072
- You got rid of Marlene?
- Yes.

613
00:40:33,072 --> 00:40:35,941
I don't want to brag,
but I was pretty cool.

614
00:40:35,941 --> 00:40:39,311
I was sweet, but firm.
Got rid of her fast.

615
00:40:39,311 --> 00:40:42,147
- You won't see her again!
- That's good news.

616
00:40:42,147 --> 00:40:46,140
A pity, because
she's a real looker.

617
00:40:46,352 --> 00:40:49,989
- What does she do?
- She's a writer.

618
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:53,982
Another one?
You sleep with all your authors?

619
00:40:54,226 --> 00:40:58,219
- None of your fucking business.
- Maybe not,

620
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,866
but I think it isn't nice.

621
00:41:00,866 --> 00:41:03,002
I never cheated on my wife.

622
00:41:03,002 --> 00:41:06,639
And the Ministry of Finance
is a bunny hutch!

623
00:41:06,639 --> 00:41:10,632
Leave me alone now.

624
00:41:11,043 --> 00:41:15,036
It never ends!

625
00:41:22,788 --> 00:41:26,759
Who is it?

626
00:41:26,759 --> 00:41:30,663
It's Mr. Leblanc.

627
00:41:30,663 --> 00:41:33,899
- You came.
- I felt bad leaving you alone.

628
00:41:33,899 --> 00:41:36,702
He wasn't alone.
I took care of him.

629
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:39,872
Yes, and now
you're leaving!

630
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:41,240
I'm off.

631
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:45,233
- I'll leave my pictures with you.
- Thank you, but, no thank you.

632
00:41:45,444 --> 00:41:48,213
They're models
I make with matches.

633
00:41:48,213 --> 00:41:50,382
Here's one of my finest...

634
00:41:50,382 --> 00:41:53,018
He's not here
to talk about models.

635
00:41:53,018 --> 00:41:54,286
Sure.

636
00:41:54,286 --> 00:41:57,423
Take your photos,
I'm in no mood right now.

637
00:41:57,423 --> 00:42:00,426
- What are you up to now?
- Still writing.

638
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,094
And I've already got
a published.

639
00:42:02,094 --> 00:42:04,363
- What do you write?
- We'll talk later.

640
00:42:04,363 --> 00:42:07,833
I have bad news.
She called.

641
00:42:07,833 --> 00:42:11,070
She was torn between coming here
and making a huge mistake.

642
00:42:11,070 --> 00:42:13,806
I tried to convince her, but...

643
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:15,441
What mistake?

644
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:18,711
- Going to Meneaux's place.
- What?

645
00:42:18,711 --> 00:42:20,846
Pascal Meneaux,
from the advertising company.

646
00:42:20,846 --> 00:42:23,048
- She must be there now.
- No!

647
00:42:23,048 --> 00:42:27,052
Yes. He's wooed her for weeks,
and tonight she...

648
00:42:27,052 --> 00:42:31,045
- Aren't you done?
- I'm filing them chronologically...

649
00:42:32,825 --> 00:42:35,928
- Do that at home!
- Okay!

650
00:42:35,928 --> 00:42:37,996
Meneaux's the worst!

651
00:42:37,996 --> 00:42:40,399
That's why she went.
She's mad at you.

652
00:42:40,399 --> 00:42:43,302
That two-cent Romeo.
She's crazy!

653
00:42:43,302 --> 00:42:45,771
Mine picked a real dummy!

654
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:47,439
Get out of here!

655
00:42:47,439 --> 00:42:51,110
Good night, Mr. Brochant.

656
00:42:51,110 --> 00:42:54,413
- Where does he live?
- He has a love nest,

657
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,750
- but as to the address...
- Good night, Mr. Leblanc.

658
00:42:57,750 --> 00:43:00,919
It's very secret.
No one knows it.

659
00:43:00,919 --> 00:43:04,323
- Good night, Mr. Brochant!
- Good night!

660
00:43:04,323 --> 00:43:07,092
There must be
a way to find it!

661
00:43:07,092 --> 00:43:10,462
Meneaux had a tax audit!

662
00:43:10,462 --> 00:43:14,455
Pascal Meneaux, advertizing.
I've seen his file at the Ministry.

663
00:43:15,367 --> 00:43:19,360
My pal's on his case.
Meneaux has a love nest,

664
00:43:19,838 --> 00:43:23,375
but it's no secret.
Not to us, anyway!

665
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:27,012
Good night, Mr. Brochant!

666
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:31,005
Get him back in here!

667
00:43:36,822 --> 00:43:40,815
Mr. Brochant wants
to talk to you.

668
00:43:44,963 --> 00:43:48,333
Forgive me, Franois,
I was a little edgy.

669
00:43:48,333 --> 00:43:50,836
I admit I was
really hurt.

670
00:43:50,836 --> 00:43:53,205
I rid you of that nut,
you don't even thank me.

671
00:43:53,205 --> 00:43:55,374
You won't look
at my pictures...

672
00:43:55,374 --> 00:43:59,367
- Sorry. Would you like a drink?
- No, thanks.

673
00:44:00,813 --> 00:44:04,116
I'm just arranging them.
I won't bother you.

674
00:44:04,116 --> 00:44:06,485
You're no bother at all.

675
00:44:06,485 --> 00:44:09,288
He does amazing things
with matches!

676
00:44:09,288 --> 00:44:10,489
He does?

677
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:12,624
This was my first...
343 matches.

678
00:44:12,624 --> 00:44:16,128
- Pretty rudimentary.
- But promising.

679
00:44:16,128 --> 00:44:20,121
- You haven't seen anything yet!
- Could you get us that address?

680
00:44:20,532 --> 00:44:22,467
I'd have to call Cheval,
and I'd hate to.

681
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:25,571
He's watching soccer on TV.

682
00:44:25,571 --> 00:44:28,340
- An oil derrick.
- Superb. Did you see that?

683
00:44:28,340 --> 00:44:29,541
Yes.

684
00:44:29,541 --> 00:44:31,543
Know what I called it?

685
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:35,013
"Beau Derrick."
After the actress Bo Derek!

686
00:44:35,013 --> 00:44:36,915
Beau Derrick, Bo Derek!

687
00:44:36,915 --> 00:44:39,251
We had such a laugh
at the office!

688
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:43,244
My wife is with a deadly sex-fiend!
Please call Cheval!

689
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,492
- Let's wait till half time.
- Why?

690
00:44:47,492 --> 00:44:51,485
If the game's dicey, he'll tell me
to buzz off. Wait for half time.

691
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:55,968
- When is that?
- Soon. We'd best watch the game.

692
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,036
- Got a TV?
- Not for soccer games!

693
00:44:58,036 --> 00:45:00,372
- It's a big game!
- Who cares?

694
00:45:00,372 --> 00:45:04,365
Sorry. The TV's in the den.

695
00:45:08,180 --> 00:45:12,173
Go to it! Go to it!

696
00:45:15,020 --> 00:45:18,390
- He's a bit of an idiot!
- That's why I invited him.

697
00:45:18,390 --> 00:45:21,693
- Is he the guy...?
- Yes! It's awful!

698
00:45:21,693 --> 00:45:23,996
No kidding!
He's your dinner idiot?

699
00:45:23,996 --> 00:45:27,989
I've had it!

700
00:45:28,066 --> 00:45:31,503
- It's not funny!
- Sorry, but you with a bad back

701
00:45:31,503 --> 00:45:35,496
and a broken heart,
stuck with this...

702
00:45:36,074 --> 00:45:37,342
Stop it!

703
00:45:37,342 --> 00:45:40,712
When she said she'd left you,
I didn't laugh.

704
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:44,705
But seeing you
with that jerk...

705
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:53,392
Don't move.

706
00:45:53,392 --> 00:45:56,662
Nice!

707
00:45:56,662 --> 00:45:58,430
Pignon!

708
00:45:58,430 --> 00:46:02,423
Coming!

709
00:46:05,037 --> 00:46:07,372
They scored!
Half time's in a min...

710
00:46:07,372 --> 00:46:11,365
- She's come home!
- Franois Pignon, Marlene.

711
00:46:13,645 --> 00:46:15,714
Who did you toss out earlier?

712
00:46:15,714 --> 00:46:17,950
- Marlene.
- What?

713
00:46:17,950 --> 00:46:21,943
This is Marlene.
Who did you toss out?

714
00:46:22,487 --> 00:46:24,222
If this is so funny,
get out!

715
00:46:24,222 --> 00:46:25,757
Sorry.

716
00:46:25,757 --> 00:46:29,061
A blonde in a beige raincoat?

717
00:46:29,061 --> 00:46:32,064
You said,
"That nut will show up!"

718
00:46:32,064 --> 00:46:34,533
A woman shows up,
I figure it's the nut!

719
00:46:34,533 --> 00:46:37,135
What nut?

720
00:46:37,135 --> 00:46:40,739
I'll be back.

721
00:46:40,739 --> 00:46:42,574
What did you say to her?

722
00:46:42,574 --> 00:46:44,743
- To whom?
- To my wife!

723
00:46:44,743 --> 00:46:46,979
Not a thing.

724
00:46:46,979 --> 00:46:50,382
She comes home,
and you chase her away!

725
00:46:50,382 --> 00:46:52,684
I thought she was
the nutcase.

726
00:46:52,684 --> 00:46:55,120
I thought the nympho
dumped her dogs

727
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:57,089
and came to make trouble.

728
00:46:57,089 --> 00:47:00,692
Who is he talking about?

729
00:47:00,692 --> 00:47:03,695
Please, go home!
I have a serious problem!

730
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:07,432
- Pierre, listen to me.
- Marlene, go away!

731
00:47:07,432 --> 00:47:11,425
I cram three dogs in my car
to come over, and you throw me out?

732
00:47:12,604 --> 00:47:14,506
Scram, before it gets nasty!

733
00:47:14,506 --> 00:47:18,499
- Leave, Marlene!
- It's the smart thing to do.

734
00:47:26,418 --> 00:47:28,553
He tossed out my wife!

735
00:47:28,553 --> 00:47:31,456
I'm really sorry.

736
00:47:31,456 --> 00:47:35,449
He drove her straight
into Meneaux's arms!

737
00:47:35,527 --> 00:47:39,520
Okay, I goofed. But anybody
would have made that mistake.

738
00:47:40,098 --> 00:47:42,501
- Get out!
- We need him.

739
00:47:42,501 --> 00:47:44,770
- Call Cheval!
- I can't stand him!

740
00:47:44,770 --> 00:47:48,763
I'm really sorry.
I wanted to help you so badly.

741
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:51,643
It's half time!
We must call Cheval!

742
00:47:51,643 --> 00:47:55,636
I'll make it up to you!
Tell me to call Cheval!

743
00:47:56,214 --> 00:47:58,583
Think of Christine!
We must save her!

744
00:47:58,583 --> 00:48:00,519
- Tell me to call Cheval!
- Tell me to!

745
00:48:00,519 --> 00:48:04,512
- Tell him to call Cheval.
- Tell me to!

746
00:48:06,358 --> 00:48:10,351
- Call Cheval.
- Thanks, Mr. Brochant!

747
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:14,422
Lt'll work out,
you'll see!

748
00:48:25,410 --> 00:48:27,412
Lucien, it's Franois!

749
00:48:27,412 --> 00:48:31,216
How's the big Auxerre fan?

750
00:48:31,216 --> 00:48:34,419
I'm no die-hard,
and the game's not over!

751
00:48:34,419 --> 00:48:38,412
Not over? You idiot!
Two goals down and it's not over?

752
00:48:39,658 --> 00:48:43,651
Auxerre is a team of clowns,
dickheads and fuck-offs!

753
00:48:44,830 --> 00:48:48,433
Yeah? Who got
slaughtered last week?

754
00:48:48,433 --> 00:48:51,236
Up Marseilles' ass,
ream it with class!

755
00:48:51,236 --> 00:48:55,229
- Go fuck yourself!
- You, too!

756
00:48:55,774 --> 00:48:58,777
What an asshole!

757
00:48:58,777 --> 00:49:02,770
Marseilles are turds,
Marseilles are turds!

758
00:49:04,449 --> 00:49:08,442
He's such a jerk!

759
00:49:08,653 --> 00:49:11,323
I'll call him back.

760
00:49:11,323 --> 00:49:14,693
- He's in a league of his own.
- It's been like this for hours.

761
00:49:14,693 --> 00:49:18,686
I'm calling him.
We feud, but we love each other.

762
00:49:36,815 --> 00:49:40,185
I'm calling
because I need a favor.

763
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:43,188
- Okay, on one condition.
- What?

764
00:49:43,188 --> 00:49:46,525
- Shout, "Go Marseilles, go!"
- What?

765
00:49:46,525 --> 00:49:50,518
Let me hear you shout,
"Go, Marseilles, go!"

766
00:49:51,496 --> 00:49:53,665
You must!

767
00:49:53,665 --> 00:49:57,658
"Go, Marseilles, go!"

768
00:50:05,677 --> 00:50:09,670
I'm doing this
for you, Pierre.

769
00:50:11,683 --> 00:50:13,785
You must need a big favor.

770
00:50:13,785 --> 00:50:16,254
- It's important.
- Go on.

771
00:50:16,254 --> 00:50:19,324
You're on
the Pascal Meneaux case?

772
00:50:19,324 --> 00:50:20,559
Affirmative.

773
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:23,195
He has a love nest in Paris
and I need the address.

774
00:50:23,195 --> 00:50:26,765
You're not his type!

775
00:50:26,765 --> 00:50:28,366
What?

776
00:50:28,366 --> 00:50:32,359
He likes big boobs
and hates hairy legs!

777
00:50:36,308 --> 00:50:40,301
He's so funny!

778
00:50:40,845 --> 00:50:43,415
It's serious.
I need that address.

779
00:50:43,415 --> 00:50:45,517
Why do you need it?

780
00:50:45,517 --> 00:50:48,653
It's for a friend
who thinks his wife is there.

781
00:50:48,653 --> 00:50:52,646
At Meneaux's?
His wife's there? Poor bastard!

782
00:50:52,857 --> 00:50:56,628
- See why I need the address?
- You bet!

783
00:50:56,628 --> 00:50:58,530
I've watched Meneaux!

784
00:50:58,530 --> 00:51:00,899
Any skirt drives him dingo!

785
00:51:00,899 --> 00:51:04,892
Talk about a pig!
Talk about a pig!

786
00:51:05,237 --> 00:51:07,305
- That's enough!
- That's enough!

787
00:51:07,305 --> 00:51:09,441
Do I know this poor sap?

788
00:51:09,441 --> 00:51:11,776
I doubt it.
Ever had a tax audit?

789
00:51:11,776 --> 00:51:12,944
No.

790
00:51:12,944 --> 00:51:16,414
- No. What's the address?
- I can't tell you now.

791
00:51:16,414 --> 00:51:19,317
- I'll get it tomorrow!
- That'll be too late!

792
00:51:19,317 --> 00:51:22,354
It's urgent.
It's a personal favor.

793
00:51:22,354 --> 00:51:24,556
Can you go over
to the Ministry now?

794
00:51:24,556 --> 00:51:26,758
Now? What about the game?

795
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,261
Tape it.
We'll watch it together.

796
00:51:29,261 --> 00:51:32,297
I'm already taping
the ice-skating show for my wife!

797
00:51:32,297 --> 00:51:36,290
We'll tape the game!
Go there for me!

798
00:51:36,701 --> 00:51:39,571
You're a pain!
I haven't eaten yet!

799
00:51:39,571 --> 00:51:41,706
- We'll feed him.
- You're invited here.

800
00:51:41,706 --> 00:51:43,575
I don't know your sap!

801
00:51:43,575 --> 00:51:47,568
He's a great guy.
Hop over to the Ministry for me.

802
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:50,081
You're a drag!

803
00:51:50,081 --> 00:51:54,074
I did say,
"Go, Marseilles, go!"

804
00:51:54,953 --> 00:51:56,454
What's the address?

805
00:51:56,454 --> 00:51:59,557
9 University St, 6th floor,
on the left.

806
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:02,560
- I'll be right over.
- See ya.

807
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,464
We got it, Mr. Sap...
I mean, Mr. Brochant.

808
00:52:06,464 --> 00:52:10,457
It wasn't easy,
but we got it!

809
00:52:10,669 --> 00:52:13,938
- You okay?
- Much better. The pills helped.

810
00:52:13,938 --> 00:52:16,741
We've got to tape
the game for that retard.

811
00:52:16,741 --> 00:52:19,911
Cheval's no retard.
He's our best inspector.

812
00:52:19,911 --> 00:52:23,904
Let him loose in this apartment,
and he'll strip it!

813
00:52:27,952 --> 00:52:31,945
It might not be a good idea to let
a tax inspector into your home!

814
00:52:56,448 --> 00:52:58,350
You told him
I was your friend!

815
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:02,087
- He wouldn't go to work on me!
- Cheval would audit his own mother!

816
00:53:02,087 --> 00:53:05,056
Is that a copy?

817
00:53:05,056 --> 00:53:07,926
If you're clean,
if your artworks

818
00:53:07,926 --> 00:53:10,028
were declared,
you'll be fine.

819
00:53:10,028 --> 00:53:12,130
What'll we feed him?

820
00:53:12,130 --> 00:53:14,766
I've got frozen stuff
and eggs.

821
00:53:14,766 --> 00:53:18,759
I'll make him
a nice omelet!

822
00:53:20,038 --> 00:53:23,007
- Give me a hand.
- Watch your back.

823
00:53:23,007 --> 00:53:27,000
- Where do we put it?
- We'll put everything in my room.

824
00:53:28,046 --> 00:53:29,981
Stop laughing!

825
00:53:29,981 --> 00:53:33,585
That idiot managed
to drive your wife to adultery

826
00:53:33,585 --> 00:53:37,578
and to get you audited!

827
00:54:11,022 --> 00:54:13,558
- What's that wine?
- Lafitte Rothschild '78.

828
00:54:13,558 --> 00:54:15,527
Don't serve him
such expensive wine!

829
00:54:15,527 --> 00:54:17,929
- That's all I have.
- No table wine?

830
00:54:17,929 --> 00:54:19,197
No!

831
00:54:19,197 --> 00:54:22,534
I've worked like a dog so
I wouldn't have to drink cheap wine!

832
00:54:22,534 --> 00:54:24,803
I only have great wines!
Or water!

833
00:54:24,803 --> 00:54:27,872
- Does Cheval know about wine?
- You bet he does!

834
00:54:27,872 --> 00:54:30,708
You opened a fine bottle.
He'll like that!

835
00:54:30,708 --> 00:54:32,477
Hear that?
We've got a problem!

836
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:36,470
I'll solve it.
Just you wait!

837
00:54:41,886 --> 00:54:45,490
- It has aroma.
- What are you doing?

838
00:54:45,490 --> 00:54:49,483
I'm putting vinegar in my Lafitte.
Now we have cheap wine.

839
00:54:50,528 --> 00:54:54,466
There! A wino's delight!

840
00:54:54,466 --> 00:54:57,001
- Taste it!
- You taste it!

841
00:54:57,001 --> 00:55:00,994
No, thanks.

842
00:55:03,875 --> 00:55:07,868
Weird...
it has more body.

843
00:55:12,183 --> 00:55:16,176
- Damn!
- It hasn't ruined it.

844
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:19,190
- I'd say it's better.
- Definitely.

845
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:23,183
Let me try.

846
00:55:23,528 --> 00:55:27,521
Right.
That's good to know!

847
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:34,061
That should do it!

848
00:55:35,907 --> 00:55:39,900
- No!
- Yes!

849
00:55:47,886 --> 00:55:51,589
- Where's the bathroom?
- Over there.

850
00:55:51,589 --> 00:55:55,582
Perfect!

851
00:55:58,296 --> 00:55:59,898
Cheval.

852
00:55:59,898 --> 00:56:03,891
6th floor, on the left.

853
00:56:07,939 --> 00:56:10,341
- You okay?
- Yes.

854
00:56:10,341 --> 00:56:13,711
- Here he is!
- I'll get it.

855
00:56:13,711 --> 00:56:17,704
You're giving him that
to drink?

856
00:56:18,616 --> 00:56:21,753
Lucien Cheval.
Pierre Brochant, Juste Leblanc.

857
00:56:21,753 --> 00:56:23,221
Mr. Cheval, thank you for...

858
00:56:23,221 --> 00:56:26,658
- Don't tell me!
- What?

859
00:56:26,658 --> 00:56:28,593
The soccer score.

860
00:56:28,593 --> 00:56:31,062
All I can say
is that it's a tie.

861
00:56:31,062 --> 00:56:34,065
- Really?
- No, I was kidding!

862
00:56:34,065 --> 00:56:36,801
What an idiot!

863
00:56:36,801 --> 00:56:40,071
Isn't he an idiot?

864
00:56:40,071 --> 00:56:44,064
You should have seen
the look on your face!

865
00:56:44,876 --> 00:56:47,979
He's so happy now!
I made his evening!

866
00:56:47,979 --> 00:56:50,682
We're in a hurry.
You got the address?

867
00:56:50,682 --> 00:56:53,351
- He's the man I told you about.
- Yes, the...

868
00:56:53,351 --> 00:56:56,120
- Right.
- The address is in here.

869
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,622
I'm starving.

870
00:56:57,622 --> 00:57:01,615
I made you a nice omelet.
You'll love it!

871
00:57:03,094 --> 00:57:06,831
- Am I the only one eating?
- Yes. So where's this love nest?

872
00:57:06,831 --> 00:57:10,824
I audited a Michel Brochant
three years ago.

873
00:57:11,269 --> 00:57:14,138
- Are you related?
- Could be.

874
00:57:14,138 --> 00:57:17,342
- Where does he live?
- In jail. He got five years.

875
00:57:17,342 --> 00:57:19,611
Nice guy.

876
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:23,604
Had a fancy place like yours,
that we auctioned off!

877
00:57:26,317 --> 00:57:30,310
Where's that fuck nest?

878
00:57:31,122 --> 00:57:34,425
Let me look through
all this stuff!

879
00:57:34,425 --> 00:57:38,418
Advertising is
quite lucrative!

880
00:57:38,796 --> 00:57:41,299
What's your thing,
Mr. Brochant?

881
00:57:41,299 --> 00:57:43,968
Publishing.

882
00:57:43,968 --> 00:57:45,837
Very profitable, too!

883
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:49,830
Please, the address.

884
00:57:52,777 --> 00:57:55,947
St. James St...
that's his home address.

885
00:57:55,947 --> 00:57:59,940
- Where is that love nest?
- Here's your omelet!

886
00:58:00,818 --> 00:58:04,811
Thanks, Franois.

887
00:58:08,860 --> 00:58:11,763
An good little table wine.
A bit coarse,

888
00:58:11,763 --> 00:58:15,756
but I get it for cheap.

889
00:58:17,068 --> 00:58:21,061
Let's try this omelet.

890
00:58:25,810 --> 00:58:27,245
What's wrong?

891
00:58:27,245 --> 00:58:29,347
A masterpiece, Franois!

892
00:58:29,347 --> 00:58:32,083
He's so silly.
Thanks, Lucien.

893
00:58:32,083 --> 00:58:34,786
Light, unctuous...

894
00:58:34,786 --> 00:58:37,488
My secret's a few drops
of beer in the eggs...

895
00:58:37,488 --> 00:58:40,758
The address, damn it!

896
00:58:40,758 --> 00:58:44,462
Lincoln St...
that's his office...

897
00:58:44,462 --> 00:58:46,364
Temple St...

898
00:58:46,364 --> 00:58:50,001
that's not it either.

899
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:53,137
You been attached?

900
00:58:53,137 --> 00:58:54,706
No, why?

901
00:58:54,706 --> 00:58:58,509
Those light patches...
paintings have been removed.

902
00:58:58,509 --> 00:59:02,502
He doesn't miss a trick!
You're fabulous, Lucien!

903
00:59:04,215 --> 00:59:06,384
You came to help
or audit him?

904
00:59:06,384 --> 00:59:09,053
He came to help! Right?

905
00:59:09,053 --> 00:59:12,356
Hurry! Poor Mr. Brochant
is in a fix!

906
00:59:12,356 --> 00:59:14,892
Yeah, poor Mr. Brochant...

907
00:59:14,892 --> 00:59:17,361
Sure, Meneaux's
quite the jerk,

908
00:59:17,361 --> 00:59:21,354
but as we say,
"dogs only go for bitches!"

909
00:59:24,402 --> 00:59:28,406
Here we are. Barrs St.
Near the park.

910
00:59:28,406 --> 00:59:30,508
37 Barrs St.

911
00:59:30,508 --> 00:59:32,110
- In Neuilly.
- Great!

912
00:59:32,110 --> 00:59:34,779
- I'm off.
- Wait, make sure she's there!

913
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:37,348
Don't go till
you're sure of it.

914
00:59:37,348 --> 00:59:40,118
He won't open the door.
He's sneaky.

915
00:59:40,118 --> 00:59:44,111
- I'll kick it open.
- What if she's not there?

916
00:59:45,223 --> 00:59:47,358
- Then what?
- We could call him.

917
00:59:47,358 --> 00:59:51,351
To ask if my wife's in his bed,
snug under his quilt?

918
00:59:51,996 --> 00:59:55,989
- Under his quilt!
- Are you done?

919
01:00:08,279 --> 01:00:11,916
You had a knickknack there!

920
01:00:11,916 --> 01:00:14,218
I can see the dust ring.

921
01:00:14,218 --> 01:00:16,387
I told you,
he's a real pro.

922
01:00:16,387 --> 01:00:19,524
- Bravo, Lucien!
- You'll make me blush.

923
01:00:19,524 --> 01:00:22,360
Don't be so modest!
You've busted many others!

924
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,196
We've got the address.
Kick 'em out!

925
01:00:25,196 --> 01:00:27,498
Stop it, please!

926
01:00:27,498 --> 01:00:30,501
I've got an idea.
Listen to this.

927
01:00:30,501 --> 01:00:33,871
We scare Meneaux
to make him come clean.

928
01:00:33,871 --> 01:00:34,972
How?

929
01:00:34,972 --> 01:00:37,275
You call and say
you know everything,

930
01:00:37,275 --> 01:00:41,212
you're coming to wreck his place
with three tough guys.

931
01:00:41,212 --> 01:00:42,280
Not bad.

932
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:45,449
We'll know right away
by the way he reacts.

933
01:00:45,449 --> 01:00:48,252
A fine strategy!

934
01:00:48,252 --> 01:00:51,255
I can't call him.
He knows my voice!

935
01:00:51,255 --> 01:00:55,248
- He knows mine, too.
- And mine. I'm with him all day.

936
01:01:00,898 --> 01:01:04,035
I think I'm going
to be needed!

937
01:01:04,035 --> 01:01:06,237
- Oh, no!
- Only he can do it!

938
01:01:06,237 --> 01:01:08,639
I really feel up to it!

939
01:01:08,639 --> 01:01:10,942
We'll coach him,
and he'll do fine.

940
01:01:10,942 --> 01:01:14,645
- Just wait and see!
- If you don't want me to help...

941
01:01:14,645 --> 01:01:17,048
But who would tell us
to call him?

942
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:21,041
Someone who'd have
the number to his love nest.

943
01:01:21,319 --> 01:01:25,089
His partner, Roussin, would.
They're very close.

944
01:01:25,089 --> 01:01:26,858
Roussin it is.

945
01:01:26,858 --> 01:01:29,260
Why wouldn't he
call himself?

946
01:01:29,260 --> 01:01:32,096
Why wouldn't Roussin call?
Lt'll seem odd.

947
01:01:32,096 --> 01:01:36,089
Meneaux told me
he's heading to LA tonight.

948
01:01:36,634 --> 01:01:40,371
Perfect! We're calling for Roussin
who's on a plane.

949
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:41,672
Great!

950
01:01:41,672 --> 01:01:44,942
- Got the strategy?
- It's simple.

951
01:01:44,942 --> 01:01:48,935
He has to rehearse! A lot!
One hell of a lot!

952
01:01:49,947 --> 01:01:53,584
Sit down. Repeat after me,

953
01:01:53,584 --> 01:01:56,254
"I'm calling
for Mr. Roussin.

954
01:01:56,254 --> 01:01:59,323
He's on a plane,
but has a message for you."

955
01:01:59,323 --> 01:02:01,058
- Okay.
- No, repeat it.

956
01:02:01,058 --> 01:02:03,561
Pretend I'm Meneaux and
repeat what I said.

957
01:02:03,561 --> 01:02:07,265
- I've got it!
- Please, repeat precisely.

958
01:02:07,265 --> 01:02:11,258
"Hello, I'm calling
for Mr. Roussin.

959
01:02:12,336 --> 01:02:15,206
He's on a plane,
and has a message for you."

960
01:02:15,206 --> 01:02:17,108
- Perfect!
- Not yet.

961
01:02:17,108 --> 01:02:18,976
You add,
"Brochant knows everything."

962
01:02:18,976 --> 01:02:22,969
- No, repeat it!
- Come on, he's not stupid!

963
01:02:24,448 --> 01:02:28,286
"Brochant knows everything."

964
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,956
Then you say,
"He knows about his wife."

965
01:02:31,956 --> 01:02:34,225
If Meneaux asks
who's speaking, you say,

966
01:02:34,225 --> 01:02:38,218
"A friend of Roussin's.
Brochant's coming with three pals."

967
01:02:40,698 --> 01:02:44,691
"He's with three
of his toughest pals."

968
01:02:46,037 --> 01:02:49,173
- He's talented!
- I'm just parroting.

969
01:02:49,173 --> 01:02:52,410
- He's excellent!
- Could I improvise a bit?

970
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,045
No!

971
01:02:54,045 --> 01:02:56,213
Don't shout!
You scared me!

972
01:02:56,213 --> 01:02:58,516
Just stick
to what I told you!

973
01:02:58,516 --> 01:03:01,352
Come on,
we're wasting time!

974
01:03:01,352 --> 01:03:05,356
What's the number?

975
01:03:05,356 --> 01:03:09,349
01.47.47.39.63.

976
01:03:12,697 --> 01:03:15,366
- Here we go!
- I'm scared.

977
01:03:15,366 --> 01:03:19,036
- The strategy's fine.
- I'm worried about the executor.

978
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:23,029
- It's ringing!
- Loudspeaker!

979
01:03:24,375 --> 01:03:28,368
Hopefully,
they haven't done it yet.

980
01:03:31,048 --> 01:03:35,041
- Why is he not answering?
- He's too busy!

981
01:03:39,724 --> 01:03:41,993
- Pascal Meneaux?
- Yes.

982
01:03:41,993 --> 01:03:45,986
He sounds tired.
That's bad.

983
01:03:46,030 --> 01:03:47,732
That's a bad sign.

984
01:03:47,732 --> 01:03:50,368
Sorry to bother you.

985
01:03:50,368 --> 01:03:53,771
I'm calling on behalf
of Mr. Roussin.

986
01:03:53,771 --> 01:03:54,772
Yes?

987
01:03:54,772 --> 01:03:58,109
He's on a plane,
but he has a message for you.

988
01:03:58,109 --> 01:03:59,543
Go ahead.

989
01:03:59,543 --> 01:04:02,079
- Brochant knows everything.
- What?

990
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:04,382
He's coming
to wreck your place!

991
01:04:04,382 --> 01:04:05,583
Nice going.

992
01:04:05,583 --> 01:04:07,451
Who is this?

993
01:04:07,451 --> 01:04:09,720
A friend of Roussin's.

994
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,655
Brochant's coming over,
and not alone.

995
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:15,259
He's with three
of his toughest pals.

996
01:04:15,259 --> 01:04:17,428
He's crazy!
His wife's not here!

997
01:04:17,428 --> 01:04:20,097
You're not with her?

998
01:04:20,097 --> 01:04:22,266
She canceled out.

999
01:04:22,266 --> 01:04:26,259
Roussin said,
"He's with Mrs. Brochant."

1000
01:04:26,637 --> 01:04:30,630
Not at all. I'm with the wife
of guy who's auditing me!

1001
01:04:34,612 --> 01:04:36,414
What?

1002
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,582
The jerk's hounded me
for months.

1003
01:04:38,582 --> 01:04:42,575
I'm screwing his wife,
not Mrs. Brochant!

1004
01:04:47,258 --> 01:04:49,727
May I use your phone?

1005
01:04:49,727 --> 01:04:53,720
Certainly.

1006
01:04:55,433 --> 01:04:58,769
She went shopping
this afternoon.

1007
01:04:58,769 --> 01:05:02,762
I asked her to take a form
to Meneaux's office.

1008
01:05:03,607 --> 01:05:07,600
And bingo!

1009
01:05:08,279 --> 01:05:10,614
Good evening, Mr. Meneaux.

1010
01:05:10,614 --> 01:05:14,151
Could I speak
to Mrs. Cheval, please?

1011
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:16,454
You know who I am.

1012
01:05:16,454 --> 01:05:19,223
We're meeting tomorrow
at 9:00, as usual.

1013
01:05:19,223 --> 01:05:21,292
We'll review
your whole case.

1014
01:05:21,292 --> 01:05:25,285
Now let me speak
to my wife.

1015
01:05:25,563 --> 01:05:28,099
Charlotte?
Don't try to explain.

1016
01:05:28,099 --> 01:05:31,635
Leave that place at once!

1017
01:05:31,635 --> 01:05:35,628
Of course you can put
your clothes back on!

1018
01:05:37,875 --> 01:05:40,578
I'm not alone.

1019
01:05:40,578 --> 01:05:43,380
I can't talk now.
We'll talk at home.

1020
01:05:43,380 --> 01:05:45,216
Charlotte!

1021
01:05:45,216 --> 01:05:49,209
I did tape the ice-skating
show for you.

1022
01:05:58,329 --> 01:05:59,797
That wine...

1023
01:05:59,797 --> 01:06:01,732
It is a bit coarse.

1024
01:06:01,732 --> 01:06:05,669
- I'm going to puke! The bathroom!
- Here, Lucien!

1025
01:06:05,669 --> 01:06:09,662
First door on the left!

1026
01:06:18,749 --> 01:06:22,742
I said "on the left."

1027
01:06:24,288 --> 01:06:26,490
Interesting room!

1028
01:06:26,490 --> 01:06:30,483
A storage room,
where I keep my old things.

1029
01:06:31,529 --> 01:06:34,532
- It's awful, but I don't care!
- What is?

1030
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:36,834
He's a tax dodger,
and I don't care!

1031
01:06:36,834 --> 01:06:40,827
Get a hold of yourself.
Run home and take a shower.

1032
01:06:41,906 --> 01:06:45,899
- Want the tape of the soccer game?
- I'm in no mood for that.

1033
01:06:48,245 --> 01:06:50,514
- Goodbye, Mr. Leblanc.
- Goodbye, Mr. Cheval.

1034
01:06:50,514 --> 01:06:53,350
- Goodbye, Mr. Brochant.
- Thanks for all your help.

1035
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:55,819
Don't mention it.
We'll meet again soon.

1036
01:06:55,819 --> 01:06:59,812
I'm going to audit you.
All this is suspect.

1037
01:07:03,694 --> 01:07:07,687
He recovered pretty fast!

1038
01:07:22,713 --> 01:07:25,549
- Where can she be?
- I'll go home.

1039
01:07:25,549 --> 01:07:28,686
- If she calls, I'll call.
- Thanks.

1040
01:07:28,686 --> 01:07:32,690
- Goodbye, Mr. Pignon.
- Goodbye.

1041
01:07:32,690 --> 01:07:34,525
Is everyone leaving?

1042
01:07:34,525 --> 01:07:38,518
Yes, you can leave too.

1043
01:07:41,398 --> 01:07:42,733
Yes?

1044
01:07:42,733 --> 01:07:44,468
Speaking.

1045
01:07:44,468 --> 01:07:48,461
I'm her husband.
Is something wrong?

1046
01:07:50,674 --> 01:07:53,611
Which hospital?
I'm coming!

1047
01:07:53,611 --> 01:07:56,046
She had a car accident.
She's at the hospital.

1048
01:07:56,046 --> 01:07:58,716
- Is it serious?
- Just a concussion,

1049
01:07:58,716 --> 01:08:02,386
- but they're keeping her overnight.
- I could drive you.

1050
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:06,379
No, thanks.

1051
01:08:24,708 --> 01:08:27,911
Pierre, it's me.

1052
01:08:27,911 --> 01:08:30,080
I know you're there.

1053
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:32,916
You're not being nice.

1054
01:08:32,916 --> 01:08:36,909
You promised to leave your wife.
Look how you treat me now!

1055
01:08:38,322 --> 01:08:42,315
Answer me!
I need you. I'm not well!

1056
01:08:44,461 --> 01:08:46,597
Pick up the phone!

1057
01:08:46,597 --> 01:08:49,466
If you don't,
I'll do something silly!

1058
01:08:49,466 --> 01:08:53,103
His wife had an accident.
He's at the hospital.

1059
01:08:53,103 --> 01:08:56,106
- An accident?
- It's not serious, but...

1060
01:08:56,106 --> 01:08:59,677
- Serves him right!
- Don't say that, Marlene.

1061
01:08:59,677 --> 01:09:01,779
Serves him right!
He's mean!

1062
01:09:01,779 --> 01:09:05,449
His wife's in the hospital,
and I'll kill myself.

1063
01:09:05,449 --> 01:09:09,442
Don't kill yourself.
Try to understand, it's been hell...

1064
01:09:10,954 --> 01:09:13,657
He's a bastard!

1065
01:09:13,657 --> 01:09:17,650
Fuck, my glass...
look at that mess.

1066
01:09:18,128 --> 01:09:22,099
Why did I fall
for that bastard?

1067
01:09:22,099 --> 01:09:24,568
Sorry, I have to hang up.

1068
01:09:24,568 --> 01:09:27,638
Don't hang up!

1069
01:09:27,638 --> 01:09:30,607
Talk to me.
It makes me feel better.

1070
01:09:30,607 --> 01:09:32,109
Hang up!

1071
01:09:32,109 --> 01:09:35,112
- She's suicidal.
- It's blackmail.

1072
01:09:35,112 --> 01:09:36,780
Where are my keys?

1073
01:09:36,780 --> 01:09:40,773
Don't do anything silly!
Swear you won't!

1074
01:09:41,852 --> 01:09:45,845
You're nice.
But he's a bastard!

1075
01:09:47,124 --> 01:09:49,960
One hell of a bastard!

1076
01:09:49,960 --> 01:09:51,995
Don't say that.

1077
01:09:51,995 --> 01:09:55,988
He's so mean!
Even in his way of having fun!

1078
01:09:56,066 --> 01:09:57,568
I have to go.

1079
01:09:57,568 --> 01:10:01,561
If he hadn't hurt his back,
he'd be making fun of some guy.

1080
01:10:02,973 --> 01:10:05,008
What do you mean?

1081
01:10:05,008 --> 01:10:06,844
Hang up!

1082
01:10:06,844 --> 01:10:09,847
Didn't he tell you?

1083
01:10:09,847 --> 01:10:13,784
Every week, they hold
a dinner game.

1084
01:10:13,784 --> 01:10:17,777
They invite idiots and
make fun of them all night!

1085
01:10:28,065 --> 01:10:32,058
Let's go!

1086
01:10:32,836 --> 01:10:34,972
Your briefcase.

1087
01:10:34,972 --> 01:10:37,207
Quick.
I'm in a hurry.

1088
01:10:37,207 --> 01:10:41,200
- Mr. Brochant.
- Yes?

1089
01:10:41,779 --> 01:10:44,715
What was tonight's
dinner for?

1090
01:10:44,715 --> 01:10:46,683
For friends
who admired your work!

1091
01:10:46,683 --> 01:10:49,686
- Let's go!
- Were there other guests?

1092
01:10:49,686 --> 01:10:52,489
Let's talk in the elevator.

1093
01:10:52,489 --> 01:10:55,726
What kind of guests?

1094
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:58,462
Why these questions?

1095
01:10:58,462 --> 01:11:02,032
How do you pick your guests?

1096
01:11:02,032 --> 01:11:05,769
Get to the point.

1097
01:11:05,769 --> 01:11:09,762
Was I invited
to your dinner for idiots?

1098
01:11:20,951 --> 01:11:23,253
It's you, darling.
I was just leaving.

1099
01:11:23,253 --> 01:11:26,690
How are you?

1100
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,859
What do you mean?

1101
01:11:28,859 --> 01:11:32,852
I love you, and
I won't leave you alone!

1102
01:11:33,931 --> 01:11:36,500
I've learned a lot tonight.

1103
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:40,504
I need you!

1104
01:11:40,504 --> 01:11:42,973
To hell with her!

1105
01:11:42,973 --> 01:11:46,966
She's not my girlfriend!
That retard made it up!

1106
01:11:48,045 --> 01:11:52,038
I'm coming.
We'll talk it over, okay?

1107
01:12:00,224 --> 01:12:03,927
The retard is leaving.
But first, answer this:

1108
01:12:03,927 --> 01:12:07,920
Did you invite me
to a dinner for idiots?

1109
01:12:12,569 --> 01:12:14,671
Look, in one evening,

1110
01:12:14,671 --> 01:12:18,664
you've avenged all the idiots
who ever attended our dinners.

1111
01:12:19,943 --> 01:12:22,679
Good night, Mr. Pignon.

1112
01:12:22,679 --> 01:12:26,550
- She's right. You're mean.
- So I'm mean!

1113
01:12:26,550 --> 01:12:30,543
My wife says it, and
everyone agrees... I'm mean.

1114
01:12:31,788 --> 01:12:34,057
You can put it
on my answering machine,

1115
01:12:34,057 --> 01:12:38,050
"Brochant is a meanie!"

1116
01:12:38,629 --> 01:12:41,331
Don't mix sedatives
and alcohol.

1117
01:12:41,331 --> 01:12:43,901
Why not?
It's the moral of the story...

1118
01:12:43,901 --> 01:12:47,905
Brochant the meanie gets drunk
alone in his big place,

1119
01:12:47,905 --> 01:12:51,898
while nice Pignon goes home saying,
"The bastard got punished!"

1120
01:12:52,576 --> 01:12:56,569
"Brochant's a meanie,
Pignon's a beanie!"

1121
01:13:02,185 --> 01:13:04,221
Now what?

1122
01:13:04,221 --> 01:13:06,256
I need the number
to the West Side Hospital.

1123
01:13:06,256 --> 01:13:10,249
He's at it again!

1124
01:13:10,561 --> 01:13:13,096
Thanks.

1125
01:13:13,096 --> 01:13:17,089
You won't get her.
It's a public hospital.

1126
01:13:18,869 --> 01:13:20,237
West Side Hospital.

1127
01:13:20,237 --> 01:13:24,230
Mrs. Christine Brochant, please.
She was in a car accident.

1128
01:13:24,341 --> 01:13:28,334
No calls for patients after 6:00 PM.
Call tomorrow.

1129
01:13:29,246 --> 01:13:33,239
- There you go!
- I must speak to Mrs. Brochant.

1130
01:13:34,251 --> 01:13:36,987
This is Pr. Sorbier.

1131
01:13:36,987 --> 01:13:39,122
Sorry, sir.
Please hold on.

1132
01:13:39,122 --> 01:13:43,115
I'm in a rush, dear.
Hurry!

1133
01:13:44,795 --> 01:13:48,788
- Mrs. Brochant for you, Professor.
- Thanks, dear.

1134
01:13:50,233 --> 01:13:54,226
Stop this farce.
She just hung up on me.

1135
01:13:56,607 --> 01:14:00,043
Pr. Sorbier for you.

1136
01:14:00,043 --> 01:14:03,714
Thanks.

1137
01:14:03,714 --> 01:14:05,782
Mrs. Brochant?

1138
01:14:05,782 --> 01:14:07,284
Yes, doctor.

1139
01:14:07,284 --> 01:14:11,277
I'm not Pr. Sorbier.

1140
01:14:12,289 --> 01:14:16,282
- Who is this?
- I'm your husband's idiot.

1141
01:14:19,162 --> 01:14:21,064
What?

1142
01:14:21,064 --> 01:14:24,034
We briefly met.
My name's Pignon,

1143
01:14:24,034 --> 01:14:28,027
I'm your husband's idiot
for that dinner.

1144
01:14:29,439 --> 01:14:31,274
I'm listening.

1145
01:14:31,274 --> 01:14:34,845
I just found out
why I was invited,

1146
01:14:34,845 --> 01:14:37,147
and I'm in a state of shock.

1147
01:14:37,147 --> 01:14:41,151
You were in a crash,
and so was I!

1148
01:14:41,151 --> 01:14:43,854
Hello?

1149
01:14:43,854 --> 01:14:45,422
Yes, I'm here.

1150
01:14:45,422 --> 01:14:48,458
I'm not calling because
I feel sorry for myself.

1151
01:14:48,458 --> 01:14:51,194
I feel sorry for him.

1152
01:14:51,194 --> 01:14:53,864
He may not be
the meanest of men,

1153
01:14:53,864 --> 01:14:56,667
but he's the unhappiest.

1154
01:14:56,667 --> 01:15:00,203
I heard you tell him
not to visit you.

1155
01:15:00,203 --> 01:15:03,206
He was so lost,
so miserable,

1156
01:15:03,206 --> 01:15:07,199
that I forgot I was the idiot
and decided to call.

1157
01:15:07,310 --> 01:15:10,047
- Mrs. Brochant?
- Yes?

1158
01:15:10,047 --> 01:15:14,040
My wife left me two years ago.
That day, my life was shattered.

1159
01:15:16,086 --> 01:15:19,356
I survived
by making my models,

1160
01:15:19,356 --> 01:15:22,859
but deep down,
I'm still a wreck.

1161
01:15:22,859 --> 01:15:26,852
I wish that on no one,
not even your husband.

1162
01:15:28,799 --> 01:15:32,169
Is he there?

1163
01:15:32,169 --> 01:15:34,037
What?

1164
01:15:34,037 --> 01:15:38,030
He's feeding you the lines
of this moving drama?

1165
01:15:38,508 --> 01:15:42,501
I swear it was my idea
to call you.

1166
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:44,715
He fed me nothing.

1167
01:15:44,715 --> 01:15:48,285
Is he beside you?

1168
01:15:48,285 --> 01:15:52,278
No, I'm in a phone booth.

1169
01:15:54,858 --> 01:15:58,851
He doesn't love me.
He loves no one.

1170
01:15:59,396 --> 01:16:01,231
Mrs. Brochant,
for two hours,

1171
01:16:01,231 --> 01:16:04,534
I saw your husband
try to find you.

1172
01:16:04,534 --> 01:16:07,070
He even called Pascal Meneaux,

1173
01:16:07,070 --> 01:16:11,063
who was in the arms
of a woman who wasn't you!

1174
01:16:12,075 --> 01:16:14,511
He called Meneaux?

1175
01:16:14,511 --> 01:16:15,879
He did.

1176
01:16:15,879 --> 01:16:18,915
You can't imagine
what he did out of love for you.

1177
01:16:18,915 --> 01:16:22,908
He made up with his best friend,
dumped his girlfriend.

1178
01:16:23,253 --> 01:16:26,923
He even braved
a tax inspector!

1179
01:16:26,923 --> 01:16:30,916
He tidied up his whole life,
in an exemplary way.

1180
01:16:31,795 --> 01:16:35,788
Now he's alone in his big apartment,
mixing alcohol and pills.

1181
01:16:37,567 --> 01:16:40,170
I'm worried about him.

1182
01:16:40,170 --> 01:16:44,163
I know one can die of love,
Mrs. Brochant.

1183
01:16:46,443 --> 01:16:50,436
I'll think it over.
Thanks for calling.

1184
01:16:51,982 --> 01:16:54,050
Don't mention it.

1185
01:16:54,050 --> 01:16:58,043
Goodbye.

1186
01:17:00,390 --> 01:17:04,383
She'll call back.

1187
01:17:08,231 --> 01:17:10,200
- Mr. Pignon?
- Yes?

1188
01:17:10,200 --> 01:17:14,193
We're going to the next dinner.
But this time, you're taking me!

1189
01:17:14,237 --> 01:17:17,174
- And I'll win first prize.
- I'm exhausted.

1190
01:17:17,174 --> 01:17:19,910
Being smart is very tiring.

1191
01:17:19,910 --> 01:17:23,346
- I'll try it sometime.
- Promise me one thing.

1192
01:17:23,346 --> 01:17:24,581
Just ask.

1193
01:17:24,581 --> 01:17:27,450
Think twice before
you call anyone an idiot.

1194
01:17:27,450 --> 01:17:31,443
I promise. I swear.

1195
01:17:32,255 --> 01:17:34,391
Here he is,
Mrs. Brochant!

1196
01:17:34,391 --> 01:17:38,094
I thought you were
in a phone booth.

1197
01:17:38,094 --> 01:17:40,096
You idiot!

1198
01:17:40,096 --> 01:17:42,833
- No, I'm back at his place.
- What an idiot!

1199
01:17:42,833 --> 01:17:44,601
I can explain!

1200
01:17:44,601 --> 01:17:47,270
- What an idiot!
- I'll call her back!

1201
01:17:47,270 --> 01:17:51,263
- I'll call her back, it'll be fine!
- What an idiot!
