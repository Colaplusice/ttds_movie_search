YOU DESCRIBE THE DECEASED
AS "AN IMMATURE, UNSTABLE

WOULD YOU LIKE
TO CLARIFY THAT
TO THE INQUIRY?

Man: LISTEN, MAN,
YOU HAD THE DECEASED
IN YOUR CARE.

1626
02:24:34,699 --> 02:24:38,202
THE COURT WOULD LIKE
TO HEAR THE MEDICAL FACTS.

IF YOU WERE TO
ASK ME AGAIN

THEN...

1629

INSTEAD OF WRITING
"NEUROTIC"

1630
02:24:56,220 --> 02:25:00,725
OR, UM, "PSYCHOTIC,"
THEN I MIGHT...

1631
02:25:02,226 --> 02:25:05,229
JUST, UM,
USE A WORD LIKE...

1632
02:25:08,232 --> 02:25:09,734

YES.

1635
02:25:20,244 --> 02:25:24,248
YOU WISH THE RECORDS
OF THIS COURT

1636
02:25:24,248 --> 02:25:28,252
TO STATE THAT
IN YOUR MEDICAL OPINION,

1637
02:25:28,252 --> 02:25:31,255
THE DECEASED WAS SUFFERING
FROM BEING "GOOD"?

1638
02:25:34,759 --> 02:25:38,262
PERHAPS THIS WAS
THE PSYCHOLOGICAL DEFECT

1639
02:25:38,763 --> 02:25:40,264
THAT LED
TO HER DEATH.

1640
02:25:42,266 --> 02:25:44,769
IS THAT WHAT WE SHALL
WRITE, DR. RICHARDSON?

1641
02:25:49,273 --> 02:25:50,775
NO.

1642
02:25:50,775 --> 02:25:52,777
Dr. Richardson:
OF COURSE NOT.

02:25:54,278 --> 02:25:56,781
Man: VERY WELL, THEN.

1644
02:25:56,781 --> 02:26:01,285
PERHAPS WE SHOULD STICK
TO YOUR ORIGINAL STATEMENT
THEN, DOCTOR.

1645
02:26:01,285 --> 02:26:02,787
YES.

1646
02:26:06,290 --> 02:26:09,160
I THINK THAT EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO SAY

1647
02:26:09,660 --> 02:26:12,163
ABOUT BESS McNEILL
HAS BEEN SAID ALREADY.

1648
02:26:12,163 --> 02:26:16,167
WE HAVE AGREED
TO SANCTION HER BURIAL,

1649
02:26:16,167 --> 02:26:20,171
BUT THERE CAN BE
NO FUNERAL SERVICE.

1650
02:26:20,555 --> 02:26:23,558
THE FACT THAT SOME OF US
KNEW THE DECEASED GIRL WELL

1651
02:26:23,558 --> 02:26:30,064
CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO INFLUENCE
THE FORM OF HER BURIAL.

1652
02:26:30,064 --> 02:26:33,067
BESS McNEILL'S FUNERAL
MUST BE THE SAME

1653
02:26:33,067 --> 02:26:36,571
AS ANYONE ELSE
OF HER KIND.

BY THE AUTHORITIES
SOMETIME THIS WEEK.

FROM THE ELDERS
TO BURY BESS...

1656
02:26:48,833 --> 02:26:55,339
BUT...I CANNOT DEVIATE
FROM THE PRINCIPLES THAT
APPLY TO FUNERALS HERE.

1657
02:26:58,209 --> 02:27:01,212
I MUST SAY ABOUT BESS
WHAT MUST BE SAID.

1658
02:27:37,081 --> 02:27:38,583
