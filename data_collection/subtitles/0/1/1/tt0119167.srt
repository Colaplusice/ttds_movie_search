1
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:26,641
Bjorling...

2
00:00:27,313 --> 00:00:28,975
Suliotis?

3
00:00:29,649 --> 00:00:31,810
Almost. Bjorling is easy.

4
00:00:38,993 --> 00:00:40,654
Tebaldi?

5
00:00:40,728 --> 00:00:42,992
Bingo!

6
00:00:43,064 --> 00:00:45,226
It's my turn now.

7
00:00:50,072 --> 00:00:52,633
- Don't look!
- But I'm not looking.

8
00:00:52,709 --> 00:00:54,199
Did Daddy look?

9
00:00:54,877 --> 00:00:56,367
Is that true?

10
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:10,955
Oh, God!

11
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:14,393
Gigli!

12
00:01:14,467 --> 00:01:17,402
That's obvious!
But what's the piece?

13
00:01:30,551 --> 00:01:31,882
Never heard it!

14
00:01:31,953 --> 00:01:33,614
Is it new?

15
00:01:34,455 --> 00:01:36,116
Seems to be.

16
00:01:37,292 --> 00:01:38,953
Well, darling?

17
00:01:47,137 --> 00:01:49,071
I'd say Handel.

18
00:01:49,139 --> 00:01:51,505
Right. But what is it?

19
00:01:54,178 --> 00:01:56,009
No idea!

20
00:02:02,554 --> 00:02:03,543
Well?

21
00:02:03,622 --> 00:02:05,954
I give up. What is it?

22
00:02:06,024 --> 00:02:07,822
Three-two to me!

23
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:13,060
So, what is it?

24
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,390
Now get your hands off!

25
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:17,403
Just listen!

26
00:03:44,335 --> 00:03:46,166
That's cheating!

27
00:03:46,237 --> 00:03:47,227
Sorry?

28
00:03:47,306 --> 00:03:49,297
It's cheating to be practicing.

29
00:03:49,375 --> 00:03:52,538
We've booked for 10:00
tomorrow morning. You are coming?

30
00:03:53,712 --> 00:03:54,941
Yes, sure.

31
00:04:00,353 --> 00:04:01,945
We'll put the boat in the water first.

32
00:04:02,623 --> 00:04:05,956
Can you give us a hand?
Let's say, in 20 minutes?

33
00:04:09,797 --> 00:04:12,232
Sure! Yes, I'll be there in 20 minutes.

34
00:04:12,301 --> 00:04:14,132
Okay. Thanks.

35
00:04:14,202 --> 00:04:15,692
See you in a tick.

36
00:04:24,981 --> 00:04:26,813
What's up with him?

37
00:04:26,884 --> 00:04:28,044
No idea.

38
00:04:28,118 --> 00:04:29,608
He seems in a huff.

39
00:04:29,687 --> 00:04:31,848
She didn't say a word.

40
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,084
Who did you arrange
to play with tomorrow?

41
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,490
Her.

42
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:36,925
Yesterday?

43
00:04:36,995 --> 00:04:38,656
The day before.

44
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:39,662
Well?

45
00:04:40,499 --> 00:04:42,160
Nothing. She was totally normal.

46
00:04:42,234 --> 00:04:44,566
Sissi isn't there.

47
00:04:44,637 --> 00:04:47,629
Maybe she was just in the house.
Or at the beach.

48
00:04:49,509 --> 00:04:51,477
Who were the two laddies?

49
00:04:52,145 --> 00:04:53,305
How should I know?

50
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,317
They're probably relatives.
I think his brother has a son that age.

51
00:05:33,826 --> 00:05:36,818
Don't put that there!
Take your things upstairs!

52
00:05:36,896 --> 00:05:37,885
Okay.

53
00:05:37,964 --> 00:05:39,295
Do it now!

54
00:05:39,365 --> 00:05:42,199
Don't leave things in the entrance,
or someone will trip over.

55
00:05:42,269 --> 00:05:45,761
There's still so much left in the car.

56
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:47,830
Are you listening?

57
00:05:47,908 --> 00:05:49,774
I'm going!

58
00:05:50,278 --> 00:05:53,270
Open the windows, will you.
We need to let some air in.

59
00:05:53,348 --> 00:05:55,282
Okay, Mom!

60
00:06:02,291 --> 00:06:04,886
Stop it, Rolfi! Stop it!

61
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:06,792
Go on, get down!

62
00:06:06,863 --> 00:06:08,728
I have to unpack!

63
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:11,831
Go on, get out!

64
00:06:13,838 --> 00:06:15,806
- Georg?
- Yes?

65
00:06:15,873 --> 00:06:17,738
Where's the other box
with the food?

66
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:20,242
I'll bring it right away.

67
00:06:20,312 --> 00:06:23,338
The golf gear was in the way.
I put it in the Rover last.

68
00:06:24,717 --> 00:06:29,451
We'd better get them in quick!
The things have got really hot!

69
00:06:29,522 --> 00:06:32,514
This cool-box is totally useless.

70
00:06:32,592 --> 00:06:35,756
Stop it now, you'll knock me over.

71
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:37,559
- The butter's all soft.
- Go see your mistress.

72
00:06:38,566 --> 00:06:40,898
There're some cold cuts in the other box.

73
00:06:40,968 --> 00:06:43,096
I'll get it. I'll just open the windows.

74
00:06:45,273 --> 00:06:48,606
Leave the shutters closed on the lake side,
or it'll be too hot.

75
00:06:48,677 --> 00:06:50,397
Stop that. You'll get something

76
00:06:50,398 --> 00:06:52,671
in a minute, I must just put this away.

77
00:06:52,749 --> 00:06:56,913
Can't you call the dog?
He won't let me put the things away.

78
00:06:57,019 --> 00:06:58,419
Rolfi!

79
00:06:58,455 --> 00:06:59,513
Come here!

80
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:00,750
Come and see your master!

81
00:07:00,824 --> 00:07:04,658
And the bottles too,
otherwise it'll all be warm by the evening.

82
00:07:08,333 --> 00:07:09,994
Stop it, Rolfi!

83
00:07:10,068 --> 00:07:11,558
Be quiet!

84
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:13,794
Come in!

85
00:07:14,707 --> 00:07:16,800
Sorry. He's off his head.

86
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,366
Come in!

87
00:07:19,378 --> 00:07:20,641
Hello.

88
00:07:20,714 --> 00:07:23,547
Thanks for coming.
It'd have been tough on our own.

89
00:07:23,617 --> 00:07:26,450
- No problem! This is...
- Paul. Nice to meet you.

90
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,250
Paul is son of a business colleague.

91
00:07:28,322 --> 00:07:31,655
- It's a pleasure. Nice of you to help.
- Mine too.

92
00:07:31,726 --> 00:07:33,387
I mean, the pleasure's mine.

93
00:07:34,562 --> 00:07:37,623
- Not so much his.
- Will you be quiet?

94
00:07:37,699 --> 00:07:38,859
Lunatic!

95
00:07:38,934 --> 00:07:41,402
- Get into the house, go on!
- Come here, Rolfi!

96
00:07:42,404 --> 00:07:44,703
- When did you get out here?
- Last week.

97
00:07:45,208 --> 00:07:46,038
You too?

98
00:07:46,109 --> 00:07:47,542
- Yes.
- No.

99
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:50,340
They didn't arrive till the weekend.
We came on Friday.

100
00:07:52,183 --> 00:07:53,514
Hello, Fred!

101
00:07:53,584 --> 00:07:55,677
Nice of you to come over right away.

102
00:07:57,688 --> 00:08:00,180
- How's Eva?
- Fine.

103
00:08:01,059 --> 00:08:02,720
- Hello.
- Hello, madam.

104
00:08:03,762 --> 00:08:05,252
...and where's Tropea?

105
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,390
In south Italy. Right at the tip,

106
00:08:07,466 --> 00:08:10,458
- almost on the toes of the boot.
- But it's even hotter there.

107
00:08:10,536 --> 00:08:12,197
Not necessarily.

108
00:08:12,271 --> 00:08:14,585
Last year when I was in Italy it was freezing

109
00:08:14,586 --> 00:08:16,436
and here you were swimming, right?

110
00:08:16,510 --> 00:08:20,310
But it's a shame Sissi isn't here.
Without her, it's...

111
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:22,711
- Be careful!
- I am!

112
00:08:22,784 --> 00:08:25,116
Careful, or the overhauling
will have been for nothing.

113
00:08:25,186 --> 00:08:27,177
Look, you can't see anything!

114
00:08:27,255 --> 00:08:28,244
Good.

115
00:08:29,258 --> 00:08:31,283
Can you help me lift the boom over?

116
00:08:35,164 --> 00:08:36,654
Mind the halyard!

117
00:08:51,015 --> 00:08:54,008
But she said she'd be there
for the whole holiday.

118
00:08:54,086 --> 00:08:58,250
Listen, my boy.
I don't know why she isn't there either.

119
00:08:58,357 --> 00:09:01,850
Maybe she went to Tropea
with a school friend. I don't know.

120
00:09:01,895 --> 00:09:05,228
Tomorrow we'll go over and ask
her mother. She's bound to explain all.

121
00:09:05,298 --> 00:09:06,959
Now stop moping...

122
00:09:07,033 --> 00:09:09,195
Why was Uncle Fred so strange?

123
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,431
I'm not surprised!

124
00:09:11,505 --> 00:09:14,099
She got pretty worked up
about it last time.

125
00:09:14,775 --> 00:09:16,471
Forget it, please.

126
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:20,408
She won't change,
and you'll just get in a state.

127
00:09:21,249 --> 00:09:22,511
Exactly!

128
00:09:23,185 --> 00:09:24,880
That's it!

129
00:09:26,389 --> 00:09:28,880
Great. They're outside
working on the boat.

130
00:09:31,328 --> 00:09:32,659
What?

131
00:09:33,797 --> 00:09:36,630
5:00 or 5:30.
I don't know the time here,

132
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,532
I mean, the kitchen clock has stopped.

133
00:09:38,603 --> 00:09:40,798
I must get a new battery on Monday.

134
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,071
What?

135
00:09:44,142 --> 00:09:45,906
Yes, that's what I'm doing now.

136
00:09:46,645 --> 00:09:48,374
Some fillets.

137
00:09:49,214 --> 00:09:51,279
Yes, you know, it's crazy. The whole thing

138
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:53,049
defrosted and now it needs eating.

139
00:09:53,954 --> 00:09:55,945
Come out and see us!

140
00:09:56,022 --> 00:10:00,015
No, really, like a fool, I froze
three pounds of beef fillet at once,

141
00:10:00,093 --> 00:10:02,255
and now here I am.

142
00:10:02,330 --> 00:10:05,891
No, I'm not joking.
Come and spend the weekend.

143
00:10:06,734 --> 00:10:07,666
What?

144
00:10:07,735 --> 00:10:10,204
He shouldn't make such a fuss.
Hold on.

145
00:10:10,872 --> 00:10:13,033
We need a sharp knife.

146
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,638
I'd like to see it again some day.
Tell Dad.

147
00:10:18,715 --> 00:10:20,046
Sorry.

148
00:10:20,116 --> 00:10:22,607
Tell your beloved to pack up his laptop,

149
00:10:22,685 --> 00:10:25,849
get in the car, and you'll be here
in two hours at the most!

150
00:10:27,791 --> 00:10:29,656
He shouldn't be so elusive.

151
00:10:31,262 --> 00:10:32,923
Okay. Think about it.

152
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:35,398
In any case,
there's enough steak here for a week.

153
00:10:37,435 --> 00:10:38,595
Bye, Fanny.

154
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,832
Say, give us another ring anyway

155
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:43,500
to tell us whether we can expect you.

156
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,066
Yes, bye.

157
00:10:45,144 --> 00:10:47,443
- What is it now?
- Someone's here.

158
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:49,448
- Where?
- At the door.

159
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:54,954
Hello?

160
00:10:55,023 --> 00:10:57,150
Hello. Sorry to disturb you.

161
00:10:57,258 --> 00:10:58,748
I'm from next door.

162
00:10:58,793 --> 00:11:01,729
We saw each other
when you stopped the car at the gate.

163
00:11:01,797 --> 00:11:03,458
Oh, yes, we did.

164
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:06,261
Come in, please.

165
00:11:07,436 --> 00:11:10,099
Hurry up, we're eating in 10 minutes!

166
00:11:10,173 --> 00:11:11,663
So what is it?

167
00:11:11,741 --> 00:11:13,231
Well...

168
00:11:13,309 --> 00:11:14,970
Eva sent...

169
00:11:15,045 --> 00:11:17,037
I mean, Mrs. Berlinger sent me.

170
00:11:17,114 --> 00:11:18,604
She's just cooking...

171
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:23,650
and she's run out of eggs.
She wonders if you can help her out.

172
00:11:23,721 --> 00:11:25,485
But of course.

173
00:11:25,557 --> 00:11:27,286
- How many does she need?
- Four.

174
00:11:28,026 --> 00:11:29,015
Four?

175
00:11:29,728 --> 00:11:32,026
- What for?
- Sorry?

176
00:11:32,097 --> 00:11:33,588
What for?

177
00:11:33,666 --> 00:11:35,657
What does she need the eggs for?

178
00:11:35,735 --> 00:11:37,396
I mean, what's she making?

179
00:11:37,470 --> 00:11:39,461
No idea.

180
00:11:40,207 --> 00:11:42,368
Are they okay like that
or shall I wrap them?

181
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,533
As you like.

182
00:11:45,212 --> 00:11:47,043
So how did you get in?

183
00:11:47,114 --> 00:11:49,606
At the front.
I mean, by the beach.

184
00:11:49,684 --> 00:11:51,845
But you didn't get wet at all!

185
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,410
There's a hole in the fence,

186
00:11:53,488 --> 00:11:54,978
by the water, not in the water.

187
00:11:55,057 --> 00:11:56,251
Fred knows -

188
00:11:56,325 --> 00:11:59,590
I mean, Mr. Berlinger knows it.
He showed me it.

189
00:11:59,695 --> 00:12:01,026
I see. Okay.

190
00:12:01,063 --> 00:12:02,725
So, wrapped, or is this okay?

191
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,733
No, no, that's fine, no problem.

192
00:12:04,801 --> 00:12:06,769
- Many thanks.
- You're welcome.

193
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:12,165
Love to Eva.
Look forward to the golf tomorrow!

194
00:12:12,243 --> 00:12:14,108
I'll tell her. Thanks again.

195
00:12:14,178 --> 00:12:16,669
And thanks again to Fred
and your friend -

196
00:12:16,747 --> 00:12:19,239
- Damn it!
- What's up?

197
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:26,881
It's not a disaster.

198
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:28,621
Hang on.

199
00:12:42,911 --> 00:12:44,970
Thank God, we just arrived...

200
00:12:45,647 --> 00:12:48,309
and I must shop
in the village on Monday.

201
00:12:48,383 --> 00:12:49,942
I'm really embarrassed.

202
00:12:50,019 --> 00:12:53,511
It's nothing. No one here eats eggs
for breakfast anyway,

203
00:12:53,589 --> 00:12:55,580
so it's not a major problem.

204
00:12:55,658 --> 00:12:57,593
That's a relief, thank you.

205
00:12:58,762 --> 00:13:01,253
I should just have been more careful.

206
00:13:02,232 --> 00:13:05,930
- I put my left hand -
- Well, no point in crying over spilt milk.

207
00:13:06,004 --> 00:13:07,335
You're really kind.

208
00:13:07,405 --> 00:13:09,168
One does one's best.

209
00:13:17,149 --> 00:13:18,639
I'm really sorry.

210
00:13:22,889 --> 00:13:24,584
I'm very clumsy, you know.

211
00:13:25,926 --> 00:13:28,361
I think I've got two left hands.

212
00:13:28,429 --> 00:13:30,761
So you're ideal for carrying eggs.

213
00:13:30,831 --> 00:13:32,765
Yes, you could say.

214
00:13:34,269 --> 00:13:36,032
Well...

215
00:13:36,104 --> 00:13:38,572
And what are we going to do now?

216
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:46,242
We do have steak,
but we might be getting visitors,

217
00:13:46,316 --> 00:13:48,750
and they're bound to want eggs
for breakfast.

218
00:13:49,587 --> 00:13:51,782
But you'll have four left.

219
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:57,284
After all, I did see
you had a box of twelve, right?

220
00:13:58,430 --> 00:14:00,762
You're right.

221
00:14:14,881 --> 00:14:16,542
Shouldn't I wrap them up?

222
00:14:16,617 --> 00:14:18,278
No need.

223
00:14:18,352 --> 00:14:19,512
Are you sure?

224
00:14:19,586 --> 00:14:21,418
If you want to.

225
00:14:21,489 --> 00:14:23,150
If I want to?

226
00:14:23,224 --> 00:14:25,283
Well, maybe it is better after all.

227
00:14:28,264 --> 00:14:30,596
- Oh, no!
- What's the matter?

228
00:14:32,768 --> 00:14:34,429
Oh, no!

229
00:15:06,707 --> 00:15:08,197
I'm sorry.

230
00:15:09,710 --> 00:15:12,179
Before you destroy the rest of the kitchen,

231
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:14,705
maybe you should take your eggs and leave.

232
00:15:16,551 --> 00:15:18,041
Well...

233
00:15:22,058 --> 00:15:23,889
Here you are.

234
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:25,551
Won't you wrap them?

235
00:15:42,413 --> 00:15:44,678
I'm really sorry.

236
00:15:45,517 --> 00:15:47,007
Honestly.

237
00:15:47,086 --> 00:15:48,576
Me too.

238
00:15:55,328 --> 00:15:56,556
There.

239
00:15:56,629 --> 00:15:59,292
- Here you are.
- Many thanks. Thank you.

240
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,334
I'll tell Mrs. Berlinger how nice you were.

241
00:16:01,369 --> 00:16:03,462
Okay. Do as you see fit.

242
00:16:03,537 --> 00:16:05,698
- Bye.
- Good-bye.

243
00:17:09,546 --> 00:17:11,207
Excuse me?

244
00:17:21,725 --> 00:17:23,057
Stop it! Rolfi!

245
00:17:23,128 --> 00:17:24,618
Excuse me!

246
00:17:26,398 --> 00:17:28,366
Off you go!

247
00:17:28,433 --> 00:17:30,094
Get lost!

248
00:17:30,168 --> 00:17:32,000
I mean now!

249
00:17:35,074 --> 00:17:37,941
I'm sorry. He's completely harmless.

250
00:17:38,010 --> 00:17:40,502
- He just wants to have a game.
- Funny game.

251
00:17:41,181 --> 00:17:42,842
Did he hurt you?

252
00:17:42,916 --> 00:17:44,577
Peter's just afraid of dogs.

253
00:17:44,651 --> 00:17:46,847
- I'm sorry.
- Me too.

254
00:17:46,921 --> 00:17:48,912
He jumped up on me.

255
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:50,651
I'm sorry about that.

256
00:17:50,725 --> 00:17:52,386
Well.

257
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,452
Shall I lock him in so you can leave?

258
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:56,555
- No need.
- I can tell my husband to -

259
00:17:56,632 --> 00:17:58,623
There's really no need, thanks.

260
00:17:58,734 --> 00:18:01,397
It's my fault.
I quite forgot the dog.

261
00:18:01,438 --> 00:18:03,599
Otherwise, I'd have come to fetch the...

262
00:18:04,341 --> 00:18:06,002
Oh! What a wonderful kit!

263
00:18:06,076 --> 00:18:07,737
Gallaway, isn't it?

264
00:18:10,982 --> 00:18:12,643
It's fantastic.

265
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:14,275
May I?

266
00:18:15,152 --> 00:18:17,519
We hardly stand a chance for tomorrow!

267
00:18:19,358 --> 00:18:21,155
Good clubs don't make good golfers.

268
00:18:21,827 --> 00:18:23,488
That's true, yes.

269
00:18:25,164 --> 00:18:28,065
Would it be cheeky of me
to ask if I can try it just once?

270
00:18:29,068 --> 00:18:31,229
Right now, outside?

271
00:18:31,304 --> 00:18:32,567
Please! Okay?

272
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,631
From the lawn out to the lake, okay?

273
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,341
- If it makes you happy. I -
- Thanks.

274
00:18:43,618 --> 00:18:45,108
Excuse me.

275
00:18:45,687 --> 00:18:47,519
He loves golf!

276
00:18:47,590 --> 00:18:49,558
- We both do.
- Sorry?

277
00:18:49,625 --> 00:18:51,456
Both of us. We both love golf.

278
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,876
Rolfi!

279
00:19:07,946 --> 00:19:09,538
Stop it!

280
00:19:09,614 --> 00:19:11,276
Rolfi!

281
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:13,011
Be quiet now!

282
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:15,851
What's up?

283
00:19:15,921 --> 00:19:18,755
I don't know,
probably it's too hot for him too.

284
00:19:37,446 --> 00:19:39,437
I'll go and see.

285
00:19:53,130 --> 00:19:54,961
Brilliant!

286
00:19:55,032 --> 00:19:57,365
Like the difference
between day and night.

287
00:19:58,770 --> 00:20:00,260
Thanks very much.

288
00:20:00,338 --> 00:20:01,828
You're welcome.

289
00:20:03,509 --> 00:20:05,443
Where's Tom?

290
00:20:05,511 --> 00:20:07,672
- Who?
- Did you give him the eggs?

291
00:20:07,747 --> 00:20:09,271
Sorry?

292
00:20:12,819 --> 00:20:14,753
The driver is absolutely top-class.

293
00:20:14,821 --> 00:20:16,152
You must try it.

294
00:20:16,223 --> 00:20:17,383
Listen, young man.

295
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:21,519
I don't know what game you're playing,
but I'm not going to join in.

296
00:20:23,831 --> 00:20:25,321
Will you go now, please?

297
00:20:29,471 --> 00:20:30,961
What game?

298
00:20:32,041 --> 00:20:33,674
Sorry, madam, but I don't understand

299
00:20:33,675 --> 00:20:35,307
why you're suddenly so unfriendly.

300
00:20:36,479 --> 00:20:40,142
Have Tom or I
done anything to annoy you?

301
00:20:40,216 --> 00:20:42,151
Please, would you leave?

302
00:20:43,754 --> 00:20:46,450
Did you behave badly while I was outside?

303
00:20:47,124 --> 00:20:49,059
Was he cheeky?

304
00:20:49,127 --> 00:20:51,994
- Did he say anything -
- That's enough.

305
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:56,199
I asked you to leave, so...

306
00:20:56,268 --> 00:20:57,930
please go.

307
00:20:59,005 --> 00:21:00,165
Okay.

308
00:21:01,107 --> 00:21:04,566
I don't understand what's upset you so,
but if you insist...

309
00:21:04,645 --> 00:21:06,306
Fine.

310
00:21:08,282 --> 00:21:11,115
Give the eggs to Tom
and we won't bother you again.

311
00:21:11,185 --> 00:21:12,847
I'm sorry?

312
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:15,412
Of course we'll be telling Eva and Fred.

313
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:18,857
Honestly, I've never experienced
anything like it before.

314
00:21:19,528 --> 00:21:21,359
What about you, Tom?

315
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,730
May we have the eggs now, please?

316
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,970
I told you to leave!

317
00:21:31,041 --> 00:21:32,975
Did I do something wrong...

318
00:21:33,043 --> 00:21:35,035
Now just get out of here, you...

319
00:21:35,113 --> 00:21:37,104
Is the dog with you?
What's going on?

320
00:21:37,181 --> 00:21:39,342
- Get them out!
- Good to see you, Mr. Schober.

321
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:40,907
You are Mr. Schober, right?

322
00:21:40,985 --> 00:21:42,977
Fred, I mean, Mr. Berlinger told me.

323
00:21:43,055 --> 00:21:45,353
What?
What's the matter?

324
00:21:45,424 --> 00:21:47,915
- Throw him out!
- Your wife's mistaken.

325
00:21:47,993 --> 00:21:49,654
I'm very glad you're here.

326
00:21:49,728 --> 00:21:51,890
I'm sure you can clarify
the misunderstanding.

327
00:21:51,965 --> 00:21:54,957
- Daddy, I can't -
- Please, Georg!

328
00:21:59,306 --> 00:22:01,900
It's outrageous!

329
00:22:02,910 --> 00:22:05,675
Can I explain how this
misunderstanding arose?

330
00:22:05,747 --> 00:22:08,910
Mrs. Berlinger sent me over
to fetch some eggs.

331
00:22:08,984 --> 00:22:10,474
So what? And then?

332
00:22:10,552 --> 00:22:13,886
Your wife gave the eggs to Peter,
but he smashed them.

333
00:22:13,956 --> 00:22:17,050
Yes. And she gave me
four more eggs, but...

334
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,287
then the dog jumped up on me...

335
00:22:19,362 --> 00:22:20,853
and now...

336
00:22:20,931 --> 00:22:23,764
But it was a 12-pack,
and you're shopping Monday anyway...

337
00:22:23,834 --> 00:22:25,825
We just want the eggs,

338
00:22:25,903 --> 00:22:27,393
that's all.

339
00:22:28,071 --> 00:22:30,233
Can you tell me what's going on?

340
00:22:39,652 --> 00:22:41,142
Give them the eggs.

341
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:43,382
Hold on!
Can you wait a moment?

342
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,481
- Can I take them?
- Just a moment.

343
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,220
What's going on?

344
00:22:47,294 --> 00:22:50,786
It can't just be about these ridiculous eggs.
Why this rage?

345
00:22:50,864 --> 00:22:53,356
I'm not justifying myself to these...

346
00:22:54,535 --> 00:22:58,164
I asked you to throw them out.
I must have my reasons.

347
00:23:00,509 --> 00:23:02,841
Do as you wish.
For me, the subject is closed.

348
00:23:02,911 --> 00:23:04,071
Anna?

349
00:23:08,451 --> 00:23:10,112
Would you please leave?

350
00:23:10,620 --> 00:23:12,781
My wife doesn't feel well.

351
00:23:15,459 --> 00:23:19,691
I can't act as arbitrator in a matter
I don't know anything about.

352
00:23:19,763 --> 00:23:21,424
Please, would you leave?

353
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:29,931
What is it?

354
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,499
If you don't mind?

355
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:35,647
So give them to him!

356
00:23:35,715 --> 00:23:37,377
What's going on?

357
00:23:37,451 --> 00:23:39,442
Nothing's going on.

358
00:23:39,519 --> 00:23:42,852
She gave him the eggs,
the dog jumped on him, he smashed them.

359
00:23:42,923 --> 00:23:45,256
He wants more.
Is it so complicated?

360
00:23:45,326 --> 00:23:47,157
What kind of tone is that supposed to be?

361
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:49,490
Watch I don't smash your balls as well!

362
00:23:53,502 --> 00:23:56,164
Now get out! Right now!

363
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,267
Is it broken?

364
00:24:05,448 --> 00:24:07,781
Be good, now.

365
00:24:07,852 --> 00:24:09,342
Behave yourself!

366
00:24:12,456 --> 00:24:14,117
Be nice!

367
00:24:14,191 --> 00:24:16,183
I don't want to hurt you,
but behave yourself!

368
00:24:21,466 --> 00:24:23,401
Please stay where you are.

369
00:24:23,469 --> 00:24:24,959
Please stay there!

370
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:29,335
- He hit me in the face.
- Yes. He started it.

371
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:33,669
You can help him if you want,
but no messing about.

372
00:24:35,683 --> 00:24:37,845
- Bring him a chair.
- My knee!

373
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,911
- He should take off his pants and sit down.
- A chair!

374
00:24:40,989 --> 00:24:43,480
Peter studies medicine. He'll fix it.

375
00:24:43,558 --> 00:24:45,720
Take off your pants, please.

376
00:24:56,039 --> 00:24:58,906
If you won't let me see your wound,
I can't help you.

377
00:24:59,009 --> 00:25:01,240
Sorry I hurt you,

378
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:04,214
but you left me no choice,
you must admit.

379
00:25:05,383 --> 00:25:08,615
Be reasonable, Mr. Schober.
Let him look at your leg.

380
00:25:08,687 --> 00:25:10,518
He's sure to be able to help.

381
00:25:12,992 --> 00:25:14,653
Will you leave please?

382
00:25:14,727 --> 00:25:15,922
Please!

383
00:25:17,263 --> 00:25:18,924
This won't get us anywhere.

384
00:25:18,999 --> 00:25:21,832
You must let him help you.
You haven't any choice.

385
00:25:22,802 --> 00:25:24,794
You're a ship's captain, sir.

386
00:25:25,573 --> 00:25:28,872
You know that on board ship,
the Captain's word is final.

387
00:25:29,543 --> 00:25:31,535
So, what do you want to do, sir?

388
00:25:32,381 --> 00:25:35,043
Do you want to call someone?
An ambulance?

389
00:25:35,117 --> 00:25:36,607
Or the police?

390
00:25:37,352 --> 00:25:40,686
Go on! I won't stop you.
Nor will Tom.

391
00:25:40,757 --> 00:25:42,486
That's a promise!

392
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:43,217
Right?

393
00:25:48,532 --> 00:25:50,193
What are you waiting for?

394
00:25:57,542 --> 00:26:00,102
He dropped the mobile in the water.

395
00:26:10,157 --> 00:26:11,818
Why are you doing this?

396
00:26:11,892 --> 00:26:13,382
Why not?

397
00:26:14,661 --> 00:26:16,754
Okay, then, another game.

398
00:26:17,432 --> 00:26:19,400
A guessing game.

399
00:26:20,768 --> 00:26:22,429
What's this?

400
00:26:37,187 --> 00:26:38,518
A golf ball.

401
00:26:38,588 --> 00:26:41,114
Exactly, sir, a golf ball.

402
00:26:42,193 --> 00:26:44,354
And why do I have it here in my pocket?

403
00:26:47,432 --> 00:26:49,366
The lady knows.

404
00:26:49,434 --> 00:26:51,095
Because...

405
00:26:54,206 --> 00:26:55,868
Well?

406
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:00,008
Well?

407
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,442
- Because you didn't hit it.
- Exactly!

408
00:27:03,517 --> 00:27:05,678
And why didn't I hit it?

409
00:27:05,752 --> 00:27:07,151
Because you were stopped.

410
00:27:07,221 --> 00:27:08,210
Exactly.

411
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:10,788
And because I had to test
the club another way.

412
00:27:23,005 --> 00:27:25,030
Where is he?

413
00:27:25,107 --> 00:27:26,439
Cold.

414
00:27:28,345 --> 00:27:29,835
Cold.

415
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:32,172
Colder.

416
00:27:34,685 --> 00:27:35,845
Cold.

417
00:27:53,273 --> 00:27:55,999
Warmer.

418
00:27:58,312 --> 00:28:00,473
Hotter.

419
00:28:00,548 --> 00:28:01,879
Cold.

420
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,430
Really cold.

421
00:28:33,685 --> 00:28:35,847
Warmer, hotter, boiling!

422
00:29:00,048 --> 00:29:02,676
Would you kindly get me
some food from the kitchen?

423
00:29:03,852 --> 00:29:05,343
Would it be possible?

424
00:29:13,163 --> 00:29:15,654
Bananas or something like that.

425
00:29:18,002 --> 00:29:21,495
And don't think of picking up
a knife or something.

426
00:29:21,573 --> 00:29:23,404
I'd be sorry if you did.

427
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:24,965
For your sake.

428
00:29:35,989 --> 00:29:38,480
The sun's coming out again.

429
00:29:43,164 --> 00:29:45,689
Very kind of you. Thank you.

430
00:30:01,384 --> 00:30:03,045
Hello! Sweetie!

431
00:30:07,024 --> 00:30:08,958
Where are you?

432
00:30:11,228 --> 00:30:13,390
Come on down!

433
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:17,566
We're both thinking the same, aren't we?

434
00:30:22,909 --> 00:30:24,968
We saw your boat!

435
00:30:25,611 --> 00:30:28,512
Hello, Gerda!
Hello, Robert!

436
00:30:28,581 --> 00:30:31,244
How long have you been here?

437
00:30:31,318 --> 00:30:32,808
Not long.

438
00:30:32,886 --> 00:30:35,821
We're still unpacking.

439
00:30:35,889 --> 00:30:37,983
How long are you staying?

440
00:30:38,059 --> 00:30:39,890
A week or two.

441
00:30:39,961 --> 00:30:41,622
We're not sure yet.

442
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:43,027
Great!

443
00:30:43,098 --> 00:30:45,863
- Hello, darling, lovely to see you.
- Hello.

444
00:30:51,942 --> 00:30:53,603
Have you met my sister?

445
00:30:53,677 --> 00:30:56,111
No! Pleased to meet you!

446
00:30:56,179 --> 00:30:57,339
Hello, Robert!

447
00:30:57,447 --> 00:30:59,143
- Everything okay?
- Of course.

448
00:31:01,619 --> 00:31:05,020
This is Paul.
He's living with our neighbors.

449
00:31:05,089 --> 00:31:07,422
- Hello, Paul!
- Hello, pleased to meet you!

450
00:31:07,493 --> 00:31:09,427
Are you cold?

451
00:31:09,495 --> 00:31:12,157
No, I have eczema.

452
00:31:12,231 --> 00:31:15,395
You should go swimming.
The water here does wonders for you.

453
00:31:15,468 --> 00:31:16,799
Thank you for the tip.

454
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,235
Hello.

455
00:31:18,304 --> 00:31:19,271
How's Georg?

456
00:31:19,939 --> 00:31:21,497
Very well, thank you!

457
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:23,065
So where is he?

458
00:31:23,144 --> 00:31:25,476
He pulled a muscle putting the mast up.

459
00:31:25,546 --> 00:31:27,036
So he's lying down.

460
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,604
That's a real shame.

461
00:31:28,682 --> 00:31:30,844
That's the result of doing
everything yourself.

462
00:31:30,919 --> 00:31:33,320
Robert wouldn't dream of putting our boat

463
00:31:33,321 --> 00:31:35,253
in the water on his own, right?

464
00:31:37,092 --> 00:31:39,459
Tell your beloved to pull
himself together.

465
00:31:39,529 --> 00:31:42,521
We barbecue nearly every night.
We can't do without him.

466
00:31:42,598 --> 00:31:44,259
I'll tell him!

467
00:31:44,333 --> 00:31:47,667
I mean it. As soon as he's better,
come and see us right away.

468
00:31:47,738 --> 00:31:51,139
Robert's son is here with his girlfriend.
He'll like her.

469
00:31:51,975 --> 00:31:53,307
Right then.

470
00:31:54,612 --> 00:31:56,102
Have a good time, darling.

471
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,513
If the wind doesn't change, bring the car.

472
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:00,551
The weather forecast says wind.

473
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:02,679
For tomorrow.

474
00:32:02,755 --> 00:32:05,417
- I said to Robert we'd get nowhere.
- Where are you moored?

475
00:32:05,491 --> 00:32:06,981
What?

476
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:09,790
Oh! Over there,
behind the headland.

477
00:32:09,863 --> 00:32:11,023
But on the other side.

478
00:32:12,365 --> 00:32:15,198
- The wooden house covered in ivy?
- That's it.

479
00:32:15,268 --> 00:32:18,363
- It looks very pretty.
- Indeed it is, young man.

480
00:32:18,439 --> 00:32:20,270
Right then. Bye!

481
00:32:26,748 --> 00:32:29,308
- Are you staying all week?
- This week, sure.

482
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:34,980
Might see you tonight!

483
00:32:35,058 --> 00:32:37,993
As you like.
We're always pleased to see you!

484
00:32:38,729 --> 00:32:40,390
I don't know yet.

485
00:32:40,464 --> 00:32:43,797
- We'll see how Georg is.
- Yes, you see! See you soon!

486
00:32:47,305 --> 00:32:49,967
They'll be here
in two hours at the latest...

487
00:32:50,041 --> 00:32:51,872
and then this farce will be over.

488
00:32:51,943 --> 00:32:53,775
Sorry, but that's not quite true.

489
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,144
I heard the end of your phone call.

490
00:32:56,215 --> 00:33:00,151
You asked your friends to call you back
if they were coming tonight.

491
00:33:00,253 --> 00:33:01,744
Or did I misunderstand you?

492
00:33:01,788 --> 00:33:04,313
Even if they can't reach us,
they'll still come.

493
00:33:04,391 --> 00:33:06,018
Is lying allowed?

494
00:33:06,927 --> 00:33:08,417
Just a moment!

495
00:33:14,135 --> 00:33:15,625
There you are. Please.

496
00:33:16,972 --> 00:33:19,304
You really can speak to us openly.

497
00:33:19,375 --> 00:33:23,209
You'll feel much better.
We're also being very open with you.

498
00:33:27,884 --> 00:33:30,717
Perhaps try putting a cushion under it.

499
00:33:31,889 --> 00:33:34,915
If you'd accepted Peter's help,
it would be hurting less.

500
00:33:37,094 --> 00:33:39,255
I'm quite willing to help you.

501
00:33:39,331 --> 00:33:41,492
But I don't want to impose.

502
00:33:45,571 --> 00:33:47,199
Careful!

503
00:33:48,708 --> 00:33:51,734
Yes, raise the leg.
That's bound to be more comfortable.

504
00:33:55,416 --> 00:33:57,748
There we are! Done!

505
00:33:59,086 --> 00:34:00,917
Can you leave it out, you bastards?

506
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:04,114
Is that an offer?

507
00:34:04,192 --> 00:34:05,682
- What?
- Using our first names?

508
00:34:11,534 --> 00:34:13,365
I'm very happy about that.

509
00:34:13,436 --> 00:34:16,371
It does vastly simplify our communication.

510
00:34:18,041 --> 00:34:20,703
I'd still like to apologize for just now,

511
00:34:20,777 --> 00:34:22,711
for being too familiar,

512
00:34:23,380 --> 00:34:25,568
but you must admit that the smack was

513
00:34:25,569 --> 00:34:27,875
an unreasonable reaction nonetheless.

514
00:34:30,755 --> 00:34:32,086
Paul.

515
00:34:35,894 --> 00:34:37,885
This is Peter.

516
00:34:39,431 --> 00:34:42,094
Come here, Tom.
Have you no manners?

517
00:34:42,168 --> 00:34:43,829
Give Georg your hand.

518
00:34:45,905 --> 00:34:47,566
Here, it's for the pain.

519
00:34:47,641 --> 00:34:50,167
What? To you, we're non-existent?

520
00:34:50,244 --> 00:34:52,576
- Being on familiar terms doesn't mean -
- You bastard...

521
00:35:09,532 --> 00:35:11,763
Quiet! Please!

522
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:12,995
Stop!

523
00:35:15,172 --> 00:35:18,335
Stop it now, otherwise your mother
will get it, do you understand?

524
00:35:20,679 --> 00:35:21,668
Understand?

525
00:35:27,386 --> 00:35:29,047
Keep quiet now.

526
00:35:38,565 --> 00:35:41,227
What a scene,
just for being on first-name terms!

527
00:35:54,917 --> 00:35:57,284
We were only trying to improve relations.

528
00:35:58,188 --> 00:36:00,452
- I thought we could -
- Why are you doing that?

529
00:36:03,460 --> 00:36:05,122
Fatty, why are you doing that?

530
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,357
Go on, tell us!

531
00:36:12,871 --> 00:36:15,931
I don't know. I...

532
00:36:16,007 --> 00:36:17,497
The Captain wants to know.

533
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:18,406
Why?

534
00:36:19,746 --> 00:36:21,043
Well?

535
00:36:25,218 --> 00:36:27,779
It's difficult to talk about it. I...

536
00:36:27,855 --> 00:36:29,345
Don't be shy.

537
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:33,059
You know just how hard it is...

538
00:36:33,994 --> 00:36:36,429
My God, what a fuss!

539
00:36:37,098 --> 00:36:38,861
His father got a divorce...

540
00:36:38,933 --> 00:36:40,423
when he was still that tiny,

541
00:36:41,402 --> 00:36:43,735
- and he took another woman -
- That's not true!

542
00:36:43,806 --> 00:36:45,296
He's lying!

543
00:36:48,377 --> 00:36:50,437
It was my mother who divorced...

544
00:36:50,514 --> 00:36:51,640
because...

545
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:55,307
because...

546
00:36:58,823 --> 00:37:00,154
I...

547
00:37:05,230 --> 00:37:09,064
Because she wanted to have
her little teddy all to herself,

548
00:37:09,134 --> 00:37:11,466
and since then,
he's been a queer and a crook.

549
00:37:11,537 --> 00:37:13,096
You see?

550
00:37:15,108 --> 00:37:17,201
You're an asshole!

551
00:37:17,277 --> 00:37:21,715
The truth is, he comes from
a filthy, deprived family,

552
00:37:22,383 --> 00:37:24,283
he has five brothers and sisters

553
00:37:24,351 --> 00:37:26,012
who are all drug addicts.

554
00:37:27,188 --> 00:37:28,679
His dad's an alcoholic,

555
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:31,692
and as for his mother,
you can imagine.

556
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:34,251
Or rather, the truth is,
it's him who fucks her.

557
00:37:36,599 --> 00:37:38,089
Tough,

558
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:39,657
but true.

559
00:37:40,336 --> 00:37:42,304
Come on, calm down now.

560
00:37:44,441 --> 00:37:46,467
You're disgusting. Can't you cut out

561
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:48,775
your obscenities in front of the child?

562
00:37:48,846 --> 00:37:50,177
Oh! Sorry.

563
00:37:50,247 --> 00:37:52,113
Of course.
What answer would you like?

564
00:37:53,017 --> 00:37:54,848
What would satisfy you?

565
00:37:57,188 --> 00:38:00,454
Anyway, what I said isn't true.
You know that as well as I.

566
00:38:02,294 --> 00:38:03,955
Look at him.

567
00:38:04,697 --> 00:38:07,667
Do you really think he comes from
a deprived background?

568
00:38:08,401 --> 00:38:09,834
Right.

569
00:38:10,837 --> 00:38:13,169
He's a spoiled little shit-face,

570
00:38:14,442 --> 00:38:17,434
tormented by ennui and world-weariness,

571
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:19,479
weighed down by the void of existence!

572
00:38:22,251 --> 00:38:24,014
That's hard, honestly!

573
00:38:28,624 --> 00:38:30,957
You see, he's smiling again.

574
00:38:35,198 --> 00:38:36,130
Right.

575
00:38:36,199 --> 00:38:38,031
Satisfied?

576
00:38:38,702 --> 00:38:41,193
Or another version?

577
00:38:49,281 --> 00:38:50,771
I'm hungry.

578
00:38:50,849 --> 00:38:53,011
I'll see what there is.

579
00:38:59,960 --> 00:39:02,554
You see, the truth is,
he's a drug addict.

580
00:39:03,897 --> 00:39:06,229
That's why he's going now, and...

581
00:39:09,904 --> 00:39:12,600
That's why he has bad nerves, you see.

582
00:39:12,674 --> 00:39:14,505
Me too, I'm a drug addict.

583
00:39:15,511 --> 00:39:19,607
Together we rob rich families
in smart houses

584
00:39:19,682 --> 00:39:22,014
so we can afford the stuff.

585
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,120
Can you stop this lunacy?

586
00:39:25,188 --> 00:39:27,554
I get the message,

587
00:39:27,624 --> 00:39:29,922
isn't that enough for you?

588
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:31,757
You get the message?

589
00:39:31,829 --> 00:39:33,990
Great!

590
00:39:34,932 --> 00:39:37,366
Fatty! He's got it!

591
00:39:39,071 --> 00:39:41,164
Now he knows everything!

592
00:39:42,674 --> 00:39:44,505
That's fantastic, really.

593
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:46,776
Listen.

594
00:39:46,846 --> 00:39:48,336
Peter, come in here!

595
00:39:49,349 --> 00:39:51,715
Listen, we're going to bet, okay?

596
00:39:52,719 --> 00:39:54,381
Sit down, come on!

597
00:39:54,888 --> 00:39:57,550
- It's dark in here.
- Now don't fall asleep!

598
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,522
We'll bet that -

599
00:40:01,596 --> 00:40:04,087
What's the time?

600
00:40:04,165 --> 00:40:06,030
Twenty to 9:00.

601
00:40:06,101 --> 00:40:08,935
That in, let's say, 12 hours...

602
00:40:09,005 --> 00:40:10,802
all three of you'll be kaput.

603
00:40:15,011 --> 00:40:16,240
What?

604
00:40:17,914 --> 00:40:19,939
You bet us, that tomorrow at 9:00,
you'll be alive,

605
00:40:20,017 --> 00:40:21,848
and we bet you,
you'll be dead, okay?

606
00:40:36,468 --> 00:40:37,662
They don't want to bet.

607
00:40:39,606 --> 00:40:41,540
That's no good. You have to bet.

608
00:40:42,308 --> 00:40:45,402
What do you think?
Do you think they've a chance of winning?

609
00:40:45,478 --> 00:40:47,743
You are on their side, aren't you?

610
00:40:47,815 --> 00:40:49,476
So, who will you bet with?

611
00:40:49,550 --> 00:40:51,211
What kind of bet is this?

612
00:40:51,285 --> 00:40:54,255
Dead, they can give nothing,
and conversely, they can win nothing.

613
00:40:54,322 --> 00:40:56,790
They'll lose in any case. Obviously.

614
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,348
Stop this nonsense.

615
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,655
Are you trying to scare us?

616
00:41:01,798 --> 00:41:03,823
Isn't what you've done already enough?

617
00:41:06,002 --> 00:41:07,492
What do you want? Our money?

618
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:09,231
Help yourselves and get out.

619
00:41:11,575 --> 00:41:15,238
Don't you think Fred and Eva
might come and see what's going on?

620
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:17,907
And give us a good hiding, right?

621
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:24,147
Okay.

622
00:41:24,222 --> 00:41:25,713
As they say on TV:

623
00:41:25,791 --> 00:41:27,452
The bets are placed!

624
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:31,460
And what'll we do now?

625
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:34,329
Could you kindly make us some food?

626
00:41:35,001 --> 00:41:36,662
You worry me, Fatty.

627
00:41:37,337 --> 00:41:39,567
Can't you control yourself?

628
00:41:40,241 --> 00:41:42,573
You've just gobbled up the sausage.

629
00:41:43,744 --> 00:41:45,234
It's disgusting.

630
00:41:45,313 --> 00:41:46,803
What are these people going to think?

631
00:41:46,881 --> 00:41:48,713
I haven't eaten since lunchtime!

632
00:41:48,784 --> 00:41:50,684
And stop calling me Fatty.

633
00:41:50,752 --> 00:41:52,879
- Okay, Tom.
- Okay, Jerry.

634
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,323
But can't you pay some attention
to your appearance?

635
00:41:57,994 --> 00:42:00,326
You think it makes you more attractive?

636
00:42:02,666 --> 00:42:04,327
Look at the Captain's wife.

637
00:42:05,236 --> 00:42:07,329
Do you think she finds you attractive?

638
00:42:08,305 --> 00:42:10,297
- With your flab?
- Stop it!

639
00:42:11,810 --> 00:42:13,607
Look at her.

640
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:15,168
She's not as old as all that.

641
00:42:16,348 --> 00:42:17,838
Excuse me, madam.

642
00:42:19,285 --> 00:42:21,685
You'd be quite acceptable to her,

643
00:42:21,754 --> 00:42:23,915
but with that figure of yours!

644
00:42:24,690 --> 00:42:26,352
Follow her example.

645
00:42:26,426 --> 00:42:28,758
Her body's really in shape.

646
00:42:28,829 --> 00:42:30,524
Not a single extra calorie!

647
00:42:31,331 --> 00:42:33,163
I'm not so sure!

648
00:42:33,835 --> 00:42:35,234
What?

649
00:42:36,671 --> 00:42:39,037
Did you hear that, madam?

650
00:42:40,542 --> 00:42:42,204
That's really cheeky!

651
00:42:42,878 --> 00:42:45,244
We can't put up with that, can we?

652
00:42:53,857 --> 00:42:55,688
Hey you! Indian!

653
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:58,188
What's your name anyway?

654
00:43:02,533 --> 00:43:03,967
Georg.

655
00:43:05,237 --> 00:43:06,727
Like Daddy.

656
00:43:06,805 --> 00:43:08,102
Lovely!

657
00:43:09,441 --> 00:43:11,774
Georgie-boy, come over to me.

658
00:43:13,346 --> 00:43:14,836
Come here.

659
00:43:20,154 --> 00:43:22,714
Come on. Sit down beside me.
We're going to play a game.

660
00:43:22,790 --> 00:43:23,779
Let the boy go!

661
00:43:25,159 --> 00:43:27,993
I know you don't want to play,
but you'll see, it's fun.

662
00:43:28,063 --> 00:43:29,724
Let the boy go!

663
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:34,693
See how your mother's
standing up for you?

664
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:37,705
- Dad could take an example from her!
- Stop it!

665
00:43:37,773 --> 00:43:40,435
For that we're going
to let your mom play with us.

666
00:43:41,677 --> 00:43:43,339
Hold Georgie a moment.

667
00:43:45,349 --> 00:43:48,341
We're playing a nice little game:
Kitten in the Bag.

668
00:43:50,355 --> 00:43:51,845
You'll see, it's fun.

669
00:43:54,859 --> 00:43:57,192
There! Don't panic! Nothing will happen.

670
00:43:57,296 --> 00:43:59,457
I said this is a nice game.

671
00:43:59,498 --> 00:44:00,988
A family game.

672
00:44:01,834 --> 00:44:04,963
Daddy is playing too
so he doesn't get bored.

673
00:44:05,038 --> 00:44:07,029
Right. Now listen!

674
00:44:07,707 --> 00:44:09,868
You'll have to keep still, or it's no fun.

675
00:44:11,211 --> 00:44:12,873
Hey! Listen now!

676
00:44:14,815 --> 00:44:16,305
That's right, Georgie.

677
00:44:17,151 --> 00:44:19,119
We'll work together, okay?

678
00:44:20,622 --> 00:44:22,598
The pillow case isn't uncomfortable, is it?

679
00:44:22,599 --> 00:44:24,114
You've enough air, haven't you?

680
00:44:26,628 --> 00:44:28,563
You've enough air, haven't you?

681
00:44:28,631 --> 00:44:29,461
Yes.

682
00:44:29,532 --> 00:44:31,227
Great. Then we can finally start.

683
00:44:31,901 --> 00:44:33,732
So, the starting point of our game

684
00:44:33,803 --> 00:44:37,968
was that mommy and our little Indian
wanted to slip out of here.

685
00:44:38,042 --> 00:44:40,010
- But why?
- Don't know.

686
00:44:40,077 --> 00:44:41,738
Is lying allowed, Fatty?

687
00:44:43,081 --> 00:44:45,743
What an example you're setting!
You know why.

688
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:47,478
You mentioned her flab.

689
00:44:47,552 --> 00:44:48,951
What do you mean, me?

690
00:44:49,020 --> 00:44:51,182
It was you who doubted her flawlessness!

691
00:44:52,124 --> 00:44:54,058
Okay. Forget it!

692
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:57,391
I understand too how it embarrassed her.
With the boy here.

693
00:44:57,496 --> 00:44:59,328
That's why we play
"Kitten in the Bag. "

694
00:44:59,366 --> 00:45:01,300
To preserve moral decency.

695
00:45:01,368 --> 00:45:05,361
The kiddy wears a pillow case
While mummy strips off, in great haste!

696
00:45:09,644 --> 00:45:12,135
We mustn't hurt the kitty cat, right?
Dad's broken leg is enough.

697
00:45:12,213 --> 00:45:14,045
Let the child go. Please!

698
00:45:14,116 --> 00:45:16,175
Exactly. Daddy's playing with us too.

699
00:45:21,825 --> 00:45:23,486
What are we waiting for?

700
00:45:26,496 --> 00:45:30,593
Tell your wife not to be so shy.
It's ridiculous.

701
00:45:30,668 --> 00:45:32,533
Anyway, I'm sure she isn't flabby.

702
00:45:34,205 --> 00:45:36,697
Please, let the child go.

703
00:45:37,542 --> 00:45:38,873
Please!

704
00:45:40,212 --> 00:45:42,737
You only have to say to her,
"Get undressed. "

705
00:45:44,684 --> 00:45:46,481
I beg you!

706
00:45:48,488 --> 00:45:50,319
"Get undressed, my darling. "

707
00:46:12,648 --> 00:46:14,138
Get undressed.

708
00:46:16,486 --> 00:46:18,647
"Get undressed, my darling. "

709
00:46:23,327 --> 00:46:25,488
Get undressed, my darling.

710
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:48,421
Well done.

711
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:51,186
What did I say? Not an ounce of flab.

712
00:47:51,260 --> 00:47:52,921
Now, let's get dressed again.

713
00:48:31,171 --> 00:48:33,834
Fatty, can you take the little piggy?

714
00:48:33,908 --> 00:48:36,069
He isn't quite potty-trained.

715
00:48:36,144 --> 00:48:37,975
Go and clean him up.

716
00:48:38,046 --> 00:48:40,709
- Let the child go!
- I won't do anything to him.

717
00:49:28,003 --> 00:49:29,664
Will you sit down, please?

718
00:49:33,009 --> 00:49:35,341
I'd advise you not to kick me.

719
00:49:47,858 --> 00:49:50,350
I hope you won't be
too bored with these two.

720
00:49:51,763 --> 00:49:53,890
Pour a pan of water over his head.

721
00:49:55,968 --> 00:49:58,459
But make sure you don't ruin the carpet.

722
00:50:27,070 --> 00:50:29,561
No, no, of course that was a joke.

723
00:50:29,639 --> 00:50:31,971
I have to retake Latin in the autumn.

724
00:50:32,041 --> 00:50:36,376
If I pass it, then things will get moving.
I'll study commercial law.

725
00:50:36,447 --> 00:50:38,608
But before that there's military service.

726
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:41,111
Does it hurt a lot?

727
00:50:41,185 --> 00:50:42,847
Why don't you kill us right away?

728
00:50:43,521 --> 00:50:45,238
Don't forget the entertainment value.

729
00:50:45,239 --> 00:50:47,048
We'd all be deprived of our pleasure.

730
00:51:46,759 --> 00:51:48,989
Sorry about your leg.

731
00:51:49,061 --> 00:51:51,326
But it's your fault, if I might say so.

732
00:51:51,999 --> 00:51:53,830
Why did you smack Paul?

733
00:51:58,039 --> 00:52:01,031
For me, begging for the eggs
to no avail was very unpleasant.

734
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,337
Humiliating, actually.

735
00:52:04,412 --> 00:52:06,074
I don't know if you realize that.

736
00:52:07,216 --> 00:52:09,548
It's just not worth it,

737
00:52:09,618 --> 00:52:12,109
all this charade, for a box of eggs.

738
00:52:15,892 --> 00:52:19,384
They should still be there.

739
00:52:19,462 --> 00:52:22,296
You should have trusted
what your wife said.

740
00:52:22,366 --> 00:52:26,029
She really begged you just
to let us leave with the eggs.

741
00:52:26,103 --> 00:52:28,265
Naturally one's always wiser
after the event.

742
00:52:30,175 --> 00:52:32,234
Ah! There they are!

743
00:52:34,746 --> 00:52:36,738
One of them is cracked.

744
00:52:36,816 --> 00:52:40,479
It's not bad, what these boxes withstand.
When you think-

745
00:52:41,254 --> 00:52:43,587
Why are you doing that?

746
00:52:43,657 --> 00:52:45,648
How stupid do you think I am?

747
00:52:45,726 --> 00:52:49,389
I don't understand. You're really
forcing me to treat you badly.

748
00:52:54,402 --> 00:52:57,064
Jesus! That's it! You've done it now!

749
00:53:00,109 --> 00:53:02,976
And Paul even said
we should take care of the carpet!

750
00:53:06,148 --> 00:53:08,140
Please, let us go!

751
00:53:11,955 --> 00:53:14,322
You're so young still!

752
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,328
You have all your life before you!

753
00:53:21,065 --> 00:53:23,728
Nothing's happened yet!

754
00:53:25,237 --> 00:53:26,431
We'll say...

755
00:53:26,505 --> 00:53:29,532
that Georg broke his leg in the boat.

756
00:53:30,477 --> 00:53:32,809
- Everyone'll believe it, and -
- Please stop.

757
00:53:32,879 --> 00:53:34,540
Why are you humiliating yourself?

758
00:53:34,614 --> 00:53:36,673
It's just as unpleasant for me as for you.

759
00:54:14,478 --> 00:54:15,810
Georgie?

760
00:54:17,315 --> 00:54:18,805
Where are you?

761
00:55:44,330 --> 00:55:45,820
Georgie!

762
00:55:45,898 --> 00:55:47,389
I'm coming!

763
00:56:41,529 --> 00:56:43,690
Hold on,
I'll put on some music for us.

764
00:57:27,147 --> 00:57:29,081
Don't come any closer!

765
00:57:31,318 --> 00:57:33,047
The trigger!

766
00:57:35,056 --> 00:57:36,990
You have to prime the trigger!

767
00:57:53,843 --> 00:57:56,004
And you need to pull it too!

768
00:58:55,680 --> 00:58:57,842
Tralee trala, here we are!

769
00:58:59,184 --> 00:59:00,549
Mommy!

770
00:59:03,622 --> 00:59:05,215
Hello, my darling!

771
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:08,417
Is everything okay?

772
00:59:12,533 --> 00:59:13,795
They've -

773
00:59:14,301 --> 00:59:16,735
They've killed Sissi!

774
00:59:17,404 --> 00:59:18,928
- Hi, Beavis!
- Hi, Butt-Head!

775
00:59:19,607 --> 00:59:21,872
- Everything under control?
- Looks like it.

776
00:59:24,779 --> 00:59:25,803
May I?

777
00:59:25,880 --> 00:59:27,541
Please. Sure.

778
00:59:28,718 --> 00:59:31,881
You must wonder, Captain,
where this lovely rifle comes from.

779
00:59:33,389 --> 00:59:34,947
Or does it seem familiar?

780
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:37,654
Haven't you ever been hunting with Fred?

781
00:59:39,830 --> 00:59:42,994
Do you know, your little darling
just tried to kill me with it?

782
00:59:46,004 --> 00:59:50,168
Scarcely believable, but it's the truth,
and nothing but the truth.

783
00:59:50,241 --> 00:59:51,732
Isn't that right, Georgie?

784
00:59:56,849 --> 00:59:58,511
What do you say, Tom?

785
00:59:58,585 --> 00:59:59,916
Dreadful.

786
01:00:01,855 --> 01:00:03,516
What's the time?

787
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:06,253
Just after 11:00.

788
01:00:06,327 --> 01:00:09,296
We should start thinking about our bet,
don't you think?

789
01:00:11,465 --> 01:00:15,129
Actually we ought to be grateful
to Georgie for helping us.

790
01:00:15,804 --> 01:00:17,135
One for Beavis,

791
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:18,968
one for Butt-Head.

792
01:00:22,745 --> 01:00:25,646
A, B, BOO and out go you!

793
01:00:25,715 --> 01:00:30,176
You're not leaving at this stage.
First you'll have to say your age.

794
01:00:32,923 --> 01:00:34,254
Well?

795
01:00:37,829 --> 01:00:39,456
She doesn't want to play.

796
01:00:39,964 --> 01:00:42,057
Well, how old do you think she is?

797
01:00:44,070 --> 01:00:45,560
37?

798
01:00:47,573 --> 01:00:49,302
No flab...

799
01:00:49,809 --> 01:00:51,505
So I'd say,

800
01:00:51,578 --> 01:00:54,069
let's be generous,
let's say 35.

801
01:00:56,383 --> 01:00:57,315
Agreed?

802
01:01:00,154 --> 01:01:01,485
She agrees.

803
01:01:01,556 --> 01:01:03,547
Who are you going to start counting with?

804
01:01:04,258 --> 01:01:05,190
Her?

805
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:12,156
And now I'm going to
get myself something to eat.

806
01:01:13,836 --> 01:01:15,498
One, two, three,

807
01:01:15,572 --> 01:01:17,665
four, five, six, seven...

808
01:01:34,192 --> 01:01:36,126
Can I get anyone anything?

809
01:02:12,803 --> 01:02:14,737
You're an idiot, Fatty.

810
01:02:14,805 --> 01:02:16,248
You don't shoot the person you've

811
01:02:16,249 --> 01:02:18,173
counted out, but the one that's left over!

812
01:02:18,242 --> 01:02:19,573
What's wrong with you?

813
01:02:19,644 --> 01:02:21,805
- He tried to escape!
- So what?

814
01:02:21,879 --> 01:02:24,041
That's no reason
to get trigger-happy.

815
01:02:24,116 --> 01:02:25,606
Have you no sense of timing?

816
01:02:26,452 --> 01:02:27,942
What's the time?

817
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:29,783
Just before 12:00.

818
01:02:29,855 --> 01:02:31,346
Shit.

819
01:02:31,424 --> 01:02:33,085
We'll get nothing from the others now.

820
01:02:34,260 --> 01:02:37,093
- Let's get out of here.
- Fine.

821
01:02:37,163 --> 01:02:41,123
Thanks so much for the driver.
I'll put it back in the bag, okay?

822
01:02:41,202 --> 01:02:42,191
Thanks.

823
01:02:43,337 --> 01:02:44,827
So, have a good evening!

824
01:02:44,905 --> 01:02:46,237
Good-bye!

825
01:02:46,308 --> 01:02:47,605
Bye!

826
01:05:11,705 --> 01:05:13,639
They've gone.

827
01:05:51,016 --> 01:05:53,678
Do you hear? They've gone!

828
01:06:37,235 --> 01:06:39,726
I'll get a knife.

829
01:08:28,727 --> 01:08:30,753
Come on.
Calm down now.

830
01:08:36,236 --> 01:08:38,569
Take deep breaths.

831
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:43,632
Come on, darling.

832
01:08:44,913 --> 01:08:46,574
Calm down now.

833
01:08:49,251 --> 01:08:51,082
Calm yourself.

834
01:08:53,589 --> 01:08:54,920
Calm yourself.

835
01:08:54,991 --> 01:08:57,824
That's it. Take some deep breaths.

836
01:10:52,823 --> 01:10:55,156
We've got to get out of here.

837
01:10:56,995 --> 01:10:59,054
What if they come back?

838
01:11:01,734 --> 01:11:04,168
Do you think you can walk
if I support you?

839
01:11:09,108 --> 01:11:10,599
I'll try.

840
01:11:20,455 --> 01:11:22,787
What's wrong with your arm?

841
01:11:28,564 --> 01:11:32,626
Shall I try and make a splint for it?
Then I can hold you better.

842
01:11:34,304 --> 01:11:36,465
No, it's okay. Come on.

843
01:12:01,434 --> 01:12:02,925
Let's go.

844
01:12:10,010 --> 01:12:11,501
Let's go.

845
01:12:21,290 --> 01:12:22,780
Okay?

846
01:12:32,803 --> 01:12:34,465
No! Anna!

847
01:12:36,508 --> 01:12:37,873
No!

848
01:13:25,129 --> 01:13:26,791
They've locked the door.

849
01:13:27,766 --> 01:13:29,597
We must use the window.

850
01:13:29,668 --> 01:13:31,158
I can't.

851
01:13:31,236 --> 01:13:32,726
Georg!

852
01:13:32,804 --> 01:13:35,137
- Please!
- I can't manage it.

853
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:36,368
You go.

854
01:13:36,442 --> 01:13:39,934
It's crazy wasting so much time.
Run for it. Please!

855
01:13:40,012 --> 01:13:41,844
Climb out of the kitchen window.

856
01:13:41,915 --> 01:13:44,076
Try to get as far as the inn, or...

857
01:13:44,151 --> 01:13:46,642
If we're locked in here,
the gate will be shut too.

858
01:13:48,322 --> 01:13:50,257
That's true.

859
01:13:51,092 --> 01:13:53,754
Take a pair of pliers and cut the fence.

860
01:13:53,828 --> 01:13:57,765
But careful on the road.
Maybe they're waiting out there.

861
01:13:59,268 --> 01:14:01,293
Where are the pliers?

862
01:14:03,973 --> 01:14:06,067
I don't know.

863
01:14:06,142 --> 01:14:08,133
Here, in the kitchen.

864
01:14:10,146 --> 01:14:11,636
No,

865
01:14:11,715 --> 01:14:13,240
down at the boat shed.

866
01:14:14,452 --> 01:14:16,443
I can't leave you alone here.

867
01:14:16,520 --> 01:14:18,010
Go now, please!

868
01:14:19,357 --> 01:14:21,519
Put some clothes on.

869
01:14:21,593 --> 01:14:24,084
And shoes too, so you can run.

870
01:14:29,769 --> 01:14:31,930
Hold on, the bag's still here.

871
01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:33,495
Down there.

872
01:14:46,121 --> 01:14:48,055
I'll hide down in the wine cellar.

873
01:14:48,723 --> 01:14:50,555
The key must be in the door.

874
01:14:52,495 --> 01:14:55,328
I'll shut myself in
and wait for you to come back.

875
01:15:00,337 --> 01:15:02,669
How will you get down there?

876
01:15:02,739 --> 01:15:04,229
I'll manage.

877
01:15:20,459 --> 01:15:22,394
Go now! Please!

878
01:15:43,151 --> 01:15:45,086
The mobile! It's working again!

879
01:15:45,154 --> 01:15:46,086
What?

880
01:15:46,155 --> 01:15:48,646
It's working!
It's obviously dried out.

881
01:15:48,725 --> 01:15:50,886
- So get on the phone!
- Who to?

882
01:15:50,960 --> 01:15:53,452
Anyone! The police!

883
01:15:53,530 --> 01:15:55,191
What's their number?

884
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:56,926
No idea.

885
01:15:57,034 --> 01:15:58,399
Call my mother...

886
01:15:58,435 --> 01:16:00,404
Your father-
No, wait...

887
01:16:00,472 --> 01:16:03,134
Call Peter, he's at home,
I know, he wanted to -

888
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:05,870
Press four and then hit speed-dial.

889
01:16:08,714 --> 01:16:10,204
It's not ringing.

890
01:16:12,718 --> 01:16:14,208
Let me listen.

891
01:16:17,391 --> 01:16:18,722
But there is a signal!

892
01:16:18,792 --> 01:16:20,953
Some of the contacts
are probably still damp.

893
01:16:39,983 --> 01:16:40,972
Nothing.

894
01:16:43,153 --> 01:16:45,816
Get the hair dryer.
Maybe it'll help.

895
01:16:46,657 --> 01:16:48,818
Can you pass me the chair?

896
01:17:15,623 --> 01:17:17,454
It won't work.

897
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:02,766
Leave it, come on.

898
01:19:04,112 --> 01:19:06,012
Maybe it's permanently broken.

899
01:19:06,081 --> 01:19:07,571
Get going!

900
01:19:10,253 --> 01:19:13,745
We're wasting far too much time.
Let me do it.

901
01:19:16,092 --> 01:19:17,924
Go on!

902
01:19:20,431 --> 01:19:22,592
Pull me over there on the chair.

903
01:19:22,666 --> 01:19:25,158
I think it'll be easier than walking.

904
01:19:57,840 --> 01:19:59,034
Thanks.

905
01:20:00,509 --> 01:20:02,443
And now, run!

906
01:20:15,026 --> 01:20:16,994
Please, forgive me!

907
01:20:24,202 --> 01:20:25,794
It -

908
01:20:36,884 --> 01:20:38,875
I love you!

909
01:20:48,063 --> 01:20:49,554
Run, please!

910
01:22:45,729 --> 01:22:47,890
Help!

911
01:23:20,201 --> 01:23:22,693
Peter? It's Georg!

912
01:23:24,206 --> 01:23:27,141
Can you hear me?
I can barely hear you!

913
01:23:28,978 --> 01:23:31,641
Listen, if you can hear me,

914
01:23:31,715 --> 01:23:34,582
send the police over to our
lake house, right away!

915
01:23:36,319 --> 01:23:37,582
Hello?

916
01:23:38,089 --> 01:23:39,954
Shit!

917
01:23:51,737 --> 01:23:53,672
Peter! Can you hear me?

918
01:26:01,183 --> 01:26:02,344
Stop!

919
01:28:15,702 --> 01:28:17,192
Missed!

920
01:28:17,270 --> 01:28:18,760
Morning, Captain.

921
01:28:20,408 --> 01:28:21,898
Morning.

922
01:28:21,976 --> 01:28:24,809
They'll be there any minute.

923
01:28:24,879 --> 01:28:27,872
We'll have to hurry then.
Right, Beavis?

924
01:28:27,950 --> 01:28:29,781
Why don't you believe me?

925
01:28:29,851 --> 01:28:33,048
- How old did we say? 37?
- 35.

926
01:28:33,121 --> 01:28:37,183
Good that the battery
charger's in the car!

927
01:28:37,260 --> 01:28:39,694
- If it's her age, you must start with her.
- Why?

928
01:28:39,762 --> 01:28:41,593
- The battery was okay.
- That's the rules.

929
01:28:41,664 --> 01:28:43,496
Okay, I'll start with her.

930
01:28:43,567 --> 01:28:45,899
Yes, I know.

931
01:28:45,970 --> 01:28:49,907
It's time you had another idea.
The lady tried that trick before.

932
01:28:49,975 --> 01:28:51,465
Count faster, Beavis.

933
01:28:53,144 --> 01:28:55,237
Do you think we have no imagination?

934
01:28:55,313 --> 01:28:58,147
Without risk, you can't have a bet,
that's obvious, Captain.

935
01:28:58,251 --> 01:29:00,185
You must have a chance too.

936
01:29:00,219 --> 01:29:02,136
The wind blows where it wishes.

937
01:29:02,137 --> 01:29:04,919
That's the joy of sailing, don't you think?

938
01:29:04,992 --> 01:29:06,323
Right then!

939
01:29:06,393 --> 01:29:07,883
...thirty-four, thirty-five!

940
01:29:07,961 --> 01:29:10,122
Don't make the same mistake again.

941
01:29:10,197 --> 01:29:12,180
It's the one that's left who's turn it is,

942
01:29:12,181 --> 01:29:13,690
not the one who's counted out.

943
01:29:19,307 --> 01:29:20,240
Hang on.

944
01:29:20,309 --> 01:29:22,971
I can see a new toy.

945
01:29:23,712 --> 01:29:25,771
I assume we owe this to the lady?

946
01:29:27,951 --> 01:29:30,613
This will make things a bit more amusing.

947
01:29:32,289 --> 01:29:34,553
The dumb suffer in unspectacular fashion.

948
01:29:36,227 --> 01:29:38,058
We want to offer the audience something...

949
01:29:38,129 --> 01:29:40,188
and show what we can do, right?

950
01:29:49,408 --> 01:29:51,240
You can join in again now.

951
01:29:54,914 --> 01:29:57,405
We were already
on first-name terms, right?

952
01:29:58,919 --> 01:30:00,580
So, Anna,

953
01:30:01,488 --> 01:30:03,012
now we're going to play:

954
01:30:03,090 --> 01:30:05,524
"The Loving Wife", or...

955
01:30:05,592 --> 01:30:07,474
Whether by knife or whether by gun

956
01:30:07,475 --> 01:30:09,689
Losing your life can sometimes be fun.

957
01:30:13,034 --> 01:30:14,696
Hey! No falling asleep!

958
01:30:15,371 --> 01:30:18,568
You have to play with us,
or you'll be gagged again.

959
01:30:18,641 --> 01:30:20,472
That's not very nice, is it?

960
01:30:23,413 --> 01:30:26,576
So, here are the rules of the game:

961
01:30:26,650 --> 01:30:29,848
Georgie senior has been counted out,
so it's his turn.

962
01:30:31,189 --> 01:30:32,850
It'll be hard to change that.

963
01:30:33,691 --> 01:30:35,852
Unless you want to take his place.

964
01:30:37,029 --> 01:30:38,519
Do you want to?

965
01:30:41,066 --> 01:30:44,332
I'm sure Fatty will understand.
Right, Fatty?

966
01:30:44,404 --> 01:30:46,065
Don't call me Fatty.

967
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:50,473
- You see, he understands.
- Get this over with. That's enough.

968
01:30:50,543 --> 01:30:52,205
That's enough?

969
01:30:52,279 --> 01:30:53,940
You think that's enough?

970
01:30:55,816 --> 01:30:57,477
What do you think, Anna?

971
01:30:57,585 --> 01:30:59,918
Have you had enough?
Or do you want to play some more?

972
01:31:00,722 --> 01:31:02,314
Don't reply anymore.

973
01:31:02,391 --> 01:31:04,723
Let them do what they want. Please!

974
01:31:04,793 --> 01:31:06,955
Then it'll be over quicker.

975
01:31:07,029 --> 01:31:09,190
Huh, that's cowardly!

976
01:31:09,265 --> 01:31:12,098
We're not up to feature film length yet.

977
01:31:12,168 --> 01:31:14,102
Is that enough?

978
01:31:14,170 --> 01:31:15,595
But you want a real ending,

979
01:31:15,596 --> 01:31:17,971
with plausible plot development, don't you?

980
01:31:18,041 --> 01:31:21,670
The bet is still on.
It can't be withdrawn unilaterally.

981
01:31:22,347 --> 01:31:23,439
So:

982
01:31:23,515 --> 01:31:25,915
the game is called: "The Loving Wife. "

983
01:31:25,984 --> 01:31:29,317
Although Beavis has done the counting,
she can choose...

984
01:31:29,387 --> 01:31:31,879
who will be next. And...

985
01:31:31,957 --> 01:31:33,618
using what implement!

986
01:31:34,293 --> 01:31:36,454
Do we prefer the little knife?

987
01:31:36,529 --> 01:31:38,361
Or the rifle?

988
01:31:39,599 --> 01:31:41,760
Well then, what does the housewife say?

989
01:31:46,274 --> 01:31:48,265
Hello, wakey, wakey!

990
01:31:50,978 --> 01:31:53,914
So, you're not interested?

991
01:31:53,982 --> 01:31:56,075
You don't want to play anymore.

992
01:31:57,186 --> 01:31:59,347
Beavis, show her the game again.

993
01:31:59,421 --> 01:32:00,616
Wait.

994
01:32:00,690 --> 01:32:02,021
Here you are.

995
01:32:02,091 --> 01:32:03,581
Hey, careful!

996
01:32:03,660 --> 01:32:05,321
I almost cut myself.

997
01:32:05,395 --> 01:32:06,885
Really?

998
01:32:17,943 --> 01:32:21,106
You see. It's the little knife.
You can spare him that.

999
01:32:21,179 --> 01:32:23,011
You only have to play with us.

1000
01:32:26,118 --> 01:32:27,779
I understand, Anna.

1001
01:32:27,854 --> 01:32:29,344
I understand, really!

1002
01:32:30,356 --> 01:32:33,520
It's not a good feeling,
causing the one you love to suffer.

1003
01:32:35,195 --> 01:32:38,256
But it costs so little to avoid all that.

1004
01:32:38,333 --> 01:32:41,825
You only need follow the rules,
and all will be well.

1005
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:09,892
What must I do?

1006
01:33:12,938 --> 01:33:15,099
You see, it wasn't that difficult.

1007
01:33:15,774 --> 01:33:17,538
And we'll make it easy too.

1008
01:33:17,610 --> 01:33:19,771
You recite a prayer of your choice.

1009
01:33:19,846 --> 01:33:22,343
If you say it flawlessly, God will help you

1010
01:33:22,344 --> 01:33:24,375
and you choose what happens next.

1011
01:33:30,224 --> 01:33:32,557
Or shall we carry on with Georgie senior?

1012
01:33:34,296 --> 01:33:35,320
I don't know a prayer.

1013
01:33:36,998 --> 01:33:38,659
You don't know any prayers?

1014
01:33:39,569 --> 01:33:41,469
Not a single prayer?

1015
01:33:43,906 --> 01:33:44,895
Is that possible?

1016
01:33:46,075 --> 01:33:47,566
Tell her one, Fatty.

1017
01:33:47,644 --> 01:33:49,669
Stop calling me Fatty all the time.

1018
01:33:49,746 --> 01:33:51,737
I'll stop saying it. Well?

1019
01:33:53,684 --> 01:33:56,153
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1020
01:33:56,220 --> 01:33:59,246
- That's too easy.
- I can't think of any others.

1021
01:34:00,425 --> 01:34:01,585
Okay.

1022
01:34:01,659 --> 01:34:04,322
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1023
01:34:06,332 --> 01:34:08,266
No! Not like that!

1024
01:34:08,334 --> 01:34:09,825
It's a prayer.

1025
01:34:09,903 --> 01:34:12,497
You can't just drone on like that.

1026
01:34:12,572 --> 01:34:15,735
You're asking the Lord God for something.
So pray properly.

1027
01:34:17,612 --> 01:34:20,080
Go on.
Go down on your knees properly.

1028
01:34:21,415 --> 01:34:23,508
Go on! Get on with it!

1029
01:34:28,857 --> 01:34:31,621
There. That's right. Kneel down properly.

1030
01:34:34,130 --> 01:34:36,064
Put your hands together.

1031
01:34:36,733 --> 01:34:38,564
Not on your stomach.

1032
01:34:38,635 --> 01:34:41,298
Where is the one you pray to?
Up there!

1033
01:34:42,206 --> 01:34:44,970
You have to pray to the heavens!
That's it!

1034
01:34:46,577 --> 01:34:50,241
Right, and now, in a fervent tone,
if you don't mind.

1035
01:34:56,455 --> 01:34:59,288
- Beavis, can you help her a little?
- No!

1036
01:35:07,934 --> 01:35:10,095
Oh Lord and Father, make me kind,

1037
01:35:12,607 --> 01:35:14,438
So I, in heaven, my place may find.

1038
01:35:14,509 --> 01:35:15,976
Well done!
You did that well!

1039
01:35:17,311 --> 01:35:20,804
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1040
01:35:20,883 --> 01:35:24,216
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1041
01:35:24,286 --> 01:35:26,949
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1042
01:35:27,023 --> 01:35:31,323
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1043
01:35:31,394 --> 01:35:35,661
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how.

1044
01:35:35,733 --> 01:35:39,999
whether quick and painless by the bullet...

1045
01:35:40,071 --> 01:35:41,539
Careful!

1046
01:35:48,013 --> 01:35:49,982
Where's the remote?

1047
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:53,516
Where's the fucking remote control?

1048
01:36:19,783 --> 01:36:22,946
That was the trial run,
and now we're going for Olympic Gold:

1049
01:36:23,019 --> 01:36:26,853
If you can recite this prayer,
which is sadly much too short,

1050
01:36:26,923 --> 01:36:30,587
from back to front, without any mistakes,

1051
01:36:30,661 --> 01:36:33,653
you can not only choose
which of you kicks the bucket first,

1052
01:36:33,731 --> 01:36:38,066
but also, and no doubt
this will interest you more - how:

1053
01:36:38,137 --> 01:36:40,970
whether quick and painless by the bul -

1054
01:36:44,711 --> 01:36:48,545
You shouldn't have done that, Anna.
One doesn't break the rules.

1055
01:36:48,615 --> 01:36:51,449
Sorry. You've failed.

1056
01:36:54,822 --> 01:36:57,313
Say good-bye to Georgie.

1057
01:37:32,298 --> 01:37:34,289
Would you sit down?

1058
01:38:14,746 --> 01:38:16,236
Can you give me your gloves?

1059
01:38:21,386 --> 01:38:23,878
...only it's all inverted.

1060
01:38:23,956 --> 01:38:27,414
But of course all these predictions are wrong
so as to avoid a panic.

1061
01:38:27,493 --> 01:38:28,983
But now Kelvin knows how it really is...

1062
01:38:29,062 --> 01:38:32,225
and wants to warn his wife
and daughter in time.

1063
01:38:32,299 --> 01:38:34,114
But the problem is not only getting

1064
01:38:34,115 --> 01:38:36,292
from the world of antimatter to reality,

1065
01:38:36,370 --> 01:38:37,895
- but also to regain communication -
- Look!

1066
01:38:39,240 --> 01:38:40,935
Now that's a sporting attitude!

1067
01:38:45,147 --> 01:38:46,978
Hey, look out, fatso!

1068
01:38:47,049 --> 01:38:48,539
I thought you were a non-swimmer.

1069
01:38:56,893 --> 01:38:59,054
Go and get the widow.
She'll feel lonely otherwise.

1070
01:39:02,867 --> 01:39:04,528
Would you mind cooperating?

1071
01:39:04,602 --> 01:39:07,572
It's not easy.
Otherwise I might hurt you.

1072
01:39:13,078 --> 01:39:15,013
So. Where was I?

1073
01:39:15,081 --> 01:39:18,573
The communication problems
between matter and antimatter.

1074
01:39:18,651 --> 01:39:21,313
Exactly. As if you were in a black hole!

1075
01:39:21,387 --> 01:39:25,222
Gravitation is so strong that nothing
can escape it: absolute silence.

1076
01:39:25,292 --> 01:39:26,953
- By the way, what's the time?
- What?

1077
01:39:27,027 --> 01:39:28,517
What's the time?

1078
01:39:28,595 --> 01:39:30,086
Just after eight.

1079
01:39:30,165 --> 01:39:31,154
Already?

1080
01:39:38,140 --> 01:39:39,300
Why?

1081
01:39:39,375 --> 01:39:42,538
The deadline was at 9:00.
She had almost an hour left!

1082
01:39:42,611 --> 01:39:45,079
Firstly,
it was too hard to sail like that,

1083
01:39:45,147 --> 01:39:49,642
- and secondly, I'm starting to get hungry.
- That's true.

1084
01:40:03,002 --> 01:40:04,993
...when Kelvin overcomes gravitation,

1085
01:40:05,070 --> 01:40:07,402
it turns out that one universe is real,

1086
01:40:07,473 --> 01:40:09,635
but the other is just a fiction.

1087
01:40:09,709 --> 01:40:11,074
How does that happen?

1088
01:40:11,144 --> 01:40:14,477
What do I know! It was a kind of
model projection in cyberspace.

1089
01:40:14,547 --> 01:40:17,881
And where is your hero now?
In reality or fiction?

1090
01:40:17,952 --> 01:40:20,443
His family is in reality
and he's in fiction.

1091
01:40:20,521 --> 01:40:23,685
- But the fiction is real, isn't it?
- How do you mean?

1092
01:40:23,759 --> 01:40:26,751
- Well, you see it in the film, right?
- Of course.

1093
01:40:26,828 --> 01:40:30,127
So, it's just as real as the reality
which you see likewise, right?

1094
01:40:30,198 --> 01:40:31,325
- Crap.
- Why?

1095
01:40:59,899 --> 01:41:02,232
Is anyone awake yet?

1096
01:41:09,343 --> 01:41:10,833
Who is it?

1097
01:41:18,187 --> 01:41:19,347
Good morning to you.

1098
01:41:19,421 --> 01:41:21,912
Sorry to disturb you so early,
but I've come from Anna's.

1099
01:41:21,990 --> 01:41:23,480
And?

1100
01:41:24,828 --> 01:41:26,489
Don't you remember me?

1101
01:41:26,563 --> 01:41:29,225
Yesterday afternoon, on the jetty.
I'm Paul.

1102
01:41:29,299 --> 01:41:30,789
Oh, yes.

1103
01:41:32,001 --> 01:41:33,833
- Good morning.
- Morning.

1104
01:41:33,904 --> 01:41:37,237
Anna sent me. We had guests arrive
unexpectedly this morning...

1105
01:41:37,308 --> 01:41:40,301
and she wonders if
you could spare her a few eggs?

1106
01:41:40,378 --> 01:41:41,868
I think so.

1107
01:41:41,947 --> 01:41:43,437
Come in.

1108
01:41:43,515 --> 01:41:45,676
Wait a minute.
