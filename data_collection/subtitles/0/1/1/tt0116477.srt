1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,000
O, my old friend! Thy face is
valanc'd since I saw thee last,

2
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:05,400
comest thou to beard me in Denmark?

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,420
What, my young lady
and mistress! By'r lady,

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:11,540
your ladyship is nearer to
heaven than when I saw you last,

5
00:00:11,740 --> 00:00:14,620
by the altitude of a
chopine. Pray God, your voice,

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,100
like a piece of uncurrent gold,
be not cracked within the ring.

7
00:00:18,340 --> 00:00:22,860
Masters, you are all welcome. We'll
e'en to't like French falconers,

8
00:00:22,860 --> 00:00:26,340
fly at anything we see: we'll
have a speech straight. Come,

9
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,860
give us a taste of your quality.
Come, a passionate speech.

10
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,420
- What speech, my good lord?
- I heard thee speak me a speech once,

11
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,820
but it was never acted. Or if it
was, not above once, for the play,

12
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:40,100
I remember, pleased not the million,

13
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,340
'twas caviar to the general, but
it was, as I received it, and others,

14
00:00:44,540 --> 00:00:47,380
whose judgments in such matters
cried in the top of mine,

15
00:00:47,380 --> 00:00:48,820
an excellent play,

16
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:52,420
well digested in the scenes, set
down with as much modesty as cunning.

17
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:55,380
I remember, one said there
were no sallets in the lines

18
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:58,420
to make the matter savoury,
or no matter in the phrase

19
00:00:58,740 --> 00:01:01,820
which might indite the
author of affectation,

20
00:01:01,820 --> 00:01:05,100
but called it an honest
method, as wholesome as sweet,

21
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,020
and by very much more
handsome than fine.

22
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,740
One speech in it I chiefly
loved: 'twas AEneas' tale to Dido,

23
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,860
and thereabout of it especially
where he speaks of Priam's slaughter:

24
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:20,700
if it live in your memory, begin at
this line, let me see, let me see:

25
00:01:22,700 --> 00:01:28,100
The rugged Pyrrhus, like th'
Hyrcanian beast, it is not so...

26
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:31,260
- It begins with Pyrrhus.
- It begins with Pyrrhus.

27
00:01:31,620 --> 00:01:34,860
'The rugged Pyrrhus,
he whose sable arms,

28
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:38,100
black as his purpose,
did the night resemble

29
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:40,740
when he lay couched
in the ominous horse,

30
00:01:40,820 --> 00:01:44,420
hath now this dread and
black complexion smear'd

31
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:46,940
with heraldry more dismal,

32
00:01:47,060 --> 00:01:52,540
head to foot now is be total gules,

33
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,020
horridly trick'd with blood of
fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,

34
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,700
bak'd and impasted with the
parching streets, that lend

35
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:02,700
a tyrannous and a damned
light to their vile murders:

36
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:04,660
roasted in wrath and fire,

37
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:07,380
and thus o'ersized with coagulate gore,

38
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:10,020
with eyes like carbuncles,
the hellish Pyrrhus

39
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,740
old grandsire Priam seeks.'

40
00:02:17,740 --> 00:02:19,460
So, proceed you.

41
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:26,940
'Fore God, my lord, well spoken,
with good accent and good discretion.

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:32,260
Anon he finds him,

43
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:35,140
striking too short at Greeks:

44
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:40,180
his antique sword, rebellious
to his arm, lies where it falls,

45
00:02:40,220 --> 00:02:42,340
repugnant to command:

46
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,380
unequal match'd,
Pyrrhus at Priam drives,

47
00:02:45,380 --> 00:02:49,580
in rage strikes wide, but with the
whiff and wind of his fell sword

48
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:53,220
the unnerved father falls.
Then senseless Ilium,

49
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:56,180
seeming to feel this
blow, with flaming top

50
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,820
stoops to his base,

51
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:02,300
and with a hideous crash
takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear.

52
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:06,860
For lo! his sword, which was declining
on the milky head of reverend Priam,

53
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,420
seem'd i' the air to stick: so,
as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,

54
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:15,620
and, like a neutral to his
will and matter, did nothing.

55
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:19,220
But as we often see, against some storm,

56
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:26,020
a silence in the heavens, the rack
stand still, the bold winds speechless,

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,820
and the orb below as hush as death,

58
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,860
anon the dreadful thunder
doth rend the region,

59
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:38,980
so, after Pyrrhus' pause, a roused
vengeance sets him new a-work,

60
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:43,540
and never did the Cyclops'
hammers fall on Mars's armour

61
00:03:43,540 --> 00:03:47,020
forg'd for proof
eterne, with less remorse

62
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:51,380
than Pyrrhus' bleeding
sword now falls on Priam.

63
00:03:51,380 --> 00:03:54,860
Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune!

64
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,860
All you gods, in general
synod, take away her power,

65
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:02,140
break all the spokes and
fellies from her wheel,

66
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:05,460
and bowl the round nave
down the hill of heaven,

67
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:08,740
- as low as to the fiends!'
- This is too long.

68
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,180
It shall to the
barber's, with your beard.

69
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,740
Pr'ythee say on. He's for a jig

70
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,420
or a tale of bawdry, or he sleeps.

71
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,140
Say on,

72
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:25,620
- come to Hecuba.
- 'But who, o who,

73
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,380
- had seen the mobled queen...'
- 'The mobled queen'?

74
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:32,420
That's good! 'Mobled queen' is good.

75
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:38,820
'Run barefoot up and down, threatening
the flames with bisson rheum,

76
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:42,940
a clout upon that head
where late the diadem stood,

77
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,220
and for a robe, about her
lank and all o'erteemed loins,

78
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:51,660
a blanket, in the
alarm of fear caught up,

79
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:56,540
who this had seen, with
tongue in venom steep'd,

80
00:04:56,540 --> 00:05:00,180
'gainst Fortune's state
would treason have pronounc'd:

81
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:03,340
but if the gods themselves
did see her then,

82
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:07,980
when she saw Pyrrhus make malicious
sport in mincing with his sword

83
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,620
her husband's limbs, the instant
burst of clamour that she made,

84
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:15,780
unless things mortal
move them not at all,

85
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,900
would have made milch the
burning eyes of heaven,

86
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:22,980
and passion in the gods.'

87
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:27,980
Look, whether he has not turn'd
his colour, and has tears in's eyes.

88
00:05:28,220 --> 00:05:29,980
Pray you, no more!

89
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:40,060
'Tis well. I'll have thee
speak out the rest of this soon.

90
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:43,420
Good my lord, will you see the players well
bestowed? Do you hear? Let them be well used,

91
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:47,180
for they are the abstracts
and brief chronicles of the time,

92
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:49,420
after your death you were
better have a bad epitaph

93
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:51,540
than their ill report while you live.

94
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:53,940
My lord, I will use them
according to their desert.

95
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:56,700
God's bodykins, man, better!

96
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:59,540
Use every man after his desert,

97
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,900
and who should scape whipping?

98
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:06,260
Use them after your
own honour and dignity:

99
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:11,740
the less they deserve, the
more merit is in your bounty.

100
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,820
- Take them in.
- Come, sirs.

101
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:20,140
Follow him, friends. We'll
hear a play to-morrow.

102
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:27,780
Dost thou hear me, old friend? Can
you play 'The Murder of Gonzago'?

103
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:29,940
- Ay, my lord.
- We'll ha't to-morrow night.

104
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,900
You could, for a need, study a
speech of some dozen or sixteen lines

105
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,900
which I would set down and
insert in't? Could you not?

106
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,060
- Ay, my lord.
- Very well. Follow that lord

107
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:38,860
and look you:

108
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:41,420
mock him not.

109
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:49,060
My good friends, I'll leave you till
night: you are welcome to Elsinore.

110
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,500
- Good my lord!
- Ay, so. Good-bye to you.

111
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:00,380
Now I am alone.

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:10,420
O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!

113
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:17,980
Is it not monstrous
that this player here,

114
00:07:17,980 --> 00:07:21,100
but in a fiction,
in a dream of passion,

115
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:24,220
could force his soul
so to his own conceit

116
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:27,420
that from her working
all his visage wan'd,

117
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:32,100
tears in his eyes, distraction
in's aspect, a broken voice,

118
00:07:32,700 --> 00:07:38,100
and his whole function suiting with
forms to his conceit? And all for nothing!

119
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:43,380
For Hecuba? What's Hecuba
to him, or he to Hecuba,

120
00:07:43,380 --> 00:07:45,220
that he should weep for her?

121
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:49,900
What would he do, had he the motive
and the cue for passion that I have?

122
00:07:49,900 --> 00:07:53,740
He would drown the stage with tears

123
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:56,900
and cleave the general
ear with horrid speech,

124
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:59,780
make mad the guilty,
and appal the free,

125
00:07:59,780 --> 00:08:04,980
confound the ignorant, and amaze, indeed,
the very faculties of eyes and ears.

126
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:08,900
Yet I, a dull and muddy-mettled rascal,

127
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,780
peak, like John-a-dreams,
unpregnant of my cause,

128
00:08:12,780 --> 00:08:17,580
and can say nothing.
No, not for a king

129
00:08:17,900 --> 00:08:21,980
upon whose property and most dear
life a damn'd defeat was made.

130
00:08:21,980 --> 00:08:26,100
Am I a coward? Who calls me
villain? Breaks my pate across?

131
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,460
Plucks off my beard
and blows it in my face?

132
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,700
Tweaks me by the nose? Gives
me the lie i' the throat

133
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,460
as deep as to the lungs?
Who does me this, ha?

134
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:37,660
'Swounds! I should take it: for it
cannot be but I am pigeon-liver'd,

135
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:40,900
and lack gall to make
oppression bitter, or ere this

136
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:45,460
I should have fatted all the region
kites with this slave's offal,

137
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:48,500
bloody, bawdy villain!

138
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:53,860
Remorseless, treacherous,
lecherous, kindless villain!

139
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:56,500
O, vengeance!

140
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:06,220
Why, what an ass am I!
This is most brave, that I,

141
00:09:06,580 --> 00:09:10,420
the son of a dear father murder'd,

142
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:14,820
prompted to my revenge by heaven
and hell, must, like a whore,

143
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:19,220
unpack my heart with words and fall
a-cursing like a very drab, a scullion!

144
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,020
Fie upon't! Foh! About, my brain!

145
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,580
I have heard that guilty
creatures, sitting at a play,

146
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:30,260
have by the very cunning of the
scene been struck so to the soul

147
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:33,260
that presently they have
proclaim'd their malefactions,

148
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:36,420
for murder, though it have
no tongue, will speak with most

149
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,860
miraculous organ,
I'll have these players play

150
00:09:41,340 --> 00:09:44,140
something like the murder
of my father before mine uncle:

151
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:48,180
I'll observe his looks,
I'll tent him to the quick.

152
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:51,980
If he but blench, I know my course.

153
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:56,820
The spirit that I have
seen may be the devil,

154
00:09:57,260 --> 00:10:01,260
and the devil hath power to
assume a pleasing shape, yea,

155
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:06,460
and perhaps out of my
weakness and my melancholy,

156
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:09,180
as he is very potent with such spirits,

157
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:15,380
abuses me to damn me:

158
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:22,140
I'll have grounds
more relative than this.

159
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,620
The play's the thing wherein I'll catch

160
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:30,380
the conscience of the king.

161
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:37,700
And can you, by no drift of conference,
get from him why he puts on this confusion,

162
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:42,500
grating so harshly all his days of quiet
with turbulent and dangerous lunacy?

163
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,700
He does confess he feels
himself distracted,

164
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,100
but from what cause
he will by no means speak.

165
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:49,540
Nor do we find him
forward to be sounded,

166
00:10:49,540 --> 00:10:52,420
but, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof

167
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:55,500
when we would bring him on to
some confession of his true state.

168
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,060
- Did he receive you well?
- Most like a gentleman.

169
00:10:59,140 --> 00:11:01,940
But with much forcing
of his disposition.

170
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:06,340
Niggard of question, but, of our
demands, most free in his reply.

171
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,420
Did you assay him to any pastime?

172
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:12,020
Madam, it so fell out that certain
players we o'er-raught on the way:

173
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:15,660
of these we told him, and there did
seem in him a kind of joy to hear of it:

174
00:11:15,740 --> 00:11:17,860
they are about the court, and, as I
think, they have already order

175
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:20,540
- this night to play before him.
- 'Tis most true,

176
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:22,140
and he beseech'd me
to entreat your majesties

177
00:11:22,340 --> 00:11:25,380
- to hear and see the matter.
- With all my heart!

178
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:28,100
And it doth much content me
to hear him so inclin'd.

179
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,740
Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
and drive his purpose in to these delights.

180
00:11:31,740 --> 00:11:33,300
We shall, my lord.

181
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,980
Sweet Gertrude, leave us too,

182
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:42,020
for we have closely sent for Hamlet
hither, that he, as 'twere by accident,

183
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:44,060
may here affront Ophelia:

184
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:47,180
her father and myself, lawful espials,

185
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:50,260
will so bestow ourselves
that, seeing, unseen,

186
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:54,660
we may of their encounter frankly judge,
and gather by him, as he is behav'd,

187
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:59,300
if't be the affliction of his love
or no that thus he suffers for.

188
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,100
I shall obey you.

189
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:06,580
And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish

190
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:10,020
that your good beauties be the
happy cause of Hamlet's wildness,

191
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:16,180
so shall I hope your virtues will
bring him to his wonted way again,

192
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:20,940
- to both your honours.
- Madam, I wish it may.

193
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:29,140
Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so
please you, we will bestow ourselves.

194
00:12:29,260 --> 00:12:33,100
Read on this book, that show of such
an exercise may colour your loneliness.

195
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,100
We are oft to blame in this,
'tis too much prov'd,

196
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:38,180
that with devotion's visage
and pious action

197
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:41,860
- we do sugar o'er the Devil himself.
- O, 'tis too true!

198
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:46,820
How smart a lash that speech
doth give my conscience!

199
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:50,500
The harlot's cheek,
beautied with plastering art,

200
00:12:50,620 --> 00:12:54,460
is not more ugly to
the thing that helps it

201
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:57,540
than is my deed

202
00:12:58,340 --> 00:13:01,100
to my most painted word.

203
00:13:02,740 --> 00:13:07,660
- O heavy burden!
- I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.

204
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:46,100
To be, or not to be,

205
00:13:47,980 --> 00:13:50,380
that is the question:

206
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:55,860
whether 'tis nobler in the mind
to suffer the slings and arrows

207
00:13:55,860 --> 00:14:01,860
of outrageous fortune or to take
arms against a sea of troubles,

208
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:07,900
and by opposing end them?
To die, to sleep, no more,

209
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:12,420
and by a sleep to say
we end the heartache,

210
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:16,660
and the thousand natural
shocks that flesh is heir to,

211
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,660
'tis a consummation
devoutly to be wish'd.

212
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:25,700
To die, to sleep...

213
00:14:26,540 --> 00:14:28,340
To sleep!

214
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:32,860
Perchance to dream:
ay, there's the rub,

215
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:38,620
for in that sleep of death
what dreams may come,

216
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:43,780
when we have shuffled off this
mortal coil, must give us pause:

217
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:48,580
there's the respect that
makes calamity of so long life,

218
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:52,740
for who would bear the
whips and scorns of time,

219
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,820
the oppressor's wrong,
the proud man's contumely,

220
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:03,780
the pangs of despis'd
love, the law's delay,

221
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:06,740
the insolence of office, and the spurns

222
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,740
that patient merit
of the unworthy takes,

223
00:15:09,780 --> 00:15:14,740
when he himself might his
quietus make with a bare bodkin?

224
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:17,420
Who would these fardels bear,

225
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:21,380
to grunt and sweat under a weary life,

226
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:26,300
but that the dread

227
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:31,020
of something after death...

228
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:38,580
The undiscover'd country, from
whose bourn no traveller returns,

229
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:41,500
puzzles the will,

230
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,460
and makes us rather
bear those ills we have

231
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:47,380
than fly to others
that we know not of?

232
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:54,140
Thus conscience doth make
cowards of us all, and thus

233
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:56,580
the native hue of resolution

234
00:15:56,580 --> 00:16:01,220
is sicklied o'er with
the pale cast of thought,

235
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:07,340
and enterprises of great pith
and moment, with this regard,

236
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,620
their currents turn awry,

237
00:16:11,100 --> 00:16:13,820
and lose the name

238
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,740
of action.

239
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:22,300
Soft you now! The fair Ophelia!

240
00:16:29,300 --> 00:16:30,860
Nymph...

241
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,460
in thy orisons

242
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,900
be all my sins remember'd.

243
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,500
Good my lord, how does your
honour for this many a day?

244
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:44,100
I humbly thank you.

245
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:47,580
Well,

246
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,460
well,

247
00:16:53,740 --> 00:16:55,260
well.

248
00:17:09,380 --> 00:17:11,140
My lord,

249
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:17,980
I have remembrances of yours that
I have longed long to re-deliver.

250
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:22,260
- I pray you, now receive them.
- No.

251
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:27,340
- Not I, I never gave you aught.
- My honour'd lord,

252
00:17:28,380 --> 00:17:30,420
you know right well you did,

253
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:36,820
and with them words of so sweet breath
compos'd as made the things more rich.

254
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:40,060
Their perfume lost, take these again,

255
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,980
for to the noble mind rich gifts
wax poor when givers prove unkind.

256
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:47,100
There, my lord.

257
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:47,980
Ha?

258
00:17:49,100 --> 00:17:50,300
Ha?

259
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:53,500
- Are you honest?
- My lord?

260
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:56,660
- Are you fair?
- What means your lordship?

261
00:17:56,660 --> 00:18:00,260
That if you be honest and fair, your honesty
should admit no discourse to your beauty.

262
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:02,460
Could beauty, my lord, have
better commerce than with honesty?

263
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:05,340
Ay, truly, for the power of beauty
will sooner transform honesty

264
00:18:05,340 --> 00:18:07,100
from what it is to a bawd
than the force of honesty

265
00:18:07,260 --> 00:18:09,380
can translate beauty into his likeness:

266
00:18:09,580 --> 00:18:13,220
this was sometime a paradox,
but now the time gives it proof.

267
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:23,260
- I did love you once.
- Indeed, my lord,

268
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:27,460
- you made me believe so.
- You should not have believ'd me,

269
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:32,340
for virtue cannot so inoculate our old stock
but we shall relish of it: I loved you not.

270
00:18:33,180 --> 00:18:36,100
- I was the more deceived.
- Get thee to a nunnery.

271
00:18:36,660 --> 00:18:38,820
Why wouldst thou be
a breeder of sinners?

272
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,660
I am myself indifferent honest, but
yet I could accuse me of such things

273
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:44,860
that it were better my mother had not
borne me: I am very proud, revengeful,

274
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:47,060
ambitious, with more
offences at my beck

275
00:18:47,060 --> 00:18:48,940
than I have thoughts to put them in,
imagination to give them shape,

276
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:51,580
or time to act them in.
What should such fellows as I do

277
00:18:51,780 --> 00:18:53,140
crawling between
earth and heaven?

278
00:18:53,140 --> 00:18:57,580
We are arrant knaves, all, believe
none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.

279
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,220
Where's your father?

280
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,460
At home, my lord.

281
00:19:25,300 --> 00:19:29,340
Let the doors be shut upon him,

282
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:36,180
that he may play the fool
nowhere but in's own house.

283
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:39,300
Farewell.

284
00:19:41,540 --> 00:19:43,940
O, help him, you sweet heavens!

285
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:48,620
If thou dost marry, I'll give
thee this plague for thy dowry,

286
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:52,860
be thou as chaste as
ice, as pure as snow,

287
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:57,380
thou shalt not escape calumny.
Get thee to a nunnery, go: farewell.

288
00:19:57,380 --> 00:20:00,260
Or, if thou wilt needs
marry, marry a fool,

289
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,100
for wise men know well enough
what monsters you make of them.

290
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:08,300
To a nunnery, go, and
quickly too. Farewell.

291
00:20:08,380 --> 00:20:10,540
O heavenly powers, restore him!

292
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,700
I have heard of your paintings too,
well enough, God hath given you one face,

293
00:20:15,780 --> 00:20:19,980
and you make yourselves another:
you jig, you amble, and you lisp,

294
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:25,620
and nickname God's creatures, and
make your wantonness your ignorance.

295
00:20:25,780 --> 00:20:30,060
Go to, I'll no more on't,

296
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:33,660
it hath made me mad.

297
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:39,340
I say,

298
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:44,980
we will have no more marriages.

299
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:55,140
Those that are married already,

300
00:20:58,740 --> 00:21:01,820
all but one, shall live.

301
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,540
The rest shall keep as they are.

302
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,340
To a nunnery,

303
00:21:22,980 --> 00:21:24,260
go.

304
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:35,620
O, what a noble mind
is here o'erthrown!

305
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:41,220
The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's,

306
00:21:42,140 --> 00:21:45,340
eye, tongue, sword,

307
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:48,500
the expectancy and
rose of the fair state,

308
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:51,980
the glass of fashion
and the mould of form,

309
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,940
the observ'd of all observers,

310
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:59,580
quite, quite down!

311
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,780
And I, of ladies most
deject and wretched

312
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:09,860
that suck'd the honey of his music vows,

313
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:14,300
now see that noble and
most sovereign reason,

314
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:18,380
like sweet bells jangled,
out of tune and harsh,

315
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:22,700
that unmatch'd form and
feature of blown youth

316
00:22:24,460 --> 00:22:26,900
blasted with ecstasy.

317
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:32,980
O, woe is me, to have
seen what I have seen,

318
00:22:35,820 --> 00:22:38,380
- see what I see!
- Love?

319
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,740
His affections do not that way tend,

320
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,820
nor what he spake, though it lack'd
form a little, was not like madness.

321
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:48,660
There's something in his soul o'er
which his melancholy sits on brood,

322
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:51,900
and I do doubt the hatch and
the disclose Will be some danger:

323
00:22:51,980 --> 00:22:54,980
which for to prevent, I have in
quick determination thus set it down:

324
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:58,540
he shall with speed to England for
the demand of our neglected tribute:

325
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:01,500
haply the seas, and countries
different, with variable objects,

326
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:04,740
shall expel this something-settled
matter in his heart,

327
00:23:04,860 --> 00:23:08,700
whereon his brains still beating
puts him thus from fashion of himself.

328
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:12,100
- What think you on't?
- It shall do well,

329
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,860
but yet do I believe the origin
and commencement of his grief

330
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:17,020
sprung from neglected love.

331
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:23,100
How now, Ophelia! You need not
tell us what Lord Hamlet said,

332
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:25,220
we heard it all.

333
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:29,740
My lord, do as you please,
but if you hold it fit,

334
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:34,460
after the play, let his queen mother
all alone entreat him to show his grief:

335
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:35,820
let her be round with him,

336
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:38,700
and I'll be plac'd, so please you,
in the ear of all their conference.

337
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:41,100
If she find him not,
to England send him,

338
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:43,860
or confine him where your
wisdom best shall think.

339
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:46,060
It shall be so:

340
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:51,860
madness in great ones
must not unwatch'd go.

341
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:16,420
Speak the speech, I pray you,
as I pronounced it to you,

342
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:20,660
trippingly on the tongue: but if you
mouth it, as many of your players do,

343
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,060
I had as lief the town
crier spoke my lines.

344
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:28,180
Nor do not not saw the air too much
with your hand, thus, but use all gently:

345
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:32,540
for in the very torrent, tempest, and,
as I may say, whirlwind of your passion,

346
00:24:32,540 --> 00:24:36,900
you must acquire and beget a
temperance that may give it smoothness.

347
00:24:38,220 --> 00:24:43,140
O, it offends me to the soul, to
hear a robustious periwig-pated fellow

348
00:24:43,140 --> 00:24:45,940
tear a passion to tatters, to very rags,

349
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:49,700
to split the ears of the
groundlings, who, for the most part,

350
00:24:49,700 --> 00:24:53,580
are capable of nothing but
inexplicable dumb shows and noise.

351
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:56,500
I would have such a fellow
whipped for o'erdoing Termagant,

352
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,100
it out-herods Herod:
pray you avoid it.

353
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,580
- I warrant your honour.
- Be not too tame neither, but

354
00:25:02,780 --> 00:25:05,780
let your own discretion be your
tutor: suit the action to the word,

355
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:09,380
the word to the action,
with this special observance,

356
00:25:09,380 --> 00:25:12,980
that you o'erstep not
the modesty of nature:

357
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:17,660
for anything so overdone is
from the purpose of playing,

358
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:21,380
whose end, both at the
first and now, was and is,

359
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:25,020
to hold, as 'twere,
the mirror up to nature,

360
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:28,140
to show virtue her own
feature, scorn her own image,

361
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:33,460
and the very age and body of
the time his form and pressure.

362
00:25:33,540 --> 00:25:36,780
Now, this overdone, or come tardy off,

363
00:25:36,780 --> 00:25:39,780
though it make the unskilful laugh,

364
00:25:39,780 --> 00:25:42,820
cannot but make the judicious grieve,

365
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:45,580
the censure of the which
one must in your allowance,

366
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,300
o'erweigh a whole theatre of others.

367
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:51,540
O, there be players
that I have seen play,

368
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:55,620
and heard others praise, and that
highly, not to speak it profanely,

369
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:58,500
that, neither having
the accent of Christians,

370
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,980
nor the gait of Christian,
pagan, nor man, have so...

371
00:26:02,340 --> 00:26:04,020
strutted and bellowed
that I have thought

372
00:26:04,220 --> 00:26:06,060
some of nature's
journeymen had made men,

373
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:09,500
and not made them well, they
imitated humanity so abominably.

374
00:26:09,500 --> 00:26:12,100
I hope we have reform'd
that indifferently with us.

375
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:17,580
O, reform it altogether. And
let those that play your clowns

376
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:20,060
speak no more than
is set down for them:

377
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,300
for there be of them
that will themselves laugh,

378
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:26,380
to set on some quantity of
barren spectators to laugh too,

379
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:31,140
though in the meantime some
necessary question of the play

380
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:34,060
be then to be considered: that's villanous

381
00:26:34,340 --> 00:26:36,260
and shows a most pitiful ambition

382
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:40,060
in the fool that uses
it. Go make you ready.

383
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:47,620
How now, my lord! Will the
king hear this piece of work?

384
00:26:47,620 --> 00:26:50,980
- And the queen too, and that presently.
- Bid the players make haste.

385
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:55,540
- Will you two help to hasten them?
- We will, my lord.

386
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:02,780
- What, ho, Horatio!
- Here, sweet lord, at your service.

387
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:07,100
Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
as e'er my conversation cop'd withal.

388
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:10,260
- O, my dear lord,
- Nay, do not think I flatter

389
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:13,980
for what advancement may I hope
from thee, that no revenue hast,

390
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:16,980
but thy good spirits,
to feed and clothe thee?

391
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:21,100
Why should the poor be flatter'd?

392
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:26,180
No, let the candied
tongue lick absurd pomp,

393
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:30,660
and crook the pregnant hinges of the
knee where thrift may follow fawning

394
00:27:30,740 --> 00:27:34,900
Dost thou hear? Since my dear
soul was mistress of her choice,

395
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:38,180
and could of men distinguish, her
election hath seal'd thee for herself:

396
00:27:38,180 --> 00:27:41,460
for thou hast been as one, in
suffering all, that suffers nothing,

397
00:27:41,460 --> 00:27:45,740
a man that Fortune's buffets and
rewards hast ta'en with equal thanks:

398
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:50,980
and bles'd are those whose blood
and judgment are so well commingled

399
00:27:50,980 --> 00:27:56,140
that they are not a pipe for Fortune's
finger to sound what stop she please.

400
00:27:56,340 --> 00:28:01,500
Give me that man that
is not passion's slave,

401
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:05,340
and I will wear him in my heart's core,

402
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:10,500
ay, in my heart of heart,

403
00:28:11,500 --> 00:28:13,980
as I do thee.

404
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:22,380
Something too much of this. There
is a play to-night before the king,

405
00:28:22,460 --> 00:28:26,540
one scene of it comes near the circumstance,
which I have told thee, of my father's death:

406
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:29,260
I pr'ythee, when thou
see'st that act a-foot,

407
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,820
even with the very comment
of thy soul observe mine uncle.

408
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,540
If his occulted guilt do not
itself unkennel in one speech,

409
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,780
it is a damned ghost
that we have seen, and my

410
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:43,460
imaginations are as foul
as Vulcan's stithy.

411
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:47,980
Give him heedful note, for I
mine eyes will rivet to his face,

412
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:52,500
and, after, we will both our judgments
join in censure of his seeming.

413
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:54,740
Well, my lord:

414
00:28:55,380 --> 00:29:00,220
if he steal aught the whilst this
play is playing, and scape detecting,

415
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,820
I will pay the theft.

416
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:08,460
They are coming to the play. I
must be idle: get you a place.

417
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:26,940
- How fares our cousin Hamlet?
- Excellent, i' faith,

418
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:31,700
of the chameleon's dish: I
eat the air, promise-crammed.

419
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:33,620
You cannot feed capons so.

420
00:29:33,620 --> 00:29:37,500
I have nothing with this answer,
Hamlet, these words are not mine.

421
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:39,500
No, nor mine now.

422
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:42,540
My lord,

423
00:29:46,180 --> 00:29:49,620
you play'd once i' the
university, you say?

424
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:52,580
That did I, my lord, and
was accounted a good actor.

425
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:56,940
- What did you enact?
- I did enact Julius Caesar,

426
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:01,940
I was kill'd i' the
Capitol, Brutus killed me.

427
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:06,620
It was a brute part of him
to kill so capital a calf there.

428
00:30:13,180 --> 00:30:16,660
- Be the players ready?
- Ay, my lord, they stay upon your patience.

429
00:30:20,300 --> 00:30:22,980
Come hither, my good Hamlet, sit by me.

430
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,700
No, good mother, here's
metal more attractive.

431
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:28,460
O, ho! Do you mark that?

432
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:31,300
- Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
- No, my lord.

433
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:32,900
- I mean, my head upon your lap?
- Ay, my lord.

434
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,260
- Do you think I meant country matters?
- I think nothing, my lord.

435
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:37,260
That's a fair thought to
lie between maids' legs.

436
00:30:37,260 --> 00:30:38,940
- What is, my lord?
- Nothing.

437
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:41,980
- You are merry, my lord.
- Who, I? O, your only jig-maker!

438
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:44,900
What should a man do but be merry? For
look you how cheerfully my mother looks,

439
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:46,980
and my father died within 's two hours.

440
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,900
Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.

441
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:52,820
So long?

442
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:56,260
Nay then, let the devil wear black,
for I'll have a suit of sables.

443
00:30:56,260 --> 00:30:59,460
O heavens! die two months
ago, and not forgotten yet?

444
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:02,620
Then there's hope a great man's memory
may outlive his life half a year:

445
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:06,780
but, by'r lady, he must build churches then,
or else shall he suffer not thinking on,

446
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:09,060
with the hobby-horse,
whose epitaph is

447
00:31:09,260 --> 00:31:12,620
'For, O, for, O, the
hobby-horse is forgot!'

448
00:31:33,620 --> 00:31:35,860
- What means this, my lord?
- Marry, this is miching mallecho,

449
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:37,220
it means mischief.

450
00:31:39,620 --> 00:31:41,660
Belike this show imports
the argument of the play.

451
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:44,140
We shall know by this fellow:

452
00:31:44,420 --> 00:31:46,940
the players cannot keep
counsel, they'll tell all.

453
00:31:47,100 --> 00:31:47,820
Will he tell us what
this show meant?

454
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:49,100
Ay, or any show
that you'll show him:

455
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,700
show, he'll not shame
to tell you what it means.

456
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:53,340
You are naught, you are naught:

457
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:56,900
- I'll mark the play.
- For us, and for our tragedy,

458
00:31:56,980 --> 00:32:01,020
Here stooping to your clemency,
We beg your hearing patiently.

459
00:32:01,020 --> 00:32:03,700
Is this a prologue,
or the posy of a ring?

460
00:32:03,700 --> 00:32:06,380
- 'Tis brief, my lord.
- As woman's love.

461
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:13,260
Full thirty times hath
Phoebus' cart gone round

462
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:17,420
Neptune's salt wash and
Tellus' orbed ground,

463
00:32:17,420 --> 00:32:21,420
and thirty dozen moons
with borrow'd sheen

464
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:25,340
about the world have
times twelve thirties been,

465
00:32:25,340 --> 00:32:29,700
since love our hearts,
and Hymen did our hands,

466
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:33,780
unite commutual in most sacred bands.

467
00:32:33,780 --> 00:32:36,140
So many journeys may the sun and moon

468
00:32:36,140 --> 00:32:39,100
make us again count
o'er ere love be done!

469
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:43,500
but, woe is me, you are so sick of late, so
far from cheer and from your former state

470
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,740
that I distrust you. Yet,

471
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:49,700
though I distrust, discomfort
you, my lord, it nothing must:

472
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:52,820
for women's fear and
love hold quantity,

473
00:32:52,820 --> 00:32:55,780
in either naught, or in extremity.

474
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,900
Now, what my love is,
proof hath made you know,

475
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:02,380
and as my love is siz'd, my fear is so:

476
00:33:02,540 --> 00:33:05,860
where love is great, the
littlest doubts are fear,

477
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:09,140
where little fears grow great,
great love grows there.

478
00:33:09,180 --> 00:33:13,940
Faith, I must leave thee,
love, and shortly too,

479
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,860
my operant powers their
functions leave to do:

480
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:22,660
and thou shalt live in
this fair world behind,

481
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,940
honour'd, belov'd,
and haply one as kind

482
00:33:25,940 --> 00:33:29,060
- for husband shalt thou,
- O, confound the rest!

483
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:32,060
Such love must needs
be treason in my breast:

484
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:34,580
in second husband
let me be accurst!

485
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,900
None wed the second
but who kill'd the first.

486
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:41,500
- That's wormwood, wormwood.
- The instances that second marriage move

487
00:33:41,700 --> 00:33:45,020
are base respects of
thrift, but none of love.

488
00:33:45,220 --> 00:33:47,460
A second time
I kill my husband dead

489
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:49,820
when second husband
kisses me in bed.

490
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:52,300
I do believe you think
what now you speak,

491
00:33:52,300 --> 00:33:54,980
but what we do
determine oft we break.

492
00:33:54,980 --> 00:33:57,660
Purpose is but
the slave to memory,

493
00:33:57,660 --> 00:34:00,660
of violent birth,
but poor validity:

494
00:34:00,820 --> 00:34:05,180
which now, like fruit
unripe, sticks on the tree,

495
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,900
but fall unshaken
when they mellow be.

496
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:10,900
Most necessary
'tis that we forget

497
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:14,380
to pay ourselves what
to ourselves is debt:

498
00:34:14,540 --> 00:34:17,540
what to ourselves
in passion we propose,

499
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:20,700
the passion ending,
doth the purpose lose.

500
00:34:20,700 --> 00:34:23,620
The violence of either grief or joy

501
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:26,700
their own enactures
with themselves destroy:

502
00:34:26,700 --> 00:34:30,260
where joy most revels,
grief doth most lament,

503
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,780
grief joys, joy grieves,
on slender accident.

504
00:34:35,020 --> 00:34:39,780
This world is not for aye,

505
00:34:39,900 --> 00:34:45,260
and 'tis not strange that even our
loves should with our fortunes change,

506
00:34:45,380 --> 00:34:48,380
for 'tis a question
left us yet to prove,

507
00:34:48,540 --> 00:34:51,940
whether love lead fortune,
or else fortune love.

508
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:55,820
The great man down,
you'll mark his favourite flies,

509
00:34:56,020 --> 00:34:58,940
poor men advanc'd
make friends of enemies,

510
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:02,420
and hitherto does love
on fortune tend:

511
00:35:02,740 --> 00:35:05,740
for who not needs
shall never lack a friend,

512
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,860
and who in want
a hollow friend doth try,

513
00:35:09,860 --> 00:35:13,220
directly seasons him his enemy.

514
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:17,820
But, orderly to end where I begun,

515
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:21,340
our wills and fates
do so contrary run

516
00:35:21,540 --> 00:35:24,340
that our devices
still are overthrown,

517
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:29,340
our thoughts are ours,
their ends none of our own:

518
00:35:29,500 --> 00:35:34,380
so think thou wilt
no second husband wed,

519
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:39,820
but die thy thoughts
when thy first lord is dead.

520
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:42,300
Nor earth to me give
food, nor heaven light!

521
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:45,380
sport and repose lock
from me day and night!

522
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:48,620
To desperation
turn my trust and hope!

523
00:35:48,740 --> 00:35:51,860
An anchor's cheer
in prison be my scope!

524
00:35:52,060 --> 00:35:54,260
Each opposite that
blanks the face of joy

525
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:56,900
meet what I would have
well, and it destroy!

526
00:35:56,980 --> 00:36:01,060
Both here and hence
pursue me lasting strife,

527
00:36:01,820 --> 00:36:05,980
if, once a widow, ever I be wife!

528
00:36:06,300 --> 00:36:08,140
If she should break it now!

529
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:11,940
'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet,
leave me here awhile,

530
00:36:12,140 --> 00:36:17,180
my spirits grow dull,
and fain I would beguile

531
00:36:17,420 --> 00:36:21,180
the tedious day with sleep.

532
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:27,700
Sleep rock thy brain, and never
come mischance between us twain!

533
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:41,100
- Madam, how like you this play?
- The lady does protests too much, methinks.

534
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,660
O, but she'll keep her word.

535
00:36:42,860 --> 00:36:45,260
Have you heard the argument?
Is there no offence in't?

536
00:36:45,420 --> 00:36:48,820
No, no! They do but jest, poison
in jest, no offence i' the world.

537
00:36:48,820 --> 00:36:52,300
- What do you call the play?
- "The Mouse-trap". Marry, how?

538
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:55,460
Tropically. This play is the
image of a murder done in Vienna:

539
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,900
Gonzago is the duke's name,
his wife, Baptista, you shall see anon,

540
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:00,100
'tis a knavish piece of work:
but what o' that?

541
00:37:00,300 --> 00:37:03,060
Your majesty, and we that
have free souls, it touches us not:

542
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:06,260
let the gall'd jade wince,
our withers are unwrung.

543
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:09,380
This is one Lucianus,
nephew to the King.

544
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:10,860
You are a good chorus, my lord.

545
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:13,500
I could interpret between you and your
love, if I could see the puppets dallying.

546
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,580
You are keen, my lord.
You are keen.

547
00:37:15,740 --> 00:37:17,300
It would cost you a groaning
to take off my edge.

548
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:20,740
- Still better, and worse.
- So you must take your husbands.

549
00:37:20,820 --> 00:37:25,220
Begin, murderer, pox, leave
thy damnable faces, and begin.

550
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:29,980
Come: 'The croaking raven
doth bellow for revenge.'

551
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:33,340
Thoughts black, hands apt,

552
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:36,500
drugs fit, and time agreeing,

553
00:37:36,620 --> 00:37:39,580
confederate season,
else no creature seeing,

554
00:37:39,660 --> 00:37:43,020
thou mixture rank, of
midnight weeds collected,

555
00:37:43,060 --> 00:37:46,300
with Hecate's ban thrice
blasted, thrice infected,

556
00:37:46,460 --> 00:37:49,380
thy natural magic and dire property

557
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:53,340
on wholesome life usurp immediately.

558
00:37:53,540 --> 00:37:56,260
He poisons him i' the
garden for's estate.

559
00:37:56,460 --> 00:38:00,180
His name's Gonzago: the story is extant,
and written in very choice Italian,

560
00:38:00,340 --> 00:38:02,740
you shall see anon
how the murderer

561
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:06,260
gets the love of Gonzago's wife!

562
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,140
The king rises!

563
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:15,460
What, frighted with false fire!

564
00:38:15,660 --> 00:38:17,980
- How fares my lord?
- Give o'er the play!

565
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:26,020
Give me some light.

566
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:31,260
- Away!
- Lights, lights, lights!

567
00:38:34,100 --> 00:38:35,580
Horatio!

568
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:37,740
Horatio!

569
00:38:39,340 --> 00:38:45,060
Why, let the strucken deer go
weep, the hart ungalled play,

570
00:38:45,220 --> 00:38:49,940
for some must watch, while some
must sleep: thus runs the world away.

571
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,780
Would not this, sir,
and a forest of feathers

572
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,700
if the rest of my fortunes
turn Turk with me,

573
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,580
with two Provincial
roses on my razed shoes,

574
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,900
get me a fellowship
in a cry of players?

575
00:38:58,060 --> 00:38:59,660
- Half a share.
- A whole one, I.

576
00:38:59,820 --> 00:39:01,700
For thou dost know, o Damon dear,

577
00:39:01,900 --> 00:39:05,420
this realm dismantled
was of Jove himself,

578
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:09,500
- and now reigns here a very, very pajock.
- You might have rhymed.

579
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,100
O good Horatio,

580
00:39:11,260 --> 00:39:15,460
I'll take the ghost's word for
a thousand pound! Didst perceive?

581
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:18,660
- Very well, my lord.
- Upon the talk of the poisoning?

582
00:39:18,860 --> 00:39:23,060
- I did very well note him.
- Ah, ha!

583
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,900
Come, some music!
Come, the recorders!

584
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:30,340
For if the king like not the comedy,
why then, belike he likes it not, perdy.

585
00:39:30,540 --> 00:39:32,220
Come, some music!

586
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,420
Good my lord, vouchsafe
me a word with you.

587
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,980
- Sir, a whole history.
- The king, sir...

588
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:38,100
- Ay, sir, what of him?
- Is, in his retirement,

589
00:39:38,300 --> 00:39:39,140
marvellous distempered.

590
00:39:39,220 --> 00:39:41,100
- With drink, sir?
- No, my lord, rather with choler.

591
00:39:41,140 --> 00:39:44,060
Your wisdom should show itself more
richer to signify this to his doctor.

592
00:39:44,260 --> 00:39:45,900
For, for me to put him
to his purgation

593
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:47,980
might perhaps plunge him
into far more choler.

594
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,620
Good my lord, put your
discourse into some frame,

595
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,980
- and start not so wildly from my affair.
- I am tame, sir: pronounce.

596
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:58,260
The queen, your mother, in most great
affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you.

597
00:39:58,300 --> 00:39:59,340
- You are welcome.
- Nay, good my lord,

598
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:01,620
this courtesy is not
of the right breed.

599
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,580
If it shall please you to make
me a wholesome answer,

600
00:40:03,780 --> 00:40:05,980
I will do your mother's
commandment: if not...

601
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:08,300
your pardon and my return
shall be the end of my business.

602
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:11,380
- Sir, I cannot.
- What, my lord?

603
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:15,060
Make you a wholesome
answer, my wit's diseased:

604
00:40:15,260 --> 00:40:18,620
but, sir, such answer as I
can make, you shall command,

605
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:23,060
or rather, as you say, my
mother: therefore no more,

606
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:26,220
but to the matter:
my mother, you say,

607
00:40:26,420 --> 00:40:27,900
Then thus she says:

608
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:31,460
your behaviour hath struck her
into amazement and admiration.

609
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,860
O wonderful son, that
can so stonish a mother!

610
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:37,300
But is there no sequel at the heels
of this mother's admiration? Impart.

611
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:39,980
She desires to speak with you
in her closet ere you go to bed.

612
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:43,100
We shall obey, were she
ten times our mother.

613
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:46,060
Have you any further
trade with us?

614
00:40:46,140 --> 00:40:48,420
- My lord, you once did love me.
- And so I do still,

615
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:50,500
by these pickers and stealers.

616
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:54,060
Good my lord, what is
the cause of your distemper?

617
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:56,500
You do, surely, bar the door
upon your own liberty

618
00:40:56,700 --> 00:40:58,340
if you deny your griefs
to your friend.

619
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:01,580
- Sir, I lack advancement.
- How can that be,

620
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:04,460
when you have the voice of the king
himself for your succession in Denmark?

621
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:07,740
Ay, sir, but 'While the grass grows'
the proverb is something musty.

622
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:11,220
O, the recorders: let me see
one. To withdraw with you:

623
00:41:11,300 --> 00:41:14,460
why do you go about to
recover the wind of me,

624
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:17,060
as if you would
drive me into a toil?

625
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,420
O my lord, if my duty be too
bold, my love is too unmannerly.

626
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:24,780
I do not well understand that.
Will you play upon this pipe?

627
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:26,300
- My lord, I cannot.
- I pray you.

628
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,820
- Believe me, I cannot.
- I do beseech you.

629
00:41:29,020 --> 00:41:31,820
- I know, no touch of it, my lord.
- 'Tis as easy as lying.

630
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,620
Govern these ventages with your finger
and thumb, give it breath with your mouth,

631
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:37,260
and it will discourse most eloquent
music. Look you, these are the stops.

632
00:41:37,460 --> 00:41:41,140
But these cannot I command to any
utterance of harmony, I have not the skill.

633
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:44,780
Why, look you now, how unworthy
a thing you would make of me!

634
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:47,740
You would play upon me, you
would seem to know my stops,

635
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:50,860
you would pluck out
the heart of my mystery,

636
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:54,180
you would sound me from my lowest
note to the top of my compass,

637
00:41:54,340 --> 00:41:58,060
and there is much music, excellent
voice, in this little organ,

638
00:41:58,260 --> 00:42:00,260
yet cannot you make it speak.

639
00:42:00,460 --> 00:42:04,620
'Sblood, do you think I am easier
to be played upon than a pipe?

640
00:42:04,820 --> 00:42:08,580
Call me what instrument you will!
Though you can fret me,

641
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,860
yet, you cannot play upon me.
God bless you, sir!

642
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:13,260
My lord, the queen would
speak with you, and presently.

643
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,700
Do you see yonder cloud that's
almost in shape of a camel?

644
00:42:16,860 --> 00:42:18,340
By the mass, and 'tis
like a camel indeed.

645
00:42:18,340 --> 00:42:20,460
- Methinks it is like a weasel.
- It is backed like a weasel.

646
00:42:20,460 --> 00:42:22,580
- Or like a whale.
- Very like a whale.

647
00:42:22,780 --> 00:42:24,980
Then will I come
to my mother by and by.

648
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,100
They fool me to the top of my
bent. I will come by and by.

649
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,420
- I will say so.
- By-and-by is easily said.

650
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:35,380
Leave me, friends.

651
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:50,340
I like him not, nor stands it safe
with us to let his madness range.

652
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:54,020
Therefore prepare you, I your
commission will forthwith dispatch,

653
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:56,940
and he to England shall along with you:

654
00:42:57,340 --> 00:43:00,300
the terms of our estate may not
endure hazard so dangerous

655
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:02,460
as doth hourly
grow out of his lunacies.

656
00:43:02,660 --> 00:43:04,580
We will ourselves provide:

657
00:43:04,740 --> 00:43:07,260
most holy and religious fear it is

658
00:43:07,380 --> 00:43:11,300
to keep those many many bodies safe
that live and feed upon your majesty.

659
00:43:11,380 --> 00:43:15,220
The single and peculiar life is bound, by
all the strength and armour of the mind,

660
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:17,980
to keep itself from 'noyance,

661
00:43:18,140 --> 00:43:22,820
but much more that spirit upon whose
weal depend and rest the lives of many.

662
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:29,060
The cease of majesty dies not alone, but
like a gulf doth draw what's near it with it:

663
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:31,900
it is a massy wheel, fix'd on
the summit of the highest mount,

664
00:43:31,940 --> 00:43:35,740
to whose huge spokes ten thousand
lesser things are mortis'd and adjoin'd,

665
00:43:35,900 --> 00:43:38,380
which, when it falls,
each small annexment,

666
00:43:38,580 --> 00:43:41,660
petty consequence,
attends the boisterous ruin.

667
00:43:42,180 --> 00:43:45,740
Never alone did the king
sigh, but with a general groan.

668
00:43:45,820 --> 00:43:48,180
Arm you, I pray you,
to this speedy voyage,

669
00:43:48,340 --> 00:43:51,860
for we will fetters put upon this
fear, which now goes too free-footed.

670
00:43:51,940 --> 00:43:54,140
- We will haste us.
- My lord...

671
00:43:56,740 --> 00:43:59,460
he's going to his mother's closet:
behind the arras I'll convey myself

672
00:43:59,460 --> 00:44:02,020
to hear the process, I'll
warrant she'll tax him home:

673
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:04,300
and, as you said,
and wisely was it said,

674
00:44:04,500 --> 00:44:06,700
'tis meet that some more
audience than a mother,

675
00:44:06,900 --> 00:44:09,820
since nature makes them partial,
should o'erhear the speech, of vantage.

676
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,500
Fare you well, my liege: I'll call upon you
ere you go to bed, and tell you what I know.

677
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:15,380
Thanks, dear my lord.

678
00:44:15,700 --> 00:44:19,380
'Tis now the very witching time
of night, when churchyards yawn,

679
00:44:19,420 --> 00:44:22,500
and hell itself breathes
out contagion to this world:

680
00:44:22,940 --> 00:44:27,540
now could I drink hot blood, and
do such bitter business as the day

681
00:44:27,620 --> 00:44:29,940
would quake to look on.

682
00:44:30,460 --> 00:44:34,460
Soft! Now to my mother.

683
00:44:34,540 --> 00:44:36,500
O heart, lose not thy nature,

684
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,940
let not ever the soul of
Nero enter this firm bosom:

685
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:43,420
let me be cruel, not unnatural,

686
00:44:43,580 --> 00:44:47,660
I will speak daggers
to her, but use none,

687
00:44:47,740 --> 00:44:51,220
my tongue and soul
in this be hypocrites,

688
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:55,140
how in my words
somever she be shent,

689
00:44:55,380 --> 00:45:00,620
to give them seals
never, my soul, consent!

690
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:05,060
O, my offence is rank,
it smells to heaven,

691
00:45:05,780 --> 00:45:08,260
it hath the primal eldest curse upon't,

692
00:45:09,180 --> 00:45:11,140
a brother's murder!

693
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:16,540
Pray can I not, though
inclination be as sharp as will:

694
00:45:17,100 --> 00:45:19,980
my stronger guilt
defeats my strong intent,

695
00:45:20,980 --> 00:45:25,780
and, like a man to double business bound,
I stand in pause where I shall first begin,

696
00:45:25,780 --> 00:45:27,420
and both neglect.

697
00:45:28,740 --> 00:45:33,700
What if this cursed hand were thicker
than itself with brother's blood?

698
00:45:34,020 --> 00:45:38,380
Is there not rain enough in the sweet
heaven to wash it white as snow?

699
00:45:38,540 --> 00:45:43,020
Whereto serves mercy but to
confront the visage of offence?

700
00:45:43,460 --> 00:45:46,900
And what's in prayer
but this twofold force,

701
00:45:46,980 --> 00:45:51,860
to be forestalled ere we come
to fall, or pardon'd being down?

702
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:56,500
Then I'll look up, my fault is past.

703
00:45:57,940 --> 00:46:01,300
But, o, what form of
prayer can serve my turn?

704
00:46:02,300 --> 00:46:06,820
Forgive me my foul
murder! That cannot be,

705
00:46:07,100 --> 00:46:10,820
since I am still possess'd of those
effects for which I did the murder,

706
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:16,660
my crown, mine own
ambition, and my queen.

707
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:21,180
May one be pardon'd
and retain the offence?

708
00:46:22,300 --> 00:46:27,580
In the corrupted currents of this world
offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,

709
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:31,660
and oft 'tis seen the wicked
prize itself buys out the law,

710
00:46:33,060 --> 00:46:37,100
but 'tis not so above,
there is no shuffling,

711
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,540
there the action lies
in his true nature,

712
00:46:40,660 --> 00:46:42,340
and we ourselves compell'd,

713
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:46,020
even to the teeth and forehead
of our faults, to give in evidence.

714
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,260
What then? What rests?

715
00:46:51,420 --> 00:46:54,860
Try what repentance
can: what can it not?

716
00:46:57,220 --> 00:47:02,940
Yet what can it when one cannot repent?

717
00:47:03,460 --> 00:47:07,460
O wretched state! O
bosom black as death!

718
00:47:07,540 --> 00:47:12,060
O limed soul, that, struggling
to be free, art more engag'd!

719
00:47:13,740 --> 00:47:18,780
Help, angels! Make assay:

720
00:47:21,140 --> 00:47:23,140
bow, stubborn knees,

721
00:47:24,700 --> 00:47:29,780
and, heart, with strings of steel, be
soft as sinews of the new-born babe!

722
00:47:30,820 --> 00:47:32,460
All may be well.

723
00:47:35,540 --> 00:47:38,500
Now might I do it pat,

724
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:46,220
now he is praying, and now I'll do't,

725
00:47:47,300 --> 00:47:51,060
and so he goes to heaven,

726
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,500
and so am I reveng'd.

727
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,260
That would be scann'd:

728
00:48:00,580 --> 00:48:04,580
a villain kills my father,
and for that, I, his sole son,

729
00:48:04,580 --> 00:48:07,340
do this same villain send to heaven?

730
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:12,900
O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.

731
00:48:13,180 --> 00:48:15,740
He took my father
grossly, full of bread,

732
00:48:15,780 --> 00:48:18,780
with all his crimes broad
blown, as flush as May,

733
00:48:18,820 --> 00:48:21,580
and how his audit stands,
who knows save heaven?

734
00:48:21,660 --> 00:48:25,180
But in our circumstance and course
of thought, 'tis heavy with him:

735
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:30,380
and am I, then, reveng'd, to take
him in the purging of his soul,

736
00:48:30,460 --> 00:48:33,300
when he is fit and
season'd for his passage?

737
00:48:33,940 --> 00:48:35,700
No!

738
00:48:37,740 --> 00:48:42,340
Up, sword, and know
thou a more horrid hent:

739
00:48:42,780 --> 00:48:46,940
when he is drunk, asleep, or in his rage,

740
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:51,700
or in the incestuous pleasure
of his bed, at gaming, at swearing,

741
00:48:51,860 --> 00:48:55,340
or about some act that has
no relish of salvation in't,

742
00:48:55,380 --> 00:48:59,660
then trip him, that his
heels may kick at heaven,

743
00:48:59,820 --> 00:49:05,500
and that his soul may be as damn'd
and black as hell, whereto it goes.

744
00:49:06,020 --> 00:49:08,260
My mother stays:

745
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:13,540
this physic but
prolongs thy sickly days.

746
00:49:14,300 --> 00:49:19,020
My words fly up, my
thoughts remain below:

747
00:49:19,420 --> 00:49:23,140
words without thoughts
never to heaven go.

748
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:32,300
He will come straight.
Look you lay home to him:

749
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,900
tell him his pranks have
been too broad to bear with,

750
00:49:35,020 --> 00:49:37,660
and that your grace hath screen'd
and stood between much heat and him.

751
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:40,460
I'll silence me even here.
Pray you, be round with him.

752
00:49:40,460 --> 00:49:43,220
- I'll warrant you, fear me not!
- Mother, mother, mother!

753
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:44,940
Withdraw, I hear him coming.

754
00:49:47,620 --> 00:49:49,260
Now, mother, what's the matter?

755
00:49:49,380 --> 00:49:51,660
Hamlet, thou hast
thy father much offended.

756
00:49:51,860 --> 00:49:53,660
Mother, you have
my father much offended.

757
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,660
Come, come, you answer
with an idle tongue.

758
00:49:55,860 --> 00:49:57,500
Go, go, you question
with a wicked tongue.

759
00:49:57,700 --> 00:49:58,700
- Why, how now, Hamlet!
- What's the matter now?

760
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:00,780
- Have you forgot me?
- No, by the rood, not so:

761
00:50:00,780 --> 00:50:03,500
you are the queen, your
husband's brother's wife,

762
00:50:03,580 --> 00:50:05,620
and, would it were not
so, you are my mother...

763
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:08,260
Nay, then, I'll set those
to you that can speak.

764
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:10,860
Come, come, and sit you
down, you shall not budge,

765
00:50:11,060 --> 00:50:15,060
you go not till I set you up a glass
where you may see the inmost part of you.

766
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,740
What wilt thou do?
Thou wilt not murder me?

767
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:21,980
- Help, help, ho!
- What, ho! help, help, help!

768
00:50:22,740 --> 00:50:25,340
Dead, for a ducat, dead!

769
00:50:26,420 --> 00:50:28,220
O, I am slain!

770
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:36,140
O me, what hast thou done?

771
00:50:37,100 --> 00:50:38,900
Nay, I know not: is it the king?

772
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,340
O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!

773
00:50:41,420 --> 00:50:44,820
A bloody deed! Almost as bad, good mother,
as kill a king, and marry with his brother.

774
00:50:44,980 --> 00:50:47,940
- As kill a king!
- Ay, lady, 'twas my word.

775
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:58,980
Thou wretched, rash,
intruding fool, farewell!

776
00:51:00,780 --> 00:51:04,460
I took thee for thy
better: take thy fortune,

777
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:08,140
thou find'st to be too
busy is some danger.

778
00:51:10,300 --> 00:51:12,940
Leave wringing of your hands.

779
00:51:13,220 --> 00:51:16,700
Peace! Sit you down,
and let me wring your heart

780
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:19,100
for so I shall, if it be
made of penetrable stuff,

781
00:51:19,220 --> 00:51:23,740
if damned custom have not brass'd it so
that it is proof and bulwark against sense.

782
00:51:23,940 --> 00:51:27,660
What have I done, that thou darest wag
thy tongue in noise so rude against me?

783
00:51:27,860 --> 00:51:31,180
Such an act that blurs the
grace and blush of modesty,

784
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:32,820
calls virtue hypocrite,

785
00:51:33,020 --> 00:51:37,820
takes off the rose from the fair forehead
of an innocent love and sets a blister there,

786
00:51:38,020 --> 00:51:40,700
makes marriage-vows
as false as dicers' oaths:

787
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:44,580
o, such a deed as from the body of
contraction plucks the very soul,

788
00:51:44,780 --> 00:51:47,220
and sweet religion makes
a rhapsody of words:

789
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,860
heaven's face doth glow:

790
00:51:48,900 --> 00:51:52,380
yea, this solidity and compound mass,

791
00:51:52,540 --> 00:51:56,460
with tristful visage, as against
the doom, is thought-sick at the act!

792
00:51:56,500 --> 00:52:02,180
Ay me, what act, that roars so
loud, and thunders in the index?

793
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:06,380
Look here, upon this
picture, and on this,

794
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,220
the counterfeit
presentment of two brothers.

795
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:12,980
See, what a grace was
seated on this brow,

796
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,740
Hyperion's curls, the
front of Jove himself,

797
00:52:16,820 --> 00:52:19,780
an eye like Mars, to
threaten and command,

798
00:52:19,940 --> 00:52:24,580
a station like the herald Mercury
new-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill,

799
00:52:24,860 --> 00:52:30,060
a combination and a form indeed, where
every god did seem to set his seal,

800
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:33,980
to give the world assurance of a man:

801
00:52:35,180 --> 00:52:38,980
this was your husband.
Look you now, what follows:

802
00:52:39,020 --> 00:52:43,020
here is your husband,
like a mildew'd ear,

803
00:52:43,060 --> 00:52:46,580
blasting his wholesome
brother. Have you eyes?

804
00:52:46,860 --> 00:52:52,020
Could you on this fair mountain leave
to feed, and batten on this moor?

805
00:52:53,020 --> 00:52:55,500
Ha! have you eyes? You
cannot call it love,

806
00:52:55,540 --> 00:52:57,700
for at your age the hey-day
in the blood is tame,

807
00:52:57,900 --> 00:52:59,700
it's humble, and waits
upon the judgment:

808
00:52:59,900 --> 00:53:02,460
and what judgment would
step from this to this?

809
00:53:02,660 --> 00:53:05,060
Sense, sure, you have, else
could you not have motion,

810
00:53:05,060 --> 00:53:08,500
but sure, that sense is apoplex'd,
for madness would not err,

811
00:53:08,540 --> 00:53:13,020
nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
but it reserved some quantity of choice,

812
00:53:13,220 --> 00:53:15,180
to serve in such a difference.

813
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:19,260
What devil was't that thus hath
cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?

814
00:53:19,460 --> 00:53:22,820
Eyes without feeling, feeling without
sight, ears without hands or eyes,

815
00:53:22,980 --> 00:53:28,420
smelling sans all, or but a
sickly part of one true sense

816
00:53:28,620 --> 00:53:30,420
could not so mope.

817
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:33,620
O shame!

818
00:53:33,940 --> 00:53:35,860
Where is thy blush?

819
00:53:36,340 --> 00:53:41,580
Rebellious hell, if thou canst
mutine in a matron's bones,

820
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:44,460
to flaming youth let virtue be as wax,

821
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:47,900
and melt in her own
fire: proclaim no shame

822
00:53:47,940 --> 00:53:51,100
when the compulsive
ardour gives the charge,

823
00:53:51,300 --> 00:53:55,460
since frost itself as actively
doth burn and reason panders will!

824
00:53:55,660 --> 00:53:58,860
O Hamlet, speak no more: thou
turn'st mine eyes into my very soul,

825
00:53:58,900 --> 00:54:03,180
and there I see such black and grained
spots as will not leave their tinct.

826
00:54:03,380 --> 00:54:06,660
Nay, but to live in the rank
sweat of an enseamed bed,

827
00:54:06,860 --> 00:54:10,740
stew'd in corruption, honeying
and making love over the nasty sty,

828
00:54:10,900 --> 00:54:15,100
O, speak to me no more, these words,
like daggers, enter in mine ears!

829
00:54:15,300 --> 00:54:18,420
- No more, sweet Hamlet!
- A murderer and a villain,

830
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:21,740
a slave that is not twentieth part
the tithe of your precedent lord,

831
00:54:21,940 --> 00:54:25,540
a vice of kings, a cutpurse
of the empire and the rule,

832
00:54:25,620 --> 00:54:29,740
that from a shelf the precious diadem
stole, and put it in his pocket!

833
00:54:29,780 --> 00:54:34,540
- No more!
- A king of shreds and patches!

834
00:54:42,300 --> 00:54:43,900
Save me,

835
00:54:44,060 --> 00:54:47,820
and hover o'er me with your
wings, you heavenly guards!

836
00:54:47,980 --> 00:54:51,460
- What would your gracious figure?
- Alas, he's mad!

837
00:54:51,660 --> 00:54:56,020
Do you not come
your tardy son to chide,

838
00:54:56,340 --> 00:54:58,700
that, lapsed in time and passion,

839
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:04,740
lets go by the important
acting of your dread command?

840
00:55:05,380 --> 00:55:09,300
- O, say!
- Do not forget:

841
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:14,060
this visitation is but to whet

842
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:18,180
thy almost blunted purpose.

843
00:55:18,380 --> 00:55:23,700
But, look, amazement on thy mother sits.

844
00:55:24,340 --> 00:55:29,260
O, step between her
and her fighting soul.

845
00:55:29,460 --> 00:55:33,900
Conceit in weakest bodies

846
00:55:34,060 --> 00:55:36,860
strongest works.

847
00:55:37,460 --> 00:55:40,340
Speak to her, Hamlet.

848
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:45,380
- How is it with you, lady?
- Alas, how is't with you,

849
00:55:45,580 --> 00:55:51,220
that you do bend your eye on vacancy and
with the incorporal air do hold discourse?

850
00:55:52,740 --> 00:55:55,180
Forth at your eyes your
spirits wildly peep,

851
00:55:55,300 --> 00:55:59,340
and, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
your bedded hair, like life in excrements,

852
00:55:59,380 --> 00:56:01,380
starts up, and stands on end.

853
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:06,460
O gentle son, upon the heat
and flame of thy distemper

854
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:08,500
sprinkle cool patience.

855
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:12,860
Whereon do you look?

856
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:15,780
On him.

857
00:56:17,340 --> 00:56:19,140
On him!

858
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,700
Look you, how pale he glares!

859
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:27,500
His form and cause conjoin'd,
preaching to stones,

860
00:56:27,580 --> 00:56:31,300
would make them capable.
Do not look upon me,

861
00:56:31,380 --> 00:56:35,260
lest with this piteous action
you convert my stern effects:

862
00:56:36,060 --> 00:56:38,540
then what I have to do
will want true colour,

863
00:56:39,060 --> 00:56:41,460
tears perchance for blood.

864
00:56:41,540 --> 00:56:43,980
- To whom do you speak this?
- Do you see nothing there?

865
00:56:44,060 --> 00:56:47,260
- Nothing at all, yet all that is I see.
- Nor did you nothing hear?

866
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,340
- No, nothing but ourselves.
- Why, look you there!

867
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:53,060
Look, how it steals away!
My father, in his habit as he lived!

868
00:56:53,140 --> 00:56:55,780
Look, where he goes,
even now, out at the portal!

869
00:56:55,980 --> 00:56:58,860
This the very
coinage of your brain:

870
00:56:59,060 --> 00:57:02,460
this bodiless creation
ecstasy is very cunning in.

871
00:57:02,740 --> 00:57:04,420
Ecstasy!

872
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:14,500
My pulse, as yours, doth
temperately keep time,

873
00:57:14,740 --> 00:57:19,420
and makes as healthful music: it
is not madness that I have utter'd:

874
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:22,540
bring me to the test, and
I the matter will re-word,

875
00:57:22,620 --> 00:57:27,260
which madness would gambol from.
Mother, for love of grace...

876
00:57:27,420 --> 00:57:30,700
lay not that flattering
unction to your soul,

877
00:57:30,780 --> 00:57:34,980
that not your trespass,
but my madness speaks:

878
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:38,260
it will but skin and
film the ulcerous place,

879
00:57:38,340 --> 00:57:42,460
whilst rank corruption, mining
all within, infects unseen.

880
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:47,020
Confess yourself to
heaven, repent what's past,

881
00:57:47,140 --> 00:57:52,460
avoid what is to come, and do not spread the
compost on the weeds, to make them ranker.

882
00:57:52,980 --> 00:57:55,060
Forgive me this my virtue,

883
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,820
for in the fatness of these pursy times
virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,

884
00:58:00,940 --> 00:58:04,140
yea, curb and woo for
leave to do him good.

885
00:58:04,220 --> 00:58:05,980
O Hamlet...

886
00:58:07,620 --> 00:58:10,020
thou hast cleft my heart in twain.

887
00:58:10,220 --> 00:58:12,340
O, throw away the worser part of it,

888
00:58:12,420 --> 00:58:15,180
and live the purer with the other half.

889
00:58:15,620 --> 00:58:19,820
Good night: but go not
to mine uncle's bed,

890
00:58:19,900 --> 00:58:22,220
assume a virtue, if you have it not.

891
00:58:22,300 --> 00:58:24,940
That monster, custom,
who all sense doth eat,

892
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:27,660
of habits devil, is angel yet in this,

893
00:58:27,740 --> 00:58:29,740
that to the use of actions
fair and good

894
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:33,660
he likewise gives a frock or
livery, that aptly is put on.

895
00:58:33,940 --> 00:58:37,660
Refrain to-night, and that shall lend a
kind of easiness to the next abstinence:

896
00:58:37,700 --> 00:58:41,500
the next more easy, for use almost
can change the stamp of nature,

897
00:58:41,540 --> 00:58:45,940
and either shame the devil, or
throw him out with wondrous potency.

898
00:58:46,860 --> 00:58:48,660
Once more, good night:

899
00:58:49,180 --> 00:58:51,540
and when you are
desirous to be bless'd,

900
00:58:53,300 --> 00:58:55,820
I'll blessing beg of you.

901
00:58:57,660 --> 00:59:00,260
For this same lord, I do repent,

902
00:59:00,380 --> 00:59:04,540
but heaven hath pleased it so,
to punish me with this and this with me,

903
00:59:04,780 --> 00:59:08,380
that I must be their
scourge and minister.

904
00:59:09,380 --> 00:59:11,140
I will bestow him,

905
00:59:12,220 --> 00:59:14,980
and will answer well
the death I gave him.

906
00:59:16,460 --> 00:59:18,380
So, again, good night.

907
00:59:20,460 --> 00:59:23,100
I must be cruel, only to be kind:

908
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:25,940
thus bad begins

909
00:59:27,340 --> 00:59:29,380
and worse remains behind.

910
00:59:30,580 --> 00:59:34,700
- One word more, good lady.
- What shall I do?

911
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,940
Not this, by no means,
that I bid you do:

912
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:41,740
let the bloat king
tempt you again to bed,

913
00:59:42,020 --> 00:59:45,180
pinch wanton on your
cheek, call you his mouse,

914
00:59:45,380 --> 00:59:48,300
and let him, for a pair
of reechy kisses, or

915
00:59:48,500 --> 00:59:50,580
paddling in your neck
with his damn'd fingers,

916
00:59:50,780 --> 00:59:54,340
make you to ravel all this matter out,
that I essentially am not in madness,

917
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:59,540
but mad in craft. 'Twere
good you let him know,

918
01:00:00,340 --> 01:00:04,820
for who, that's but a
queen, fair, sober, wise,

919
01:00:04,940 --> 01:00:09,780
would from a paddock, from a bat,
a gib, such dear concernings hide?

920
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:13,260
Who would do so? No, in
despite of sense and secrecy,

921
01:00:13,260 --> 01:00:17,380
unpeg the basket on the
house's top. Let the birds fly,

922
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:21,500
and, like the famous
ape, to try conclusions,

923
01:00:21,780 --> 01:00:26,260
in the basket creep, and
break your own neck down.

924
01:00:26,340 --> 01:00:27,900
Be thou assured,

925
01:00:29,780 --> 01:00:33,820
if words be made of
breath, and breath of life,

926
01:00:34,020 --> 01:00:37,500
I have no life to breathe
what thou hast said to me.

927
01:00:37,780 --> 01:00:40,820
I must to England, you know that?

928
01:00:41,740 --> 01:00:43,660
Alack, I had forgot.

929
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:49,300
- 'Tis so concluded on.
- There's letters seal'd,

930
01:00:49,820 --> 01:00:54,780
and my two schoolfellows, whom I
will trust as I will adders fang'd,

931
01:00:55,060 --> 01:00:58,980
they bear the mandate, they must sweep
my way, and marshal me to knavery.

932
01:00:59,060 --> 01:01:04,420
Let it work, for 'tis the sport to have
the engineer hoist with his own petard:

933
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,180
and 't shall go hard

934
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:11,020
but I will delve one
yard below their mines,

935
01:01:11,900 --> 01:01:14,660
and blow them at the moon.

936
01:01:15,860 --> 01:01:20,660
O, 'tis most sweet, when in one
line two crafts directly meet.

937
01:01:22,020 --> 01:01:27,140
This man shall set me packing: I'll
lug the guts into the neighbour room.

938
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:30,340
Mother, good night indeed.

939
01:01:39,980 --> 01:01:45,660
This counsellor is now most still,
most secret and most grave,

940
01:01:46,500 --> 01:01:50,860
who was in life
a foolish prating knave.

941
01:01:53,060 --> 01:01:54,540
Come, sir,

942
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:57,820
to draw toward an end with you.

943
01:02:00,780 --> 01:02:02,380
Good night, mother.

944
01:02:22,660 --> 01:02:26,220
There's matter in these
sighs, these profound heaves:

945
01:02:26,300 --> 01:02:29,260
you must translate: 'tis fit we
understand them. Where is your son?

946
01:02:29,340 --> 01:02:31,540
Bestow this place on us a little while.

947
01:02:32,580 --> 01:02:34,500
Ah, my good lord,
what have I seen to-night!

948
01:02:34,700 --> 01:02:37,340
What, Gertrude?
How does Hamlet?

949
01:02:37,620 --> 01:02:41,580
Mad as the sea and wind, when
both contend which is the mightier.

950
01:02:42,700 --> 01:02:47,900
In his lawless fit, behind the
arras hearing something stir,

951
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:52,060
whips out his rapier,
cries, 'A rat, a rat!'

952
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:54,700
and, in this brainish apprehension,

953
01:02:55,100 --> 01:02:59,980
kills the unseen good old man.

954
01:03:00,340 --> 01:03:02,260
O heavy deed!

955
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:07,180
It had been so with us,
had we been there!

956
01:03:21,580 --> 01:03:26,820
His liberty is full of threats to all,
to you yourself, to us, to every one.

957
01:03:27,420 --> 01:03:32,020
Alas, how shall this
bloody deed be answer'd?

958
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,060
It will be laid to us,

959
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:36,740
whose providence should
have kept short, restrain'd and...

960
01:03:36,940 --> 01:03:39,620
out of haunt, this mad young man.

961
01:03:40,060 --> 01:03:44,220
But so much was our love, we would
not understand what was most fit,

962
01:03:44,740 --> 01:03:47,980
but, like the owner of a foul
disease, to keep it from divulging,

963
01:03:48,020 --> 01:03:50,260
let it feed even on the pith of life.

964
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:55,060
- Where is he gone?
- To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:

965
01:03:55,260 --> 01:04:00,580
o'er whom his very madness, like some
ore among a mineral of metals base,

966
01:04:00,660 --> 01:04:03,380
shows itself pure, he
weeps for what is done.

967
01:04:03,580 --> 01:04:05,900
O Gertrude, come away!

968
01:04:06,260 --> 01:04:09,260
The sun no sooner shall the mountains
touch, but we will ship him hence:

969
01:04:09,620 --> 01:04:14,940
and this vile deed we must,
with all our majesty and skill,

970
01:04:14,980 --> 01:04:17,380
both countenance and excuse.

971
01:04:17,980 --> 01:04:20,660
Ho, Guildenstern! Friends both,
go join you with some further aid.

972
01:04:20,780 --> 01:04:23,060
Hamlet in madness
hath Polonius slain,

973
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,220
and from his mother's closet
hath he dragg'd him.

974
01:04:25,420 --> 01:04:28,300
Go seek him out, speak fair, and
bring the body into the chapel.

975
01:04:28,500 --> 01:04:30,300
Come on! I pray you, haste in this!

976
01:04:33,180 --> 01:04:36,820
Come, Gertrude, we'll
call up our wisest friends,

977
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:41,220
and let them know, both what we
mean to do, and what's untimely done.

978
01:04:41,900 --> 01:04:45,500
So envious slander, whose
whisper o'er the world's diameter

979
01:04:45,580 --> 01:04:48,460
as level as the cannon to his
blank, transports the poisoned shot

980
01:04:48,500 --> 01:04:52,300
may miss our name
and hit the woundless air.

981
01:04:53,380 --> 01:04:54,940
O, come away!

982
01:04:57,380 --> 01:05:00,820
My soul is full of discord and dismay.

983
01:05:16,260 --> 01:05:18,300
- Safely stowed.
- Hamlet! Lord Hamlet!

984
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,020
But soft, what noise?
Who calls on Hamlet?

985
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:23,980
- Hamlet!
- O, here they come.

986
01:05:26,580 --> 01:05:28,220
What have you done, my lord,
with the dead body?

987
01:05:28,420 --> 01:05:30,340
Compounded it with dust,
whereto 'tis kin.

988
01:05:30,540 --> 01:05:32,460
Tell us where 'tis, that we may take
it thence and bear it to the chapel.

989
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:33,700
- Do not believe it.
- Believe what?

990
01:05:33,780 --> 01:05:38,220
That I can keep your counsel and not mine
own. Besides, to be demanded of a sponge!

991
01:05:38,260 --> 01:05:40,580
What replication should be
made by the son of a king?

992
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,100
Take you me for a sponge, my lord?

993
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:45,580
Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's
countenance, his rewards, his authorities.

994
01:05:45,620 --> 01:05:48,620
But such officers do the
king best service in the end.

995
01:05:48,660 --> 01:05:51,740
He keeps them, like an ape,
an apple, in the corner of his jaw,

996
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:54,500
first mouthed, to be last swallowed.

997
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:57,980
When he needs what you have
gleaned, it is but squeezing you,

998
01:05:58,060 --> 01:06:02,220
- and, sponge, you shall be dry again.
- I understand you not, my lord.

999
01:06:02,260 --> 01:06:05,060
I am glad of it: a knavish
speech sleeps in a foolish ear.

1000
01:06:05,100 --> 01:06:07,460
My lord, you must tell us where the
body is, and go with us to the king.

1001
01:06:07,500 --> 01:06:09,980
The body is with the king, but
the king is not with the body.

1002
01:06:10,020 --> 01:06:13,060
- The king is a thing...
- A thing, my lord!

1003
01:06:13,260 --> 01:06:15,460
...of nothing. Bring me to him.

1004
01:06:15,980 --> 01:06:19,220
- My lord!
- Hide fox, and all after.

1005
01:06:20,140 --> 01:06:21,300
My lord!

1006
01:06:22,100 --> 01:06:23,620
My good lord Hamlet!

1007
01:06:24,100 --> 01:06:25,260
My good lord!

1008
01:06:26,140 --> 01:06:27,060
Hamlet!

1009
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,340
I have sent to seek him,
and to find the body.

1010
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:44,820
How dangerous is it
that this man goes loose!

1011
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:50,180
Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
he's loved of the distracted multitude,

1012
01:06:50,460 --> 01:06:53,140
who like not in their
judgment, but their eyes,

1013
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:57,740
and, where 'tis so, the offender's scourge
is weigh'd, but never the offence.

1014
01:06:58,260 --> 01:07:02,420
To bear all smooth and even,
this sudden sending him away

1015
01:07:02,420 --> 01:07:04,940
must seem deliberate pause.

1016
01:07:05,420 --> 01:07:10,420
Diseases desperate grown by desperate
appliance are relieved, or not at all.

1017
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:13,700
How now! What hath befall'n?

1018
01:07:13,900 --> 01:07:16,140
Where the dead body is bestow'd,
my lord, we cannot get from him.

1019
01:07:16,340 --> 01:07:17,620
- But where is he?
- Without, my lord,

1020
01:07:17,820 --> 01:07:19,700
- guarded, to know your pleasure.
- Bring him before us.

1021
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:22,300
Ho, Guildenstern! Bring in my lord.

1022
01:07:25,060 --> 01:07:27,380
- Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
- At supper.

1023
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:32,180
- At supper! Where?
- Not where he eats, but where he is eaten.

1024
01:07:32,260 --> 01:07:35,780
A certain convocation of
politic worms are e'en at him.

1025
01:07:35,900 --> 01:07:38,220
Your worm is your only emperor for diet:

1026
01:07:38,300 --> 01:07:42,860
we fat all creatures else to fat
us, and we fat ourselves for maggots:

1027
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:46,340
your fat king and your lean
beggar is but variable service,

1028
01:07:46,340 --> 01:07:48,820
two dishes, but to one
table That's the end.

1029
01:07:48,860 --> 01:07:51,220
- Alas, alas!
- A man may fish with the worm

1030
01:07:51,220 --> 01:07:54,660
that hath eat of a king, and eat of
the fish that hath fed of that worm.

1031
01:07:54,700 --> 01:07:57,620
- What dost you mean by this?
- Nothing but to show you how a king

1032
01:07:57,700 --> 01:08:00,140
may go a progress through
the guts of a beggar.

1033
01:08:00,140 --> 01:08:02,340
Where is Polonius?

1034
01:08:03,820 --> 01:08:06,340
In heaven. Send hither to see...

1035
01:08:06,460 --> 01:08:08,820
If your messenger
find him not there,

1036
01:08:08,980 --> 01:08:11,700
seek him i' the other place
yourself. But if indeed

1037
01:08:11,900 --> 01:08:12,860
you find him not within this month,

1038
01:08:12,940 --> 01:08:18,020
you shall nose him as you
go up the stairs into the lobby.

1039
01:08:18,540 --> 01:08:20,260
Go seek him there.

1040
01:08:21,060 --> 01:08:24,020
- He will stay till ye come.
- Hamlet...

1041
01:08:24,700 --> 01:08:27,220
this deed, for thine especial
safety, which we do tender,

1042
01:08:27,300 --> 01:08:29,780
as we dearly grieve for
that which thou hast done,

1043
01:08:30,020 --> 01:08:33,540
must send thee hence with fiery
quickness. Therefore prepare thyself,

1044
01:08:33,620 --> 01:08:36,700
the bark is ready, and the wind at help,
the associates tend, and every thing

1045
01:08:36,900 --> 01:08:38,260
- is bent for England.
- For England!

1046
01:08:38,460 --> 01:08:39,780
- Ay, Hamlet.
- Good.

1047
01:08:39,940 --> 01:08:43,580
- So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
- I see a cherub that sees them.

1048
01:08:44,100 --> 01:08:47,020
But, come, for England!
Farewell, dear mother.

1049
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,060
- Thy loving father, Hamlet.
- Mother.

1050
01:08:50,420 --> 01:08:54,940
Father and mother is man and
wife. Man and wife is one flesh,

1051
01:08:55,100 --> 01:08:59,220
and so, my mother.

1052
01:08:59,540 --> 01:09:03,500
Come, for England!

1053
01:09:08,740 --> 01:09:10,500
Follow him at foot, tempt
him with speed aboard,

1054
01:09:10,700 --> 01:09:12,500
delay it not, I'll have him
hence to-night. Away!

1055
01:09:12,660 --> 01:09:14,900
For every thing is seal'd and done
that else leans on the affair.

1056
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,620
Pray you, make haste!

1057
01:09:17,700 --> 01:09:21,300
And, England, if my love
thou hold'st at aught

1058
01:09:21,580 --> 01:09:24,100
as my great power thereof
may give thee sense,

1059
01:09:24,100 --> 01:09:26,780
since yet thy cicatrice looks raw
and red after the Danish sword,

1060
01:09:26,940 --> 01:09:29,100
and thy free awe
pays homage to us

1061
01:09:29,380 --> 01:09:33,180
thou mayst not coldly set our sovereign
process, which imports at full,

1062
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:37,900
by letters congruing to that
effect, the present death of Hamlet.

1063
01:09:39,820 --> 01:09:45,020
Do it, England, for like the
hectic in my blood he rages,

1064
01:09:45,060 --> 01:09:49,100
and thou must cure me!
Till I know 'tis done,

1065
01:09:49,420 --> 01:09:53,900
howe'er my haps, my
joys were ne'er begun.

1066
01:10:39,580 --> 01:10:44,100
Go, captain, from me
greet the Danish king.

1067
01:10:44,540 --> 01:10:48,820
Tell him that, by his licence,
Fortinbras craves the conveyance

1068
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:52,820
of a promised march over his
kingdom. You know the rendezvous.

1069
01:10:53,620 --> 01:10:57,260
If that his majesty would aught with us,

1070
01:10:58,660 --> 01:11:01,580
we shall express our duty in his eye,

1071
01:11:02,260 --> 01:11:04,620
- and let him know so.
- I will do't, my lord.

1072
01:11:04,660 --> 01:11:08,300
Go softly on.

1073
01:11:23,420 --> 01:11:27,180
- Good sir, whose powers are these?
- They are of Norway, sir.

1074
01:11:27,260 --> 01:11:30,260
- How purposed, sir, I pray you?
- Against some part of Poland.

1075
01:11:30,340 --> 01:11:34,620
- Who commands them, sir?
- The nephew of old Norway, Fortinbras.

1076
01:11:34,820 --> 01:11:36,740
Goes it against
the main of Poland, sir, or...

1077
01:11:36,940 --> 01:11:39,260
- for some frontier?
- Truly to speak,

1078
01:11:40,260 --> 01:11:41,700
and with no addition,

1079
01:11:42,500 --> 01:11:47,620
we go to gain a little patch of ground
that hath in it no profit but the name.

1080
01:11:47,900 --> 01:11:52,700
To pay five ducats,
five, I would not farm it,

1081
01:11:53,220 --> 01:11:57,580
nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
a ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.

1082
01:11:57,660 --> 01:12:03,100
- Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
- Yes, it is already garrison'd.

1083
01:12:03,420 --> 01:12:06,820
Two thousand souls and
twenty thousand ducats

1084
01:12:06,900 --> 01:12:09,780
will not debate the
question of this straw.

1085
01:12:12,580 --> 01:12:15,820
This is the imposthume
of much wealth and peace,

1086
01:12:15,860 --> 01:12:21,220
that inward breaks, and shows
no cause without why the man dies.

1087
01:12:24,460 --> 01:12:27,620
- I humbly thank you, sir.
- God be wi' you, sir.

1088
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:31,300
- Wilt please you go, my lord?
- I'll be with you straight.

1089
01:12:31,860 --> 01:12:33,740
Go a little before.

1090
01:12:38,260 --> 01:12:42,060
How all occasions do inform against me,

1091
01:12:42,260 --> 01:12:45,700
and spur my dull revenge!

1092
01:12:48,940 --> 01:12:51,380
What is a man,

1093
01:12:52,980 --> 01:12:58,420
if his chief good and market of
his time be but to sleep and feed?

1094
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:00,980
A beast, no more.

1095
01:13:01,940 --> 01:13:05,220
Sure, he that made us
with such large discourse,

1096
01:13:05,420 --> 01:13:08,700
looking before and after,
gave us not that

1097
01:13:08,900 --> 01:13:14,220
capability and god-like reason
to fust in us unused!

1098
01:13:14,260 --> 01:13:20,220
Now, whether it be bestial
oblivion, or some craven scruple

1099
01:13:20,380 --> 01:13:23,060
of thinking too precisely on the event,

1100
01:13:23,220 --> 01:13:28,340
a thought which, quarter'd, hath but one
part wisdom and ever three parts coward,

1101
01:13:28,420 --> 01:13:34,580
I do not know why yet I live
to say 'This thing's to do',

1102
01:13:34,900 --> 01:13:39,820
sith I have cause and will
and strength and means to do't.

1103
01:13:40,660 --> 01:13:44,580
Examples gross as earth exhort me:

1104
01:13:45,380 --> 01:13:50,620
witness this army of
such mass and charge

1105
01:13:50,780 --> 01:13:54,100
led by a delicate and tender prince,

1106
01:13:54,220 --> 01:13:58,460
whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd

1107
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:01,500
makes mouths at the invisible event,

1108
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:04,060
exposing what is mortal and unsure

1109
01:14:04,260 --> 01:14:07,860
to all that fortune,
death and danger dare,

1110
01:14:08,100 --> 01:14:11,980
even for an egg-shell.

1111
01:14:12,100 --> 01:14:16,620
Rightly to be great is not
to stir without great argument,

1112
01:14:16,700 --> 01:14:20,100
but greatly to find quarrel in a straw

1113
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:22,580
when honour's at the stake.

1114
01:14:23,140 --> 01:14:29,340
How stand I then, that have a
father kill'd, a mother stain'd,

1115
01:14:29,500 --> 01:14:32,500
excitements of my reason and my blood,

1116
01:14:32,660 --> 01:14:37,180
and let all sleep? While, to my shame,

1117
01:14:37,340 --> 01:14:42,740
I see the imminent death
of twenty thousand men,

1118
01:14:42,820 --> 01:14:45,900
that, for a fantasy and trick of fame,

1119
01:14:45,980 --> 01:14:48,860
go to their graves like beds,

1120
01:14:49,060 --> 01:14:54,420
fight for a plot whereon the
numbers cannot try the cause,

1121
01:14:54,540 --> 01:15:00,380
which is not tomb enough
and continent to hide the slain?

1122
01:15:01,020 --> 01:15:03,980
O, from this time forth,

1123
01:15:04,300 --> 01:15:08,060
my thoughts be bloody,

1124
01:15:08,300 --> 01:15:11,460
or be nothing worth!

1125
01:15:25,150 --> 01:15:29,350
When sorrows come, they
come not single spies

1126
01:15:29,430 --> 01:15:31,390
but in battalions.

1127
01:15:31,550 --> 01:15:34,750
First, her father slain,
next, your son gone

1128
01:15:34,830 --> 01:15:37,550
and he most violent author
of his own just remove,

1129
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,510
the people muddied, thick and unwholesome
in their thoughts and whispers,

1130
01:15:40,590 --> 01:15:45,150
for good Polonius' death and we have done
but greenly, in hugger-mugger to inter him.

1131
01:15:45,230 --> 01:15:48,590
Poor Ophelia divided from
herself and her fair judgment,

1132
01:15:48,710 --> 01:15:51,550
without the which we are
pictures, or mere beasts.

1133
01:15:51,670 --> 01:15:55,950
Last, and as much containing as all these,
her brother is in secret come from France

1134
01:15:56,030 --> 01:15:58,150
feeds on his wonder,
keeps himself in clouds,

1135
01:15:58,310 --> 01:15:59,950
and wants not buzzers to infect his ear

1136
01:16:00,150 --> 01:16:03,630
with pestilent speeches of his father's
death wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,

1137
01:16:03,750 --> 01:16:06,790
will nothing stick our person
to arraign in ear and ear.

1138
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:10,590
O my dear Gertrude, this, like to
a murdering-piece, in many places

1139
01:16:10,670 --> 01:16:13,030
gives me superfluous death.

1140
01:16:27,310 --> 01:16:30,190
- I will not speak with her.
- She is importunate,

1141
01:16:30,310 --> 01:16:34,390
indeed distract, her
mood will needs be pitied.

1142
01:16:34,550 --> 01:16:37,590
- What would she have?
- She speaks much of her father

1143
01:16:37,990 --> 01:16:41,830
says she hears there's tricks i' the
world and hems, and beats her heart

1144
01:16:41,950 --> 01:16:46,750
spurns enviously at straws speaks things
in doubt, that carry but half sense.

1145
01:16:46,910 --> 01:16:51,830
Her speech is nothing, yet the unshaped use
of it doth move the hearers to collection

1146
01:16:51,870 --> 01:16:55,990
they aim at it, and botch the words
up fit to their own thoughts which,

1147
01:16:56,070 --> 01:16:58,910
as her winks, and nods,
and gestures yield them,

1148
01:16:58,990 --> 01:17:01,990
indeed would make one think
there might be thought,

1149
01:17:02,070 --> 01:17:04,750
though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.

1150
01:17:04,830 --> 01:17:08,870
'Twere good she were spoken with for
she may strew dangerous conjectures

1151
01:17:08,950 --> 01:17:12,710
- in ill-breeding minds.
- Let her come in.

1152
01:17:21,430 --> 01:17:25,470
To my sick soul,
as sin's true nature is,

1153
01:17:26,510 --> 01:17:30,430
each toy seems prologue
to some great amiss,

1154
01:17:32,470 --> 01:17:36,470
so full of artless jealousy is guilt,
it spills itself in fearing to be spilt.

1155
01:17:37,350 --> 01:17:42,990
Where is the beauteous
majesty of Denmark?

1156
01:17:45,030 --> 01:17:48,870
- How now, Ophelia!
- How should I your true love know

1157
01:17:48,990 --> 01:17:50,710
from another one?

1158
01:17:50,870 --> 01:17:54,750
By his cockle hat and
staff, and his sandal shoon.

1159
01:17:55,270 --> 01:17:58,310
Alas, sweet lady,
what imports this song?

1160
01:17:58,390 --> 01:18:01,030
Say you? Nay,

1161
01:18:02,950 --> 01:18:05,070
pray you, mark.

1162
01:18:06,870 --> 01:18:10,710
He is dead and gone, lady,
he is dead and gone

1163
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:14,990
at his head a grass-green turf,
at his heels a stone.

1164
01:18:15,230 --> 01:18:17,550
- Nay, but, Ophelia,
- Pray you, mark.

1165
01:18:18,510 --> 01:18:22,550
- White his shroud as the mountain snow,
- Alas, look here, my lord.

1166
01:18:23,750 --> 01:18:26,110
Larded with sweet flowers,

1167
01:18:26,230 --> 01:18:30,830
which bewept to the grave
did go with true-love showers.

1168
01:18:30,990 --> 01:18:32,990
How do you, pretty lady?

1169
01:18:34,190 --> 01:18:39,790
Well, God 'ild you! They say
the owl was a baker's daughter.

1170
01:18:39,990 --> 01:18:44,190
Lord, we know what we are,
but know not what we may be.

1171
01:18:46,350 --> 01:18:50,630
- God be at your table!
- Conceit upon her father.

1172
01:18:51,030 --> 01:18:53,470
Pray you!

1173
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:55,710
Let's have no words of this!
