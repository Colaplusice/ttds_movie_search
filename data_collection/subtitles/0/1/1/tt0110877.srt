{3955}{3998}No, there's no water, Dad.
{4011}{4103}It's all gone,|since this morning.
{4107}{4159}I wanted to rinse my hands too...
{4190}{4246}...all gone.
{4333}{4353}Is it still warm?
{4500}{4559}I've got a bad cold this morning...
{4608}{4702}It must have been the dampness|on the boat.
{4730}{4805}I only have to set foot|on that boat--
{4826}{4899}Perhaps I'm allergic.
{4920}{5003}Even if the boat's not moving,|the dampness gets to me.
{5022}{5110}I don't know how you can|stay on it all night...
{5149}{5181}and not catch a thing.
{5260}{5297}The minute I get on--
{5388}{5460}I've received a postcard|from America, Dad...
{5465}{5540}from Gaetano and Alfredo.
{5579}{5650}This is America|around the outside...
{5651}{5696}and this is an American car.
{5728}{5770}They say they're|going to buy one, too.
{5778}{5842}It's written here:|''We're buying one.''
{5842}{5892}But I think they're joking...
{5924}{5965}because they cost|a load of money.
{5965}{6065}But they say|it's a rich country...
{6065}{6150}where there's work, a country--
{6155}{6188}and we're still here...
{6198}{6254}without water...
{6267}{6307}while they're--
{6369}{6394}Forget it, never mind.
{6433}{6517}Listen, Mario,|you've never liked fishing.
{6535}{6569}I've caught a chill.
{6587}{6639}Go to America or Japan|if you want to...
{6667}{6701}but get yourself a job.
{6725}{6760}You're not a kid anymore.
{7817}{7875}''The poet, Pablo Neruda, in Rome.''
{7893}{7929}Central Station.
{7937}{8052}A group of rowdy people|has inconvenienced the travellers...
{8052}{8125}who crowd the station platforms|every day.
{8138}{8167}These protesters...
{8179}{8218}are not drunkards...
{8247}{8341}nor the usual hotheads|who protest just for the fun of it.
{8352}{8435}They are a group of intellectuals,|writers and journalists.
{8447}{8491}Why have they joined|together, shouting...
{8494}{8554}disturbing the police|and Carabinieri?
{8562}{8611}The mystery is revealed|when the train arrives.
{8632}{8682}Pablo Neruda gets out|at Rome station...
{8698}{8775}the Chilean poet known throughout|the world for his poetry...
{8779}{8882}and his communist ideas which|have often got him into trouble...
{8891}{8934}and for which|he has now been exiled.
{8949}{9003}The poet appears to be|well-loved in Italy...
{9014}{9110}and, judging by the enthusiastic|embrace of this pretty woman...
{9122}{9174}not only for his moral gifts.
{9189}{9246}Women go crazy for his poetry...
{9259}{9336}maybe because Neruda|writes love poems...
{9340}{9449}a topic which appeals|to the female sensibility.
{9463}{9509}But let's go back|to our noisy crowd.
{9523}{9610}The Home Office|has accepted their protest...
{9610}{9669}by suspending the measures|against Neruda...
{9669}{9711}requested by|the Chilean government.
{9725}{9771}The poet will remain|in Italy...
{9771}{9865}on a wonderful island.
{9866}{9965}He will not be able to leave|without police authority...
{9965}{10036}but the island's beauty|will make exile easier.
{10036}{10107}Hey! That's me! That's me!
{10141}{10233}The poet will have happy memories|of Italy and its government...
{10238}{10344}which is hosting him in a place|which will remind him of home.
{10355}{10422}This cozy house|surrounded by nature...
{10422}{10498}will certainly make him|feel at home.
{10990}{11062}''Wanted: Temporary Postman|with Bicycle''
{12339}{12384}My deepest sympathy, Donna Rosa
{12384}{12470}Thank you, thank you Mr. Di Cosimo
{12505}{12560}We needed such a man in this village.
{12612}{12630}He will be missed
{12675}{12714}And now they even send communists here...
{12744}{12806}Such is life, Mr. Di Cosimo...
{13240}{13314}...You, Anita Scotto,|are the sender.
{13314}{13371}And this is your son's name, okay?
{13433}{13468}I've come about the job.
{13474}{13549}Right, wait.|...And this is the city.
{13561}{13578}That's all.
{13586}{13615}Are you sending him capers?
{13642}{13671}He'll be pleased.
{13842}{13865}Are you illiterate?
{13887}{13954}No, I can read and write.
{13989}{14039}Not very fast, but--
{14084}{14102}Sit down.
{14282}{14353}I need someone to deliver mail|to Cala di Sotto.
{14378}{14434}That's great.|I live there.
{14462}{14493}There's only one addressee.
{14512}{14547}Only one?
{14564}{14633}Everyone else there is illiterate.
{14666}{14729}I'm not illiterate, but still--
{14733}{14774}Well, then.
{14820}{14905}It's all mail|for signor Pablo Neruda.
{14925}{14997}Pablo Neruda.|Pablo Neruda, the poet loved by women?
{15009}{15064}Pablo Neruda the poet loved by the people!
{15085}{15197}By the people, but also by women.|I heard it on the newsreel.
{15223}{15296}All right, but most of all|by the people. He's a communist.
{15305}{15319}Right?
{15377}{15492}Okay. The poet has received a mountain|of mail these last two days.
{15514}{15601}Pedalling with the bag is like|carrying an elephant on your back.
{15621}{15645}I'll wait here.
{15657}{15683}I'll be right with you.
{15704}{15720}Listen,
{15751}{15790}The wage is a pittance, you know.
{15815}{15881}Postmen make do with their tips.
{15881}{15909}But with only one house...
{15923}{15992}at most it'll pay for|your cinema once a week.
{16015}{16056}- That's fine.|- It suits you anyway.
{16082}{16132}Well then.|My name's Giorgio.
{16177}{16242}I'm your superior,|and you should call me sir.
{16259}{16335}But I won't hold you to it,|because I'm a communist, too.
{16372}{16405}And remember...
{16422}{16445}the poet...
{16466}{16527}is a great and kind person.
{16567}{16597}He deserves respect.
{16621}{16682}You say hello, you thank him.
{16692}{16748}If he tips you,|you thank him again.
{16763}{16795}- Right?|- Yes, right.
{16802}{16853}This is your hat.
{16879}{16904}This is your bag.
{16919}{16991}Today's the 15th.|Your first payday's the 27th.
{17005}{17048}Oh, another thing...
{17048}{17083}These are the keys.
{17094}{17148}You open in the morning|and close in the evening.
{17175}{17200}- Okay?|- Okay.
{17281}{17317}When do you start?
{17359}{17486}Monday morning.|6:45, I open the shutters.
{17494}{17563}Then the public comes later.
{17639}{17664}Are you in uniform already?
{17724}{17789}No, I'm just wearing the hat.
{17804}{17903}That way it'll|take its shape better...
{17903}{17982}or I'll get a headache|wearing it all day.
{17982}{18060}The boss told me|it's a postman's trick.
{18070}{18089}A llttle trick of ours.
{19338}{19376}Good morning.
{19384}{19456}Good morning. Your mail...
{20069}{20117}- Amor?|- Yes?
{20155}{20186}- Is there anything for me?
{20193}{20255}- No, there's nothing for you
{20842}{20892}- Thank you.|- Thank you.
{21132}{21180}Another one from a female.
{21215}{21233}Female.
{21288}{21327}Maria Conchita, female.
{21382}{21415}Angela, female.
{21466}{21602}Jean Marie... Jean Marie, is that|male or female?
{21630}{21644}Female.
{21652}{21682}Female,|I knew it!
{21713}{21736}This one, too.
{21778}{21839}Even the women are interested|in politics in Chile!
{21890}{22018}I know, but all females... how come?|...Female.
{22064}{22086}Listen...
{22115}{22153}but what's Don Pablo...
{22181}{22194}like?
{22224}{22243}Is he normal?
{22253}{22300}As a person, as--
{22329}{22425}Normal. Of course,|he talks differently.
{22435}{22520}You can tell immediately from--
{22533}{22631}Know what he calls his wife?|''Amor''!
{22651}{22714}Even if he's standing far away...
{22717}{22771}they call each other ''amor.''
{22775}{22814}- Really?|- He's a poet.
{22814}{22871}That's how you can tell.
{22916}{22943}Female.
{23686}{23706}Good morning.
{23772}{23789}Thank you.
{23789}{23864}Thank you. Excuse me...
{23870}{23938}if you happen to need anything...
{23952}{24017}milk, bread, I can--
{24021}{24047}No, thank you.
{24069}{24113}Matilde goes shopping every day.
{24169}{24292}If ever she doesn't want to go out,|you can ask me. I come and go.
{24292}{24339}We don't need anything.|Thanks anyway.
{24339}{24365}In fact i said: "If it happens..."
{24405}{24422}Have a good day.
{24641}{24736}...Well, i understand that, because--
{24745}{24862}When you are in front of him,|you feel a little uneasy.
{24893}{24927}Then you become his friend.
{24975}{25047}Are we friends? No...
{25053}{25191}But I can say he is normal,|he makes jokes, has fun...
{25203}{25278}He doesn't spend all his time|writing poetry.
{25304}{25358}The book came from Naples.
{25425}{25454}And remember, Mario...
{25454}{25523}you mustn't bother him|with a lot of questions.
{25547}{25658}It's forbidden to annoy customers|with strange requests.
{25669}{25739}I know, I know|I won't annoy him.
{25739}{25854}I'll only ask him to sign this book,|that's all.
{25856}{25930}So when I get paid,|I'll go to Naples...
{25936}{25993}and show all the girls...
{25993}{26126}that I'm a friend of Neruda,|the poet of love!
{26126}{26164}The poet of the people!
{26164}{26182}...of the people...
{26187}{26264}All right, but you have to find|the right moment, be polite,
{26264}{26331}Because if he is thinking of a poem...|a political one maybe,
{26341}{26405}And you bother him,
{26406}{26466}He forgets the poem|and it's a worldwide disaster.
{26478}{26578}No, no, no... I am not stupid,|I can tell when he is thinking...
{26601}{26694}And I won't go there|and just ask for him to sign it..
{26697}{26777}I am having a look at the poems too,
{26786}{26899}So if he makes questions|or asks me about them,
{26902}{26953}Maybe I can even reply, who knows...
{26972}{26995}...so to speak.
{27266}{27332}Excuse me, could you sign it?
{27462}{27520}Please, could you sign it?
{27767}{27803}Would you make it unique,|maestro?
{27899}{27938}Would you make it unique,|maestro?
{28295}{28379}My name's Mario Ruoppolo.
{28425}{28438}Thank you.
{28445}{28476}- And my mail?
{28482}{28520}- There isn't any.
{28802}{28875}Come on, Mario,|you should be happy.
{28889}{28950}Happy?
{28957}{29056}Giorgio, I told him quite clearly,|Mario Ruoppolo.
{29119}{29158}''Regards, Pablo Neruda.''
{29184}{29222}It means nothing.
{29295}{29399}You don't think he can cross|it out and write it better...
{29399}{29456}so you can see it's for me,|that we're friends?
{29523}{29619}Do you think he'd cross it out|because you don't like it...
{29619}{29655}and write you another?
{29719}{29826}Perhaps he did it on purpose|because you bothered him.
{29859}{29925}No, I asked him.|He was staring at the mountain.
{29943}{30031}- Exactly, you see?|- No, I know the mountain...
{30038}{30067}but he was holding an onion.
{30078}{30177}So you think a poet can't think|when he's holding an onion, eh?
{30217}{30287}When am I supposed|to ask him then...
{30288}{30395}if I can't ask him|when he's peeling an onion?
{30407}{30511}Mario, but he's a busy man.|He can't be running after people|to make them happy.
{30567}{30598}Yes, but he's a communist.
{30629}{30668}So what?
{30686}{30796}Didn't you say that|communists love the people?
{30815}{30871}Mario, don't make me annoyed!
{30907}{30922}So...
{30955}{31025}I bought a copy of the book.
{31058}{31112}When you have the chance...
{31112}{31159}with extreme tact...
{31171}{31232}ask him if he would sign it for me.
{31266}{31286}Sign it?
{31306}{31390}Take this one then.|''Regards, Pablo Neruda.''
{31390}{31449}No, this is yours.|He signed it for you.
{31459}{31500}- I'm happy to let you have it.|- No!
{31520}{31559}I want you to tell him this:
{31593}{31688}"Chief Telegraphist|Comrade Giorgio Serafini
{31704}{31769}Kindly asks if you can,
{31778}{31836}kindly, sign it".
{31860}{31957}But i have to wait for the right moment,|when he isn't thinking,
{31957}{31986}when he isn't peeling an onion...
{31999}{32055}I can wait, but it may take months...
{32082}{32155}I don't know when it will be possible.
{32155}{32215}- Would you like mine?|- I said i don't!
{32221}{32252}Then wait...
{33622}{33672}Mr. Di Cosimo, shall|I empty all the water?
{33686}{33720}- All of it, all of it.|- All right.
{33897}{33914}'Morning.
{33914}{33935}Good morning.
{33991}{34015}Mr. Di Cosimo...
{34025}{34124}what can I do to thank you?|Your wreath was the nicest.
{34126}{34204}Nothing, Donna Rosa.|Just vote and get others to vote.
{34222}{34301}Remember to use|that little pencil of yours
{34301}{34380}And hopefully some|of your customers will, too.
{34560}{34642}...happens that I go into the|tailors' shops and the movies...
{34642}{34689}...all shriveled up...
{34710}{34772}impenetrable, like a felt swan...
{34787}{34867}navigating on a water|of origin and ash.
{34912}{34998}The smell of barber shops|makes me sob out loud...
{35061}{35121}I am tired of being a man...''
{35596}{35634}Mail.
{35839}{35852}Thank you.
{36193}{36223}What's the matter?
{36290}{36316}Don Pablo?
{36342}{36404}You're standing|as stiff as a post!
{36451}{36497}Nailed like a spear?
{36526}{36598}No, immobile like the castle|on a chess board.
{36621}{36680}Stiller than a porcelain cat.
{36712}{36772}Elementary Odes isn't|the only book I've written.
{36772}{36805}I've written much better.
{36832}{36918}It's unfair of you to shower me|with similes and metaphors.
{36959}{36980}Don Pablo?
{37000}{37035}Metaphors.
{37072}{37136}What are those?
{37162}{37194}Metaphors?
{37268}{37328}Metaphors are--|How can I explain?
{37328}{37400}When you talk of something,|comparing it to another.
{37423}{37460}Is it something...
{37474}{37518}you use in poetry?
{37539}{37589}Yes, that too.
{37643}{37667}For example?
{37699}{37727}For example...
{37745}{37814}when you say, ''the sky weeps,''|what do you mean?
{37849}{37910}That it's raining.
{37929}{37960}Yes, very good.
{37968}{38074}- That's a metaphor.|- It's easy then!
{38083}{38153}Why has it got such|a complicated name?
{38170}{38282}Man has no business with|the simplicity or complexity of things.
{38407}{38508}Excuse me, Don Pablo,|then I'll go.
{38508}{38564}I was reading something|yesterday:
{38632}{38738}''The smell of barber shops|makes me sob out loud.''
{38749}{38825}Is that a metaphor, too?
{38825}{38851}No...
{38856}{38893}not exactly.
{38939}{39005}I liked it, too, when...
{39005}{39047}when you wrote:
{39070}{39124}''I am tired of being a man.''
{39136}{39222}That's happened to me, too...
{39222}{39274}but I never knew how to say it.
{39284}{39353}I really liked it when I read it.
{39381}{39501}Why ''the smell of|barber shops makes me sob''?
{39561}{39594}You see, Mario...
{39627}{39709}I can't tell you...|in words different from those I've used.
{39757}{39807}When you explain it,|poetry becomes banal.
{39845}{39884}Better than any explanation...
{39895}{39980}is the experience of feelings|that poetry can reveal...
{39994}{40064}to a nature open enough|to understand it.
{41322}{41372}Will you open this, please?
{41416}{41460}- Who, me?|- Yes.
{41527}{41577}- Shall I open it?|- Yes!
{41584}{41625}My hands are dirty.
{41870}{41970}It's written in...|...It's foreign.
{42009}{42067}Is it more important|than the others?
{42082}{42126}Yes, it's from Sweden.
{42169}{42214}What's so special about Sweden?
{42214}{42259}The Nobel Prize for Literature.
{42314}{42338}A prize then?
{42349}{42395}If they give it to me,|I won't refuse.
{42446}{42469}Why?
{42505}{42547}How much money is it?
{42564}{42659}171,135 Swedish krona.
{42681}{42739}I've no idea, is that a lot?
{42793}{42833}Lots and lots!
{42848}{42891}Then you'll get it.
{42903}{42996}There are candidates with|a better chance than me this year.
{43012}{43037}Why?
{43073}{43169}Because they've|written important works.
{43183}{43264}No...|you'll get it, I'm sure.
{43276}{43294}Thank you.
{43302}{43363}Shall I open the other letters?
{43363}{43426}No, I'll read them later.
{43455}{43493}Are they love letters?
{43500}{43593}What a question!|Don't let Matilde hear you.
{43593}{43674}I'm sorry, Don Pablo.|I only meant--
{43791}{43858}I'd like to be a poet, too.
{43941}{44016}No, it's more original|being a postman.
{44029}{44090}You get to walk a lot|and don't get fat.
{44099}{44159}We poets are all fat.
{44196}{44212}Yes, but...
{44219}{44262}with poetry...
{44280}{44330}I could make women fall for me.
{44372}{44393}How--
{44449}{44486}How do you become a poet?
{44596}{44696}Try and walk slowly along|the shore as far as the bay...
{44730}{44778}and look around you.
{44793}{44849}And will they come to me,|these metaphors?
{44886}{44922}Certainly.
{44950}{45051}Oh, I'd love that, it would be nice...
{45078}{45130}I could say anything i want...
{45130}{45200}But even if you aren't a poet|you can say anything you want...
{45235}{45284}Yes, but not as well as--
{45291}{45362}It's much better for you to say|something you are convinced of,|in a bad way
{45362}{45452}than be a poet and say well|what others want you to say.
{45536}{45565}Don Pablo?
{45608}{45655}We'll discuss this another time.
{45780}{45822}Another time...
{45837}{45885}Oh, I didn't mean now...
{45898}{45941}See you Don Pablo.
{47602}{47628}Don Pablo?
{47876}{47993}Mario, can you send someone to see|about this problem of water?
{47993}{48043}Have you got water?
{48060}{48125}No, that's exactly the problem.
{48172}{48209}That's no problem at all!
{48217}{48270}Why? Is it normal?
{48270}{48291}It's normal.
{48305}{48356}You've run out of water...
{48356}{48402}up at the cistern.
{48434}{48473}Do you use a lot of water?
{48485}{48567}No, just what I need.
{48593}{48643}Then that's too much.
{48652}{48716}Because...
{48728}{48830}it runs out all of a sudden|because the water-supply ship...
{48830}{48958}comes only once a month,|so the water gets used up.
{48958}{49051}We've got-- They've been saying|we'll get running water...
{49069}{49124}for ages.
{49124}{49168}''You'll have running water.'' But--
{49175}{49212}And you don't protest?
{49231}{49295}What do we say?
{49307}{49404}My father swears every so often...
{49425}{49452}but... only to himself.
{49460}{49563}Mario, There are people who,|with a strong will, |manage to change things.
{49570}{49593}It's a pity.
{49627}{49667}This place is so beautiful!
{49752}{49774}Think so?
{49833}{49890}Yes. Sit down.
{49990}{50058}Here on the island, the sea...
{50065}{50100}so much sea.
{50111}{50145}It spills over from time to time.
{50152}{50217}It says yes, then no...
{50234}{50258}then no.
{50264}{50326}In blue, in foam, in a gallop...
{50326}{50367}it says no, then no.
{50394}{50470}It cannot be still.|My name is sea, it repeats...
{50470}{50560}striking a stone|but not convincing it.
{50560}{50650}Then with the seven green tongues|of seven green tigers...
{50652}{50711}of seven green dogs|of seven green seas...
{50717}{50785}it caresses it, kisses it, wets it...
{50786}{50870}and pounds on its chest,|repeating its own name.
{50918}{50952}Well?
{50959}{50992}What do you think?
{51041}{51062}It's weird.
{51089}{51117}What do you mean, weird?
{51140}{51235}- You're a severe critic.|- No, not your poem.
{51242}{51270}Weird...
{51296}{51325}Weird...
{51368}{51430}how I felt while|you were saying it.
{51451}{51482}How was that?
{51520}{51537}I don't know.
{51595}{51651}The words went back and forth.
{51665}{51732}- Like the sea then?|- Exactly.
{51732}{51812}- Like the sea.|- There, that's the rhythm.
{51822}{51903}- I feIt seasick, in fact.|- Seasick...
{51927}{51956}Because...
{51981}{52037}I can't explain it. I felt like...
{52053}{52153}like a boat tossing|around on those words.
{52200}{52278}Like a boat tossing|around on my words?
{52347}{52399}Do you know what you've done, Mario?
{52425}{52521}- No, what?|- You've invented a metaphor.
{52555}{52679}- Yes, you have!|- Really?
{52774}{52864}But it doesn't count|because I didn't mean to.
{52864}{52902}Meaning to is not important.
{52902}{52972}Images arise spontaneously.
{53048}{53115}You mean then that...
{53140}{53199}for example,|I don't know if you follow me...
{53205}{53234}that the whole worId...
{53262}{53356}the whole world,|with the sea, the sky...
{53373}{53418}with the rain, the clouds--
{53418}{53475}Now you can say etc. etc.
{53475}{53524}Etc. etc.
{53542}{53626}The whole world is|the metaphor for something else?
{53671}{53728}- I'm talking crap.|- No, not at all.
{53728}{53776}Not at all.
{53785}{53824}You pulled a strange face.
{53870}{53897}Mario, let's make a pact.
{53924}{53955}I'll have a nice swim...
{53983}{54039}and ponder your question.
{54040}{54109}Then I'll give you|an answer tomorrow.
{54116}{54202}- Really?|- Yes, really.
{57612}{57642}Don Pablo, good morning.
{57663}{57712}I've got to talk to you.
{57714}{57788}It must be very important.|You're snorting like a horse.
{57807}{57864}It's very important.
{57893}{57984}- I've fallen in love.|- Nothing serious. There's a remedy.
{57984}{58135}No, no remedy! I don't want a remedy.|I want to stay sick.
{58135}{58218}I'm in love,|really, really in love.
{58218}{58278}Who are you in love with?
{58278}{58342}Her name's Beatrice.
{58367}{58428}Oh, Dante.
{58475}{58510}Don Pablo?
{58520}{58555}Dante Alighieri.
{58567}{58624}He fell for a certain Beatrice.
{58640}{58732}Beatrices have|inspired boundless love, Mario
{58867}{58896}What are you doing?
{58896}{58976}Writing down the name Dante.
{58981}{59031}Dante I know, but Alighieri--
{59042}{59132}- Has it got an ''h'' in it?|- Wait, I'll write it for you.
{59132}{59162}Thank you.
{59428}{59476}I'm madly in love.
{59476}{59565}You've already told me that,|but what can I do about it?
{59589}{59667}I don't know, if you can help--
{59669}{59704}But I'm an old man.
{59742}{59784}I don't know, because...
{59784}{59883}I suddenly saw her in front of me.
{59888}{59951}I stared at her,|but I couldn't utter a word.
{59957}{60005}What, you didn't|say anything to her?
{60053}{60112}Not much.
{60112}{60217}- I watched her and fell in love.|- Just like that? In a flash?
{60232}{60346}No, I stared at her|for ten minutes first.
{60365}{60379}And she?
{60381}{60446}And she said...
{60536}{60567}What's up,|never seen a woman before?
{60859}{60898}What's your name?
{60990}{61030}Beatrice Russo.
{61213}{61237}And you?
{61279}{61320}I couldn't think of anything to say.
{61351}{61409}Nothing at all?
{61409}{61516}- You didn't say a word?|- Not exactly nothing.
{61522}{61561}I said five words to her.
{61577}{61592}Which were?
{61614}{61654}I said, ''What's your name?''
{61713}{61773}- And she?|- And she: ''Beatrice Russo.''
{61838}{61922}''What's your name?'' are three words.|And the other two?
{61943}{62006}Then I repeated Beatrice Russo.
{62068}{62102}Don PabIo, if--
{62149}{62228}I don't want to bother you, but...
{62234}{62292}can you write me|a poem for Beatrice?
{62790}{62833}I don't even know her!
{62882}{62973}A poet needs to know|the object of his inspiration!
{63043}{63110}I can't invent something|out of nothing.
{63120}{63162}I've got this little ball...
{63162}{63254}which Beatrice put in her mouth.|She's touched it.
{63263}{63283}So what?
{63295}{63369}It might help you.
{63442}{63477}Look, Poet...
{63477}{63560}if you make all this fuss|over one poem...
{63560}{63621}you're never going|to win that Nobel Prize!
{63659}{63741}Mario, pinch me and wake me|from this nightmare!
{63805}{63865}What am I supposed to do?
{63865}{63955}No one else can help me.|They're all fishermen here!
{63959}{63989}What am I supposed to do?
{63989}{64086}Fishermen fall in love, too!
{64105}{64175}They are able to talk|to the girls they love...
{64195}{64243}to make them fall in love, too,|and marry them.
{64298}{64360}- What does your father do?|- He's a fisherman.
{64360}{64388}Naturally!
{64388}{64499}He must have spoken to your mother|to get her to marry him.
{64526}{64618}I don't think so.|He doesn't talk much.
{64741}{64780}Come on, give me my mail.
{64997}{65036}Thank you, but I don't want it.
{66542}{66620}- Do you want something else?|- No, thanks.
{66727}{66817}Beatrice, your smile|spreads like a butterfly.
{66895}{66960}Fallen out of bed this morning?
{66982}{67048}I came earlier because...
{67089}{67143}I saw this.|It looks important.
{67171}{67239}You're right, it is important.
{67311}{67334}And then...
{67369}{67415}there's something else...
{67433}{67526}I've been meaning to give you|but kept forgetting.
{67586}{67671}- I'll put it here. Good-bye.|- Wait a minute.
{67724}{67766}I've got something for you, too.
{67851}{67874}Here.
{68077}{68137}It might be useful|for your metaphors.
{68520}{68537}Is it a radio?
{68568}{68684}No, but it's a kind of radio.
{68698}{68752}You speak into here...
{68764}{68809}and this repeats what you say.
{68837}{68946}You speak into it|and it repeats what you say?
{68952}{68969}Yes.
{68983}{69044}- How many times?|- As many times as you want.
{69058}{69099}But you mustn't exaggerate.
{69112}{69233}Even the most sublime idea|seems foolish if heard too often.
{69335}{69376}Listen.
{70898}{70939}Good news?
{71105}{71162}When I was Senator|of the Republic...
{71178}{71235}I went to visit Pampa...
{71244}{71329}a region where it only rains|once every 50 years...
{71337}{71427}where life|is unimaginably hard.
{71477}{71545}I wanted to meet the people|who had voted for me.
{71584}{71610}One day...
{71651}{71754}at Lota, there was a man|who had come up from a coal mine.
{71761}{71826}He was a mask|of coal dust and sweat...
{71893}{71916}his face...
{71954}{72022}contorted by terrible hardship...
{72030}{72092}his eyes red from the dust.
{72159}{72225}He stretched out|his calloused hand and said:
{72267}{72302}''Wherever you go...
{72329}{72373}speak of this torment.
{72445}{72553}Speak of your brother|who lives underground...
{72566}{72597}in hell.''
{72654}{72795}I felt I had to write something|to help man in his struggle...
{72830}{72910}to write the poetry|of the mistreated.
{72940}{72994}That's how ''Canto General''|came about.
{73034}{73069}Now my comrades...
{73099}{73193}tell me they have managed to|get it published secretly in Chile...
{73195}{73229}and it's selling like hot cakes.
{73272}{73302}That makes me very happy.
{74037}{74116}I told them I'm here with|a friend who wishes to say hello.
{74121}{74219}And tell them something nice|about this beautiful country| which is hosting me.
{74249}{74269}Yes.
{74313}{74368}- Good morning.|- No, in there.
{74403}{74427}Good morning...
{74489}{74540}Something nice about the island?
{74542}{74609}Yes, one of the wonders|of your island.
{74649}{74722}Beatrice Russo.
{74763}{74813}- Yes, very well|- Well.
{74881}{74935}Now let's go to the inn...
{74964}{75036}and meet this famous|Beatrice Russo.
{75062}{75098}Are you joking?
{75098}{75147}No, I'm serious.
{75166}{75219}Let's have a look at this girlfriend.
{75237}{75273}Oh boy!
{75273}{75377}Pablo Neruda and Mario Ruoppolo|at the inn. She'll faint!
{75466}{75538}Well? What is it now?
{75591}{75703}Don Pablo, when I get married|to Beatrice Russo...
{75703}{75746}will you be my best man?
{75814}{75838}Listen...
{75842}{75936}first let's have a drink,|then we'll decide.
{76261}{76311}Gennarino, wait! I'm coming, too!
{76509}{76615}Domenico, come here|or I'll thrash you!
{76683}{76739}Look who's here. Neruda!
{76790}{76835}- Good morning.|- Good morning.
{77172}{77196}What will it be?
{77251}{77295}A glass of red wine, please.
{77302}{77353}And the pinball king?
{77414}{77483}- Do you want red wine, too?|- Red wine, yes.
{77483}{77562}Two glasses of red wine|and a pen to write with.
{77617}{77660}He's here for your niece.
{77822}{77848}Give me the notebook.
{77860}{77908}Notebook? Why?
{78016}{78029}Thank you
{78191}{78205}Thank you
{78290}{78310}Just a moment.
{78762}{78890}''To Mario, my intimate friend|and comrade - Pablo Neruda''
{78952}{78974}There you are.
{79049}{79095}You already have your poetry.
{79130}{79237}If you want to write it down,|here's your notebook.
{79287}{79307}Thank you.
{79937}{79962}Beatrice?
{79990}{80008}What is it?
{80375}{80418}Go home. It's closing time!
{80445}{80561}I won't make you pay for the bottle,|but go home. We're closing.
{80619}{80717}- Hey, what are you doing?|- I'm thinking.
{80731}{80755}With the window open?
{80787}{80820}Yes, with the window open.
{80847}{80918}Be honest with me.|What did he tell you?
{80978}{81008}Metaphors.
{81025}{81052}Metaphors?
{81052}{81127}Never heard such big words|from you before.
{81153}{81194}What metaphors did he do to you?
{81229}{81282}Did? He said them!
{81306}{81429}He said my smile spreads|across my face like a butterfly.
{81444}{81531}- And then?|- I laughed when he said that.
{81599}{81663}Your laugh is a rose...
{81675}{81740}a spear unearthed, crashing water.
{81763}{81839}Your laugh is|a sudden silvery wave.
{81868}{81916}Then what did you do?
{81950}{81988}I kept quiet.
{82027}{82041}And he?
{82075}{82169}- What else did he say?|- No, what did he do?
{82169}{82272}Your postman, as well as a mouth,|has two hands!
{82272}{82305}He never touched me.
{82319}{82411}He said he was happy|to be next to a pure young woman.
{82453}{82515}Like being on the shores|of the white ocean.
{82542}{82561}I like it--
{82595}{82624}I like it when you're silent...
{82662}{82699}because it's as though|you're absent.
{82766}{82793}And you?
{82831}{82856}And he?
{82890}{82988}He looked at me, too,|then he stopped looking at my eyes...
{83005}{83058}and began to look at my hair...
{83069}{83146}without a word,|as though he were thinking.
{83151}{83196}Enough, my child!
{83196}{83270}When a man starts|to touch you with words...
{83270}{83320}he's not far off with his hands.
{83375}{83423}There's nothing wrong with words.
{83444}{83542}Words are the worst things ever.
{83542}{83662}I'd prefer a drunkard|at the bar touching your bum...
{83662}{83768}to someone who says,|''Your smile flies like a butterfly''!
{83768}{83820}It ''spreads'' like a butterfly!
{83832}{83906}Flies, spreads,|it's the same thing!
{83921}{83975}Just look at you!
{83984}{84067}One stroke of his finger,|and you're on your back.
{84085}{84133}You're wrong.|He's a decent person.
{84154}{84218}When it comes to bed,|there's no difference...
{84218}{84327}between a poet, a priest|or even a communist!
{84377}{84394}''Naked...
{84424}{84474}you are as simple|as one of your hands...
{84498}{84548}smooth, terrestrial, tiny...
{84565}{84601}round, transparent.
{84616}{84687}You have moon-lines, apple paths.
{84714}{84780}Naked, you are as thin|as bare wheat.
{84817}{84871}Naked, you are blue|like a Cuban night.
{84883}{84941}There are vines and stars|in your hair.
{84978}{85078}Naked, you are enormous and yellow...|like summer in a gilded church.''
{85462}{85497}Good morning, Father.
{85532}{85597}I found this in her brassiere.
{85609}{85682}I want you to read it to me.
{85700}{85714}Come on!
{85719}{85814}I'm not letting her|out of the house for now.
{85892}{85917}Well?
{85960}{85989}It's a poem.
{86068}{86104}Read it to me!
{86145}{86175}''Naked...
{86193}{86221}Madonna!
{86618}{86704}What are the nets like?|Mario, I need an adjective.
{86754}{86825}Nets-- Which nets?|Fishing nets?
{86830}{86846}Yes.
{86876}{86893}Sad.
{86938}{86962}Sad.
{87169}{87190}All right?
{89587}{89610}There is a lady,
{89610}{89677}I think she is the owner|of the inn, Donna Rosa.
{89761}{89807}- Good morning, signora.|- Good morning.
{89822}{89853}- Would you like--|- Yes.
{89952}{90009}Please, sit down.
{90009}{90131}No. What I want to say is|too serious to say sitting down.
{90154}{90178}What is it about?
{90190}{90246}For over a month...
{90246}{90340}Mario Ruoppolo has been|hanging around my inn...
{90340}{90426}and he has seduced my niece.
{90502}{90565}- What did he tell her?|- Metaphors.
{90620}{90646}Well?
{90664}{90785}Well?...He's heated her up|like an oven with his metaphors!
{90795}{90934}A man whose only capital|is the fungus between his toes!
{90952}{91083}But if his feet are full of germs,|his mouth is full of spells.
{91129}{91256}It started off innocently enough:|''Her smile was like a butterfly.''
{91256}{91377}But now he's saying her breast|is like a fire with two flames.
{91444}{91501}But do you think...
{91514}{91609}that these images are only|his imagination or that--
{91619}{91715}Yes, I think he's had|his hands on her.
{91730}{91816}Read this.|It was in her brassiere.
{92084}{92112}''Naked--
{92145}{92171}As beautiful as--
{92190}{92312}Naked, you're as delicate|as nights on the island...
{92367}{92444}and stars in your hair--''
{92498}{92518}It's beautiful!
{92527}{92607}So he's seen my niece naked!
{92614}{92656}No, signora Rosa!
{92659}{92748}Nothing in this poem|leads us to think that.
{92761}{92829}The poem's telling the truth.
{92839}{92935}My niece naked is just|as the poem describes her.
{92946}{93051}So do me a favor|and tell Mario Ruoppolo...
{93051}{93106}who's learnt a lot from you...
{93106}{93235}that he must never see my niece|again for the rest of his life.
{93278}{93421}And tell him that if he does,|I'll shoot him.
{93421}{93462}- Is that clear?|- Yes.
{93471}{93485}Good day.
{93935}{93978}You're as white as a sack of flour.
{94006}{94107}I might be white outside,|but inside I'm red.
{94227}{94316}You won't save yourself|from the widow's fury with adjectives.
{94363}{94423}If she harms me, she'll go to jail.
{94471}{94509}She'll be out in a couple of hours.
{94555}{94621}She'll say she acted|out of self-defense.
{94653}{94747}She'll say you threatened|the virginity of her damsel:
{94779}{94853}with a metaphor|hissing like a dagger...
{94853}{94934}as sharp as a canine,|as lacerating as a hymen.
{94946}{95076}The poetry will have left|the mark of its seditious saliva|on the virgin's nipples.
{95091}{95161}The poet Francois Villon|was hung from a tree for much less...
{95177}{95256}and his blood gushed|from his neck like roses.
{95259}{95349}I don't care. She can do|what she wants. I'm ready.
{95378}{95478}Good lad! It's a real shame|we haven't got...
{95493}{95583}a trio of guitarists to go...|cuccuruccuccu...
{95630}{95687}My dear poet and comrade...
{95687}{95783}you got me into this mess,|you've got to get me out of it.
{95801}{95839}You gave me books to read...
{95839}{95947}you taught me to use my tongue|for more than licking stamps.
{95947}{96015}It's your fault if I'm in love.
{96019}{96082}No, this has nothing to do with me.
{96088}{96126}I gave you my books...
{96145}{96198}but I didn't authorize you|to steal my poems.
{96233}{96320}If I think you gave Beatrice|the poem I wrote for Matlide--
{96359}{96483}Poetry doesn't belong to those|who write it, but those who need it.
{96504}{96609}I appreciate that highly|democratic sentiment.
{96734}{96791}Now go home and get some sleep.
{96820}{96928}You've bags under your eyes|as large and deep as soup bowls.
{97029}{97047}Mario...
{97067}{97160}as your superior I must order you|to deliver the undelivered mail.
{97165}{97191}Yes, yes, yes.
{97253}{97324}But you're still|moping after that girl.
{97352}{97396}Beatrice is pretty now...
{97396}{97451}but in 50 years|she'll be as ugly as the rest.
{97451}{97523}No, Beatrice will never be ugly.
{97531}{97633}Heh... Secretly, within me
{97633}{97735}I held the splendor of your eyes...
{97744}{97781}blissful Beatrice.
{97832}{97872}What's Beatrice got to do with it?
{97883}{97911}It's a poem.
{97929}{97975}Oh, Dante Alighieri--
{97978}{98048}No, Gabriele D'Annunzio, my poet.
{98096}{98167}Your poet wrote something|for Beatrice?
{98222}{98256}I don't like it.
{98261}{98280}Here you are.
{98301}{98403}Strange, I thought you'd|appreciate a hymn to Beatrice.
{98449}{98479}Thank you. Good-bye.
{98977}{99052}- Hey, Sleeping Beauty...|- Good evening.
{99056}{99160}Good evening. Give the Marshal|his usual, and pour one for me, too.
{99340}{99358}Thank you.
{99409}{99474}Your niece gets|more and more beautiful.
{99480}{99596}If you only knew how difficult|it is to keep a hold on her.
{99605}{99680}Young people today aren't|what they used to be, Donna Rosa
{99685}{99731}They have everything|and want the moon.
{99738}{99837}I remember my poor departed mother.|I'd tremble whenever she spoke.
{99839}{99858}- True...|- Yes
{99926}{99973}Good night, Aunt.|Good night, Marshal.
{99983}{100025}Good night, beauty, goodnight.
{100101}{100143}She is really sweet.
{103337}{103427}Find yourselves a decent person|who isn't a communist.
{103444}{103526}If Neruda doesn't believe in God,|why should God believe in Neruda?
{103532}{103568}What sort of witness would he be?
{103663}{103770}God never said a communist|can't be a witness at a wedding.
{103841}{103896}I'm not getting married then.
{103906}{104005}You're more interested in Neruda|as a witness than me as your wife.
{104017}{104061}My darling...
{104061}{104128}Neruda's a Catholic.
{104136}{104192}I know he's a Catholic.
{104232}{104354}In Russia, communists eat babies.|How can he be Catholic?
{104369}{104416}He doesn't look the type.
{104416}{104495}Yes, but Neruda has a pretty wife.
{104495}{104597}He's getting old and he has no children.|How do you explain that?
{104683}{104795}So according to you,|Don Pablo ate his kids?
{104801}{104821}Who knows?
{104834}{104895}- Come on...|- Anyway, my answer is no,
{104914}{104943}for your sake, too.
{104956}{105058}He inspired your bridegroom|to write that filthy stuff...
{105071}{105086}...Naked--
{105111}{105147}That was only a poem.
{105174}{105217}Not to mention the rest.
{105231}{105307}He's not worthy of being witness|to your happiness.
{106303}{106336}She'd say:
{106351}{106466}''I ask Jesus to let me live|to see my son with a job...
{106476}{106543}a wife and chlidren in his arms.''
{106550}{106592}Unfortunately, she didn't make it...
{106610}{106660}because when the Lord|called her to Him...
{106680}{106719}he didn't even have a job.
{106739}{106861}Today, from heaven my poor wife|will see that he's made her happy...
{106861}{106977}because at least he's got|a wife and a little job.
{106981}{107074}Even if it's not the job|she'd have wanted for him--
{107074}{107139}All the best!|Well done, Dad!
{107166}{107185}Cheers!
{107431}{107464}What are you doing, drinking wine?
{107567}{107663}I'm sorry, Comrade, I forgot.|This came for you.
{107702}{107728}Thank you.
{107880}{107903}Can we leave?
{107938}{108012}Yes we only need a week|for the authorization.
{108019}{108099}Oh, I am so happy|I can't believe it...
{108131}{108199}- Good news?|- To the newly weds!
{108514}{108548}With a chaste heart...
{108577}{108599}with pure eyes...
{108626}{108669}I celebrate your beauty...
{108691}{108780}holding the leash of blood|so that it might leap out|and trace the line,
{108798}{108827}Your outline
{108849}{108960}so you can lie down in my ode|as in a land of forests, or in a surf:
{108980}{109074}in aromatic loam or in sea music.
{109186}{109211}Now...
{109241}{109324}I'd like to toast my friend...
{109326}{109349}Mario...
{109381}{109499}and say what a pleasure it was for me|to participate, in a small way...
{109499}{109531}to his happiness.
{109550}{109569}Cheers!
{109658}{109770}And lastly, I'd like to say|that on this very special day...
{109798}{109878}I have received|some wonderful news.
{109910}{109965}The warrant for our arrest...
{109979}{110004}has been revoked...
{110033}{110116}and therefore|Matilde and I can now...
{110191}{110250}return to the country|we love so much:
{110293}{110311}Chile.
{112847}{112888}No, Don Pablo.
{112932}{112990}But you'll be unemployed tomorrow.
{112990}{113067}No, I don't want anything.
{113217}{113247}I'll miss you, Mario.
{113295}{113332}I'll miss you.
{113390}{113430}But you will write to me?
{113491}{113508}Of course.
{113622}{113702}Things change|all the time in my country.
{113750}{113795}Today they'll let me go back.
{113837}{113935}Tomorrow something else will happen|and I'll have to flee again.
{114024}{114073}I'll leave some things|here anyway...
{114105}{114188}if you could keep|an eye on them for me.
{114214}{114261}I'll let you know where to send them.
{114274}{114347}Perhaps I'll bring them|to Chile myself.
{114472}{114509}That'd be wonderful.
{114608}{114660}Do you need to take this with you?
{114687}{114707}Yes.
{114772}{114786}Thank you.
{114801}{114910}I've discovered another poet|who wrote about Beatrice...
{114925}{114952}called D'Annunzio.
{114972}{115020}- Did you know that?|- Yes.
{115041}{115109}So you could have written one, too.
{115338}{115390}- Good-bye, Mario.|- Good-bye.
{117423}{117490}..What Mr. Di Cosimo started|on this island
{117496}{117560}is a sign of civility and modernity
{117567}{117658}Enough with the water-supply ships|which come and go
{117661}{117701}from the dry land to the island
{117706}{117744}Our candidate,
{117744}{117836}will lead all of us|on a new path.
{117845}{117874}Vote for Di Cosimo...
{118106}{118148}This is for you.|Vote for Di Cosimo.
{118158}{118280}They promised us running water|on the island two years ago, too.
{118286}{118373}Two years ago, it wasn't|Di Cosimo who promised you.
{118373}{118464}What's written on that paper|is a pledge, not a promise.
{118464}{118529}An oath, and God is my witness.
{118643}{118660}Hey, Mario!
{118686}{118745}Aren't you interested|in what I'm saying?
{118783}{118843}I'm voting communist.
{118857}{118871}What?
{118933}{118969}I'm voting communist.
{119017}{119086}I hear you've|gone crazy about poetry.
{119110}{119176}I hear you're competing|with Pablo Neruda.
{119206}{119326}But remember, poets can do|a lot of damage to people.
{119407}{119494}- How much do these clams cost?|- 300 lire to you.
{119496}{119596}For that price you'll have to|guarantee me a pearl in each one.
{119597}{119681}- Give me a good price.|- Ok then I'll give you a discount, all right?
{119684}{119719}- All right then thank you.|- Good.
{119726}{119804}Fishermen are exploited|enough as it is.
{119812}{119893}He said 300 lire.|Why should he give you a discount?
{119925}{119987}I don't mean to exploit anyone.|Good-bye.
{119994}{120031}Why don't you mind|your own business?
{120104}{120182}I was trying to help.
{120579}{120636}- What is it?|- Look at this.
{120650}{120693}He's in Russia, giving an award.
{120767}{120866}In Russia? If he's over here,|he might pay a visit.
{120866}{120950}He's a very busy man, Mario!
{120962}{121041}He must meet the people|he didn't see when he was in exile.
{121056}{121084}And he's also well-loved in Chile.
{121102}{121143}He won't have time to come here.
{121171}{121209}It's a good picture.
{121233}{121334}- The young poet, Milovan--|- Perkovic.
{121344}{121395}Awarded a poetry prize|by the maestro.
{121425}{121480}- Can I keep it?|- No, you can't.
{121491}{121534}I'll put it in here|with all the rest.
{121574}{121629}...but you can look at it|whenever you llke.
{121649}{121675}Vote for Di Cosimo.
{121682}{121808}The candidate promises|to lead us on a new path!
{121816}{121879}Vote for Di Cosimo!|For a new way of life!
{121879}{121926}For the sake of our island!
{122097}{122138}Did that fellow come here?
{122150}{122205}- Who?|- Di Cosimo.
{122205}{122231}Yes.
{122256}{122304}Did he?|Why are you smiling?
{122323}{122422}Di Cosimo has served us|a fortune on a silver platter.
{122447}{122473}Really?
{122488}{122621}20 families will be coming here|to work on the new water mains.
{122621}{122759}Di Cosimo asked us if we can|provide them with two meals a day.
{122759}{122809}And we can't.
{122817}{122894}We told them we could.|They'll be here for two years.
{122911}{123013}- Without asking me?|- Just add it all up.
{123059}{123075}Money.
{123099}{123154}All you can think about is money.
{123154}{123208}Where will we put 20 families?
{123208}{123275}We'll do two or three servings|if necessary!
{123296}{123351}Please yourselves.
{123355}{123430}No, we'll do as we please.
{123430}{123527}Would you be prepared to work|in the kitchen, ''signor'' husband?
{123579}{123617}- In the kitchen?|- Yes.
{123656}{123675}Yes.
{124106}{124126}Tomatoes,
{124152}{124189}red entrails,
{124211}{124246}fresh suns.
{124315}{124341}Artichokes,
{124346}{124386}dressed as warriors,
{124403}{124458}and burnished like pomegranate.
{124502}{124523}Garlic,
{124550}{124600}precious ivory.
{124775}{124868}A toast to Beatrice,|the prettiest girl in town!
{125307}{125379}Alas, we have to kill it...
{125399}{125496}...stab a knife|into its living pulp.
{125874}{125889}Look!
{125968}{126037}- What does it say?|- He's in Paris.
{126097}{126151}''Whereas I really loved Italy...
{126165}{126289}where I led a happy life|in complete solitude...
{126308}{126371}and among the most simple|people in the world.''
{126457}{126525}''What things are you|most nostalgic about?''
{126531}{126642}''Nostalgia is an emotion I can feel|only for my own country...
{126664}{126741}but I will never forget...
{126787}{126877}my strolls along the beach|and among the rocks...
{126892}{126962}where tiny plants and flowers grow...
{126976}{127105}exactly the same way|as in a large garden composition.''
{127163}{127198}Go on.
{127241}{127261}That's it.
{127266}{127344}- Oh, that's it.|- He doesn't even mention us.
{127378}{127458}Why should he mention us|in an interview?
{127458}{127538}He's a poet.|Poets talk about nature...
{127538}{127598}not about the people they meet.
{127611}{127669}The bird that has eaten flies away!
{127680}{127775}I bet he doesn't even remember|what we look like.
{127780}{127819}You dont know what you're saying...
{127983}{128058}The day before|the elections
{128081}{128131}...Upon the polls of June 7th
{128131}{128181}depends the future of our land.
{128181}{128228}For this reason, go to vote tomorrow.
{128250}{128358}Italian towns where trade and industry,|professions and jobs flourish,
{128374}{128458}were democratically given free meetings|during the electoral campaign
{128458}{128488}to point out everyone's opinions.
{128530}{128586}If you have doubts|solve them with your vote.
{128610}{128668}If you have beliefs,|affirm them on your ballot-card.
{128691}{128738}There's only one appointment:|July 7th.
{128743}{128851}The Christian Democrats have been|victorious in every region.
{128879}{128957}The party chairman|has expressed his satisfaction.
{128957}{128995}Satisfaction!
{129021}{129042}They haven't managed it.
{129082}{129158}What? They've taken|every region in Italy.
{129166}{129225}They can't do anything|with a handful of votes!
{129236}{129289}They cannot have the "swindle-Act" pass!
{129310}{129348}They've won a battle,|but not the war.
{129361}{129396}So we'll win the war?
{129422}{129440}Who else?
{129471}{129544}But we have to fight,|and we will fight!
{129561}{129624}It's the only way to break|our chains
{129624}{129654}and set ourselves free!
{129723}{129759}Yes, but here...
{129777}{129830}when we've broken our chains...
{129855}{129888}what do we do then?
{129938}{130010}If Don Pablo could hear you,|he wouldn't approve.
{130010}{130107}Don Pablo.|Don Pablo can't hear me.
{130113}{130206}Who knows where he is,|what he's doing?
{130287}{130329}What's with these long faces?
{130345}{130435}Mr. Di Cosimo,|this is a tragedy for us.
{130435}{130511}We were counting on|those two years of work.
{130520}{130624}We'd made plans,|run up debts even.
{130632}{130681}I know, Donna Rosa..
{130681}{130739}it's a shame to leave|the work half-completed...
{130756}{130813}but we hope to start again soon.
{130820}{130850}Soon? When?
{130881}{130899}I don't know.
{130937}{130969}It depends.
{131013}{131062}But I assure you it won't be long.
{131084}{131162}Anyway, I can't wait|to try out your cooking.
{131228}{131267}What does it depend on?
{131299}{131355}Company problems|are very complicated.
{131355}{131431}I don't know much|about company problems...
{131470}{131511}but I'm not daft.
{131567}{131651}We all knew that|as soon as you got elected...
{131651}{131700}the work would come to a halt.
{131729}{131742}That's true.
{131824}{131877}The husband's hot-blooded.
{131961}{132019}If Don Pablo had been here...
{132038}{132081}maybe the elections|would have gone better.
{132171}{132213}Mario, I have something|to tell you.
{132246}{132273}I'm pregnant.
{132312}{132364}- Really?|- Yes.
{132378}{132434}- You're really pregnant?|- Yes.
{132498}{132534}We have to leave here.
{132566}{132702}No one understands us here.|They're all too ignorant.
{132705}{132804}We'll go to Chile, so Pablito|will grow up there, breathe poetry.
{132827}{132853}Pablito?
{132860}{132905}Yes, Pablito.
{132920}{132960}Don't you like it?
{132976}{133035}After Neruda. It'll be|a good omen for our son.
{133609}{133652}- Mario?|- No. He's in front.
{133652}{133695}Oh, he's in front...
{133769}{133843}Mario, is that you?|There's a letter from Chile.
{133843}{133900}Put it in my pocket, please.
{135300}{135396}- Open it!|- Wait..- "Mario Ruoppolo".
{135420}{135466}It's the first|letter I've ever received.
{136015}{136105}''Santiago, 15th October, 1953.
{136172}{136204}Dear Sir...
{136251}{136309}I ask you to send me...
{136329}{136408}some objects belonging to...
{136439}{136491}signor Pablo Neruda...
{136520}{136619}which are to be found|in the house where he lived...
{136619}{136661}during his...
{136683}{136752}stay in Italy.
{136793}{136826}Address enclosed...
{136848}{136885}and a list of...
{136922}{136973}the above-mentioned objects.
{137010}{137125}The secretary... the secretary...|of Pablo Neruda.''
{137451}{137473}And for you?
{137491}{137626}Not a word, not a greeting,|and he left over a year ago.
{137640}{137719}I told you, the bird|that has eaten flies away!
{137719}{137820}People are kind only|when you're useful to them.
{137843}{137908}Not again with that|''bird that has eaten.''
{137908}{138058}And useful for what?|What did I do for this person?
{138058}{138105}In fact, it was always me...
{138138}{138231}who would ask, ''Don Pablo,|will you check this metaphor?''
{138231}{138290}''Don Pablo,|will you read me a poem?''
{138290}{138414}I'm the one who bothered him.|And you say I was useful.
{138414}{138524}What did I do?
{138549}{138667}And yet he knew|I was no good as a poet.
{138676}{138733}He knew, you know?
{138733}{138787}But instead he treated me|like a friend...
{138797}{138887}...all the time.|He treated me like a brother.
{138920}{138971}It's not true that you're no good.
{139013}{139080}And I'm not calling him Pablito.
{139106}{139166}What has the baby|got to do with it?
{139197}{139252}Why, do you think I'm a poet?
{139282}{139373}Am I a poet? Have I ever|written anything, any poems?
{139373}{139412}No, Mario, but--
{139412}{139553}Then ''No, Mario'' nothing,|admit it.
{139644}{139713}Why should he remember me?
{139727}{139840}As a poet, I'm not much good.
{139860}{139931}As a postman--|He would hardly remember...
{139933}{140052}a postman who took him|his mail when he lived in Italy.
{140052}{140078}As a communist?
{140099}{140155}Not even that. I wasn't very--
{140246}{140296}I think it's...
{140325}{140385}quite normal that he--
{140513}{140554}Well, all right.
{140559}{140662}Tomorrow, we'll go there|and send his things off.
{145093}{145160}I told them I'm here with|a friend who wishes to say hello...
{145169}{145275}and tell them something nice|about this beautiful country|which is hosting me.
{145294}{145342}- No.|- Yes.
{145360}{145381}Good morning.
{145404}{145425}No, there.
{145454}{145476}Good morning.
{145537}{145590}Something nice about the island?
{145599}{145660}Yes, one of the wonders|of your island.
{145691}{145749}Beatrice Russo
{145774}{145863}- Yes, very well.|- Well.
{146476}{146530}Are you sure|it works outdoors, too?
{146534}{146610}If it works inside,|it'll work outside.
{146685}{146716}- It works here.|- Yes.
{146823}{146894}One, two, three.|Is the red light on?
{146906}{146930}Yes, it's lit.
{147369}{147479}One.|Number one.
{147498}{147571}Waves at the Cala di Sotto.
{147587}{147619}Small ones.
{147636}{147661}Go on!
{147987}{148033}Number two.
{148075}{148121}Waves. Big ones.
{148174}{148199}Go on!
{148333}{148392}Number three.
{148425}{148477}Wind on the cliffs.
{148566}{148611}Number four.
{148635}{148714}Wind through the bushes.
{148992}{149053}Number five.
{149106}{149176}Sad nets belonging to my father.
{149330}{149386}Number six.
{149469}{149584}- Is that enough?|- Church bell of Our Lady of Sorrows...
{149610}{149648}with priest.
{149729}{149779}It's beautiful.
{149796}{149850}I never realized|it was so beautiful.
{149896}{149936}Number seven.
{149995}{150070}Starry sky over the island.
{150141}{150217}Number eight.
{150247}{150293}Pablito's heartbeat.
{150461}{150555}- He will hear everything!|- Really?
{150651}{150680}You can hear it!
{150687}{150756}You can hear Pablito's heart!
{150924}{150957}I'm not calling him Pablito.
{151128}{151222}Five years later...
{152022}{152097}Aw...|but i am not in the picture...
{152331}{152405}And who are you?
{152588}{152615}Come here, Pablito!
{152712}{152754}Pablito, come here!
{153091}{153139}Pablito never saw him.
{153160}{153212}He was born|a few days later.
{153347}{153397}At first, it was hard without him,
{153405}{153445}but now it's better.
{153467}{153534}By the way, this is something|he did for you.
{153557}{153590}I was supposed to send it,
{153606}{153647}but I kept it instead.
{153690}{153725}I listen to it|all the time.
{153969}{154011}Dearest Don Pablo...
{154054}{154073}this is Mario.
{154110}{154158}I hope you haven't forgotten me.
{154194}{154248}Anyway...
{154295}{154388}do you remember that|you once asked me...
{154402}{154491}to say something nice|about my island to your friends...
{154496}{154539}and I couldn't think of anything?
{154562}{154591}Now...
{154617}{154643}...now I know.
{154678}{154745}So I want to send you this tape...
{154760}{154831}which, if you want to,|you can play to your friends.
{154831}{154897}If not, you can listen to it.
{154959}{155010}Then you'll remember me...
{155046}{155082}and Italy.
{155219}{155258}When you left here...
{155288}{155384}I thought you'd taken all|the beautiful things away with you.
{155414}{155453}But now...
{155494}{155528}now I realize...
{155537}{155628}that you left something|behind for me.
{155906}{155974}I aIso want to tell you|that I've written a poem...
{155980}{156035}but you can't hear it|because I'm embarrassed.
{156049}{156130}It's called|''Song for Pablo Neruda.''
{156136}{156175}Even if it's about the sea...
{156204}{156232}it's dedicated to you.
{156285}{156364}If you hadn't come into my life|I never would have written it.
{156415}{156474}I've been invited|to read it in public.
{156508}{156617}And even though I know my voice|will shake, I'll be happy.
{156635}{156720}And you will hear the people|applaud when they hear your name.
{157186}{157211}Comrades!
{157233}{157264}Comrades!
{157411}{157508}Here is our comrade Mario Ruoppolo,
{157525}{157571}who will read you a poem
{157604}{157653}which he dedicated...
{157666}{157754}to the great poet|who is known to us all...
{157767}{157818}Pablo Neruda.
{157941}{157983}Comrades! Comrades!
{158009}{158115}We invite Mario Ruoppolo|onto the platform...
{158144}{158161}Hear that?
{158175}{158209}Hurrah!
{158347}{158427}He's Mario Ruoppolo, let him through.|Let us through.
{158438}{158467}Excuse me!
{158506}{158537}We have to reach the platform.
{158538}{158577}He's Mario Ruoppolo!
{158594}{158607}Mario?
{158634}{158740}- Mario?|- Comrades!|- Mario, where are you?
{158741}{158811}Mario?|Mario Ruoppolo!
{158812}{158973}Comrades, keep calm!
{160726}{160848}For our friend Massimo
