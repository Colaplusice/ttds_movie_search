1
00:00:41,914 --> 00:00:45,031
We have the crew crossing gantry
for capsule ingress.

2
00:00:45,114 --> 00:00:46,706
Roger that.

3
00:00:46,794 --> 00:00:49,149
lnspired by the late President Kennedy,

4
00:00:49,194 --> 00:00:53,949
in only seven years, America has risen
to the challenge of what he called...

5
00:00:53,994 --> 00:00:57,669
"the most hazardous and dangerous
and greatest adventure...

6
00:00:57,754 --> 00:01:00,029
on which man has ever embarked."

7
00:01:00,114 --> 00:01:04,187
After trailing the Russians for years
with our manned space program,

8
00:01:04,274 --> 00:01:07,869
-We got a short!
-and after that sudden, horrible fire...

9
00:01:07,954 --> 00:01:09,945
on the launchpad
during a routine test...

10
00:01:10,034 --> 00:01:12,673
- that killed astronauts Gus Grissom...
- Fire in the cockpit!

11
00:01:12,754 --> 00:01:14,745
- Ed White and Roger Chaffee...
- Get us outta here!

12
00:01:14,834 --> 00:01:18,986
there were serious doubts that we
could beat the Russians to the moon.

13
00:01:19,074 --> 00:01:22,191
But tonight, a mere 18 months
after the tragedy of Apollo 1...

14
00:01:22,274 --> 00:01:26,267
the entire world watched in awe
as Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin...

15
00:01:26,314 --> 00:01:28,225
landed on the moon.

16
00:01:28,314 --> 00:01:30,430
The big news came
just a moment ago.

17
00:01:30,514 --> 00:01:33,267
Mission Control gave
the spacecraft permission...

18
00:01:33,314 --> 00:01:36,192
to go for
the extravehicular activity--

19
00:01:36,234 --> 00:01:38,111
that is, for the walk
on the moon--

20
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:42,745
far earlier than anticipated,
9:00 p.m. Eastern Daylight Time.

21
00:01:42,794 --> 00:01:46,548
lmportant thing when you're penetrating
the lunar module is your attitude...

22
00:01:46,594 --> 00:01:48,471
and your relative speed.

23
00:01:48,514 --> 00:01:51,392
Let's say this is me in the command
module and this is you...

24
00:01:51,474 --> 00:01:53,305
- All right.
- in the LEM.

25
00:01:53,394 --> 00:01:55,066
This thing sticks out.
That's called a probe.

26
00:01:55,154 --> 00:01:56,985
- ls that true?
- Absolutely.

27
00:01:57,074 --> 00:02:01,864
Tracey, when you feel that thing slide in, 
everything's clickin'...

28
00:02:01,954 --> 00:02:04,024
it's like no other
feeling in the world.

29
00:02:05,554 --> 00:02:08,352
- A little liquid propulsion.
- What's the big occasion?

30
00:02:08,394 --> 00:02:10,305
How's it goin' at Mission Control?

31
00:02:10,394 --> 00:02:12,954
lt's a nervous time. They're pacin'
around, smokin' like chimneys.

32
00:02:12,994 --> 00:02:15,303
Gene Kranz is gonna have puppies.
Jim Lovell.

33
00:02:15,394 --> 00:02:17,066
- Hi.
- This is Tracey.

34
00:02:17,154 --> 00:02:18,985
- How do ya do, Tracey?
- This is the man.

35
00:02:19,074 --> 00:02:22,430
Gemini 7. Gemini 12. Apollo 8.
They were the first around the moon.

36
00:02:22,514 --> 00:02:23,867
This guy did ten laps.

37
00:02:23,954 --> 00:02:26,263
With one hand on the wheel.
Make yourselves at home.

38
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:28,185
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where have you been?

39
00:02:28,274 --> 00:02:30,469
This is the last champagne
in Houston.

40
00:02:30,554 --> 00:02:32,385
- Very good. Very good.
- Everything else all right?

41
00:02:32,474 --> 00:02:35,068
- Everything's on course.
- Looks okay. Hey! Cadet Lovell.

42
00:02:35,154 --> 00:02:37,952
- Hey, Dad.
- Put this on ice. Make sure it's cold.

43
00:02:38,034 --> 00:02:40,832
- You gonna get a haircut this week?
- l'm on vacation.

44
00:02:40,914 --> 00:02:43,553
Oh, get a haircut.

45
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:51,788
Well, hello there.

46
00:02:51,874 --> 00:02:55,389
-l wouldn't mind bein' up there tonight.
-God, who wouldn't.

47
00:02:55,474 --> 00:02:58,272
Don't worry. Our day's comin'.

48
00:02:58,314 --> 00:03:01,192
They're not gonna cut
the program before number 14.

49
00:03:01,274 --> 00:03:03,469
- You know, my cousin called.
- Uh-huh.

50
00:03:03,554 --> 00:03:05,784
Asked who we bribed
to get on Jim Lovell's crew.

51
00:03:05,874 --> 00:03:07,068
Yeah.

52
00:03:07,114 --> 00:03:10,424
l told him they wanted
to make sure he got the best.

53
00:03:10,594 --> 00:03:12,664
Well, they got that right.

54
00:03:12,754 --> 00:03:16,906
- What network do we want?
- Come on! Walt! Hey! Put on Walter!

55
00:03:16,954 --> 00:03:18,831
- Walter!
- Jules Bergman!

56
00:03:18,874 --> 00:03:20,273
John, turn it up!

57
00:03:20,314 --> 00:03:23,545
...has completed putting on
the spacesuits and the boots.

58
00:03:23,634 --> 00:03:28,424
l, uh-- l really appreciate you all
coming to this dress rehearsal party...

59
00:03:28,514 --> 00:03:31,551
for my Apollo 12 landing.

60
00:03:31,634 --> 00:03:32,987
Sit down, Conrad.

61
00:03:33,074 --> 00:03:35,429
l think we should all take
a moment to recognize...

62
00:03:35,474 --> 00:03:39,183
the exemplary--
hell, damn near heroic--

63
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:44,268
effort displayed by Neil Armstrong's
backup for this historic moon walk...

64
00:03:44,314 --> 00:03:46,509
and, of course, his crew.

65
00:03:46,554 --> 00:03:49,387
Let's hear it for Jim Lovell,
Ken Mattingly and Fred Haise.

66
00:03:53,754 --> 00:03:57,542
There he is! There he is!
Everybody quiet down!

67
00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,625
Hey! Kids!

68
00:03:59,714 --> 00:04:02,353
We had a good touchdown.

69
00:04:02,434 --> 00:04:07,554
We can verify the position of the
opening l ought to have on the camera.

70
00:04:07,634 --> 00:04:10,706
What?

71
00:04:10,794 --> 00:04:14,787
- Think it's too late for him to abort?
- He still has time to get out.

72
00:04:14,834 --> 00:04:17,428
He just needs somebody to wave him off.
Pull up, Neil!

73
00:04:17,514 --> 00:04:20,586
Pull up! Pull up!

74
00:04:20,674 --> 00:04:24,747
Okay, Neil, we can see you
coming down the ladder now.

75
00:04:24,794 --> 00:04:26,785
Look at those pictures. Wow.

76
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,473
l'm, uh, at the foot of the ladder.

77
00:04:29,554 --> 00:04:34,070
The LEM footpads are only depressed
in the surface about, uh...

78
00:04:34,154 --> 00:04:36,110
one or two inches.

79
00:04:36,154 --> 00:04:39,305
- lt's almost like a powder.
- Armstrong is on the moon.

80
00:04:39,394 --> 00:04:42,784
Neil Armstrong,
38-year-old American...

81
00:04:42,834 --> 00:04:45,553
standing on the surface
of the moon...

82
00:04:46,874 --> 00:04:49,991
on this July 20, 1969.

83
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,787
That's one small step for man...

84
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:58,187
one giant leap for mankind.

85
00:04:58,274 --> 00:05:00,151
His quote was...

86
00:05:00,234 --> 00:05:05,752
"That's one small step for man,
one giant leap for mankind."

87
00:05:12,114 --> 00:05:14,753
Somewhere

88
00:05:14,834 --> 00:05:16,825
Beyond the sea

89
00:05:16,914 --> 00:05:18,905
Somewhere waitin' for me

90
00:05:18,994 --> 00:05:21,462
- You're drunk, Lovell.
- Yeah.

91
00:05:21,554 --> 00:05:23,590
l'm not used to the champagne.

92
00:05:23,634 --> 00:05:25,511
Me neither.

93
00:05:28,194 --> 00:05:31,231
l can't deal with cleaning up.
Let's sell the house.

94
00:05:31,314 --> 00:05:33,703
All right, let's sell the house.

95
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:38,065
They're back inside now
lookin' up at us.

96
00:05:38,154 --> 00:05:40,190
lsn't that somethin'?

97
00:05:40,274 --> 00:05:44,472
l bet Jannie Armstrong doesn't
get a wink of sleep tonight.

98
00:05:44,554 --> 00:05:48,263
When you were on the far side on 8,
l didn't sleep at all.

99
00:05:48,314 --> 00:05:50,874
l just vacuumed
over and over again.

100
00:05:50,954 --> 00:05:55,948
Christopher Columbus,
Charles Lindbergh and Neil Armstrong.

101
00:05:57,274 --> 00:06:00,072
Neil Armstrong.

102
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:14,025
From now on, we live in a world
where man has walked on the moon.

103
00:06:15,714 --> 00:06:17,909
lt's not a miracle.

104
00:06:19,034 --> 00:06:21,468
We just decided to go.

105
00:06:21,554 --> 00:06:24,864
On Apollo 8, we were so close...

106
00:06:24,914 --> 00:06:28,145
just 60 nautical miles down and--

107
00:06:30,714 --> 00:06:33,228
lt was like l could just...

108
00:06:33,314 --> 00:06:36,863
step out and walk
on the face of it.

109
00:06:41,594 --> 00:06:43,949
l want to go back there.

110
00:06:49,714 --> 00:06:51,625
Where's my mountain?

111
00:06:51,674 --> 00:06:55,144
Well, it-- Up there.

112
00:06:55,194 --> 00:06:57,389
lt's, uh, right up by the--

113
00:06:57,474 --> 00:07:00,068
lt's-- Okay, do you see
where the shadow crosses...

114
00:07:00,114 --> 00:07:02,503
the white area there?

115
00:07:02,594 --> 00:07:04,152
That's the Sea of Tranquility...

116
00:07:04,234 --> 00:07:06,509
and your mountain's right there
on the edge of that.

117
00:07:06,554 --> 00:07:09,148
lt's your mountain.
Your mountain, Marilyn. Mount Marilyn.

118
00:07:09,234 --> 00:07:11,748
l don't see it.

119
00:07:13,874 --> 00:07:16,342
Well, you gotta look harder.

120
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:21,143
You-- You-- You look harder...

121
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:25,314
- Jim.
- while l--

122
00:07:25,394 --> 00:07:27,225
Jim!

123
00:07:27,314 --> 00:07:29,464
Groovin'

124
00:07:29,554 --> 00:07:32,671
Down a crowded avenue

125
00:07:34,834 --> 00:07:37,712
The astronaut is only
the most visible member...

126
00:07:37,754 --> 00:07:42,305
of a very large team, and all of us
down to the guy sweeping the floor...

127
00:07:42,354 --> 00:07:44,231
are honored to be a part of it.

128
00:07:44,274 --> 00:07:47,471
What did the man say? "Give me a lever
long enough and l'll move the world"?

129
00:07:47,554 --> 00:07:50,751
That's what we're doing here.
This is divine inspiration.

130
00:07:50,834 --> 00:07:55,544
lt's the best part of each one of us,
the belief that anything is possible.

131
00:07:55,634 --> 00:07:58,990
Things like a computer
that can fit into a single room...

132
00:07:59,074 --> 00:08:02,703
and hold millions of pieces
of information...

133
00:08:02,794 --> 00:08:05,354
or the Saturn 5 rocket.

134
00:08:05,394 --> 00:08:08,272
This is the actual launch vehicle
that will be taking Alan Shepard...

135
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:12,427
and his crew on the first leg
of the Apollo 13 mission.

136
00:08:12,474 --> 00:08:15,307
When are you
going up again, Jim?

137
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:19,228
l'm slated to be the commander
of Apollo 14 sometime late next year.

138
00:08:20,354 --> 00:08:22,390
lf there is an Apollo 14.

139
00:08:22,434 --> 00:08:27,952
Jim, people in my state have been
asking why we're continuing...

140
00:08:28,034 --> 00:08:31,709
to fund this program now that we've
beaten the Russians to the moon.

141
00:08:31,874 --> 00:08:35,025
lmagine if Christopher Columbus
had come back from the new world...

142
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:37,469
and no one returned
in his footsteps.

143
00:08:37,554 --> 00:08:41,103
Attention, all personnel.
Clear level three.

144
00:08:41,194 --> 00:08:43,185
Are there any other questions?

145
00:08:44,314 --> 00:08:46,430
How do you go
to the bathroom in space?

146
00:08:46,514 --> 00:08:49,586
Well, l tell you,
it's a highly technical process...

147
00:08:49,674 --> 00:08:53,826
of cranking down the window and
looking for a gas station, which, uh--

148
00:08:53,874 --> 00:08:56,866
Oh, there's Deke Slayton.

149
00:08:56,914 --> 00:08:59,792
Deke, you might be able
to answer this lady's question.

150
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:03,549
Deke is one of the original Mercury
seven astronauts, ladies and gentlemen.

151
00:09:03,634 --> 00:09:06,831
Now he's our boss. He hands out
the astronauts' flight assignments...

152
00:09:06,874 --> 00:09:09,786
so naturally we kick back
part of our salaries to Deke.

153
00:09:09,874 --> 00:09:13,150
- How much this month?
- Can l have a minute?
Something's come up.

154
00:09:13,234 --> 00:09:15,065
Sure, you b-- Uh, Henry?

155
00:09:16,554 --> 00:09:18,385
Hey!

156
00:09:21,914 --> 00:09:25,543
- Anybody home?
- l'm not being a cheerleader, Mom!

157
00:09:25,594 --> 00:09:27,585
You don't understand!
l worked so hard on this!

158
00:09:27,634 --> 00:09:29,033
Maybe l don't understand...

159
00:09:29,074 --> 00:09:32,271
but you are not wearing that
out in this neighborhood.

160
00:09:32,314 --> 00:09:34,589
She's not even wearing a bra!
You can see everything!

161
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:36,027
Shut up!

162
00:09:36,114 --> 00:09:38,503
- Everybody. Marilyn, trick or treat.
- Jim.

163
00:09:38,554 --> 00:09:42,263
You know that Easter vacation trip
we had planned for Acapulco?

164
00:09:42,354 --> 00:09:43,707
Uh-oh.

165
00:09:43,794 --> 00:09:46,592
l was thinkin' there might be
a slight change in destination.

166
00:09:46,674 --> 00:09:49,029
Really?

167
00:09:49,074 --> 00:09:52,066
Maybe, say... the moon.

168
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:57,307
Al Shepard's ear infection
has flared up...

169
00:09:57,394 --> 00:10:01,387
and we've all been bumped up
to the prime crew of Apollo 13.

170
00:10:01,474 --> 00:10:05,547
Straight to the head of the line
and the Fra Mauro highlands.

171
00:10:05,594 --> 00:10:08,233
Six months?
You're moving up six months?

172
00:10:08,274 --> 00:10:11,630
- Dad, can l please wear this?
- Sure.

173
00:10:11,714 --> 00:10:13,989
- Jim.
- No! No. Absolutely not.

174
00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:16,787
- Don't you want somebody to love
- This stinks!

175
00:10:16,874 --> 00:10:19,104
They're not rushing things, are they?

176
00:10:19,154 --> 00:10:21,065
You're gonna be ready
in six months?

177
00:10:21,114 --> 00:10:25,027
We'll be ready. Boy, l wouldn't want
to be around Al Shepard tonight.

178
00:10:25,074 --> 00:10:27,634
l gotta get over there.
We're gonna have to get up to speed.

179
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:29,466
Go. Go.

180
00:10:29,554 --> 00:10:31,704
l'm gonna walk
on the moon, Marilyn.

181
00:10:31,794 --> 00:10:34,945
l know. l can't believe it.

182
00:10:34,994 --> 00:10:38,350
Naturally, it's 13.
Why 13?

183
00:10:38,394 --> 00:10:40,385
lt comes after 12, hon.

184
00:10:42,154 --> 00:10:44,429
Apollo 13, you are go for docking.

185
00:10:47,354 --> 00:10:51,188
All systems are nominal
and on the line.

186
00:10:51,274 --> 00:10:54,949
Okay, S-4B is stable,
slot panels are drifting free.

187
00:10:54,994 --> 00:10:59,351
The drogue is clear.
The docking target is clear.

188
00:10:59,434 --> 00:11:03,268
Okay, l'm comin' up on that now.
Two... one... mark.

189
00:11:03,314 --> 00:11:06,351
Seventy-five feet.
We're comin' up on docking.

190
00:11:06,434 --> 00:11:10,268
Let's shut down some thrusters on 'em.
We'll see what he does.

191
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:13,470
Whoa. Wait a minute.

192
00:11:13,554 --> 00:11:15,704
l lost something here.
l can't translate up.

193
00:11:15,794 --> 00:11:18,991
Houston, we are drifting
down and away.

194
00:11:19,074 --> 00:11:21,872
- Wanna back off and take another run?
- No, l got it.

195
00:11:21,954 --> 00:11:24,866
Let me just try
and get it stable here.

196
00:11:24,914 --> 00:11:29,351
- l'm gonna reset the high gain.
- Got the target back in the reticle.

197
00:11:29,394 --> 00:11:31,624
We're stable.
Go ahead and recycle the valves.

198
00:11:31,714 --> 00:11:34,672
- Forty feet.
- They're all gray.

199
00:11:37,434 --> 00:11:39,789
Twenty.

200
00:11:39,834 --> 00:11:42,587
- Easy.
- Ten feet.

201
00:11:45,954 --> 00:11:48,343
- Capture.
- That's it!

202
00:11:48,434 --> 00:11:51,949
- That's it.
- Sweet move, Ken. Beautiful.

203
00:11:51,994 --> 00:11:55,304
- Gentlemen, that is the way we do that.
- Man, that woke me up.

204
00:11:55,354 --> 00:12:00,030
Apollo 13 backup crew,
you're up in the simulator.

205
00:12:00,114 --> 00:12:03,231
- Nice job, gentlemen.
- That's three hours of boredom...

206
00:12:03,314 --> 00:12:05,305
followed by seven seconds
of sheer terror.

207
00:12:05,394 --> 00:12:08,704
Good job, guys.
You just won the Christmas turkey.

208
00:12:08,754 --> 00:12:12,906
Nice try, Frank.
You really outfoxed 'em, brother.

209
00:12:12,994 --> 00:12:15,747
Yeah, but it wasn't perfect.
Used up too much fuel.

210
00:12:15,794 --> 00:12:17,671
You're above the curve.

211
00:12:17,714 --> 00:12:21,229
Not by much. Listen, guys,
l wanna work it again.

212
00:12:21,314 --> 00:12:26,149
Hey, we gotta be up with the dawn patrol
headed for Bethpage, what, 0700?

213
00:12:26,194 --> 00:12:28,071
- Wheels up at 0700.
- Yeah, l know...

214
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:30,708
but my rate of turn
is still a little slow.

215
00:12:30,794 --> 00:12:33,388
l really think
we should work it again.

216
00:12:33,474 --> 00:12:38,343
- Well, let's get it right.
- Okay, set it up again, Frank.

217
00:12:38,434 --> 00:12:41,392
Okay, 13 backup crew.
lt'll have to wait.

218
00:12:41,474 --> 00:12:45,228
- Prime crew's up for another run.
- Yeah, baby.

219
00:12:45,554 --> 00:12:48,591
Apollo 13, we show S-4B shutdown...

220
00:12:48,674 --> 00:12:50,585
and all systems are nominal.

221
00:12:50,674 --> 00:12:52,869
Fred, set the S-band omni to B...

222
00:12:52,914 --> 00:12:55,553
and when you get
in the LEM, two forward.

223
00:12:55,634 --> 00:12:59,229
Good shape over here.

224
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:03,626
Hey, we got a problem.

225
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:07,383
- Ken, get your helmet on!
- l can't get it locked!

226
00:13:11,154 --> 00:13:13,145
Oh, God!

227
00:13:24,274 --> 00:13:25,946
Jim!

228
00:13:38,994 --> 00:13:44,114
l thought the stars
would fall down on you.

229
00:13:44,154 --> 00:13:47,226
That's silly.
Stars can't fall on us.

230
00:13:47,314 --> 00:13:49,145
You're a smarter kid than l was.

231
00:13:49,234 --> 00:13:51,748
How long will it take
to get to the moon?

232
00:13:51,794 --> 00:13:57,232
Four days.
But that's pretty fast.

233
00:13:57,274 --> 00:13:59,504
See, this is
the Saturn 4B booster...

234
00:13:59,594 --> 00:14:02,506
and it shoots us
away from the Earth...

235
00:14:02,594 --> 00:14:06,473
as fast as a bullet from a gun...

236
00:14:06,514 --> 00:14:10,905
until the moon's gravity
actually grabs us and pulls us...

237
00:14:10,994 --> 00:14:15,112
into a circle around the moon...

238
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,065
which is called an orbit.

239
00:14:17,154 --> 00:14:19,145
All right?

240
00:14:19,234 --> 00:14:21,748
Fred and l float down the tunnel
into the lunar module...

241
00:14:21,834 --> 00:14:23,665
this spidery-lookin' guy.

242
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:27,588
Only holds two people,
and it's just for landin' on the moon.

243
00:14:27,634 --> 00:14:30,512
And l take the controls
and l steer it around...

244
00:14:30,554 --> 00:14:32,590
and l fly it down...

245
00:14:32,634 --> 00:14:36,183
adjustin' it here,
the attitude there, pitch, roll...

246
00:14:36,274 --> 00:14:39,869
for a nice, soft landing
on the moon.

247
00:14:39,954 --> 00:14:43,230
Better than Neil Armstrong.
Way better than Pete Conrad.

248
00:14:45,874 --> 00:14:51,073
Dad... did you know
the astronauts in the fire?

249
00:14:53,594 --> 00:14:57,507
Yeah. Yeah, l did. l knew the
astronauts in the fire. All of 'em.

250
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:02,590
Could that happen again?

251
00:15:03,954 --> 00:15:06,184
Well, l'll tell ya
somethin' about that fire.

252
00:15:06,234 --> 00:15:09,465
Um, a lot of things went wrong.

253
00:15:10,674 --> 00:15:13,871
The, uh-- The door.

254
00:15:13,914 --> 00:15:18,305
lt's called the hatch. They couldn't
get it open when they needed to get out.

255
00:15:18,354 --> 00:15:21,391
That was one thing. And, uh--

256
00:15:21,434 --> 00:15:24,824
Well, a lot of things
went wrong in that fire.

257
00:15:26,834 --> 00:15:28,904
Did they fix it?

258
00:15:28,994 --> 00:15:32,270
Oh, yes. Absolutely.
We fixed it.

259
00:15:32,314 --> 00:15:34,430
lt's not a problem anymore.

260
00:15:44,914 --> 00:15:48,270
l can't believe they still
have you doing public appearances.

261
00:15:48,354 --> 00:15:52,188
Well, Henry Hurt was... all over me.

262
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:54,947
l know. But with a training
schedule this tight--

263
00:15:54,994 --> 00:15:58,350
Well, it's-- lt's the program, Marilyn.
You know, it's NASA.

264
00:15:58,434 --> 00:16:00,994
Hey! Hey, you're
Jim Lovell, aren't ya?

265
00:16:01,074 --> 00:16:03,304
Hey! Lucky 13!

266
00:16:03,354 --> 00:16:05,345
Right on!

267
00:16:13,114 --> 00:16:15,070
That's the second time
it's done that.

268
00:16:24,274 --> 00:16:26,629
l was looking at the kids'
school schedule coming up.

269
00:16:26,674 --> 00:16:28,073
Yeah?

270
00:16:28,114 --> 00:16:31,345
- lt's a very busy week.
- Yeah.

271
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:35,029
l'm thinking about
not going to the launch.

272
00:16:37,914 --> 00:16:39,791
Huh.

273
00:16:39,874 --> 00:16:42,342
The kids need me at home, honey.

274
00:16:42,434 --> 00:16:46,313
Marilyn, we've had
these kids for awhile now.

275
00:16:46,354 --> 00:16:49,232
They've never kept you from
comin' to the other launches.

276
00:16:49,274 --> 00:16:51,504
But now we have your mother.
She's just had this stroke.

277
00:16:51,594 --> 00:16:52,947
Mom's fine.

278
00:16:53,034 --> 00:16:55,502
lt's not like l've
never been to a launch.

279
00:16:55,594 --> 00:16:57,903
The other wives
have not done three.

280
00:16:57,994 --> 00:17:01,589
l just don't think
l can go through all that.

281
00:17:05,434 --> 00:17:08,232
l'll just be glad
when this one's over.

282
00:17:10,274 --> 00:17:14,347
Well, you're gonna miss
a hell of a show.

283
00:17:21,594 --> 00:17:23,949
- Jim.
- Hey, guys. See ya in a few weeks.

284
00:17:24,034 --> 00:17:27,106
Take care.
Bring us back a moon rock.

285
00:17:51,234 --> 00:17:54,306
So the number 13
doesn't bother you.

286
00:17:54,354 --> 00:17:56,265
Only if it's a Friday, Phil.

287
00:17:56,354 --> 00:18:00,552
Apollo 13, lifting off
at 1300 hours and 13 minutes...

288
00:18:00,594 --> 00:18:03,791
and entering the moon's
gravity on April 13?

289
00:18:03,874 --> 00:18:07,628
Uh, Ken Mattingly here has been
doing some scientific experiments...

290
00:18:07,714 --> 00:18:09,545
regarding that very phenomenon,
haven't you?

291
00:18:09,634 --> 00:18:14,469
Uh, yes. Well, l had a black cat,
uh, walk over a broken mirror...

292
00:18:14,514 --> 00:18:16,311
under the lunar module ladder.

293
00:18:16,394 --> 00:18:18,032
lt didn't seem to be a problem.

294
00:18:18,074 --> 00:18:20,304
We're considering a letter
we got from a fella...

295
00:18:20,394 --> 00:18:24,182
who said we oughta take
a pig with us for good luck.

296
00:18:24,274 --> 00:18:27,152
Does it bother you that the public
regards this flight as routine?

297
00:18:27,234 --> 00:18:30,988
There's nothing routine about flying
to the moon. l can vouch for that.

298
00:18:31,074 --> 00:18:35,625
And, uh, l think that
an astronaut's last mission--

299
00:18:35,674 --> 00:18:40,464
his final flight-- that's always
going to be very special.

300
00:18:40,554 --> 00:18:42,749
Why is this your last, Jim?

301
00:18:42,834 --> 00:18:46,429
l'm in command
of the best ship...

302
00:18:46,514 --> 00:18:49,392
with the best crew
that anybody could ask for...

303
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:53,103
and l'll be walking in a place
where there's 400 degrees difference...

304
00:18:53,194 --> 00:18:56,106
between sunlight and shadow.

305
00:18:56,194 --> 00:19:00,312
l can't imagine, uh,
ever topping that.

306
00:19:05,354 --> 00:19:07,788
We have that scheduled
for 0900 hours tomorrow.

307
00:19:07,874 --> 00:19:09,830
- That's not gonna work, Walter.
- Why?

308
00:19:09,874 --> 00:19:13,708
Freddo and l are gonna be goin' over the
lunar surface experiments tomorrow...

309
00:19:13,794 --> 00:19:16,103
and Ken's gonna be
back in the simulator.

310
00:19:16,154 --> 00:19:18,110
We're gonna be goin' over
the flight plan tonight.

311
00:19:18,194 --> 00:19:21,869
Gonna pay a visit to this machine
after you're hard down. Thanks.

312
00:19:21,914 --> 00:19:24,348
Jim, we've got a problem.

313
00:19:24,434 --> 00:19:29,383
We just got some blood work back from
the lab. Charlie Duke has the measles.

314
00:19:29,474 --> 00:19:31,783
So we need a new backup.

315
00:19:31,834 --> 00:19:35,588
- You've all been exposed to it.
- Oh, l've had the measles.

316
00:19:35,634 --> 00:19:38,194
Ken Mattingly hasn't.

317
00:19:38,234 --> 00:19:42,352
You wanna break up my crew
two days before the launch...

318
00:19:42,394 --> 00:19:46,467
when we can predict each other's moves,
read the tone of each other's voices?

319
00:19:46,514 --> 00:19:48,550
Ken Mattingly will be
getting seriously ill...

320
00:19:48,594 --> 00:19:52,746
precisely when you and Haise will
be ascending from the lunar surface.

321
00:19:52,794 --> 00:19:54,671
That's a lousy time for a fever.

322
00:19:54,714 --> 00:19:57,387
Jack Swigert has been
out of the loop for weeks.

323
00:19:57,434 --> 00:19:59,550
He's fully qualified
to fly this mission.

324
00:19:59,634 --> 00:20:03,070
He's a fine pilot, but when was
the last time he was in a simulator?

325
00:20:03,154 --> 00:20:06,305
l'm sorry, Jim.
l understand how you feel.

326
00:20:06,354 --> 00:20:08,231
We can do one of two things.

327
00:20:08,274 --> 00:20:11,471
We can either scrub Mattingly
and go with Swigert...

328
00:20:11,514 --> 00:20:14,631
or we can bump all three of you
to a later mission.

329
00:20:17,954 --> 00:20:22,505
l've trained
for the Fra Mauro highlands...

330
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:25,705
and this is flight surgeon
horseshit, Deke!

331
00:20:25,754 --> 00:20:30,589
Jim, if you hold out for Ken,
you will not be on Apollo 13.

332
00:20:30,674 --> 00:20:32,710
lt's your decision.

333
00:20:34,714 --> 00:20:37,865
Oh, let it ring.

334
00:20:37,954 --> 00:20:40,627
Listen, l-l gotta take that.

335
00:20:40,714 --> 00:20:42,830
- Oh, why?
- Because l'm on the backup crew...

336
00:20:42,914 --> 00:20:46,589
and the backup crew has to set up
the guest list and book the hotel room.

337
00:20:46,674 --> 00:20:49,711
Swigert. Yeah.

338
00:20:49,754 --> 00:20:52,063
l looked all around

339
00:20:52,114 --> 00:20:56,744
Yes. Yes, sir.
Uh-uh, l understand.

340
00:20:56,794 --> 00:21:00,070
-Thank you, sir.
-Why don't you come with me, little girl

341
00:21:00,114 --> 00:21:01,706
On a magic carpet ride

342
00:21:01,794 --> 00:21:05,707
Well, you don't know
what we can see

343
00:21:05,754 --> 00:21:08,473
Why don't you tell
your dreams to me

344
00:21:21,514 --> 00:21:23,470
Well, l, uh--

345
00:21:27,114 --> 00:21:28,945
Damn.

346
00:21:33,994 --> 00:21:36,588
Medical guys.

347
00:21:36,634 --> 00:21:41,708
l had a feeling when they started doing
all the blood tests that, uh--

348
00:21:44,674 --> 00:21:49,384
l mean, l know it's their ass if l get
sick up there, but, l mean-- Jesus!

349
00:22:02,034 --> 00:22:04,594
Oh, boy.

350
00:22:04,634 --> 00:22:08,229
Swigert, he'll be fine. He's, uh--

351
00:22:10,314 --> 00:22:12,270
He's strong.

352
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:18,383
lt'll be a hell of a mission.
One for the books.

353
00:22:22,234 --> 00:22:25,306
You sure about this?
Why don't l talk to Deke?

354
00:22:25,394 --> 00:22:27,954
l'm sure we can work this out.

355
00:22:29,434 --> 00:22:32,267
This was my call.

356
00:22:41,274 --> 00:22:43,424
Must've been a tough one.

357
00:22:48,754 --> 00:22:51,188
Look, l don't have the measles.

358
00:22:52,354 --> 00:22:54,822
l'm not gonna get the measles.

359
00:22:58,354 --> 00:23:01,232
Shit. Ken, wait up.

360
00:23:04,514 --> 00:23:08,427
Trajectory is holding steady.
We're right on the line.

361
00:23:08,514 --> 00:23:13,747
We're into program 64. We're in 05 Gs,
so we're feeling that gravity now.

362
00:23:13,834 --> 00:23:17,713
Houston, we are at 400,000 feet
passing entry interphase.

363
00:23:17,754 --> 00:23:19,631
About to lose signal.

364
00:23:19,674 --> 00:23:24,111
Reentry data is nominal,
and we have radio blackout.

365
00:23:26,234 --> 00:23:29,590
What's the story here?

366
00:23:29,674 --> 00:23:33,508
l got a corridor light.
We're comin' in too shallow.

367
00:23:33,554 --> 00:23:36,273
l'm goin' to manual.

368
00:23:39,154 --> 00:23:42,351
- Houston, switching to S.C.S.
- Roger, Thirteen.

369
00:23:42,394 --> 00:23:45,067
Okay, we're at three Gs.

370
00:23:45,114 --> 00:23:47,947
Five Gs.

371
00:23:47,994 --> 00:23:49,871
We're comin' in too steep.

372
00:23:49,914 --> 00:23:53,509
l'm gonna stay in this roll,
see if l can pull us out.

373
00:23:53,554 --> 00:23:55,704
We're at eight Gs.

374
00:23:55,794 --> 00:23:58,262
Nine. Ten.

375
00:24:00,434 --> 00:24:03,312
- We're at 12 Gs.
- Twelve Gs. We're burnin' up.

376
00:24:03,354 --> 00:24:06,790
Damn it!

377
00:24:06,834 --> 00:24:09,826
l gave 'em a false indicator light
at entry interphase.

378
00:24:09,874 --> 00:24:11,785
Even Mattingly didn't
get it the first time.

379
00:24:11,834 --> 00:24:13,870
How ya feelin', Freddo?

380
00:24:13,954 --> 00:24:16,263
Char-broiled.

381
00:24:19,714 --> 00:24:21,545
So what happened?

382
00:24:21,634 --> 00:24:24,353
Came in too steep. We're dead.

383
00:24:24,434 --> 00:24:29,827
- No shit.
- Yeah, we were into program 67 there.

384
00:24:32,514 --> 00:24:35,267
Okay, we're gonna
do this again, obviously...

385
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:37,828
but give us a minute
to get our switches reset.

386
00:24:37,874 --> 00:24:39,785
Jim, could we have a word?

387
00:24:41,874 --> 00:24:43,785
Oh, sure, Deke.

388
00:24:49,594 --> 00:24:52,984
We're going to drop off line
and debrief.

389
00:24:54,074 --> 00:24:56,542
- So?
- Well...

390
00:24:56,594 --> 00:25:00,189
if l had a dollar for every time
they killed me in this thing...

391
00:25:00,274 --> 00:25:03,107
l wouldn't have
to work for you, Deke.

392
00:25:07,954 --> 00:25:10,627
Well, we have two days.
We'll be ready.

393
00:25:10,674 --> 00:25:12,630
Let's do it again.

394
00:25:13,834 --> 00:25:15,711
Do it again.

395
00:25:25,394 --> 00:25:27,703
Margaret, get them!
Fred, Stephen, come here!

396
00:25:27,794 --> 00:25:30,103
- Daddy!
- Watch out! You'll fall!

397
00:25:30,194 --> 00:25:32,708
We can't go across that road.

398
00:25:32,754 --> 00:25:36,349
We don't want Daddy to get our germs
and get sick in outer space.

399
00:25:36,434 --> 00:25:40,188
Hey, boys. Not givin' your mom
a hard time, are ya?

400
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:42,663
Princess, you look beautiful.

401
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:46,991
Jack!

402
00:26:03,474 --> 00:26:06,113
Well, hey, that looks
like Marilyn Lovell.

403
00:26:06,194 --> 00:26:09,072
But it can't be.
She's not coming to the launch.

404
00:26:09,154 --> 00:26:10,985
l heard it was gonna be
a hell of a show.

405
00:26:11,074 --> 00:26:12,666
Who told you that?

406
00:26:12,754 --> 00:26:15,143
Some guy l know.

407
00:26:17,754 --> 00:26:19,631
You can't live without me.

408
00:26:21,154 --> 00:26:23,668
Okay, folks.
Let's say good night.

409
00:26:23,754 --> 00:26:25,870
- We got a big day tomorrow.
- Good night!

410
00:26:25,954 --> 00:26:28,673
You hear about Ken?

411
00:26:28,754 --> 00:26:31,552
Yeah.

412
00:26:45,754 --> 00:26:48,746
One, two.

413
00:26:48,794 --> 00:26:50,864
Stand back, please.

414
00:26:53,434 --> 00:26:55,231
Ah, Guenter Wendt.

415
00:26:55,314 --> 00:26:57,509
l wonder where Guenter went?

416
00:26:57,554 --> 00:26:59,624
Jim.

417
00:27:01,634 --> 00:27:05,468
- You walk on ze moon, ja?
- Ja. Ja, we walk and--

418
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:08,148
and we talk on ze moon.

419
00:27:15,474 --> 00:27:17,704
How do you feel? Pretty good?

420
00:27:17,754 --> 00:27:21,190
Good. Might be a little
warmer in here, huh?

421
00:27:21,234 --> 00:27:24,749
- How are you today? Ready?
- Good. Yeah.

422
00:27:42,314 --> 00:27:45,829
Oh! Oh! Jeez! Oh!

423
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:52,032
Oh, God, no!

424
00:27:55,754 --> 00:27:57,824
Oh, no.

425
00:28:02,154 --> 00:28:05,544
- Okay, we have the oxygen burn system?
- Check.

426
00:28:05,634 --> 00:28:08,592
- We have the helmet restraint ring?
- Check.

427
00:28:17,834 --> 00:28:20,109
Communication umbilical on.

428
00:28:20,194 --> 00:28:22,071
- Fred.
- What?

429
00:28:22,154 --> 00:28:24,190
- Gum.
- Aw, sorry.

430
00:28:25,874 --> 00:28:27,751
Thanks.

431
00:28:29,954 --> 00:28:32,422
l'm gonna give these guys
a beautiful ride.

432
00:28:32,474 --> 00:28:33,873
Sure you will, Jack.

433
00:28:46,714 --> 00:28:48,705
You need more air?

434
00:29:03,834 --> 00:29:06,029
You want some apple?

435
00:29:06,114 --> 00:29:07,945
- Marilyn, hey!
- Mary.

436
00:29:08,034 --> 00:29:10,184
Aw, l hate this already.

437
00:29:10,234 --> 00:29:12,270
You're not just about to pop,
are you?

438
00:29:12,354 --> 00:29:16,063
No. l got 30 days
'til this blast-off.

439
00:29:58,154 --> 00:30:00,031
This is for Gene.

440
00:30:02,554 --> 00:30:05,944
Mrs. Kranz has pulled out
the needle and thread again.

441
00:30:06,034 --> 00:30:08,264
The last one looked like
he bought it off a gypsy.

442
00:30:08,354 --> 00:30:10,709
Well, you can't argue with tradition.

443
00:30:10,794 --> 00:30:12,625
Copy that.

444
00:30:12,714 --> 00:30:14,625
This is from your wife, Gene.

445
00:30:14,674 --> 00:30:16,551
Thank you, Tom.

446
00:30:16,594 --> 00:30:18,630
l was startin' to get worried.

447
00:30:19,794 --> 00:30:21,671
There we go.

448
00:30:21,714 --> 00:30:25,753
- l like it. l like that one, Gene.
- Sharp, Gene.

449
00:30:38,914 --> 00:30:41,223
Jim, you're all set.

450
00:30:50,234 --> 00:30:52,225
Very sharp.

451
00:30:52,274 --> 00:30:54,504
Hey, Gene, l guess we can go now.

452
00:30:54,554 --> 00:30:57,068
Save it for splashdown, guys.

453
00:31:15,194 --> 00:31:18,823
Apollo 13 flight controllers,
listen up.

454
00:31:18,914 --> 00:31:21,348
Give me a go,
no go for launch.

455

466
00:31:45,914 --> 00:31:48,587
Roger that, Houston.

467
00:31:48,674 --> 00:31:50,983
Pad leader, what's your status?

468
00:31:51,034 --> 00:31:53,025
We are go for launch.

469
00:31:53,074 --> 00:31:55,463
T minus 60 seconds and counting.

470
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:21,631
- Stand by.
- Roger.

471
00:32:38,034 --> 00:32:40,264
Fuel pumps.

472
00:32:40,314 --> 00:32:43,624
This is it. A few bumps
and we're haulin' the mail.

473
00:32:49,114 --> 00:32:53,187
Control, this is Guidance.
They're ready for takeoff.

474
00:32:55,314 --> 00:32:57,066
We are go for launch.

475
00:32:57,314 --> 00:33:01,023
- T minus--
- 15... 14...

476
00:33:01,074 --> 00:33:04,862
13... 12... 11...

477
00:33:04,914 --> 00:33:06,791
ten... nine...

478
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:09,143
eight... seven...

479
00:33:09,234 --> 00:33:12,112
six... ignition sequence starts...

480
00:33:12,194 --> 00:33:15,869
three... two... one...

481
00:33:15,954 --> 00:33:17,785
ignition!

482
00:33:38,234 --> 00:33:40,702
The clock is running!

483
00:33:47,994 --> 00:33:50,508
We have lift-off!

484
00:34:02,834 --> 00:34:07,624
Houston, we have cleared
the tower at 1313.

485
00:34:07,714 --> 00:34:09,705
Okay, guys, we got it.

486
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:24,834
Come on, baby. Come on.

487
00:34:28,754 --> 00:34:30,984
Altitude is on the line.

488
00:34:31,074 --> 00:34:33,713
Velocity right on the line.

489
00:34:34,994 --> 00:34:37,030
Roll complete. We are pitching.

490
00:34:37,074 --> 00:34:41,067
Thirteen, stand by
for mode one Bravo.

491
00:34:44,954 --> 00:34:47,343
FlDO, how we lookin'?

492
00:34:47,434 --> 00:34:50,028
Looks good, Flight.
Right down the middle.

493
00:34:50,074 --> 00:34:54,909
We see your B.P.C.
is clear, Thirteen.

494
00:34:54,994 --> 00:34:57,224
Roger. E.D.S. to manual.

495
00:34:57,314 --> 00:34:59,953
lnboard.

496
00:35:00,034 --> 00:35:03,106
Get ready for a little jolt, fellas.

497
00:35:15,874 --> 00:35:18,468
That was some little jolt.

498
00:35:22,914 --> 00:35:24,905
Tower jett.

499
00:35:34,034 --> 00:35:37,390
Houston, we've got a center engine
cutoff. Go on the other four.

500
00:35:40,794 --> 00:35:43,433
Roger that, Thirteen.
We show the same.

501
00:35:43,474 --> 00:35:45,544
Booster, can you
confirm that cutoff?

502
00:35:45,634 --> 00:35:48,751
- Roger. Looks like we lost it.
- FlDO, what's that going to do?

503
00:35:48,794 --> 00:35:50,193
Stand by, Flight.

504
00:35:50,234 --> 00:35:52,873
l need to know if the l.U.'s
correcting for the shutdown.

505
00:36:02,194 --> 00:36:04,583
Houston, what's the story
on engine five?

506
00:36:06,834 --> 00:36:10,668
We're still go. We'll be all right
as long as we don't lose another one.

507
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:14,508
- Roger that.
- Thirteen, we're not sure
why the inboard was out...

508
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,546
but the other engines are go,
so we're gonna burn those engines...

509
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,465
a little bit longer.

510
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:22,193
Roger that.
Our gimbals are good.

511
00:36:22,234 --> 00:36:24,873
Our trim is good.

512
00:36:26,594 --> 00:36:29,506
Looks like we just had
our glitch for this mission.

513
00:36:39,314 --> 00:36:42,431
- 13, stand by for staging.
- Roger that.

514
00:36:42,514 --> 00:36:46,473
S-2 shutdown. S-4B ignition.

515
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:48,744
Thrust looks good, Flight.

516
00:36:50,194 --> 00:36:52,389
Flight, S-4B cutoff
in ten seconds.

517
00:36:52,434 --> 00:36:56,632
Thirteen, this is Houston.
Predicted cutoff is 12 plus 34, over.

518
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,310
Coming up on 12 minutes 34.

519
00:37:02,354 --> 00:37:05,187
- And--
- SECO!

520
00:37:05,234 --> 00:37:07,748
Shutdown.

521
00:37:07,794 --> 00:37:11,992
And that, gentlemen,
is how we do that.

522
00:37:36,274 --> 00:37:38,663
Oh, boy. Hope l can sleep.

523
00:37:38,714 --> 00:37:40,705
Mom, that was loud.

524
00:37:40,754 --> 00:37:43,314
Here, hold my hand.

525
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:45,954
l can't believe
you did this four times.

526
00:37:46,034 --> 00:37:47,387
The worst part's over.

527
00:37:47,474 --> 00:37:49,465
lt is?

528
00:37:49,554 --> 00:37:54,230
Listen, this doesn't stop for me
until he lands on that aircraft carrier.

529
00:37:54,314 --> 00:37:56,350
Well, you just look
so calm about it.

530
00:37:56,434 --> 00:38:00,552
lf the flight surgeon had to okay me
for this mission, l'd be grounded.

531
00:38:00,594 --> 00:38:03,313
Mrs. Lovell! Mrs. Haise!
Can we speak to you?

532
00:38:03,354 --> 00:38:05,470
Can we just have
a word with you?

533
00:38:05,554 --> 00:38:07,909
Remember, you're proud,
happy and thrilled.

534
00:38:07,954 --> 00:38:09,353
Mrs. Lovell!

535
00:38:09,394 --> 00:38:12,067
- How're ya feeling?
- Well, very proud...

536
00:38:12,114 --> 00:38:14,309
and very happy,
and we're thrilled.

537
00:38:17,714 --> 00:38:20,706
Flight, Booster.
l show S-4B shutdown.

538
00:38:20,754 --> 00:38:23,632
T.L.l. is on the money.
Looks good, Flight.

539
00:38:23,674 --> 00:38:26,029
Roger, FlDO.

540
00:38:26,074 --> 00:38:30,750
Okay, guys.
We're goin' to the moon.

541
00:38:30,834 --> 00:38:33,473
Flight, we have reacquisition
of signal at Hawaii.

542
00:38:33,554 --> 00:38:35,385
Flight, everything looks good.

543
00:38:35,474 --> 00:38:38,193
Okay, Houston. C.M.P. here.

544
00:38:38,234 --> 00:38:41,385
l've exchanged couches with Jim.
l'm in the pilot's seat.

545
00:38:41,434 --> 00:38:46,030
l'm gonna go ahead and get set
for transposition and docking.

546
00:38:46,074 --> 00:38:48,508
Roger that, Jack.

547
00:38:59,554 --> 00:39:01,863
Freddo, you okay?

548
00:39:05,234 --> 00:39:08,385
Okay, let's get turned around
and pick up the lunar module.

549
00:39:08,434 --> 00:39:12,029
Odyssey, you're go
for pyro arm and docking,

550
00:39:12,114 --> 00:39:15,151
and we recommend you secure
cabin pressurization.

551
00:39:15,194 --> 00:39:17,867
Roger that.

552
00:39:17,914 --> 00:39:22,590
Okay, we're ready
for C.S.M. separation.

553
00:39:22,674 --> 00:39:27,111
Okay, S.M.R.C.S.
isol valves are all gray.

554
00:39:27,154 --> 00:39:29,304
Okay, Swigert,
command module pilot...

555
00:39:29,394 --> 00:39:31,544
she's all yours.

556
00:39:35,074 --> 00:39:37,668
Houston, we've got
a good separation.

557
00:39:37,714 --> 00:39:40,353
- The S-4B is stable.
- Translation looks good.

558
00:39:40,434 --> 00:39:43,790
- We confirm that, Thirteen.
- We're gonna start to pitch around...

559
00:39:43,874 --> 00:39:45,705
to line up with the LEM.

560
00:39:45,794 --> 00:39:47,705
You know, Freddo, Frank Borman...

561
00:39:47,794 --> 00:39:50,627
was upchuckin' most of the way
to the moon on Apollo 8.

562
00:39:50,674 --> 00:39:54,587
l'm all right. l just ate too much
breakfast. Let's go to work.

563
00:39:55,954 --> 00:39:57,865
And pitching up.

564
00:39:57,954 --> 00:40:01,230
Pitch rate,
2.5 degrees per second.

565
00:40:01,274 --> 00:40:04,744
Roger, Jack.
We see you pitching around.

566
00:40:04,794 --> 00:40:06,671
Keep an eye on that telemetry.

567
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:10,912
Roger that. lf Swigert can't dock
this thing, we don't have a mission.

568
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:15,310
- How's the alignment?
- G.D.C. align.

569
00:40:19,474 --> 00:40:22,625
Thrusting forward.

570
00:40:22,674 --> 00:40:24,869
One hundred feet.

571
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:31,308
Watch the alignment, now.

572
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:41,350
Ah, don't worry, guys.

573
00:40:41,394 --> 00:40:43,749
l'm on top of it.

574
00:40:46,674 --> 00:40:52,192
- FlDO, let me know when you're ready.
- Okay, let's uplink that.

575
00:40:52,274 --> 00:40:55,152
- How we lookin'?
- We're not there yet. Forty feet.

576
00:40:56,794 --> 00:40:58,989
Twenty.

577
00:41:02,874 --> 00:41:05,104
Come on, rookie,
park that thing.

578
00:41:10,674 --> 00:41:12,426
Ten feet.

579
00:41:23,154 --> 00:41:25,622
- Capture.
- That's it.

580
00:41:25,714 --> 00:41:28,990
- Talk back is barber pole.
- Go ahead and retract.

581
00:41:32,434 --> 00:41:34,629
Houston, we have hard dock.

582
00:41:34,674 --> 00:41:37,666
Roger, understand.
That's a good deal, Jack.

583
00:41:37,714 --> 00:41:40,182
Let's start back up with procedure 17.

584
00:41:40,314 --> 00:41:43,704
Okay, Houston, we have LEM extraction.

585
00:41:43,794 --> 00:41:45,705
We copy that, Thirteen.

586
00:41:45,754 --> 00:41:47,904
Now you're off
to the Fra Mauro highlands.

587
00:41:47,954 --> 00:41:51,663
- l gotta get out of this suit.
- Houston, we are ready...

588
00:41:51,754 --> 00:41:53,790
for the beginning
of the P.T.C...

589
00:41:53,874 --> 00:41:58,026
and l think once we're in that
barbecue roll, uh, Jack and l will eat.

590
00:41:58,074 --> 00:42:00,542
- Hey, l'm hungry.
- Are you sure?

591
00:42:00,594 --> 00:42:04,030
l could eat the ass
out of a dead rhinoceros.

592
00:42:07,434 --> 00:42:10,028
- We got a smooth one, huh?
- By the numbers so far.

593
00:42:10,074 --> 00:42:14,670
We just ran a minimum load test on the
cooling system. Let me clean this up.

594
00:42:14,714 --> 00:42:16,750
- See you tomorrow.
- Take care.

595
00:42:30,354 --> 00:42:32,663
lt's too bad we can't
demonstrate this on TV.

596
00:42:34,194 --> 00:42:36,628
What a shame.

597
00:42:40,594 --> 00:42:43,631
Okay. Overboard dump comin' up.

598
00:42:46,394 --> 00:42:49,192
Here it comes...

599
00:42:49,234 --> 00:42:51,145
the constellation Urion.

600
00:42:54,554 --> 00:42:57,068
Now, that's a beautiful sight.

601
00:42:57,114 --> 00:43:00,902
Barbara. Barbara, we are going
to your father's broadcast.

602
00:43:00,954 --> 00:43:03,468
No! l'm never coming out!

603
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:07,507
l hate Paul! No one else
can ever play their records again!

604
00:43:07,594 --> 00:43:10,825
She's still going on about
the stupid Beatles breaking up?

605
00:43:10,874 --> 00:43:13,627
- They're not stupid! You're stupid!
- Barbara!

606
00:43:13,714 --> 00:43:15,067
l know you're in mourning.

607
00:43:15,154 --> 00:43:17,429
l'm not going, Mom!
Dad won't know if we're there!

608
00:43:17,514 --> 00:43:21,871
The whole world is going to be watching
this broadcast, and so are we.

609
00:43:21,914 --> 00:43:23,791
Excuse me while l--

610
00:43:24,034 --> 00:43:27,026
Okay, uh, good evening, America...

611
00:43:27,114 --> 00:43:29,787
and welcome aboard Apollo 13.

612
00:43:29,874 --> 00:43:33,628
l'm Jim Lovell, and we're
broadcasting to you tonight...

613
00:43:33,714 --> 00:43:37,389
from an altitude of almost
200,000 miles...

614
00:43:37,474 --> 00:43:40,227
away from the face
of the earth...

615
00:43:40,274 --> 00:43:43,072
and we have a pretty good show
in store for you tonight.

616
00:43:43,154 --> 00:43:45,224
We are going
to show you just what...

617
00:43:45,314 --> 00:43:48,909
-Susan. Barbara.
-our life is like for the three of us...

618
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:51,633
- in the vast expanse of outer space.
- Double!

619
00:43:51,714 --> 00:43:54,148
One of the first things
we'd like to do...

620
00:43:54,194 --> 00:43:57,345
is provide you with the
appropriate background music.

621
00:43:58,354 --> 00:44:00,914
So, uh, hit it there, Freddo.

622
00:44:00,954 --> 00:44:04,105
Hello, world!

623
00:44:15,314 --> 00:44:19,546
That, uh, was supposed
to be the theme to 2001...

624
00:44:19,634 --> 00:44:22,023
in honor of
our command module Odyssey...

625
00:44:22,114 --> 00:44:25,709
but there seems to have been
a change in the program.

626
00:44:25,754 --> 00:44:30,305
When l go up on 19, l'm gonna take my
entire collection of Johnny Cash along.

627
00:44:33,274 --> 00:44:36,311
- Hey, Marilyn.
- Where's their broadcast?

628
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:39,470
All the networks dumped us.

629
00:44:39,514 --> 00:44:41,584
One of them said we made
goin' to the moon...

630
00:44:41,674 --> 00:44:44,234
as exciting as a trip to Pittsburgh.

631
00:44:45,234 --> 00:44:47,668
My son's supposed to be on.

632
00:44:47,754 --> 00:44:50,188
He's in outer space.

633
00:44:50,274 --> 00:44:54,904
This is all the channels
we get, Mrs. Lovell.

634
00:44:56,114 --> 00:44:58,992
lt's that damn TV Guide again.

635
00:44:59,034 --> 00:45:01,502
Ruthless porters.

636
00:45:01,554 --> 00:45:03,465
Savage baggage masters--

637
00:45:08,634 --> 00:45:11,432
When l was just a lad of ten

638
00:45:11,474 --> 00:45:14,591
My father said to me

639
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:18,030
- Come here and take--
- Do they know they're not on the air?

640
00:45:18,114 --> 00:45:20,582
We'll tell them
when they get back.

641
00:45:20,634 --> 00:45:22,590
Don't put your faith
in love, my boy

642
00:45:22,674 --> 00:45:25,234
My father said to me

643
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:29,062
Uh, well, if anyone from the,
uh, l.R.S. is watching...

644
00:45:29,154 --> 00:45:32,112
l forgot to file my 1040 return.

645
00:45:32,194 --> 00:45:34,662
l meant to do it today, but, uh--

646
00:45:34,754 --> 00:45:36,984
That's no joke.
They'll jump on him.

647
00:45:38,994 --> 00:45:42,589
Well, folks, let's head on down
to the lunar excursion module.

648
00:45:42,674 --> 00:45:44,027
Follow me.

649
00:45:44,114 --> 00:45:46,674
Now, when we get ready
to land on the moon...

650
00:45:46,714 --> 00:45:50,548
Fred Haise and l will float
through this access tunnel...

651
00:45:50,634 --> 00:45:52,511
into the lunar module, leaving--

652
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:55,552
EECOM, that stir's gonna be...

653
00:45:55,634 --> 00:45:59,070
on both H2 and both O2 tanks,
is that correct?

654
00:45:59,154 --> 00:46:01,224
...the spacecraft
will remain connected.

655
00:46:03,194 --> 00:46:06,072
Well, folks, as you can
probably tell...

656
00:46:06,154 --> 00:46:09,226
the Aquarius isn't much bigger
than a couple of telephone booths.

657
00:46:09,274 --> 00:46:11,663
The skin of the LEM
in some places...

658
00:46:11,754 --> 00:46:13,870
is only as...

659
00:46:13,914 --> 00:46:16,382
as thick as a couple of layers...

660
00:46:16,434 --> 00:46:19,790
of tinfoil, and that's all that
protects us from the vacuum of space.

661
00:46:19,834 --> 00:46:24,589
We get away with this because the LEM is
designed only for flight in outer space.

662
00:46:24,674 --> 00:46:28,587
Fred Haise, Renaissance man.

663
00:46:28,634 --> 00:46:33,150
Okay, we'll head back up the tunnel now
and back into the Odyssey.

664
00:46:34,674 --> 00:46:38,667
When you and your baby
have a fallin' out

665
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,632
All right, we've returned to the--

666
00:46:41,714 --> 00:46:44,592
Stand by one, Houston.

667
00:46:44,674 --> 00:46:46,949
Gotcha!

668
00:46:46,994 --> 00:46:50,828
Houston, that bang you heard was
Fred Haise on the cabin repress valve.

669
00:46:50,914 --> 00:46:53,428
He gets our hearts goin'
every time with that one.

670
00:46:53,514 --> 00:46:55,903
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

671
00:46:55,954 --> 00:47:00,789
Okay, we're, uh, about
to close out the Aquarius...

672
00:47:00,874 --> 00:47:03,468
and, uh, return to the Odyssey.

673
00:47:03,514 --> 00:47:08,269
Our next broadcast will be from
Fra Mauro on the surface of the moon.

674
00:47:08,354 --> 00:47:13,508
So, uh, this is the crew
of the Apollo 13...

675
00:47:13,554 --> 00:47:16,830
wishing everyone
back on Earth a...

676
00:47:16,914 --> 00:47:19,109
a pleasant evening.

677
00:47:22,354 --> 00:47:25,312
All right.

678
00:47:26,354 --> 00:47:28,265
Daddy was funny.

679
00:47:28,314 --> 00:47:30,669
They might air a few minutes
of it on the news tonight.

680
00:47:30,714 --> 00:47:33,626
You'd think so.

681
00:47:33,714 --> 00:47:35,750
- Bye.
- Bye.

682
00:47:36,034 --> 00:47:40,073
Well, between Jack's back taxes
and the Fred Haise Show...

683
00:47:40,154 --> 00:47:43,430
l'd say that was a pretty
successful broadcast.

684
00:47:43,514 --> 00:47:46,950
- That was an excellent show.
- Thank you very much, Houston.

685
00:47:47,034 --> 00:47:49,184
We've got a couple of
housekeeping procedures.

686
00:47:49,274 --> 00:47:53,825
We'd like you to roll right
to 0-6-0 and null your rates.

687
00:47:53,914 --> 00:47:57,589
Roger that.
Rolling right, 0-6-0.

688
00:48:01,514 --> 00:48:05,223
And then if you could give
your oxygen tanks a stir.

689
00:48:05,314 --> 00:48:07,066
Roger that.

690
00:48:39,554 --> 00:48:42,068
Hey, we've got a problem here.

691
00:48:42,114 --> 00:48:44,674
- What did you do?
- Nothing. l stirred the tanks.

692
00:48:44,714 --> 00:48:47,103
- Whoa!
- Hey!

693
00:48:48,954 --> 00:48:52,833
Uh, this is Houston.
Say again please.

694
00:48:52,914 --> 00:48:57,783
Houston, we have a problem.
We have a main bus B undervolt.

695
00:48:57,874 --> 00:49:00,991
- We've got a lot
of thruster activity here.
- What's with the computer now?

696
00:49:01,034 --> 00:49:05,027
lt just went off line.
There's another master alarm.

697
00:49:05,114 --> 00:49:07,025
- l'm checking the quad.
- That was no repress valve.

698
00:49:07,074 --> 00:49:09,793
- Maybe it's in quad C.
l'm gonna reconfigure the R.C.S.
- We've got a computer restart.

699
00:49:09,874 --> 00:49:11,910
- We've got a ping light.
- The way these are firing
doesn't make sense.

700
00:49:11,994 --> 00:49:15,384
We've got multiple caution and warning,
Houston. We've got to reset and restart.

701
00:49:15,474 --> 00:49:17,669
l'm going to S.C.S.

702
00:49:19,594 --> 00:49:22,427
Jesus. Flight, their
heart rates are skyrocketing.

703
00:49:22,514 --> 00:49:26,029
- EECOM, what's your data telling you?
- O2 tank two not reading at all.

704
00:49:26,114 --> 00:49:29,584
Tank one is at 725 psi
and falling.

705
00:49:29,634 --> 00:49:33,070
Fuel cells one and three
are, uh--

706
00:49:33,154 --> 00:49:35,668
Oh, boy, what's going on here?
Flight, let me get back to you.

707
00:49:35,714 --> 00:49:38,672
Flight, GNC.
They're all over the place.

708
00:49:38,754 --> 00:49:41,393
- They keep yawing close to gimbal lock.
- l keep losing radio signal.

709
00:49:41,474 --> 00:49:43,305
Flight, their antennae
must be flipped around.

710
00:49:43,394 --> 00:49:45,589
They're gonna have to do it
manually if they do it at all.

711
00:49:45,634 --> 00:49:47,147
One at a time, people.

712
00:49:47,234 --> 00:49:51,068
ls this an instrumentation problem
or are we looking at real power loss?

713
00:49:51,154 --> 00:49:53,463
lt's reading a quadruple failure.
That can't happen.

714
00:49:53,514 --> 00:49:55,391
lt's got to be
instrumentation.

715
00:49:55,434 --> 00:49:58,153
Let's get the hatch buttoned.
The LEM might have been hit by a meteor.

716
00:49:58,234 --> 00:50:01,067
The tunnel's really torquin'
with all this movement.

717
00:50:01,154 --> 00:50:04,464
Houston, we had a pretty large bang
there associated with a master alarm.

718
00:50:04,514 --> 00:50:06,982
Shit, it's main bus A.

719
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:11,784
- Main bus A undervolt?
- Main bus A undervolt down to--

720
00:50:11,874 --> 00:50:15,583
lt's reading 25 and a half.
Main bus B is reading zip now.

721
00:50:15,674 --> 00:50:17,744
We got a wicked shimmy up here.

722
00:50:17,794 --> 00:50:20,388
These guys are talking
about bangs and shimmies.

723
00:50:20,474 --> 00:50:22,305
Doesn't sound like instrumentation.

724
00:50:22,394 --> 00:50:24,988
- You are breaking up, 13.
- Can't get this hatch to seal.

725
00:50:25,074 --> 00:50:29,306
Just stow it. lf we'd been hit
by a meteor, we'd be dead by now.

726
00:50:29,394 --> 00:50:31,350
l'm gonna try to get us
out of this lurch.

727
00:50:31,394 --> 00:50:33,954
Houston, did you say
switch to omni Bravo?

728
00:50:34,034 --> 00:50:37,151
- Roger that, Thirteen.
- The signal strength went way down.

729
00:50:37,194 --> 00:50:40,027
lt's fighting me. What's the story?
We keep flirting with gimbal lock.

730
00:50:40,074 --> 00:50:44,829
We need a confirmation.
What systems do you have down?

731
00:50:44,914 --> 00:50:47,872
- l'm having a hard time, Rick.
- S.M.R.C.S. Helium one.

732
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:50,707
- Did you say switch to omni Charlie?
- A and C are barber pole.

733
00:50:50,754 --> 00:50:53,507
Houston, l'm switching over
quad C to main A.

734
00:50:53,594 --> 00:50:54,947
Roger that, Thirteen.

735
00:50:55,034 --> 00:50:58,106
Okay, Houston, fuel cell one,
fuel cell three.

736
00:50:58,154 --> 00:51:01,988
We got a main bus B undervolt,
cryo pressure, suit compressor.

737
00:51:02,074 --> 00:51:07,068
What don't we have?
A.C. bus one, A.C. bus two...

738
00:51:07,154 --> 00:51:10,271
command module computer
and O2 flow high.

739
00:51:10,354 --> 00:51:12,822
l don't know. Maybe this is
a caution and warning failure.

740
00:51:12,914 --> 00:51:17,829
Houston, we are venting
something out into space.

741
00:51:17,914 --> 00:51:23,193
l can see it outside
of window one right now.

742
00:51:23,234 --> 00:51:27,944
lt's definitely, uh...
a gas of some sort.

743
00:51:29,914 --> 00:51:32,792
lt's got to be the oxygen.

744
00:51:48,994 --> 00:51:51,383
Roger, Odyssey.
We copy your venting.

745
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:54,906
- Give me an alignment.
- Let's think about the kind
of things we can connect.

746
00:51:54,994 --> 00:51:57,667
- Let's start back at the beginning.
- Anything look abnormal?

747
00:52:08,874 --> 00:52:11,752
Okay, listen up. Quiet down, people.

748
00:52:12,994 --> 00:52:17,510
Quiet down. Quiet down.
Let's stay cool, people.

749
00:52:17,594 --> 00:52:20,552
Procedures, l need another
computer up in the R.T.C.C.

750
00:52:20,634 --> 00:52:23,273
l want everybody to alert
your support teams.

751
00:52:23,354 --> 00:52:25,993
Wake up anybody you need
and get them in here.

752
00:52:26,074 --> 00:52:28,224
Let's work the problem, people.

753
00:52:28,314 --> 00:52:30,669
Let's not make things worse
by guessin'.

754
00:52:30,754 --> 00:52:34,793
13, this is Houston. We are going around
the room. We're gonna get you answers.

755
00:52:34,874 --> 00:52:38,469
We keep venting, we're gonna keep
hitting the edge of that deadband.

756
00:52:38,554 --> 00:52:40,784
Take a look at the O2
on number one.

757
00:52:45,314 --> 00:52:48,192
200 pounds and falling.

758
00:52:48,274 --> 00:52:50,310
O2 tank two still zero.

759
00:52:50,394 --> 00:52:53,830
- Tank one: 218 psi and falling.
- ls that what you're gettin'? Confirm.

760
00:52:53,914 --> 00:52:58,146
- We're seeing the same, 13.
- Can we review our status, Sy?

761
00:52:58,234 --> 00:53:02,705
Let's look at this thing
from a standpoint of status.

762
00:53:04,354 --> 00:53:08,825
What have we got
on the spacecraft that's good?

763
00:53:10,314 --> 00:53:13,465
l'll get back to you, Gene.

764
00:53:15,514 --> 00:53:17,789
We're not gonna have
power much longer.

765
00:53:17,834 --> 00:53:21,031
The ship's bleedin' to death.

766
00:53:27,594 --> 00:53:30,267
- Flight?
- Yeah. Go, EECOM.

767
00:53:30,314 --> 00:53:34,227
Um, Flight, l recommend we shut down
the reactant valves of the fuel cells.

768
00:53:35,634 --> 00:53:38,910
What the hell good
is that gonna do?

769
00:53:38,994 --> 00:53:40,825
lf that's where the leak is,
we can isolate it.

770
00:53:40,914 --> 00:53:44,350
We can isolate it there,
save what's left in the tanks,
and we can run on the good cell.

771
00:53:44,434 --> 00:53:46,265
You close 'em,
you can't open 'em again.

772
00:53:46,354 --> 00:53:48,822
You can't land on the moon
with one healthy fuel cell.

773
00:53:48,874 --> 00:53:52,025
Gene, the Odyssey is dying.

774
00:53:52,074 --> 00:53:54,793
From my chair here,
this is the last option.

775
00:54:02,474 --> 00:54:05,944
Yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay, Sy.

776
00:54:18,434 --> 00:54:21,665
CAPCOM, let's have them
close the reactant valves.

777
00:54:21,754 --> 00:54:24,587
Thirteen, this is Houston.

778
00:54:24,674 --> 00:54:30,067
We want you to close react valves
on cells one and three. Do you copy?

779
00:54:30,114 --> 00:54:34,187
Are you saying you want
the whole smash?

780
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:38,187
Closing down the react valves
for fuel cells shut down?

781
00:54:38,274 --> 00:54:41,789
Shutting down the fuel cells?
Did l hear you right?

782
00:54:41,874 --> 00:54:44,593
Yeah, they heard me right.

783
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:48,223
Tell them we think that's
the only way they can stop the leak.

784
00:54:48,314 --> 00:54:52,751
Yeah, Jim. We think that closing
the react valves may stop the leak.

785
00:55:02,594 --> 00:55:05,711
- Did he copy that?
- Do you copy, Jim?

786
00:55:07,154 --> 00:55:09,622
Yes, Houston, we copy.

787
00:55:14,514 --> 00:55:18,587
We just lost the moon.

788
00:55:25,714 --> 00:55:27,784
Okay, Freddo,
shut those down.

789
00:55:29,714 --> 00:55:31,545
Let's see what this does.

790
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,944
lf this doesn't work...

791
00:55:42,034 --> 00:55:44,707
we're not gonna have enough
power left to get home.

792
00:56:01,994 --> 00:56:04,508
- Shit!
- Goddamn it!

793
00:56:04,554 --> 00:56:07,671
Houston, O2 on one is still falling.

794
00:56:09,594 --> 00:56:12,791
Freddo, how long does it take
to power up the LEM?

795
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:14,904
Three hours by the checklist.

796
00:56:14,954 --> 00:56:17,343
We don't have that much time.

797
00:56:17,434 --> 00:56:19,390
Shit!

798
00:56:19,474 --> 00:56:24,309
Okay, now, Jack, before the batteries
completely die on us in here...

799
00:56:24,354 --> 00:56:29,109
let's power down everything so we can
save as much as we can for reentry.

800
00:56:29,154 --> 00:56:32,624
Fifteen minutes of oxygen and that's it.
The command module will be dead.

801
00:56:32,674 --> 00:56:35,666
Okay. Okay, guys, listen up.
Here's the drill.

802
00:56:35,714 --> 00:56:38,069
We're moving the astronauts
over to the LEM.

803
00:56:38,114 --> 00:56:39,991
We've got to get some oxygen up there.

804
00:56:40,034 --> 00:56:43,344
TELMU, Control, l want emergency power
procedure; essential hardware only.

805
00:56:43,394 --> 00:56:47,512
GNC, EECOM, we're gonna be shutting down
the command module at the same time.

806
00:56:47,554 --> 00:56:50,068
We'll have to transfer the guidance
system from one computer to the other...

807
00:56:50,114 --> 00:56:52,867
so l want those numbers up and ready
when our guys are in position.

808
00:56:52,954 --> 00:56:55,184
We've gotta transfer all control
data over the LEM computer...

809
00:56:55,234 --> 00:56:57,111
before the command module dies.

810
00:56:57,154 --> 00:56:59,065
The lunar module
just became a lifeboat.

811
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:03,348
Odyssey, this is Houston.
We need you to power down immediately.

812
00:57:03,394 --> 00:57:06,591
You're gonna have to power up
the LEM at the same time, so you
better get somebody over there.

813
00:57:06,674 --> 00:57:09,427
We already have Freddo
in the LEM, Houston.

814
00:57:09,474 --> 00:57:11,829
We've got serious time pressure.

815
00:57:11,874 --> 00:57:14,229
You've got to get
the guidance program transferred,

816
00:57:14,274 --> 00:57:16,788
and you've got to do it before you're
out of power in the command module...

817
00:57:16,834 --> 00:57:19,189
or you're not gonna be able
to navigate up there.

818
00:57:19,234 --> 00:57:21,145
How much time?
Can you give me a number?

819
00:57:21,234 --> 00:57:25,147
Well, we're looking at less than 15
minutes of life support in the Odyssey.

820
00:57:27,314 --> 00:57:32,786
We've got 15 minutes, Freddo.
lt's worse than l thought.

821
00:57:32,834 --> 00:57:36,713
Houston, be aware l've moved
from the command module into the LEM.

822
00:57:38,714 --> 00:57:42,070
lf Jack can't get that guidance computer
data transferred before they go dead--

823
00:57:42,114 --> 00:57:44,469
- They won't even know
which way they're pointed.
- That's right.

824
00:57:44,514 --> 00:57:47,108
- That's a bad way to fly.
- l'll be in 210 if you need me.

825
00:57:49,114 --> 00:57:52,823
Houston, this is Thirteen.
Are you back with me now?

826
00:57:52,874 --> 00:57:57,425
Aquarius, this is Houston. You now have
about 12 minutes to power up.

827
00:57:57,474 --> 00:58:01,513
l can't see any stars. Man, there's a
lot of debris floatin' around out there.

828
00:58:01,594 --> 00:58:05,507
Okay, Houston, l have completed
the steps on page 15.

829
00:58:05,594 --> 00:58:07,425
Now l'm ready
to power down the computer.

830
00:58:07,514 --> 00:58:10,745
l'm gonna need
your gimbal angles, Jack...

831
00:58:10,834 --> 00:58:14,907
- before you shut down the computer!
- Okay, Jim.

832
00:58:14,954 --> 00:58:17,024
l need this back to me
before they power down.

833
00:58:17,114 --> 00:58:19,025
All right, all right.
l got it. Hold on.

834
00:58:19,074 --> 00:58:23,750
- Houston, our computer is up.
- Roger. Stand by.

835
00:58:23,834 --> 00:58:28,225
Jack, we need to proceed with
steps 12 through 17 quickly.

836
00:58:28,314 --> 00:58:32,671
You're down to about
eight minutes remaining.

837
00:58:32,714 --> 00:58:34,944
Fuel cell pump's off.
O2 fans, tank two off.

838
00:58:35,034 --> 00:58:38,788
Okay, Houston, check me. l have
completed these gimbal conversions...

839
00:58:38,874 --> 00:58:42,310
but l need a double check
of the arithmetic.

840
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:46,592
- Yeah, you can go, Jim.
- The roll CAL angle is minus two.

841
00:58:46,634 --> 00:58:49,990
Lunar module roll is 355.57.

842
00:58:50,074 --> 00:58:55,671
Pitch: 1678-- Correction.
Pitch: 167.78.

843
00:58:55,714 --> 00:59:00,504
- Yaw is 351.87.
- Stand by. We're checking it.

844
00:59:00,554 --> 00:59:02,909
We've got negative visibility
in our star field,

845
00:59:02,954 --> 00:59:07,869
and if this paperwork isn't right,
who knows where we'll end up out here?

846
00:59:13,834 --> 00:59:15,711
Looks good, Flight.

847
00:59:15,754 --> 00:59:17,745
- lt's all right.
- Good here.

848
00:59:17,794 --> 00:59:20,149
- He's good, Andy.
- We'll go on those numbers.

849
00:59:20,194 --> 00:59:22,105
- You're good.
- Log them in, Freddo.

850
00:59:22,154 --> 00:59:24,509
Jack, turn off the l.M.U.
Switch to S.C.S.

851
00:59:24,554 --> 00:59:26,909
Stand by to turn off
the thrusters. Over.

852
00:59:27,354 --> 00:59:30,426
lt's a great day in New York.
lt's girl watchers' weather.

853
00:59:30,514 --> 00:59:32,982
l like those ingenious girl watchers
who put on Con Edison helmets...

854
00:59:33,034 --> 00:59:36,947
and dig trenches in the street
to get a better view.

855
00:59:37,034 --> 00:59:39,229
But l-- Hey, speaking
of girl watching,

856
00:59:39,274 --> 00:59:43,108
did you know that our first bachelor
astronaut is on his way to the moon?

857
00:59:43,194 --> 00:59:45,150
ls it Swigert?
Yeah, first bachelor.

858
00:59:45,194 --> 00:59:49,312
He's the kind, they say, has a girl
in every port. He has that reputation.

859
00:59:49,354 --> 00:59:53,552
He's sort of foolishly optimistic,
taking nylons, Hershey bars to the moon.

860
00:59:56,274 --> 00:59:58,105
Did you read
that three million--

861
00:59:58,194 --> 01:00:01,311
What do you say?
Less viewers or fewer viewers?

862
01:00:01,354 --> 01:00:06,189
Three million fewer viewers, uh, watched
the space shot than did the last one.

863
01:00:06,274 --> 01:00:08,913
Uh, l--
Colonel Borman is h--

864
01:00:08,994 --> 01:00:11,383
An ABC New--

865
01:00:11,474 --> 01:00:14,989
Here is ABC science editor
Jules Bergman.

866
01:00:15,074 --> 01:00:18,510
The Apollo 13 spacecraft
has lost all electrical power,

867
01:00:18,594 --> 01:00:21,062
and astronauts Jim Lovell,
Fred Haise and Jack Swigert...

868
01:00:21,154 --> 01:00:23,509
are making their way through
the tunnel to the lunar module,

869
01:00:23,554 --> 01:00:25,067
using it as a lifeboat,

870
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:28,112
so they'll have electrical power
for their radios on the command module.

871
01:00:28,194 --> 01:00:31,345
Apollo 13 is apparently
also losing breathing oxygen--

872
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:34,386
Slow down. An electrical failure.
What exactly does that mean?

873
01:00:34,434 --> 01:00:37,312
The emergency has ruled out
any chance of a lunar landing...

874
01:00:37,394 --> 01:00:39,954
and could endanger the lives
of the astronauts themselves...

875
01:00:40,034 --> 01:00:43,947
if the LEM oxygen supply, plus whatever
is left of the command module's oxygen,

876
01:00:44,034 --> 01:00:46,594
can't last them until
they can get back to Earth.

877
01:00:46,674 --> 01:00:48,585
What do you mean there's
no immediate danger?

878
01:00:48,674 --> 01:00:51,029
l just heard they're losing oxygen.
Can they get back?

879
01:00:51,074 --> 01:00:54,703
The LEM's descent rocket engine
will be used in aborting the mission...

880
01:00:54,754 --> 01:00:56,824
and getting the astronauts
safely back to Earth.

881
01:00:56,914 --> 01:01:01,465
Recapping what has happened: The Apollo
13 astronauts may be in grave danger.

882
01:01:01,514 --> 01:01:03,391
No, don't give me
that NASA bullshit!

883
01:01:03,434 --> 01:01:05,504
l want to know what's
happening with my husband!

884
01:01:05,754 --> 01:01:07,824
We want to switch control
to the Aquarius now.

885
01:01:07,874 --> 01:01:09,512
- Roger that.
- Houston, wait!

886
01:01:09,594 --> 01:01:12,347
You're down to
about five minutes now, Jack.

887
01:01:12,434 --> 01:01:17,462
Be aware our R.C.S. isn't up here yet.
We have no attitude control on Aquarius.

888
01:01:17,514 --> 01:01:20,665
They don't have control?
Did we miss a step here?

889
01:01:20,754 --> 01:01:23,552
- Control, what the hell happened?
- What? l don't know.

890
01:01:27,954 --> 01:01:32,152
We're out of whack. l'm trying to pitch
down, but we're yawing to the left.

891
01:01:32,194 --> 01:01:34,071
Why can't l null this out?

892
01:01:34,114 --> 01:01:36,833
She wasn't designed to fly
attached like this.

893
01:01:36,874 --> 01:01:40,549
lt's like flying with
a dead elephant on our back.

894
01:01:40,634 --> 01:01:43,387
Flight, Guidance. We're getting
awfully close to center here.

895
01:01:43,474 --> 01:01:47,069
Watch that middle gimbal. We don't
want you tumbling off into space.

896
01:01:47,114 --> 01:01:49,753
Freddo, inform Houston l'm well aware
of the goddamn gimbals!

897
01:01:49,794 --> 01:01:51,705
Roger that, Houston.

898
01:01:51,754 --> 01:01:53,631
l don't need to hear the obvious.

899
01:01:53,674 --> 01:01:55,665
- l've got the frappin' eight-ball
in front of me!
- Andy, we're on VOX.

900
01:01:55,714 --> 01:01:58,547
Aquarius, this is Houston.
We've got you both on VOX.

901
01:01:58,594 --> 01:02:01,028
You want what?
You want us to go to VOX?

902
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:04,072
You have a hot mike.
We are reading everything you say.

903
01:02:04,154 --> 01:02:05,985
Sorry, Jim.

904
01:02:07,674 --> 01:02:09,426
lt's only
by a very narrow margin...

905
01:02:09,474 --> 01:02:13,467
that we're going to get Lovell,
Haise and Swigert back alive.

906
01:02:13,514 --> 01:02:16,153
Marilyn?

907
01:02:16,194 --> 01:02:18,947
l'm sorry.
Jeffrey's calling for you.

908
01:02:19,034 --> 01:02:22,868
...the terseness of Kraft and
the grim lines of Jim McDivitt.

909
01:02:22,914 --> 01:02:27,430
This has been a very close call.
We're not out of the woods yet.

910
01:02:31,074 --> 01:02:33,429
Jeffrey?

911
01:02:33,474 --> 01:02:36,705
Why are so many people here?

912
01:02:36,794 --> 01:02:42,391
Oh, well, you know...
your dad's flying his mission.

913
01:02:44,354 --> 01:02:47,346
He said he was going
to get me a moon rock.

914
01:02:47,394 --> 01:02:50,147
Right.

915
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:53,510
Well...

916
01:02:53,594 --> 01:02:58,622
something broke
on your daddy's spaceship,

917
01:02:58,714 --> 01:03:04,072
and he's gonna have to turn around
before he even gets to the moon.

918
01:03:06,874 --> 01:03:10,310
Was it the door?

919
01:03:10,554 --> 01:03:13,193
Thirteen, Houston. We still show
that venting pushing you around.

920
01:03:13,274 --> 01:03:16,186
- How you doing?
- Houston, Aquarius.

921
01:03:16,274 --> 01:03:20,984
We've had to learn how to fly all over
again, but we are doing better now.

922
01:03:21,034 --> 01:03:24,947
- Uh, roger that, Aquarius.
- Have him close it out.

923
01:03:24,994 --> 01:03:28,384
Jack, we can close out
your procedure now.

924
01:03:28,474 --> 01:03:33,343
Do we know for sure that we can
power this thing back up?

925
01:03:33,434 --> 01:03:36,153
lt's gonna get
awfully cold in here.

926
01:03:36,194 --> 01:03:40,870
Copy that, Jack.
We'll just have to deal with that later.

927
01:03:43,634 --> 01:03:44,987
- Computer off.
- We're clear.

928
01:03:45,074 --> 01:03:47,030
We're going to the LEM.

929
01:03:48,714 --> 01:03:52,502
We confirm shutdown, Jack.
Lunar module now in control.

930
01:03:56,834 --> 01:04:02,113
Roger that, Houston.
This is Odyssey signing off.

931
01:04:17,234 --> 01:04:20,226
Freddo, we're gonna have
to execute some sort of burn.

932
01:04:20,314 --> 01:04:22,748
lt's just a matter of when.

933
01:04:25,794 --> 01:04:29,582
- Did they shut us all down in there?
- Yeah.

934
01:04:29,634 --> 01:04:32,865
Didn't think we'd
be back in here so soon.

935
01:04:32,954 --> 01:04:36,867
Houston, how far off course
do you project we are?

936
01:04:36,954 --> 01:04:38,785
Over.

937
01:04:41,154 --> 01:04:42,985
Okay, people, listen up!

938
01:04:43,074 --> 01:04:46,783
Gentlemen, l want you all
to forget the flight plan.

939
01:04:46,874 --> 01:04:50,662
From this moment on, we are
improvising a new mission.

940
01:04:50,754 --> 01:04:54,463
Sorry about that.

941
01:04:54,554 --> 01:04:56,545
- We'll get somebody to look at that.
- Find a bulb around here.

942
01:04:56,634 --> 01:05:00,263
How do we get our people home?

943
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:02,185
They are here.

944
01:05:02,274 --> 01:05:04,583
- Do we turn 'em around,
straight back, direct abort?
- Yes!

945
01:05:04,674 --> 01:05:06,551
- Gene--
- l can't guarantee the burn yet.

946
01:05:06,594 --> 01:05:09,711
No, sir, no, sir, no, sir!

947
01:05:09,794 --> 01:05:11,785
We get them on
a free-return trajectory.

948
01:05:11,874 --> 01:05:14,308
lt's the option with the fewest
question marks for safety.

949
01:05:14,394 --> 01:05:18,433
l agree with Jerry. We use the moon's
gravity to slingshot them around.

950
01:05:18,514 --> 01:05:21,631
- The LEM will not support three
guys for that amount of time.
- lt barely holds two.

951
01:05:21,714 --> 01:05:25,423
We've got to do a direct abort. We do an
about-face, bring the guys right home.

952
01:05:25,474 --> 01:05:27,544
Get 'em back soon.
Absolutely.

953
01:05:27,594 --> 01:05:29,471
We don't even know if
the Odyssey's engine's working.

954
01:05:29,554 --> 01:05:31,385
lf there's been serious damage
to this spacecraft--

955
01:05:31,474 --> 01:05:33,305
They blow up and they die!

956
01:05:33,394 --> 01:05:35,305
- That is not the argument!
We are talking about time!
- Jesus! Come on!

957
01:05:35,394 --> 01:05:38,386
l'm not gonna sugarcoat this for you!

958
01:05:38,434 --> 01:05:41,187
Okay, hold it.
Let's hold it down.

959
01:05:41,274 --> 01:05:44,346
Let's hold it down. The only engine
with enough power for a direct abort...

960
01:05:44,434 --> 01:05:46,743
is the S.P.S.
on the service module.

961
01:05:46,834 --> 01:05:48,984
From what Lovell has told us, it could
have been damaged in an explosion,

962
01:05:49,074 --> 01:05:50,905
so let's consider
that engine dead.

963
01:05:50,994 --> 01:05:52,825
We light that thing up,
could blow the whole works.

964
01:05:52,914 --> 01:05:55,348
lt's just too risky.
We're not gonna take that chance.

965
01:05:55,394 --> 01:05:57,749
About the only thing the command
module is good for is reentry.

966
01:05:57,794 --> 01:06:01,343
That leaves us with the LEM,
which means free-return trajectory.

967
01:06:01,434 --> 01:06:04,107
Once we get
the guys around the moon,

968
01:06:04,194 --> 01:06:06,424
we'll fire up the LEM engine,
make a long burn,

969
01:06:06,514 --> 01:06:08,869
pick up some speed
and get 'em home as quick as we can.

970
01:06:08,954 --> 01:06:12,503
Gene, l'm wondering what
the Grumman guys think about this.

971
01:06:12,594 --> 01:06:16,792
We can't make any guarantees.
We designed the LEM to land on the moon,

972
01:06:16,834 --> 01:06:19,064
not fire the engine out there
for course corrections.

973
01:06:19,154 --> 01:06:23,033
Well, unfortunately, we're not
landing on the moon, are we?

974
01:06:23,074 --> 01:06:27,909
l don't care what anything was designed
to do. l care about what it can do.

975
01:06:28,434 --> 01:06:32,029
Let's get to work.
Let's lay it out, okay?

976
01:06:32,754 --> 01:06:35,552
CAPCOM. Flight, he says
it will be ready in time.

977
01:06:35,634 --> 01:06:39,547
After this burn, we've got to build
some time in the flight plan for sleep.

978
01:06:39,634 --> 01:06:42,910
- Run it by the F.A.O.
- l've run it by the F.A.O.

979
01:06:42,994 --> 01:06:44,825
Do we know how long
we're gonna fire that burn?

980
01:06:44,914 --> 01:06:48,031
- He specifically wanted
a quote from a flight director.
- Who wanted a quote?

981
01:06:48,114 --> 01:06:50,105
- The President.
- The President?

982
01:06:50,194 --> 01:06:52,662
Nixon. He wants odds.

983
01:06:52,754 --> 01:06:54,904
We are not losing the crew.

984
01:06:54,994 --> 01:06:57,792
l gotta give him odds.
Five to one against?

985
01:06:57,874 --> 01:06:59,705
- Three to one?
- l don't think they're that good.

986
01:06:59,794 --> 01:07:02,706
We are not
losing those men!

987
01:07:06,234 --> 01:07:09,306
How long are they
gonna have to burn the engine?

988
01:07:09,394 --> 01:07:12,750
Look, tell him...
three to one.

989
01:07:15,154 --> 01:07:17,952
Expect loss of signal
in less than one minute.

990
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:21,470
When we pick you back up we will
have your P.C. plus two burn data.

991
01:07:21,554 --> 01:07:26,264
Roger that, Houston. We'll hear
from you again at acquisition of signal.

992
01:07:27,954 --> 01:07:29,785
You wanna look?

993
01:07:31,074 --> 01:07:35,192
Oh, look at that.

994
01:07:35,234 --> 01:07:37,111
Wow.

995
01:07:40,914 --> 01:07:46,068
Aquarius, that's 30 seconds
until loss of signal.

996
01:07:48,354 --> 01:07:52,188
Mare Tranquillitatis.

997
01:07:52,234 --> 01:07:55,351
Neil and Buzz's old neighborhood.

998
01:07:55,394 --> 01:07:57,589
Comin' up on Mount Marilyn.

999
01:07:57,634 --> 01:08:01,422
Jim, you gotta
take a look at this.

1000
01:08:01,474 --> 01:08:03,704
l've seen it.

1001
01:08:08,994 --> 01:08:10,871
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1002
01:08:10,914 --> 01:08:15,669
We expect loss of signal
in approximately ten seconds.

1003
01:08:15,714 --> 01:08:18,751
So long, Earth.
Catch you on the flip side.

1004
01:08:25,314 --> 01:08:28,465
When you go
into the shadow of the moon...

1005
01:08:28,514 --> 01:08:30,869
and the moon is
between you and the sun,

1006
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:34,463
you see stars that are more brilliant
than anything you've ever seen...

1007
01:08:34,554 --> 01:08:36,545
on the clearest nights
here on Earth.

1008
01:08:36,634 --> 01:08:41,992
And then you pass into the lunar sunrise
over the lunar surface.

1009
01:08:42,074 --> 01:08:44,224
lt must be an awe-inspiring sight.

1010
01:08:44,314 --> 01:08:46,908
l-l-l can't wait to see it myself.

1011
01:08:46,994 --> 01:08:51,112
The problem now is not so much
a question of an adequate oxygen supply,

1012
01:08:51,194 --> 01:08:53,105
but it is the rate
of consumption of water,

1013
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:56,226
which is vitally needed
for the cooling operations...

1014
01:08:56,314 --> 01:08:58,669
to maintain the electronic systems
and so forth.

1015
01:09:35,114 --> 01:09:38,265
Look, it's Fra Mauro.

1016
01:09:38,314 --> 01:09:40,953
l can see our landing site.

1017
01:09:42,634 --> 01:09:44,545
Wow.

1018
01:09:44,634 --> 01:09:48,707
Look at the Tsiolkovskii crater.

1019
01:09:48,794 --> 01:09:52,992
l can't believe how bright
the ejecta blanket is.

1020
01:09:53,034 --> 01:09:56,504
lt's like snow. lt's beautiful.

1021
01:09:56,554 --> 01:09:59,591
That's Mare lmbrium to the north.

1022
01:11:00,194 --> 01:11:02,071
Thirteen, this is Houston.

1023
01:11:02,114 --> 01:11:05,948
We're reading your telemetry.
lt's good to see you again.

1024
01:11:06,034 --> 01:11:08,389
Good to see you too, Houston.

1025
01:11:08,474 --> 01:11:11,910
We are picking you up at a velocity
of 7,062 feet per second...

1026
01:11:11,994 --> 01:11:16,112
at a distance from the moon
of 56 nautical miles.

1027
01:11:16,194 --> 01:11:19,266
Stand by for your
P.C. plus two burn data.

1028
01:11:19,354 --> 01:11:24,553
l had an itch to take this baby down,
do some prospectin'.

1029
01:11:24,634 --> 01:11:27,865
Damn, we were close.

1030
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:32,512
Gentlemen,
what are your intentions?

1031
01:11:35,794 --> 01:11:38,103
l'd like to go home.

1032
01:11:40,114 --> 01:11:42,423
We got a burn coming up.

1033
01:11:42,514 --> 01:11:45,312
We're gonna need a contingency
if we lose comm with Houston.

1034
01:11:45,394 --> 01:11:49,751
Freddo, let's get an idea where
we stand on the consumables.

1035
01:11:49,794 --> 01:11:51,671
Jack, get into the Odyssey...

1036
01:11:51,714 --> 01:11:54,831
and bag up all the water you can
before it freezes in there.

1037
01:11:57,914 --> 01:11:59,745
Let's go home.

1038
01:11:59,834 --> 01:12:02,951
Aquarius, we got some P.C.
plus two burn data for you fellas.

1039
01:12:03,474 --> 01:12:08,184
So you're telling me you can
only give our guys 45 hours?

1040
01:12:08,234 --> 01:12:12,022
That brings them to about there.

1041
01:12:14,674 --> 01:12:16,665
Gentlemen, that's not acceptable.

1042
01:12:16,714 --> 01:12:20,024
Gene, Gene, we've got
to talk about power.

1043
01:12:20,114 --> 01:12:23,026
Whoa, whoa, guys!
Power is everything!

1044
01:12:23,074 --> 01:12:25,429
- Power is everything.
- What do you mean?

1045
01:12:25,474 --> 01:12:28,466
Without it, they don't talk to us,
they don't correct their trajectory,

1046
01:12:28,514 --> 01:12:30,391
they don't turn
the heat shield around.

1047
01:12:30,434 --> 01:12:35,064
We gotta turn everything off, now.
They're not gonna make it to reentry.

1048
01:12:35,114 --> 01:12:38,424
- What do you mean, "everything"?
- With everything on,
the LEM draws 60 amps.

1049
01:12:38,514 --> 01:12:42,712
At that rate, in 16 hours
the batteries are dead, not 45.

1050
01:12:42,754 --> 01:12:45,143
And so is the crew.
We gotta get them down to 12 amps.

1051
01:12:45,234 --> 01:12:47,111
- Twelve amps?
- How many?

1052
01:12:47,194 --> 01:12:49,424
You can't run a vacuum cleaner
on 12 amps, John.

1053
01:12:49,474 --> 01:12:52,944
We gotta turn off-- We have to
turn off the radars, cabin heater,

1054
01:12:52,994 --> 01:12:55,189
instrument displays,
the guidance computer, the whole smash.

1055
01:12:55,234 --> 01:12:57,907
Whoa! Guidance computer.
What if they need to do another burn?

1056
01:12:57,954 --> 01:13:00,468
They won't even know
which way they're pointed.

1057
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:03,187
The more time we talk,
the more juice they waste.

1058
01:13:03,234 --> 01:13:05,907
- That's the deal?
- That's the deal.

1059
01:13:10,274 --> 01:13:15,064
Okay, John. The minute we finish
the burn, we'll power down the LEM.

1060
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:17,110
All right.

1061
01:13:17,154 --> 01:13:21,352
Now in the meantime, we're gonna have
a frozen command module up there.

1062
01:13:21,434 --> 01:13:24,551
We're gonna have to power it up using
nothing but the reentry batteries.

1063
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:28,309
- That's never been tried.
- We've never even simulated it before.

1064
01:13:28,354 --> 01:13:30,470
Well, we're gonna
have to figure it out.

1065
01:13:30,554 --> 01:13:34,103
l want people in our simulators
working reentry scenarios.

1066
01:13:34,194 --> 01:13:37,823
l want you to find every engineer who
designed every switch, every circuit,

1067
01:13:37,914 --> 01:13:39,711
and every light bulb
that's up there.

1068
01:13:39,794 --> 01:13:43,025
Then talk to the guy in the assembly
line who actually built the thing.

1069
01:13:43,074 --> 01:13:46,623
Find out how to squeeze every amp
out of both of these goddamn machines.

1070
01:13:46,714 --> 01:13:51,742
l want this mark all the way
back to Earth with time to spare.

1071
01:13:51,834 --> 01:13:53,665
We never lost
an American in space.

1072
01:13:53,754 --> 01:13:56,063
We're sure as hell not
gonna lose one on my watch.

1073
01:13:56,154 --> 01:13:57,985
Failure is not an option.

1074
01:14:03,514 --> 01:14:05,345
Ken?

1075
01:14:05,434 --> 01:14:06,583
Ken?

1076
01:14:06,674 --> 01:14:09,472
- What? Huh?
- Good, you're not dead.

1077
01:14:09,554 --> 01:14:12,227
l've been trying to get in touch
with you for 45 minutes.

1078
01:14:12,314 --> 01:14:14,225
Jesus, John,
what are you doing here?

1079
01:14:14,314 --> 01:14:16,145
l gotta get you in the simulators.
We got a ship to land.

1080
01:14:16,234 --> 01:14:18,384
- What?
- There's been an explosion.

1081
01:14:18,434 --> 01:14:21,585
Oxygen tanks are gone. Two fuel cells
gone. Command module shut down.

1082
01:14:21,674 --> 01:14:24,472
- What about the crew?
- Crew's fine so far.

1083
01:14:24,554 --> 01:14:26,545
Trying to keep them
alive in the LEM.

1084
01:14:26,634 --> 01:14:29,432
We're gonna have to shut
that down pretty soon too.

1085
01:14:29,514 --> 01:14:32,472
We got a lot of people working
the numbers on this one, Ken.

1086
01:14:32,554 --> 01:14:35,193
Nobody's too sure how much power
we're gonna have when we hit reentry.

1087
01:14:35,274 --> 01:14:38,072
The command module's gonna be
frozen up pretty good by then.

1088
01:14:38,154 --> 01:14:42,705
You see this ammeter rise over 20
at any point, power-up is no good.

1089
01:14:42,794 --> 01:14:44,944
We see it spike, that's sayonara
for the guidance computer.

1090
01:14:45,034 --> 01:14:47,025
Our guys can't reenter. Okay?

1091
01:14:47,114 --> 01:14:48,945
How much power do we have
to play with?

1092
01:14:49,034 --> 01:14:51,184
Barely enough to run this
coffee pot for nine hours.

1093
01:14:51,274 --> 01:14:53,424
- Go.
- Yeah, Ken Mattingly just got here.

1094
01:14:53,514 --> 01:14:56,074
Copy. He's here.

1095
01:14:56,154 --> 01:14:58,224
They've been losing heat
since the accident.

1096
01:14:58,314 --> 01:15:00,953
They're gonna start getting water
condensation on the control panels.

1097
01:15:00,994 --> 01:15:04,145
- Ken, glad you're here.
You know what's going on?
- John's brought me up to speed.

1098
01:15:04,234 --> 01:15:06,384
- What do we have left in the batteries?
- We don't really know.

1099
01:15:06,474 --> 01:15:08,624
We gotta get started on
some shortcuts for power-up.

1100
01:15:08,714 --> 01:15:10,067
You know how short?

1101
01:15:10,154 --> 01:15:13,749
lt's all in the sequencing. lf we can
skip whatever we don't absolutely need,

1102
01:15:13,834 --> 01:15:16,587
- turn things on in the right order--
- l agree.

1103
01:15:16,634 --> 01:15:19,944
- You started on a procedure?
- The engineers have tried,
but it's your ship.

1104
01:15:19,994 --> 01:15:22,747
- We gotta get you in there.
- Okay.

1105
01:15:22,834 --> 01:15:25,394
Frank, l need the sim
cold and dark.

1106
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:27,789
Give me the exact same conditions
they've got in there now.

1107
01:15:27,834 --> 01:15:30,348
- l need present status
of every instrument.
- You got it.

1108
01:15:30,394 --> 01:15:33,545
l need a flashlight.
That's not what they have up there.

1109
01:15:33,594 --> 01:15:35,630
Don't give me anything
they don't have on board.

1110
01:15:35,674 --> 01:15:37,904
Let's get this show on the road.
Put him in space, fellas.

1111
01:15:39,994 --> 01:15:42,827
Okay, Houston, the quad heater
circuit breakers are open.

1112
01:15:42,874 --> 01:15:44,751
Copy that.

1113
01:15:44,794 --> 01:15:47,467
We're using the forward omni
when the earth's in the window,

1114
01:15:47,514 --> 01:15:50,187
and we're switching to aft omni
when we see the moon.

1115
01:15:50,234 --> 01:15:52,111
We copy that, Thirteen.

1116
01:15:52,154 --> 01:15:54,668
Aquarius, we don't want you
to make any more waste dumps.

1117
01:15:54,714 --> 01:15:57,387
The venting may
push you off course.

1118
01:15:57,434 --> 01:16:00,426
- Oh, Christ.
- What's up?

1119
01:16:00,474 --> 01:16:04,592
No more waste dumps.
We're just gonna have to store it.

1120
01:16:04,634 --> 01:16:06,545
Jack, we're gonna need
some more urine bags.

1121
01:16:06,594 --> 01:16:11,031
Okay, Houston, that leaves us
with just the computer,

1122
01:16:11,074 --> 01:16:15,704
which l'm shutting down now.

1123
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:22,191
And that's it.

1124
01:16:22,234 --> 01:16:25,306
We just put Sir lsaac Newton
in the driver's seat.

1125
01:16:30,394 --> 01:16:32,589
ls it A.M. or P.M.?

1126
01:16:32,634 --> 01:16:35,944
A.M. Very, very A.M.

1127
01:16:35,994 --> 01:16:38,508
Haise is running a temperature,
and none of them has slept.

1128
01:16:38,554 --> 01:16:41,830
l can't order these guys to go to sleep.
Could you sleep up there?

1129
01:16:41,914 --> 01:16:44,030
lt's gonna get awful cold
in there for those guys.

1130
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:49,873
Gene, we have a situation
brewing with the carbon dioxide.

1131
01:16:49,914 --> 01:16:52,189
We got a CO2 filter problem
on the lunar module.

1132
01:16:52,274 --> 01:16:55,630
- Five filters on the LEM.
- Meant for 2 guys for a day and a half.

1133
01:16:55,674 --> 01:16:58,029
- l told the doc--
- They're already up to 8 on the gauges.

1134
01:16:58,074 --> 01:17:01,146
Anything over 15 and you get
impaired judgment, blackouts,

1135
01:17:01,234 --> 01:17:04,544
- beginnings of brain asphyxia.
- What about the scrubbers
on the command module?

1136
01:17:04,634 --> 01:17:06,864
- They take square cartridges.
- The ones on the LEM are round.

1137
01:17:08,954 --> 01:17:11,593
Tell me this isn't
a government operation.

1138
01:17:11,674 --> 01:17:14,234
This just isn't a contingency
we've remotely looked at.

1139
01:17:14,274 --> 01:17:16,344
Those CO2 levels
are gonna be getting toxic.

1140
01:17:16,434 --> 01:17:21,462
l suggest you invent a way to put
a square peg in a round hole rapidly.

1141
01:17:24,114 --> 01:17:27,231
Okay, people, listen up.

1142
01:17:27,314 --> 01:17:31,227
The people upstairs have handed us
this one, and we gotta come through.

1143
01:17:31,314 --> 01:17:35,227
We gotta find a way
to make this...

1144
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:37,953
fit into the hole for this...

1145
01:17:38,034 --> 01:17:40,502
using nothing but that.

1146
01:17:41,994 --> 01:17:44,508
- Let's get it organized.
- Okay, let's build a filter.

1147
01:17:44,594 --> 01:17:47,506
Better get some coffee
going too, someone.

1148
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:50,264
The Haise family
lives in El Lago, Texas.

1149
01:17:50,354 --> 01:17:52,993
His wife, Mary,
is from Biloxi, Mississippi.

1150
01:17:53,074 --> 01:17:54,905
When Fred Haise
was growing up in Biloxi,

1151
01:17:54,994 --> 01:17:56,985
he may have looked
ahead to a fine family,

1152
01:17:57,074 --> 01:17:58,905
but he never dreamt of flying.

1153
01:17:58,994 --> 01:18:01,303
l'd never flown really
before l went into the service,

1154
01:18:01,394 --> 01:18:05,512
and l only went into the flying business
as a means to getting a commission.

1155
01:18:05,594 --> 01:18:08,472
- Good morning.
- Henry. Don't you ever sleep?

1156
01:18:08,514 --> 01:18:12,473
- l have a request from the news people.
- Uh-huh.

1157
01:18:12,554 --> 01:18:15,022
They want to put
a transmitter up on the lawn.

1158
01:18:16,994 --> 01:18:18,871
Transmitter?

1159
01:18:18,914 --> 01:18:21,428
lt's kind of a tower
for a live broadcast.

1160
01:18:26,114 --> 01:18:30,630
They didn't care about this mission.
They didn't even run Jim's show.

1161
01:18:30,714 --> 01:18:34,946
Well... it's more dramatic now.
Suddenly people are--

1162
01:18:35,034 --> 01:18:38,390
Landing on the moon
wasn't dramatic enough for them.
Why should not landing be?

1163
01:18:38,434 --> 01:18:42,552
Look, l, um, realize
how hard this is, Marilyn,

1164
01:18:42,594 --> 01:18:44,630
but the whole world
is caught up in it.

1165
01:18:44,674 --> 01:18:47,268
- lt's the biggest story since--
- No, Henry.

1166
01:18:47,354 --> 01:18:51,984
Those people don't put one piece
of equipment on my lawn.

1167
01:18:52,034 --> 01:18:55,663
lf they have a problem with that,
they can take it up with my husband.

1168
01:18:55,714 --> 01:18:58,069
He'll be home on Friday.

1169
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:08,710
When you are sad and lonely

1170
01:19:08,794 --> 01:19:12,230
And have no place to go

1171
01:19:12,314 --> 01:19:17,513
Come to see me, baby
and bring along some dough

1172
01:19:17,594 --> 01:19:22,907
And we'll go honky tonkin'
Honky tonkin'

1173
01:19:22,994 --> 01:19:27,112
Honky tonkin', honey baby

1174
01:19:27,194 --> 01:19:32,222
We'll go honky tonkin'
'round this town

1175
01:19:39,994 --> 01:19:41,825
Hey, Freddo.

1176
01:19:41,914 --> 01:19:45,793
lt's too cold in there.

1177
01:19:45,874 --> 01:19:48,866
Yeah.

1178
01:19:58,194 --> 01:20:00,708
That's a nice one of Mary.

1179
01:20:03,434 --> 01:20:06,585
- You don't look too good, Freddo.
- l'll survive.

1180
01:20:06,674 --> 01:20:09,427
- There's aspirin in the medical kit.
- l took some.

1181
01:20:09,514 --> 01:20:11,664
Jim, l'm all right.

1182
01:20:16,074 --> 01:20:19,987
lt was an accident,
Mary gettin' pregnant.

1183
01:20:20,074 --> 01:20:24,943
You should have seen the look
on my face when she told me.

1184
01:20:25,034 --> 01:20:27,992
Well, that has
a tendency to happen.

1185
01:20:28,034 --> 01:20:31,026
Yeah.

1186
01:20:35,434 --> 01:20:37,470
l wonder if it's
a boy or a girl.

1187
01:20:39,474 --> 01:20:41,351
You're gonna find out
soon enough.

1188
01:20:41,434 --> 01:20:44,153
Sure.

1189
01:20:47,114 --> 01:20:50,231
l never dreamed l'd ever get
to do something like this:

1190
01:20:50,274 --> 01:20:52,708
come up here on a real mission.

1191
01:20:52,794 --> 01:20:56,309
Most of the guys
l graduated high school with...

1192
01:20:56,394 --> 01:20:58,783
never even left home,
and here l am.

1193
01:20:58,874 --> 01:21:03,868
Oh, yeah... here you are.

1194
01:21:07,034 --> 01:21:09,594
lt hurts when l urinate.

1195
01:21:09,674 --> 01:21:12,632
Well, you're not
gettin' enough water.

1196
01:21:12,714 --> 01:21:17,390
l'm drinking my ration
the same as you.

1197
01:21:17,434 --> 01:21:21,552
l think old Swigert
gave me the clap.

1198
01:21:21,594 --> 01:21:26,349
He's been pissin' in my relief tube.

1199
01:21:26,394 --> 01:21:31,149
Well... that will be a hot one at
the debriefing for the flight surgeon.

1200
01:21:31,194 --> 01:21:36,746
That's another first
for America's space program.

1201
01:21:36,794 --> 01:21:38,352
Listen, um... l've been
going... over some stuff,

1202
01:21:42,274 --> 01:21:47,826
and l'm a little worried about this cold
affecting our battery efficiency.

1203
01:21:47,914 --> 01:21:51,953
We quit heatin' the glycol to save
water and power, so that's not helping.

1204
01:21:51,994 --> 01:21:53,871
lt could cost us
amp hours on the back end?

1205
01:21:53,914 --> 01:21:56,633
-That's a possibility.
-l've been goin' over the numbers again.

1206
01:21:56,714 --> 01:21:59,672
Have they called up
with a reentry plan yet?

1207
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,274
- We're comin' in too shallow and fast.
- We're workin' on something. Hold on.

1208
01:22:02,354 --> 01:22:04,185
l can't remember
the ratio to temperature.

1209
01:22:04,274 --> 01:22:06,105
We got no references on board.

1210
01:22:06,194 --> 01:22:08,025
Let's see if Houston
can pull up the mill specs.

1211
01:22:08,114 --> 01:22:11,902
Listen, listen! They gave us too much
Delta V. They had us burn too long.

1212
01:22:11,994 --> 01:22:15,066
At this rate we're gonna skip
right out of the atmosphere,
and we're never gonna get back.

1213
01:22:15,154 --> 01:22:18,385
What are you talkin' about?
How'd you figure that?

1214
01:22:18,474 --> 01:22:20,146
l can add.

1215
01:22:22,194 --> 01:22:25,584
- They've got half the Ph.D.s
on the planet working on this.
- Houston says we're on the money.

1216
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,710
What if they made a mistake and
there was no way to reverse it?

1217
01:22:27,794 --> 01:22:29,591
Do you think they would tell us?

1218
01:22:29,634 --> 01:22:32,944
- There's no reason to tell us.
- What do you mean? That's bullshit!

1219
01:22:32,994 --> 01:22:35,383
There's a thousand things
that have to happen in order.

1220
01:22:35,474 --> 01:22:40,343
We are on number eight.
You're talking about number 692.

1221
01:22:40,434 --> 01:22:43,392
ln the meantime, l'm trying to
tell you we're coming in too fast.

1222
01:22:43,474 --> 01:22:46,432
l think they know it, and that's why
we don't have a goddamn reentry plan.

1223
01:22:46,514 --> 01:22:48,470
That's duly noted.
Thank you, Jack.

1224
01:22:48,554 --> 01:22:51,022
Ow!

1225
01:22:51,074 --> 01:22:52,951
- Goddamn this piece of shit!
- Hey!

1226
01:22:52,994 --> 01:22:55,189
- This piece of shit's
gonna get you home.
- All right.

1227
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:58,783
That's because that's
the only thing we got left, Jack!

1228
01:22:58,874 --> 01:23:03,186
- What are you saying, Fred?
- l think you know what l'm saying.

1229
01:23:03,234 --> 01:23:06,783
Now wait a minute.
All l did was stir those tanks.

1230
01:23:06,874 --> 01:23:08,705
What was that gauge reading
before you hit the switch?

1231
01:23:08,794 --> 01:23:10,705
-Don't tell me how to fly the damn C.M.!
-You don't know, do you?

1232
01:23:10,754 --> 01:23:12,153
They brought me in to do a job!

1233
01:23:12,194 --> 01:23:14,549
They asked me to stir the tanks,
and l stirred the tanks!

1234
01:23:14,634 --> 01:23:18,388
- Stop kicking yourself in the ass.
- This is not my fault!

1235
01:23:18,434 --> 01:23:20,311
No one is saying it is.

1236
01:23:20,354 --> 01:23:23,346
lf l'm in the left-hand seat when
the call comes up, l stir the tanks.

1237
01:23:23,434 --> 01:23:24,867
Yeah, well, tell him that.

1238
01:23:24,954 --> 01:23:28,026
l just asked you what the gauge
was readin', and you don't know!

1239
01:23:28,114 --> 01:23:30,025
Look, we're not doing this.
We are not gonna do this.

1240
01:23:30,074 --> 01:23:32,463
We're not gonna go bouncing
off the walls for ten minutes...

1241
01:23:32,514 --> 01:23:35,347
because we're just gonna end up right
back here with the same problems!

1242
01:23:35,394 --> 01:23:38,386
Try to figure out
how to stay alive!

1243
01:23:38,994 --> 01:23:40,825
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1244
01:23:40,914 --> 01:23:43,587
- Are we on VOX?
- No, we're not on VOX.

1245
01:23:43,674 --> 01:23:46,108
Yeah, Houston, this is Aquarius.
Go ahead.

1246
01:23:46,194 --> 01:23:51,666
Yeah, Jim, could you check
your CO2 gauge for us?

1247
01:23:53,234 --> 01:23:55,702
Yeah, Houston,
we were just looking at that.

1248
01:23:55,794 --> 01:23:59,548
Our CO2 measurement has jumped
four notches in the last hour.

1249
01:23:59,634 --> 01:24:02,387
That can't be right.
l went over those numbers three times.

1250
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:06,149
Jim, that sounds about right.
We were expecting that.

1251
01:24:06,234 --> 01:24:09,351
That's very comforting, Houston.
What do we do about it?

1252
01:24:09,434 --> 01:24:13,825
We're working on a procedure
down here for you.

1253
01:24:13,914 --> 01:24:16,223
- Do you copy?
- Oh, Christ.

1254
01:24:16,314 --> 01:24:18,305
All right, Houston, we're
standing by for those procedures.

1255
01:24:18,394 --> 01:24:21,511
Christ, l know why
my numbers are wrong.

1256
01:24:21,594 --> 01:24:24,233
l only figured it
for two people.

1257
01:24:27,514 --> 01:24:31,109
Maybe l should just
hold my breath.

1258
01:24:31,194 --> 01:24:35,745
The deadly CO2 gas is poisoning the
astronauts with every breath in and out.

1259
01:24:35,834 --> 01:24:38,712
Heads up. Heads up.

1260
01:24:38,794 --> 01:24:42,150
- Oh! Go, go, go, go!
- Someone get that. Damn.

1261
01:24:42,234 --> 01:24:44,111
Heads up, people.
Look out now.

1262
01:24:47,194 --> 01:24:50,550
- What's this?
- That's what they gotta make.

1263
01:24:50,634 --> 01:24:53,910
- l hope you got the procedures for me.
- Right here.

1264
01:24:53,994 --> 01:24:55,825
That's it?

1265
01:24:57,674 --> 01:24:59,505
All right, Aquarius, this is Houston.

1266
01:24:59,594 --> 01:25:01,425
Do you have a flight plan?

1267
01:25:01,514 --> 01:25:04,472
Affirmative, Andy.
Jack's got one right here.

1268
01:25:04,554 --> 01:25:08,308
Okay, we have an unusual
procedure for you here.

1269
01:25:08,354 --> 01:25:10,231
We need you
to rip the cover off.

1270
01:25:10,274 --> 01:25:12,629
He wants you to rip the cover
off the flight plan.

1271
01:25:12,714 --> 01:25:15,706
With pleasure.

1272
01:25:15,794 --> 01:25:17,989
The other materials
you're gonna need here are...

1273
01:25:18,074 --> 01:25:19,905
- a lithium hydroxide canister--
- Two, two.

1274
01:25:19,994 --> 01:25:22,064
Two lithium hydroxide canisters.
l'm sorry.

1275
01:25:22,154 --> 01:25:24,509
- A roll of gray tape.
- Duct tape.

1276
01:25:24,594 --> 01:25:29,463
Duct tape. You need an L.C.G. bag--
Two L.C.G. bags.

1277
01:25:29,554 --> 01:25:32,944
The red suit hoses,
and you've got the flight plan cover.

1278
01:25:34,954 --> 01:25:37,752
- Can you give me a timetable?
- Henry! Henry!

1279
01:25:37,794 --> 01:25:39,864
What about their level
of carbon dioxide?

1280
01:25:39,954 --> 01:25:42,070
lt's, uh, climbing.

1281
01:25:42,154 --> 01:25:45,624
You're saying that they're
almost out of breathable air?

1282
01:25:45,714 --> 01:25:50,230
Wait a second. That's not what he said.
He said we're working on it.

1283
01:25:50,274 --> 01:25:53,789
You want to cut
the duct tape three feet long.

1284
01:25:53,874 --> 01:25:55,910
- Tell him to use his arm.
- Just use your arm.

1285
01:25:55,994 --> 01:25:58,713
- lt's a good arm length.
- l see what you're getting at. Hold on.

1286
01:25:58,794 --> 01:26:01,752
Jack, tear that piece of tape
down the middle lengthwise.

1287
01:26:01,834 --> 01:26:04,143
- All right?
- Hold on, Houston.

1288
01:26:05,794 --> 01:26:08,786
While the astronauts appear to have
enough oxygen to keep them alive,

1289
01:26:08,874 --> 01:26:11,991
one thing they have too much of
is carbon dioxide.

1290
01:26:12,074 --> 01:26:13,905
With each breath,
the three men expel...

1291
01:26:13,994 --> 01:26:17,111
more of the poisonous gas
into the lunar module cockpit,

1292
01:26:17,194 --> 01:26:19,913
and the scrubbers intended to
keep the atmosphere breathable...

1293
01:26:19,994 --> 01:26:21,825
are quickly becoming saturated.

1294
01:26:23,994 --> 01:26:26,064
Oh, shit. l tore it.

1295
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,311
Shit!

1296
01:26:29,394 --> 01:26:33,626
Houston, what do we do if we
ripped the bag? Can we tape it?

1297
01:26:33,714 --> 01:26:35,670
- They just tore the bag.
- Oh, no.

1298
01:26:35,754 --> 01:26:37,745
Uh, stand by.
What should l tell 'em to do?

1299
01:26:37,834 --> 01:26:39,586
They should have one more.

1300
01:26:39,674 --> 01:26:42,234
But they've still got
a long way to come.

1301
01:26:42,314 --> 01:26:46,830
They are now working on their backup
facilities, their emergency facilities.

1302
01:26:46,874 --> 01:26:51,072
The problem is, if anything more
goes wrong, they're in real trouble.

1303
01:27:18,794 --> 01:27:22,673
As most of you are aware, there is
no rescue possible in space flight.

1304
01:27:22,714 --> 01:27:25,547
A-Any rescue system the space agency
has long since calculated--

1305
01:27:25,594 --> 01:27:27,471
Hold this a minute.

1306
01:27:27,514 --> 01:27:30,665
Since any rescue system
the space agency calculated--

1307
01:27:35,234 --> 01:27:37,873
- One sock.
- Once you have the sock in place,

1308
01:27:37,914 --> 01:27:40,474
- we're gonna want you to bungee...
- Work it in.

1309
01:27:40,554 --> 01:27:42,749
the entire filter assembly
to the bulkhead,

1310
01:27:42,834 --> 01:27:46,270
- right above the LEM canister.
- We're getting close to 15.

1311
01:27:46,354 --> 01:27:50,905
So how does this flight compare to other
emergency situations you've faced?

1312
01:27:50,994 --> 01:27:55,385
l'd have to say that this is
the most serious situation...

1313
01:27:55,474 --> 01:27:58,147
we've ever encountered
in manned space flight.

1314
01:27:58,234 --> 01:28:02,113
- Houston, filter's in place.
- Cabin gas return to egress.

1315
01:28:02,194 --> 01:28:04,344
Suit circuit relief to close.

1316
01:28:04,434 --> 01:28:08,666
- CO2 canister select to secondary.
- All right.

1317
01:28:08,754 --> 01:28:11,712
Here goes.

1318
01:28:11,794 --> 01:28:14,627
l can hear air moving.

1319
01:28:25,394 --> 01:28:27,908
Just breathe normal, fellas.

1320
01:28:29,914 --> 01:28:33,623
Aquarius, please advise on CO2 status.

1321
01:28:33,714 --> 01:28:36,592
Yeah, Houston, we're taking
a look at those numbers now.

1322
01:28:39,234 --> 01:28:42,385
We're still holding
close to 15, Houston.

1323
01:28:42,474 --> 01:28:44,704
Roger that. Standing by.

1324
01:28:55,394 --> 01:28:59,831
Houston, the CO2 level
has dropped to nine...

1325
01:28:59,874 --> 01:29:03,503
and it is still falling.

1326
01:29:03,594 --> 01:29:06,392
- Yes!
- Great. Good job, you guys.

1327
01:29:06,434 --> 01:29:08,948
That is good to hear, Aquarius.

1328
01:29:08,994 --> 01:29:12,623
And you, sir,
are a steely-eyed missile man.

1329
01:29:15,914 --> 01:29:18,064
Okay, spacecraft control to computer.

1330
01:29:18,114 --> 01:29:20,674
Damn!

1331
01:29:23,714 --> 01:29:25,591
Damn.

1332
01:29:25,634 --> 01:29:27,750
We overloaded.

1333
01:29:27,834 --> 01:29:29,665
We used way too much power.

1334
01:29:29,754 --> 01:29:33,429
There must be a sneak circuit
between step seven and ten.

1335
01:29:33,474 --> 01:29:38,787
- Which one has the leak?
- Don't know that yet, John.

1336
01:29:38,874 --> 01:29:41,752
The sequence was wrong. We just have to
go back and try 'em one at a time.

1337
01:29:41,834 --> 01:29:44,871
You need a break, Ken?

1338
01:29:44,954 --> 01:29:47,832
lf they don't get one,
l don't get one.

1339
01:29:51,834 --> 01:29:54,302
Well, if it won't work,
get me another one.

1340
01:29:54,394 --> 01:29:57,511
- My son's supposed to be on.
- l know, Mrs. Lovell.

1341
01:29:57,594 --> 01:30:02,463
- Hi, Blanch.
- They can't fix a thing in this place.

1342
01:30:02,554 --> 01:30:05,352
Blanch, it's Marilyn.

1343
01:30:05,434 --> 01:30:07,425
Hi, Grandma.

1344
01:30:07,514 --> 01:30:12,463
- l was gonna see Jimmy.
- l know. l know.

1345
01:30:12,514 --> 01:30:16,393
We came to tell you something.

1346
01:30:16,474 --> 01:30:21,184
There's been an accident.
Jimmy's okay. He's all right.

1347
01:30:21,274 --> 01:30:25,426
But he's not gonna get
to walk on the moon.

1348
01:30:25,514 --> 01:30:28,665
Well, they said he was.

1349
01:30:28,754 --> 01:30:30,631
l know. l know.

1350
01:30:30,714 --> 01:30:34,707
Um... that was before.

1351
01:30:34,794 --> 01:30:38,389
Now there's been an explosion,
and they're all okay.

1352
01:30:38,434 --> 01:30:42,473
They're all right.
But now they're just going to...

1353
01:30:42,554 --> 01:30:45,990
try to figure out
a way to get them home.

1354
01:30:46,074 --> 01:30:51,353
And--

1355
01:30:51,434 --> 01:30:55,188
And it's a little bit dangerous.

1356
01:30:55,274 --> 01:30:58,471
Oh, sweetie.

1357
01:31:00,394 --> 01:31:02,544
Are you scared?

1358
01:31:05,794 --> 01:31:09,104
Well, don't you worry, honey.

1359
01:31:09,194 --> 01:31:13,585
lf they could get
a washing machine to fly,

1360
01:31:13,674 --> 01:31:16,791
my Jimmy could land it.

1361
01:31:18,354 --> 01:31:23,826
You saw me standing alone

1362
01:31:27,434 --> 01:31:32,906
Without a dream in my heart

1363
01:31:35,274 --> 01:31:41,509
Without a love of my own

1364
01:31:53,274 --> 01:31:57,552
Jack, you'll be happy to hear
we contacted President Nixon,

1365
01:31:57,594 --> 01:32:01,064
and he's gonna grant you
an extension on your income taxes...

1366
01:32:01,114 --> 01:32:05,869
since you are most decidedly
out of the country.

1367
01:32:05,914 --> 01:32:08,428
Roger that, Houston.

1368
01:32:08,474 --> 01:32:11,193
That's wonderful news.

1369
01:32:11,234 --> 01:32:13,429
Tell them they have to sleep.

1370
01:32:13,474 --> 01:32:15,669
Haise is running a fever of 104.

1371
01:32:15,754 --> 01:32:19,224
Thirteen, we've had another
request from the flight surgeon...

1372
01:32:19,314 --> 01:32:21,145
that you fellas get more sleep.

1373
01:32:21,234 --> 01:32:24,271
He doesn't like
his readings down here.

1374
01:32:24,314 --> 01:32:26,350
Let's see how
he feels about this.

1375
01:32:26,394 --> 01:32:29,511
l am sick and tired
of the entire western world...

1376
01:32:29,594 --> 01:32:34,714
knowing how my kidneys
are functioning!

1377
01:32:34,754 --> 01:32:38,906
Flight, l just lost Lovell!

1378
01:32:43,354 --> 01:32:45,914
Uh, Thirteen, this is Houston.

1379
01:32:45,994 --> 01:32:49,430
Jim, we just had a dropout
on your bio-med sensors.

1380
01:32:49,474 --> 01:32:53,467
l'm not wearing
my bio-med sensors, Houston.

1381
01:33:02,194 --> 01:33:05,789
Okay, Jim. Copy that.

1382
01:33:19,154 --> 01:33:23,033
Now l'm losing all three of 'em!

1383
01:33:23,114 --> 01:33:25,628
lt's just a little
medical mutiny, Doc.

1384
01:33:25,714 --> 01:33:27,750
l'm sure the guys
are still with us.

1385
01:33:27,834 --> 01:33:30,871
Let's cut 'em
some slack, okay?

1386
01:33:42,114 --> 01:33:46,073
lt's not the velocity,
it's the angle.

1387
01:33:46,114 --> 01:33:49,584
Maybe they're still venting something
that's throwing off the trajectory,

1388
01:33:49,634 --> 01:33:51,511
but we are definitely
shallowing again.

1389
01:33:51,554 --> 01:33:55,024
- We are up to a 5.9.
- Damn it.

1390
01:33:55,074 --> 01:33:57,793
At this rate, they nick the earth's
atmosphere and bounce off into space.

1391
01:33:57,874 --> 01:34:00,149
- We need another burn
to get them back in the corridor.
- Definitely another burn.

1392
01:34:00,194 --> 01:34:03,630
-Another burn. Copy that.
-Fire the engines and get 'em on course.

1393
01:34:22,274 --> 01:34:24,469
Aquarius, this is Houston.

1394
01:34:24,514 --> 01:34:27,904
Houston, Aquarius.

1395
01:34:27,994 --> 01:34:31,066
Jim, we've got another
course correction for you.

1396
01:34:31,154 --> 01:34:33,145
What's up?

1397
01:34:33,234 --> 01:34:35,873
Something about another
course correction.

1398
01:34:35,954 --> 01:34:38,787
Uh, we copy, Houston.

1399
01:34:38,874 --> 01:34:43,026
Be advised it's gonna take Freddo and l
a while to power up the computer...

1400
01:34:43,114 --> 01:34:46,151
for the alignment platform
if we have to fire the engine.

1401
01:34:46,234 --> 01:34:48,065
Negative on that, Jim.

1402
01:34:48,154 --> 01:34:51,271
We can't spare power
for the computer.

1403
01:34:51,354 --> 01:34:53,345
We gotta do this blind?

1404
01:34:53,434 --> 01:34:57,347
Without the computer,
what do we use for orientation?

1405
01:34:57,434 --> 01:35:00,028
We've got to be able
to give these guys something.

1406
01:35:00,114 --> 01:35:02,309
Without the power,
we can't give them a reading.

1407
01:35:02,394 --> 01:35:04,225
l'm not talking about power,
l'm talking about reference.

1408
01:35:04,314 --> 01:35:06,953
No, there's no references.
We have debris up there.

1409
01:35:07,314 --> 01:35:10,306
Houston, what's the story
with this burn?

1410
01:35:10,394 --> 01:35:13,192
We're trying to hash something out
down here, Aquarius.

1411
01:35:13,274 --> 01:35:15,105
Stand by.

1412
01:35:15,194 --> 01:35:20,222
Look, Houston. All we need to hold
attitude is one fixed point in space.

1413
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:24,387
- ls that not correct?
- Yeah. Roger that, Jim.

1414
01:35:26,194 --> 01:35:30,472
Well, Houston, we've got one.

1415
01:35:30,554 --> 01:35:34,308
lf we can keep the Earth
in the window, flying manually,

1416
01:35:34,394 --> 01:35:36,225
the co-ax cross hairs
right on its terminator,

1417
01:35:36,314 --> 01:35:39,829
all l have to know is: how long
do we need to burn the engine?

1418
01:35:39,874 --> 01:35:43,105
- The shorter, the better.
- Roger that, Jim.

1419
01:35:43,194 --> 01:35:45,344
Can they fly it manually
and still shut it down...

1420
01:35:45,434 --> 01:35:47,902
on time without the computer?

1421
01:35:49,554 --> 01:35:51,909
l guess that's the best we can do.

1422
01:35:51,994 --> 01:35:53,905
We're out of time.

1423
01:35:53,954 --> 01:35:55,831
ln order to enter
the atmosphere safely,

1424
01:35:55,874 --> 01:35:59,105
the crew must aim for a corridor
just two and a half degrees wide.

1425
01:35:59,194 --> 01:36:02,470
lf they're too steep, they'll incinerate
in the steadily thickening air.

1426
01:36:02,554 --> 01:36:04,385
lf they're too shallow,
they'll ricochet...

1427
01:36:04,474 --> 01:36:06,783
off the atmosphere like
a rock skipping off a pond.

1428
01:36:06,874 --> 01:36:09,024
The reentry corridor is,
in fact, so narrow...

1429
01:36:09,114 --> 01:36:11,105
that if this basketball
were the Earth...

1430
01:36:11,194 --> 01:36:13,025
and this softball
were the moon,

1431
01:36:13,114 --> 01:36:15,423
and the two were placed
14 feet apart,

1432
01:36:15,514 --> 01:36:19,553
the crew would have to hit a target
no thicker than this piece of paper.

1433
01:36:19,634 --> 01:36:21,909
Okay, people, on your toes.
We're doing this one blind.

1434
01:36:21,994 --> 01:36:24,462
Gene, l want you to understand
we've never tried this before:

1435
01:36:24,554 --> 01:36:28,308
burn, cold soak, burn,
cold soak, burn, manual control.

1436
01:36:28,394 --> 01:36:30,385
Look, it will ignite, will it not?

1437
01:36:30,474 --> 01:36:33,750
l just want you to know the engine's
never been tried like this.

1438
01:36:33,834 --> 01:36:36,143
That's all l'm trying to tell you.

1439
01:36:36,234 --> 01:36:38,065
l know what you're trying to do.

1440
01:36:38,154 --> 01:36:40,304
l guarantee you, l won't hold you
personally responsible.

1441
01:36:40,394 --> 01:36:44,182
lf it lights, it lights.
Let Lovell do the rest.

1442
01:36:44,274 --> 01:36:46,105
Okay.

1443
01:36:46,194 --> 01:36:48,310
They're gonna burn the engines
and steer it manually,

1444
01:36:48,394 --> 01:36:51,147
attempting to keep
the Earth in the window.

1445
01:36:57,594 --> 01:37:00,631
Okay, this is gonna take
all three of us.

1446
01:37:00,714 --> 01:37:02,944
Freddo...

1447
01:37:03,034 --> 01:37:04,865
you handle the pitch.

1448
01:37:04,954 --> 01:37:07,263
Put on the translation
controllers, all backwards.

1449
01:37:07,354 --> 01:37:09,914
So if the Earth starts drifting down,

1450
01:37:09,954 --> 01:37:13,742
you need to thrust aft,
not forward.

1451
01:37:13,834 --> 01:37:15,711
l'll do the same on mine
with everything else.

1452
01:37:15,794 --> 01:37:18,547
We're going to burn at ten percent
thrust for 39 seconds.

1453
01:37:18,594 --> 01:37:21,233
- Jack, you time us.
- Got it.

1454
01:37:21,274 --> 01:37:24,471
Give us a count of
the last ten seconds up to 39.

1455
01:37:24,554 --> 01:37:26,909
Let's not miss this.

1456
01:37:28,474 --> 01:37:31,864
You up to this, Freddo?

1457
01:37:31,954 --> 01:37:33,785
l'm with you.

1458
01:37:33,874 --> 01:37:37,310
Standing by
for corridor control burn.

1459
01:37:37,394 --> 01:37:40,033
Okay, Jim,
you can fire when ready.

1460
01:37:40,114 --> 01:37:42,389
You are go
for the manual burn.

1461
01:37:42,434 --> 01:37:45,949
Okay, X plus button
at ten seconds. Mark.

1462
01:37:46,034 --> 01:37:48,628
- Come on, baby. One more burn.
- Nine, eight,

1463
01:37:48,674 --> 01:37:51,188
seven, six, five,

1464
01:37:51,274 --> 01:37:53,424
- four, three,
- Ullage is go.

1465
01:37:53,514 --> 01:37:56,472
two, one, ignition!

1466
01:37:57,554 --> 01:37:59,306
- She's burnin'!
- Oh, yeah.

1467
01:37:59,354 --> 01:38:02,107
- Master arm off.
- Okay, here we go.

1468
01:38:02,194 --> 01:38:05,948
- Helium regulator on.
- R.C.S. is go, 10/ thrust.

1469
01:38:06,034 --> 01:38:09,390
- Bring her around, Freddo.
- l'm tryin', but it's draggin'.

1470
01:38:09,434 --> 01:38:12,312
- Ten seconds.
- Drop it down, Freddo.

1471
01:38:12,354 --> 01:38:14,390
- We're driftin'!
- No, hold what you got.

1472
01:38:14,474 --> 01:38:16,510
- l'll roll it. Back off.
- l can't get it stable.

1473
01:38:16,594 --> 01:38:18,983
She's dancin' all over the place!

1474
01:38:19,034 --> 01:38:21,389
- Come to the right a little bit.
- Fifteen seconds.

1475
01:38:21,434 --> 01:38:23,789
She's driftin'.
l'm losin' attitude.

1476
01:38:23,834 --> 01:38:26,394
Hold it right there.
That's it. No, Freddo, back!

1477
01:38:26,434 --> 01:38:28,948
- Shit! l'm losin' it!
- Bring the Earth up.

1478
01:38:29,034 --> 01:38:32,310
Forward, Fred.
Come on. Forward.

1479
01:38:32,394 --> 01:38:34,954
Shit, l lost it!
Where is it? Where is it?

1480
01:38:35,034 --> 01:38:36,865
7:00. Helium regulator's closed.

1481
01:38:36,954 --> 01:38:39,184
Bring it down, Freddo.
Just nose it down.

1482
01:38:39,274 --> 01:38:40,946
- Okay, uh, okay, l got it!
- Thirty seconds.

1483
01:38:40,994 --> 01:38:43,667
Little farther.
Ease your touch!

1484
01:38:43,714 --> 01:38:48,788
Damn it! Damn it, that's mine.
That's me. Around.

1485
01:38:48,834 --> 01:38:51,792
- A little more. Come on, baby.
- Come on, that's it. Hold it. Damn it!

1486
01:38:51,834 --> 01:38:54,746
- Back! That's it! Hold it! Steady.
- ...seven, eight, nine!

1487
01:38:54,834 --> 01:38:57,428
Shutdown!

1488
01:39:04,954 --> 01:39:08,151
Houston, we have shutdown.

1489
01:39:08,194 --> 01:39:11,823
That's close enough, Jim. Good work.

1490
01:39:11,874 --> 01:39:14,752
l knew it! l knew it!
How about that LEM, huh?

1491
01:39:14,834 --> 01:39:17,109
How about it?

1492
01:39:17,194 --> 01:39:19,788
- Guess you can keep your job.
- You betcha.

1493
01:39:19,834 --> 01:39:24,271
Thirteen, stand by. We're evaluating
our power usage on that burn.

1494
01:39:24,314 --> 01:39:28,102
Well, let's hope we don't
have to do that again.

1495
01:39:41,274 --> 01:39:46,064
Gentlemen, you've given our guys
enough to survive 'til reentry.

1496
01:39:46,114 --> 01:39:47,991
Well done.

1497
01:39:50,154 --> 01:39:54,352
Now we gotta get 'em in, so tell me
about the power-up procedures.

1498
01:39:54,394 --> 01:39:56,783
Here's the order
of what l want to do.

1499
01:39:56,874 --> 01:40:01,390
l want to power up Guidance,
E.C.S., Communications,

1500
01:40:01,434 --> 01:40:05,313
warm up the pyros for the parachutes
and the command module thrusters.

1501
01:40:05,394 --> 01:40:07,703
The thrusters are gonna
put you over budget on amps.

1502
01:40:07,794 --> 01:40:12,026
They've been sitting at 200 below for
four days, John. They gotta be heated.

1503
01:40:12,114 --> 01:40:14,070
Fine. Then trade off
the parachutes, something.

1504
01:40:14,114 --> 01:40:16,947
Well, if the chutes
don't open, what's the point?

1505
01:40:17,034 --> 01:40:19,992
You're telling me what you need.
l'm telling you what we have
to work with at this point.

1506
01:40:20,034 --> 01:40:21,911
l'm not making this stuff up.

1507
01:40:21,954 --> 01:40:24,104
They're going to need
all these systems, John.

1508
01:40:24,154 --> 01:40:28,306
We do not have the power, Ken.
We just don't have it.

1509
01:40:30,114 --> 01:40:33,265
Okay, l'm gonna go back
and reorganize the sequencing again...

1510
01:40:33,354 --> 01:40:35,390
and find more power.

1511
01:40:35,474 --> 01:40:39,387
Let's start from scratch.
Clear the board.

1512
01:40:41,354 --> 01:40:44,027
l don't know where the hell
we're gonna find it.

1513
01:40:44,514 --> 01:40:47,551
Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell
has more time in space,

1514
01:40:47,634 --> 01:40:50,387
almost 24 days already,
than any other man,

1515
01:40:50,474 --> 01:40:52,988
and l asked him recently
if he ever was scared.

1516
01:40:53,074 --> 01:40:56,146
l've had an engine flame out
a few times in an aircraft...

1517
01:40:56,234 --> 01:40:59,670
and was curious as to whether it
was going to light up again,

1518
01:40:59,714 --> 01:41:02,865
but, uh, they seem to work out.

1519
01:41:02,914 --> 01:41:06,065
ls there an instance
in an airplane emergency...

1520
01:41:06,114 --> 01:41:07,991
when you can recall fear?

1521
01:41:08,034 --> 01:41:12,312
Uh, well, l remember this one time,

1522
01:41:12,354 --> 01:41:15,869
l'm in a Banshee at night in
combat conditions, so there's no
running lights on the carrier.

1523
01:41:15,954 --> 01:41:19,310
lt was the Shangri-la,
and we were in the Sea of Japan.

1524
01:41:19,354 --> 01:41:23,142
My radar had jammed,
and my homing signal was gone...

1525
01:41:23,194 --> 01:41:25,469
because somebody in Japan
was actually using the same frequency,

1526
01:41:25,554 --> 01:41:28,751
and so it was leading me away
from where l was supposed to be.

1527
01:41:28,794 --> 01:41:34,266
l'm looking down at a big, black ocean,
so l flip on my map light.

1528
01:41:34,354 --> 01:41:38,063
Then, suddenly, zap, everything
shorts out right there in my cockpit.

1529
01:41:38,114 --> 01:41:41,743
All my instruments are gone.
My lights are gone and l can't
even tell what my altitude is.

1530
01:41:41,794 --> 01:41:46,822
l know l'm running out of fuel, so l'm
thinking about ditching into the ocean.

1531
01:41:46,874 --> 01:41:50,230
l look down there
and then, in the darkness,

1532
01:41:50,274 --> 01:41:53,266
there's this, uh,
there's this green trail.

1533
01:41:53,314 --> 01:41:57,785
lt's like a long carpet that's just laid
out right beneath me. lt was the algae.

1534
01:41:57,874 --> 01:41:59,705
lt was that phosphorescent stuff...

1535
01:41:59,794 --> 01:42:02,069
that gets churned up
in the wake of a big ship.

1536
01:42:02,154 --> 01:42:05,112
lt was, it was, it was
just leading me home.

1537
01:42:05,154 --> 01:42:07,031
lf my cockpit lights
hadn't shorted out,

1538
01:42:07,074 --> 01:42:10,305
there's no way l'd have ever
been able to see that.

1539
01:42:10,394 --> 01:42:12,783
So, uh, you, uh,
you never know...

1540
01:42:12,834 --> 01:42:16,463
what, what events are going
to transpire to get you home.

1541
01:42:19,794 --> 01:42:25,073
Spacecraft commander Jim Lovell,
no stranger to emergencies.

1542
01:42:34,834 --> 01:42:38,304
- How's it going, Fred?
- l'm okay.

1543
01:42:38,394 --> 01:42:42,069
What the hell was that?

1544
01:42:42,114 --> 01:42:44,947
Let's hope it was
just the burst disk.

1545
01:42:45,034 --> 01:42:49,073
- Can you confirm a burst helium disk?
- We confirm that.

1546
01:42:49,114 --> 01:42:53,107
Houston, is that going to
affect our, uh, entry angle at all?

1547
01:42:53,194 --> 01:42:56,311
Uh, negative. Your entry angle
is holding at 6.24, Aquarius.

1548
01:42:56,394 --> 01:42:58,908
Houston, uh...

1549
01:42:58,994 --> 01:43:02,225
we, we sure could use...

1550
01:43:02,274 --> 01:43:04,469
the reentry procedure up here.

1551
01:43:04,554 --> 01:43:06,590
When can we expect that?

1552
01:43:08,754 --> 01:43:11,348
Uh, that's coming
real soon, Aquarius.

1553
01:43:11,434 --> 01:43:13,994
Uh, Houston, we, we--

1554
01:43:14,074 --> 01:43:17,066
We just can't throw this
together at the last minute.

1555
01:43:17,114 --> 01:43:19,674
So, here's what you're gonna do.

1556
01:43:19,754 --> 01:43:23,349
You're gonna get the procedure
up to us, whatever it is,

1557
01:43:23,394 --> 01:43:27,865
and we're gonna go over it
step by step, so there's no foul-ups.

1558
01:43:27,954 --> 01:43:31,344
l don't have to tell you
we're all a little tired up here.

1559
01:43:31,434 --> 01:43:34,073
The world's getting awfully big
in the window.

1560
01:43:34,114 --> 01:43:36,503
- Jim, this is Deke.
- lt's Deke.

1561
01:43:36,594 --> 01:43:38,744
They don't know how to do it.

1562
01:43:38,834 --> 01:43:44,306
- Maybe Jack's right.
- Hello there, Deke. What's the story?

1563
01:43:44,354 --> 01:43:46,310
We're gonna get that
power-up procedure to you.

1564
01:43:46,394 --> 01:43:48,271
We're gonna get it
as soon as we possibly can.

1565
01:43:48,314 --> 01:43:52,432
Ken Mattingly's
in the simulator right now.

1566
01:43:52,474 --> 01:43:54,749
Ken's working on it?

1567
01:43:54,914 --> 01:43:59,032
Look...

1568
01:43:59,114 --> 01:44:00,945
l know this sequence works, John.

1569
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:03,753
The sequence looks good.
We're just over budget on the amperage.

1570
01:44:03,834 --> 01:44:06,109
- By how much?
- Three or four amps.

1571
01:44:06,194 --> 01:44:08,264
Goddamn it, John!
ls it three or four?

1572
01:44:08,314 --> 01:44:10,111
- Four.
- Four!

1573
01:44:10,194 --> 01:44:13,743
Four more amps.

1574
01:44:23,194 --> 01:44:25,913
We know they have some power left
in the LEM batteries, right?

1575
01:44:25,954 --> 01:44:28,149
Yeah.

1576
01:44:28,234 --> 01:44:32,147
We have an umbilical that provides power
from the command module to the LEM.

1577
01:44:32,194 --> 01:44:35,550
- lt's backup for the LEM power supply.
- l'm listening.

1578
01:44:35,634 --> 01:44:37,750
So... reverse it.

1579
01:44:37,834 --> 01:44:39,984
Reverse the flow and see if
we can draw these four amps...

1580
01:44:40,074 --> 01:44:41,905
from the LEM batteries
before we cut it lose.

1581
01:44:41,994 --> 01:44:46,067
- Why can't we do that?
- We don't have a procedure for that?

1582
01:44:46,154 --> 01:44:48,145
You're gonna lose a lot
in the transfer, Ken.

1583
01:44:48,194 --> 01:44:51,982
Yeah, yeah, but all we're
talking about here is four amps.

1584
01:44:52,034 --> 01:44:55,026
l want whatever you guys got
on these power procedures.

1585
01:44:55,114 --> 01:44:58,390
- Gene, they're already--
- l don't want the whole bible,
just a couple of chapters.

1586
01:44:58,474 --> 01:45:00,624
- We've got to get something
up to these guys.
- They're working on it.

1587
01:45:00,714 --> 01:45:03,023
- l'll call the simulator
and get an estimate.
- Goddamn it!

1588
01:45:03,114 --> 01:45:08,142
l don't want another estimate!
l want the procedures... now!

1589
01:45:17,994 --> 01:45:19,950
l.M.U. is up.

1590
01:45:21,354 --> 01:45:23,993
- How am l reading?
- Fine, so far.

1591
01:45:24,074 --> 01:45:26,383
- Say again.
- You're under the limit. Keep going.

1592
01:45:26,434 --> 01:45:29,551
Okay. Floodlights to fixed.

1593
01:45:30,754 --> 01:45:35,032
Okay, l'm bringing up the guidance.

1594
01:45:35,074 --> 01:45:37,542
Here we go.

1595
01:45:39,514 --> 01:45:41,550
C.M.C. attitude l.M.U.

1596
01:45:41,594 --> 01:45:44,427
C.M.C. source.

1597
01:45:44,474 --> 01:45:48,672
C.M.C. mode, auto,
and we're on the computer.

1598
01:45:55,194 --> 01:45:57,708
Ken?

1599
01:45:57,754 --> 01:46:00,791
- Go ahead.
- ls your computer on now?

1600
01:46:00,874 --> 01:46:05,026
Up and running.
How do we look?

1601
01:46:08,554 --> 01:46:10,670
John?

1602
01:46:13,874 --> 01:46:15,990
l think we got it, buddy.

1603
01:46:25,914 --> 01:46:28,269
Arthur, my notes are clear
on that last sequence, right?

1604
01:46:28,314 --> 01:46:29,713
Yeah.

1605
01:46:29,754 --> 01:46:31,665
- Excuse me, gentlemen.
- l was getting a little blurry there.

1606
01:46:35,514 --> 01:46:37,869
Here's Ken. Here's John.

1607
01:46:37,914 --> 01:46:39,950
lt's good to see you, Ken.

1608
01:46:39,994 --> 01:46:42,030
This is the sequence.

1609
01:46:42,074 --> 01:46:44,429
- Was it tried on the hardware yet?
- We didn't have time.

1610
01:46:46,394 --> 01:46:49,067
Aquarius, Houston.
Do you read?

1611
01:46:49,114 --> 01:46:53,073
Yeah, we read you, Ken.

1612
01:46:53,114 --> 01:46:55,867
Are the flowers blooming in Houston?

1613
01:46:55,954 --> 01:47:00,630
Uh, that's a negative, Jim.
l don't have the measles.

1614
01:47:02,314 --> 01:47:06,353
Jim, is Jack in there with you?

1615
01:47:06,394 --> 01:47:09,704
Uh, yeah, stand by one.
We gotta get him on comm.

1616
01:47:09,754 --> 01:47:12,587
- Put those on the table.
- Oh, damn it. Thanks, Jackie.

1617
01:47:12,634 --> 01:47:14,829
l think it would
really help if you could...

1618
01:47:14,874 --> 01:47:19,311
just distract her when
the heavy predictions come in.

1619
01:47:19,354 --> 01:47:22,027
- Yeah, yeah. We'll give it a shot.
- Thanks.

1620
01:47:22,074 --> 01:47:23,951
Blanch.

1621
01:47:23,994 --> 01:47:27,384
Blanch, these nice, young men
are gonna watch the television with you.

1622
01:47:27,474 --> 01:47:29,624
This is Neil Armstrong,
and this is Buzz Aldrin.

1623
01:47:29,714 --> 01:47:31,067
Nice to meet you.

1624
01:47:31,154 --> 01:47:36,182
- Hi.
- Are you boys in the space program too?

1625
01:47:36,274 --> 01:47:40,267
Okay, Jack, give me a read-back
on that last procedure.

1626
01:47:40,314 --> 01:47:44,990
Uh, stand by, Ken.

1627
01:47:45,074 --> 01:47:49,625
Ken, l'm having trouble
reading my own writing.

1628
01:47:49,714 --> 01:47:53,150
l guess l was a little
more tired than l thought.

1629
01:47:57,874 --> 01:48:00,388
Uh, don't worry, Jack.
l'll talk you through it.

1630
01:48:02,834 --> 01:48:05,826
Okay, find the main
bus breakers on panel 11.

1631
01:48:07,274 --> 01:48:09,105
Yeah, main bus breakers.

1632
01:48:09,194 --> 01:48:11,185
- Got it.
- Close main bus B.

1633
01:48:18,514 --> 01:48:22,553
Ken, there's an awful lot
of condensation on these panels.

1634
01:48:22,594 --> 01:48:24,949
What's the word on these
things shorting out?

1635
01:48:29,474 --> 01:48:32,625
Uh, we'll just take that
one at a time, Jack.

1636
01:48:34,594 --> 01:48:38,223
lt's like tryin' to drive
a toaster through a car wash.

1637
01:48:44,834 --> 01:48:47,428
Main bus B is closed.

1638
01:48:47,514 --> 01:48:50,187
Okay, Thirteen, we're coming up
on entry interface.

1639
01:48:50,234 --> 01:48:53,863
Flight, we're still shallowing up
a bit in the reentry corridor.

1640
01:48:53,914 --> 01:48:55,984
lt's almost like
they're underweight.

1641
01:48:56,074 --> 01:49:00,909
- Now how could they be underweight?
- We didn't land on the moon.

1642
01:49:00,954 --> 01:49:03,388
- Rocks?
- That's affirm.

1643
01:49:03,474 --> 01:49:05,305
Uh, one more thing, Jim.

1644
01:49:05,394 --> 01:49:07,749
While Jack's working on the power-up,
we'd like you and Freddo...

1645
01:49:07,834 --> 01:49:10,394
to transfer some ballast
over to the command module.

1646
01:49:10,434 --> 01:49:12,311
Uh, say again, Houston.
Ballast?

1647
01:49:12,394 --> 01:49:15,511
Um, that's affirm.
We got to get the weight right.

1648
01:49:15,594 --> 01:49:19,143
We were expecting you to be toting
a couple hundred pounds of moon rocks.

1649
01:49:19,194 --> 01:49:21,071
Right, Houston.

1650
01:49:21,114 --> 01:49:23,184
- Now, Jack.
- Yeah, go ahead, Ken.

1651
01:49:23,274 --> 01:49:26,232
Okay, now, uh, panel five.

1652
01:49:26,314 --> 01:49:31,024
Circuit breaker caution
and warning main B closed.

1653
01:49:31,074 --> 01:49:33,463
Main B closed.

1654
01:49:33,554 --> 01:49:36,022
Master alarm off.

1655
01:49:36,114 --> 01:49:40,027
Okay, Jack, uh, on panel seven,
B-MAG number two, power to warm-up.

1656
01:49:40,114 --> 01:49:42,582
B-MAG number two,
power to warm-up done.

1657
01:49:42,674 --> 01:49:45,552
Sequential logic one and two on.

1658
01:49:45,594 --> 01:49:48,154
Sequential logic... two on.

1659
01:49:48,194 --> 01:49:51,504
C.M.R.C.S. pressure on.

1660
01:49:51,594 --> 01:49:53,391
C.M.R.C.S. pressurization.

1661
01:49:53,954 --> 01:49:56,752
As her husband prepares to jettison
his lunar module lifeboat,

1662
01:49:56,794 --> 01:49:59,547
Marilyn Lovell waits with her
children, her neighbors...

1663
01:49:59,634 --> 01:50:04,150
and, we are told, Apollo 11 astronauts
Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin.

1664
01:50:04,234 --> 01:50:06,794
Only the Lovell's eldest son,
Jay, is absent...

1665
01:50:06,874 --> 01:50:08,705
as he holds vigil
with his classmates...

1666
01:50:08,794 --> 01:50:12,264
at the St. Johns Military Academy
in Wisconsin.

1667
01:50:12,314 --> 01:50:15,465
ABC News science editor
Jules Bergman.

1668
01:50:15,514 --> 01:50:18,586
With a crippled command module, and
surviving by using the LEM's systems,

1669
01:50:18,674 --> 01:50:20,505
there can be no easy maneuver.

1670
01:50:20,594 --> 01:50:23,631
Their LEM lifeboat is doing things
and working longer...

1671
01:50:23,674 --> 01:50:25,551
than it was ever intended to.

1672
01:50:25,594 --> 01:50:27,949
lt's a race against time
until splashdown.

1673
01:50:27,994 --> 01:50:30,224
Okay, Jack, we're ready to see
if the computer will accept...

1674
01:50:30,314 --> 01:50:35,513
- uplink of the reentry data now.
- Okay, the l.M.U. is up.

1675
01:50:35,554 --> 01:50:39,672
- We got our eight-balls back.
- Copy that.

1676
01:50:39,714 --> 01:50:43,024
Okay, Ken, uh, uplink telemetry,
command module to accept, right?

1677
01:50:43,114 --> 01:50:47,505
That's affirm.
Go ahead and try it.

1678
01:50:47,554 --> 01:50:49,510
Come on.

1679
01:51:04,874 --> 01:51:06,705
Uplink completed.

1680
01:51:11,954 --> 01:51:13,910
- Yeah. That's more like it.
- We're back in business.

1681
01:51:13,954 --> 01:51:15,353
- Yeah.
- Okay, let's go.

1682
01:51:15,434 --> 01:51:17,390
Look at your amps. How we doin'?

1683
01:51:20,434 --> 01:51:22,265
We got her back up, Ken.

1684
01:51:22,354 --> 01:51:24,470
Boy, l wish
you were here to see it.

1685
01:51:24,554 --> 01:51:27,864
l'll bet you do.

1686
01:51:27,954 --> 01:51:31,264
Way to go, Jack.

1687
01:51:35,834 --> 01:51:37,870
- Flight, this is RETRO.
- Go, RETRO.

1688
01:51:37,914 --> 01:51:40,303
Flight, we are looking
at a typhoon warning...

1689
01:51:40,394 --> 01:51:43,466
-on the edge of the prime recovery zone.
-Say again, RETRO.

1690
01:51:43,514 --> 01:51:47,302
We are looking at a typhoon warning
on the edge of the prime recovery area.

1691
01:51:47,354 --> 01:51:49,948
This is just a warning.
lt could miss them.

1692
01:51:50,034 --> 01:51:52,468
Only if their luck changes.

1693
01:51:52,834 --> 01:51:54,984
Jim, we're ready
for S.M. jettison!

1694
01:51:55,034 --> 01:51:58,424
All right, Jack, on three!

1695
01:51:58,514 --> 01:52:01,586
One... two...

1696
01:52:01,634 --> 01:52:04,626
- upward thrust.
- We're loose!

1697
01:52:04,714 --> 01:52:06,670
Reverse thrust!

1698
01:52:06,714 --> 01:52:08,750
We have service module jettison.

1699
01:52:08,794 --> 01:52:11,627
Okay, Houston,
service module is free.

1700
01:52:11,674 --> 01:52:13,710
We're gonna take a look
at what we have here.

1701
01:52:13,754 --> 01:52:15,710
Copy that.

1702
01:52:19,314 --> 01:52:21,544
There it is. l see it!

1703
01:52:21,594 --> 01:52:24,347
Oh.

1704
01:52:24,434 --> 01:52:27,870
Houston, we're getting our first look
at the service module now.

1705
01:52:27,954 --> 01:52:31,549
One whole side
of the spacecraft is missing.

1706
01:52:31,634 --> 01:52:35,388
Right by the high gain antennae
a whole panel is blown out,

1707
01:52:35,474 --> 01:52:39,387
right up, right up
to our heat shield.

1708
01:52:39,474 --> 01:52:41,942
Uh, copy that, Aquarius.

1709
01:52:42,034 --> 01:52:44,707
lt looked like it got
the engine bell too. Can you see that?

1710
01:52:48,634 --> 01:52:51,194
Oh, man, that's incredible.

1711
01:52:54,074 --> 01:52:55,666
The heat shield.

1712
01:52:56,194 --> 01:53:01,314
The heat will build up to as much
as 3,000 or 4,000 degrees Fahrenheit.

1713
01:53:01,394 --> 01:53:03,544
On a lunar reentry flight,
the heat approaches 4,000 degrees.

1714
01:53:03,634 --> 01:53:05,272
So, uh, Blanch?

1715
01:53:05,314 --> 01:53:09,148
Blanch? Did Jim make
Eagle Scout or not?

1716
01:53:09,234 --> 01:53:11,190
- Yes, he did.
- He did.

1717
01:53:11,274 --> 01:53:13,424
lf the heat shield
is even slightly cracked,

1718
01:53:13,474 --> 01:53:15,988
the extreme cold
could have split it wide open.

1719
01:53:16,034 --> 01:53:19,185
Worst of all, if the pyrotechnics
that control the parachutes...

1720
01:53:19,234 --> 01:53:21,907
have been damaged,
the chutes may not open at all,

1721
01:53:21,954 --> 01:53:25,629
causing the spacecraft to hit the water
not at a gentle 20 miles per hour,

1722
01:53:25,714 --> 01:53:28,023
but at a suicidal 300.

1723
01:53:28,114 --> 01:53:29,945
Perhaps never in human history...

1724
01:53:30,034 --> 01:53:33,071
has the entire world been united
by such a global drama.

1725
01:53:33,114 --> 01:53:36,151
ln New York City, thousands
of people have gathered...

1726
01:53:36,194 --> 01:53:38,913
to watch updates of the mission
in Times Square.

1727
01:53:38,994 --> 01:53:41,588
Many countries offered help,
and the State Department said...

1728
01:53:41,674 --> 01:53:43,824
it would ask for it
if it were needed.

1729
01:53:43,874 --> 01:53:46,786
The House and Senate passed resolutions
calling on the American people...

1730
01:53:46,874 --> 01:53:49,104
to pray tonight
for the astronauts.

1731
01:53:49,194 --> 01:53:52,345
ln Rome, Pope Paul
led 50,000 people...

1732
01:53:52,434 --> 01:53:55,073
in prayers for the safe
return of the astronauts.

1733
01:53:55,154 --> 01:53:57,429
ln Jerusalem,
prayers at the Wailing Wall.

1734
01:54:03,034 --> 01:54:06,231
Uh, it's about time to bail
out of this ship, Freddo.

1735
01:54:09,954 --> 01:54:11,831
Freddo?

1736
01:54:12,954 --> 01:54:15,070
You okay?

1737
01:54:15,154 --> 01:54:18,271
l'm, uh-- l'm freezing.

1738
01:54:20,114 --> 01:54:22,833
Can you hold out
just a little longer?

1739
01:54:22,874 --> 01:54:25,991
- Long as l have to.
- Aw, come on.

1740
01:54:26,074 --> 01:54:29,828
lt won't be long.
Just a little while longer, Freddo.

1741
01:54:31,794 --> 01:54:36,470
Just a little while longer. We're gonna
hit that water in the South Pacific.

1742
01:54:36,554 --> 01:54:39,830
Open up that hatch.

1743
01:54:39,874 --> 01:54:44,186
- lt's 80 degrees out there.
- Eighty degrees.

1744
01:54:45,514 --> 01:54:49,792
- You are a mess.
- Y-Yeah.

1745
01:54:49,874 --> 01:54:53,184
Odyssey, Houston.
Uh, how we doin', guys?

1746
01:54:53,274 --> 01:54:55,469
We're closing in
on lunar module jettison.

1747
01:54:55,514 --> 01:54:57,470
As you know,
that is time critical.

1748
01:54:57,554 --> 01:55:00,227
We should be making our move
into the command module.

1749
01:55:00,314 --> 01:55:02,145
Let's get that hatch
buttoned up,

1750
01:55:02,234 --> 01:55:05,749
and, when you get a chance,
let us know how you're doing.

1751
01:55:05,834 --> 01:55:07,187
Roger that.

1752
01:55:07,274 --> 01:55:11,347
Let me give you a hand there, Freddo.

1753
01:55:45,234 --> 01:55:47,953
We're coming up on LEM jettison.

1754
01:55:47,994 --> 01:55:50,383
ls everyone strapped in, Ken?
We're getting real close.

1755
01:55:50,434 --> 01:55:54,985
Uh, copy that, Flight. Uh, 13, Houston.
Uh, we're coming up on LEM jettison.

1756
01:55:55,034 --> 01:55:57,104
Stand by.

1757
01:55:57,194 --> 01:55:59,833
Have you got everybody
in the Odyssey?

1758
01:55:59,874 --> 01:56:03,025
Yeah, Ken, l'm gonna check those
pyro batteries one more time here.

1759
01:56:03,114 --> 01:56:05,582
Okay, the pyro batts look good.

1760
01:56:05,634 --> 01:56:08,706
l don't think we're gonna
have to tie the other batteries.

1761
01:56:20,514 --> 01:56:22,869
Sorry, Jack,
this is an old habit.

1762
01:56:22,954 --> 01:56:26,026
l'm kind of used to the pilot's seat.
She's yours to fly.

1763
01:56:30,434 --> 01:56:34,712
Okay, Odyssey, l want to double check
some reentry procedures...

1764
01:56:34,754 --> 01:56:39,191
right after we jettison the LEM,
which is coming up in 30 seconds.

1765
01:56:39,274 --> 01:56:41,390
What is that?

1766
01:56:41,434 --> 01:56:43,664
Oh, l was getting
a little punchy,

1767
01:56:43,754 --> 01:56:47,349
and l didn't want to cut the LEM loose
with you guys still in it.

1768
01:56:47,434 --> 01:56:49,504
That's good thinking.

1769
01:56:51,954 --> 01:56:53,785
Stand by, Houston.

1770
01:56:56,274 --> 01:56:58,947
We have lunar module jettison.

1771
01:57:05,594 --> 01:57:08,347
She sure was a good ship.

1772
01:57:09,674 --> 01:57:13,587
Farewell, Aquarius, and we thank you.

1773
01:57:19,194 --> 01:57:22,789
Mary?

1774
01:57:22,874 --> 01:57:26,230
lt's almost time, honey.

1775
01:57:28,154 --> 01:57:30,110
Flight 9-6-6-4-0-6.

1776
01:57:49,954 --> 01:57:51,626
Let me put it this way.

1777
01:57:51,674 --> 01:57:53,949
The trajectory may be off.
Their thrusters may be frozen.

1778
01:57:54,034 --> 01:57:56,025
Their guidance system
might be malfunctioning.

1779
01:57:56,114 --> 01:57:57,945
Their heat shield could be cracked.

1780
01:57:58,034 --> 01:58:01,151
And their parachutes
might be three blocks of ice.

1781
01:58:01,234 --> 01:58:03,190
Clearly, we have
some obstacles to overcome.

1782
01:58:03,234 --> 01:58:06,465
Yeah, okay, but now l'm asking you,
when will we know?

1783
01:58:06,554 --> 01:58:08,545
Well, blackout lasts
for three minutes.

1784
01:58:08,634 --> 01:58:13,105
lf they're not back
in four, we'll know.

1785
01:58:13,154 --> 01:58:17,466
Velocity now reading
34,802 feet per second.

1786
01:58:17,554 --> 01:58:20,022
- Range to go 2,625 nautical miles.
- Copy that.

1787
01:58:20,114 --> 01:58:23,106
Okay, Ken,
we are aligned for reentry.

1788
01:58:23,194 --> 01:58:25,503
Jim, we're going to need
that computer reentry program.

1789
01:58:25,594 --> 01:58:29,985
- Fred, how are the batteries looking?
- Okay. Batt A looks good.

1790
01:58:30,074 --> 01:58:32,065
Reentry interface in one minute...

1791
01:58:32,154 --> 01:58:36,147
- Batt B, no volts, the amps are okay.
- and 30 seconds.

1792
01:58:36,234 --> 01:58:38,429
Batt C...

1793
01:58:38,514 --> 01:58:41,790
shit, no volts, only two amps.

1794
01:58:41,874 --> 01:58:44,342
lt may die before
the main chutes open.

1795
01:58:44,434 --> 01:58:47,426
Roger. Let's tie all the batteries
onto main A and main B.

1796
01:58:47,514 --> 01:58:50,904
Flight, they're still shallowing a bit
up there. Do you want to tell 'em?

1797
01:58:50,994 --> 01:58:54,623
- ls there anything we can do about it?
- Not now, Flight.

1798
01:58:54,714 --> 01:58:56,989
- Then they don't need to know, do they?
- Copy that.

1799
01:58:57,074 --> 01:58:59,383
RETRO says the typhoon is still
a presence in the splashdown area?

1800
01:58:59,474 --> 01:59:03,513
- Yeah.
- We got the parachute situation,

1801
01:59:03,554 --> 01:59:05,829
the heat shield, the angle
of trajectory and the typhoon.

1802
01:59:05,914 --> 01:59:08,064
There's so many variables,
l'm a little at a loss--

1803
01:59:08,154 --> 01:59:09,667
l know what the problems are.

1804
01:59:09,754 --> 01:59:12,029
This could be the worst disaster
NASA's ever experienced.

1805
01:59:12,114 --> 01:59:17,427
With all due respect, sir, l believe
this is going to be our finest hour.

1806
01:59:17,514 --> 01:59:20,153
Okay.

1807
01:59:28,794 --> 01:59:32,787
Expect entry interface
in 45 seconds.

1808
01:59:32,874 --> 01:59:34,990
And on my mark, your velocity...

1809
01:59:35,034 --> 01:59:39,585
will be 35,245 feet per second.

1810
01:59:39,674 --> 01:59:42,984
Mark 35 seconds
to entry interface.

1811
01:59:45,194 --> 01:59:49,028
Gentlemen...

1812
01:59:49,114 --> 01:59:51,708
it's been a privilege
flying with you.

1813
02:00:31,034 --> 02:00:33,707
Flight, we have loss
of radio contact.

1814
02:00:33,754 --> 02:00:35,028
Roger that.

1815
02:00:35,114 --> 02:00:37,548
Expect to regain signal
in three minutes.

1816
02:00:40,594 --> 02:00:42,869
lt all depends
on the heat shield.

1817
02:01:14,114 --> 02:01:16,628
Back to the lwo Jima
and our live cameras there.

1818
02:01:16,674 --> 02:01:20,792
The Navy recovery and rescue
helicopters already airborne,

1819
02:01:20,874 --> 02:01:23,308
circling, waiting
for first radar contact.

1820
02:01:23,354 --> 02:01:26,266
Coming up now on three minutes
until time of drogue deployment.

1821
02:01:26,354 --> 02:01:28,185
Bill, what time you got?

1822
02:01:28,274 --> 02:01:31,983
Standing by for any reports
of acquisition.

1823
02:01:35,434 --> 02:01:39,188
One minute and 30 seconds
to end of blackout.

1824
02:01:44,114 --> 02:01:45,945
No reentering ship
has ever taken longer...

1825
02:01:46,034 --> 02:01:49,583
than three minutes
to emerge from blackout.

1826
02:01:49,634 --> 02:01:52,432
This is the critical moment.
Will the heat shield hold?

1827
02:01:52,474 --> 02:01:56,262
Will the command module survive
the intense heat of reentry?

1828
02:01:56,314 --> 02:01:59,147
lf it doesn't,
there'll only be silence.

1829
02:01:59,194 --> 02:02:02,504
- Mommy, you're squishing me.
- Oops, sorry, sweetie.

1830
02:02:02,554 --> 02:02:04,510
lt's okay.

1831
02:02:19,194 --> 02:02:21,708
Okay, Flight,
that's three minutes.

1832
02:02:21,754 --> 02:02:25,064
- We are standing by for acquisition.
- Copy that.

1833
02:02:26,474 --> 02:02:29,386
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read me?

1834
02:02:29,434 --> 02:02:31,345
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read?

1835
02:02:31,434 --> 02:02:34,232
Expected time of reacquisition,

1836
02:02:34,274 --> 02:02:37,107
the time when the astronauts were
expected to come out of blackout,

1837
02:02:37,154 --> 02:02:41,591
has come and gone.

1838
02:02:41,674 --> 02:02:45,110
About all any of us can do now
is just listen and hope.

1839
02:02:45,194 --> 02:02:48,584
We're about to learn whether
or not that heat shield,

1840
02:02:48,634 --> 02:02:50,909
which was damaged
by the explosion three days ago,

1841
02:02:50,994 --> 02:02:53,554
has withstood
the inferno of reentry.

1842
02:02:56,834 --> 02:03:00,224
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1843
02:03:02,634 --> 02:03:05,102
Odyssey, Houston.
Do you read?

1844
02:03:05,154 --> 02:03:08,988
Three minutes, 30 seconds. Standing by.

1845
02:03:09,074 --> 02:03:12,828
Odyssey, Houston. Do you read?

1846
02:03:18,674 --> 02:03:23,270
Odyssey, this is Houston.
Do you read me?

1847
02:03:26,074 --> 02:03:28,827
That's four minutes.
Standing by.

1848
02:03:49,634 --> 02:03:52,467
Odyssey, uh, Houston. Do you read?

1849
02:04:00,154 --> 02:04:02,668
Hello, Houston, this is Odyssey.

1850
02:04:02,714 --> 02:04:05,945
lt's good to see you again.

1851
02:04:26,914 --> 02:04:29,747
Odyssey, Houston.
Welcome home.

1852
02:04:29,794 --> 02:04:31,989
We're glad to see you.

1853
02:04:32,034 --> 02:04:34,867
- Good job, Ken. Good job.
- Thank you.

1854
02:05:16,674 --> 02:05:19,825
They made it. They made it.

1855
02:05:30,074 --> 02:05:34,113
- Yeah!
- Lunney.

1856
02:05:59,194 --> 02:06:02,948
Houston, we're at stable one.
The ship is secure.

1857
02:06:03,034 --> 02:06:05,628
This is Apollo 13 signing off.

1858
02:06:05,714 --> 02:06:08,751
Good job.

1859
02:06:55,994 --> 02:06:58,667
Our mission was called
a successful failure,

1860
02:06:58,714 --> 02:07:02,263
in that we returned safely,
but never made it to the moon.

1861
02:07:02,354 --> 02:07:05,585
ln the following months,
it was determined...

1862
02:07:05,674 --> 02:07:08,472
that a damaged coil built
inside the oxygen tank...

1863
02:07:08,554 --> 02:07:12,945
sparked during our cryo stir and caused
the explosion that crippled the Odyssey.

1864
02:07:13,034 --> 02:07:15,343
lt was a minor defect
that occurred two years...

1865
02:07:15,434 --> 02:07:18,392
before l was named
the flight's commander.

1866
02:07:18,474 --> 02:07:21,910
Fred Haise was going back
to the moon on Apollo 18,

1867
02:07:21,994 --> 02:07:24,144
but his mission was canceled
because of budget cuts.

1868
02:07:24,234 --> 02:07:26,111
He never flew in space again.

1869
02:07:26,194 --> 02:07:29,266
Nor did Jack Swigert,
who left the astronaut corps...

1870
02:07:29,354 --> 02:07:32,312
and was elected to Congress
from the state of Colorado.

1871
02:07:32,394 --> 02:07:36,148
But he died of cancer before
he was able to take office.

1872
02:07:36,194 --> 02:07:40,267
Ken Mattingly orbited the moon
as command module pilot of Apollo 16...

1873
02:07:40,314 --> 02:07:43,989
and flew the space shuttle,
having never gotten the measles.

1874
02:07:44,034 --> 02:07:49,267
Gene Kranz retired as Director
of Flight Operations just not long ago.

1875
02:07:49,354 --> 02:07:52,107
And many other members of Mission
Control have gone on to other things,

1876
02:07:52,154 --> 02:07:54,065
but some are still there.

1877
02:07:54,154 --> 02:07:56,748
And as for me...

1878
02:07:56,794 --> 02:08:01,549
the seven extraordinary days
of Apollo 13 were my last in space.

1879
02:08:01,594 --> 02:08:06,031
l watched other men walk on the moon
and return safely,

1880
02:08:06,074 --> 02:08:10,545
all from the confines of Mission Control
and our house in Houston.

1881
02:08:10,634 --> 02:08:13,706
l sometimes catch myself
looking up at the moon,

1882
02:08:13,754 --> 02:08:17,064
remembering the changes
of fortune in our long voyage,

1883
02:08:17,114 --> 02:08:22,347
thinking of the thousands of people who
worked to bring the three of us home.

1884
02:08:22,394 --> 02:08:25,386
l look up at the moon
and wonder...

1885
02:08:25,434 --> 02:08:27,948
when will we be going back...

1886
02:08:27,994 --> 02:08:31,464
and who will that be?
