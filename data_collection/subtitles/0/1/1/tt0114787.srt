1
00:00:19,917 --> 00:00:22,625
To our fathers 
 and their children...

2
00:00:22,792 --> 00:00:26,458
Once upon a time, 
 there was a country...

3
00:00:26,583 --> 00:00:29,708
and its capital was Belgrade.

4
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:32,083
April 6, 1941...

5
00:01:06,417 --> 00:01:08,875
I'll kill them, my friend!

6
00:01:16,333 --> 00:01:17,667
Careful, my friend!

7
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,333
I'll kill them!

8
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:43,833
Don't, it's dangerous!

9
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:56,625
lvan, my brother!

10
00:01:56,792 --> 00:01:58,917
The Vice-President spoke 
 of increased cooperation

11
00:01:59,083 --> 00:02:02,000
between the two nations 
 of Yugoslavia.

12
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:17,375
That's my brother...

13
00:02:17,542 --> 00:02:19,833
and his best friend, Blacky!

14
00:02:19,958 --> 00:02:23,000
Hooligans! Hooligans!

15
00:02:23,125 --> 00:02:30,333
What can I do? 
 They're all I... have.

16
00:02:39,625 --> 00:02:41,708
Marko!

17
00:02:41,875 --> 00:02:46,875
Come in for a cup of coffee.

18
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:50,833
Impossible, man, I'm in a hurry! 
 My friend's tired!

19
00:02:50,958 --> 00:02:52,833
I'm tired...

20
00:02:52,958 --> 00:02:56,375
I'll buy you lunch tomorrow 
 at "The Russian Tsar"!

21
00:03:23,958 --> 00:03:26,333
Get off that horse 
 and get in the house!

22
00:03:26,458 --> 00:03:29,292
Vera, I'm a free man, you hear?

23
00:03:29,417 --> 00:03:31,250
A free man? 
 You're kidding!

24
00:03:31,417 --> 00:03:33,292
Damn it!

25
00:03:33,458 --> 00:03:35,958
Vera, I have something important 
 to tell you.

26
00:03:36,083 --> 00:03:37,083
Listen...

27
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,500
What?

28
00:03:38,667 --> 00:03:40,542
Don't be angry...

29
00:03:40,667 --> 00:03:43,167
We enrolled Petar 
 in the Communist Party.

30
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,167
A whore-house rather!

31
00:03:45,292 --> 00:03:46,958
He's one of us now.

32
00:03:47,125 --> 00:03:48,125
Get inside!

33
00:03:48,292 --> 00:03:50,917
Okay, just one last word 
 to my friend.

34
00:03:51,083 --> 00:03:54,458
Get inside. 
 I have to sort things out with him.

35
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:57,417
See who I have to live with!

36
00:03:57,583 --> 00:03:59,167
I love you. 
 Let me kiss you.

37
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:00,500
Not on the lips, fucker!

38
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:03,667
Blacky! 
 Get in the house!

39
00:04:03,792 --> 00:04:05,667
She's like this every morning!

40
00:04:05,792 --> 00:04:10,875
I'll leave you, 
 just like Marko's wife left him.

41
00:04:11,042 --> 00:04:12,250
I'm a free man...

42
00:04:46,292 --> 00:04:49,208
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo...

43
00:05:08,208 --> 00:05:11,042
Part One - The War

44
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,583
In the attic, 
 a small apartment...

45
00:06:10,125 --> 00:06:11,583
On the wall...

46
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,542
Looloo... Breakfast!

47
00:06:18,583 --> 00:06:23,167
A small clock on the wall...

48
00:06:23,292 --> 00:06:27,875
Is ticking... tick-tock...

49
00:06:28,750 --> 00:06:31,750
In the attic... an apartment...

50
00:06:31,875 --> 00:06:36,333
Does your mother obey you?

51
00:08:43,292 --> 00:08:44,625
Soni!

52
00:10:16,667 --> 00:10:23,792
That's it! Do it! Go on!

53
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:26,417
- Let go! 
 - The best is yet to come!

54
00:10:31,417 --> 00:10:33,167
Wait!

55
00:11:09,542 --> 00:11:12,375
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

56
00:11:14,333 --> 00:11:15,833
How can you keep eating?

57
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,833
I can and that's that.

58
00:11:24,375 --> 00:11:26,708
How can you, 
 with all these bombs?

59
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,458
Out of spite!

60
00:11:29,917 --> 00:11:31,708
You want me to die hungry?

61
00:11:41,625 --> 00:11:43,500
My shoes!

62
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:46,417
Not my shoes!

63
00:11:52,333 --> 00:11:53,333
You fat horse!

64
00:12:09,875 --> 00:12:11,083
I've had enough.

65
00:12:21,042 --> 00:12:22,083
That does it!

66
00:12:24,125 --> 00:12:26,583
They're bombing my city!

67
00:12:32,542 --> 00:12:34,167
Raiding my city!

68
00:12:34,917 --> 00:12:36,333
My own city!

69
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:38,958
Where are you going, Blacky?

70
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:44,208
To "greet" the fucking criminals 
 who've come to destroy my city!

71
00:12:44,333 --> 00:12:46,167
- I know where you're going! 
 - You do?

72
00:12:46,292 --> 00:12:47,375
I know!

73
00:12:48,292 --> 00:12:50,292
To see that whore!

74
00:12:50,417 --> 00:12:53,417
What whore? 
 You're crazy, you really are.

75
00:12:53,542 --> 00:12:54,625
That actress.

76
00:12:54,792 --> 00:12:56,708
What? 
 I'm defending my country!

77
00:12:56,875 --> 00:12:58,542
- Don't lie! 
 - Vera!

78
00:12:58,708 --> 00:12:59,750
You're defending that whore!

79
00:12:59,917 --> 00:13:03,167
God, it's impossible to have 
 a serious talk with you!

80
00:13:09,042 --> 00:13:10,333
What are you saying?

81
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,167
You get on my nerves!

82
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,625
Here it is!

83
00:13:14,750 --> 00:13:18,667
I'm saying what the whole town 
 is saying.

84
00:13:19,958 --> 00:13:21,125
What is it, my love?

85
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,708
You never leave that theatre!

86
00:13:24,875 --> 00:13:27,667
You're in that theatre every night.

87
00:13:27,792 --> 00:13:30,000
I know, I love the theatre.

88
00:13:30,167 --> 00:13:31,792
You love the theatre?

89
00:13:32,167 --> 00:13:34,208
You love the theatre!

90
00:13:34,375 --> 00:13:36,667
So? What's so strange about that?

91
00:13:36,792 --> 00:13:40,708
You love that whore, not the theatre!

92
00:13:40,875 --> 00:13:42,750
If you weren't pregnant...

93
00:13:42,875 --> 00:13:45,292
You'd what? 
 You lying creep!

94
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,958
- Me? 
 - Yes, you!

95
00:13:47,125 --> 00:13:49,208
You, you scum!

96
00:13:50,958 --> 00:13:53,167
What is it? What?

97
00:13:57,208 --> 00:13:58,542
Shame on you, Vera!

98
00:14:01,250 --> 00:14:02,292
Blacky!

99
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:07,917
What's happening?

100
00:14:15,667 --> 00:14:22,792
Don't cry! 
 I'll build you a new zoo.

101
00:14:22,917 --> 00:14:23,917
Come on...

102
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:25,958
Look...

103
00:14:32,667 --> 00:14:33,875
Get lost!

104
00:14:34,708 --> 00:14:36,750
The survivors will be eaten, 
 can't you see?

105
00:14:37,417 --> 00:14:38,417
Here's some money.

106
00:14:39,958 --> 00:14:41,750
Buy some milk for the baby monkey.

107
00:14:41,875 --> 00:14:45,500
Come on, stop crying. 
 The Germans will make fun of you.

108
00:15:55,708 --> 00:16:00,167
National Theatre 
 Clearance Team

109
00:16:15,208 --> 00:16:16,750
Working hard, artists?

110
00:16:16,875 --> 00:16:17,917
You bet!

111
00:16:21,708 --> 00:16:23,500
Bato, sweets!

112
00:16:23,625 --> 00:16:24,958
Uncle Blacky!

113
00:16:30,167 --> 00:16:32,375
Are you avoiding me? 
 Let's not play games.

114
00:16:32,542 --> 00:16:34,000
You're dead right!

115
00:16:34,167 --> 00:16:35,208
What do you mean?

116
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,750
You know very well 
 what I mean!

117
00:16:37,917 --> 00:16:38,917
No, I don't.

118
00:16:39,042 --> 00:16:40,083
I don't!

119
00:16:40,208 --> 00:16:43,083
You want me and Bato 
 in a prison camp?

120
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:44,250
What?

121
00:16:44,417 --> 00:16:47,000
The whole city is talking about it. 
 You thief!

122
00:16:47,125 --> 00:16:48,125
Me?

123
00:16:48,292 --> 00:16:49,292
What's the town saying?

124
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:51,167
Don't try to act stupid.

125
00:16:51,292 --> 00:16:54,917
You steal people's gold and money. 
 You steal!

126
00:16:55,083 --> 00:16:56,833
I only steal from the rich...

127
00:16:56,958 --> 00:16:59,208
what they stole from the poor!

128
00:16:59,375 --> 00:17:00,833
- Stop it... 
 - You stop it!

129
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:02,208
Working hard?

130
00:17:05,500 --> 00:17:06,792
Do you love me?

131
00:17:08,833 --> 00:17:10,000
Well, yes.

132
00:17:10,167 --> 00:17:11,167
Come on, give me a kiss!

133
00:17:18,292 --> 00:17:20,708
You love me! 
 I've been looking for you for days.

134
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:21,833
I'm scared.

135
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,667
You get on my nerves!

136
00:17:23,833 --> 00:17:26,167
You get on mine! 
 Have you seen this?

137
00:17:28,333 --> 00:17:29,542
You're a wanted man.

138
00:17:31,833 --> 00:17:33,083
Ten thousand!

139
00:17:33,208 --> 00:17:35,083
Ten thousand for my life! 
 Rubbish!

140
00:17:36,792 --> 00:17:37,875
Franz!

141
00:17:43,500 --> 00:17:44,583
Franz?

142
00:17:50,292 --> 00:17:52,083
Frulein Zovko...

143
00:17:52,208 --> 00:17:53,625
Oh, Franz! 
 Good morning.

144
00:17:55,917 --> 00:17:57,417
I've been waiting.

145
00:17:58,958 --> 00:18:01,542
We have a table waiting 
 at "The Russian Tsar".

146
00:18:01,708 --> 00:18:03,542
Yes... and my brother?

147
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:08,417
Seisenberger, do me a favour. 
 Take this "vehicle" and follow us.

148
00:18:08,542 --> 00:18:09,583
But carefully!

149
00:18:19,958 --> 00:18:21,667
Franz...

150
00:18:22,083 --> 00:18:24,208
Ivan, open up!

151
00:18:26,917 --> 00:18:30,083
Stay there by the door 
 and don't move!

152
00:18:30,208 --> 00:18:33,667
lvan! 
 My God, it stinks in here!

153
00:18:33,792 --> 00:18:35,750
Vera, take a seat!

154
00:18:37,625 --> 00:18:41,958
My brother's like Noah 
 saving the world after the flood.

155
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:44,208
Don't move and keep quiet!

156
00:19:06,333 --> 00:19:09,792
What are you doing?

157
00:19:09,958 --> 00:19:11,500
Shame on you!

158
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:15,625
Always hanging yourself!

159
00:19:15,792 --> 00:19:17,833
My God...

160
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:38,542
I've had enough of this life...

161
00:19:38,667 --> 00:19:40,750
Enough? Instead of helping me 
 and being a hero,

162
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:45,792
you hang yourself like a sissy! 
 Shame on you!

163
00:19:45,958 --> 00:19:47,500
An announcement from the Gestapo

164
00:19:47,667 --> 00:19:51,333
to citizens of Belgrade 
 and other towns.

165
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:56,667
Bandits robbed a train 
 full of arms and munitions last night.

166
00:19:56,833 --> 00:19:59,417
The attack was the work 
 of the Communist criminals,

167
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:04,625
Petar Popara, known as Blacky, 
 and Marko Dren.

168
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:07,583
What have you done?

169
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:11,833
Nothing. Last night, 
 we roughed up a few thieves.

170
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,667
Marko, oh Lord...

171
00:20:18,333 --> 00:20:20,375
Someone ratted on us.

172
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:24,125
Some bastard squealer 
 gave our names!

173
00:20:24,792 --> 00:20:26,375
Our comrades were arrested.

174
00:20:26,542 --> 00:20:30,500
Was Blacky arrested? 
 Taken in?

175
00:20:30,667 --> 00:20:33,000
Arrested, my ass, 
 just as they'll never catch me.

176
00:20:33,417 --> 00:20:34,583
Come on, hurry up!

177
00:20:36,208 --> 00:20:38,833
Why do I have to come?

178
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,042
Because you're my brother.

179
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:46,333
Let him go!

180
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,333
Come on, people!

181
00:21:18,417 --> 00:21:20,708
No, it's nothing! 
 I can manage!

182
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,500
Who is it?

183
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:35,625
It's me, grandad!

184
00:21:35,792 --> 00:21:37,292
Who is it?

185
00:21:37,417 --> 00:21:39,000
It's me! Marko!

186
00:21:39,542 --> 00:21:40,917
Who?

187
00:21:41,083 --> 00:21:42,542
Marko, for God's sake!

188
00:21:43,958 --> 00:21:44,958
Who?

189
00:21:45,875 --> 00:21:47,125
It's me, Marko! Open up!

190
00:21:47,292 --> 00:21:48,292
It's you, Marko!

191
00:21:48,417 --> 00:21:49,458
Yes, it's me.

192
00:21:49,917 --> 00:21:55,667
Come on in! 
 The Germans could be here any minute!

193
00:21:55,792 --> 00:21:59,375
Go downstairs, 
 I'll take care of your stuff later.

194
00:21:59,500 --> 00:22:01,792
The cellar's behind the stove.

195
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:08,417
Let them through! 
 Come on!

196
00:22:11,875 --> 00:22:13,958
Where are you taking 
 those animals?

197
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:16,750
It's not a zoo down there, 
 it's a shelter for humans!

198
00:22:22,250 --> 00:22:23,292
I'm closing!

199
00:22:41,417 --> 00:22:42,833
This is horrible!

200
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:45,500
Horrible!

201
00:23:22,083 --> 00:23:25,167
Where are you now, Blacky, 
 you bastard?

202
00:23:36,375 --> 00:23:38,542
Has it st... st...

203
00:23:38,667 --> 00:23:40,625
Yes, it's started, it's started!

204
00:23:40,750 --> 00:23:44,458
It's started! 
 Grandad!

205
00:23:45,625 --> 00:23:47,292
Marko!

206
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,375
Blacky's wife

207
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:58,292
...is giving birth! 
 - Out of the way!

208
00:23:58,417 --> 00:24:01,833
Please, quickly!

209
00:24:01,958 --> 00:24:07,042
Bring some water, 
 a sheet, any white piece of cloth...

210
00:24:07,167 --> 00:24:10,000
Quickly! It's coming!

211
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:11,750
Don't worry.

212
00:24:14,750 --> 00:24:18,583
Is everything all right?

213
00:24:18,708 --> 00:24:20,917
It will be, but I need more light.

214
00:24:27,375 --> 00:24:32,458
Right, lift up the bicycle! 
 Come on, higher!

215
00:25:09,917 --> 00:25:11,000
lvan!

216
00:25:17,417 --> 00:25:18,958
I don't feel well.

217
00:25:19,917 --> 00:25:23,542
Everything will be fine.

218
00:25:23,667 --> 00:25:29,167
No, it won't. It won't.

219
00:25:32,917 --> 00:25:34,958
If anything happens to me...

220
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,250
call him Jovan.

221
00:25:49,375 --> 00:25:51,208
Vera!

222
00:25:57,542 --> 00:25:59,708
3 years later, 
 Belgrade was suffering

223
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,208
an open fracture of its soul...

224
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:21,417
Stop, stop, 
 swift waters of the lbar

225
00:26:26,542 --> 00:26:34,667
Why are you in such a hurry

226
00:26:43,500 --> 00:26:44,542
All together!

227
00:26:44,708 --> 00:26:50,500
I have my sorrows too

228
00:26:56,500 --> 00:27:03,208
Deeper than you may know

229
00:27:04,375 --> 00:27:08,208
The drinks are on me. 
 It's my son's birthday!

230
00:27:11,042 --> 00:27:13,083
Here's my Jovan! 
 Look at him!

231
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,375
Handsome lad, Blacky! 
 Congratulations!

232
00:27:16,542 --> 00:27:18,292
He will be, Mustafa!

233
00:27:18,458 --> 00:27:22,417
I'll send him to school in Moscow 
 to be an officer,

234
00:27:22,542 --> 00:27:25,708
not a thief like you. 
 You motherfucking crook!

235
00:27:28,292 --> 00:27:29,958
We're partners.

236
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,208
But for how long?

237
00:27:34,083 --> 00:27:35,083
What's up?

238
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:37,917
Are you thieves getting jumpy?

239
00:27:38,042 --> 00:27:39,042
My friend!

240
00:27:39,500 --> 00:27:43,833
Happy birthday to your Jovan, 
 my friend!

241
00:27:45,333 --> 00:27:47,083
My good old friend!

242
00:27:47,292 --> 00:27:50,250
Look at him. 
 He's my spitting image!

243
00:27:50,375 --> 00:27:52,250
With a hint of Vera.

244
00:27:52,417 --> 00:27:54,292
You think so?

245
00:27:54,417 --> 00:27:55,500
What kept you?

246
00:27:55,625 --> 00:27:58,375
There's a traitor among us. 
 We've got problems.

247
00:27:58,542 --> 00:27:59,667
Those three are here.

248
00:27:59,792 --> 00:28:01,000
I saw them. Hang around.

249
00:28:03,583 --> 00:28:05,625
Sorry to keep you waiting.

250
00:28:06,917 --> 00:28:12,708
Good evening!

251
00:28:12,833 --> 00:28:15,208
If you please, gentlemen...

252
00:28:15,333 --> 00:28:17,292
I'm doing this for your own good.

253
00:28:20,875 --> 00:28:22,167
Gentlemen, please...

254
00:28:37,125 --> 00:28:38,833
Franz!

255
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:43,375
Flowers for Natalija!

256
00:28:44,750 --> 00:28:46,542
He kills us and fucks her!

257
00:28:48,208 --> 00:28:49,500
Excuse me.

258
00:28:52,250 --> 00:28:54,292
Get me the biggest bouquet 
 you can find.

259
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:55,458
Sure.

260
00:28:57,458 --> 00:29:00,000
- What about the priest? 
 - All arranged.

261
00:29:00,167 --> 00:29:01,250
Perfect...

262
00:29:02,583 --> 00:29:04,792
My friend, 
 there'll be a wedding!

263
00:29:06,792 --> 00:29:09,000
Now let's play fair.

264
00:29:09,167 --> 00:29:13,958
Here's my gun, give me yours. 
 That's fair.

265
00:29:15,417 --> 00:29:19,417
This is gold. See it? 
 This is gold, right?

266
00:29:19,542 --> 00:29:23,750
How much did the gold bring in? 
 Look at it!

267
00:29:23,875 --> 00:29:26,917
How much did it bring in?

268
00:29:27,042 --> 00:29:28,417
Look at it!

269
00:29:28,583 --> 00:29:30,958
How much for the gold?

270
00:29:31,583 --> 00:29:33,208
200,000!

271
00:29:33,375 --> 00:29:36,750
200,000? 
 Mustafa, you said 120,000.

272
00:29:36,875 --> 00:29:38,333
Never mind.

273
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:43,000
Now tell me where the weapons are 
 and we're done.

274
00:29:43,125 --> 00:29:46,708
I swear on my mother's grave, 
 the Germans took them.

275
00:29:46,875 --> 00:29:48,375
Leave your mother out of this!

276
00:29:56,125 --> 00:29:57,375
Motherfucker!

277
00:29:58,750 --> 00:30:02,875
You steal my money? 
 I rob banks, jewellery stores,

278
00:30:03,042 --> 00:30:04,958
and you fuckers steal my money!

279
00:30:10,667 --> 00:30:13,000
You dirty fucking thieves!

280
00:30:13,125 --> 00:30:15,167
I'll kill you all, you bastards!

281
00:30:15,292 --> 00:30:20,333
I'll clean Belgrade 
 of scum like you!

282
00:30:20,458 --> 00:30:25,000
Our comrades are shot in the woods, 
 they eat roots and you steal...

283
00:30:25,125 --> 00:30:27,417
You've gone crazy!

284
00:30:32,292 --> 00:30:35,625
No, guys, 
 we don't play this way...

285
00:30:35,750 --> 00:30:38,000
Hold these, honey, please.

286
00:30:44,333 --> 00:30:46,083
Faster and louder!

287
00:30:52,708 --> 00:30:55,833
Here I come, my friend! 
 Hang on!

288
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:18,458
Watch out!

289
00:31:26,208 --> 00:31:27,875
Here I come!

290
00:31:41,208 --> 00:31:42,833
Not in my ear!

291
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:51,000
Left! Left! Left!

292
00:32:00,333 --> 00:32:03,667
I have to tell you something, 
 you being the Party Secretary...

293
00:32:05,167 --> 00:32:07,875
If anything, 
 it'll be these thieves and criminals

294
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:09,542
who'll cost us our heads.

295
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:14,000
Right. We rob stores to buy 
 arms and food for our comrades.

296
00:32:14,125 --> 00:32:16,708
And the bastards steal from us!

297
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:21,167
"I'll kill myself.

298
00:32:21,250 --> 00:32:23,833
"You say you'll kill yourself.

299
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,375
"But you won't do it.

300
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:29,042
"Are you so sure?

301
00:32:29,167 --> 00:32:31,625
"Do you think a man can live..."

302
00:32:31,792 --> 00:32:33,750
Quiet!

303
00:32:33,917 --> 00:32:37,958
"...if he has nothing 
 and nobody to live for?

304
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:41,000
"Are you capitulating?

305
00:32:41,125 --> 00:32:43,958
"No, I suggest

306
00:32:44,125 --> 00:32:47,333
"that we make peace."

307
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,042
He's entranced by her!

308
00:32:51,542 --> 00:32:55,917
I'll kill him, I swear! 
 The other actors don't interest him!

309
00:32:56,042 --> 00:32:59,250
I think the Captain's excellent.

310
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,417
- Really? 
 - Yes, look at him!

311
00:33:00,542 --> 00:33:02,417
Quiet!

312
00:33:25,625 --> 00:33:28,458
Hands off. 
 This is a theatre, watch the show!

313
00:33:31,958 --> 00:33:33,625
Good evening.

314
00:33:35,458 --> 00:33:37,083
"Promise to tell me

315
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:43,917
"the truth 
 and I'll forgive you in advance.

316
00:33:44,083 --> 00:33:46,875
"Is Berta my child?

317
00:33:47,042 --> 00:33:51,042
"I cannot assume the guilt

318
00:33:51,167 --> 00:33:55,167
"for a deed I didn't commit."

319
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:03,792
Get out!

320
00:34:08,417 --> 00:34:10,000
Have you no shame?

321
00:34:10,125 --> 00:34:16,167
"Is Berta my child?"

322
00:34:16,292 --> 00:34:18,458
"Is Berta my child?"

323
00:34:18,583 --> 00:34:21,792
"Is Berta my child?"

324
00:34:21,917 --> 00:34:23,042
I'm coming.

325
00:34:25,458 --> 00:34:26,750
Bato!

326
00:34:26,917 --> 00:34:27,958
Quiet!

327
00:34:28,125 --> 00:34:29,125
Uncle Blacky!

328
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,625
Natalija is the best!

329
00:34:30,750 --> 00:34:32,125
She is the best!

330
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,333
Franz!

331
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,792
- This is a scandal. 
 - I know...

332
00:35:13,167 --> 00:35:15,417
Captain!

333
00:35:15,542 --> 00:35:18,500
Good evening, madam.

334
00:35:18,667 --> 00:35:19,667
Captain...

335
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,000
Just a moment.

336
00:35:22,292 --> 00:35:23,958
I am...

337
00:35:24,417 --> 00:35:26,417
Berta's father.

338
00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:31,833
I am the father of your child.

339
00:35:32,542 --> 00:35:33,583
Please...

340
00:35:36,833 --> 00:35:37,875
Do you understand?

341
00:35:49,750 --> 00:35:53,000
Tie us together. Quickly!

342
00:35:55,583 --> 00:35:57,875
I now have my Laura with me.

343
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:00,042
We're in love.

344
00:36:00,167 --> 00:36:01,333
Hurry!

345
00:36:01,458 --> 00:36:05,208
We're leaving your house 
 so we can live together.

346
00:36:06,292 --> 00:36:07,667
Please don't be angry.

347
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:10,250
- Finished? 
 - Yes.

348
00:36:10,417 --> 00:36:12,500
Thank you, captain.

349
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,708
I know this actor.

350
00:36:14,833 --> 00:36:18,958
I know him... 
 Where on earth from?

351
00:36:19,083 --> 00:36:20,708
Good-bye, captain.

352
00:36:23,583 --> 00:36:26,500
You act for Germans, 
 you motherfucker!

353
00:36:34,750 --> 00:36:36,417
Wonderful actor, my colleague!

354
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:54,083
Are these the mains?

355
00:37:14,542 --> 00:37:16,833
Keep to your seats!

356
00:37:24,292 --> 00:37:26,167
Hands up, traitor!

357
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,792
Hands up!

358
00:37:28,917 --> 00:37:30,750
Is this the curtain?

359
00:37:30,917 --> 00:37:33,583
It is but please, sir...

360
00:37:41,208 --> 00:37:43,833
Uncle Blacky! Sis!

361
00:37:45,167 --> 00:37:48,125
Uncle Blacky! 
 Charge!

362
00:37:54,833 --> 00:37:56,667
You want my sister?

363
00:37:56,792 --> 00:38:01,417
Well, you won't have her. 
 You won't!

364
00:38:06,792 --> 00:38:09,000
Come on! 
 Hands up, my friend!

365
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,375
They'll kill my brother!

366
00:38:42,042 --> 00:38:45,250
Blow on that horn! 
 I don't get married every night!

367
00:38:46,125 --> 00:38:47,292
Congratulations!

368
00:38:47,417 --> 00:38:49,917
Okay, Golub. Where's the priest?

369
00:38:50,083 --> 00:38:51,667
I sent a boy to fetch him.

370
00:38:51,833 --> 00:38:53,250
Congratulations, miss.

371
00:38:53,375 --> 00:38:54,833
I'm not getting married!

372
00:38:54,958 --> 00:38:57,792
Yes, you are. 
 You just don't know it yet.

373
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:03,708
So, I ruined your life by killing Franz. 
 Thank you, Natalija!

374
00:39:03,833 --> 00:39:06,000
Who gets Bato's medicine, 
 you or Franz?

375
00:39:07,333 --> 00:39:10,417
- You only bring me stolen gold! 
 - From traitors.

376
00:39:11,667 --> 00:39:13,208
Come to your senses.

377
00:39:13,375 --> 00:39:14,625
Listen to me...

378
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:17,083
I've never loved anyone so much.

379
00:39:17,208 --> 00:39:20,417
But respect some rules. 
 No collaborating with the enemy!

380
00:39:20,542 --> 00:39:21,583
Right!

381
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,542
What do you mean? 
 I'm just an actress.

382
00:39:26,042 --> 00:39:28,667
The bakeries are working!

383
00:39:28,833 --> 00:39:30,958
Yes, but you're not a baker.

384
00:39:31,125 --> 00:39:32,875
You don't sell pies.

385
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,500
You sell your soul.

386
00:39:34,625 --> 00:39:38,375
I personally will judge those 
 who sell their soul.

387
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:42,333
First, I'll kill the manager 
 of your theatre.

388
00:39:42,875 --> 00:39:46,250
I'll strangle him with my bare hands... 
 because I love the theatre!

389
00:40:07,917 --> 00:40:10,083
Congratulations, Mr. Blacky!

390
00:40:24,042 --> 00:40:28,333
Will this dinner eat us 
 before we eat it?

391
00:40:29,292 --> 00:40:31,542
Get that fish grilled properly.

392
00:40:31,667 --> 00:40:33,750
No problem!

393
00:40:35,875 --> 00:40:39,417
Have you no shame? 
 Others help wounded partisans

394
00:40:39,542 --> 00:40:42,208
while you perform 
 for the bastards!

395
00:40:45,625 --> 00:40:47,042
It hurts!

396
00:40:47,167 --> 00:40:48,833
So now it hurts you!

397
00:40:50,375 --> 00:40:51,500
I love you.

398
00:40:54,667 --> 00:40:56,000
Golub!

399
00:40:57,750 --> 00:40:59,083
Grill it!

400
00:40:59,625 --> 00:41:01,625
Follow me, I'm going for a pee.

401
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:04,875
Watch my bride, my friend.

402
00:41:06,042 --> 00:41:07,667
Let's go!

403
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:24,833
Marko!

404
00:41:36,625 --> 00:41:38,167
Come on! Follow me!

405
00:41:48,167 --> 00:41:49,625
I don't want to!

406
00:42:05,542 --> 00:42:07,583
I don't want to get married!

407
00:42:09,042 --> 00:42:12,167
Golub, I won't leave the partisans 
 to sort you all out.

408
00:42:12,292 --> 00:42:13,625
There's no need.

409
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,167
You may not know this

410
00:42:16,292 --> 00:42:21,042
but he's not 
 an electrical engineer at all.

411
00:42:22,917 --> 00:42:27,250
No, he's a common electrician. 
 A pole-man!

412
00:42:28,750 --> 00:42:30,875
He spent his whole life on poles,

413
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:33,500
with pliers and cutters.

414
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:38,875
I'm the one who got him down 
 and asked him: "Comrade,

415
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:41,458
"will you join our side?" 
 "Yes," he said.

416
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:45,042
"Will you obey the rules

417
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:47,000
"and the orders?" 
 "Yes."

418
00:42:47,167 --> 00:42:48,375
Until...

419
00:42:48,500 --> 00:42:49,875
he got rich!

420
00:42:52,542 --> 00:42:53,542
Natalija!

421
00:42:58,292 --> 00:42:59,750
An electrician?

422
00:43:00,958 --> 00:43:02,583
A pole-man!

423
00:43:06,125 --> 00:43:10,667
Natalija, 
 you are our greatest actress

424
00:43:10,833 --> 00:43:14,500
and our suffering people 
 need you.

425
00:43:14,667 --> 00:43:19,833
And you need 
 a reasonable, intelligent,

426
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:22,000
educated man...

427
00:43:23,375 --> 00:43:24,500
An intellectual!

428
00:43:26,417 --> 00:43:28,208
You're right!

429
00:43:39,958 --> 00:43:43,417
Comrade Leka will bring you 
 to the disciplinary committee.

430
00:43:43,583 --> 00:43:47,125
We expected the guns a week ago. 
 Where are they?

431
00:43:47,292 --> 00:43:51,083
On the boat. 
 As soon as I get married, off we go!

432
00:43:51,208 --> 00:43:53,708
They can hear the music 
 in Belgrade!

433
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:55,750
Good! 
 It's Blacky's wedding.

434
00:43:55,917 --> 00:43:57,667
We've had enough crying.

435
00:44:00,958 --> 00:44:03,458
Are these arms or what?

436
00:44:08,583 --> 00:44:10,167
Once the priest marries me,

437
00:44:10,708 --> 00:44:12,417
I'll be at the White Rock 
 before you.

438
00:44:12,542 --> 00:44:15,917
Comrade Tito!

439
00:44:16,708 --> 00:44:21,833
When will you reach Uzice

440
00:44:31,917 --> 00:44:34,250
"Your hands, so white

441
00:44:34,875 --> 00:44:39,083
"So tender, so soft 
 As the wings of a bird

442
00:44:39,250 --> 00:44:43,292
"Oh, to see them fly 
 and land on my face..."

443
00:45:02,917 --> 00:45:03,917
That's enough!

444
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,333
Get out!

445
00:45:09,667 --> 00:45:11,417
What are you doing to me?

446
00:45:11,583 --> 00:45:13,875
We're just talking 
 about the theatre.

447
00:45:14,708 --> 00:45:16,167
What?

448
00:45:16,833 --> 00:45:19,375
I'll kill myself, I swear!

449
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:21,333
Don't, my friend!

450
00:45:24,583 --> 00:45:28,167
You know, 
 I killed two men because of her!

451
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:29,292
I know.

452
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:31,625
Why do this to me?

453
00:45:31,750 --> 00:45:33,583
- As for you... 
 - It wasn't me!

454
00:45:33,708 --> 00:45:35,208
Wasn't you?

455
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:36,750
It was me, then?

456
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:48,042
Are you my best friend?

457
00:45:48,167 --> 00:45:49,625
I'm your best friend.

458
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:51,917
I didn't hear. 
 Are you my best friend?

459
00:45:52,042 --> 00:45:53,083
I'm your best friend.

460
00:45:54,375 --> 00:45:56,000
Whose wedding is this?

461
00:45:56,167 --> 00:45:59,458
Ours, my love! Our wedding!

462
00:45:59,583 --> 00:46:01,208
Yours, my friend.

463
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,750
- Our wedding, sweetheart. 
 - Ours, my love!

464
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:14,333
You wanted a ride, did you? 
 Well, giddy-up, you stud!

465
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,792
Where's the priest?

466
00:46:44,542 --> 00:46:46,625
He'll be here any minute now.

467
00:46:47,708 --> 00:46:53,083
Is it moonlight at noon

468
00:46:57,625 --> 00:47:01,875
Is it sunshine at midnight

469
00:47:05,417 --> 00:47:09,042
From the skies above 
 Light is beaming...

470
00:47:10,250 --> 00:47:12,375
The Germans! A catastrophe!

471
00:47:12,542 --> 00:47:17,042
Nobody knows, nobody knows

472
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:20,417
What is really shining

473
00:47:22,958 --> 00:47:26,833
The two of you 
 could make one good man!

474
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:30,167
You pest!

475
00:47:33,625 --> 00:47:37,208
Get out of the cars! 
 Spread out!

476
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:39,125
Left and right of the boat!

477
00:47:46,333 --> 00:47:48,333
Marko!

478
00:47:49,792 --> 00:47:51,958
Petar Popara!

479
00:47:52,792 --> 00:47:54,875
You fools!

480
00:47:55,958 --> 00:47:57,667
You can't play cat and mouse!

481
00:47:57,792 --> 00:47:58,875
Franz!

482
00:47:59,042 --> 00:48:01,208
Come out now!

483
00:48:02,250 --> 00:48:05,833
And bring Natalija with you 
 or I'll shoot you all!

484
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:09,375
How come? I killed him.

485
00:48:09,542 --> 00:48:10,583
You didn't.

486
00:48:10,750 --> 00:48:12,500
He wears a bullet-proof vest.

487
00:48:12,667 --> 00:48:14,333
Aim at his head next time.

488
00:48:14,500 --> 00:48:17,875
I'll smoke one more cigarette.

489
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:20,583
And then my patience runs out.

490
00:48:20,750 --> 00:48:23,792
After that, 
 I want you out in the open.

491
00:48:25,458 --> 00:48:26,542
Do you hear me?

492
00:48:30,042 --> 00:48:31,542
Don't shoot!

493
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,750
Don't shoot!

494
00:48:42,750 --> 00:48:43,750
Catastrophe!

495
00:48:48,667 --> 00:48:50,417
My sweet saviour!

496
00:48:52,125 --> 00:48:53,250
My dearest...

497
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,958
Schulz, get out!

498
00:49:08,375 --> 00:49:09,958
Now let's send

499
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:13,417
this shit-load of criminals 
 back where they belong!

500
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:17,458
My little white dove!

501
00:49:29,375 --> 00:49:31,917
Have fun, you idiots!

502
00:49:32,833 --> 00:49:35,375
You won't forget me in a hurry!

503
00:49:48,792 --> 00:49:50,500
Shoot, my friend!

504
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:55,042
Golub, don't shoot!

505
00:49:56,333 --> 00:49:57,417
Catastrophe!

506
00:49:57,542 --> 00:49:59,583
Shoot, my friend!

507
00:50:12,500 --> 00:50:13,833
Where are the weapons, Blacky?

508
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:20,000
Where are the trains 
 with the weapons, bastard?

509
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:24,708
Treacherous swine!

510
00:50:29,458 --> 00:50:32,167
I'll fry Tito out of your head!

511
00:51:13,292 --> 00:51:14,333
Well?

512
00:51:15,625 --> 00:51:16,875
Is he talking?

513
00:51:17,917 --> 00:51:21,000
No. He just keeps cursing.

514
00:51:23,833 --> 00:51:25,042
Petar Popara!

515
00:51:25,208 --> 00:51:28,458
Fucking fascist motherfucker!

516
00:51:36,417 --> 00:51:37,750
You'll talk!

517
00:51:38,208 --> 00:51:41,250
Keep on raising the current.

518
00:51:43,792 --> 00:51:46,250
Marry uncle Blacky, sis.

519
00:51:46,375 --> 00:51:48,333
He's the greatest.

520
00:51:48,458 --> 00:51:49,625
Forget uncle Blacky!

521
00:51:49,792 --> 00:51:51,000
Here's Franz!

522
00:51:51,125 --> 00:51:52,750
Blacky's the greatest!

523
00:51:52,917 --> 00:51:54,083
Stop pestering me.

524
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,000
What did he say?

525
00:51:57,167 --> 00:52:01,292
He asked when he can be released.

526
00:52:03,125 --> 00:52:04,667
Next week, my boy.

527
00:52:06,667 --> 00:52:08,833
He can go 
 to a sanatorium in Austria.

528
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:11,375
A sanatorium in Austria?

529
00:52:11,500 --> 00:52:15,250
Yes, he'll be safe there.

530
00:52:15,417 --> 00:52:17,708
I can't help him here. 
 It's too dangerous.

531
00:52:25,667 --> 00:52:26,667
Good morning!

532
00:52:28,042 --> 00:52:29,208
Good morning!

533
00:52:31,917 --> 00:52:35,292
Did the kid vomit during the night?

534
00:52:37,792 --> 00:52:39,042
Yes.

535
00:52:40,208 --> 00:52:41,792
No.

536
00:52:41,958 --> 00:52:43,833
Did he...

537
00:52:45,625 --> 00:52:47,375
or didn't he?

538
00:52:48,750 --> 00:52:50,333
I don't know.

539
00:52:51,417 --> 00:52:53,083
Well, he didn't.

540
00:52:54,375 --> 00:52:56,083
Tell him

541
00:52:56,250 --> 00:52:57,542
that he must not worry. 
 Please, tell him...

542
00:53:05,708 --> 00:53:07,500
Burst him!

543
00:53:07,625 --> 00:53:09,542
Burst him like a paper bag!

544
00:53:11,500 --> 00:53:13,875
Let go of him!

545
00:53:14,042 --> 00:53:15,750
Like a bag!

546
00:53:15,917 --> 00:53:17,417
Burst him like a bag!

547
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:21,625
You killed my Franz!

548
00:53:31,792 --> 00:53:33,417
Is he dead?

549
00:53:35,042 --> 00:53:37,542
Not yet!

550
00:53:38,750 --> 00:53:41,250
Forgive me, Franz. I'm sorry.

551
00:53:51,792 --> 00:53:53,500
Damn your Franz! Come on.

552
00:54:01,250 --> 00:54:04,292
- What's wrong with this shit? 
 - Put it on level 5.

553
00:54:04,417 --> 00:54:06,208
It might kill him.

554
00:54:06,333 --> 00:54:07,833
Kill me... my ass!

555
00:54:07,958 --> 00:54:09,375
Let me try.

556
00:54:15,583 --> 00:54:16,750
It doesn't work.

557
00:54:22,500 --> 00:54:23,708
Switch it on.

558
00:54:35,750 --> 00:54:36,833
Hey, man,

559
00:54:37,000 --> 00:54:38,708
wake up!

560
00:54:38,833 --> 00:54:40,583
Good afternoon.

561
00:54:41,583 --> 00:54:44,792
Let's see what's going on.

562
00:54:49,583 --> 00:54:51,167
What's wrong?

563
00:54:51,333 --> 00:54:52,542
He tested the generator.

564
00:54:52,667 --> 00:54:54,083
Is it working?

565
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:56,292
Yes, he's dead!

566
00:54:56,458 --> 00:54:59,958
- That one didn't flinch. 
 - He's an electrician.

567
00:55:00,125 --> 00:55:01,292
An electrician?

568
00:55:02,083 --> 00:55:04,000
A pole-man!

569
00:55:17,333 --> 00:55:18,750
My friend...

570
00:55:19,042 --> 00:55:22,458
Give me a grenade. 
 If they catch me, I'll choose.

571
00:55:22,583 --> 00:55:24,792
Here you are. Let's go.

572
00:55:29,958 --> 00:55:31,583
Thank you, Marko.

573
00:55:35,542 --> 00:55:38,458
Those crazy people 
 are so sad...

574
00:55:38,625 --> 00:55:39,708
Indeed.

575
00:55:48,542 --> 00:55:50,875
We're all crazy, Natalija.

576
00:55:56,000 --> 00:56:00,542
We just haven't been... 
 diagnosed yet.

577
00:56:02,958 --> 00:56:04,833
Where's uncle Blacky?

578
00:56:05,833 --> 00:56:07,958
In the trunk, my boy.

579
00:56:08,083 --> 00:56:09,708
In the trunk?

580
00:56:17,542 --> 00:56:18,708
In the trunk?

581
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:21,542
Uncle Blacky!

582
00:56:28,125 --> 00:56:32,583
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

583
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:45,875
lvan!

584
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,583
Golub!

585
00:56:48,542 --> 00:56:50,667
Get some bandages ready! 
 Hang on, my friend!

586
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:54,333
Bring the bandages, 
 for fuck's sake!

587
00:56:54,500 --> 00:56:56,750
Come and help. Hold Jovan.

588
00:56:56,875 --> 00:56:57,958
Jovan!

589
00:56:59,375 --> 00:57:02,208
Fuck the monkey, help the man!

590
00:57:11,125 --> 00:57:12,333
Pedal faster.

591
00:57:12,458 --> 00:57:14,875
We need more light.

592
00:57:15,625 --> 00:57:17,083
Mind his leg!

593
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:20,875
God, Comrade Blacky, 
 what did they do to you?

594
00:57:21,000 --> 00:57:23,667
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

595
00:57:25,125 --> 00:57:27,000
Catastrophe!

596
00:57:27,125 --> 00:57:29,708
Jovan...

597
00:57:29,875 --> 00:57:30,958
Comrade Marko!

598
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:33,542
Call your grandad, 
 he'll cure him.

599
00:57:33,667 --> 00:57:35,625
The water from the well 
 is medicinal.

600
00:57:36,833 --> 00:57:37,958
Gently...

601
00:57:38,875 --> 00:57:41,167
Tell the comrades about the arms.

602
00:57:41,292 --> 00:57:43,583
Don't worry, I'll see to the weapons.

603
00:57:43,750 --> 00:57:45,250
Look at Jovan!

604
00:57:45,375 --> 00:57:47,125
Your son!

605
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:48,625
This is your dad.

606
00:57:48,792 --> 00:57:50,708
Show him his dad!

607
00:57:50,833 --> 00:57:56,125
Jovan! My son!

608
00:58:01,542 --> 00:58:04,458
Give your dad a kiss! 
 Kiss your dad!

609
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:45,708
This room is dedicated to me!

610
00:58:49,833 --> 00:58:51,250
My room!

611
00:58:52,208 --> 00:58:53,333
Right...

612
00:58:54,250 --> 00:58:56,042
Yes!

613
00:58:56,167 --> 00:59:00,750
This room and this house!

614
00:59:00,875 --> 00:59:06,125
And this country and the sky, 
 stars, rain, sun, moon and clouds...

615
00:59:07,208 --> 00:59:09,542
even when the sky is bright!

616
00:59:10,792 --> 00:59:11,833
It's all mine...

617
00:59:13,542 --> 00:59:15,750
Yes. All of it!

618
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:35,500
- Who's bombing us now? 
 - The Allies.

619
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:38,833
When it's not the Germans, 
 the Allies bomb us.

620
00:59:41,167 --> 00:59:42,167
Where are you going?

621
00:59:43,708 --> 00:59:44,833
To the cellar.

622
00:59:44,958 --> 00:59:46,000
Come to me!

623
00:59:46,542 --> 00:59:48,167
Come to me!

624
00:59:52,292 --> 00:59:53,625
Are you afraid?

625
00:59:55,000 --> 00:59:57,542
Not when I'm with you.

626
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:07,792
Drink up!

627
01:00:07,958 --> 01:00:09,667
You know I don't drink.

628
01:00:09,792 --> 01:00:11,583
Don't be afraid, drink!

629
01:00:19,125 --> 01:00:20,250
It's sweet, not strong!

630
01:00:20,375 --> 01:00:22,333
Indeed...

631
01:00:37,417 --> 01:00:41,792
"I do not know, my dear 
 If this is a dream

632
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,167
"What year it is 
 And what day

633
01:00:46,583 --> 01:00:49,708
"And I don't know, my dear 
 If I am yours

634
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:55,583
"Or if you are my dream"

635
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,750
Who did you write that for?

636
01:01:00,417 --> 01:01:01,833
Confess!

637
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:03,083
For you.

638
01:01:05,167 --> 01:01:06,167
You're lying!

639
01:01:09,417 --> 01:01:10,500
You're lying...

640
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:11,667
I'm not lying.

641
01:01:12,583 --> 01:01:13,667
You're lying.

642
01:01:13,833 --> 01:01:15,083
I never lie.

643
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:19,250
Never!

644
01:01:19,417 --> 01:01:20,583
Never!

645
01:01:23,208 --> 01:01:27,750
Marko, you lie so beautifully.

646
01:01:45,917 --> 01:01:47,333
Easter, April, 1944

647
01:01:47,458 --> 01:01:49,458
The Allied bombs destroyed

648
01:01:49,625 --> 01:01:52,333
what the Nazis 
 had left of Belgrade...

649
01:02:35,583 --> 01:02:39,542
Freedom!

650
01:03:45,500 --> 01:03:48,042
...from our homeland. 
 They try to tear out

651
01:03:48,167 --> 01:03:50,750
part of our body.

652
01:03:50,917 --> 01:03:53,875
With guns, we won the plebiscite!

653
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:56,292
With guns, 
 we defended freedom!

654
01:03:56,458 --> 01:03:58,500
With guns, 
 we'll defend Trieste!

655
01:04:38,625 --> 01:04:41,333
Part Two - The Cold War

656
01:04:41,750 --> 01:04:44,333
Years passed, Marko became

657
01:04:44,458 --> 01:04:46,833
a close collaborator of Tito.

658
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:49,250
In Belgrade, in 1961, he paid his debt

659
01:04:49,417 --> 01:04:51,208
to his great friend, Blacky.

660
01:05:09,875 --> 01:05:10,958
Comrade Marko...

661
01:05:11,083 --> 01:05:16,167
I must ask you again... 
 Could Comrade Natalija be in the film?

662
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:17,500
No.

663
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,833
But this film 
 is based on your memoirs

664
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:22,208
and she is our greatest actress!

665
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:27,250
Exactly. The film is dedicated 
 to the Revolution, not to us.

666
01:05:27,417 --> 01:05:31,333
Will you at least visit the set? 
 We'd be honoured.

667
01:05:31,458 --> 01:05:32,583
That we will do.

668
01:05:32,708 --> 01:05:35,167
Comrades...

669
01:05:35,333 --> 01:05:39,417
it is my honour to inaugurate 
 this Cultural Centre

670
01:05:39,583 --> 01:05:44,625
as well as unveil the statue 
 of our Hero, Petar Popara Blacky.

671
01:05:45,708 --> 01:05:48,917
Blacky symbolizes 
 our anti-fascist struggle!

672
01:05:49,625 --> 01:05:54,792
His image and work will forever 
 be remembered by us, his friends,

673
01:05:54,917 --> 01:05:56,500
his comrades in arms,

674
01:05:56,667 --> 01:06:00,125
and by future generations 
 who from early youth

675
01:06:00,250 --> 01:06:03,417
will come to this Cultural Centre

676
01:06:03,542 --> 01:06:06,583
to inspire themselves 
 with the ideas for which

677
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:11,667
our brother, our comrade, 
 our friend,

678
01:06:11,833 --> 01:06:16,583
our Blacky gave his life and youth.

679
01:06:34,833 --> 01:06:37,125
I'll use this occasion,

680
01:06:37,250 --> 01:06:41,708
even if it means taking your time, 
 to quote some lines

681
01:06:41,833 --> 01:06:45,333
from my last book of poems 
 on the Struggle for Freedom.

682
01:06:52,875 --> 01:06:58,083
"Why is the wind always blowing 
 when we remember our beloved?

683
01:06:59,667 --> 01:07:03,708
"Why does the wind beat the windows 
 and doors of our brothers?

684
01:07:04,875 --> 01:07:10,958
"Is the wind only blowing 
 or is the sky crying with us?"

685
01:07:12,375 --> 01:07:14,875
Petar Popara Blacky, our friend!

686
01:07:15,000 --> 01:07:16,667
We honour your memory!

687
01:07:16,833 --> 01:07:18,875
We honour his memory!

688
01:07:24,417 --> 01:07:27,208
Is it moonlight at noon

689
01:07:30,708 --> 01:07:32,917
Is it sunshine at midnight

690
01:07:35,417 --> 01:07:38,917
From the skies above 
 Light is beaming

691
01:07:39,042 --> 01:07:42,500
Nobody knows, nobody knows...

692
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:17,833
The Soviet divisions 
 are surrounded.

693
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:23,042
General von Kleist's armoured units 
 have breached their lines...

694
01:08:25,250 --> 01:08:27,583
That's it, girl!

695
01:08:35,458 --> 01:08:36,750
More light!

696
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,000
Dad!

697
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,250
Dad!

698
01:08:44,042 --> 01:08:45,042
Bring some water!

699
01:08:46,375 --> 01:08:47,542
What happened?

700
01:08:51,917 --> 01:08:53,333
Nothing, my friend.

701
01:08:53,458 --> 01:08:55,625
The Gestapo tortured me.

702
01:08:55,750 --> 01:08:57,167
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

703
01:08:57,292 --> 01:08:59,792
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

704
01:09:02,167 --> 01:09:06,583
Let me go out with you 
 and the war will be over in 3 days.

705
01:09:06,708 --> 01:09:09,167
- Not yet. 
 - Why wait?

706
01:09:09,292 --> 01:09:12,000
Tito orders you to wait.

707
01:09:12,125 --> 01:09:13,833
Tito?

708
01:09:18,750 --> 01:09:20,667
He said to me:

709
01:09:20,792 --> 01:09:25,000
"Give Blacky my regards 
 and tell him not to move.

710
01:09:25,125 --> 01:09:27,792
"He'll be precious to me 
 in the final battle."

711
01:09:27,958 --> 01:09:30,042
- He said that? 
 - Every word.

712
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:31,833
He sent you a watch.

713
01:09:39,625 --> 01:09:42,375
No, Marko, I can't...

714
01:09:42,500 --> 01:09:43,958
With a dedication!

715
01:09:44,083 --> 01:09:45,250
To me?

716
01:09:49,833 --> 01:09:51,083
To you.

717
01:10:00,667 --> 01:10:04,792
Comrade Tito

718
01:10:04,917 --> 01:10:09,792
we swear

719
01:10:09,958 --> 01:10:12,125
to you

720
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:16,875
We swear to you

721
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,458
Comrade Tito

722
01:10:20,625 --> 01:10:25,542
we swear to you

723
01:10:29,875 --> 01:10:35,042
That we won't

724
01:10:35,167 --> 01:10:37,833
abandon your path

725
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:11,583
Comrade Tito

726
01:11:11,708 --> 01:11:12,833
you, the hope of the people

727
01:11:17,958 --> 01:11:21,000
You're loved

728
01:11:21,167 --> 01:11:24,750
by the old

729
01:11:24,875 --> 01:11:29,833
and the young

730
01:11:30,000 --> 01:11:36,333
Comrade Tito

731
01:11:36,500 --> 01:11:42,500
our spring flower

732
01:11:42,625 --> 01:11:46,083
Serbia

733
01:11:46,208 --> 01:11:51,167
will not forget you

734
01:11:56,042 --> 01:12:01,292
A blue violet

735
01:12:01,458 --> 01:12:07,542
has bloomed

736
01:12:07,708 --> 01:12:14,375
On the pillow 
 where Tito's head rests

737
01:12:24,292 --> 01:12:26,708
Congratulations, Blacky!

738
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:31,667
Shake hands with Comrade Marko. 
 Not with me, with Comrade Marko.

739
01:12:37,292 --> 01:12:38,875
Are we having a bath?

740
01:12:41,583 --> 01:12:42,875
Aren't we?

741
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:44,083
Yes, a bath!

742
01:12:47,042 --> 01:12:49,167
What about our business, grandad?

743
01:12:49,292 --> 01:12:50,875
It's... difficult!

744
01:12:53,250 --> 01:12:55,292
Are you working on the time?

745
01:12:55,417 --> 01:12:58,875
I'm reducing the hours for them 
 as you said.

746
01:12:59,000 --> 01:13:01,000
Six hours per day!

747
01:13:01,875 --> 01:13:04,208
Don't overdo it, okay?

748
01:13:05,417 --> 01:13:09,292
In 20 years, 
 I've saved them 5 years.

749
01:13:09,417 --> 01:13:11,500
You can imagine what 5 years less

750
01:13:11,667 --> 01:13:14,333
in a cellar means?

751
01:13:53,583 --> 01:13:57,542
Air raid! Come on, comrades!

752
01:13:57,667 --> 01:14:00,167
Let's go! Hurry up! 
 Leave the weapons!

753
01:14:00,292 --> 01:14:02,833
Everybody in the tank!

754
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:06,000
The aggressor 
 is attacking again!

755
01:14:06,167 --> 01:14:09,708
Don't panic! 
 Where are you going, you donkey?

756
01:14:15,375 --> 01:14:19,250
Hurry up, woman. 
 We'll all get killed because of you.

757
01:14:23,000 --> 01:14:24,083
Hurry!

758
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:55,792
Comrade Tito, 
 we swear to you...

759
01:15:06,250 --> 01:15:08,000
Tito, Tito, Tito!

760
01:15:08,083 --> 01:15:10,500
Everyone sang the same song

761
01:15:10,667 --> 01:15:13,042
and believed that outside

762
01:15:13,208 --> 01:15:15,500
the fascists of World War II

763
01:15:15,625 --> 01:15:17,542
were still in power...

764
01:15:45,833 --> 01:15:47,500
What are you doing, Marko?

765
01:15:50,167 --> 01:15:51,750
You'll see.

766
01:16:36,042 --> 01:16:39,708
Ringe ringe raja 
 Here comes uncle Paja

767
01:16:48,917 --> 01:16:50,792
And now?

768
01:16:53,083 --> 01:16:54,292
Natalija!

769
01:18:15,875 --> 01:18:18,333
Natalija, Spring is coming

770
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:19,958
on a white horse!

771
01:18:20,125 --> 01:18:22,750
Stop! Cut!

772
01:18:22,917 --> 01:18:24,333
Cut!

773
01:18:24,458 --> 01:18:26,625
Why stop?

774
01:18:27,917 --> 01:18:29,250
What for? Why stop now?

775
01:18:29,417 --> 01:18:32,958
Yugoslav, fuck you and that water! 
 You call that rain?

776
01:18:33,083 --> 01:18:34,750
Stop! Okay!

777
01:18:34,875 --> 01:18:36,750
Will you ever simply say: act?

778
01:18:36,917 --> 01:18:38,958
When'll you tell me to act?

779
01:18:40,083 --> 01:18:42,083
Thank you, lads. Take a break.

780
01:18:42,208 --> 01:18:44,042
Put the water back on!

781
01:18:47,750 --> 01:18:50,250
Here he comes! Music!

782
01:19:20,792 --> 01:19:23,958
Spring is Coming on a White Horse. 
 Scene 34a, take 2.

783
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:25,292
Action!

784
01:19:26,292 --> 01:19:27,833
The Germans!

785
01:19:37,583 --> 01:19:40,000
Natalija, darling!

786
01:19:40,125 --> 01:19:43,250
Spring has arrived 
 on its white horse.

787
01:19:58,708 --> 01:20:00,500
Rape!

788
01:20:10,042 --> 01:20:12,042
No one will catch

789
01:20:12,167 --> 01:20:15,625
Petar Popara, alias Blacky!

790
01:20:15,750 --> 01:20:17,250
Natalija!

791
01:20:44,875 --> 01:20:48,792
Long live the Communist Party 
 of Yugoslavia!

792
01:20:50,958 --> 01:20:51,958
Rape!

793
01:20:56,500 --> 01:20:58,625
Cut! Stop the camera!

794
01:20:58,792 --> 01:21:01,583
Comrade Marko!

795
01:21:03,875 --> 01:21:05,750
Get up all of you!

796
01:21:06,625 --> 01:21:07,792
Stop the rain!

797
01:21:07,958 --> 01:21:12,042
Comrade artists, 
 be happy in your work.

798
01:21:13,000 --> 01:21:14,875
You are portraying...

799
01:21:16,250 --> 01:21:19,250
great people

800
01:21:19,375 --> 01:21:20,875
who are no longer with us.

801
01:21:21,042 --> 01:21:25,500
We owe them a tribute. 
 Future generations must remember them.

802
01:21:25,667 --> 01:21:27,667
May you live long, comrade artists!

803
01:21:31,708 --> 01:21:33,125
Music!

804
01:21:53,375 --> 01:21:55,958
Cheers, Comrade Marko!

805
01:21:58,000 --> 01:21:59,542
Comrade Marko...

806
01:22:00,667 --> 01:22:04,083
allow me to introduce 
 the heroes of your memoirs.

807
01:22:09,833 --> 01:22:12,333
Get lost! Not now!

808
01:22:18,708 --> 01:22:20,417
Are you me?

809
01:22:22,250 --> 01:22:25,167
Marko! 
 Yes, I am you.

810
01:22:28,458 --> 01:22:30,083
Unbelievable!

811
01:22:35,458 --> 01:22:37,375
He looks just like me.

812
01:22:38,708 --> 01:22:40,000
Where did you find them?

813
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:42,167
Casting is half my job.

814
01:22:42,292 --> 01:22:45,542
Really? Unbelievable!

815
01:22:45,708 --> 01:22:48,667
We're cut of the same cloth 
 and swapped our books for rifles.

816
01:22:51,333 --> 01:22:54,625
"Shoot, my rifle, 
 for mother to hear you.

817
01:22:54,750 --> 01:22:57,417
"Never will I abandon my country 
 to anyone."

818
01:22:58,458 --> 01:22:59,958
Well, say hello.

819
01:23:01,667 --> 01:23:03,125
What do you say?

820
01:23:03,250 --> 01:23:04,667
She's so sweet!

821
01:23:04,833 --> 01:23:06,667
Indeed!

822
01:23:07,792 --> 01:23:09,208
Franz?

823
01:23:10,167 --> 01:23:11,167
Franz the vampire.

824
01:23:12,458 --> 01:23:18,250
It's very nice here 
 but I feel someone is missing.

825
01:23:18,417 --> 01:23:20,500
God, is he the real Franz 
 or an actor?

826
01:23:20,667 --> 01:23:22,208
Who knows?

827
01:23:22,375 --> 01:23:23,417
An actor.

828
01:23:23,583 --> 01:23:25,542
Yes, an actor...

829
01:23:25,708 --> 01:23:30,792
Unbelievable! 
 It's all just like that night...

830
01:23:30,958 --> 01:23:34,042
When you killed 11 Germans, 
 dived into the river...

831
01:23:34,167 --> 01:23:36,542
- What a memory! 
 ...and saved Blacky and Natalija.

832
01:23:38,208 --> 01:23:39,250
Indeed!

833
01:23:41,250 --> 01:23:42,250
Excuse me, please.

834
01:23:46,333 --> 01:23:47,417
Blacky!

835
01:24:01,750 --> 01:24:04,000
My friend!

836
01:24:05,875 --> 01:24:07,667
God, Blacky...

837
01:24:10,625 --> 01:24:13,292
Why did they kill you, my friend? 
 Why did they kill you?

838
01:24:17,042 --> 01:24:19,542
Can someone protect the actors 
 in this film?

839
01:24:19,667 --> 01:24:22,292
I've been burnt 
 three times already!

840
01:24:22,417 --> 01:24:23,708
Three times!

841
01:24:37,750 --> 01:24:40,542
Comrade Marko, 
 it will be a great film!

842
01:24:53,292 --> 01:24:54,708
Are you afraid of God?

843
01:24:54,833 --> 01:24:56,958
You mean, 
 are we afraid of God?

844
01:25:07,292 --> 01:25:10,833
You'd better learn that text 
 as it's written.

845
01:25:11,000 --> 01:25:14,750
Word by word. Understand?

846
01:25:39,250 --> 01:25:40,833
Sleep tight.

847
01:25:54,375 --> 01:25:55,625
What is this?

848
01:26:01,000 --> 01:26:02,708
What you'll tell him

849
01:26:02,875 --> 01:26:03,875
in the cellar.

850
01:26:08,417 --> 01:26:09,750
This?

851
01:26:11,083 --> 01:26:15,250
You know, trash like this,

852
01:26:15,375 --> 01:26:17,417
whoever the writer

853
01:26:17,583 --> 01:26:19,333
or the director may be, 
 is still trash.

854
01:26:19,500 --> 01:26:21,250
If they ask me what I think,

855
01:26:21,417 --> 01:26:23,083
here's what I think!

856
01:26:27,000 --> 01:26:29,958
You're a poet, Marko!

857
01:26:30,083 --> 01:26:31,083
Stick to poems!

858
01:26:31,250 --> 01:26:33,708
Natalija, what's missing?

859
01:26:33,833 --> 01:26:35,792
What's missing?

860
01:26:35,917 --> 01:26:37,042
The truth!

861
01:26:37,167 --> 01:26:38,625
The truth?

862
01:26:38,792 --> 01:26:39,792
Yes, darling!

863
01:26:39,958 --> 01:26:42,333
You know, the truth...

864
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:55,792
No text, my dear, 
 has any truth in it.

865
01:26:55,917 --> 01:27:00,208
The truth exists only in real life.

866
01:27:01,667 --> 01:27:03,708
You are the truth!

867
01:27:04,958 --> 01:27:06,625
You!

868
01:27:06,792 --> 01:27:10,375
You are supposed to be the truth.

869
01:27:11,292 --> 01:27:13,333
There is no truth, 
 only your conviction

870
01:27:13,458 --> 01:27:16,167
that what you act is the truth.

871
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:21,000
No, art is a lie,

872
01:27:21,125 --> 01:27:23,292
a big lie!

873
01:27:23,458 --> 01:27:26,042
We are all liars, 
 a little bit at least.

874
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:33,167
You scum!

875
01:28:13,125 --> 01:28:17,625
They raped me, beat me...

876
01:28:17,750 --> 01:28:20,833
What else did they do to me? 
 What?

877
01:28:20,958 --> 01:28:23,208
Does it really matter if 
 those people in the cellar stay alive?

878
01:28:23,375 --> 01:28:25,625
Yes it does, my dear.

879
01:28:26,958 --> 01:28:29,542
You write heroic roles for yourself

880
01:28:29,667 --> 01:28:32,167
and I get to play the whore.

881
01:28:32,292 --> 01:28:35,042
Anyone can fuck your wife!

882
01:28:36,792 --> 01:28:38,750
Get dressed 
 and put the make-up on.

883
01:28:40,083 --> 01:28:43,417
I said I'd rescue you 
 in time for the wedding.

884
01:28:47,542 --> 01:28:48,958
Come on, please.

885
01:28:49,125 --> 01:28:50,792
Please, get dressed 
 and put your make-up on.

886
01:28:50,917 --> 01:28:52,167
I said no.

887
01:28:54,042 --> 01:28:55,708
I said no!

888
01:28:57,667 --> 01:29:01,750
I can't act a part 
 I don't believe in.

889
01:29:54,333 --> 01:29:55,583
Look what they did to her!

890
01:29:56,833 --> 01:29:58,083
Fucking fascist

891
01:29:58,208 --> 01:29:59,250
motherfuckers!

892
01:30:13,625 --> 01:30:15,500
I love you!

893
01:30:18,500 --> 01:30:19,625
Hear that?

894
01:30:27,250 --> 01:30:29,125
She said she loved me...

895
01:30:31,750 --> 01:30:33,083
What?

896
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:34,833
Did you hear that?

897
01:30:38,417 --> 01:30:39,417
And you?

898
01:30:44,708 --> 01:30:46,625
She said she loved me.

899
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:02,542
He's just like me!

900
01:33:33,375 --> 01:33:36,542
Dear friends, 
 welcome to my son's wedding...

901
01:33:36,708 --> 01:33:37,708
Cut it out!

902
01:33:39,667 --> 01:33:42,250
This day has come at last.

903
01:33:42,375 --> 01:33:46,667
My son, dad has bought gold rings. 
 Give one to your bride.

904
01:33:48,333 --> 01:33:52,917
Do not be offended 
 by the modesty of the wedding meal.

905
01:33:53,042 --> 01:33:55,500
What can we do? 
 There's a war on.

906
01:33:55,667 --> 01:33:59,375
But everything we offer 
 is offered from the heart!

907
01:33:59,500 --> 01:34:01,000
And if there was no war...

908
01:34:02,708 --> 01:34:06,167
And if the times were any better, 
 and if his mother was alive...

909
01:34:06,375 --> 01:34:07,833
Keep it happy, my friend!

910
01:34:08,000 --> 01:34:09,000
Thank you, my friend!

911
01:34:10,667 --> 01:34:12,792
Comrades...

912
01:34:12,958 --> 01:34:15,708
This is the right moment 
 for all of us

913
01:34:15,833 --> 01:34:21,708
to thank Comrade Marko 
 from the bottom of our hearts

914
01:34:21,875 --> 01:34:23,917
for all these years 
 during which

915
01:34:24,083 --> 01:34:29,542
he has looked after us, 
 fed us and tended to us.

916
01:34:29,667 --> 01:34:32,167
I want to say: 
 Thank you, my Marko!

917
01:34:33,625 --> 01:34:36,333
Thank you, Comrade Marko!

918
01:34:48,167 --> 01:34:49,167
Sit down!

919
01:34:49,333 --> 01:34:52,792
Last month, we produced 
 200 light weapons.

920
01:34:52,917 --> 01:34:54,167
Is that nothing?

921
01:34:54,333 --> 01:34:55,375
No, it's not!

922
01:34:55,542 --> 01:34:56,750
Bravo!

923
01:34:56,875 --> 01:34:57,917
Thanks, Marko!

924
01:34:58,083 --> 01:35:02,042
But our greatest success 
 is our tank,

925
01:35:02,167 --> 01:35:05,542
the one we made 
 with our own hands!

926
01:35:05,708 --> 01:35:09,042
I am happy and proud of the fact 
 that the time will soon come

927
01:35:09,208 --> 01:35:14,667
when we shall use our tank 
 to liberate our country for good!

928
01:35:14,833 --> 01:35:17,792
Tank... forward!

929
01:35:22,125 --> 01:35:24,083
Congratulations, comrades!

930
01:35:26,208 --> 01:35:27,417
Congratulations!

931
01:35:36,417 --> 01:35:37,750
Thank you, uncle Marko.

932
01:36:18,583 --> 01:36:21,042
Whose brats are these?

933
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,708
They belong to us all. 
 Play, you fucker!

934
01:36:26,792 --> 01:36:28,833
We...

935
01:36:29,000 --> 01:36:33,333
The two of us made this together...

936
01:36:33,500 --> 01:36:36,250
You shouldn't have. 
 Thank you, lvan.

937
01:36:44,333 --> 01:36:46,250
Come on, 
 I have something to tell you.

938
01:36:50,042 --> 01:36:52,208
I need a quick word with him.

939
01:36:57,792 --> 01:36:59,292
Listen...

940
01:36:59,417 --> 01:37:03,042
as soon as everyone's drunk, 
 we'll get out to fight.

941
01:37:03,208 --> 01:37:04,958
Not a drop until Liberation!

942
01:37:07,542 --> 01:37:09,083
Marko will be angry.

943
01:37:09,250 --> 01:37:11,625
I've waited for Marko, the Russians, Tito 
 and the Party

944
01:37:11,750 --> 01:37:13,792
for 15 years! 
 The time's never right.

945
01:37:14,000 --> 01:37:15,417
The time is now!

946
01:37:15,583 --> 01:37:17,500
Let's kill the scum and end the war!

947
01:37:17,625 --> 01:37:19,125
That's it, my son!

948
01:37:20,667 --> 01:37:21,708
Let's go!

949
01:37:36,292 --> 01:37:37,917
You little bastards!

950
01:39:33,333 --> 01:39:37,083
Stop drinking, Natalija.

951
01:39:37,250 --> 01:39:39,000
- Give me the bottle back. 
 - What?

952
01:39:39,167 --> 01:39:41,125
- The bottle! 
 - I'll give you the bottle all right!

953
01:39:41,292 --> 01:39:42,292
Here!

954
01:39:48,042 --> 01:39:50,083
Stop drinking when I tell you.

955
01:39:51,333 --> 01:39:55,083
I would but I can't look at you 
 when I'm sober.

956
01:39:55,208 --> 01:39:57,417
You can't look at me 
 but you can look at him?

957
01:39:57,583 --> 01:40:00,500
I thought I could 
 but I can't either.

958
01:40:00,625 --> 01:40:02,708
You can't look at him either?

959
01:40:03,250 --> 01:40:06,167
See this? 
 This is for you.

960
01:40:08,042 --> 01:40:10,625
And this is for him.

961
01:40:14,042 --> 01:40:19,458
I drink brandy and you've been drinking my 
 blood for 20 years, motherfucker!

962
01:40:20,292 --> 01:40:23,125
Natalija, you fucking bitch!

963
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:26,917
Fuck you and your fucking mother too!

964
01:40:29,583 --> 01:40:31,125
Where's Blacky?

965
01:40:36,542 --> 01:40:38,083
How are you?

966
01:41:04,667 --> 01:41:09,292
Darling! What is it, darling?

967
01:41:09,458 --> 01:41:12,417
You're crying!

968
01:41:12,542 --> 01:41:14,208
Why are you crying?

969
01:41:14,375 --> 01:41:15,500
I don't know.

970
01:41:17,083 --> 01:41:18,708
Are you happy?

971
01:41:18,833 --> 01:41:20,917
Yes, I'm happy!

972
01:41:21,875 --> 01:41:23,708
Are you crying 
 because you're happy?

973
01:41:30,292 --> 01:41:35,583
Is it moonlight at noon

974
01:41:40,500 --> 01:41:44,292
Is it sunshine at midnight

975
01:41:47,542 --> 01:41:51,708
From the skies above 
 Light is beaming

976
01:41:51,875 --> 01:41:54,667
Nobody knows, nobody knows

977
01:41:55,667 --> 01:41:59,625
Nobody knows, nobody knows

978
01:41:59,792 --> 01:42:02,917
What is really shining

979
01:42:26,375 --> 01:42:27,542
Motherfucker!

980
01:42:29,500 --> 01:42:30,583
What's wrong with you?

981
01:42:30,750 --> 01:42:32,917
My time has come at last!

982
01:42:34,083 --> 01:42:35,458
Cut it out!

983
01:42:37,958 --> 01:42:43,208
You too! Here you are! 
 I've had enough of both of you!

984
01:42:43,375 --> 01:42:44,958
Enough!

985
01:42:51,417 --> 01:42:53,875
You pathetic little man!

986
01:42:55,458 --> 01:42:56,708
What do you want?

987
01:43:00,083 --> 01:43:01,792
What's wrong, Natalija?

988
01:43:01,917 --> 01:43:03,083
I wasted my youth!

989
01:43:03,208 --> 01:43:04,250
What youth?

990
01:43:04,375 --> 01:43:09,958
Twenty years! Twenty years 
 of my blood-stained life!

991
01:43:10,083 --> 01:43:11,833
This is a catastrophe!

992
01:43:29,875 --> 01:43:31,667
This brandy's good!

993
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:34,208
It's strong! Real strong stuff.

994
01:43:44,667 --> 01:43:47,833
The monkey's getting into the tank!

995
01:43:48,000 --> 01:43:49,208
A catastrophe!

996
01:44:02,042 --> 01:44:03,458
The gun's moving!

997
01:44:03,583 --> 01:44:06,417
He's moving it! A catastrophe!

998
01:44:09,000 --> 01:44:10,125
Some wine, Natalija?

999
01:44:12,625 --> 01:44:16,708
Shit, I lost!

1000
01:44:19,708 --> 01:44:21,292
And I chose the rules.

1001
01:44:26,333 --> 01:44:28,208
If there was no war...

1002
01:44:30,167 --> 01:44:33,500
Otchy

1003
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:36,000
tchernye...

1004
01:44:36,167 --> 01:44:39,083
Otchy strasnye...

1005
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:45,333
I'd have been the leading lady 
 of the Moscow State Theatre.

1006
01:44:45,458 --> 01:44:48,208
I'd have performed 
 in my mother tongue...

1007
01:44:49,375 --> 01:44:51,042
What's this rubbish?

1008
01:44:51,208 --> 01:44:55,500
Since when has your mother 
 been Russian?

1009
01:44:55,667 --> 01:44:57,375
You're drunk!

1010
01:44:58,583 --> 01:45:00,458
Listen to me...

1011
01:45:00,625 --> 01:45:03,958
You can't talk to her 
 as if she was your wife!

1012
01:45:04,083 --> 01:45:05,333
Understood?

1013
01:45:05,500 --> 01:45:07,167
You're absolutely right!

1014
01:45:07,292 --> 01:45:10,125
Every good party 
 needs a Russian song!

1015
01:45:18,125 --> 01:45:20,875
Without the war, I'd have been

1016
01:45:21,042 --> 01:45:23,375
the Yugoslav Maakovski.

1017
01:45:24,250 --> 01:45:25,708
I'd have gone to his grave 
 in Moscow,

1018
01:45:25,875 --> 01:45:27,708
bowed and said:

1019
01:45:27,833 --> 01:45:31,000
"You were heard from the heavens 
 like thunder.

1020
01:45:31,125 --> 01:45:34,667
"We marched along behind you." 
 Left! Left!

1021
01:45:37,917 --> 01:45:40,000
No one will listen.

1022
01:45:40,125 --> 01:45:42,583
The monkey's in the tank!

1023
01:45:42,708 --> 01:45:43,958
He's smart.

1024
01:45:44,083 --> 01:45:45,292
- It's a catastrophe! 
 - Get lost!

1025
01:45:48,208 --> 01:45:49,583
What did you want to tell me?

1026
01:45:50,375 --> 01:45:52,958
Something terrible.

1027
01:45:54,333 --> 01:45:55,667
So tell me.

1028
01:45:56,458 --> 01:45:59,250
Later, I don't want 
 to spoil the wedding.

1029
01:45:59,417 --> 01:46:01,167
Tell me, don't worry.

1030
01:46:03,417 --> 01:46:04,500
What?

1031
01:46:05,500 --> 01:46:08,792
You love Marko, right? 
 I know that.

1032
01:46:12,042 --> 01:46:13,250
- It's not that. 
 - It is!

1033
01:46:13,417 --> 01:46:15,083
- It's not. 
 - It is!

1034
01:46:15,250 --> 01:46:19,208
It's not that. I wanted to tell you 
 this is all a lie.

1035
01:46:19,333 --> 01:46:21,917
Our whole life is a lie.

1036
01:46:22,042 --> 01:46:24,250
And I can't live without you!

1037
01:46:25,167 --> 01:46:26,833
You can't?

1038
01:46:28,417 --> 01:46:29,458
Oh, come on...

1039
01:46:33,292 --> 01:46:35,125
Music!

1040
01:46:35,250 --> 01:46:36,667
Stop the music!

1041
01:46:38,375 --> 01:46:39,500
Did you hear what I said?

1042
01:46:40,750 --> 01:46:43,875
My son! Listen carefully 
 to what I say.

1043
01:46:44,042 --> 01:46:46,375
Never trust a lying woman.

1044
01:46:46,542 --> 01:46:48,167
I won't, dad!

1045
01:47:20,375 --> 01:47:24,000
You're frightened, Colonel, 
 aren't you?

1046
01:47:24,125 --> 01:47:26,333
Stop drinking and talking rubbish!

1047
01:47:26,458 --> 01:47:27,833
Frightened?

1048
01:47:27,958 --> 01:47:29,292
Colonel...

1049
01:47:29,458 --> 01:47:32,333
I'll kill you! 
 I swear to God I will!

1050
01:47:35,292 --> 01:47:38,792
How could you kill me? 
 I've been dead for twenty years.

1051
01:47:39,917 --> 01:47:43,042
Try it. Maybe they'll promote you 
 to Secret Service General.

1052
01:47:44,417 --> 01:47:45,458
Stop it!

1053
01:47:50,458 --> 01:47:54,500
You couldn't give me a child, 
 so kill me!

1054
01:47:54,667 --> 01:47:56,542
Maybe you can manage that!

1055
01:47:56,667 --> 01:48:00,417
You're evil!

1056
01:48:02,750 --> 01:48:03,750
What am I?

1057
01:48:05,500 --> 01:48:08,083
A murderer! A criminal!

1058
01:48:08,208 --> 01:48:09,500
A thief!

1059
01:48:09,667 --> 01:48:11,792
So I'm evil?

1060
01:48:11,917 --> 01:48:13,708
- Worse than that. 
 - Worse?

1061
01:48:13,875 --> 01:48:17,708
Do you know why I'm so evil? 
 Do you?

1062
01:48:17,875 --> 01:48:20,208
Do you know why?

1063
01:48:20,375 --> 01:48:21,667
You're damned!

1064
01:48:21,833 --> 01:48:23,792
Because I love you.

1065
01:48:23,958 --> 01:48:25,583
I love you!

1066
01:48:30,750 --> 01:48:32,333
When you fell for me,

1067
01:48:32,500 --> 01:48:37,000
you put these people down here 
 to live, die and work for you!

1068
01:48:37,167 --> 01:48:39,625
Because I love you, 
 don't you see?

1069
01:48:39,750 --> 01:48:41,917
I can't live without you!

1070
01:48:42,042 --> 01:48:44,125
Do they miss anything?

1071
01:48:45,375 --> 01:48:46,667
Yes, a lot!

1072
01:48:48,917 --> 01:48:52,083
You dragged me 
 into your crime...

1073
01:48:55,417 --> 01:48:57,625
because you love me?

1074
01:48:59,083 --> 01:49:00,875
Only because I love you!

1075
01:49:01,042 --> 01:49:03,625
What else do I have? 
 Children? Friends?

1076
01:49:03,750 --> 01:49:05,583
You have nothing!

1077
01:49:05,708 --> 01:49:07,583
I have nothing...

1078
01:49:07,750 --> 01:49:09,542
but you...

1079
01:49:09,708 --> 01:49:11,542
if you want that.

1080
01:49:17,125 --> 01:49:19,167
My God...

1081
01:49:20,708 --> 01:49:22,500
You lie so beautifully!

1082
01:49:25,208 --> 01:49:26,500
I never lie!

1083
01:49:40,250 --> 01:49:42,792
What are you doing, 
 my... friend?

1084
01:49:42,917 --> 01:49:44,833
Just talking.

1085
01:49:44,958 --> 01:49:46,292
Talking?

1086
01:49:49,792 --> 01:49:52,958
And you have to talk in the dark?

1087
01:49:53,083 --> 01:49:54,417
The noise disturbed us.

1088
01:49:59,208 --> 01:50:01,375
The noise disturbed you?

1089
01:50:07,083 --> 01:50:09,208
The party disturbs you?

1090
01:50:14,125 --> 01:50:16,625
- My son's wedding disturbs you? 
 - You misunderstood me!

1091
01:50:16,792 --> 01:50:19,833
I understood perfectly, believe me.

1092
01:50:23,167 --> 01:50:24,958
I have a headache.

1093
01:50:25,125 --> 01:50:26,625
How surprising!

1094
01:50:36,458 --> 01:50:38,375
Look at them.

1095
01:50:41,625 --> 01:50:42,750
Give it to me...

1096
01:50:48,583 --> 01:50:50,625
My friend...

1097
01:50:51,417 --> 01:50:54,583
let's break the tradition of a friend

1098
01:50:54,708 --> 01:50:57,125
killing his best friend.

1099
01:50:57,250 --> 01:50:58,875
Here's the gun...

1100
01:51:00,667 --> 01:51:01,833
Do the rest yourself!

1101
01:51:04,208 --> 01:51:06,375
- You know why? 
 - I know.

1102
01:51:08,542 --> 01:51:10,167
I think it's fair.

1103
01:51:21,625 --> 01:51:23,917
I'm a free woman!

1104
01:51:42,833 --> 01:51:46,000
A catastrophe!

1105
01:51:55,667 --> 01:51:57,708
Now we'll see 
 whose mother will mourn.

1106
01:52:27,917 --> 01:52:29,458
Dad!

1107
01:53:08,250 --> 01:53:09,583
Jovan, my son!

1108
01:53:12,833 --> 01:53:14,417
Get the weapons!

1109
01:53:21,833 --> 01:53:24,708
We're going!

1110
01:53:26,625 --> 01:53:27,625
Where to?

1111
01:53:27,750 --> 01:53:29,583
Outside, to end the war!

1112
01:54:12,292 --> 01:54:13,833
The Germans will kill us.

1113
01:54:14,208 --> 01:54:15,250
But, dad...

1114
01:54:15,417 --> 01:54:16,458
Stop daddying me!

1115
01:54:16,583 --> 01:54:17,750
Come on!

1116
01:54:17,917 --> 01:54:20,500
We're off to war, 
 not to a brothel!

1117
01:54:20,625 --> 01:54:23,042
The Germans will kill me!

1118
01:54:23,208 --> 01:54:24,917
Right!

1119
01:54:25,083 --> 01:54:28,083
Women and revolution 
 don't go together. Untie us!

1120
01:54:35,792 --> 01:54:39,500
Don't cry, Natalija. 
 We won't be parted long this time.

1121
01:54:41,958 --> 01:54:43,667
I'll wait for you!

1122
01:54:48,583 --> 01:54:50,458
I'll wait for you!

1123
01:55:06,583 --> 01:55:07,750
Soni!

1124
01:55:52,208 --> 01:55:53,542
Jovan, my son!

1125
01:55:53,708 --> 01:55:54,708
Dad!

1126
01:56:07,958 --> 01:56:09,708
Smell the Danube?

1127
01:56:09,875 --> 01:56:10,958
I don't.

1128
01:56:11,125 --> 01:56:14,208
You really get on my nerves... 
 Come on!

1129
01:56:23,375 --> 01:56:24,958
Dad!

1130
01:56:47,000 --> 01:56:48,667
- One question. 
 - What?

1131
01:56:48,792 --> 01:56:50,167
The colour...

1132
01:56:51,750 --> 01:56:53,458
You call this green?

1133
01:56:53,583 --> 01:56:54,958
Dark green.

1134
01:56:55,083 --> 01:56:56,208
You call this green?

1135
01:56:56,333 --> 01:56:58,125
Green!

1136
01:56:58,292 --> 01:57:00,375
Motherfuckers...

1137
01:57:03,625 --> 01:57:04,875
Fuckers!

1138
01:57:05,042 --> 01:57:06,708
He hates the colour.

1139
01:57:08,333 --> 01:57:11,208
Green!

1140
01:57:11,333 --> 01:57:13,292
Fuck your green!

1141
01:57:13,458 --> 01:57:14,958
Torturer!

1142
01:57:15,125 --> 01:57:16,708
Criminal!

1143
01:57:17,375 --> 01:57:19,708
The director 
 is waiting for you!

1144
01:57:20,708 --> 01:57:22,417
Keep on pissing...

1145
01:57:22,583 --> 01:57:24,083
Keep on pissing!

1146
01:57:24,208 --> 01:57:25,208
Not for long...

1147
01:57:25,375 --> 01:57:26,375
Not for long!

1148
01:57:44,500 --> 01:57:45,833
Hit out, son!

1149
01:57:46,250 --> 01:57:47,833
Not me, you moron!

1150
01:57:53,042 --> 01:57:55,583
You dare piss on my city?

1151
01:57:55,750 --> 01:57:57,250
- Dad's city! 
 - My city!

1152
01:58:00,917 --> 01:58:06,208
62, 64, 66, 68, 70...

1153
01:58:06,333 --> 01:58:09,667
Shit! 
 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...

1154
01:58:09,833 --> 01:58:11,917
Madam, where's Jovan?

1155
01:58:12,083 --> 01:58:16,583
- They've gone outside. Someone fired. 
 - They'll betray us.

1156
01:58:21,417 --> 01:58:23,583
They won't be able to betray anyone.

1157
01:58:25,167 --> 01:58:26,208
They were killed.

1158
01:58:35,583 --> 01:58:39,250
Ringe ringe raja 
 Here comes Uncle Paja

1159
01:59:53,958 --> 01:59:57,167
We are at this historic spot

1160
01:59:57,333 --> 02:00:00,125
where in the year of 19...

1161
02:00:04,542 --> 02:00:07,167
1944...

1162
02:00:07,333 --> 02:00:12,083
cowardly criminals murdered 
 our National Hero,

1163
02:00:12,208 --> 02:00:13,833
Petar Popara Blacky.

1164
02:00:25,792 --> 02:00:28,500
Don't be afraid, my son! 
 Don't be afraid.

1165
02:00:32,208 --> 02:00:33,417
What was that, dad?

1166
02:00:33,583 --> 02:00:35,042
A pheasant.

1167
02:00:36,708 --> 02:00:37,958
Is it dangerous?

1168
02:00:39,083 --> 02:00:40,917
A pheasant? Dangerous?

1169
02:00:41,083 --> 02:00:42,917
It's like a wild hen!

1170
02:00:47,375 --> 02:00:49,292
There's the sun.

1171
02:00:51,667 --> 02:00:53,667
That's the moon, my boy.

1172
02:00:54,917 --> 02:00:56,417
The moon.

1173
02:00:56,542 --> 02:00:58,542
Where's the sun?

1174
02:00:58,708 --> 02:01:00,667
The sun is asleep.

1175
02:01:00,833 --> 02:01:02,125
It is resting.

1176
02:01:15,292 --> 02:01:16,333
Come on!

1177
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:22,042
Keep down!

1178
02:01:55,500 --> 02:01:59,042
I'm just saying that you

1179
02:01:59,167 --> 02:02:03,792
look so much like Franzi, 
 and Franzi is short

1180
02:02:03,917 --> 02:02:06,708
for Franz.

1181
02:02:06,875 --> 02:02:09,125
Because "i" is the smallest letter.

1182
02:02:09,292 --> 02:02:10,417
Here we are!

1183
02:02:10,583 --> 02:02:12,542
Franz!

1184
02:02:17,292 --> 02:02:21,667
See that blond man, son? 
 That's Franz.

1185
02:02:23,833 --> 02:02:25,708
Look at him.

1186
02:02:25,875 --> 02:02:28,625
He hasn't changed in fifteen years.

1187
02:02:31,708 --> 02:02:34,333
That's Germans for you!

1188
02:02:37,375 --> 02:02:39,125
He tortured you.

1189
02:02:40,250 --> 02:02:42,292
And sent Natalija to a camp.

1190
02:02:46,500 --> 02:02:47,542
Perfect!

1191
02:02:47,708 --> 02:02:51,250
A disguise? 
 He thinks I won't recognize him.

1192
02:02:52,708 --> 02:02:55,208
What's the other one doing?

1193
02:02:59,417 --> 02:03:01,083
A collaborator!

1194
02:03:05,958 --> 02:03:08,000
Franz!

1195
02:03:08,167 --> 02:03:12,000
What's all this smoke? 
 Sabotage or what?

1196
02:03:33,875 --> 02:03:36,792
Let's make the execution 
 look as natural as possible.

1197
02:03:38,625 --> 02:03:39,917
What?

1198
02:03:40,083 --> 02:03:43,125
Dad, he looks like you!

1199
02:03:43,292 --> 02:03:45,667
- Who? 
 - That one!

1200
02:03:45,792 --> 02:03:47,375
The skinny one?

1201
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:49,375
You really get on my nerves!

1202
02:03:49,542 --> 02:03:52,917
I could belt you at times. 
 You're just like your mother.

1203
02:03:53,083 --> 02:03:57,417
I don't believe it! 
 You ask me to act naturally!

1204
02:03:57,542 --> 02:04:01,167
- I didn't say that! 
 - Yes, you did. I'm not stupid.

1205
02:04:01,292 --> 02:04:03,625
You did say that.

1206
02:04:03,792 --> 02:04:04,792
Honestly...

1207
02:04:09,167 --> 02:04:12,208
Come on, don't be touchy!

1208
02:04:12,375 --> 02:04:16,125
Honestly, I don't know 
 what I'm supposed to do now!

1209
02:04:16,292 --> 02:04:18,292
Hold on!

1210
02:04:18,458 --> 02:04:20,000
Is this natural for you?

1211
02:04:25,458 --> 02:04:27,417
Honestly, man...

1212
02:04:27,542 --> 02:04:29,417
Come and shoot me!

1213
02:04:29,583 --> 02:04:31,167
That's it!

1214
02:04:31,292 --> 02:04:34,792
Here's the gun and the camera, 
 now shoot me!

1215
02:04:34,917 --> 02:04:38,708
The one like you 
 seems very brave.

1216
02:04:38,833 --> 02:04:41,333
All brave people look like me.

1217
02:04:41,458 --> 02:04:43,958
Are you soldiers 
 or ballerinas?

1218
02:04:44,083 --> 02:04:45,250
Look at you!

1219
02:04:45,375 --> 02:04:47,583
Come on, roll!

1220
02:04:47,750 --> 02:04:51,375
Where's the smoke? 
 Never there when it's needed!

1221
02:04:55,500 --> 02:04:58,667
Get away from me! Now!

1222
02:04:58,792 --> 02:05:03,792
Look what he's doing. 
 He'd stop at nothing!

1223
02:05:03,958 --> 02:05:07,042
That's true. But he's the best 
 I've ever worked with.

1224
02:05:07,208 --> 02:05:09,750
And I've worked with quite a few...

1225
02:05:09,875 --> 02:05:13,542
He gives us room to improvise.

1226
02:05:13,708 --> 02:05:17,792
Get lost! Get away from me! 
 I can't concentrate!

1227
02:05:17,958 --> 02:05:19,208
Tell her!

1228
02:05:21,167 --> 02:05:22,375
Get to your places.

1229
02:05:22,542 --> 02:05:25,625
"Spring Comes on a White Horse", 
 scene 32a, take one.

1230
02:05:27,292 --> 02:05:28,375
Action!

1231
02:05:28,500 --> 02:05:31,667
Get rid of that! Get rid of it!

1232
02:05:31,833 --> 02:05:35,083
I want to look death in the eye!

1233
02:05:35,208 --> 02:05:37,208
Would you like one last cigarette?

1234
02:05:45,875 --> 02:05:50,583
Long live the Communist Party 
 of Yugoslavia!

1235
02:05:50,708 --> 02:05:52,958
Take aim!

1236
02:05:59,292 --> 02:06:00,792
What happened?

1237
02:06:02,042 --> 02:06:03,750
That's it! Natural!

1238
02:06:03,917 --> 02:06:06,208
That's natural!

1239
02:06:08,250 --> 02:06:09,250
Go on!

1240
02:06:09,375 --> 02:06:13,083
What do you mean? 
 We never agreed on this!

1241
02:06:13,208 --> 02:06:15,875
Go on acting! 
 Don't interrupt the shot!

1242
02:06:16,042 --> 02:06:17,917
Act!

1243
02:06:18,042 --> 02:06:20,625
Call this directing? God!

1244
02:06:20,792 --> 02:06:25,917
Long live the Communist Party 
 of Yugoslavia!

1245
02:06:26,083 --> 02:06:28,875
Under the leadership 
 of Comrade Tito!

1246
02:06:29,042 --> 02:06:31,667
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

1247
02:06:35,625 --> 02:06:39,958
Don't interrupt the sequence, 
 you idiots!

1248
02:06:44,583 --> 02:06:46,208
Throw it, son!

1249
02:07:02,375 --> 02:07:03,750
Charge!

1250
02:07:09,375 --> 02:07:11,417
Just like me!

1251
02:07:11,583 --> 02:07:12,583
Where's security?

1252
02:07:43,458 --> 02:07:48,167
Comrade, you want a ride 
 to West Germany?

1253
02:07:53,625 --> 02:07:55,000
I'm looking for

1254
02:07:55,167 --> 02:07:59,792
my monkey, Soni...

1255
02:07:59,917 --> 02:08:05,042
You haven't seen him by any chance, 
 have you?

1256
02:08:05,167 --> 02:08:07,917
You're looking for your monkey?

1257
02:08:08,042 --> 02:08:12,750
Yes, his name's Soni.

1258
02:08:31,042 --> 02:08:32,500
A horse!

1259
02:08:35,875 --> 02:08:38,750
Jovan, sunshine, that's a deer.

1260
02:08:38,875 --> 02:08:40,375
A deer?

1261
02:08:41,292 --> 02:08:43,000
That's how you drew horses.

1262
02:08:43,167 --> 02:08:44,750
It's a deer.

1263
02:08:53,417 --> 02:08:54,458
Jelena!

1264
02:08:57,333 --> 02:08:59,500
It can't be Jelena, sunshine.

1265
02:08:59,667 --> 02:09:02,333
Calm down, son, calm down!

1266
02:09:02,500 --> 02:09:03,833
What's that?

1267
02:09:06,000 --> 02:09:09,458
That's nothing. 
 Just a fish.

1268
02:09:09,625 --> 02:09:14,167
I fished 25-pounders right here 
 before the war.

1269
02:09:15,458 --> 02:09:17,292
God, I was really scared.

1270
02:09:17,417 --> 02:09:19,625
I was afraid for Jelena.

1271
02:09:19,750 --> 02:09:21,750
Don't be afraid, my boy.

1272
02:09:27,125 --> 02:09:29,542
I want to go back to the cellar.

1273
02:09:49,000 --> 02:09:52,042
Could anyone 
 start protecting us artists?

1274
02:09:52,167 --> 02:09:55,333
Could anyone look after us? 
 We work day and night

1275
02:09:55,500 --> 02:09:59,625
for our comrades! 
 And we go through hell!

1276
02:09:59,792 --> 02:10:01,250
Calm down.

1277
02:10:01,375 --> 02:10:03,125
What do you mean, calm down?

1278
02:10:03,250 --> 02:10:06,000
We could've been killed!

1279
02:10:07,042 --> 02:10:10,708
You do your job, 
 let me do mine.

1280
02:10:10,833 --> 02:10:13,125
I can't do my job!

1281
02:10:13,292 --> 02:10:15,792
You must protect 
 my set and my life!

1282
02:10:15,917 --> 02:10:20,667
My life was in danger here!

1283
02:10:20,833 --> 02:10:22,917
I'll tell you...

1284
02:10:23,083 --> 02:10:26,125
I didn't want to in front of him. 
 He's responsible.

1285
02:10:26,292 --> 02:10:28,042
- It's his fault. 
 - Whose?

1286
02:10:28,208 --> 02:10:30,708
The director's. 
 Shouting all the time:

1287
02:10:30,833 --> 02:10:34,083
"Be natural! The more natural, 
 the more terrifying."

1288
02:10:34,250 --> 02:10:37,583
And what happened? 
 He got his natural and terrifying.

1289
02:10:39,833 --> 02:10:43,500
Honestly...

1290
02:11:29,917 --> 02:11:33,000
How beautiful this world is!

1291
02:11:33,167 --> 02:11:34,667
Congratulations!

1292
02:12:05,292 --> 02:12:07,417
Careful, dad, you'll drown!

1293
02:12:12,792 --> 02:12:14,042
Come for a swim.

1294
02:12:19,292 --> 02:12:21,667
Come on, sunshine!

1295
02:12:21,792 --> 02:12:25,917
Come on in! 
 Do you hear me?

1296
02:12:26,083 --> 02:12:27,500
Jovan, my son!

1297
02:12:29,542 --> 02:12:31,333
Come on!

1298
02:12:31,458 --> 02:12:33,250
I can't swim, dad!

1299
02:13:54,667 --> 02:13:57,167
Don't be afraid, son.

1300
02:13:57,333 --> 02:13:58,500
Dad's here.

1301
02:13:59,875 --> 02:14:02,208
Come on, swim!

1302
02:14:05,542 --> 02:14:09,875
First your leg! 
 Then your arm!

1303
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:14,917
First left! Then right!

1304
02:14:17,542 --> 02:14:21,083
- I'm swimming! 
 - Of course, I'm holding you.

1305
02:14:21,250 --> 02:14:22,833
Close your mouth!

1306
02:15:45,083 --> 02:15:47,708
Where is the kid now?

1307
02:15:47,833 --> 02:15:49,542
He really gets on my nerves!

1308
02:16:06,500 --> 02:16:08,458
Son!

1309
02:16:45,042 --> 02:16:47,125
There is no life for us 
 in this country.

1310
02:16:47,792 --> 02:16:49,333
No, my love...

1311
02:17:06,583 --> 02:17:11,458
We can't go on living...

1312
02:17:11,625 --> 02:17:14,042
with lunatics...

1313
02:17:14,167 --> 02:17:16,833
madmen...

1314
02:17:17,000 --> 02:17:19,208
psychopaths...

1315
02:17:19,375 --> 02:17:20,667
maniacs...

1316
02:17:20,833 --> 02:17:22,583
liars...

1317
02:17:22,750 --> 02:17:24,625
thieves...

1318
02:17:24,792 --> 02:17:26,042
criminals...

1319
02:17:26,167 --> 02:17:27,250
murderers...

1320
02:17:27,375 --> 02:17:28,542
Can we?

1321
02:17:29,208 --> 02:17:30,208
No, we can't.

1322
02:17:33,208 --> 02:17:34,250
We can't, my love.

1323
02:17:38,708 --> 02:17:39,750
There.

1324
02:17:43,250 --> 02:17:47,792
There's no place 
 for an honest man in this country.

1325
02:17:47,917 --> 02:17:49,417
No place at all.

1326
02:17:50,208 --> 02:17:51,292
Under the bearing wall!

1327
02:18:52,583 --> 02:18:54,333
Are you sure?

1328
02:18:55,500 --> 02:18:56,792
I'm sure.

1329
02:19:23,000 --> 02:19:26,250
Marko Dren's disappearance coincided

1330
02:19:26,417 --> 02:19:28,750
with the loss of the secret formula

1331
02:19:28,917 --> 02:19:30,917
of Tito's Yugoslavia.

1332
02:19:31,042 --> 02:19:33,333
Tito, having lost his friend,

1333
02:19:33,500 --> 02:19:34,958
fell ill.

1334
02:19:35,083 --> 02:19:37,583
Twenty years later, he died...

1335
02:22:02,167 --> 02:22:05,042
Part Three - The War

1336
02:22:05,125 --> 02:22:07,917
1992 - Berlin. 
 Ivan still hoped to see Soni...

1337
02:22:13,042 --> 02:22:14,250
Mircovic,

1338
02:22:14,417 --> 02:22:17,458
where did this marvel come from?

1339
02:22:17,625 --> 02:22:19,458
Officially, he's dead.

1340
02:22:19,583 --> 02:22:22,708
Dead? 
 On the contrary, he looks good.

1341
02:22:22,833 --> 02:22:24,625
You said officially?

1342
02:22:24,792 --> 02:22:26,458
The Yugoslav embassy says so.

1343
02:22:27,583 --> 02:22:32,917
A man bearing the same name 
 died in 1941

1344
02:22:33,042 --> 02:22:36,500
during the bombing of Belgrade.

1345
02:22:36,625 --> 02:22:39,750
He was the zoo-keeper.

1346
02:22:39,875 --> 02:22:41,750
Do you know if...

1347
02:22:41,875 --> 02:22:43,042
Look

1348
02:22:43,208 --> 02:22:44,708
what he drew for me.

1349
02:22:44,875 --> 02:22:46,917
If he was an Indian,

1350
02:22:47,042 --> 02:22:50,542
they'd call him 
 He Who Surrenders.

1351
02:22:51,875 --> 02:22:54,458
He told me unbelievable things.

1352
02:22:54,583 --> 02:22:55,667
He says

1353
02:22:55,792 --> 02:22:58,083
he lived the whole time in a cellar.

1354
02:22:58,250 --> 02:23:00,708
Communism was one big cellar.

1355
02:23:00,833 --> 02:23:02,500
The whole planet

1356
02:23:02,667 --> 02:23:03,833
is a cellar.

1357
02:23:04,000 --> 02:23:06,167
I'm going to Portugal this summer.

1358
02:23:06,292 --> 02:23:10,667
Perhaps he could show me 
 an underground motorway.

1359
02:23:13,417 --> 02:23:15,250
Happy New Year!

1360
02:23:21,250 --> 02:23:23,250
Happy New Year, lvan!

1361
02:23:23,417 --> 02:23:24,750
It isn't for me!

1362
02:23:24,917 --> 02:23:28,958
Why do you cry all the time?

1363
02:23:29,125 --> 02:23:32,792
I want to go home 
 to Yugoslavia!

1364
02:23:32,917 --> 02:23:36,292
There's a war over there. 
 A horrifying war!

1365
02:23:36,458 --> 02:23:37,917
I know.

1366
02:23:38,083 --> 02:23:40,042
Not the war you're thinking of.

1367
02:23:40,208 --> 02:23:44,208
In our country, 
 there's only our war.

1368
02:23:44,375 --> 02:23:47,917
World War II ended 50 years ago.

1369
02:23:48,042 --> 02:23:50,000
And the Germans won.

1370
02:23:50,125 --> 02:23:51,917
No, they didn't, they lost.

1371
02:23:52,042 --> 02:23:56,167
So why are they celebrating?

1372
02:23:57,458 --> 02:24:01,167
You're lying to me, doctor.

1373
02:24:01,333 --> 02:24:03,125
You work for the Germans.

1374
02:24:03,292 --> 02:24:05,417
You work for them, don't you?

1375
02:24:05,583 --> 02:24:08,292
Yes, I work for them 
 but not those Germans.

1376
02:24:10,625 --> 02:24:12,292
You're a traitor!

1377
02:24:12,458 --> 02:24:15,833
What am I? 
 A traitor?

1378
02:24:19,833 --> 02:24:21,750
I'll show who the traitor is!

1379
02:24:21,917 --> 02:24:25,167
I didn't want to show you this

1380
02:24:25,292 --> 02:24:28,375
but look for yourself.

1381
02:24:28,500 --> 02:24:32,333
Who's on these Interpol warrants? 
 Look.

1382
02:24:32,458 --> 02:24:34,125
Who?

1383
02:24:34,292 --> 02:24:38,292
My brother Marko and Natalija.

1384
02:24:38,417 --> 02:24:41,083
They're wanted by the police 
 throughout the world.

1385
02:24:42,500 --> 02:24:46,292
They killed some people in a cellar, traded 
 arms...

1386
02:24:46,458 --> 02:24:49,333
The crates were stamped 
 with a monkey.

1387
02:24:49,458 --> 02:24:51,208
Your Soni, maybe.

1388
02:24:56,333 --> 02:24:57,792
Where are you going?

1389
02:24:57,958 --> 02:24:59,000
lvan!

1390
02:25:08,000 --> 02:25:09,542
What's wrong?

1391
02:25:09,708 --> 02:25:13,542
He lied to me!

1392
02:25:13,708 --> 02:25:15,208
Who lied to you?

1393
02:25:15,375 --> 02:25:19,750
My own brother!

1394
02:25:37,333 --> 02:25:39,417
Don't do anything stupid!

1395
02:25:39,542 --> 02:25:41,583
lvan, we're not children! 
 Let's go back!

1396
02:25:44,917 --> 02:25:46,667
Come back!

1397
02:25:49,208 --> 02:25:51,208
Oh, fuck it!

1398
02:25:55,292 --> 02:25:56,833
Stop messing around!

1399
02:25:56,958 --> 02:25:58,417
Come back!

1400
02:26:28,708 --> 02:26:30,125
Wait for me!

1401
02:26:37,250 --> 02:26:38,958
I can't...

1402
02:26:39,083 --> 02:26:41,292
I can't go on!

1403
02:26:41,458 --> 02:26:42,667
I'll die!

1404
02:26:44,208 --> 02:26:45,250
Wait!

1405
02:27:24,500 --> 02:27:25,833
Stop, for God's sake!

1406
02:27:25,958 --> 02:27:28,000
Which way to Italy?

1407
02:27:28,125 --> 02:27:31,083
We don't know. We're lost too. 
 Where did you come from?

1408
02:27:31,208 --> 02:27:33,292
Bosnia. Where are you going?

1409
02:27:33,458 --> 02:27:36,375
To Yugoslavia.

1410
02:27:36,500 --> 02:27:37,708
No Yugoslavia!

1411
02:27:37,875 --> 02:27:41,375
What do you mean?

1412
02:27:42,458 --> 02:27:44,250
There's no more Yugoslavia!

1413
02:27:44,417 --> 02:27:45,417
Can we come?

1414
02:27:45,542 --> 02:27:49,417
Yes, if you pay DM 1,000. 
 They paid as well.

1415
02:27:52,583 --> 02:27:55,000
Ivan, wait!

1416
02:27:58,333 --> 02:28:00,042
Let's go to Italy!

1417
02:28:00,167 --> 02:28:02,083
We'll eat spaghetti!

1418
02:28:02,208 --> 02:28:05,667
We'll drink wine! 
 Let's go with these people!

1419
02:28:05,792 --> 02:28:10,375
What does he mean, 
 no Yugoslavia?

1420
02:28:10,500 --> 02:28:12,667
I've had enough, lvan.

1421
02:28:12,792 --> 02:28:15,958
I'm going to Italy 
 or to fucking hell!

1422
02:28:16,500 --> 02:28:19,000
I can't go on! 
 Take care.

1423
02:28:19,125 --> 02:28:21,000
Wait!

1424
02:28:21,125 --> 02:28:22,750
Wait for me!

1425
02:28:27,167 --> 02:28:29,750
Take care, lvan!

1426
02:29:21,917 --> 02:29:23,583
Where...

1427
02:29:23,750 --> 02:29:27,167
have you been?

1428
02:30:05,000 --> 02:30:06,667
Blood...

1429
02:30:36,708 --> 02:30:38,542
Has anyone seen my Jovan?

1430
02:30:38,708 --> 02:30:40,583
No.

1431
02:30:43,250 --> 02:30:45,292
Load!

1432
02:30:52,833 --> 02:30:53,875
Fire!

1433
02:30:56,458 --> 02:30:57,958
Nowhere to be found...

1434
02:31:01,208 --> 02:31:04,542
Fucking fascist motherfuckers!

1435
02:31:33,833 --> 02:31:38,500
I don't have time to bargain, 
 to haggle over percentages.

1436
02:31:41,500 --> 02:31:45,417
I've come here to help you, 
 independently

1437
02:31:45,583 --> 02:31:49,000
of our religious, national 
 and political differences.

1438
02:31:49,167 --> 02:31:52,458
But I ask only one thing of you: 
 please don't shout.

1439
02:31:52,583 --> 02:31:57,292
We'll reach an agreement 
 in a civilized, educated way.

1440
02:32:03,583 --> 02:32:06,000
You need me, 
 not the other way round.

1441
02:32:08,167 --> 02:32:09,875
Don't worry.

1442
02:32:10,000 --> 02:32:13,458
The Serbs kill the Croats 
 and the Croats kill the Serbs.

1443
02:32:13,583 --> 02:32:14,833
Don't be afraid.

1444
02:32:15,000 --> 02:32:16,792
You're too kind.

1445
02:32:16,917 --> 02:32:18,083
Don't mention it.

1446
02:32:18,208 --> 02:32:20,875
You're young, kid. 
 You don't understand.

1447
02:32:21,042 --> 02:32:26,792
I do, but you've been abroad too long. 
 You don't understand our language.

1448
02:32:26,958 --> 02:32:31,042
You're asking too much. 
 Understand? Too much.

1449
02:32:31,167 --> 02:32:34,000
I'm asking the minimum.

1450
02:32:34,125 --> 02:32:36,042
DM 3 per bullet?

1451
02:32:36,167 --> 02:32:37,208
Minimum!

1452
02:32:37,375 --> 02:32:38,375
$100 per grenade?

1453
02:32:38,500 --> 02:32:40,750
Buy from Hungarians, 
 you fucker!

1454
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,333
lvan...

1455
02:33:16,458 --> 02:33:17,958
My brother!

1456
02:33:20,875 --> 02:33:22,625
What are you doing, lvan?

1457
02:33:24,667 --> 02:33:28,250
Have you gone mad? 
 It's a sin to kill your brother!

1458
02:33:28,958 --> 02:33:30,708
The greatest sin!

1459
02:33:30,875 --> 02:33:33,250
Don't, lvan!

1460
02:33:35,042 --> 02:33:38,625
Forgive me, lvan!

1461
02:33:38,792 --> 02:33:40,042
I saved your life three times.

1462
02:33:46,333 --> 02:33:48,583
I saved your life three times!

1463
02:33:49,708 --> 02:33:51,708
It hurts! lvan, don't!

1464
02:33:52,083 --> 02:33:53,875
Forgive me, lvan.

1465
02:33:54,583 --> 02:33:56,792
God sees everything, lvan.

1466
02:33:59,042 --> 02:34:00,792
God will punish you.

1467
02:34:00,958 --> 02:34:02,792
He'll punish you!

1468
02:34:16,042 --> 02:34:18,000
Lord, forgive me.

1469
02:35:29,292 --> 02:35:31,000
What are you doing?

1470
02:35:53,792 --> 02:35:54,833
My love...

1471
02:35:59,292 --> 02:36:02,500
"No war...

1472
02:36:02,625 --> 02:36:04,458
"is a war...

1473
02:36:04,583 --> 02:36:07,042
"until a brother...

1474
02:36:07,208 --> 02:36:08,833
"kills his brother."

1475
02:36:16,292 --> 02:36:19,375
My love!

1476
02:36:30,917 --> 02:36:33,792
Come on, you old hag!

1477
02:36:35,000 --> 02:36:37,500
Young man, this is my husband.

1478
02:36:37,625 --> 02:36:39,375
Move when I tell you to!

1479
02:36:39,917 --> 02:36:42,833
What are you waiting for? 
 Get down!

1480
02:36:49,958 --> 02:36:54,083
Comrade Commander, we've captured 
 16 Chetniks, 30 Ustashas

1481
02:36:54,208 --> 02:36:56,333
and 3 UN men.

1482
02:36:56,458 --> 02:37:01,583
Plus two war profiteers 
 with a Mercedes.

1483
02:37:01,708 --> 02:37:03,583
What do we do with them?

1484
02:37:03,708 --> 02:37:06,167
Profiteers...

1485
02:37:07,333 --> 02:37:09,000
Execute them on the spot!

1486
02:37:53,917 --> 02:37:57,875
Comrade Blacky! 
 Pockets searched, soldiers disarmed.

1487
02:37:58,042 --> 02:38:01,833
The profiteers' passports... 
 What do I do with all these people?

1488
02:38:01,958 --> 02:38:03,375
Take them to the well.

1489
02:38:03,542 --> 02:38:04,667
Any sign of Jovan?

1490
02:38:04,792 --> 02:38:05,917
No.

1491
02:38:06,042 --> 02:38:07,833
No...

1492
02:38:08,917 --> 02:38:10,708
I protest, sir!

1493
02:38:10,875 --> 02:38:12,500
Me too, comrade!

1494
02:38:12,667 --> 02:38:14,292
I'm no "comrade", sir.

1495
02:38:14,458 --> 02:38:16,500
And I'm no "sir", comrade.

1496
02:38:16,625 --> 02:38:19,458
What are you? 
 Ustasha, Chetnik, partisan?

1497
02:38:19,625 --> 02:38:22,583
I'm Petar Popara Blacky.

1498
02:38:22,750 --> 02:38:24,792
Which army are you in, comrade?

1499
02:38:24,917 --> 02:38:26,125
My own!

1500
02:38:26,292 --> 02:38:28,708
Do you have a superior?

1501
02:38:28,875 --> 02:38:31,708
Yes, my country!

1502
02:38:31,833 --> 02:38:33,667
Fucking fascist motherfucker!

1503
02:38:45,208 --> 02:38:47,542
Marko, my brother!

1504
02:38:47,708 --> 02:38:49,708
Natalija...

1505
02:38:49,875 --> 02:38:51,625
my love!

1506
02:39:03,083 --> 02:39:05,042
I can't find Jovan.

1507
02:40:33,750 --> 02:40:35,542
See, my dear monkey.

1508
02:40:37,292 --> 02:40:38,833
Who would have thought it?

1509
02:40:39,542 --> 02:40:40,875
Nobody.

1510
02:40:44,083 --> 02:40:49,042
Imagine that you have a son,

1511
02:40:49,167 --> 02:40:50,500
a baby monkey.

1512
02:40:51,750 --> 02:40:53,542
And someone hides him from you...

1513
02:40:55,250 --> 02:40:57,333
And you search for him for years...

1514
02:40:57,500 --> 02:41:01,708
But you can't find him anywhere.

1515
02:41:01,875 --> 02:41:05,333
Say, isn't that sad?

1516
02:41:09,667 --> 02:41:12,333
And what a son I had!

1517
02:41:12,500 --> 02:41:14,417
Do you remember my Jovan?

1518
02:41:15,417 --> 02:41:16,958
What was he like?

1519
02:41:19,250 --> 02:41:20,917
A strong lad.

1520
02:41:21,083 --> 02:41:22,958
Just like me!

1521
02:41:26,500 --> 02:41:29,250
There is no more sun

1522
02:41:30,292 --> 02:41:34,667
There is no more moon...

1523
02:41:39,083 --> 02:41:40,417
Did you hear that?

1524
02:41:40,542 --> 02:41:41,625
Did you hear?

1525
02:41:42,542 --> 02:41:44,917
Jovan!

1526
02:41:45,083 --> 02:41:46,583
My son!

1527
02:42:00,958 --> 02:42:02,625
Light of my life!

1528
02:43:57,875 --> 02:44:00,042
Jovan, my son!

1529
02:44:00,917 --> 02:44:03,125
I knew I'd find you! I knew it!

1530
02:44:04,333 --> 02:44:05,792
Who organized this?

1531
02:44:05,917 --> 02:44:06,958
Mum did.

1532
02:44:09,958 --> 02:44:11,083
Here's to you!

1533
02:44:17,458 --> 02:44:18,708
My friend!

1534
02:44:18,875 --> 02:44:21,792
Did she really have to come?

1535
02:44:21,917 --> 02:44:24,917
She's my friend's wife! 
 Are you crazy?

1536
02:44:25,042 --> 02:44:26,792
I know what's what.

1537
02:44:26,917 --> 02:44:28,000
What do you know?

1538
02:44:28,125 --> 02:44:30,125
I'm not stupid.

1539
02:44:30,250 --> 02:44:31,458
They're married!

1540
02:44:43,333 --> 02:44:45,333
My friend!

1541
02:44:45,500 --> 02:44:47,792
Natalija is a little embarrassed.

1542
02:45:09,000 --> 02:45:10,542
Let me introduce you.

1543
02:45:10,667 --> 02:45:11,833
Meet my friend's wife!

1544
02:45:12,167 --> 02:45:14,000
Pleased to meet you.

1545
02:45:18,750 --> 02:45:20,083
Play louder!

1546
02:45:20,250 --> 02:45:22,375
That's it, Vera!

1547
02:45:41,417 --> 02:45:43,250
Let bygones be bygones.

1548
02:45:50,042 --> 02:45:52,042
He's grown so fast. 
 Look at him.

1549
02:45:52,167 --> 02:45:53,833
Big guy, isn't he?

1550
02:45:56,500 --> 02:45:59,042
Fifteen years, Vera.

1551
02:45:59,167 --> 02:46:01,333
What do you mean, fifteen? 
 Twenty!

1552
02:46:01,500 --> 02:46:02,625
No, fifteen.

1553
02:46:02,792 --> 02:46:04,083
- Twenty! 
 - Fifteen!

1554
02:46:04,250 --> 02:46:05,333
Twenty!

1555
02:46:05,458 --> 02:46:07,667
I know my own son's age!

1556
02:46:09,708 --> 02:46:11,667
My sunshine!

1557
02:46:13,500 --> 02:46:14,833
Sister!

1558
02:46:15,000 --> 02:46:17,833
Bato! My sweet brother!

1559
02:46:17,958 --> 02:46:20,458
You're dancing!

1560
02:46:20,625 --> 02:46:22,958
Marko, look, he's dancing!

1561
02:46:23,083 --> 02:46:24,583
Look, Marko!

1562
02:46:24,708 --> 02:46:26,208
Let's dance together!

1563
02:46:34,083 --> 02:46:35,458
Forgive me?

1564
02:46:35,583 --> 02:46:38,667
I can forgive 
 but I cannot forget.

1565
02:46:44,417 --> 02:46:47,167
Here we built new houses

1566
02:46:47,292 --> 02:46:50,958
with red roofs 
 and chimneys where storks will nest.

1567
02:46:51,083 --> 02:46:54,208
With wide-open doors 
 for dear guests.

1568
02:46:54,333 --> 02:46:59,125
We'll thank the soil for feeding us 
 and the sun for warming us.

1569
02:46:59,250 --> 02:47:02,875
And the fields for reminding us 
 of the green grass of home.

1570
02:47:03,042 --> 02:47:08,208
With pain, sorrow and joy, 
 we shall remember our country,

1571
02:47:08,333 --> 02:47:12,625
as we tell our children 
 stories that start like fairytales:

1572
02:47:12,750 --> 02:47:15,708
Once upon a time, 
 there was a country...

1573
02:48:02,125 --> 02:48:06,875
This story has no end...
