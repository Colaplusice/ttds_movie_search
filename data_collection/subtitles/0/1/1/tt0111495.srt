1
00:01:11,412 --> 00:01:14,347
THREE COLORS
RED

2
00:01:37,005 --> 00:01:38,666
Come here.

3
00:02:19,614 --> 00:02:21,946
320 04 86--

4
00:02:21,983 --> 00:02:25,919
Leave your name and number,
and I'll get back to you.

5
00:02:28,156 --> 00:02:30,021
Valentine?

6
00:02:30,058 --> 00:02:31,753
Valentine?

7
00:02:31,793 --> 00:02:35,229
Are you home? Are you there?

8
00:02:35,263 --> 00:02:36,924
I'll call back later.

9
00:02:36,964 --> 00:02:41,424
Michel...
I was having breakfast.

10
00:02:41,469 --> 00:02:44,597
First it was busy,
now the machine. Are you alone?

11
00:02:44,639 --> 00:02:47,199
- Alone.
- All alone?

12
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:51,769
All alone. They just called me
for a photo session.

13
00:02:51,813 --> 00:02:54,179
They want to see me.

14
00:02:54,215 --> 00:02:57,207
- When did you get back?
- Yesterday.

15
00:02:57,251 --> 00:02:59,378
I called, but you weren't home.

16
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:02,389
Our car was stolen in Poland.
They got everything:

17
00:03:02,423 --> 00:03:05,324
passports, money, clothes...

18
00:03:05,359 --> 00:03:07,418
So what happened?

19
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:09,623
We found a nice guy
who put us up.

20
00:03:09,664 --> 00:03:12,656
The embassy gave us money
and passports. We made it home.

21
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:14,190
Michel?

22
00:03:16,270 --> 00:03:18,261
I felt lonely last night.

23
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:21,806
What did you do?

24
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:27,111
All night long
I slept with your jacket.

25
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:32,279
I wanted to be with you.

26
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:34,720
I can't now, Valentine.

27
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:38,157
I know.
What's the weather like there?

28
00:03:38,192 --> 00:03:40,524
Typical English weather:
it's pouring.

29
00:03:40,561 --> 00:03:43,394
It rained here yesterday.

30
00:03:43,431 --> 00:03:46,730
Now it's sunny.
It's springtime.

31
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,531
What did you do last night?

32
00:03:48,569 --> 00:03:52,630
I took your advice and saw
"Dead Poets Society."

33
00:03:52,673 --> 00:03:55,005
- What a good movie!
- I liked it a lot.

34
00:03:55,042 --> 00:03:56,339
I'll call you tonight.

35
00:03:56,377 --> 00:03:59,346
I'll be back at 7:00.
I'll stay in.

36
00:03:59,380 --> 00:04:01,473
- I'll talk to you later.
- Michel.

37
00:04:03,684 --> 00:04:06,448
- I miss you.
- Me, too.

38
00:04:18,266 --> 00:04:20,666
Personal weather reports.

39
00:04:59,774 --> 00:05:02,470
Hello.

40
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,750
Lose?

41
00:05:18,359 --> 00:05:20,020
Take that out.

42
00:05:22,396 --> 00:05:24,057
Take your sweater.

43
00:05:26,767 --> 00:05:29,964
Tie it around your neck.

44
00:05:30,004 --> 00:05:33,064
- The sleeve, too.
- Like this?

45
00:05:33,107 --> 00:05:34,768
Give me a profile.

46
00:05:36,410 --> 00:05:38,640
No, don't smile.

47
00:05:38,679 --> 00:05:41,614
Be sad.

48
00:05:41,649 --> 00:05:44,140
Sadder.
Think of something awful.

49
00:05:44,185 --> 00:05:45,652
There.

50
00:05:45,686 --> 00:05:47,119
Sad.

51
00:05:47,154 --> 00:05:50,385
Now it's coming. That's it!

52
00:05:50,424 --> 00:05:53,450
Turn. And six and seven
on the bar.

53
00:05:53,494 --> 00:05:57,362
And one and two and three
and four and stretch...

54
00:05:57,398 --> 00:06:00,993
and six and seven
and eight and bend...

55
00:06:01,102 --> 00:06:03,662
and three and four and arch...

56
00:06:03,704 --> 00:06:08,573
and six and seven and stretch
and stretch and stretch.

57
00:06:08,609 --> 00:06:12,705
Stretch out your chin,
your arm, your fingertips.

58
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:16,774
Stretch out your hand,
your neck.

59
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:20,776
Relax your toes. Stretch.

60
00:07:09,470 --> 00:07:11,438
I almost fell.

61
00:13:27,881 --> 00:13:31,783
Excuse me...the door was open.

62
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:36,379
I'm sorry. I ran over your dog.

63
00:13:38,592 --> 00:13:42,426
Rita. A German shepherd.

64
00:13:42,463 --> 00:13:43,896
That's possible.

65
00:13:43,931 --> 00:13:46,456
She disappeared yesterday.

66
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,798
She's in my car...alive.

67
00:13:48,836 --> 00:13:51,066
I don't know what to do.

68
00:13:55,509 --> 00:13:59,343
Should I take her
to a veterinarian?

69
00:14:01,048 --> 00:14:02,572
As you wish.

70
00:14:04,651 --> 00:14:07,176
If I ran over your daughter...

71
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:09,553
would you be so indifferent?

72
00:14:11,125 --> 00:14:13,320
I have no daughter, miss.

73
00:14:17,531 --> 00:14:18,862
Go away.

74
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:26,504
Don't close the door!

75
00:15:20,894 --> 00:15:23,556
She's fine. We stitched her up.

76
00:15:23,597 --> 00:15:26,293
Otherwise,
she has a few bruises.

77
00:15:27,301 --> 00:15:29,633
She'll need some rest.

78
00:15:29,670 --> 00:15:31,695
She's pregnant.

79
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:35,170
Will you take her
or leave her here?

80
00:15:35,209 --> 00:15:37,370
I'll take her.

81
00:15:37,411 --> 00:15:40,107
We'll help you carry her.

82
00:15:40,147 --> 00:15:42,775
Marc? Marc?

83
00:15:53,961 --> 00:15:55,519
Are you alone?

84
00:15:55,562 --> 00:15:57,086
No.

85
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:00,566
Tell him something.

86
00:16:05,739 --> 00:16:07,673
Did you hear? I have a dog.

87
00:16:07,708 --> 00:16:10,939
A dog. I ran her over.

88
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:15,805
Michel, I'm sorry.

89
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,146
That wasn't funny.

90
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:18,674
No, it wasn't.

91
00:16:18,719 --> 00:16:22,246
I knew it was a joke.
I could see you laughing.

92
00:16:22,289 --> 00:16:24,553
Do you remember how we met?

93
00:16:24,591 --> 00:16:25,922
I remember.

94
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,422
We're lucky I stepped out
during the break.

95
00:16:31,465 --> 00:16:33,956
That's true.

96
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:37,596
- Valentine, return the dog.
- I tried.

97
00:16:37,638 --> 00:16:40,869
- The owner doesn't want it.
- Who is he?

98
00:16:42,442 --> 00:16:44,433
I hear an alarm.

99
00:16:47,814 --> 00:16:49,475
It's my car.

100
00:16:51,018 --> 00:16:52,883
Wait for me to turn it off.

101
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:55,616
- I'm in a rush.
- I understand.

102
00:17:21,949 --> 00:17:24,611
Move. Move.

103
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:41,563
They prefer these.

104
00:17:43,570 --> 00:17:48,667
They'll use the slogan:
"A Breath of Life."

105
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:51,109
Which do you prefer?

106
00:17:58,685 --> 00:18:00,050
I like this one.

107
00:18:00,087 --> 00:18:01,520
Me, too.

108
00:18:07,294 --> 00:18:08,852
Twenty-five by sixty-five feet.

109
00:18:10,931 --> 00:18:13,263
Will people recognize you?

110
00:18:15,969 --> 00:18:17,869
Who?

111
00:18:26,947 --> 00:18:28,608
What are you thinking of?

112
00:18:40,827 --> 00:18:43,022
Not you.

113
00:19:35,549 --> 00:19:37,676
That's a bad sign.

114
00:19:37,718 --> 00:19:40,551
I think I know why I won.
Good-bye.

115
00:19:40,587 --> 00:19:41,918
So long.

116
00:20:21,828 --> 00:20:26,959
You're back already.
The mailman left money for you.

117
00:20:29,069 --> 00:20:31,970
- Who sent it?
- I have no idea.

118
00:20:33,073 --> 00:20:36,201
Is that your brother?

119
00:20:38,311 --> 00:20:40,142
Or someone who looks like him.

120
00:20:40,180 --> 00:20:43,946
What a shame. Does your family
read this paper?

121
00:20:45,585 --> 00:20:47,450
I don't know. Thank you.

122
00:20:47,487 --> 00:20:48,647
Good-bye.

123
00:21:18,952 --> 00:21:22,285
Can I speak to Marie, please?

124
00:21:25,358 --> 00:21:29,089
It's Valentine.
Will you see Marc soon?

125
00:21:29,129 --> 00:21:30,619
Tonight, probably.

126
00:21:32,265 --> 00:21:34,893
Tell him to call me
at any hour.

127
00:21:43,810 --> 00:21:46,244
I'll let you run around.

128
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,874
But don't run away.

129
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:51,247
You promise?

130
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:55,051
Go on.

131
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:31,724
Excuse me. My dog ran away.

132
00:23:28,515 --> 00:23:31,814
Call her. She's yours.

133
00:24:01,548 --> 00:24:03,709
- Was it you?
- For the vet.

134
00:24:03,750 --> 00:24:06,617
- You found my address?
- That was easy.

135
00:24:08,088 --> 00:24:10,989
You don't know the prices.

136
00:24:11,992 --> 00:24:13,550
It cost
a hundred and thirty francs.

137
00:24:15,028 --> 00:24:17,656
You sent me six hundred.

138
00:24:26,973 --> 00:24:28,998
Wait. I'll get the change.

139
00:24:32,746 --> 00:24:34,441
What about Rita?

140
00:24:34,481 --> 00:24:37,678
She's a very intelligent dog.

141
00:24:37,717 --> 00:24:39,412
Take her.

142
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:42,546
- You don't want her?
- I want nothing.

143
00:24:44,591 --> 00:24:46,559
Then stop breathing.

144
00:24:47,894 --> 00:24:49,555
Good idea.

145
00:25:47,153 --> 00:25:49,485
You don't breathe anymore?

146
00:26:05,205 --> 00:26:08,800
If you don't come,
you'll never see me again.

147
00:26:08,842 --> 00:26:11,640
But today is Sunday.

148
00:26:11,678 --> 00:26:15,136
Yesterday was Saturday,
and we were together.

149
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:19,675
I'm sorry, sir.
We're about to have lunch.

150
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:23,314
I ask one thing of you:
don't call me "sir."

151
00:26:23,356 --> 00:26:26,985
Talk to me like yesterday.
Call me Pierrot.

152
00:26:27,026 --> 00:26:30,553
Call me "my love."
Say "my love."

153
00:26:30,597 --> 00:26:32,895
Sir, let me change rooms.

154
00:26:47,113 --> 00:26:49,673
- Pierre, I'm alone now.
- So am I.

155
00:26:49,716 --> 00:26:51,377
Far from you.

156
00:26:51,417 --> 00:26:54,716
I want you to come.
I can't be alone.

157
00:26:56,289 --> 00:26:59,383
I saw you yesterday.
I miss you, too.

158
00:26:59,425 --> 00:27:01,723
- Understand that.
- I don't want to.

159
00:27:01,761 --> 00:27:03,661
I'm thinking of you.

160
00:27:03,696 --> 00:27:05,630
You're naked
in front of the mirror.

161
00:27:05,665 --> 00:27:08,725
But for someone else,
not for me.

162
00:27:08,768 --> 00:27:12,101
I want to kiss you.
Lean forward.

163
00:27:12,138 --> 00:27:14,470
I touch your lips...

164
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:16,998
What are you doing?

165
00:27:22,615 --> 00:27:25,243
- I'm spying.
- What?

166
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,887
I'm listening
to my neighbors' phone calls.

167
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:37,590
You cut it off just
as it was getting interesting.

168
00:27:41,501 --> 00:27:44,095
You don't find it entertaining?

169
00:27:44,137 --> 00:27:46,697
- It's disgusting.
- Yes.

170
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,832
What's more, it's illegal.

171
00:27:51,911 --> 00:27:53,572
Your thirty francs.

172
00:27:59,085 --> 00:28:01,986
One minute, miss.

173
00:28:06,459 --> 00:28:09,451
You're persuaded you are right.

174
00:28:09,495 --> 00:28:11,429
Yes.

175
00:28:11,464 --> 00:28:14,661
Then why don't you do anything?

176
00:28:14,701 --> 00:28:16,669
What?

177
00:28:17,804 --> 00:28:20,432
Can't I touch your scar...

178
00:28:20,473 --> 00:28:22,100
like yesterday?

179
00:28:26,546 --> 00:28:29,014
Go see this man.

180
00:28:29,048 --> 00:28:32,381
Tell him someone listens
to his conversations.

181
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:37,813
While you're at it,
tell him it's me.

182
00:28:37,857 --> 00:28:39,654
I will.

183
00:28:42,629 --> 00:28:44,290
It's that house.

184
00:28:52,005 --> 00:28:53,495
May I see your husband?

185
00:28:53,539 --> 00:28:55,837
He's upstairs on the phone.

186
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,866
Let me shut off the gas.

187
00:29:02,115 --> 00:29:03,776
Come in, please.

188
00:29:31,778 --> 00:29:33,177
Have a seat.

189
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:34,372
He'll be right down.

190
00:29:34,414 --> 00:29:35,642
Caroline...

191
00:29:35,682 --> 00:29:39,379
don't play with the telephone.
Daddy's talking.

192
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,650
Excuse me.
I'm at the wrong address.

193
00:29:42,689 --> 00:29:44,156
This is number twenty-two.

194
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:45,885
I'm very sorry.

195
00:29:45,925 --> 00:29:47,916
No problem.

196
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,257
Have a nice day.

197
00:30:28,701 --> 00:30:29,861
Good-bye.

198
00:30:29,902 --> 00:30:31,927
I'll call you later.

199
00:30:43,983 --> 00:30:45,814
You lost this.

200
00:31:00,166 --> 00:31:03,761
So, did you tell him?

201
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,503
Would you like
something to drink?

202
00:31:12,545 --> 00:31:14,206
No, I wouldn't.

203
00:31:17,617 --> 00:31:20,085
I came back...

204
00:31:20,119 --> 00:31:23,247
I came back
to ask you something.

205
00:31:24,323 --> 00:31:25,620
Don't do this anymore.

206
00:31:27,994 --> 00:31:30,656
I've done it all my life.

207
00:31:47,513 --> 00:31:49,879
What were you?

208
00:31:49,916 --> 00:31:51,247
A cop?

209
00:31:51,284 --> 00:31:54,481
Worse. A judge.

210
00:32:01,594 --> 00:32:02,822
A judge?

211
00:32:02,862 --> 00:32:05,353
You've never seen one for real?

212
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,433
Would you like to try?

213
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,967
It makes a lovely sound.

214
00:32:24,951 --> 00:32:28,853
I don't know whether I was
on the good or the bad side.

215
00:32:28,888 --> 00:32:35,020
Here, at least,
I know where the truth is.

216
00:32:35,061 --> 00:32:38,292
My point of view is better
than in a courtroom.

217
00:32:38,331 --> 00:32:39,764
No.

218
00:32:41,033 --> 00:32:43,627
Everyone deserves
a private life.

219
00:32:43,669 --> 00:32:45,694
Of course.

220
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:51,576
Why did you stop short?
Why didn't you tell him?

221
00:32:54,981 --> 00:32:58,041
Because he has a sweet wife...

222
00:32:58,084 --> 00:33:00,245
devoted to him?

223
00:33:00,286 --> 00:33:03,653
And a little daughter
who loves him.

224
00:33:03,689 --> 00:33:06,214
So you couldn't?

225
00:33:06,259 --> 00:33:08,853
Did you feel remorse...

226
00:33:08,895 --> 00:33:12,058
or were you afraid to do harm?

227
00:33:12,098 --> 00:33:14,362
Maybe both.

228
00:33:16,836 --> 00:33:19,327
Let me tell you.

229
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:23,035
It matters little
whether I spy or you tell them.

230
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:26,569
Sooner or later...

231
00:33:26,612 --> 00:33:29,638
he'll jump out a window...

232
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:33,641
or she'll find out everything.

233
00:33:33,686 --> 00:33:39,249
Someone will tell their daughter
and it will be living hell.

234
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,922
What can we do about it?

235
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,959
Why are you so quiet?

236
00:33:51,370 --> 00:33:53,429
Does this remind you
of something?

237
00:33:53,472 --> 00:33:55,633
- Yes.
- What?

238
00:33:55,675 --> 00:33:57,336
Say it.

239
00:33:59,211 --> 00:34:01,475
A boy I know.

240
00:34:01,514 --> 00:34:04,574
A boy you know who...

241
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:08,311
found out his mother
was a whore?

242
00:34:11,691 --> 00:34:13,352
Who learned...

243
00:34:14,794 --> 00:34:18,093
he's not his father's son.

244
00:34:18,130 --> 00:34:19,791
He was fifteen.

245
00:34:23,302 --> 00:34:25,634
That man's daughter...

246
00:34:28,407 --> 00:34:31,069
she knows, too.

247
00:34:31,110 --> 00:34:32,771
Stay a minute.

248
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:39,307
Why?

249
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:43,979
The light is beautiful.

250
00:34:51,530 --> 00:34:53,794
Personal weather reports.

251
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:56,427
I'm driving to Turin tomorrow.

252
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,563
I checked. The weather
will be fine to Chamonix.

253
00:34:59,605 --> 00:35:03,006
From Chamonix to the tunnel,
it may snow.

254
00:35:03,042 --> 00:35:06,102
And after the tunnel...
one minute...

255
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:09,637
I know the weather
all over Europe.

256
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:11,513
Up to Turin,
the weather will be fine.

257
00:35:11,550 --> 00:35:13,814
Leave early to avoid the snow.

258
00:35:13,853 --> 00:35:15,878
This service is a great idea.

259
00:35:15,921 --> 00:35:17,912
Thank you. Good-bye.

260
00:35:32,338 --> 00:35:35,899
Personal weather reports.

261
00:35:35,941 --> 00:35:38,569
It's me.

262
00:35:38,611 --> 00:35:41,171
- Did you get any sleep?
- A little.

263
00:35:41,213 --> 00:35:45,616
I didn't tell you.
By telephone it may be easier.

264
00:35:45,651 --> 00:35:48,245
It was really great.

265
00:35:48,287 --> 00:35:51,916
We'd never made love
so well, so long.

266
00:35:51,957 --> 00:35:57,156
We learned something.
Me from you. You from me.

267
00:35:57,196 --> 00:36:00,996
When I woke up, you were
still sleeping. Like a child.

268
00:36:01,033 --> 00:36:03,092
- I'm older than you.
- One year.

269
00:36:03,135 --> 00:36:05,262
- No, two.
- OK, two.

270
00:36:05,304 --> 00:36:10,435
When I saw you, I got scared.
What is this leading to?

271
00:36:10,476 --> 00:36:13,240
You sound a little down.

272
00:36:13,279 --> 00:36:15,008
Are you nervous
about your exams?

273
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:18,539
About what I'm going to do.
Will it be enough for you?

274
00:36:18,584 --> 00:36:20,279
Why not go bowling?

275
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:23,550
I opened all my books.

276
00:36:23,589 --> 00:36:25,955
- Maybe. Do you have a coin?
- Yes.

277
00:36:25,991 --> 00:36:29,984
Flip it. Tails is bowling.
Heads is penal code.

278
00:36:35,601 --> 00:36:37,660
Tails. Bowling.

279
00:36:37,703 --> 00:36:39,796
I'll work for an hour,
then I'll call you.

280
00:36:39,839 --> 00:36:41,136
Or I will.

281
00:36:41,173 --> 00:36:44,506
I'll wait. If I go out,
it's just to buy cigarettes.

282
00:36:51,951 --> 00:36:53,543
You didn't listen?

283
00:36:57,289 --> 00:37:01,453
What a shame. It was romantic.

284
00:37:01,494 --> 00:37:03,985
I heard the beginning.

285
00:37:04,029 --> 00:37:05,326
They're in love.

286
00:37:07,166 --> 00:37:09,327
Yes.

287
00:37:09,368 --> 00:37:12,303
He hasn't met
the right woman yet.

288
00:37:13,873 --> 00:37:15,841
How do you know?

289
00:37:15,875 --> 00:37:18,844
I watch them from my window.

290
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:25,077
You think I'm a bastard?

291
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:26,379
Yes.

292
00:37:26,418 --> 00:37:28,215
Come look.

293
00:37:31,090 --> 00:37:37,120
He bought a telephone in Japan
that uses another wavelength.

294
00:37:37,163 --> 00:37:40,223
My radio can't pick it up.

295
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:42,734
Too bad.

296
00:37:42,768 --> 00:37:45,896
I think he's responsible
for most of the heroin trade...

297
00:37:45,938 --> 00:37:48,304
in Geneva.

298
00:37:48,340 --> 00:37:50,570
We have nothing on him.

299
00:37:50,609 --> 00:37:52,907
He never takes risks.

300
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:01,843
- Do you like him?
- Very much.

301
00:38:04,623 --> 00:38:06,352
I'll call him.

302
00:38:07,426 --> 00:38:09,519
You have his phone number?

303
00:38:35,154 --> 00:38:37,247
- Hello?
- You deserve to die.

304
00:38:55,608 --> 00:38:57,269
What did I do?

305
00:38:58,344 --> 00:39:00,812
Here's his phone number.

306
00:39:00,846 --> 00:39:03,371
If you feel like saying
mean things to him...

307
00:39:03,415 --> 00:39:05,076
don't hesitate.

308
00:39:15,828 --> 00:39:19,924
At 10:00, I turned off
the lights. I couldn't sleep.

309
00:39:19,965 --> 00:39:22,195
Next program.
Not very interesting.

310
00:39:22,234 --> 00:39:26,295
I kept tossing and turning.
It kept hurting.

311
00:39:26,338 --> 00:39:27,703
It still does.

312
00:39:29,308 --> 00:39:32,141
I haven't done the errands.

313
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:35,613
- I'm sorry, Mother.
- I have no milk or bread.

314
00:39:35,648 --> 00:39:39,778
I bought you some.
I put it in the freezer.

315
00:39:39,818 --> 00:39:41,217
I ate it all.

316
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:45,417
You didn't eat seven loaves
in four days. I'm sick of this.

317
00:39:47,826 --> 00:39:50,556
Go do her errands.

318
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:53,494
Maybe you'd feel better.

319
00:40:00,039 --> 00:40:03,167
Maybe she's the one
who'd feel better.

320
00:40:03,208 --> 00:40:06,336
Why did you pick up Rita?

321
00:40:07,346 --> 00:40:09,371
Because I'd run over her.

322
00:40:09,415 --> 00:40:11,975
She was bleeding.

323
00:40:12,017 --> 00:40:14,451
Otherwise,
you'd have felt guilty.

324
00:40:14,486 --> 00:40:19,924
You'd have dreamt of a dog
with a crushed skull.

325
00:40:19,959 --> 00:40:21,551
Yes.

326
00:40:21,593 --> 00:40:24,619
So who did you do it for?

327
00:40:29,535 --> 00:40:32,504
Don't bother doing
that lady's errands.

328
00:40:32,538 --> 00:40:34,699
She has everything she needs.

329
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,267
She wants to see her daughter.

330
00:40:38,310 --> 00:40:42,542
She already came 5 times, when
her mother faked a heart attack.

331
00:40:45,451 --> 00:40:49,353
After she dies,
I'll have to call the daughter.

332
00:40:51,056 --> 00:40:53,081
She doesn't believe her anymore.

333
00:40:57,129 --> 00:40:59,654
You're mistaken.

334
00:40:59,698 --> 00:41:01,859
About what?

335
00:41:01,900 --> 00:41:03,390
About everything.

336
00:41:05,404 --> 00:41:07,099
Everything.

337
00:41:12,344 --> 00:41:14,073
People aren't bad.

338
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:15,137
It's not true.

339
00:41:17,149 --> 00:41:18,275
Yes.

340
00:41:18,317 --> 00:41:20,877
They may be weak sometimes.

341
00:41:20,919 --> 00:41:25,288
The boy who learned
his father wasn't his father...

342
00:41:25,324 --> 00:41:26,848
your boyfriend or your brother?

343
00:41:29,595 --> 00:41:30,994
My brother.

344
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:33,794
How old is he?

345
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,126
Sixteen.

346
00:41:36,168 --> 00:41:38,329
How long
has he been shooting up?

347
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:42,901
How do you know?

348
00:41:42,941 --> 00:41:45,409
It wasn't hard to guess.

349
00:41:51,417 --> 00:41:53,908
I can only feel pity for you.

350
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,259
Maybe you don't know.

351
00:42:04,296 --> 00:42:05,820
Your dog is pregnant.

352
00:44:26,905 --> 00:44:29,305
- It's Valentine.
- Hello, darling.

353
00:44:29,341 --> 00:44:31,070
Mom, did Marc come?

354
00:44:31,109 --> 00:44:34,567
2 days ago. With his girlfriend.
Do you know her?

355
00:44:34,613 --> 00:44:35,841
Yes. Marie.

356
00:44:35,881 --> 00:44:39,339
We're all together.
They're watching TV.

357
00:44:39,384 --> 00:44:43,252
- I'm sorry I can't be there.
- Too bad. It's like old times.

358
00:44:43,288 --> 00:44:45,085
Your brother's a good boy.

359
00:44:45,123 --> 00:44:46,488
Can I talk to him?

360
00:44:46,525 --> 00:44:48,356
Marc! He's coming.

361
00:44:48,393 --> 00:44:50,361
Call me, Mom. I love you.

362
00:44:50,395 --> 00:44:53,660
- Hi, Valentine.
- Thanks for going there.

363
00:44:53,699 --> 00:44:56,691
We're leaving tomorrow.
I can't stand it.

364
00:44:58,370 --> 00:45:00,133
Mom didn't see the paper?

365
00:45:00,172 --> 00:45:02,766
I don't think so.
She'd never believe it.

366
00:45:04,309 --> 00:45:05,936
You're right.
You should go home.

367
00:45:05,978 --> 00:45:07,309
Bye.

368
00:45:12,551 --> 00:45:14,815
Call me, Michel.

369
00:45:14,853 --> 00:45:17,219
Please call me.

370
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:21,183
Did you see the picture?

371
00:45:21,226 --> 00:45:23,456
The picture?

372
00:45:23,495 --> 00:45:24,792
Is that you, Jacques?

373
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:28,789
Isn't it amazing?
You didn't see it?

374
00:45:28,834 --> 00:45:30,563
I forgot. I've had a hard day.

375
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:34,129
- Come meet us. It'll relax you.
- Where?

376
00:45:39,378 --> 00:45:41,676
Not bad!

377
00:49:07,285 --> 00:49:09,719
I'm sorry to bother you.

378
00:49:09,754 --> 00:49:12,314
Someone played a stupid prank.
I can't get in.

379
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:19,019
Those kids...
Turks. Always trouble.

380
00:49:19,064 --> 00:49:20,224
I don't know.

381
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:23,166
They stuck chewing gum
in my lock.

382
00:49:23,201 --> 00:49:25,192
Tweezers.

383
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:37,812
- It's me.
- Michel.

384
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:40,613
I just called.
There was no answer.

385
00:49:40,652 --> 00:49:43,985
Someone stuck chewing gum
in my lock.

386
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:45,614
I heard the phone.

387
00:49:45,657 --> 00:49:47,124
Chewing gum?

388
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:52,653
I did an ad for chewing gum.
That must be why.

389
00:49:52,697 --> 00:49:55,666
I told you not to.
They take advantage of you.

390
00:49:55,700 --> 00:49:57,497
Michel...

391
00:49:57,536 --> 00:49:59,504
Forget it.

392
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,597
There was no answering machine.

393
00:50:05,377 --> 00:50:07,277
All I want is peace.

394
00:50:08,547 --> 00:50:10,515
A life of peace and quiet.

395
00:50:10,549 --> 00:50:13,279
Life won't be peaceful with me.

396
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,787
Did you meet someone?

397
00:50:17,822 --> 00:50:20,484
No. I'm waiting for you.

398
00:50:20,525 --> 00:50:23,494
Why didn't you answer before?

399
00:50:23,528 --> 00:50:26,429
I told you.
I couldn't get inside.

400
00:50:26,464 --> 00:50:28,398
I understand.

401
00:50:30,435 --> 00:50:32,027
How are you?

402
00:50:32,070 --> 00:50:34,300
I'm going to Hungary next week.

403
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:37,169
What are you doing?

404
00:50:37,208 --> 00:50:40,336
- I'm going to bed.
- Go ahead.

405
00:50:40,378 --> 00:50:41,606
Go on!

406
00:50:44,215 --> 00:50:46,979
Are you there?

407
00:50:47,018 --> 00:50:48,178
Michel, are you there?

408
00:50:54,259 --> 00:50:56,193
It's starting again.

409
00:51:19,851 --> 00:51:22,547
- Are you asleep?
- No. I'm not.

410
00:51:22,587 --> 00:51:24,555
Get into bed.

411
00:51:26,057 --> 00:51:27,752
Are you in bed?

412
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:30,124
I'm taking a shower.
I was getting undressed.

413
00:51:30,161 --> 00:51:32,129
No one is helping you?

414
00:51:36,001 --> 00:51:38,526
Valentine, are you there?

415
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,401
No. Good night.

416
00:51:54,586 --> 00:51:56,713
I knew you'd make it.

417
00:51:58,256 --> 00:51:59,814
Did they ask the question?

418
00:51:59,858 --> 00:52:03,658
From the book
you dropped in the street.

419
00:52:35,560 --> 00:52:37,460
You don't like it?

420
00:52:37,495 --> 00:52:39,793
Yes. Very much.

421
00:52:41,132 --> 00:52:44,363
What will be
the first judgment I sign?

422
00:53:11,896 --> 00:53:14,296
Civil hearing.

423
00:53:14,332 --> 00:53:18,200
The inhabitants of Pinchat
against Joseph Kern.

424
00:53:18,236 --> 00:53:19,931
Please enter.

425
00:54:23,034 --> 00:54:27,403
I'd like number 432.
Van den Budenmayer.

426
00:54:27,438 --> 00:54:29,872
- Did I pronounce it right?
- Yes.

427
00:54:31,442 --> 00:54:32,966
This one?

428
00:54:34,679 --> 00:54:37,648
I just sold the last one.

429
00:54:39,317 --> 00:54:40,944
I'll have others
this afternoon.

430
00:54:40,985 --> 00:54:42,885
I can set one aside.

431
00:54:53,998 --> 00:54:55,795
Whose paper is this?

432
00:54:55,834 --> 00:54:57,461
Yours.

433
00:55:30,735 --> 00:55:31,895
I came...

434
00:55:33,504 --> 00:55:35,529
I saw the newspaper.

435
00:55:35,573 --> 00:55:37,700
I want you to know
I didn't tell a soul.

436
00:55:37,742 --> 00:55:39,232
I know.

437
00:55:39,277 --> 00:55:43,111
No one.
Not the police. No one.

438
00:55:43,147 --> 00:55:44,614
I know.

439
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:50,583
I know who it was.

440
00:55:50,622 --> 00:55:53,216
Who?

441
00:55:53,258 --> 00:55:54,520
It was me.

442
00:55:56,494 --> 00:55:59,156
You asked me to.

443
00:55:59,197 --> 00:56:00,528
Won't you come in?

444
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:04,733
Let me show you something.

445
00:56:22,887 --> 00:56:28,257
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

446
00:56:28,293 --> 00:56:29,419
Seven?

447
00:56:29,460 --> 00:56:31,223
Seven.

448
00:56:33,197 --> 00:56:36,325
Won't you have
some pear brandy?

449
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:47,006
I've had it for ages,
but I've never had an occasion.

450
00:57:03,127 --> 00:57:05,118
To my health.

451
00:57:10,735 --> 00:57:13,363
Why did you do it?

452
00:57:13,404 --> 00:57:15,634
Why did I turn myself in?

453
00:57:15,673 --> 00:57:17,231
Yes.

454
00:57:19,177 --> 00:57:22,669
To see what you'd do
once you saw it in your paper.

455
00:57:24,215 --> 00:57:26,206
You thought I would come?

456
00:57:26,250 --> 00:57:29,344
After our last conversation,
I thought so.

457
00:57:30,488 --> 00:57:31,750
Why?

458
00:57:40,431 --> 00:57:42,399
Do you expect something
from me?

459
00:57:42,433 --> 00:57:43,832
Yes.

460
00:57:46,371 --> 00:57:50,000
Before you left,
you mentioned pity.

461
00:57:51,542 --> 00:57:54,477
Afterwards,
I realized it was disgust.

462
00:58:05,890 --> 00:58:07,949
Will you sit down a moment?

463
00:58:17,035 --> 00:58:18,696
Will you smile for me?

464
00:58:25,877 --> 00:58:29,574
The day you left, you cried.

465
00:58:29,614 --> 00:58:31,844
I cried.

466
00:58:34,352 --> 00:58:37,185
And I shut off my radio.

467
00:58:38,523 --> 00:58:41,458
I sat down at my desk.

468
00:58:41,492 --> 00:58:45,519
The fountain pen I'd used
all my life was out of ink...

469
00:58:45,563 --> 00:58:47,724
so I took a pencil...

470
00:58:47,765 --> 00:58:49,960
and wrote letters
to my neighbors...

471
00:58:50,001 --> 00:58:52,299
and to the police.

472
00:58:52,336 --> 00:58:54,566
I mailed them that evening.

473
00:58:54,605 --> 00:58:57,438
While you were
sleeping soundly.

474
00:58:57,475 --> 00:58:59,409
I wasn't sleeping.

475
00:59:00,845 --> 00:59:02,938
- I had gone bowling.
- Bowling?

476
00:59:04,515 --> 00:59:07,848
Do you remember
that couple's conversation?

477
00:59:07,885 --> 00:59:09,853
The boy and the girl?

478
00:59:11,389 --> 00:59:13,254
I remember.

479
00:59:13,291 --> 00:59:15,259
They wanted to go, too.

480
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:17,261
That same evening.

481
00:59:17,295 --> 00:59:20,287
Maybe you were
right next to them.

482
00:59:22,600 --> 00:59:24,625
Maybe.

483
00:59:27,338 --> 00:59:29,306
You didn't like her.

484
00:59:31,676 --> 00:59:34,144
It's almost over. I was right.

485
00:59:37,548 --> 00:59:39,539
You seem happy about it.

486
00:59:46,324 --> 00:59:48,224
Did you provoke it?

487
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:59,126
Yes or no?

488
01:00:01,272 --> 01:00:04,764
Because of my eavesdropping
and my trial...

489
01:00:04,809 --> 01:00:07,243
the girl met another man.

490
01:00:39,577 --> 01:00:41,204
Good day.

491
01:00:44,549 --> 01:00:47,279
Since then, she's been alone.

492
01:00:47,318 --> 01:00:50,185
I asked my brother
to go see her.

493
01:00:50,221 --> 01:00:52,587
He stayed three days.

494
01:00:56,260 --> 01:01:00,026
In one week
I'm going to England.

495
01:01:00,064 --> 01:01:02,089
I'm abandoning
my mother and my brother.

496
01:01:02,133 --> 01:01:05,125
Every day
he gets a little worse.

497
01:01:05,169 --> 01:01:07,069
I shouldn't leave.

498
01:01:07,104 --> 01:01:10,267
Leave. It's your destiny.

499
01:01:10,308 --> 01:01:13,835
You can't live
your brother's life for him.

500
01:01:19,717 --> 01:01:21,082
I love him.

501
01:01:23,454 --> 01:01:25,786
If only I could help.

502
01:01:25,823 --> 01:01:28,553
You can. Be.

503
01:01:29,794 --> 01:01:32,262
What do you mean?

504
01:01:32,296 --> 01:01:35,129
That's all: be.

505
01:01:39,470 --> 01:01:41,961
Do you like flying?

506
01:01:42,006 --> 01:01:43,803
Then take the ferry.

507
01:01:45,309 --> 01:01:47,277
I've never taken one.

508
01:01:47,311 --> 01:01:50,041
It's less expensive
and healthier.

509
01:01:50,081 --> 01:01:52,311
That's a good idea.

510
01:02:01,158 --> 01:02:02,750
Do you like it?

511
01:02:03,928 --> 01:02:06,158
Today is my birthday.

512
01:02:06,197 --> 01:02:07,664
I didn't know.

513
01:02:10,601 --> 01:02:15,732
35 years ago today,
at about the same time, 5:00...

514
01:02:15,773 --> 01:02:18,367
I acquitted a man. A sailor.

515
01:02:20,077 --> 01:02:24,480
One of my first big cases.
It was a tough time in my life.

516
01:02:26,584 --> 01:02:30,213
I have since realized
I made a mistake.

517
01:02:31,689 --> 01:02:33,589
He was guilty.

518
01:02:38,462 --> 01:02:40,453
I'm all out of bulbs.

519
01:03:09,260 --> 01:03:12,058
What happened to him?

520
01:03:12,096 --> 01:03:14,621
I did my own investigation.

521
01:03:14,665 --> 01:03:18,192
He's married
with three children.

522
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:20,635
A grandson.

523
01:03:21,772 --> 01:03:23,672
He is living in peace.

524
01:03:24,975 --> 01:03:28,342
So what you did was necessary.

525
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:33,750
And you did it well.

526
01:03:39,623 --> 01:03:41,648
Don't you understand?

527
01:03:43,594 --> 01:03:45,289
You saved him.

528
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:48,728
Perhaps.

529
01:03:48,766 --> 01:03:51,599
But how many others
could I have acquitted?

530
01:03:51,635 --> 01:03:53,262
Even guilty?

531
01:03:54,538 --> 01:04:00,170
Deciding what is true and
what isn't now seems to me...

532
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:02,441
a lack of modesty.

533
01:04:04,315 --> 01:04:05,646
Vanity?

534
01:04:07,184 --> 01:04:08,674
Vanity.

535
01:04:18,429 --> 01:04:20,420
Can I have a drop?

536
01:04:30,741 --> 01:04:32,231
To you!

537
01:04:36,414 --> 01:04:38,712
If I had to go to court...

538
01:04:39,884 --> 01:04:42,580
are there still
judges like you?

539
01:04:43,788 --> 01:04:46,348
You won't go to court.

540
01:04:46,390 --> 01:04:48,881
Justice doesn't deal
with the innocent.

541
01:04:52,496 --> 01:04:54,259
See that?

542
01:04:54,298 --> 01:04:56,926
It's the sixth window
they've broken.

543
01:04:56,967 --> 01:04:58,935
The wavelength
has been changed.

544
01:04:58,969 --> 01:05:01,403
I can no longer eavesdrop.

545
01:05:03,407 --> 01:05:05,102
Where is the broom?

546
01:05:05,142 --> 01:05:07,440
In the kitchen closet.

547
01:05:28,899 --> 01:05:31,367
Put the stone on the piano.

548
01:05:49,854 --> 01:05:51,685
You're not afraid?

549
01:05:54,158 --> 01:05:57,184
I wonder what I'd do
in their place.

550
01:05:58,929 --> 01:06:00,590
The same thing.

551
01:06:01,832 --> 01:06:03,823
You'd throw stones?

552
01:06:03,868 --> 01:06:06,928
In their place? Of course.

553
01:06:06,971 --> 01:06:10,668
And that goes
for everyone I judged.

554
01:06:10,708 --> 01:06:12,608
Given their lives...

555
01:06:12,643 --> 01:06:15,544
I would steal,
I'd kill, I'd lie.

556
01:06:15,579 --> 01:06:17,012
Of course I would.

557
01:06:20,351 --> 01:06:24,253
All that because I wasn't
in their shoes, but mine.

558
01:06:29,593 --> 01:06:31,720
Is there someone you love?

559
01:06:34,331 --> 01:06:35,593
No.

560
01:06:38,269 --> 01:06:40,294
Have you ever loved?

561
01:06:47,678 --> 01:06:49,270
Yesterday I dreamt...

562
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:54,082
I dreamt of you.

563
01:06:57,454 --> 01:07:00,150
You were
forty or fifty years old...

564
01:07:01,926 --> 01:07:03,894
and you were happy.

565
01:07:05,629 --> 01:07:08,097
Do your dreams come true?

566
01:07:10,968 --> 01:07:14,734
It's been years
since I dreamt something nice.

567
01:08:02,620 --> 01:08:04,110
Stay there!

568
01:10:52,556 --> 01:10:55,081
I bought a ticket
for the ferry.

569
01:10:55,125 --> 01:10:58,959
I arrive in England
next Wednesday.

570
01:11:02,432 --> 01:11:04,491
At 7:30 a.m.

571
01:11:04,535 --> 01:11:06,127
Why the ferry?

572
01:11:07,204 --> 01:11:10,765
So I can visit my mother
near Calais.

573
01:11:10,808 --> 01:11:14,801
I'll meet you at 8:00.

574
01:11:14,845 --> 01:11:16,813
I'm happy you're coming.

575
01:11:18,182 --> 01:11:20,616
Michel, tell me...

576
01:11:20,651 --> 01:11:21,982
do you love me?

577
01:11:22,019 --> 01:11:25,011
I think so.

578
01:11:25,055 --> 01:11:28,616
- You love me, or you think so?
- It's the same thing.

579
01:12:55,412 --> 01:12:57,175
The battery.

580
01:13:59,543 --> 01:14:01,170
Auguste!

581
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:38,277
Personal weather reports.

582
01:14:38,315 --> 01:14:40,977
I've tried calling
for a few days.

583
01:14:41,018 --> 01:14:42,952
I was sick. I'm sorry.

584
01:14:42,986 --> 01:14:46,353
What will the weather be on
the English Channel next week?

585
01:14:46,390 --> 01:14:47,687
Wonderful.

586
01:14:47,724 --> 01:14:50,124
Sunny, a slight breeze,
chilly in the morning.

587
01:14:50,160 --> 01:14:51,684
Why are you laughing?

588
01:14:51,728 --> 01:14:55,027
I intend to go there.
Even farther.

589
01:14:55,065 --> 01:14:56,362
For your work?

590
01:14:56,400 --> 01:14:59,198
No, for pleasure. On a yacht.

591
01:14:59,236 --> 01:15:02,069
- It's a nice sail.
- Yes, very.

592
01:15:02,105 --> 01:15:05,097
- You'll be closing?
- I'll have to.

593
01:15:05,142 --> 01:15:07,906
That's too bad.
It was a good idea. Good-bye.

594
01:15:45,682 --> 01:15:45,949
We told you not to smile!

595
01:15:45,949 --> 01:15:48,383
We told you not to smile!

596
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:50,852
Be serious!

597
01:15:51,922 --> 01:15:55,585
Can you send an invitation
to this address?

598
01:15:55,625 --> 01:15:57,786
Just one person?

599
01:18:47,998 --> 01:18:49,659
Are you OK?

600
01:18:50,667 --> 01:18:52,794
- So long.
- Have a good time.

601
01:19:00,577 --> 01:19:03,171
- There's no makeup remover?
- Here.

602
01:19:15,959 --> 01:19:18,826
Everyone noticed that guy.

603
01:19:18,862 --> 01:19:22,764
During the entire show
I kept staring at him.

604
01:19:47,757 --> 01:19:49,281
You came.

605
01:19:50,460 --> 01:19:52,621
You knew the invitation
came from me?

606
01:19:52,662 --> 01:19:54,892
I'd hoped so.

607
01:19:54,931 --> 01:19:57,263
Did you look for me?

608
01:19:57,300 --> 01:19:59,427
During the entire show.

609
01:20:02,439 --> 01:20:05,169
I'm leaving tomorrow.
I wanted to say good-bye.

610
01:20:06,276 --> 01:20:08,403
Good-bye.

611
01:20:10,180 --> 01:20:13,206
I'd like you
to tell me in detail...

612
01:20:13,249 --> 01:20:15,410
the dream you had.

613
01:20:17,153 --> 01:20:20,088
You were fifty years old...

614
01:20:20,123 --> 01:20:21,954
and you were happy.

615
01:20:23,226 --> 01:20:24,818
In this dream...

616
01:20:26,463 --> 01:20:28,522
was there someone else?

617
01:20:29,632 --> 01:20:31,031
There was.

618
01:20:32,569 --> 01:20:34,298
Who?

619
01:20:38,141 --> 01:20:40,507
You woke up...

620
01:20:40,543 --> 01:20:44,070
and you smiled
at someone next to you.

621
01:20:44,114 --> 01:20:45,672
I don't know who.

622
01:20:47,217 --> 01:20:49,048
That's what will happen?

623
01:20:50,053 --> 01:20:52,886
In twenty-five or thirty years?

624
01:20:52,922 --> 01:20:54,321
Yes.

625
01:20:59,562 --> 01:21:01,496
What else do you know?

626
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:04,598
Who are you?

627
01:21:06,136 --> 01:21:07,933
A retired judge.

628
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:13,033
I feel something important
is happening around me.

629
01:21:14,644 --> 01:21:16,373
And it scares me.

630
01:21:26,489 --> 01:21:28,889
Is that better?

631
01:21:32,128 --> 01:21:34,255
I used to come here often.

632
01:21:36,032 --> 01:21:37,932
Where did you usually sit?

633
01:21:39,035 --> 01:21:40,593
Where I sat today.

634
01:21:42,005 --> 01:21:44,405
That's why you couldn't see me.

635
01:21:50,146 --> 01:21:53,172
One day,
during the intermission...

636
01:21:53,216 --> 01:21:55,741
the elastic
holding my books broke.

637
01:21:57,287 --> 01:22:00,848
One of them, a big one,
fell down...

638
01:22:01,891 --> 01:22:04,223
somewhere around here.

639
01:22:05,528 --> 01:22:09,555
It was just before my exams.
I ran down immediately.

640
01:22:09,599 --> 01:22:11,863
The book had opened
to a certain page.

641
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:13,869
I read a few sentences.

642
01:22:13,903 --> 01:22:17,805
It was the question they asked
during the exam.

643
01:22:17,841 --> 01:22:21,299
Getting out of the house
did you good.

644
01:22:21,344 --> 01:22:24,177
I had to recharge the battery.

645
01:22:24,214 --> 01:22:25,806
It was dead.

646
01:22:28,618 --> 01:22:30,051
The storm.

647
01:22:59,983 --> 01:23:01,610
Lousy coffee.

648
01:23:03,786 --> 01:23:06,050
I was wondering...

649
01:23:06,089 --> 01:23:08,250
why you mentioned that sailor.

650
01:23:09,259 --> 01:23:11,693
Do you know why?

651
01:23:13,963 --> 01:23:15,225
Yes.

652
01:23:23,172 --> 01:23:25,163
Because...

653
01:23:27,010 --> 01:23:30,446
you didn't want to tell me
something more important.

654
01:23:34,417 --> 01:23:37,511
About the woman that you loved.

655
01:23:41,491 --> 01:23:43,391
She betrayed you.

656
01:23:47,230 --> 01:23:48,891
She betrayed you.

657
01:23:50,166 --> 01:23:52,726
And you never understood why.

658
01:23:55,805 --> 01:23:58,501
And you kept on loving her.

659
01:24:00,944 --> 01:24:03,777
How do you know all this?

660
01:24:08,251 --> 01:24:11,584
It wasn't hard to guess.

661
01:24:13,256 --> 01:24:15,156
What was she like?

662
01:24:17,026 --> 01:24:19,620
She graduated
two years before me.

663
01:24:23,399 --> 01:24:26,391
She was blond...

664
01:24:26,436 --> 01:24:28,267
delicate...

665
01:24:29,539 --> 01:24:30,972
radiant...

666
01:24:31,007 --> 01:24:32,907
with a long neck.

667
01:24:35,445 --> 01:24:39,347
Her clothing and her furniture
were all light-colored.

668
01:24:39,382 --> 01:24:44,410
In the foyer there was a mirror
in a white frame.

669
01:24:46,255 --> 01:24:48,689
It was in that mirror...

670
01:24:48,725 --> 01:24:51,023
one night...

671
01:24:51,060 --> 01:24:54,461
that I saw
her white legs spread...

672
01:24:56,065 --> 01:24:58,465
with a man between them.

673
01:25:02,772 --> 01:25:04,637
Why...

674
01:25:04,674 --> 01:25:07,268
did that happen?

675
01:25:07,310 --> 01:25:09,244
Do you know?

676
01:25:09,278 --> 01:25:13,647
This man, whose name
was Hugo Holbling...

677
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,784
could offer her
what she wanted.

678
01:25:22,125 --> 01:25:24,719
They left.

679
01:25:26,062 --> 01:25:28,053
I followed them.

680
01:25:29,432 --> 01:25:32,333
I crossed France,
the Channel...

681
01:25:34,303 --> 01:25:36,396
I was...

682
01:25:36,439 --> 01:25:38,566
humiliated.

683
01:25:40,410 --> 01:25:43,709
Until the day she died
in an accident.

684
01:25:46,049 --> 01:25:49,348
Since then,
I've never loved another woman.

685
01:25:50,553 --> 01:25:51,918
Yes.

686
01:25:51,954 --> 01:25:54,252
I stopped believing.

687
01:25:56,159 --> 01:25:58,684
Maybe I met the woman.

688
01:26:02,432 --> 01:26:05,765
Maybe you're the woman
I never met.

689
01:26:07,537 --> 01:26:09,801
The story doesn't end there.

690
01:26:09,839 --> 01:26:11,170
No.

691
01:26:12,875 --> 01:26:14,968
A while ago...

692
01:26:15,011 --> 01:26:17,571
I was given a difficult case.

693
01:26:17,613 --> 01:26:21,413
On it was written
the name of the defendant...

694
01:26:21,451 --> 01:26:23,009
Hugo Holbling.

695
01:26:23,052 --> 01:26:24,917
The same man.

696
01:26:24,954 --> 01:26:27,252
He'd come back here.

697
01:26:33,062 --> 01:26:34,962
I'm closing up.

698
01:26:37,066 --> 01:26:39,466
Did you see a woman
with a bucket?

699
01:26:41,704 --> 01:26:43,171
No.

700
01:26:43,206 --> 01:26:45,674
The storm flooded the wardrobe.

701
01:26:45,708 --> 01:26:48,643
If you see her,
tell her I'm upstairs.

702
01:26:54,984 --> 01:26:57,475
You shouldn't
have taken the case.

703
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,181
I didn't want to.

704
01:27:03,659 --> 01:27:05,786
At first I wanted to kill him.

705
01:27:07,730 --> 01:27:11,325
I would have, if it would have
changed something.

706
01:27:13,803 --> 01:27:15,862
Now...

707
01:27:15,905 --> 01:27:18,100
he was waiting for my verdict.

708
01:27:20,510 --> 01:27:23,673
He was building a covered
market which caved in.

709
01:27:23,713 --> 01:27:26,011
Several people died.

710
01:27:27,717 --> 01:27:30,584
I said he was guilty.

711
01:27:31,788 --> 01:27:33,688
It was a legal sentence.

712
01:27:38,227 --> 01:27:41,526
Afterwards,
I asked for early retirement.

713
01:27:45,301 --> 01:27:46,859
Did you see her?

714
01:27:49,739 --> 01:27:51,866
I'm always running after her!

715
01:27:54,677 --> 01:27:56,110
Milana!

716
01:28:04,787 --> 01:28:06,118
There you are!

717
01:28:06,155 --> 01:28:08,885
Give me the buckets.
They're heavy.

718
01:28:16,799 --> 01:28:19,131
You seemed to like
my pear brandy.

719
01:28:19,168 --> 01:28:22,865
I have another favor
to ask you.

720
01:28:22,905 --> 01:28:25,499
I'll be gone
two or three weeks.

721
01:28:25,541 --> 01:28:27,509
I'll come see you afterwards.

722
01:28:29,078 --> 01:28:31,979
Please give me
one of the puppies.

723
01:28:34,650 --> 01:28:37,551
Will the fashion show
be on TV?

724
01:28:37,587 --> 01:28:39,384
Probably.

725
01:28:39,422 --> 01:28:41,890
I better buy a TV.

726
01:28:41,924 --> 01:28:44,859
I have one I never use.

727
01:28:44,894 --> 01:28:47,385
My brother can bring it to you.
His name is Marc.

728
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:51,560
I'd like to meet him.
I'll see you soon.

729
01:28:51,601 --> 01:28:53,262
Good-bye.

730
01:28:57,540 --> 01:28:59,599
Do you have your ticket?

731
01:30:27,096 --> 01:30:28,791
