1
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,241
A very long time ago...

2
00:00:25,670 --> 00:00:30,793
... there lived a beautiful princess,
in a mystical land known as...

3
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:32,711
...lndia.

4
00:00:49,064 --> 00:00:52,600
She was married to the
handsome Prince Rama...

5
00:00:52,861 --> 00:00:56,146
... who had been banished
to the enchanted forest...

6
00:00:56,406 --> 00:01:00,354
...by his jealous stepmother,
Queen Kaikeyi.

7
00:01:09,251 --> 00:01:10,282
One day...

8
00:01:10,544 --> 00:01:13,746
...Princess Sita saw a wounded deer
in the woods...

9
00:01:14,005 --> 00:01:17,040
...and she begged Rama
to go and help it.

10
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:22,424
Rama drew a circle in the ground
and said to her:

11
00:01:22,847 --> 00:01:24,804
''This is a magic circle.

12
00:01:25,056 --> 00:01:27,630
So long as you stay inside it...

13
00:01:27,892 --> 00:01:30,181
...no harm can come to you. ''

14
00:01:34,523 --> 00:01:37,560
That night,
the princess heard a horrible cry.

15
00:01:37,818 --> 00:01:39,977
Help me.

16
00:01:40,529 --> 00:01:43,316
Thinking it was her beloved Rama
in danger...

17
00:01:43,573 --> 00:01:47,357
... the princess ran from the circle
to answer the cry.

18
00:01:55,876 --> 00:01:59,458
She soon came across
an old beggar man.

19
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:02,917
Although she had no money
to give him...

20
00:02:03,174 --> 00:02:05,796
...she could not refuse his plea.

21
00:02:06,636 --> 00:02:09,306
As soon as he had the bracelet...

22
00:02:10,432 --> 00:02:13,846
. . .he transformed into the
1 0-headed demon, Ravana.

23
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:16,771
He grabs her and takes her
to his palace. . .

24
00:02:17,021 --> 00:02:19,096
. . .to make her his bride.

25
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:23,354
Did you ever know
a real prince, Maya?

26
00:02:24,569 --> 00:02:25,897
Laki's father.

27
00:02:26,195 --> 00:02:29,150
-l thought he was in the army.
-He was.

28
00:02:29,408 --> 00:02:31,612
And he was my prince.

29
00:02:31,867 --> 00:02:34,193
And l, his princess.

30
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:37,034
But l mean real princes
and princesses.

31
00:02:37,373 --> 00:02:39,615
All women are princesses.

32
00:02:39,875 --> 00:02:41,285
lt is our right.

33
00:03:23,289 --> 00:03:24,913
l shall miss it here.

34
00:03:25,332 --> 00:03:29,330
lndia is the only place on earth
that stirs the imagination.

35
00:03:30,087 --> 00:03:32,756
l wish we could stay here forever.

36
00:03:35,885 --> 00:03:39,797
l know, sweetheart.
But now that England's at war. . .

37
00:03:41,515 --> 00:03:44,799
. . .l must go too.
You understand, don't you?

38
00:03:45,227 --> 00:03:47,385
But why must l go to America?

39
00:03:47,645 --> 00:03:49,103
Because it's safer.

40
00:03:49,354 --> 00:03:53,897
And you'll be going to the school
your mother went to at your age. . .

41
00:03:54,192 --> 00:03:56,684
-. . .in a city called?
-New York.

42
00:04:02,367 --> 00:04:03,611
Papa?

43
00:04:03,993 --> 00:04:07,325
Maya told me that all girls
are princesses.

44
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:10,491
-Maya is a very wise woman.
-Then it's true?

45
00:04:10,916 --> 00:04:14,866
You can be anything you want to be,
as long as you believe.

46
00:04:15,379 --> 00:04:18,379
-What do you believe?
-l believe that you are. . .

47
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:22,499
. . .and always will be,
my little princess.

48
00:05:01,421 --> 00:05:05,369
l gave this to your mother
on our wedding day.

49
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:07,632
l want you to have it.

50
00:05:10,261 --> 00:05:12,339
She was so beautiful.

51
00:05:14,724 --> 00:05:17,048
What did you love most about her?

52
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,061
Tough question.

53
00:05:23,899 --> 00:05:26,983
l loved the way her eyes lit up
when she laughed.

54
00:05:27,236 --> 00:05:28,730
Just like yours do.

55
00:05:29,780 --> 00:05:34,107
l loved the sound of her voice when
she sang me the lndian folksong.

56
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,948
But l think,
more than anything else. . .

57
00:05:39,289 --> 00:05:41,695
. . .l loved dancing with her!

58
00:06:55,275 --> 00:06:56,519
Hello!

59
00:06:57,318 --> 00:06:59,060
You must be Captain Crewe.

60
00:07:02,864 --> 00:07:04,738
My sister will be down presently.

61
00:07:05,117 --> 00:07:07,654
We were just preparing
the young lady's room.

62
00:07:07,911 --> 00:07:09,819
Your things arrived this morning.

63
00:07:10,037 --> 00:07:10,950
Thank you. . .?

64
00:07:11,872 --> 00:07:14,363
Heavens, Amelia.
Amelia Minchin.

65
00:07:15,877 --> 00:07:17,204
Captain Crewe.

66
00:07:30,514 --> 00:07:32,424
How delightful to meet you!

67
00:07:34,269 --> 00:07:36,474
And this must be little Sara.

68
00:07:37,103 --> 00:07:39,262
My, what a beautiful child.

69
00:07:39,523 --> 00:07:43,355
-l was telling the Captain--
-Thank you, that'll be all.

70
00:07:43,611 --> 00:07:44,725
Won't you follow me?

71
00:07:47,279 --> 00:07:49,606
Classes begin promptly at 8:00.

72
00:07:49,866 --> 00:07:52,783
We cover all subjects:
literature, math, science. . .

73
00:07:53,035 --> 00:07:55,240
. . .and of course, French and Latin.

74
00:07:55,495 --> 00:07:57,323
Oh, Sara speaks fluent--

75
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:00,575
Luncheon is served at 1 :30.
Then we take our daily walk. . .

76
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,038
. . .unless the weather is
extremely inclement.

77
00:08:04,296 --> 00:08:07,046
At 4:00, the girls attend
etiquette classes. . .

78
00:08:07,256 --> 00:08:11,039
. . .where they're trained in
the formal graces of society.

79
00:08:12,053 --> 00:08:16,631
Study hall is between 4:30 and 6:30,
followed by a light supper.

80
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:19,975
Before bedtime,
we read from one of the classics. . .

81
00:08:20,227 --> 00:08:23,392
. . .something the children
look forward to with anticipation.

82
00:08:23,645 --> 00:08:27,062
Sunday is a day of rest.
Students may write to their parents.

83
00:08:27,317 --> 00:08:30,899
And of course, we attend church.
Have you any questions?

84
00:08:42,704 --> 00:08:44,283
Come along, dear.

85
00:09:00,013 --> 00:09:01,009
Girls.

86
00:09:01,264 --> 00:09:03,837
Say hello
to our new arrival. . .

87
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,380
. . .Miss Sara Crewe.

88
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:07,516
Hello, Sara.

89
00:09:07,977 --> 00:09:11,263
You must tell them about
your exciting life in lndia.

90
00:09:11,523 --> 00:09:15,355
No doubt she'll be our most
popular student in no time.

91
00:09:15,569 --> 00:09:19,186
There are certain rules
that should be made clear.

92
00:09:19,447 --> 00:09:21,190
First is the Order Rule. . .

93
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:25,067
. . .which requires the girls keep
their rooms spotless.

94
00:09:52,561 --> 00:09:55,181
These rules are strictly enforced.

95
00:09:55,438 --> 00:09:59,222
But l assure you, the results
are well worth the effort.

96
00:09:59,859 --> 00:10:02,527
Our reputation for sending
the most poised. . .

97
00:10:02,777 --> 00:10:05,696
. . .and charming young ladies
into society. . .

98
00:10:06,407 --> 00:10:07,949
. . .is one of the highest.

99
00:10:08,157 --> 00:10:09,403
l've no doubt.

100
00:10:10,786 --> 00:10:15,827
Also, l'm afraid jewelry
and such finery are not allowed.

101
00:10:16,333 --> 00:10:19,036
What if l wear it in my room,
during my free time?

102
00:10:20,711 --> 00:10:23,036
lf you absolutely insist.

103
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:26,838
l do.

104
00:10:28,844 --> 00:10:30,385
She'll get in trouble.

105
00:10:46,651 --> 00:10:48,228
This is splendid.

106
00:10:48,987 --> 00:10:50,185
lt's our largest suite.

107
00:10:51,615 --> 00:10:54,320
Thank you for all the care
you've taken.

108
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:57,286
l want Sara to feel at home
while l'm away.

109
00:10:58,162 --> 00:11:01,696
-No expense shall be spared.
-Of course not.

110
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:03,701
l'll let you say goodbye.

111
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:07,125
You don't have much time
before your boat leaves.

112
00:11:21,768 --> 00:11:24,518
We'll write to each other
every day.

113
00:11:32,027 --> 00:11:33,769
How do you like your room?

114
00:11:34,028 --> 00:11:39,152
l made sure it was the best,
with corner windows and a fireplace.

115
00:11:39,783 --> 00:11:43,116
And with all your toys
and clothes moved in. . .

116
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:45,659
. . .it's as if you were really. . . .

117
00:11:48,917 --> 00:11:50,910
l think l saw something. . .

118
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,537
. . .on that chair over there.

119
00:11:57,841 --> 00:12:01,293
She came all the way from France
to be with you.

120
00:12:03,763 --> 00:12:05,223
Her name is Emily.

121
00:12:11,729 --> 00:12:14,480
Dolls make the very
best friends.

122
00:12:15,649 --> 00:12:19,861
Just because they can't speak
doesn't mean they don't listen.

123
00:12:20,404 --> 00:12:24,816
Did you know, when we leave them alone
in our room, they come to life?

124
00:12:25,033 --> 00:12:26,491
-They do?
-Yes.

125
00:12:26,742 --> 00:12:30,029
Before we walk in, they quickly
return to their places.

126
00:12:31,163 --> 00:12:34,366
Why don't they come to life
in front of us?

127
00:12:34,626 --> 00:12:36,499
Because it's magic.

128
00:12:38,170 --> 00:12:40,127
Magic has to be believed.

129
00:12:40,671 --> 00:12:42,997
That's the only way it's real.

130
00:12:45,343 --> 00:12:48,760
Whenever you're afraid,
or miss me terribly. . .

131
00:12:49,014 --> 00:12:50,756
. . .just tell Emily.

132
00:12:52,015 --> 00:12:55,301
She'll get the message to me,
wherever l am.

133
00:12:56,269 --> 00:12:59,223
And l'll send one back right away. . .

134
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:01,598
. . .so when you hug her. . .

135
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:05,524
. . .you'll be getting a hug from me.

136
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:16,409
lt's all right, Papa.

137
00:13:18,373 --> 00:13:20,365
l'm going to be fine.

138
00:13:29,174 --> 00:13:30,717
What are you doing?

139
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,254
Memorizing me by heart?

140
00:13:37,057 --> 00:13:39,678
l already know you by heart.

141
00:14:00,996 --> 00:14:02,655
Goodbye princess.

142
00:14:33,108 --> 00:14:37,853
What was that noise last night?
Somebody was crying for hours.

143
00:14:38,071 --> 00:14:41,606
That's nothing.
You should hear Josephine snore.

144
00:14:42,701 --> 00:14:44,242
l do not!

145
00:14:44,493 --> 00:14:46,532
Who was it? The new girl?

146
00:14:46,745 --> 00:14:51,075
She hasn't come out of her room.
Did you see all her toys?

147
00:14:51,333 --> 00:14:52,911
l want your hair ribbon.

148
00:14:53,126 --> 00:14:56,460
Her father grows crackers.
They're very rich.

149
00:14:56,672 --> 00:14:59,672
They must be.
Everyone l know eats crackers.

150
00:14:59,882 --> 00:15:04,459
Her father's British. l hear he's
best friends with the king and queen.

151
00:15:04,677 --> 00:15:06,802
l hear he was thrown out of lndia. . .

152
00:15:07,014 --> 00:15:11,142
. . .because people died
from eating his poisoned crackers.

153
00:15:11,352 --> 00:15:13,011
Poisoned crackers?

154
00:15:13,228 --> 00:15:16,062
My aunt died from eating poisoned
string beans.

155
00:15:16,272 --> 00:15:20,270
-Who cares about her?
-Yeah, who cares?

156
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:28,485
But before we catch them, they return
to their places, quick as lightning.

157
00:15:29,409 --> 00:15:31,153
Gosh, she's fast.

158
00:15:43,922 --> 00:15:44,836
Mama.

159
00:15:46,925 --> 00:15:48,039
Sara?

160
00:15:48,385 --> 00:15:51,219
We don't delay breakfast
for one student.

161
00:15:51,470 --> 00:15:52,846
l'm sorry, but l--

162
00:15:53,056 --> 00:15:56,342
Remember, you're not the only
child here.

163
00:16:01,396 --> 00:16:03,685
Yes, good morning.

164
00:16:03,899 --> 00:16:07,483
You remember our newest pupil
from our visit yesterday.

165
00:16:07,695 --> 00:16:09,603
This is Monsieur Dufarge.

166
00:16:09,904 --> 00:16:12,110
You begin French lessons today.

167
00:16:12,323 --> 00:16:14,150
Do l have to?

168
00:16:14,492 --> 00:16:16,365
You most certainly do.

169
00:16:16,619 --> 00:16:19,536
Apologize to Monsieur
for your rudeness.

170
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:22,493
-But l didn't mean to be rude.
-Now!

171
00:16:38,848 --> 00:16:43,972
This child doesn't need to learn French.
She practically is French!

172
00:16:44,186 --> 00:16:45,562
She learned from her father.

173
00:16:45,813 --> 00:16:48,018
l understood what she said.

174
00:16:48,230 --> 00:16:50,390
l'm sorry. We tried to tell you.

175
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:53,146
She can tutor the younger children. . .

176
00:16:53,403 --> 00:16:57,814
. . .and help you
with your pronunciation, Miss Minchin.

177
00:16:58,281 --> 00:17:01,448
Are those sausages l smell?

178
00:17:15,840 --> 00:17:17,214
Thank you.

179
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:20,293
There's no talking at the table.

180
00:17:21,262 --> 00:17:22,803
Doesn't seem natural.

181
00:17:25,847 --> 00:17:27,591
l won't say it again.

182
00:17:36,566 --> 00:17:38,476
Seven times five is 35.

183
00:17:39,486 --> 00:17:41,644
Seven times six is 42.

184
00:17:41,904 --> 00:17:43,613
Seven times seven is 49.

185
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:46,523
Seven times eight is. . .

186
00:17:46,826 --> 00:17:48,201
. . .58.

187
00:17:49,370 --> 00:17:51,778
No, wait. 54?

188
00:17:54,374 --> 00:17:55,239
55?

189
00:17:55,499 --> 00:17:58,252
Or 72? Or 93? Or 1 2?

190
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,835
l'm sorry, Miss Minchin.

191
00:18:01,298 --> 00:18:03,789
l studied for hours last night.

192
00:18:04,050 --> 00:18:06,042
l find that hard to believe.

193
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:08,627
l imagine your father will as well.

194
00:18:08,971 --> 00:18:11,048
Please don't tell him.

195
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:13,347
l promise l'll do better.

196
00:18:13,725 --> 00:18:15,267
Please.

197
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,013
Lavinia, you may continue.

198
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,648
Seven times eight is 56.

199
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:22,898
Seven times nine. . .

200
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:25,143
. . .is 63.

201
00:18:34,995 --> 00:18:36,323
Dear Papa:

202
00:18:36,663 --> 00:18:38,287
l miss you already.

203
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:40,281
Things are fine.

204
00:18:40,542 --> 00:18:44,586
Except l never imagined there
would be so many rules at school.

205
00:18:44,837 --> 00:18:47,210
l guess they're there for a purpose...

206
00:18:47,465 --> 00:18:49,671
...and l'm trying hard to obey them.

207
00:18:49,925 --> 00:18:52,925
But l get the feeling
l'm doing something wrong.

208
00:19:10,444 --> 00:19:11,937
Goodbye, Father.

209
00:19:14,031 --> 00:19:15,109
Bye, son.

210
00:19:30,545 --> 00:19:32,004
l hope when you read this...

211
00:19:32,255 --> 00:19:36,122
...it kindles your heart and puts
a smile on your face.

212
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:40,880
l'm so proud of you.
l think about you every moment.

213
00:19:41,139 --> 00:19:43,215
And l love you forever.

214
00:19:43,891 --> 00:19:45,551
Your Sara.

215
00:19:58,321 --> 00:20:00,728
Lottie, you mustn't get so excited.

216
00:20:00,990 --> 00:20:02,567
Lottie? Precious?

217
00:20:02,824 --> 00:20:06,905
Please, Lottie dear!
Please stop screaming!

218
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:11,160
How about a cookie?
Would you like that?

219
00:20:11,792 --> 00:20:13,250
l'll get a cookie.

220
00:20:21,300 --> 00:20:24,752
lt's hard to study with you
carrying on like this.

221
00:20:25,013 --> 00:20:26,127
l want my mama!

222
00:20:26,513 --> 00:20:27,711
You'll see her soon.

223
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:32,639
l won't. She's dead,
and l won't ever see her again!

224
00:20:32,977 --> 00:20:35,137
l don't have a mother either.

225
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,603
You don't?

226
00:20:42,111 --> 00:20:43,356
Where is she?

227
00:20:43,696 --> 00:20:46,482
ln heaven with my baby sister.

228
00:20:47,407 --> 00:20:49,364
That doesn't mean
l can't talk to her.

229
00:20:49,576 --> 00:20:53,195
l tell her everything,
and l know she hears me.

230
00:20:53,456 --> 00:20:54,865
How?

231
00:20:55,831 --> 00:20:57,788
Because that's what angels do.

232
00:20:58,041 --> 00:21:00,959
-Your mama's an angel?
-Of course.

233
00:21:01,253 --> 00:21:05,120
And so is yours.
With beautiful wings of silk. . .

234
00:21:05,424 --> 00:21:07,417
. . .and a crown of rosebuds.

235
00:21:07,759 --> 00:21:10,380
And they all live together
in a castle.

236
00:21:10,595 --> 00:21:12,754
Do you know what it's made of?

237
00:21:13,098 --> 00:21:14,341
Sunflowers. . .

238
00:21:14,598 --> 00:21:19,177
. . .hundreds of them, so bright
they shine like gold.

239
00:21:19,853 --> 00:21:22,475
When the angels
want to go someplace. . .

240
00:21:22,690 --> 00:21:25,262
. . .they just whistle, like this.

241
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:36,237
And a cloud floats to the castle
and picks them up.

242
00:21:36,453 --> 00:21:38,824
As the angels fly through the sky. . .

243
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:42,362
. . .riding the cloud
like a magic carpet. . .

244
00:21:42,790 --> 00:21:45,578
. . .under the moon
and through the stars. . .

245
00:21:49,882 --> 00:21:52,549
. . .until they're hovering
above us. . . .

246
00:21:55,386 --> 00:21:59,134
That's how they can look down
and see if we're all right.

247
00:22:00,975 --> 00:22:03,892
And sometimes they even
send messages to us.

248
00:22:06,897 --> 00:22:11,972
You can't hear them if you're
kicking and screaming as you were.

249
00:22:13,694 --> 00:22:17,941
But they always try again,
in case we've missed it.

250
00:22:21,034 --> 00:22:22,065
Hey, wait!

251
00:22:23,912 --> 00:22:26,698
That's Becky.
She's not allowed to talk to us.

252
00:22:26,914 --> 00:22:28,113
Why not?

253
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,707
She's a servant girl,
and she has dark skin.

254
00:22:32,337 --> 00:22:33,499
So?

255
00:22:33,754 --> 00:22:36,874
Well, doesn't that mean something?

256
00:23:21,798 --> 00:23:23,126
l'm sorry, l--

257
00:23:23,340 --> 00:23:25,583
ls there anything
l can do for you, miss?

258
00:23:25,844 --> 00:23:28,760
l just came up here
to change my shoes.

259
00:23:29,638 --> 00:23:31,596
No, there's nothing.

260
00:23:31,808 --> 00:23:35,970
Begging your pardon, but we'll
both be in trouble if you stay.

261
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:43,898
All right, girls, pair up.

262
00:23:46,070 --> 00:23:47,777
Pair up.

263
00:24:39,535 --> 00:24:42,572
''Sir Edward saw the sorrow
in his daughter's eyes. . .

264
00:24:42,830 --> 00:24:46,033
. . .but he knew
that family honor must prevail.

265
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:48,746
Nobility was not to be trifled with.

266
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:51,666
'l beg of you, Charlotte,' he said.

267
00:24:51,881 --> 00:24:54,548
'Marry Sir John in the spring,
as he has asked.' ''

268
00:24:54,757 --> 00:24:56,383
Thank you, Lavinia.

269
00:24:56,635 --> 00:24:58,793
Sara, you may take your turn.

270
00:25:10,481 --> 00:25:14,098
''Charlotte said to her father,
'Father, you are right.

271
00:25:14,317 --> 00:25:17,851
l must put away my foolish fancies
and childhood wishes.' ''

272
00:25:28,414 --> 00:25:30,073
But l simply won't do it.

273
00:25:30,582 --> 00:25:31,780
l'm sorry, Father.

274
00:25:32,041 --> 00:25:33,833
When l marry, it'll be for love.

275
00:25:34,252 --> 00:25:37,501
And with that,
Charlotte ran from the house.

276
00:25:37,755 --> 00:25:40,590
Waiting outside was
the handsome stable boy, Pierre. . .

277
00:25:40,841 --> 00:25:42,549
. . .whom Charlotte secretly adored.

278
00:25:43,009 --> 00:25:47,802
Together they escaped to the coast
and quickly set sail for Tahiti.

279
00:25:48,057 --> 00:25:52,802
When they were halfway there,
their ship was attacked by pirates!

280
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,309
Rather than be eaten alive. . .

281
00:25:55,563 --> 00:25:58,398
. . .they threw
themselves into the sea.

282
00:25:58,608 --> 00:26:00,231
As they began to drown. . .

283
00:26:00,441 --> 00:26:04,522
. . .they held each other close,
and swore undying love.

284
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:10,576
Then, when all seemed lost,
a group of mermaids appeared--

285
00:26:10,785 --> 00:26:11,947
Stop!

286
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,415
What are you doing?

287
00:26:18,917 --> 00:26:23,626
l couldn't bear to see her marry him,
so l imagined another ending.

288
00:26:23,839 --> 00:26:24,953
lmagined it?

289
00:26:26,382 --> 00:26:28,588
Don't you ever do that, miss?

290
00:26:28,968 --> 00:26:32,134
Believe in something,
just to make it seem real?

291
00:26:35,058 --> 00:26:37,927
That's easy for a child
who has everything.

292
00:26:38,728 --> 00:26:42,178
There will be no more make-believe
at this school. . .

293
00:26:42,439 --> 00:26:44,312
. . .during reading
or any other time.

294
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:47,644
-ls that understood?
-Yes, Miss Minchin.

295
00:26:48,069 --> 00:26:49,978
All of you, go to your bed.

296
00:26:54,992 --> 00:26:57,826
l never heard a story like that
in my life.

297
00:26:58,078 --> 00:27:01,778
l bet you know lots of them,
don't you, Sara?

298
00:27:02,540 --> 00:27:04,997
l want silence up there!

299
00:27:06,336 --> 00:27:10,001
We have to do something about this
communication rule.

300
00:27:11,048 --> 00:27:13,290
After Minchin goes to bed. . .

301
00:27:13,551 --> 00:27:17,500
. . .we'll sneak into your room, and you
can show us a real story.

302
00:27:17,763 --> 00:27:19,305
How about it, Sara?

303
00:27:19,556 --> 00:27:21,680
Only if it's just you three.

304
00:27:44,620 --> 00:27:46,246
Come on, come on.

305
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,266
The evil Ravana locked the princess
up in his tower.

306
00:28:14,522 --> 00:28:16,682
There she stayed for many weeks. . .

307
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,356
. . .just staring out her window. . .

308
00:28:19,611 --> 00:28:22,066
. . .missing her Prince Rama terribly.

309
00:28:40,922 --> 00:28:42,084
Perfect.

310
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:45,167
You look just like Emily.

311
00:28:46,636 --> 00:28:50,963
My father hates dolls.
And he hates coming here.

312
00:28:51,305 --> 00:28:53,264
Says he doesn't belong.

313
00:28:53,517 --> 00:28:55,593
Then why does he send you?

314
00:28:55,936 --> 00:28:58,475
Because he wants me to belong.

315
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:33,750
My little girl. She spoke French!
She really spoke French.

316
00:29:36,307 --> 00:29:39,010
Your mother and l
are very proud of you.

317
00:29:46,983 --> 00:29:49,768
l caught you, Nellie!

318
00:30:15,091 --> 00:30:16,465
Papa!

319
00:31:06,139 --> 00:31:08,296
Randolph. . .John!

320
00:31:12,477 --> 00:31:15,014
Rama approached the thorny palace...

321
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:17,941
...unaware that Ravana
was waiting for him.

322
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,990
That's it!
l can't take it anymore!

323
00:31:32,203 --> 00:31:34,325
l don't care what you say
about Sara's stories.

324
00:31:34,539 --> 00:31:38,157
They have to be more fun than
watching your hair being combed!

325
00:31:39,418 --> 00:31:43,166
lf anyone else feels the same way,
she should leave too.

326
00:31:58,436 --> 00:32:00,807
But Ravana was not through yet.

327
00:32:01,354 --> 00:32:05,850
He took a bow that could
hold, not one, but 1 0 arrows. . .

328
00:32:06,234 --> 00:32:08,144
. . .each filled with poison.

329
00:32:08,403 --> 00:32:10,560
The arrows sped through the air. . .

330
00:32:10,862 --> 00:32:12,655
...heading straight for Rama.

331
00:32:13,408 --> 00:32:15,565
The arrows hit the ground...

332
00:32:15,826 --> 00:32:20,951
...and released their poison,
giant clouds of thick, yello w smoke.

333
00:33:27,516 --> 00:33:30,553
-l want a big piece!
-Hush up, Lottie.

334
00:33:30,811 --> 00:33:33,896
''Princess'' Sara will give
everyone a fair share.

335
00:33:34,565 --> 00:33:35,892
Right, Princess?

336
00:33:36,565 --> 00:33:38,808
l told her that's what you were.

337
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:42,235
Well, not just me.
All girls are princesses.

338
00:33:42,446 --> 00:33:45,898
Even snotty, two-faced bullies
like you, Lavinia.

339
00:33:58,629 --> 00:34:01,297
Here, Lavinia,
you get a big piece.

340
00:34:15,977 --> 00:34:17,720
Yes, may l help you?

341
00:34:17,979 --> 00:34:19,603
l'm Mr. Barrow.

342
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:22,932
Captain Crewe's solicitor.

343
00:34:23,234 --> 00:34:25,521
Oh, yes, do come in.

344
00:34:29,281 --> 00:34:33,527
-We're celebrating Sara's birthday.
-May l speak to you in private?

345
00:34:33,826 --> 00:34:36,496
Yes, of course.
Right this way.

346
00:35:10,153 --> 00:35:14,813
May l just say that Sara is quite
the favorite around here.

347
00:35:15,073 --> 00:35:18,905
We went to great lengths to make
this a special day for her.

348
00:35:32,254 --> 00:35:36,418
l'm afraid your check to us this month
will be rather large.

349
00:35:36,676 --> 00:35:39,842
There will be no check,
Miss Minchin.

350
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,054
Excuse me?

351
00:36:33,435 --> 00:36:37,978
The party is over! Everyone
go to their rooms, this instant!

352
00:36:38,231 --> 00:36:39,180
But we--

353
00:36:39,441 --> 00:36:41,434
Sara, you will stay behind.

354
00:36:42,194 --> 00:36:44,151
l have something to tell you.

355
00:36:45,030 --> 00:36:46,310
Move!

356
00:36:53,621 --> 00:36:57,451
Amelia, go to Sara's room
and find a simple black dress.

357
00:36:57,665 --> 00:37:00,074
lf nothing is suitable, borrow one.

358
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:02,541
-But, sister--
-Do as l say.

359
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:15,797
Why would l need a black dress,
Miss Minchin?

360
00:37:31,239 --> 00:37:34,108
l'm afraid l have some bad news, Sara.

361
00:37:36,243 --> 00:37:37,867
Your father has. . . .

362
00:37:40,329 --> 00:37:41,790
Your father--

363
00:37:43,916 --> 00:37:47,416
lt's been discovered that
your father has died.

364
00:37:48,255 --> 00:37:50,959
He was killed in battle
several weeks ago.

365
00:37:53,133 --> 00:37:54,295
l'm sorry.

366
00:37:55,261 --> 00:38:00,172
That's the situation, and
there's nothing we can do to change it.

367
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:06,844
The British government has seized
control of his company and assets. . .

368
00:38:07,271 --> 00:38:10,521
. . .leaving you penniless,
without any money.

369
00:38:10,817 --> 00:38:15,110
Since you've no relations,
this puts me in a terrible position.

370
00:38:17,615 --> 00:38:19,274
What are you staring at?

371
00:38:20,534 --> 00:38:22,858
Don't you understand
what l'm saying?

372
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:25,860
You are alone in the world. . .

373
00:38:28,123 --> 00:38:30,580
. . .unless l decide to keep you here. . .

374
00:38:30,835 --> 00:38:32,293
. . .out of charity.

375
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:48,219
Because of the expenses you've
incurred, all you own is mine...

376
00:38:48,476 --> 00:38:51,261
... your clothes, your toys, everything.

377
00:38:51,519 --> 00:38:55,897
lt'll hardly make up for
the financial losses l've suffered.

378
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:59,233
From now on, you must earn
your room and board.

379
00:38:59,444 --> 00:39:02,859
You'll move to the attic
and work as a servant.

380
00:39:04,698 --> 00:39:06,988
lf you fail to meet our standards...

381
00:39:07,243 --> 00:39:10,361
...or if you don 't obey,
you'll be thrown out.

382
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:15,662
And the streets of this city
are not kind to homeless beggars.

383
00:39:20,755 --> 00:39:24,206
Report to Mabel in the kitchen
promptly at 5 a.m.

384
00:39:27,886 --> 00:39:30,342
You could be arrested
for taking this.

385
00:39:31,932 --> 00:39:34,256
You're lucky l let you keep
that doll.

386
00:39:34,976 --> 00:39:36,436
You may have the book.

387
00:39:36,687 --> 00:39:38,808
But another incident like this. . .

388
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:41,310
. . .and l will call the authorities.

389
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:45,935
l expect you to remember,
Sara Crewe. . .

390
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,691
. . .you're not a princess any longer.

391
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,252
Papa.

392
00:41:17,069 --> 00:41:18,943
Papa, please.

393
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,479
Sara, what happened?

394
00:42:07,031 --> 00:42:10,945
You're to serve the girls
without conversation, understand?

395
00:42:11,618 --> 00:42:15,035
Sara will be working here
as a servant from now on.

396
00:42:15,289 --> 00:42:19,037
There will be no communication.
ls that clear?

397
00:42:19,375 --> 00:42:21,534
Yes, Miss Minchin.

398
00:42:37,225 --> 00:42:39,798
Seven times five is 35.

399
00:42:42,981 --> 00:42:44,689
Seven times six is 42.

400
00:43:27,605 --> 00:43:28,768
Let go!

401
00:44:09,644 --> 00:44:10,925
Great God!

402
00:44:11,187 --> 00:44:12,350
lt can't be!

403
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:14,390
lt's my son, John!

404
00:44:14,647 --> 00:44:15,928
Dear God, no.

405
00:44:16,191 --> 00:44:17,270
Not John.

406
00:44:17,525 --> 00:44:19,434
lt's John, Ram Dass!

407
00:44:20,069 --> 00:44:21,814
lt's John. Help me.

408
00:44:22,239 --> 00:44:24,479
-Come inside.
-Help.

409
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,490
l thought you'd be sleeping.

410
00:44:40,673 --> 00:44:44,004
l never got a chance
to give you your birthday present.

411
00:44:46,343 --> 00:44:48,668
lt's a picture of where you
used to live.

412
00:44:49,013 --> 00:44:52,677
See the blue threads?
That's the river.

413
00:44:53,684 --> 00:44:56,637
These are the mountains
you always talk about.

414
00:44:57,395 --> 00:44:59,222
Thank you, Becky.

415
00:45:00,148 --> 00:45:01,475
lt's beautiful.

416
00:45:06,570 --> 00:45:08,777
Why don't you tell stories anymore?

417
00:45:09,615 --> 00:45:13,528
They're just make-believe.
They don't mean anything.

418
00:45:14,285 --> 00:45:16,610
They've always meant something to me.

419
00:45:17,289 --> 00:45:21,581
Some days l thought l'd die, until
l heard you talk about the magic.

420
00:45:22,711 --> 00:45:24,703
There is no magic, Becky.

421
00:45:46,232 --> 00:45:47,726
Papa. . .

422
00:45:49,275 --> 00:45:51,185
. . .can you hear me?

423
00:45:52,821 --> 00:45:54,694
l'm so scared.

424
00:46:34,401 --> 00:46:36,606
Are you still a princess?

425
00:46:37,611 --> 00:46:41,360
You better get back in line
or we'll both be in trouble.

426
00:46:41,615 --> 00:46:42,480
Are you?

427
00:46:46,285 --> 00:46:47,781
Girls, get in line.

428
00:47:13,977 --> 00:47:15,175
Don't touch that!

429
00:47:15,478 --> 00:47:17,188
lt's for Mr. Randolph.

430
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,519
The poor man. His son is
missing in action in Europe.

431
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:24,812
You mean John?
He's such a nice boy.

432
00:47:37,833 --> 00:47:39,410
Here, little girl.

433
00:47:40,085 --> 00:47:42,658
l told you
not to give your money away.

434
00:47:46,841 --> 00:47:49,000
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

435
00:47:49,761 --> 00:47:51,836
You see?
You never get rid of them.

436
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:58,473
May l help you?

437
00:48:03,199 --> 00:48:05,239
Would you like to buy a flower?

438
00:48:06,370 --> 00:48:08,577
Would you like to buy a flower?

439
00:48:08,873 --> 00:48:10,581
-Would you?
-Not today.

440
00:48:12,586 --> 00:48:15,160
Would you like to buy a flower?

441
00:48:25,727 --> 00:48:26,676
Would you?

442
00:48:39,078 --> 00:48:39,908
Pardon me.

443
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,339
Give her a flower.

444
00:48:50,133 --> 00:48:51,129
Wait!

445
00:48:58,644 --> 00:48:59,973
For the princess.

446
00:50:38,561 --> 00:50:40,436
What is it, little mouse?

447
00:50:40,981 --> 00:50:42,974
Are you a prisoner too?

448
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:50,193
ls it ever this cold
where you come from?

449
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:52,197
No.

450
00:50:53,580 --> 00:50:57,994
Tell me about it, Sara.
Tell me again about lndia.

451
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:05,125
lndia.

452
00:51:05,554 --> 00:51:06,882
Tell me.

453
00:51:07,848 --> 00:51:08,963
Well. . .

454
00:51:09,767 --> 00:51:12,341
. . .the air is so hot there. . .

455
00:51:13,564 --> 00:51:16,055
. . .you can almost taste it.

456
00:51:17,777 --> 00:51:20,020
l bet it tastes like coconuts.

457
00:51:21,407 --> 00:51:24,029
lt's more like spices, really.

458
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:26,696
Curry and saffron.

459
00:51:27,707 --> 00:51:28,703
What else?

460
00:51:33,380 --> 00:51:36,252
Tigers sleep under trees. . .

461
00:51:37,052 --> 00:51:40,635
. . .and elephants cool themselves
in the lakes.

462
00:51:41,224 --> 00:51:44,475
The warm wind blows
through the fields. . .

463
00:51:44,978 --> 00:51:47,351
...and the spirits ride it...

464
00:51:47,899 --> 00:51:50,569
...singing as they look down on us.

465
00:51:51,236 --> 00:51:54,571
Their voices echo
through the mountains...

466
00:51:55,074 --> 00:51:56,818
...and the sky...

467
00:51:57,077 --> 00:51:59,035
...is all different colors...

468
00:52:00,414 --> 00:52:02,657
...like a peacock's tail.

469
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,570
Soot all over the place,
you clumsy fool!

470
00:54:11,788 --> 00:54:12,737
Get out!

471
00:54:12,956 --> 00:54:14,748
Get out of my house!

472
00:54:15,376 --> 00:54:18,046
And you can forget
being paid this week!

473
00:54:18,296 --> 00:54:20,171
Ungrateful little wretch.

474
00:54:20,591 --> 00:54:22,133
No, you don't!

475
00:54:22,385 --> 00:54:25,387
l won't tolerate
any soot in this house!

476
00:54:25,639 --> 00:54:29,590
There, just look at my boot!
lt's filthy!

477
00:54:30,812 --> 00:54:31,642
Out!

478
00:54:31,897 --> 00:54:35,848
Out! And take this
ridiculous-looking thing with you!

479
00:55:42,694 --> 00:55:45,400
Where might Miss Amelia be
this morning?

480
00:55:45,656 --> 00:55:49,073
Good morning, Frances.
You're here early this morning.

481
00:55:49,328 --> 00:55:53,742
A working man gets up early if he
wants to have an effect on the world.

482
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,199
How true.

483
00:55:55,669 --> 00:55:58,671
And what a powerful effect you have,
Frances.

484
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:41,051
Where have you been?

485
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:45,558
l've been chilled for half an hour.
Hurry up and light a fire.

486
00:56:45,982 --> 00:56:49,186
And don't touch anything
else with your dirty hands.

487
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:53,527
This is my room now,
and l won't have you messing it up.

488
00:56:58,123 --> 00:57:03,118
What is that awful smell?
When did you last have a bath?

489
00:57:10,805 --> 00:57:12,466
What are you doing?

490
00:57:12,891 --> 00:57:14,884
l don't believe in this!

491
00:57:15,478 --> 00:57:19,097
So you can just stop it!
Stop it, l said!

492
00:57:23,905 --> 00:57:25,565
What did you just do?

493
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:28,570
Just a little curse l learned
from a witch in lndia.

494
00:57:28,828 --> 00:57:30,073
Curse?

495
00:57:32,541 --> 00:57:35,163
-What kind of curse?
-You'll see.

496
00:57:35,586 --> 00:57:39,371
But l wouldn't brush my hair as much
if l were you.

497
00:57:51,607 --> 00:57:54,941
lt's all right.
l saved it especially for you.

498
00:57:56,112 --> 00:57:58,022
Go on. Take it.

499
00:58:24,815 --> 00:58:26,773
ls this where you live?

500
00:58:27,026 --> 00:58:30,728
You shouldn't be here.
lt's too dangerous.

501
00:58:31,574 --> 00:58:35,703
Why don't you like me anymore?
Did l do something wrong?

502
00:58:35,954 --> 00:58:37,746
No, of course not.

503
00:58:37,998 --> 00:58:41,499
l didn't think you'd
want me for a friend. . .

504
00:58:42,212 --> 00:58:45,000
. . .now that things are different.

505
00:58:45,550 --> 00:58:48,919
l'm sure you could do fine without
me for a friend. . .

506
00:58:49,179 --> 00:58:52,015
. . .but l couldn't get along
without you.

507
00:58:53,643 --> 00:58:55,186
l'm sorry.
l should've known. . .

508
00:58:55,395 --> 00:58:58,065
. . .you wouldn't be like the others.

509
00:58:58,316 --> 00:59:01,187
-What's that?
-One knock means ''l'm here. ''

510
00:59:02,780 --> 00:59:05,402
Two knocks means ''All is well. ''

511
00:59:06,034 --> 00:59:08,656
Three means
''The coast is clear. ''

512
00:59:08,912 --> 00:59:13,575
-''The demon Minchinweed is asleep. ''
-lt all sounds so adventurous!

513
00:59:13,835 --> 00:59:16,457
Look, Becky. We have a visitor.

514
00:59:16,964 --> 00:59:18,672
Hello, Becky.

515
00:59:19,551 --> 00:59:22,552
Oh, Sara, l miss your stories so much.

516
00:59:23,180 --> 00:59:27,131
Won't you tell us what happened
to Rama and the princess?

517
00:59:27,394 --> 00:59:30,016
The smoke from Ravana 's arrows...

518
00:59:30,273 --> 00:59:32,598
...finally began to lift.

519
00:59:33,443 --> 00:59:35,483
Rama lay dead on the ground.

520
00:59:36,238 --> 00:59:37,519
Oh, no!

521
00:59:37,782 --> 00:59:40,618
But then
a wonderful thing happened.

522
00:59:41,620 --> 00:59:46,497
The gazelle laid down next to Rama,
giving him his own life.

523
00:59:58,558 --> 01:00:00,847
He's suffering from amnesia...

524
01:00:01,103 --> 01:00:04,105
. . .one of the rare side effects
of poison gas.

525
01:00:04,357 --> 01:00:06,599
His eyes will heal in time.

526
01:00:06,860 --> 01:00:09,482
His memory. . .who can say?

527
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:11,281
He's not my son.

528
01:00:13,494 --> 01:00:15,617
l'm sorry, Mr. Randolph.

529
01:00:16,456 --> 01:00:18,330
He was in severe shock. . .

530
01:00:18,583 --> 01:00:21,253
. . .with no coat, no identification.

531
01:00:22,046 --> 01:00:25,083
Since your son was the only name
unaccounted for. . .

532
01:00:25,342 --> 01:00:27,631
. . .they assumed this was John.

533
01:00:29,472 --> 01:00:31,050
l am sorry.

534
01:00:40,569 --> 01:00:43,654
All the hoping.
You must think me a fool.

535
01:00:44,741 --> 01:00:47,233
ls it your wish to be wise, sahib?

536
01:00:47,578 --> 01:00:49,073
l don't know.

537
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:53,617
l suppose a wise man
wouldn't have come here at all.

538
01:00:53,878 --> 01:00:55,207
But if he had. . .

539
01:00:55,463 --> 01:00:58,915
. . .he would have looked
closely upon the soldier's face.

540
01:01:00,928 --> 01:01:02,553
What would he have seen?

541
01:01:02,764 --> 01:01:06,763
Pain, sahib.
He needs to be cared for.

542
01:01:08,354 --> 01:01:10,229
He's not my responsibility.

543
01:01:10,482 --> 01:01:14,695
A wise man would remember
that this man was in John's regiment.

544
01:01:14,946 --> 01:01:20,072
lf his memory returns, he might
tell what happened to his son.

545
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:26,411
Perhaps sahib will learn
that John is in British hospital. . .

546
01:01:26,669 --> 01:01:31,795
. . .wishing that a kind man would
take him home, away from his pain.

547
01:01:36,598 --> 01:01:39,600
lf the plumber comes,
show him the problem.

548
01:01:39,852 --> 01:01:43,056
And don't babble with him.
He's paid by the hour.

549
01:01:43,315 --> 01:01:46,685
And correct the Latin tests
by the time l get back.

550
01:01:46,945 --> 01:01:48,190
Yes, sister.

551
01:01:53,661 --> 01:01:55,738
Hello, Miss Minchin.

552
01:01:57,208 --> 01:01:58,619
Goodbye, Miss Minchin.

553
01:02:26,286 --> 01:02:27,531
Oh, no, not again!

554
01:02:33,003 --> 01:02:34,378
Lottie, not again.

555
01:02:54,655 --> 01:02:56,447
Let's find the locket.

556
01:02:58,284 --> 01:02:59,909
All right. . .

557
01:03:00,913 --> 01:03:03,072
. . .it's okay. lt's all right.

558
01:03:32,953 --> 01:03:35,160
Come quick!
l think Lottie's possessed.

559
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:07,486
l got it.

560
01:04:13,421 --> 01:04:16,339
Will you please get that child
under control?

561
01:04:16,206 --> 01:04:18,163
Not to worry. Everything's fine.

562
01:04:48,924 --> 01:04:50,039
What is it?

563
01:04:53,221 --> 01:04:55,048
l thought l saw a mouse.

564
01:05:15,040 --> 01:05:16,499
Hello.

565
01:05:25,762 --> 01:05:28,432
l swear, that child has
a pact with Satan to destroy me.

566
01:05:28,682 --> 01:05:31,470
l'm not cut out for this job.
l have no patience.

567
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:34,765
And teaching!
All those horrible facts to remember.

568
01:05:35,023 --> 01:05:36,601
l don't like it at all.

569
01:05:36,859 --> 01:05:39,267
You like Frances, don't you?

570
01:05:39,529 --> 01:05:40,609
What?

571
01:05:41,156 --> 01:05:43,944
Of course not. How dare you.

572
01:05:44,160 --> 01:05:45,619
l think he likes you too.

573
01:05:47,498 --> 01:05:48,873
You do?

574
01:05:50,001 --> 01:05:50,950
Really?

575
01:05:51,169 --> 01:05:54,124
l think you should run away together
and get married.

576
01:05:54,339 --> 01:05:56,665
lt'd be terribly romantic.

577
01:05:57,510 --> 01:06:00,002
What an extraordinary thing to say.

578
01:06:09,108 --> 01:06:14,234
Well, anyway, my sister would be
furious if she found out.

579
01:06:14,448 --> 01:06:16,691
So?
-You'd be long gone by then.

580
01:06:16,993 --> 01:06:19,485
Living in some exotic paradise. . .

581
01:06:19,746 --> 01:06:22,665
. . .with that dashing young milkman.

582
01:06:25,170 --> 01:06:27,875
l'd better get to the market.

583
01:06:48,992 --> 01:06:51,068
You're doing well, young man.

584
01:06:51,370 --> 01:06:53,078
You're almost home.

585
01:06:55,333 --> 01:06:58,335
You must trust my eyes, sahib.

586
01:07:26,497 --> 01:07:27,908
What's going on?

587
01:07:28,166 --> 01:07:29,411
lt's a surprise.

588
01:07:34,257 --> 01:07:37,508
-What are you doing here?
-We brought you something.

589
01:07:42,142 --> 01:07:45,761
Princess Sara, we present you with
something we rescued.

590
01:07:46,481 --> 01:07:48,141
ln a dangerous adventure.

591
01:07:48,358 --> 01:07:51,443
-Our very own crusade.
-Risking all our lives.

592
01:07:51,654 --> 01:07:53,148
And mine too.

593
01:08:01,666 --> 01:08:03,909
l don't know what to say.

594
01:08:06,798 --> 01:08:10,749
You are the best friends
anyone could ever ask for.

595
01:08:14,599 --> 01:08:15,430
lt's all right.

596
01:08:15,684 --> 01:08:18,639
lt's just my little monkey friend,
Hanuman.

597
01:08:19,689 --> 01:08:22,181
Where did he come from?

598
01:08:22,609 --> 01:08:24,437
Right next door. Look.

599
01:08:26,072 --> 01:08:27,650
He likes to visit me.

600
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:30,359
Can you really talk to him, Sara?

601
01:08:31,621 --> 01:08:34,955
Hanuman, say hello to all my friends.

602
01:08:56,152 --> 01:08:59,106
After Rama came back to life. . .

603
01:08:59,364 --> 01:09:03,315
...he raced towards the monster's
palace to rescue Sita.

604
01:09:03,619 --> 01:09:04,533
Suddenly...

605
01:09:05,080 --> 01:09:07,037
...Ravana appeared!

606
01:09:21,851 --> 01:09:25,102
l think we better save
the rest for later.

607
01:09:42,961 --> 01:09:44,669
What's going on here?

608
01:09:45,130 --> 01:09:47,586
lt's not their fault.
l asked them to come.

609
01:09:47,842 --> 01:09:49,420
You five go downstairs.

610
01:09:49,636 --> 01:09:51,214
l'll deal with you later.

611
01:09:52,681 --> 01:09:53,547
Becky. . .

612
01:09:54,100 --> 01:09:57,766
. . .you'll remain locked in your room
tomorrow without meals.

613
01:09:58,021 --> 01:09:59,017
Go!

614
01:10:01,985 --> 01:10:05,686
And you will perform her chores
in addition to your own. . .

615
01:10:05,948 --> 01:10:08,487
. . .without breakfast, lunch or dinner.

616
01:10:08,701 --> 01:10:10,244
lt's time you learned. . .

617
01:10:10,454 --> 01:10:14,287
. . .that real life has nothing to do
with your fantasy games.

618
01:10:14,542 --> 01:10:17,164
lt's a cruel,
nasty world out there. . .

619
01:10:17,421 --> 01:10:20,126
. . .and it's our duty
to make the best of it.

620
01:10:20,383 --> 01:10:25,509
Not to indulge in ridiculous dreams,
but to be productive and useful.

621
01:10:28,935 --> 01:10:31,641
Do you understand what l'm saying?

622
01:10:34,359 --> 01:10:35,734
Yes, ma'am.

623
01:10:38,197 --> 01:10:39,360
Good.

624
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:44,662
But l don't believe in it.

625
01:10:47,792 --> 01:10:50,877
Don't tell me you still
fancy yourself a princess.

626
01:10:51,839 --> 01:10:54,378
Good God, child, look around you!

627
01:10:54,885 --> 01:10:57,507
Or better yet, look in the mirror.

628
01:11:05,231 --> 01:11:06,856
l am a princess.

629
01:11:07,108 --> 01:11:08,733
All girls are.

630
01:11:09,069 --> 01:11:11,822
Even if they live
in tiny old attics.

631
01:11:12,115 --> 01:11:14,404
Even if they dress in rags.

632
01:11:15,285 --> 01:11:18,738
Even if they aren't pretty
or smart or young.

633
01:11:19,165 --> 01:11:22,831
They're still princesses.
All of us.

634
01:11:24,088 --> 01:11:26,627
Didn't your father ever tell you that?

635
01:11:27,426 --> 01:11:28,588
Didn't he?

636
01:11:32,891 --> 01:11:35,382
lf l find you up here
with the girls again. . .

637
01:11:35,644 --> 01:11:38,266
. . .l'll throw you out
into the street!

638
01:12:11,773 --> 01:12:13,398
What're we going to do?

639
01:12:14,777 --> 01:12:17,185
A whole day with nothing to eat.

640
01:12:17,739 --> 01:12:19,483
Don't cry, Becky.

641
01:12:19,825 --> 01:12:21,450
l'm scared.

642
01:12:21,702 --> 01:12:25,238
lf Minchin throws me out,
l've got no place to go.

643
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:27,953
That's not true.

644
01:12:28,461 --> 01:12:33,088
l'm here with you. l've always
thought of us as sisters.

645
01:12:33,843 --> 01:12:35,041
You have?

646
01:12:35,303 --> 01:12:38,838
Let's make a promise
to always look out for each other.

647
01:12:39,141 --> 01:12:40,220
lt's a promise.

648
01:12:43,188 --> 01:12:46,308
Now, what are we going to do
about food?

649
01:12:47,193 --> 01:12:48,901
Starve, l guess.

650
01:12:49,153 --> 01:12:52,321
No, there's only one thing to do.

651
01:12:52,574 --> 01:12:55,660
We'll eat a great feast
before we go to sleep. . .

652
01:12:55,912 --> 01:12:58,201
. . .and that will
keep us full tomorrow.

653
01:12:58,415 --> 01:13:01,251
Feast? What feast?

654
01:13:01,502 --> 01:13:03,377
Just look around.

655
01:13:04,590 --> 01:13:06,381
See that table there?

656
01:13:07,009 --> 01:13:09,216
lt's covered with a beautiful cloth. . .

657
01:13:09,471 --> 01:13:10,716
. . .and candles. . .

658
01:13:11,056 --> 01:13:13,808
. . .and trays
of good things to eat.

659
01:13:15,645 --> 01:13:16,890
Come on, Becky.

660
01:13:17,189 --> 01:13:20,274
Tell me what kind of food there is.

661
01:13:20,818 --> 01:13:23,357
But l don't see any food.

662
01:13:23,614 --> 01:13:25,322
Try, Becky.

663
01:13:25,616 --> 01:13:29,282
Just make-believe it.
Remember what you told me?

664
01:13:29,538 --> 01:13:31,246
About the magic?

665
01:13:40,677 --> 01:13:43,714
-Muffins?
-Good! What kind?

666
01:13:43,972 --> 01:13:45,551
All kinds.

667
01:13:45,808 --> 01:13:50,388
Every kind of muffin God ever made,
and all of them hot.

668
01:13:50,648 --> 01:13:52,107
Good!

669
01:13:54,527 --> 01:13:58,028
But we're not dressed right
for such an elegant banquet.

670
01:14:00,535 --> 01:14:05,163
l'm wearing a long velvet cape
with fur on the collar.

671
01:14:05,625 --> 01:14:06,490
And you?

672
01:14:06,751 --> 01:14:09,872
Well,
l always liked diamonds myself.

673
01:14:10,297 --> 01:14:14,676
Rings and bracelets,
and a whole dress covered with them.

674
01:14:16,847 --> 01:14:19,054
Smell those sausages!

675
01:14:19,309 --> 01:14:21,017
l love sausages.

676
01:15:52,676 --> 01:15:54,135
Oh, my Lord!

677
01:15:56,598 --> 01:15:59,469
l think you went
a little too far this time.

678
01:15:59,727 --> 01:16:01,221
lt wasn't me.

679
01:16:06,026 --> 01:16:07,521
Go ahead.

680
01:16:21,087 --> 01:16:24,172
l feel like l've been
touched by an angel.

681
01:16:24,425 --> 01:16:25,374
Look!

682
01:16:25,676 --> 01:16:27,171
Just what we ordered.

683
01:16:27,971 --> 01:16:30,047
l'm a little scared about this.

684
01:16:30,808 --> 01:16:33,513
Me too.
Do you think we shouldn't eat it?

685
01:16:33,770 --> 01:16:35,229
l'm not that scared.

686
01:16:48,413 --> 01:16:52,115
Thank you for your kindness.
l'm sorry to inconvenience you.

687
01:16:52,376 --> 01:16:53,705
lt is nothing, sahib.

688
01:16:59,594 --> 01:17:00,757
That word. . . .

689
01:17:03,015 --> 01:17:04,675
lt sounds so familiar. . .

690
01:17:05,017 --> 01:17:08,387
. . .yet l don't know what it means.

691
01:17:08,647 --> 01:17:12,231
lt is not English.
We use it where l am from.

692
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:14,398
ln lndia.

693
01:17:17,324 --> 01:17:18,238
lndia. . . .

694
01:17:18,618 --> 01:17:19,947
You know it?

695
01:17:23,123 --> 01:17:24,286
No.

696
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:27,583
Everything's just a blur.

697
01:17:31,050 --> 01:17:33,257
Maybe someday l'll sort it out.

698
01:17:34,096 --> 01:17:35,721
You will, sahib.

699
01:17:37,099 --> 01:17:38,642
You will.

700
01:18:35,298 --> 01:18:36,840
Yoo-hoo?

701
01:18:55,615 --> 01:18:56,860
One minute.

702
01:19:22,315 --> 01:19:23,644
Oh, my God.

703
01:19:37,251 --> 01:19:38,876
Where is it?

704
01:19:39,337 --> 01:19:40,665
Where's the locket?

705
01:19:40,922 --> 01:19:42,666
Give it to me!

706
01:19:46,179 --> 01:19:47,554
What is all this?

707
01:19:48,890 --> 01:19:50,005
Where'd it come from?

708
01:19:50,267 --> 01:19:52,640
l don't know.
l just woke up and it was here.

709
01:19:52,895 --> 01:19:55,683
You stole it,
like you stole this locket!

710
01:19:56,567 --> 01:19:58,893
You're nothing but a dirty
little thief.

711
01:19:59,362 --> 01:20:03,776
lt's my responsibility to protect
the children from animals like you.

712
01:20:04,034 --> 01:20:07,700
You'll be leaving
with the police very shortly!

713
01:20:09,792 --> 01:20:11,619
No, Miss Minchin!

714
01:20:12,253 --> 01:20:13,796
l didn't do it.

715
01:20:14,464 --> 01:20:16,256
Miss Minchin, please!

716
01:20:16,508 --> 01:20:19,047
Miss Minchin, l didn't do it!

717
01:20:33,572 --> 01:20:37,024
You heard me.
l want her picked up immediately!

718
01:20:55,808 --> 01:20:58,050
You've removed the bandages.

719
01:20:58,311 --> 01:21:01,348
There wasn't much point.
l can see all right.

720
01:21:02,316 --> 01:21:04,523
Come on in, have a brandy.

721
01:21:19,129 --> 01:21:20,754
Don't worry.

722
01:21:21,590 --> 01:21:23,833
l'm sure they'll believe you.

723
01:21:25,345 --> 01:21:27,469
l have to get out.

724
01:21:27,723 --> 01:21:31,175
But how? My room's locked too.

725
01:21:44,828 --> 01:21:46,026
The police, they're here!

726
01:21:48,458 --> 01:21:51,210
Let's go, boys.
Step lively now.

727
01:22:05,813 --> 01:22:08,055
Quick, help me with this board!

728
01:22:08,316 --> 01:22:10,605
-Right this way.
-Yes, madam.

729
01:22:25,421 --> 01:22:26,963
You'll fall!

730
01:22:28,174 --> 01:22:29,717
l can do it.

731
01:22:29,968 --> 01:22:33,670
l'll come back for you.
l promise.

732
01:23:01,132 --> 01:23:02,841
What is she doing?

733
01:23:03,636 --> 01:23:05,130
Get back in here!

734
01:23:32,380 --> 01:23:36,877
-The little beast is running away!
-We're trying, miss.

735
01:23:56,035 --> 01:23:56,984
Good God!

736
01:24:16,644 --> 01:24:19,681
Don't just stand there!
Go and find her!

737
01:24:25,530 --> 01:24:27,820
Take this one while you're at it.

738
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:46,632
l heard you calling
in your sleep last night.

739
01:24:47,183 --> 01:24:51,133
Sometimes when l dream,
l sense a part of me that's missing.

740
01:24:51,897 --> 01:24:55,598
lt's strange, having your heart
remember what your mind can't.

741
01:24:59,323 --> 01:25:01,197
She jumped like a little animal.

742
01:25:04,788 --> 01:25:06,532
Who's that at this hour?

743
01:25:12,298 --> 01:25:13,377
Let us in, man.

744
01:25:14,217 --> 01:25:16,969
A child from the school
is in your house.

745
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:18,383
What's going on?

746
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:21,303
l'm sorry, but there's a child
hiding in your house.

747
01:25:21,601 --> 01:25:23,179
-What?
-Search upstairs.

748
01:25:27,191 --> 01:25:28,390
Oh, not now!

749
01:25:28,693 --> 01:25:30,567
Ram Dass, get some candles!

750
01:25:34,617 --> 01:25:37,156
-Start with the attic.
-Let's go.

751
01:25:37,454 --> 01:25:38,403
Quickly!

752
01:25:41,084 --> 01:25:41,914
Who's there?

753
01:25:58,397 --> 01:26:02,099
Make sure you check the closets
and under the beds!

754
01:26:08,285 --> 01:26:09,566
What is it?

755
01:26:10,204 --> 01:26:11,663
Why are you crying?

756
01:26:16,003 --> 01:26:19,207
Please tell me.
l won't hurt you.

757
01:26:21,134 --> 01:26:22,926
Won't you tell me your name?

758
01:26:36,320 --> 01:26:38,278
That's such a pretty name.

759
01:26:53,717 --> 01:26:54,962
Papa.

760
01:27:02,770 --> 01:27:04,015
Papa.

761
01:27:04,689 --> 01:27:05,887
What did you say?

762
01:27:07,526 --> 01:27:10,397
-l'm sorry.
-Papa, it's me, Sara.

763
01:27:10,697 --> 01:27:11,860
Do you know me?

764
01:27:12,157 --> 01:27:13,486
Don't you remember me?

765
01:27:13,951 --> 01:27:14,982
Please. . .

766
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:18,246
. . .you've got to know me.
lt's Sara. Remember?

767
01:27:18,498 --> 01:27:20,705
Remember lndia and Maya?

768
01:27:21,001 --> 01:27:22,330
Remember the Ramayana. . .

769
01:27:22,712 --> 01:27:25,583
. . .and Emily?
The locket with Mama's picture?

770
01:27:26,300 --> 01:27:28,127
Oh, Papa, please!

771
01:27:29,178 --> 01:27:30,092
Papa, please!

772
01:27:30,346 --> 01:27:31,509
Do you know this man?

773
01:27:31,765 --> 01:27:32,679
Tell them!

774
01:27:36,145 --> 01:27:39,313
This child has no father.
Take her away!

775
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:44,734
Papa!

776
01:27:45,324 --> 01:27:47,032
l'm so sorry.

777
01:28:11,607 --> 01:28:12,722
Sara!

778
01:28:22,370 --> 01:28:24,743
Papa, don't ever leave me!

779
01:28:38,098 --> 01:28:39,842
-l missed you.
-l love you.

780
01:29:36,338 --> 01:29:39,708
Well, well, well.
l hardly recognized you.

781
01:29:40,385 --> 01:29:42,674
l'm glad you straightened
everything out.

782
01:29:42,888 --> 01:29:45,261
They released all my property.

783
01:29:46,142 --> 01:29:47,851
l came to say goodbye. . .

784
01:29:48,061 --> 01:29:51,312
. . .and to thank you
for everything you've done for us.

785
01:29:51,816 --> 01:29:54,438
No more than you tried to do for my son.

786
01:29:55,905 --> 01:29:59,109
-Take care, Mr. Randolph.
-And you too.

787
01:29:59,534 --> 01:30:02,406
You must be glad
to be going home.

788
01:30:03,498 --> 01:30:04,447
Thank you.

789
01:30:28,863 --> 01:30:31,105
l have a surprise for you all.

790
01:30:35,621 --> 01:30:40,581
Whenever you think of me, tell Emily,
and she'll get the message to me.

791
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:45,049
And when you hug her, you'll really
be getting a hug from me.

792
01:30:45,259 --> 01:30:47,382
Then we'll hug her every day.

793
01:31:15,171 --> 01:31:17,959
That's the first time
anyone's hugged Lavinia.

794
01:31:22,180 --> 01:31:23,556
Bye, Becky.

795
01:31:24,516 --> 01:31:25,715
Come on.

796
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:36,068
Yeah, l'm coming, l'm coming.

797
01:31:36,490 --> 01:31:39,942
Get over here.
l've been looking for you, Minchin.

798
01:31:40,161 --> 01:31:42,783
-Pick up the bucket.
-When do l get my break?

799
01:31:42,998 --> 01:31:44,327
Follow me!

800
01:31:45,209 --> 01:31:47,582
What do you put in here, rocks?
