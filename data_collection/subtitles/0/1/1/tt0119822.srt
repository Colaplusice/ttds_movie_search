1
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,900
I'm just going to get some flowers,
dear.

2
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:38,000
It's tulip season today
and I'm so happy.

3
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,300
- Son of a bitch.
- Come on, sweetie.

4
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,400
Come on, sweetie.

5
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:55,400
Come on now, sweetheart.

6
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,500
Go for a little ride,
then you can whiz all over the city.

7
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:07,800
Come on, go for a ride.

8
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:10,000
No! Freeze!

9
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,800
Leg down! Leg down!

10
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:17,700
That's it. Come on.

11
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
No! You monkey-eared son of a ...

12
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:28,900
You have pissed your last floor.

13
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:33,800
I'll bet you wish
you were a real ...

14
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:37,200
You dog-eared monkey.

15
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:43,700
This is New York. If you can make it
here you can make it anywhere.

16
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:55,200
Verdell?

17
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,400
Verdell?

18
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:03,200
Where's my good doggie? Verdell?

19
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:07,000
Come here, sweetheart.

20
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:10,000
Mr. Udall?

21
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:16,900
- Have you seen Verdell?
- What does he look like?

22
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:26,200
My dog. You know ...
My dog with the adorable face.

23
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,600
- Don't you know what it looks like?
- You were talking about your dog.

24
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,300
I thought it was that coloured man.

25
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:40,900
Which colour was that?

26
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,300
Thick molasses with a broad nose.

27
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,700
- Perfect for smelling prison food.
- Frank!

28
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,500
- You have got to get dressed.
- Frank Sachs. Melvin Udall.

29
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:59,600
Frank shows my work, Mr. Udall.
I think you know that.

30
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:04,100
As long as you keep your work
zipped up, around me, -

31
00:03:04,300 --> 00:03:07,100
- I don't care
where you shove your show.

32
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:12,100
Are we done being neighbours?

33
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:20,100
- Let me ...
- No! Not worth it.

34
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:32,600
- Hope you find him. Love that dog.
- You don't love anything.

35
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,700
One, two, three, four, five.

36
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:03,500
One, two, three, four, five.

37
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:27,500
Hot. Hot, hot, hot.

38
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:51,400
- Where is he?
- He had a thing with the dog.

39
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:54,600
- Ugly dog.
- He's adorable.

40
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:02,100
My honey. Where have you been?

41
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:07,700
Look at my boy.

42
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,700
- I found him, Mr. Bishop.
- We know you did.

43
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:18,300
Where was my baby?

44
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:25,900
ln the basement garbage bin
eating diaper shit.

45
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:32,000
- You earned your fun, John.
- It just struck me as funny.

46
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:39,100
How did he get down there?
Even if he got in the elevator ...

47
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:44,600
Maybe some nice neighbour
shoved him down the garbage chute.

48
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:52,900
''ln the dark she had confessed
and he had forgiven.''

49
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:56,000
''This is what you live for,
he said.''

50
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,900
''Two heads on a pillow.
All is approval.''

51
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:04,900
''There is only the safety
of being with each other.''

52
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,800
''How could she find such hope
in the most shameful part of her?''

53
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,500
- Mr. Udall!
- ''She was able to define love.''

54
00:06:16,700 --> 00:06:19,100
''Love was ...''

55
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:24,900
Mr. Udall, I'd like to speak to you.
Let me do this by myself.

56
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,500
- ''Love was ...''
- Are you in there?

57
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:32,800
Pansy-assed stool-pusher!

58
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,900
Yes?

59
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:38,600
This can wait.

60
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
I found Verdell, Mr. Udall.

61
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:51,400
Well ... That's a load off.

62
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:55,700
Did you ... do something to him?

63
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,700
Do you realize
that I work at home?

64
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,900
Do you like being interrupted
when you're playing in your garden?

65
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:13,800
No,
I turn the ringer off on my phone.

66
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,000
- And put a piece of cardboard ...
- I work all the time.

67
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:22,300
So never interrupt me!

68
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:27,200
Not if you hear the sound of a thud
from my home, -

69
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,200
- and one week later there's a smell
from a decaying human body, -

70
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,700
- and you have to hold a hanky
to your face because of the stench.

71
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:41,500
Even then, don't come knocking.

72
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:47,500
Or if it's election night
and you want to celebrate, -

73
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:53,200
- because some fudge-packer was
elected the first queer president.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:58,300
And he's going to have you
down to Camp David, -

75
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,500
- and you want someone
to share the moment with.

76
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:08,200
Even then, don't knock.
Not on this door.

77
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,800
Not for any reason.

78
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,700
Do you get me, sweetheart?

79
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:23,200
Yes. It's not a subtle point
that you are making.

80
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:27,400
Okay, then.

81
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:44,500
So, now he will think twice
before messing with me.

82
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,700
''Love was ...''

83
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:01,500
What was love?

84
00:09:01,700 --> 00:09:05,700
''Love was ...''

85
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,500
Now I'm really pissed!

86
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:17,100
Don't touch!

87
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:22,100
Shut up! You don't intimidate me
with your attitude.

88
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:26,100
I grew up in hell, homeboy.
My grandmother had more attitude.

89
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:33,200
Police! Doughnut-munching morons!
Help me!

90
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Assault! And you're black!

91
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,000
I like Simon enough
to batter you unrecognizable, -

92
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:46,900
- if you verbally abuse him
or touch that dog again.

93
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:55,600
Meantime ... I'll think of some way
that you can make it up to him.

94
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:01,000
I hate doing this!
I'm an art dealer.

95
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:03,300
Have a nice day.

96
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,700
Party!

97
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:29,500
- Don't touch.
- Get a life.

98
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,700
Watch it.

99
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,700
- Look at you. You're better.
- New medication.

100
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:48,300
You know all my son's stuff?
I've got a date tonight.

101
00:10:48,400 --> 00:10:53,100
I'm walking out the door, he says,
''I promise not to get a cough.''

102
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:57,200
- lsn't that sweet?
- A little blond angel.

103
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:03,400
I said, ''You love me the way
you love your remote control.''

104
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:05,700
That's great.

105
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,000
People that talk in metaphors
ought to shampoo my crotch.

106
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:14,400
- Eat up!
- I've got your money.

107
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:18,600
- Pay me next week.
- I owe you and I told you today.

108
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:20,800
Excuse me, Melvin.

109
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:26,600
There you go.

110
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:34,700
Pardon me.
Take the money.

111
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:40,900
- Take a cab home and get ready.
- Ready is not my problem.

112
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,300
- I'm starving.
- You're not allowed back here.

113
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:52,000
Spence is more excited about it
than I am.

114
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:55,900
Sometimes, these kids,
you just want to ...

115
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,100
- I've got jews at my table.
- It's not your table.

116
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:03,300
You can sit
at someone else's station.

117
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,100
Or you can wait your turn.

118
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:19,500
How much more have you got to eat?

119
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:27,000
Appetites aren't as big
as your noses, huh?

120
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:29,900
That's it!

121
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:32,400
Let's go.

122
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:37,300
He's barred for life.

123
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:50,900
- They left.
- Yeah, what do you know?

124
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:58,400
Bryan says, if you ever act like
this again you are barred for life.

125
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,600
I'm going to miss the excitement.

126
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,400
Three eggs, over easy.

127
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,700
- Sausage, bacon, fries.
- Fries today?

128
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:14,100
A short stack.
Coffee with cream and sweetener.

129
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:17,300
You'll die soon, with that diet.

130
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:23,200
We're all gonna die. You and I are,
and it sounds like your son will.

131
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:43,600
If you ever mention my son again ...

132
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:48,900
... you will never be able to eat
here again. Do you understand?

133
00:13:54,500 --> 00:14:00,300
Give me some sign you understand,
or leave now.

134
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:06,400
Do you understand me,
you crazy fuck?

135
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:14,000
Do you?

136
00:14:20,500 --> 00:14:22,600
Yes ...

137
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:33,700
I'll get your order.

138
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:37,000
Wear my earrings tonight.

139
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:44,500
It's just so interesting.
You said it like it was nothing.

140
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:55,000
- Where's the bedroom?
- This is sort of it ...

141
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:58,600
I sort of sleep in here.

142
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:10,200
Don't worry about it.

143
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:36,400
What?

144
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,300
I don't know.

145
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:49,900
Grandma ...

146
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:55,800
- Maybe you better check.
- What did you think I was going to?

147
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:03,500
I'm sorry.
I was hearing everything ...

148
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,600
I put these on to give you privacy.

149
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,400
How was dinner?

150
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:17,200
- How was your friend?
- Are you okay? Scootch over.

151
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,500
- Where did he take you to eat?
- A nice place.

152
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:26,600
I have him ...

153
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:30,500
- One more spit?
- He's waiting.

154
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:33,300
Go.

155
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:37,200
- Give me a hug.
- Carol.

156
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:42,500
- Carol, I have him.
- She has me. Go.

157
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:50,300
Close the curtains.

158
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:57,500
No! He can't take smoke.

159
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
Magic.

160
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:15,800
God! That'll teach you.
I don't even notice it any more.

161
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,900
Come here.

162
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,200
- It's a little bit of throw-up.
- ''Little bit of throw-up''?

163
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,700
What shall we do?

164
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:43,600
Shall I write down which train
you take, or should we lay ...

165
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:46,700
No. I'll take a cab.

166
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,900
It's just a little too much reality
for a Friday night.

167
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:04,900
I promised Simon
I'd find him a model.

168
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:09,300
Take me offthe speaker.
These are house seats.

169
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:16,400
Come on. You could use a break.
Hello? Carl? You there?

170
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:20,000
Okay. I just found a model.

171
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,800
- Hey, boys!
- I know this guy.

172
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,200
What's going on?

173
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:37,400
- Hi. Remember?
- I only need one.

174
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:40,800
You picked me up some time ago.

175
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:45,000
- This is for a portrait.
- Portrait?

176
00:18:46,200 --> 00:18:49,800
Come here.
I'll give you the address.

177
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:54,300
- Brad Pitt. It's the shit.
- Do you read?

178
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:02,100
Who is it, baby?

179
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:08,100
Who is it, Verdell?

180
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:13,600
I'm sorry. I told you today.

181
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,700
I was out in the studio and I ...

182
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,800
It's out here.

183
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:23,400
- You have great things.
- Gershwin. Great, isn't he?

184
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:28,100
I make a big deal about picking
models, but Carl is so thorough.

185
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:31,700
I bet he drove you nuts
checking your rsum.

186
00:19:35,300 --> 00:19:38,300
This is not a nude.

187
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:41,700
Just kidding around.

188
00:19:42,800 --> 00:19:44,800
So much for love.

189
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:48,600
And yet another pose.

190
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:55,200
- What is your previous experience?
- I'm running out of ideas here.

191
00:19:57,800 --> 00:20:02,500
- Give me some direction.
- I just watch.

192
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:07,800
Until something strikes me.
Do anything you think of.

193
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:13,500
Wait until I say to hold that pose,
then just try to hold it.

194
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:17,300
No direction.

195
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:23,700
What I do is, I watch.

196
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:28,800
Ever watch somebody who doesn't
know you're watching them?

197
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:33,600
An old woman sitting on a bus?
Or kids going to school?

198
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:39,200
Somebody just waiting, and you see
this flash come over them.

199
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:44,900
And you know it has nothing to do
with anything external.

200
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:50,000
They're just sort of realer
and more alive.

201
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:55,700
You look at someone long enough,
you discover their humanity.

202
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,600
I know exactly what you mean.

203
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:12,400
Oh, my God ... Hold it.

204
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,800
Look out.

205
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,900
Excuse me.

206
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:24,200
I got on the third line of dialogue.

207
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:27,300
And all of a sudden I blanked.

208
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:29,500
Clippity-clop. lgnores me.

209
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,100
- So he said to me, ''Last chance.''
- Last chance.

210
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:37,500
- I came back in.
- Here she comes to ignore me again.

211
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,000
I messed up the same line.
But guess what?

212
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,900
He cast me!

213
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:50,100
Just what the world needs.
Another actress.

214
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:59,500
Can't live without me?

215
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:06,800
I'm finally going to ask.
What's with the plastic picnicware?

216
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:11,000
Are you afraid ours isn't clean?

217
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:16,500
- It's a judgment call.
- Give yourself a pep talk.

218
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:21,900
''Must try other people's
clean silverware when dining out.''

219
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:29,000
- What's wrong with your son?
- What do you care?

220
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,600
He fights to breathe.
His asthma can shoot off the charts.

221
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:47,800
His immune system fails when there's
trouble, so an ear infection ...

222
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:53,200
- ls this bothering you?
- No.

223
00:22:55,000 --> 00:22:59,000
An ear infection, anything,
sends him to the emergency room, -

224
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,100
- where I get some nine-year-old
they just made a doctor.

225
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:05,600
Nice chatting.

226
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:10,500
- His name?
- Spencer.

227
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,900
Spence.

228
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,100
It's okay. Go on.

229
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:38,200
Put on anything you want.

230
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:42,900
- I might be sort of done here.
- All we do is work. Let's play!

231
00:23:57,900 --> 00:24:04,600
- So you're practically finished?
- Yeah. There is one more stage.

232
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:15,200
- Where are you going?
- No place. Just to sneak a peek.

233
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:31,300
- Verdell, you want some chocolate?
- He's not allowed.

234
00:24:31,500 --> 00:24:36,200
Wait! I got to take off.
Do you want to say goodbye?

235
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:40,100
- Yeah. He's just got to go.
- Wait.

236
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,600
I'm going to look at the painting.

237
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:48,900
Where are you going?

238
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:55,200
Want some water?
What's the matter?

239
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,500
You want some water?

240
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:03,600
Simon, wait!

241
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:19,400
Why are you doing this?

242
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,600
No, wait ...

243
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:27,200
- That painting in there ...
- Are you cruising him?

244
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,000
Excuse me ...

245
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:42,000
- Help me!
- Come on!

246
00:25:43,700 --> 00:25:45,700
Come on.

247
00:25:57,500 --> 00:26:01,600
You call 91 1
and don't leave your name?

248
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:06,600
- Even a dumb geezer knows ...
- Just move on. No one was killed.

249
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:08,900
Ask him.

250
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:13,400
Don't bark at me.
I didn't name you.

251
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:17,600
We will. And if he can't,
we'll come back and ask you.

252
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:24,700
Hey. I come from hell. My grandma
has got more attitude than you.

253
00:26:24,900 --> 00:26:28,500
Go shake down a 7-1 1
for a day-old wiener.

254
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:33,200
There's a painting
of one of the guys.

255
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:41,500
- I've been praying for him.
- I'm on my way to the hospital.

256
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:45,900
- Just watch the dog for tonight.
- No, no.

257
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,900
- I'm sorry.
- Thanks.

258
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:54,800
Old bitch. Damn dog.

259
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,800
You're taking him!

260
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:03,200
Get out of the way!

261
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,400
Even the books.

262
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:09,200
Wait!

263
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,500
Do you want to say no to me?

264
00:27:18,800 --> 00:27:22,300
I don't want to say nothing to you.

265
00:27:22,800 --> 00:27:29,300
Because I've never felt this crazy.
I almost want you to say no.

266
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:34,700
Thanks for looking after him.

267
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:41,900
- Hey! Where are you going?
- You don't want to mess with me.

268
00:27:42,100 --> 00:27:47,100
I can't take a dog.
Nobody's been in here before.

269
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,300
Hey, Frank.

270
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:20,100
One, two, three, four ...

271
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:42,600
You're dead.

272
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:46,600
We don't have no dog food here.

273
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:51,300
You'll eat what we got.
What we eat.

274
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,900
Don't you do anything!

275
00:29:17,700 --> 00:29:20,200
Where's the trust?

276
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:33,000
Never a break.

277
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,800
God!

278
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:11,700
We're halfway through the show
and we haven't sold a painting.

279
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:15,200
No, we can't reduce the price.

280
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:20,500
- I'm in a free fall here.
- We can see him.

281
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:25,100
I'll meet you in there, okay?

282
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:29,200
Thank you.

283
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,400
- How are you doing, great one?
- I haven't looked at myself yet.

284
00:30:36,600 --> 00:30:41,200
I figured
I could tell from your reaction.

285
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:46,000
- That bad?
- I talked to the doctor and ...

286
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:55,900
It's not that bad. The doctors say
you'll be your old self again.

287
00:30:56,100 --> 00:31:00,600
The scars might ... Oh, shit!

288
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,400
Jackie ...

289
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,700
Hand me a mirror, please.

290
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:23,200
Wait. I have a smaller one.

291
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:36,500
So how are things, anyway?

292
00:31:36,700 --> 00:31:42,300
- How is Verdell?
- Mr. Udall ... taking care of him.

293
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:48,200
- How could you? He'll hurt him.
- No, I promise.

294
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:53,200
Not a chance. I own this guy.
Besides, there was nobody else.

295
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,300
I'm always on the move and ...

296
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:59,300
Trust me.

297
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:04,200
- You are certain my dog is okay?
- Yes, your dog is fine.

298
00:32:11,100 --> 00:32:14,500
Waiting gives the devil time.

299
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:33,900
Oh, my!

300
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:46,600
Where did I go?

301
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:50,900
- That's your dog?
- No.

302
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:55,000
What are you doing with a dog?

303
00:32:55,300 --> 00:33:00,100
- Suckered in, set up.
- You're not worried he'll be taken?

304
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:06,300
No, not until now.

305
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:10,400
- Sorry.
- I'm going to sit here.

306
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:13,000
Hey, puppy.

307
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:17,200
It's so cute.

308
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:20,400
I wonder what breed he is.

309
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:28,800
He's a little dog. If Bryan's not
here, you can bring him in.

310
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:34,100
How old are you?

311
00:33:34,300 --> 00:33:37,800
To guess by your eyes ... 50.

312
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:42,600
By your eyes, I'd say you were kind.
So much for eyes.

313
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:47,100
How old are you?
You brought it up. I'm curious.

314
00:33:47,300 --> 00:33:52,200
- Not that you're ugly.
- I can take the compliment.

315
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:57,000
But my knees start knocking when
you turn on the charm full blast.

316
00:33:57,200 --> 00:34:00,800
What's with the dark?

317
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,400
Dawn patrol.

318
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:09,400
My son had
a full-blown attack.

319
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:14,900
And for extra fun
they gave us the wrong antibiotics.

320
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:17,900
No!

321
00:34:18,100 --> 00:34:22,200
It's bacon for the dog.

322
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,300
Last week I was playing the piano
for him. And he likes it.

323
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:34,900
So I decide
I'm going to make a little joke.

324
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:48,100
It's a beautiful day for our walk.

325
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:03,700
Look at that dog.

326
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:08,900
I've got to give you
something real good.

327
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:13,200
I'm going to show it to you.

328
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:17,400
Don't be like me.

329
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:23,300
Stay as you are. You're perfect.
I'll get you something to eat.

330
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:28,500
I'd like to be treated like that.

331
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:34,200
Let's go home and do some writing.

332
00:35:35,500 --> 00:35:40,200
''He had made the girl happy.
And what a girl.''

333
00:35:40,600 --> 00:35:44,100
''You've saved my life, she said.''

334
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:49,100
''You'd better make it up to me.''

335
00:35:51,900 --> 00:35:57,900
Done!
Yes, I hate the doggie.

336
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:02,400
62 books. Done.

337
00:36:03,100 --> 00:36:08,600
- We have to cut back all expenses.
- He has no medical insurance?

338
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:13,800
These are the food receipts,
the household expenses.

339
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:17,800
- Here's one for the dog again.
- I got it.

340
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,000
And all the laundry.

341
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:30,000
Boy, look at that.
He likes it at Chez Melvin.

342
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:35,900
What are you coming over here for?
I can't cook with a dog near me.

343
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:42,500
Just sit. We don't want any company.
I'll read you Emerson.

344
00:36:54,100 --> 00:37:00,000
- How's Verdell doing?
- He's a pain in the ass.

345
00:37:03,800 --> 00:37:10,400
Simon's home. Can you keep the dog
until he's had a chance to adjust?

346
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:15,200
It's been weeks and weeks.
A few more won't matter.

347
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:20,900
He wants him back right away.
He'll be by tomorrow.

348
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:26,500
Okay.

349
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,300
Hungry? Be right with you.

350
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,700
Mr. Udall.

351
00:38:46,200 --> 00:38:50,600
Some face they left hanging on you.
You look like ...

352
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:54,600
Could you take it ...

353
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:58,800
... just a little easy, Mr. Udall?

354
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
Thank you.

355
00:39:06,700 --> 00:39:09,100
Verdell.

356
00:39:10,500 --> 00:39:14,700
Come here, my beautiful boy.
Come here.

357
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,300
Let's go home and get well.

358
00:39:19,400 --> 00:39:24,400
I can't blame him for being weird.
Look at yourself in the mirror.

359
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:31,100
Thank you.

360
00:39:34,300 --> 00:39:37,300
Come on, sweetheart.

361
00:39:37,500 --> 00:39:40,800
Verdell, come here.

362
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:46,000
I know what you want.

363
00:39:49,600 --> 00:39:52,200
Where's my boy?

364
00:39:57,600 --> 00:40:01,400
No, don't force him.

365
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:37,600
Over a dog!

366
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:41,800
Over an ugly dog.

367
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:53,700
Worst sidewalk in New York.
Look where they put it.

368
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:05,200
- Help!
- You'll make an appointment.

369
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:09,300
How can you diagnose someone as
an obsessive-compulsive disorder -

370
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:12,500
- and then act like I had a choice
about barging in?

371
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:16,100
- You must leave.
- You said you could help me.

372
00:41:16,300 --> 00:41:21,700
- What was that? A tease?
- If you take responsibility ...

373
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:25,900
- You changed the room around.
- Two years ago.

374
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,100
I also grew a beard, but you're
not interested in changes in me.

375
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:34,200
I don't have a mountain of time.
I have to get to my restaurant.

376
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:38,700
Do you know how hard it was for me
to come here?

377
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,500
No, we're not doing this now.

378
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,800
I changed just one pattern,
as you always said I should.

379
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,400
No. Nope.

380
00:41:59,600 --> 00:42:04,400
What if this is
as good as it gets?

381
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:19,400
What the heck are those for?

382
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,500
No, no, no. Get Carol.

383
00:42:24,600 --> 00:42:30,500
I'm filling in. She might be getting
a job closer to home.

384
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,100
- Why plastic?
- What are you trying to do to me?

385
00:42:37,300 --> 00:42:41,400
- What do you mean?
- Look, elephant girl.

386
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:47,200
Go get Carol or something.
Just have her do my one meal here.

387
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:50,400
I'll pay whatever you want.

388
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:55,100
Do it!

389
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:01,200
Bryan. Code blue.

390
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:10,900
Out! Just shut up and get out.

391
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:17,800
I'll be quiet.
Just let me stay here. No problem.

392
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:22,300
Go get Carol.

393
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:28,000
I'm not a prick.
You are. I'm not judging.

394
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:33,300
This day has been a disaster.

395
00:43:34,100 --> 00:43:37,900
- I'm not sure if I can handle this.
- Get out!

396
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:45,400
Get out immediately
or there's going to be trouble.

397
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:02,700
See you.

398
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,100
It's about time.

399
00:44:08,000 --> 00:44:13,500
- Carol's last name?
- Connelly.

400
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:25,000
- Does he visit often?
- Not really. Not any more.

401
00:45:15,500 --> 00:45:18,300
I'm hungry.

402
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,800
You've ruined my whole day.
I haven't eaten.

403
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:26,100
- What are you doing here?
- This is not a sexist thing ...

404
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:29,600
Are you totally gone?
This is my home.

405
00:45:31,800 --> 00:45:37,400
I'm trying to keep emotion aside,
even though it's important.

406
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:42,600
- I have strong feelings on this.
- What?

407
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:48,700
That I wasn't there? Do you have
any control over how creepy you get?

408
00:45:54,500 --> 00:45:58,300
Yes, I do.

409
00:45:59,100 --> 00:46:04,900
And to prove it ... I have not
gotten personal, and you have.

410
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:10,000
Why aren't you at work?
Are you sick?

411
00:46:12,100 --> 00:46:15,500
You don't look sick.

412
00:46:16,100 --> 00:46:19,800
Just tired and bitter.

413
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:25,000
My son is sick.

414
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,400
What about your mother?

415
00:46:30,900 --> 00:46:36,500
- How do you know about her?
- I hear you talking while I wait.

416
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:40,700
- Mom, I finished my juice.
- One sec.

417
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:52,100
How are you doing?

418
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:00,100
You should answer me.

419
00:47:00,300 --> 00:47:05,100
Sorry, Melvin. I can't handle you
teaching my son manners.

420
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,500
Back to life.

421
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,800
What's wrong?

422
00:47:20,900 --> 00:47:27,200
Five one-thousand,
four one-thousand ...

423
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:34,000
- 104.9.
- We're going on a cab ride.

424
00:47:36,100 --> 00:47:39,400
Look out, you guys!

425
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:44,900
Look out.
We're okay. We're okay.

426
00:47:46,600 --> 00:47:49,200
Melvin! Wait!

427
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,200
Melvin! Wait!

428
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,100
Shut up, kids!

429
00:48:02,700 --> 00:48:05,800
Give us a lift, would you?

430
00:48:09,900 --> 00:48:13,300
Cover your mouth when you cough.

431
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:20,600
- Brooklyn Presbyterian Hospital.
- Hospital?

432
00:48:21,100 --> 00:48:26,400
- Any chance you'll be back today?
- No! Stay away from me.

433
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:36,700
We can't put this off any longer.
I feel terrible that I have to ...

434
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:41,500
Could you just leave the dog
for a second?

435
00:48:43,300 --> 00:48:46,100
Sorry.

436
00:48:48,900 --> 00:48:54,000
- What are those cards?
- Frank thought I should have notes.

437
00:48:55,000 --> 00:49:00,000
So I would maintain focus
and not terrify you.

438
00:49:00,200 --> 00:49:05,500
See? He's right.
I need the cards.

439
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:07,400
SlMON, YOU'RE BROKE

440
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:19,100
The medical bills are 61,000 now.
And the show didn't go well.

441
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:24,200
I spoke to your parents.
They didn't hang up or anything.

442
00:49:24,400 --> 00:49:28,300
But they'd feel strange calling you.

443
00:49:28,500 --> 00:49:33,100
I can't call them. Come here, baby.

444
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,300
Come here.

445
00:49:36,500 --> 00:49:40,400
Verdell? What's wrong?

446
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,100
You miss the tough guy?
Well, here I am.

447
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:50,300
Happy to see me, you little mop?
How about a ride down the chute?

448
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:53,200
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

449
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:56,100
I didn't mean that, sweetheart.

450
00:49:56,200 --> 00:49:57,900
Sorry ...

451
00:49:59,400 --> 00:50:04,800
I'll be able to keep my apartment
and the studio, won't I?

452
00:50:07,400 --> 00:50:11,400
Oh, my God!

453
00:50:41,300 --> 00:50:45,700
Yes, you make us a lot of money.
But it's more appropriate ...

454
00:50:45,800 --> 00:50:52,700
I need this.
Just say, ''Melvin, I'll try.''

455
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:59,400
- Melvin, I'll try.
- Thank you.

456
00:50:59,600 --> 00:51:06,000
My son just got accepted to Brown.
My husband was dying.

457
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:12,000
Good, nice, thrilled, exciting.
You don't have to wait with me.

458
00:51:19,800 --> 00:51:27,300
I can't resist. I just have
so many questions I want to ask you.

459
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:31,700
You have no idea
what your work means to me.

460
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:34,500
What does it mean to you?

461
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:39,400
That somebody out there knows
what it's like to be in here.

462
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:43,100
God, this is like a nightmare.

463
00:51:43,800 --> 00:51:47,900
Come on.
Just a couple of questions.

464
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:55,500
- How do you write women so well?
- I think of a man.

465
00:51:55,700 --> 00:52:00,300
And I take away reason
and accountability.

466
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,100
- Mom!
- ln here, Mrs. Connelly.

467
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:37,500
- Please, what?
- I'm ...

468
00:52:37,700 --> 00:52:40,300
- Tell me!
- Dr. Bettes.

469
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:45,400
- Not your name. Where is he?
- He's in the bathroom.

470
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:50,500
What's wrong? You know there are
doctors that come to your house?

471
00:52:50,600 --> 00:52:53,400
I'm home.

472
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:57,900
I didn't know you had an admirer.
Oh, you met the gift.

473
00:52:59,100 --> 00:53:02,300
He's good. I'm an expert on doctors.

474
00:53:02,500 --> 00:53:05,500
Okay, doctor?

475
00:53:05,700 --> 00:53:09,400
My wife is
Melvin Udall's publisher.

476
00:53:09,600 --> 00:53:14,900
I'm to take care of this little guy
because you are needed at work.

477
00:53:15,100 --> 00:53:19,400
- What kind of work do you do?
- I'm a waitress.

478
00:53:19,700 --> 00:53:23,600
- ln Manhattan.
- Dr. Bettes?

479
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:26,300
Excuse me.

480
00:53:27,800 --> 00:53:32,100
- I'm sorry it took so long.
- I couldn't find it, either.

481
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:38,700
Could you get this to the lab?
I want it back today.

482
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:45,100
- Did you say ''today''?
- Yes. Let's sit down.

483
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:51,500
These are the receipts from
all the prescriptions for the year.

484
00:53:51,700 --> 00:53:57,400
- The calendar.
- This is a calendar of days.

485
00:53:57,500 --> 00:54:00,700
- And how he felt.
- Good.

486
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:05,500
- How long has he had the problem?
- Since forever. Six months old.

487
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:08,400
Have they done blood tests?

488
00:54:08,600 --> 00:54:12,400
- When he was well?
- No.

489
00:54:12,500 --> 00:54:15,800
- And how about skin testing?
- No.

490
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:19,000
- No standard scratch test?
- No.

491
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:24,800
They said my plan didn't cover it.
Why? Should they have?

492
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:29,300
Fucking HMO bastard pieces of shit!

493
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:35,000
- I'm sorry.
- That's their technical name.

494
00:54:37,200 --> 00:54:43,500
Once the tests come back,
is there someone we should talk to?

495
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:47,400
Me.
My home number is on the card.

496
00:54:48,600 --> 00:54:51,500
His home number.

497
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:59,900
- What?
- Your home ...

498
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:09,200
- Can we get you anything else?
- No, thank you.

499
00:55:09,400 --> 00:55:13,300
Couple of female slaves?

500
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:18,200
There's still a lot of tests
I need to do.

501
00:55:18,400 --> 00:55:22,200
Whatever I find out,
I promise you, -

502
00:55:22,300 --> 00:55:27,300
- from now on your son is going
to feel a great deal better.

503
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:38,000
Doc!

504
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:46,600
That's good.

505
00:55:51,900 --> 00:55:55,900
Let me know about the costs.
One way or another we'll ...

506
00:55:56,200 --> 00:56:00,200
The costs
are going to be considerable.

507
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:05,300
But Mr. Udall wants to be billed.

508
00:56:08,200 --> 00:56:10,900
That's wonderful.

509
00:56:14,200 --> 00:56:17,700
Thank you for everything, Nora.

510
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:23,300
Forgive my crankiness. I'll call
when things get back on track.

511
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:36,300
- What's wrong?
- Who's going to walk Verdell?

512
00:56:38,300 --> 00:56:40,300
No!

513
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:59,200
- ls he dead yet?
- No.

514
00:57:00,000 --> 00:57:06,200
Would there be any way you would
be willing to walk his dog for him?

515
00:57:06,500 --> 00:57:12,800
- Absolutely.
- You're a wonderful man.

516
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:20,200
Two o'clock would be a good time.
Here is the key in case he's asleep.

517
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:26,800
Open his curtains for him
so he can see God's beautiful work.

518
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:31,900
And he'll know that even things
like this happen for the best.

519
00:57:32,100 --> 00:57:36,700
Did you learn to talk like this in
a ''Sailor, wanna hump-hump''-bar?

520
00:57:36,900 --> 00:57:40,100
Or is this your last shot
at his whisky?

521
00:57:40,300 --> 00:57:44,700
Sell crazy someplace else.
We're all stocked up here.

522
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:58,700
No! A goofy man is behind this.
You can't block out that man.

523
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:04,200
Do you really want to go back to
emergency, where they can't help?

524
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:09,600
This lets a crazy man
into our lives.

525
00:58:12,300 --> 00:58:15,600
You know how this will turn out.

526
00:58:15,800 --> 00:58:20,900
This is not like a string of pearls.
You don't send this one back.

527
00:58:25,600 --> 00:58:27,900
Right?

528
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:38,000
No. I do, I understand.
Listen. I have to go, okay?

529
00:58:38,900 --> 00:58:42,800
FRlENDS TO ASK FOR MONEY

530
00:58:43,500 --> 00:58:45,600
Bye.

531
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,200
Bye-bye.

532
00:58:52,100 --> 00:58:54,400
What a day ...

533
00:58:54,700 --> 00:58:57,800
Maybe I'll bring him some food by.

534
00:58:58,000 --> 00:59:00,700
Thank you for walking him.

535
00:59:02,700 --> 00:59:08,100
- Excuse me, I'm not feeling well.
- This place smells like shit.

536
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,500
Go away.

537
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:16,100
- This cleaning lady doesn't ..?
- Please, just leave.

538
00:59:17,700 --> 00:59:22,600
- What happened to your friends?
- Get out of here!

539
00:59:28,000 --> 00:59:31,400
There's nothing worse than having
to feel this way in front of you.

540
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:37,700
Nellie.
Your a disgrace to depression.

541
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:44,700
- Rot in hell, Melvin.
- No need to stop being a lady.

542
00:59:44,900 --> 00:59:48,000
You'll be back on your knees
in no time.

543
00:59:56,800 --> 01:00:00,000
ls this fun for you?

544
01:00:00,500 --> 01:00:06,600
It keeps getting better and better.
I'm losing my apartment, Melvin.

545
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:11,700
Frank wants me to beg my parents,
who haven't called me, for help.

546
01:00:12,500 --> 01:00:14,400
And I won't.

547
01:00:14,600 --> 01:00:17,900
I don't want to paint any more.

548
01:00:18,200 --> 01:00:21,500
The life I was trying for, is over.

549
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:27,500
The life I had is gone
and I'm feeling sorry for myself.

550
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:33,500
It's high times for you, isn't it?
The gay neighbour is terrified.

551
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:36,600
Terrified!

552
01:00:48,300 --> 01:00:52,300
I was trying to give you a boost.

553
01:00:52,400 --> 01:00:57,200
Lucky you.
You're here for rock bottom.

554
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:01,700
You absolute horror
of a human being.

555
01:01:14,400 --> 01:01:19,400
The one thing I'll do for you
might cheer you up.

556
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:22,100
Get out.

557
01:01:22,400 --> 01:01:26,400
You want to know why the dog
prefers me? It's not affection.

558
01:01:26,600 --> 01:01:29,200
It's a trick.

559
01:01:31,200 --> 01:01:34,500
I keep bacon in my pocket.

560
01:01:35,100 --> 01:01:37,300
See?

561
01:01:43,000 --> 01:01:48,900
We'll both call him. You'll see.
It's a trick.

562
01:01:57,300 --> 01:02:00,600
Come here, Verdell.

563
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:08,000
Come on.

564
01:02:08,400 --> 01:02:10,400
Come here.

565
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:19,500
Just a stupid dog.

566
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:26,800
Could you leave now? Please?

567
01:02:28,900 --> 01:02:32,500
I don't get it.

568
01:04:08,800 --> 01:04:10,800
Mr. Udall!

569
01:04:12,600 --> 01:04:16,100
- Carol the waitress?
- Yes.

570
01:04:25,900 --> 01:04:30,500
The doctors gave me your address.
I'm sorry about the hour.

571
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:39,200
If you ...

572
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:48,800
- If it's about thanking me ...
- That's not why I'm here.

573
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:54,200
Though it's nice to talk to
a real doctor about Spencer.

574
01:04:56,900 --> 01:05:01,000
Note. Put it in a note.

575
01:05:09,600 --> 01:05:15,000
- I have a hairdryer.
- Why did you do this for me?

576
01:05:19,200 --> 01:05:24,400
- So you'd come back to work.
- That sounds strange.

577
01:05:27,700 --> 01:05:31,300
I'm worried you did this ...

578
01:05:46,400 --> 01:05:51,400
Are you waiting for me
to say something?

579
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:56,300
Look ...

580
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:03,500
- I'll be there tomorrow.
- I need to clear this up now.

581
01:06:05,000 --> 01:06:07,800
Clear what up?

582
01:06:09,100 --> 01:06:14,400
I'm not going to sleep with you.
I will never sleep with you.

583
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:17,900
Not ever!

584
01:06:22,400 --> 01:06:26,800
I'm sorry, but ...

585
01:06:28,700 --> 01:06:34,200
... we don't open
for the no-sex oaths until 9 a.m.

586
01:06:35,100 --> 01:06:41,200
- I'm not kidding.
- Anything else?

587
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:47,700
Just ... thank you.

588
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:56,300
So you will be at work tomorrow?

589
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:01,300
Yes.

590
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:19,500
''Never'', she said.

591
01:07:37,400 --> 01:07:41,300
I took a chance you were up.

592
01:07:41,600 --> 01:07:44,900
I brought you some Chinese soup.

593
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,300
Thanks.

594
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:09,500
I've never been this tired
in my life.

595
01:08:16,300 --> 01:08:19,800
I haven't been sleeping.

596
01:08:21,100 --> 01:08:26,400
I haven't been clear in my head
or felt like myself.

597
01:08:29,300 --> 01:08:31,900
I'm in trouble.

598
01:08:32,400 --> 01:08:35,200
It's not just the tiredness.

599
01:08:35,700 --> 01:08:40,900
- Sick. Nauseous.
- Sleepy.

600
01:08:41,100 --> 01:08:47,300
Everything looks distorted
and everything inside aches.

601
01:08:47,500 --> 01:08:51,300
You can barely find the will
to complain.

602
01:08:55,400 --> 01:08:59,000
I'm glad we did this.

603
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:02,900
Good talking to you.

604
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:16,900
- Still writing that thank-you note?
- How do you spell ''conscience''?

605
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:20,500
C-O-N-S-C-I-E-N-C-E.

606
01:09:20,600 --> 01:09:25,900
Look, I got Sean to babysit
so we could go out.

607
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:29,900
I don't feel safe
leaving Spencer with someone.

608
01:09:30,000 --> 01:09:35,200
Spencer's okay. Start finding
something to do with your free time.

609
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:39,800
Sean, are you hungry?

610
01:09:40,800 --> 01:09:47,100
We got pizza. Sausage, pepperoni.
You want to make this later?

611
01:09:48,800 --> 01:09:52,400
We are going out, like people do.

612
01:09:54,400 --> 01:10:00,700
If you can't feel good about
this break and step out a little, -

613
01:10:00,900 --> 01:10:06,000
- then you ought to have Mr. Udall
send you over a psychiatrist.

614
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:09,500
I don't need one.
I know what's going on here.

615
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:18,300
I must finish this letter first.
This can't be right? Con-science?

616
01:10:19,000 --> 01:10:21,300
Carol!

617
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:28,500
What?

618
01:10:43,500 --> 01:10:46,600
It's very weird not feeling that ...

619
01:10:47,300 --> 01:10:51,600
... stupid panic thing inside me.

620
01:10:52,300 --> 01:10:56,100
Without that,
I start thinking about myself.

621
01:10:56,300 --> 01:10:59,800
And what good
does that ever get anybody?

622
01:11:02,500 --> 01:11:06,000
Today on the bus
there was this adorable couple.

623
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,000
And I felt myself ...

624
01:11:10,300 --> 01:11:13,900
... giving them a dirty look.

625
01:11:14,400 --> 01:11:20,500
I just had no idea.
Everything was ...

626
01:11:27,400 --> 01:11:30,100
Go ahead.

627
01:11:31,300 --> 01:11:34,700
Moving in the wrong direction.

628
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:41,800
Away from a time when I remembered
what it was like to have a man ...

629
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:44,300
... to hold fucking ...

630
01:11:48,600 --> 01:11:52,400
... hands with.

631
01:11:54,100 --> 01:12:00,400
I felt almost really bad
that Dr. Bettes is married.

632
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:09,000
Which is probably why I make Spence
hug me more than he wants to.

633
01:12:10,900 --> 01:12:15,900
He has to make up for
his Mom not getting any.

634
01:12:20,200 --> 01:12:26,000
- Who needs these thoughts?
- So, are you frustrated?

635
01:12:26,100 --> 01:12:31,200
Leave me be.
What is it you want?

636
01:12:31,400 --> 01:12:37,700
Does getting me thinking about all
that's wrong have some purpose?

637
01:12:39,100 --> 01:12:42,900
Really, Mom, what is it you want?

638
01:12:43,200 --> 01:12:47,700
- What?
- I want us to go out.

639
01:13:17,000 --> 01:13:22,000
- Thank you.
- I'll send you a thank-you note.

640
01:13:28,700 --> 01:13:28,900
That's why you brought me here?

641
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:31,400
That's why you brought me here?

642
01:13:31,500 --> 01:13:37,200
Well, it's not even mine.
Simon has enough on his mind.

643
01:13:37,300 --> 01:13:41,300
But the dog did throw up
twice last night.

644
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:46,900
- Take him to the vet.
- I did. His stomach's out of whack.

645
01:13:47,100 --> 01:13:50,300
- They need him a couple of days.
- Well, do it ...

646
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,600
Sorry.

647
01:13:53,900 --> 01:13:58,700
- This is for later.
- What's this?

648
01:13:59,800 --> 01:14:03,700
- It's a note.
- A note?

649
01:14:03,900 --> 01:14:07,400
- A thank-you note.
- No thank you.

650
01:14:07,500 --> 01:14:12,300
- You can read it later.
- No thank-you note. No, no.

651
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:18,300
Thank you.

652
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:30,600
- She's nice.
- Yeah, really nice.

653
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:37,900
Shouldn't that be a good thing,
saying, ''No thanks required''?

654
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,500
Sure looks like it went over, too.

655
01:14:44,700 --> 01:14:48,200
Look at you.

656
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:53,700
You're making the rounds.
Simon says you brought him soup.

657
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:01,500
- What?
- You think I'm a mark ...

658
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:06,700
You helped with the dog. I'm as
concerned about Simon as you are.

659
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:09,900
- Concerned?
- He needs more than money.

660
01:15:10,100 --> 01:15:14,900
He must go to Baltimore to ask
his parents for money tomorrow.

661
01:15:15,100 --> 01:15:18,900
They have to help. It's the rules.

662
01:15:19,100 --> 01:15:22,800
That's great. Let them help him.

663
01:15:24,600 --> 01:15:26,700
Only ...

664
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:32,200
... I got a painter coming through,
so I'm out.

665
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,900
- Can you drive him?
- Think white and get serious!

666
01:15:39,900 --> 01:15:43,000
Take my car? A convertible.

667
01:15:44,500 --> 01:15:48,400
- Do you drive?
- Yes. But I'm not doing it.

668
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:51,400
Getting loud.

669
01:15:53,000 --> 01:15:58,200
- He wants me to take his car ...
- I want your problems.

670
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:03,000
Somebody offers me a convertible
so I can get out of this city ...

671
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:13,600
- Go ahead, girl.
- Okay. I'll do it.

672
01:16:13,800 --> 01:16:19,300
I'll take him. Get him packed.
Tomorrow morning I'll take him.

673
01:16:24,200 --> 01:16:29,600
I'll see you tomorrow.
Let's not drag this out.

674
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,900
If there's some health foundation
for people like you, let me know.

675
01:16:40,700 --> 01:16:45,300
- Last-word freak.
- Good luck, lady.

676
01:16:46,500 --> 01:16:49,900
- Anything else?
- Yeah.

677
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:56,500
I'm going to give my queer neighbour
a lift to Baltimore.

678
01:17:00,300 --> 01:17:05,500
What I did for you ...
It's working out?

679
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:11,700
What you did changed my life.

680
01:17:12,600 --> 01:17:14,800
No!

681
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:17,800
No thank-you note.

682
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:23,400
Well, part of what I said in this
entire history of my life -

683
01:17:23,700 --> 01:17:29,000
- is that you have done more
for my mother, my son ...

684
01:17:29,200 --> 01:17:32,900
... and me
than anybody else ever has.

685
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:36,600
I'm just going to read you
this part of it

686
01:17:37,500 --> 01:17:43,400
''That makes you the most generous
person I ever met in my life.''

687
01:17:43,600 --> 01:17:48,200
''And you're going to be
in our daily prayers, forever.''

688
01:17:49,600 --> 01:17:51,700
Lovely.

689
01:17:52,900 --> 01:17:57,300
I also wrote one part ...
I wrote that I was sorry.

690
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:03,700
I was talking about how I was sorry
when I got mad at you -

691
01:18:03,900 --> 01:18:08,100
- when you told my son
that he ought to answer back.

692
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:14,800
I wrote that I was sorry about that.
I'm sorry for that night ...

693
01:18:15,400 --> 01:18:19,500
... when I said that I was never ...

694
01:18:19,700 --> 01:18:25,200
I'm sorry for every time your food
was cold and you had to wait.

695
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:32,400
And I'm sorry for never spotting the
human being that did this for us.

696
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,800
I'll just start from the beginning.

697
01:18:38,000 --> 01:18:41,500
''I have not been able to express
my gratefulness to you.''

698
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:47,300
''The word grateful doesn't begin
to tell you what I feel.''

699
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
That's nice of you. Thank you.

700
01:18:57,900 --> 01:19:00,800
Thank you.

701
01:19:09,300 --> 01:19:13,000
Now I want you
to do something for me.

702
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:25,000
I'm sorry. Didn't I say ''what''?
I thought I did.

703
01:19:28,600 --> 01:19:32,900
- What?
- I want you to go on this trip.

704
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:36,700
- No, sir.
- I can't do this without you.

705
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:44,200
He might pull the stiff one-eye
on me. I need you to chaperone.

706
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:50,800
You said you liked convertibles.
Now I'm on the hook. Two days.

707
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:56,800
- I can't. My son.
- Bettes said he's doing fine.

708
01:19:57,700 --> 01:20:04,900
- Melvin, I'd rather not.
- Write a note. Ain't she sweet?

709
01:20:05,100 --> 01:20:11,200
- I need a hand and where is she?
- Your help obligates me?

710
01:20:11,900 --> 01:20:16,100
ls there any other way to see it?

711
01:20:17,700 --> 01:20:20,000
No.

712
01:20:24,700 --> 01:20:30,200
Here's a little suitcase.
Shocked that it's being used.

713
01:20:39,100 --> 01:20:41,900
There's no way to pack
for this trip.

714
01:21:05,800 --> 01:21:09,300
- You're still coming, aren't you?
- Yes.

715
01:21:10,600 --> 01:21:14,800
Melvin, exactly where are we going?

716
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:19,300
Just south of Baltimore.
I know what you're going to say.

717
01:21:19,500 --> 01:21:22,800
I mean ... I think I know.

718
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:30,100
- I'm not sure, but I think so.
- Should I bring something dressy?

719
01:21:32,600 --> 01:21:36,200
Will we be eating in restaurants
that have dress codes?

720
01:21:41,500 --> 01:21:43,500
Maybe ...

721
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:48,800
- Yes. Let's ... Let's.
- Okay.

722
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:55,800
- What did you think I'd ask?
- Whether crabs were in season now.

723
01:21:56,000 --> 01:22:00,300
Okay, then. Goodnight.

724
01:22:05,500 --> 01:22:09,800
- Anything unusual in his diet?
- No.

725
01:22:10,300 --> 01:22:16,300
Everybody gets their own cage?
Put him in with that one.

726
01:22:17,900 --> 01:22:19,700
Lip kiss.

727
01:22:22,700 --> 01:22:28,200
I love you. I'll miss you ...
Real sensitive.

728
01:22:29,200 --> 01:22:33,400
- Bye.
- Call when you're settled.

729
01:22:41,100 --> 01:22:45,400
- Have a good time.
- Don't run!

730
01:22:45,900 --> 01:22:50,600
Have fun, but don't run.

731
01:22:54,700 --> 01:22:58,200
- I'm sorry I'm not taking you.
- So am I, Frank.

732
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,200
Give me a hug.

733
01:23:02,200 --> 01:23:04,900
Everything's going to be okay.

734
01:23:05,100 --> 01:23:10,700
Soak it up. It's your last chance
for a hug for a few days.

735
01:23:16,500 --> 01:23:19,000
Hello.

736
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:29,600
Thank you for being on time.

737
01:23:31,500 --> 01:23:36,900
Carol the waitress. Simon the fag.

738
01:23:40,600 --> 01:23:44,300
Holy God. Who did that to you?

739
01:23:44,800 --> 01:23:49,900
I was attacked.
I walked in on some men robbing me.

740
01:23:50,100 --> 01:23:53,900
And I was hospitalized.

741
01:23:55,000 --> 01:24:00,000
- I almost died.
- Let's do the small talk later.

742
01:24:03,800 --> 01:24:06,800
- I was going to do that.
- Where should we sit?

743
01:24:07,000 --> 01:24:11,900
- There's no place cards.
- You need room.

744
01:24:13,400 --> 01:24:16,100
So I'll sit in the back.

745
01:24:30,000 --> 01:24:32,900
Never a break. Never.

746
01:24:33,700 --> 01:24:36,700
Thank you. It was very thoughtful.

747
01:24:37,500 --> 01:24:41,500
- You look like you're crowded.
- It's all right.

748
01:24:44,300 --> 01:24:45,500
Thanks.

749
01:24:54,300 --> 01:24:55,500
Thank you.

750
01:24:57,700 --> 01:24:59,700
You're welcome.

751
01:25:03,400 --> 01:25:07,100
I've got the whole trip programmed.

752
01:25:10,600 --> 01:25:15,200
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

753
01:25:16,400 --> 01:25:19,300
TO USE AS lCEBREAKER

754
01:25:19,500 --> 01:25:22,500
We've got good stuff here.

755
01:25:37,700 --> 01:25:40,300
I like this music.

756
01:25:42,300 --> 01:25:45,400
I like this music.

757
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:02,900
I'm sure
they did something really off.

758
01:26:03,100 --> 01:26:10,200
But something will always be off
for you, unless you set it straight.

759
01:26:11,100 --> 01:26:15,800
And maybe this thing happened to you
to give you a chance to do that.

760
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:18,800
Nonsense. You want to know why?

761
01:26:19,000 --> 01:26:23,100
Anyone interested in what Melvin
has to say, raise their hand.

762
01:26:31,600 --> 01:26:35,900
Want to know
what happened with my parents?

763
01:26:37,300 --> 01:26:42,000
- When I was ...
- Wait. I'm going to pull over.

764
01:26:45,800 --> 01:26:50,800
I always painted.
And my mom always encouraged me.

765
01:26:50,900 --> 01:26:54,900
She was sort of fabulous about it.

766
01:26:55,300 --> 01:27:01,300
She ... I was too young to think
there was anything wrong with it.

767
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,800
And she was very natural.

768
01:27:05,000 --> 01:27:08,500
So she used to pose nude for me.

769
01:27:08,600 --> 01:27:13,400
I always thought
that my father knew about it.

770
01:27:13,700 --> 01:27:17,400
- This stuff is pointless.
- Let him finish.

771
01:27:17,500 --> 01:27:21,500
- Do you want to hear my sad story?
- Stop!

772
01:27:23,500 --> 01:27:28,100
Go ahead. Don't let him stop you.

773
01:27:29,000 --> 01:27:34,300
One day he walked in and found us.
And he started screaming.

774
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:37,600
My father didn't come out
for 1 1 years.

775
01:27:37,800 --> 01:27:42,600
He used to hit me with a yardstick
if I made a mistake on the piano.

776
01:27:47,400 --> 01:27:52,700
Go ahead, Simon.
So he came in and he was yelling?

777
01:27:52,900 --> 01:27:55,200
Please, come on.

778
01:27:56,500 --> 01:27:59,300
He was ...

779
01:27:59,700 --> 01:28:04,400
I was defending my mother.

780
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:11,100
I was trying to make peace
in the lamest way.

781
01:28:11,300 --> 01:28:16,200
I said,
''She's not naked. It's art.''

782
01:28:19,500 --> 01:28:22,600
And he started hitting me.

783
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:26,300
He beat me unconscious.

784
01:28:26,800 --> 01:28:33,000
And he talked to me less and less.
He knew what I was before I did.

785
01:28:33,800 --> 01:28:38,500
The morning I left for college
he walked into my room.

786
01:28:38,700 --> 01:28:44,800
He held out his hand.
And it was filled with money.

787
01:28:45,600 --> 01:28:51,400
A big sweaty wad of money.

788
01:28:52,300 --> 01:28:57,500
And he said, ''I don't want you
to ever come back.''

789
01:28:57,700 --> 01:29:01,700
I just grabbed him
and I hugged him.

790
01:29:01,900 --> 01:29:05,700
And he turned and walked out.

791
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:21,300
- We all have these stories.
- It's not true.

792
01:29:21,600 --> 01:29:24,400
Some of us have great stories.

793
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:30,500
That take place at lakes with boats
and friends and noodle salad.

794
01:29:30,700 --> 01:29:35,700
No one here. But a lot of people.
That's their story ...

795
01:29:35,900 --> 01:29:41,500
Good times, noodle salad.
It's not that you had it bad, -

796
01:29:41,700 --> 01:29:46,300
- but that you're that pissed
that so many others had it good.

797
01:29:46,500 --> 01:29:51,300
- No! I don't think so.
- Not it at all, really.

798
01:29:52,100 --> 01:29:54,400
Not it at all?

799
01:29:55,000 --> 01:30:00,200
Let's go to the hotel.

800
01:30:00,400 --> 01:30:06,100
You'll see if you can get another
wad of sweaty money out of his hand.

801
01:30:15,500 --> 01:30:18,500
Can I ask you a personal question?

802
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:24,100
Sure.

803
01:30:24,200 --> 01:30:28,400
You ever get an erection
over a woman?

804
01:30:29,800 --> 01:30:36,000
- Wouldn't your life be easier ..?
- You consider your life easy?

805
01:30:37,400 --> 01:30:41,900
I give you that one.

806
01:30:44,400 --> 01:30:47,200
Nice packing.

807
01:30:55,200 --> 01:30:59,700
- Hey, Spence.
- Hey, Mom. Wait till you hear...

808
01:30:59,900 --> 01:31:04,200
- Why are you out of breath?
- Mom, lscored a goal.

809
01:31:04,300 --> 01:31:08,300
- You did?
- Yep. He was big. Charlie.

810
01:31:08,600 --> 01:31:13,000
That's great.
Oh my God!

811
01:31:13,800 --> 01:31:17,600
- We're playing again. Got to go.
- Wait ...

812
01:31:20,200 --> 01:31:24,600
- He scored a goal.
- I don't believe it.

813
01:31:24,800 --> 01:31:26,900
You would have died.

814
01:31:28,600 --> 01:31:32,700
My son was outside playing soccer.

815
01:31:32,900 --> 01:31:38,000
- Take me out dancing.
- Dancing?

816
01:31:39,800 --> 01:31:44,700
- I can't. I'm exhausted.
- Oh, come on.

817
01:31:44,900 --> 01:31:47,100
No.

818
01:31:47,300 --> 01:31:50,800
All right.

819
01:31:51,300 --> 01:31:56,100
- Are you sad or something?
- No. I'm nervous.

820
01:31:56,300 --> 01:32:02,400
It would be very rough, Carol,
if you weren't along.

821
01:32:15,100 --> 01:32:19,900
I'm happy.
And you're my date.

822
01:32:22,000 --> 01:32:25,300
Let's get dressed.

823
01:32:32,500 --> 01:32:38,100
I'm going to jump in the shower.
I'll be right with you.

824
01:33:15,300 --> 01:33:18,000
All set?

825
01:33:22,500 --> 01:33:24,900
- Do you sell hard-shell crabs?
- Yes.

826
01:33:25,100 --> 01:33:28,200
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

827
01:33:36,000 --> 01:33:39,000
- Do they sell hard-shells?
- Yes.

828
01:33:43,700 --> 01:33:45,700
Good evening.

829
01:33:45,900 --> 01:33:48,800
- You have hard-shells, right?
- Stop asking.

830
01:33:49,000 --> 01:33:52,800
- You can answer.
- Yes, we do.

831
01:33:53,700 --> 01:33:56,900
- I can give you a tie and jacket.
- What?

832
01:33:57,100 --> 01:34:00,400
They require a tie and jacket.

833
01:34:14,300 --> 01:34:21,200
No. I'm not putting that on. And I
won't let you inject me with plague.

834
01:34:21,400 --> 01:34:26,500
It's a nice place. You dry-clean
these all the time, don't you?

835
01:34:26,800 --> 01:34:29,800
I don't think so.

836
01:34:39,800 --> 01:34:43,100
You just wait here.

837
01:34:55,000 --> 01:34:56,600
Good evening.

838
01:34:58,600 --> 01:35:02,700
- I need a coat and tie.
- Come on in.

839
01:35:05,200 --> 01:35:09,200
- No?
- That one.

840
01:35:09,300 --> 01:35:12,000
And this tie.

841
01:35:21,300 --> 01:35:22,900
Excuse me.

842
01:35:26,900 --> 01:35:31,600
She's here.
We saved a table for you.

843
01:35:32,400 --> 01:35:38,100
- Should I get her for you?
- No. I'll just watch.

844
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,600
Ma'am ...

845
01:37:03,900 --> 01:37:06,300
You look so se ...

846
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:12,000
You look great.

847
01:37:13,300 --> 01:37:15,400
You look great.

848
01:37:25,700 --> 01:37:28,400
You want to dance?

849
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:32,400
I've been thinking about that
since you brought it up before.

850
01:37:32,900 --> 01:37:34,900
No.

851
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,800
I don't get this place.

852
01:37:40,000 --> 01:37:46,500
They make me buy a new outfit
and let you in in a housedress.

853
01:37:47,600 --> 01:37:53,000
What? Wait.
Where are you going? Why?

854
01:37:56,000 --> 01:37:59,900
I didn't mean it that way. Sit down.

855
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:05,300
- Give me the dirty look.
- Pay me a compliment, Melvin.

856
01:38:05,600 --> 01:38:08,400
I need one. Quick.

857
01:38:08,600 --> 01:38:12,600
What you just said hurt my feelings.

858
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:17,600
The minute someone gets that they
need you they threaten to walk out.

859
01:38:17,800 --> 01:38:22,400
A compliment is
something nice about somebody else.

860
01:38:22,700 --> 01:38:25,200
Now or never.

861
01:38:35,500 --> 01:38:38,700
And mean it.

862
01:38:49,000 --> 01:38:52,100
Can we order first?

863
01:38:58,000 --> 01:39:02,300
Two hard-shell crab dinners ...
Pitcher of cold beer.

864
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:06,800
- Baked or fries?
- Fries.

865
01:39:08,300 --> 01:39:11,800
- Fries.
- One baked, one fried.

866
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:16,300
I'll tell your waiter.

867
01:39:17,300 --> 01:39:24,100
I've got a great compliment for you.
And it's true.

868
01:39:25,000 --> 01:39:31,600
- I'm afraid it's something awful.
- Don't be pessimistic.

869
01:39:31,800 --> 01:39:38,200
Okay. Here I go.
Clearly a mistake.

870
01:39:39,800 --> 01:39:44,200
I've got this ... ailment.

871
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,000
My doctor,
a shrink I used to go to, -

872
01:39:52,200 --> 01:39:58,000
- says that in 50 or 60 percent
of the cases a pill really helps.

873
01:39:58,700 --> 01:40:02,000
I hate pills. Very dangerous thing.

874
01:40:02,100 --> 01:40:07,000
I'm using the word ''hate'' here
about pills.

875
01:40:07,100 --> 01:40:12,700
My compliment is, the night you came
over and told me you would never ...

876
01:40:15,100 --> 01:40:19,100
All right, you know what you said.

877
01:40:19,400 --> 01:40:22,600
My compliment to you is, -

878
01:40:23,100 --> 01:40:27,900
- the next morning
I started taking the pills.

879
01:40:31,400 --> 01:40:35,000
How is that a compliment for me?

880
01:40:39,800 --> 01:40:44,900
You make me
want to be a better man.

881
01:40:55,200 --> 01:40:59,400
That's maybe
the best compliment of my life.

882
01:41:03,700 --> 01:41:09,600
Maybe I overshot a bit
to keep you from walking out.

883
01:41:21,300 --> 01:41:27,000
How's it going with those pills?
Good, I hope, I hope, I hope.

884
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:36,100
It's little by little.

885
01:41:36,800 --> 01:41:42,000
It's exhausting talking like this.
Exhausting.

886
01:42:01,100 --> 01:42:06,000
Do you ever let a romantic moment
make you do something stupid?

887
01:42:06,200 --> 01:42:08,300
Never.

888
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:12,000
Here's the trouble with never.

889
01:42:33,400 --> 01:42:38,700
- You don't owe me that.
- That wasn't payment.

890
01:42:39,100 --> 01:42:44,700
When I first saw you
I thought you were handsome.

891
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:49,100
Then, of course, you spoke.

892
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:57,100
So now that your ...
soft underbelly is all exposed ...

893
01:42:58,000 --> 01:43:02,400
Tell me,
why did you bring me here?

894
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:06,400
Well, I ...

895
01:43:11,600 --> 01:43:16,900
- That's a personal question.
- Tell me, even if you're scared.

896
01:43:17,100 --> 01:43:21,000
- Scared?
- Tell me why you wanted me here.

897
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:26,100
If you ask me, I'll say yes.

898
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:29,600
I ...

899
01:43:31,200 --> 01:43:35,800
There's a lot of reasons.

900
01:43:36,500 --> 01:43:42,700
- If you had sex with Simon ...
- What?

901
01:43:43,600 --> 01:43:49,300
- That's just one idea.
- That's why you brought me?

902
01:43:49,400 --> 01:43:53,900
Like I'm a what ..?
And I owe you what?

903
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:58,800
I don't know why I brought you.
It was just one thought.

904
01:43:58,900 --> 01:44:02,500
It came out first.

905
01:44:02,700 --> 01:44:06,800
You kiss him ... me ...
You two seemed to hit it off.

906
01:44:07,000 --> 01:44:11,700
Wait. I didn't mean ...
Forget what I said about Simon.

907
01:44:11,900 --> 01:44:15,600
- I'll never forget it.
- A mistake.

908
01:44:15,800 --> 01:44:18,200
It was a mistake.

909
01:44:23,800 --> 01:44:28,400
Hello, this is Fred Bishop.
We're unable to take yourcall.

910
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:34,200
- Leave a message.
- Say goodbye ... and thank you.

911
01:44:34,500 --> 01:44:37,500
It's Simon.

912
01:44:38,100 --> 01:44:41,000
I'm in town.

913
01:44:45,200 --> 01:44:51,200
You've never been out later than
ten o'clock. Pick up the phone.

914
01:44:53,300 --> 01:44:56,300
Really.

915
01:44:59,600 --> 01:45:04,200
I'm going to try you in the morning.
I need to see you.

916
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:07,400
Or at least
get you to answer the phone.

917
01:45:16,400 --> 01:45:18,100
How are you?

918
01:45:19,000 --> 01:45:23,800
- ls this going to be your room?
- Our room. I don't want to see him.

919
01:45:24,600 --> 01:45:28,700
- What happened?
- Don't ask.

920
01:45:31,300 --> 01:45:35,600
- Can you not be so violent?
- I don't think so.

921
01:45:38,900 --> 01:45:42,000
I'm taking a big bath.

922
01:45:42,200 --> 01:45:45,200
Are you okay?

923
01:45:45,600 --> 01:45:49,400
Don't ask.
I'm tired of my complaints.

924
01:45:49,600 --> 01:45:54,400
- What are you thinking about?
- How to die, mostly.

925
01:45:55,900 --> 01:46:00,900
Can you believe, in our little mix
you're the good roommate?

926
01:46:12,800 --> 01:46:15,100
Goodnight.

927
01:46:57,500 --> 01:47:01,300
Hold it.

928
01:47:20,200 --> 01:47:23,400
I have to draw you.

929
01:47:25,400 --> 01:47:28,700
- I have to draw you.
- No.

930
01:47:28,800 --> 01:47:33,400
- I'm more shy than people think.
- I have to.

931
01:47:33,600 --> 01:47:38,000
- I haven't sketched in weeks.
- Stop staring. Do a vase.

932
01:47:39,500 --> 01:47:44,300
But you're beautiful, Carol.
Your skin, your long neck.

933
01:47:44,900 --> 01:47:48,300
The back. The line of you.

934
01:47:49,800 --> 01:47:54,300
You're why cavemen
chiselled on walls.

935
01:47:56,400 --> 01:47:59,500
Cut me a break.

936
01:48:21,600 --> 01:48:25,400
The next thing I know
she's sitting next to me.

937
01:48:26,700 --> 01:48:32,100
It's not right to go into details.
I got nervous.

938
01:48:32,200 --> 01:48:35,600
I said the wrong thing.

939
01:48:38,600 --> 01:48:41,600
Where, if I hadn't, -

940
01:48:41,800 --> 01:48:45,700
- I could be in bed now
with a woman who ...

941
01:48:45,900 --> 01:48:50,100
If you make her laugh,
you got a life.

942
01:48:51,200 --> 01:48:54,100
lnstead, I'm here with you.

943
01:48:54,300 --> 01:48:59,400
No offence, but a moron
pushing the last legal drug.

944
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,900
Jameson, soda back.

945
01:49:07,500 --> 01:49:11,800
I don't care how you put this.
We're being naughty here, pal.

946
01:49:11,900 --> 01:49:16,900
No, this is ...
This is great. This is so great.

947
01:49:17,100 --> 01:49:21,900
My hand won't even keep up.
Hold it.

948
01:49:22,000 --> 01:49:25,800
- I'm just turning.
- But hold that.

949
01:49:26,700 --> 01:49:30,300
My hand's not even bothering me.

950
01:49:32,400 --> 01:49:36,300
I can't get the angle
with this cast.

951
01:49:39,700 --> 01:49:42,000
Careful.

952
01:49:48,300 --> 01:49:50,100
PRlVACY

953
01:49:53,100 --> 01:49:56,800
I'm coming in. It's late.

954
01:50:02,300 --> 01:50:08,000
- Did you have sex with her?
- Don't you want your shampoos?

955
01:50:11,900 --> 01:50:13,900
Sorry.

956
01:50:15,100 --> 01:50:19,500
I didn't know she was still here ...
Did you have sex with her?

957
01:50:19,600 --> 01:50:24,400
To hell with sex. It was better
than sex. We held each other.

958
01:50:25,300 --> 01:50:31,300
What I need, he gave me great.
I'll get dressed in a hurry.

959
01:50:36,300 --> 01:50:39,300
I just love her.

960
01:50:44,400 --> 01:50:47,600
How are you doing?

961
01:51:02,200 --> 01:51:06,100
- Mom, hi.
- Hello, Simon.

962
01:51:06,300 --> 01:51:09,900
- You were right We were home.
- Do you have to whisper?

963
01:51:10,000 --> 01:51:15,500
- I'm nota screamer.
- It was lucky you didn't answer.

964
01:51:15,600 --> 01:51:19,500
- Yourfatheris not feeling well.
- I can't hear you.

965
01:51:19,700 --> 01:51:22,900
- Hold on.
- What are you going to do?

966
01:51:23,500 --> 01:51:27,800
- I get why you're angry with me ...
- He's talking to his parents.

967
01:51:27,900 --> 01:51:32,600
Listen to me. Truly no grudges.

968
01:51:32,800 --> 01:51:37,400
It was odd that you didn't come and
see me when you heard I was hurt.

969
01:51:37,600 --> 01:51:40,500
- We almost did.
- I don't want to talk about it.

970
01:51:40,600 --> 01:51:45,100
The important thing is
that your son is happy.

971
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:48,500
- I'm working again.
- Good. Aboutmoney ...

972
01:51:48,700 --> 01:51:55,800
No. I'll drop you a line. It's up
to you to make the next move.

973
01:51:56,000 --> 01:52:01,300
He's going to want to stay.
And they'll take a ride to the lake.

974
01:52:02,100 --> 01:52:06,900
- Bye-bye.
- Goodbye, dear.

975
01:52:08,100 --> 01:52:13,000
We'll probably have a five-hour
drive. It'll give us a chance to ...

976
01:52:14,700 --> 01:52:18,100
- I'm coming.
- What about your parents?

977
01:52:18,300 --> 01:52:22,100
- No. I'll take care of myself.
- What are you talking about?

978
01:52:22,200 --> 01:52:27,500
- You've got real problems.
- I know. I'm a little bit nervous.

979
01:52:27,600 --> 01:52:31,300
Suddenly everything seems so easy.

980
01:52:31,700 --> 01:52:35,300
Carol, a load has been lifted.

981
01:52:37,700 --> 01:52:41,000
- One night wih me.
- You think you're kidding.

982
01:52:45,100 --> 01:52:50,400
- No choice.
- I've got a gift for you.

983
01:52:50,600 --> 01:52:54,400
Let me see ... Gorgeous.

984
01:52:55,300 --> 01:53:00,000
Do it. And get the dog picked up. I
can't believe he let it stay there.

985
01:53:00,200 --> 01:53:03,000
Goodbye.

986
01:53:03,200 --> 01:53:05,400
Your luck's running.

987
01:53:05,500 --> 01:53:10,700
They sub-let your place.
You're homeless.

988
01:53:10,800 --> 01:53:16,500
- Frank's got a line on a new place.
- Where?

989
01:53:17,200 --> 01:53:20,700
Does it matter?

990
01:53:21,800 --> 01:53:24,800
No, it doesn't.

991
01:53:25,700 --> 01:53:28,800
I'm fine. Like the hat?

992
01:53:29,900 --> 01:53:31,700
I'm sorry.

993
01:53:46,800 --> 01:53:49,200
FOR EMERGENCY USE ONLY

994
01:54:04,400 --> 01:54:09,700
- I don't want to hear that music.
- You said you liked it.

995
01:54:12,100 --> 01:54:18,500
- This one has a meaning.
- I don't want to hear it.

996
01:54:40,800 --> 01:54:45,000
Here's the keys to my apartment.

997
01:54:45,100 --> 01:54:49,400
Go up there and wait
and I'll take Carol home.

998
01:54:49,600 --> 01:54:54,100
- I'll take a bus.
- No, I'll take you.

999
01:54:59,500 --> 01:55:02,400
Can you come here?

1000
01:55:02,600 --> 01:55:06,400
- I don't care what you did for me.
- What's wrong?

1001
01:55:06,600 --> 01:55:12,000
I don't want to know you any more.
All you do is make me feel bad.

1002
01:55:15,300 --> 01:55:18,300
You have my number.

1003
01:55:19,700 --> 01:55:23,800
- Let him take you home.
- Don't want to.

1004
01:55:24,900 --> 01:55:28,100
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1005
01:55:36,600 --> 01:55:39,300
Don't say anything.

1006
01:55:42,900 --> 01:55:48,300
I've got to get a hold of Frank
and see where I'm hanging my hat.

1007
01:55:49,300 --> 01:55:53,000
I think you're going to
have to camp it here.

1008
01:55:53,200 --> 01:55:56,500
There's Verdell!

1009
01:56:04,700 --> 01:56:08,300
Mommy and Daddy are home.

1010
01:56:09,800 --> 01:56:14,100
Sorry. You're fun to mess with.

1011
01:56:15,200 --> 01:56:20,600
They rented your place furnished.
Jackie said she'd bring your things.

1012
01:56:20,700 --> 01:56:25,600
They were going to set you up
in here. It's an extra room.

1013
01:56:25,800 --> 01:56:30,800
- It's got good light.
- I'm coming.

1014
01:56:35,700 --> 01:56:39,700
It's nice. Looks good.

1015
01:56:39,900 --> 01:56:47,500
They've even got your music,
paintings, paints.

1016
01:56:47,700 --> 01:56:50,100
I have to say they did a good job.

1017
01:56:52,900 --> 01:56:59,100
It's going to be okay.
Cosy, huh?

1018
01:57:03,900 --> 01:57:08,400
Thank you, Melvin.
You overwhelm me.

1019
01:57:15,700 --> 01:57:19,500
I love you.

1020
01:57:23,600 --> 01:57:30,300
I'd be the luckiest guy alive
if that did it for me.

1021
01:57:42,400 --> 01:57:46,100
Make yourself at home.

1022
01:57:47,400 --> 01:57:50,000
Anything else in the bag?

1023
01:57:50,200 --> 01:57:54,000
But I was playing soccer
while you were away.

1024
01:57:54,100 --> 01:57:57,600
I love my cookbook.

1025
01:57:57,800 --> 01:58:02,800
It's got wonderful recipes.
It says something with a shark.

1026
01:58:03,000 --> 01:58:08,200
Shark with a bite.
Would you like that, Spencer?

1027
01:58:08,400 --> 01:58:11,100
And some cookies here
called Wasps' Nests.

1028
01:58:14,500 --> 01:58:18,000
Where is my big hairy boy?

1029
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:23,000
Where is he?
Where is my beautiful boy?

1030
01:58:23,100 --> 01:58:25,300
Sweetheart!

1031
01:58:25,500 --> 01:58:28,900
- Oh, you're in bed.
- No, no.

1032
01:58:32,300 --> 01:58:39,500
I just didn't think Verdell should
get too comfortable sleeping here.

1033
01:58:39,700 --> 01:58:43,400
The dog's already comfortable.

1034
01:58:47,400 --> 01:58:49,300
ls this okay?

1035
01:58:51,300 --> 01:58:54,800
Hello ... Hi, it's me.

1036
01:58:55,300 --> 01:59:00,600
He took me in.
It's Carol for you.

1037
01:59:00,700 --> 01:59:05,600
- Jackie brought it all over ...
- Just take the dog.

1038
01:59:06,600 --> 01:59:08,500
Take the dog.

1039
01:59:11,900 --> 01:59:17,400
- Come on. Move fast. Don't limp.
- Good luck.

1040
01:59:33,800 --> 01:59:36,900
- Howare you doing?
- Not so hot.

1041
01:59:37,100 --> 01:59:42,800
- Why? What's wrong?
- Was I sensible or hard on you?

1042
01:59:43,100 --> 01:59:49,400
- Maybe both.
- Are you being cute or crazy now?

1043
01:59:49,600 --> 01:59:54,200
- Cute.
- You don't have to answer.

1044
01:59:54,400 --> 01:59:56,900
Just listen to me.

1045
01:59:57,600 --> 02:00:01,900
It's really something
that you're looking after Simon.

1046
02:00:02,100 --> 02:00:07,800
And what I said on the street ...
That was a bad thing to say.

1047
02:00:08,000 --> 02:00:14,100
It made me sick to my stomach.
It was a bad thing to say.

1048
02:00:14,500 --> 02:00:19,200
And I'd be lying if I didn't say
I enjoy your company.

1049
02:00:20,800 --> 02:00:26,900
But you do bother me.
And I know it's better for me ...

1050
02:00:27,100 --> 02:00:31,700
... to not have contact with you
because you're not ready.

1051
02:00:31,900 --> 02:00:36,400
You're an old guy to not be ready.
And I'm too old to ignore that.

1052
02:00:36,600 --> 02:00:42,300
But there were extraordinary
kindnesses that did take place.

1053
02:00:49,000 --> 02:00:51,900
Anyway. Thanks for the trip.

1054
02:00:53,700 --> 02:00:56,000
Goodnight.

1055
02:00:56,200 --> 02:00:59,300
Okay if I say something now?

1056
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,900
Go ahead.

1057
02:01:06,900 --> 02:01:11,100
I should have danced with you.

1058
02:01:14,200 --> 02:01:17,700
Goodnight.

1059
02:01:37,200 --> 02:01:41,800
- Are you going to talk to me?
- I'm coming.

1060
02:01:52,200 --> 02:01:57,300
- What did she say?
- That I'm a great guy.

1061
02:01:57,400 --> 02:02:01,700
And she doesn't want
contact with me.

1062
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:05,700
I'm dying here.

1063
02:02:07,000 --> 02:02:12,900
- Because ... you love her.
- No.

1064
02:02:13,100 --> 02:02:16,300
And you people
are supposed to be sensitive?

1065
02:02:16,500 --> 02:02:20,900
Then you tell me why.
You're the one who's ''dying here''.

1066
02:02:21,100 --> 02:02:24,800
- Let me sleep on it.
- Oh, come on.

1067
02:02:24,900 --> 02:02:28,700
- I'll figure it out.
- Please ...

1068
02:02:30,100 --> 02:02:36,500
I'm stuck.
I can't get back to my old life.

1069
02:02:38,700 --> 02:02:43,600
- She's evicted me from my life.
- Did you really like it that much?

1070
02:02:43,700 --> 02:02:47,000
It's better than this.

1071
02:02:47,100 --> 02:02:51,600
If you're going to give me hope,
you've got to do better.

1072
02:02:51,700 --> 02:02:55,600
If you can't be mildly interesting,
then shut up.

1073
02:02:55,800 --> 02:02:59,800
I'm drowning here!
And you're describing the water.

1074
02:03:00,000 --> 02:03:03,100
Picking on me won't help.

1075
02:03:04,200 --> 02:03:08,100
If that's true,
I'm really in trouble.

1076
02:03:08,200 --> 02:03:12,300
Do you know where you're lucky?

1077
02:03:17,000 --> 02:03:20,700
You know who you want.

1078
02:03:20,900 --> 02:03:26,900
I would take your seat any day.
Do something. Go over there.

1079
02:03:27,100 --> 02:03:32,400
Tonight. It's not always good
to let things calm down.

1080
02:03:32,600 --> 02:03:36,600
You can do this, Melvin.

1081
02:03:36,800 --> 02:03:40,000
Tell her how you feel.

1082
02:03:40,200 --> 02:03:44,400
- I'm charged.
- Yes, you are.

1083
02:03:44,600 --> 02:03:49,200
- She might kill me if I go there.
- Then stay. I'll read you a story.

1084
02:03:49,300 --> 02:03:55,100
The best thing going for you is your
willingness to humiliate yourself.

1085
02:03:55,300 --> 02:03:59,100
Go over there.
Do this. Catch her off guard.

1086
02:04:08,900 --> 02:04:11,500
Thanks a lot.

1087
02:04:13,200 --> 02:04:16,000
Here I go.

1088
02:04:25,000 --> 02:04:27,800
What's wrong?

1089
02:04:29,400 --> 02:04:32,600
I forgot to lock the door.

1090
02:05:50,800 --> 02:05:54,500
- What do you want?
- I'm sorry I woke you up.

1091
02:05:54,600 --> 02:05:57,900
I wasn't asleep.

1092
02:06:01,300 --> 02:06:04,300
What a break.

1093
02:06:05,200 --> 02:06:08,900
ls it a secret
what you're doing here?

1094
02:06:11,200 --> 02:06:14,100
I had to see you.

1095
02:06:17,300 --> 02:06:19,600
Because?

1096
02:06:22,000 --> 02:06:26,000
It relaxes me.

1097
02:06:26,500 --> 02:06:30,600
I'd feel better sitting outside
your apartment on the curb -

1098
02:06:30,800 --> 02:06:35,200
- than any other place
I can think of or imagine.

1099
02:06:35,400 --> 02:06:38,000
That's overstating.

1100
02:06:38,200 --> 02:06:44,100
I'd rather be sitting inside so I
don't get my feet in the gutter.

1101
02:06:44,200 --> 02:06:49,800
Stop. Why can't I just have
a normal boyfriend? Why?

1102
02:06:49,900 --> 02:06:53,700
A regular boyfriend
who doesn't go nuts on me.

1103
02:06:53,900 --> 02:06:57,200
Everybody wants that.
It doesn't exist.

1104
02:07:00,900 --> 02:07:06,000
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to interrupt.

1105
02:07:12,100 --> 02:07:15,300
Boyfriend ...

1106
02:07:18,200 --> 02:07:23,500
Come on in and try
not to ruin everything by being you.

1107
02:07:23,700 --> 02:07:27,900
Maybe we could live
without the wisecracks?

1108
02:07:31,200 --> 02:07:35,000
Maybe we could.

1109
02:07:59,900 --> 02:08:04,900
It feels a little confined here.
Let's take a walk.

1110
02:08:07,800 --> 02:08:13,400
It's four in the morning.
A walk sounds a little screwy to me.

1111
02:08:14,200 --> 02:08:19,400
- If you don't mind.
- Well, if you need an excuse ...

1112
02:08:20,200 --> 02:08:24,400
There's a bakery on the corner
that'll be open soon.

1113
02:08:24,600 --> 02:08:30,400
That way we're not screwy,
but two people that like warm rolls.

1114
02:08:54,700 --> 02:09:01,100
- What are you doing?
- I want you to hear that song.

1115
02:09:08,500 --> 02:09:13,300
And darling
I'm neverlonely

1116
02:09:13,500 --> 02:09:17,000
wheneveryou're in sight...

1117
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:19,800
Thank you.

1118
02:09:21,300 --> 02:09:24,600
I was ...

1119
02:09:38,500 --> 02:09:43,800
I'm sorry.
Whatever this is won't work.

1120
02:09:52,200 --> 02:09:54,600
- I'm ...
- What?

1121
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:59,600
I'm feeling better.

1122
02:09:59,800 --> 02:10:06,600
It may seem that way now,
but you don't know me all that well.

1123
02:10:07,500 --> 02:10:10,600
I'm not the answer for you.

1124
02:10:10,700 --> 02:10:14,800
- I've got a compliment for you.
- You know what?

1125
02:10:15,000 --> 02:10:18,900
Let me talk.

1126
02:10:25,500 --> 02:10:29,200
I might be the only person
on the earth -

1127
02:10:29,400 --> 02:10:32,400
- that knows
you're the greatest woman on earth.

1128
02:10:32,600 --> 02:10:40,200
I might be the only one who knows
how amazing you are.

1129
02:10:40,500 --> 02:10:44,700
And how you are with Spencer.
Spence.

1130
02:10:45,900 --> 02:10:50,100
And in every single thought
you have.

1131
02:10:50,300 --> 02:10:57,000
How you almost always mean something
that's about being straight or good.

1132
02:10:58,300 --> 02:11:02,100
Most people miss that about you.

1133
02:11:02,400 --> 02:11:07,600
I wonder how they can watch you
bring their food and clear tables -

1134
02:11:07,800 --> 02:11:12,100
- and never get that they just met
the greatest woman alive.

1135
02:11:12,300 --> 02:11:17,400
And the fact that I get it
makes me feel good ...

1136
02:11:18,300 --> 02:11:22,600
... about me.

1137
02:11:29,000 --> 02:11:35,400
ls that something
that it's bad for you to be around?

1138
02:11:44,600 --> 02:11:47,000
No.

1139
02:11:49,800 --> 02:11:53,000
I'm going to grab you?

1140
02:11:53,200 --> 02:11:57,900
I didn't mean for that to be
a question. I'm going to grab you.

1141
02:12:21,400 --> 02:12:24,200
I know I can do better than that.

1142
02:12:47,700 --> 02:12:51,600
Better. Definitely better.

1143
02:12:55,600 --> 02:12:58,600
See?

1144
02:13:12,600 --> 02:13:17,300
- Want something?
- Warm rolls.

1145
02:13:25,800 --> 02:13:28,100
Excuse us.
