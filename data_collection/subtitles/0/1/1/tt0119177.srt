1
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,390
<i>Welcome to Gattaca.</i>

2
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,109
You keep your workstation so clean.

3
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,273
- It's next to godliness.
- Godliness <i>...</i>

4
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:24,036
I reviewed your flight plan. Not
one error in a million keystrokes.

5
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:29,228
Phenomenal. It's right that someone
like you is taking us to Titan.

6
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,871
Has the committee approved the
mission? There's talk of delay.

7
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:38,909
You shouldn't listen to talk.
You leave in a week.

8
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,153
You've got a substance test.

9
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:16,470
<i>If you have to take a substance</i>
<i>test, report to the testing centre.</i>

10
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:28,430
Jerome. Never shy.
Pisses on command.

11
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:33,116
- A beautiful piece of equipment.
- You tell me every time I'm here.

12
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:40,595
I see a great many in my job.
Yours happens to be exceptional.

13
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:46,475
why didn't my folks
order one like that for me?

14
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,759
- Have I ever told you about my son?
- No.

15
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,117
Remind me to, sometime.

16
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:13,229
So you're about to go up.
One week left.

17
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,712
Please tell me
you're the least bit excited.

18
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:22,912
I'll tell you
at the end of the week.

19
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,870
congratulations, Jerome.

20
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,952
Thank you.

21
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:46,155
How many launches are there
in a day? A dozen?

22
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:52,998
- Sometimes more.
- Only you watch every one of them.

23
00:07:55,920 --> 00:08:00,914
If you're going to pretend
like you don't care, don't look up.

24
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:03,992
<i>The most unremarkable of events.</i>

25
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:09,028
<i>Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1st class,</i>
<i>is about to embark -</i>

26
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:14,991
<i>- on a one-year manned mission</i>
<i>to Titan, the 14th moon of Saturn.</i>

27
00:08:15,160 --> 00:08:20,871
<i>This highly prestigious assignment</i>
<i>was guaranteed Jerome at birth.</i>

28
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:28,832
<i>He has all the gifts required.</i>
<i>A genetic quotient second to none.</i>

29
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,233
<i>There's nothing remarkable about</i>
<i>the progress of Jerome Morrow.</i>

30
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:38,029
<i>Ex cept that I am not Jerome Morrow.</i>

31
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:50,875
<i>I was conceived in the Riviera.</i>
<i>Not the French Riviera.</i>

32
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:54,032
<i>The Detroit variety.</i>

33
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:59,957
<i>They used to say that a love child</i>
<i>has a greater chance of happiness.</i>

34
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,192
<i>They don't say that any more.</i>

35
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:08,235
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>why my mother trusted God</i> <i>-</i>

36
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,392
<i>- rather than her local geneticist.</i>

37
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:18,635
<i>Ten fingers, ten toes, that's all</i>
<i>that used to matter... Not now.</i>

38
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,069
<i>Only seconds old, the ex act time</i>
<i>and cause of my death was known.</i>

39
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,513
Neurological condition, 60%,
manic depression, 42% probability.

40
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:39,276
Attention deficit disorder,
89% probability. Heart disorder <i>...</i>

41
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:45,439
<i>...</i> 99% probability.
Early fatal potential.

42
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:51,789
- Life expectancy: 30.2 years.
- 30 years?

43
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:58,034
- The name for the certificate?
<i>- Vincent</i> Anton.

44
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,073
That's a good name.

45
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:10,358
I know he'll do something.
You'll do something.

46
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,675
<i>I quickly thought of myself</i>
<i>as others did. chronically ill.</i>

47
00:10:19,840 --> 00:10:23,799
<i>Every skinned knee and runny nose</i>
<i>was treated as a fatal threat.</i>

48
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:30,798
The insurance won't cover it. If he
fell <i>...</i> There's nothing I can do.

49
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,879
<i>Like most other parents then,</i>
<i>they wanted their next child</i> <i>-</i>

50
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,670
<i>- to be conceived in what</i>
<i>has become the natural way.</i>

51
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:52,753
Your extracted eggs, Marie, -

52
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:57,550
- have been fertilized
with Antonio's sperm.

53
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:03,238
we have screened two healthy boys
and two very healthy girls.

54
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:07,712
without predispositions
to any inheritable diseases.

55
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:15,195
Let's select the most compatible
candidate. what gender do you want?

56
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:21,356
we would want Vincent
to have a brother to play with.

57
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:29,638
You have specified hazel eyes,
dark hair and <i>...</i> fair skin.

58
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:33,315
I've eradicated
prejudicial conditions:

59
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:39,953
Premature baldness, alcoholism,
propensity for violence, obesity.

60
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,954
we didn't want <i>...</i>
Diseases, yes, but <i>...</i>

61
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,954
we would like to leave
a few things to chance.

62
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,797
Give your child the best start. we
have enough imperfection built-in.

63
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:59,751
Your child doesn't need any
additional burdens. It's still you.

64
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,832
Simply the best of you.

65
00:12:03,000 --> 00:12:07,710
You could conceive naturally 1,000
times and never get such a result.

66
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:15,713
<i>That's how Anton came to be.</i>
<i>A son worthy of my father's name.</i>

67
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:32,716
- I'm proud of you, son.
- See how much he's grown.

68
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,359
<i>when we played blood brothers</i> <i>-</i>

69
00:12:48,520 --> 00:12:52,308
<i>- I understood my blood was</i>
<i>very different from Anton's.</i>

70
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:58,271
<i>I'd need a lot more than a drop</i>
<i>if I was going to get anywhere.</i>

71
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:20,868
<i>we played chicken.</i>
<i>when our parents weren't watching</i> <i>-</i>

72
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:26,876
<i>- we'd swim as far out as we dared</i>
<i>and see who'd turn back first.</i>

73
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,552
come on, you coward!

74
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:47,478
<i>Of course it was always me.</i>

75
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:52,998
<i>Anton was the stronger swimmer</i>
<i>and had no ex cuse to fail.</i>

76
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:00,709
300 million,
350 million, 400 million.

77
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:05,829
<i>Maybe it was my love of the planets</i>
<i>or just my dislike for this one,</i> <i>-</i>

78
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:11,028
<i>- but for as long as I remember</i>
<i>I've dreamed of going into space.</i>

79
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:16,672
750 million,
800 million, 850 million.

80
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:22,597
How many astronauts are there?
I bet I could be one if I wanted.

81
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:25,911
Don't eat that. It's Pluto.

82
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:35,352
<i>My goals didn't change a lot.</i>
<i>Much to my parents' dismay.</i>

83
00:14:35,520 --> 00:14:38,637
Vincent <i>...</i>

84
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,798
Be realistic. with
a heart condition like yours <i>...</i>

85
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:53,399
- There's a chance my heart's fine.
- One chance in 100.

86
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:58,315
- I'll take it.
- They won't.

87
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:02,917
You've got to understand something.

88
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,676
You'll only get inside a spaceship
to clean it.

89
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:18,713
<i>He was right. I lied on my resum,</i>
<i>but my real resum was my cells.</i>

90
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,316
<i>why waste money on training me</i> <i>-</i>

91
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:26,712
<i>- when there are 1, 000 other</i>
<i>applicants with a cleaner profile?</i>

92
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,158
<i>It is illegal to discriminate.</i>
<i>"Genoism", it's called.</i>

93
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:34,073
<i>But no one takes the law seriously.</i>

94
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:45,709
<i>If you refuse to tell, they take</i>
<i>a sample from a door handle</i> <i>-</i>

95
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:51,318
<i>- or a handshake. Even the saliva</i>
<i>on your application form.</i>

96
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:54,790
<i>A legal drug test can become-</i>

97
00:15:54,960 --> 00:16:00,796
<i>- an illegal peek</i>
<i>at your future in the company.</i>

98
00:16:06,520 --> 00:16:10,991
Sure you want to do this?
You know you're going to lose.

99
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,277
<i>It was the last time we swam</i>
<i>together. Out into the open sea.</i>

100
00:16:24,440 --> 00:16:30,788
<i>Knowing each stroke out was one</i>
<i>we'd have to make back.</i>

101
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:48,028
<i>But something was different. Every</i>
<i>time Anton tried to pull away</i> <i>-</i>

102
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:52,113
<i>- he found me right beside him.</i>

103
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:57,599
<i>Until finally</i>
<i>the impossible happened.</i>

104
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:59,751
Vincent!

105
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,791
<i>For once in our lives Anton was</i>
<i>not as strong as he believed</i> <i>-</i>

106
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:23,988
<i>- and I was not as weak. That</i>
<i>made everything else possible.</i>

107
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:12,270
<i>Like others in my situation I moved</i>
<i>around getting work where I could.</i>

108
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:16,718
<i>I must've cleaned</i>
<i>half the toilets in the state.</i>

109
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:22,830
<i>The underclass wasn't determined</i>
<i>by social status or skin colour now.</i>

110
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:29,075
- welcome to Gattaca, gentlemen.
<i>- Today discrimination is a science.</i>

111
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:34,598
There's your cleaning material.
Start here and clean to the back.

112
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:38,355
I want to see my smiling face
on that floor.

113
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:50,879
Dreaming of space, Your Majesty?

114
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,998
come here.

115
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,838
Start by cleaning this space.

116
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:08,556
<i>I knew how far away I was from my</i>
<i>goal when I stood right beside it.</i>

117
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:22,192
- Don't clean the glass too well.
- what do you mean?

118
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:24,920
You might get ideas.

119
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:30,234
But if the glass is clean, it'll be
easier to see me on the other side.

120
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,115
<i>I knew it was just brave talk.</i>
<i>No matter how much I studied, -</i>

121
00:21:24,280 --> 00:21:28,751
<i>- the best test score in the world</i>
<i>needs a blood test to match it.</i>

122
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,474
<i>I had to go to extreme measures.</i>

123
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,156
<i>The man who came didn't ex actly</i>
<i>advertise in the Yellow Pages.</i>

124
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,754
Stand straight.

125
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,508
- How did you hear about me?
- People.

126
00:21:46,680 --> 00:21:51,754
Any distinguishing marks?
Tattoos, scars, birth marks?

127
00:21:51,920 --> 00:21:54,354
No.

128
00:21:54,520 --> 00:21:58,991
Are you serious about this?
I hope you're not wasting my time.

129
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:04,473
- I'd give 100%.
- That'll get you halfway there.

130
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,988
That's an old edition,
but I know it all by heart.

131
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:18,109
- The commitment is binding.
- You have somebody in mind?

132
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:44,597
<i>For the genetic elite, success</i>
<i>is attainable, but not guaranteed.</i>

133
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,799
<i>There is no gene for fate.</i>

134
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,034
<i>And when a member of the elite</i>
<i>falls on hard times</i> <i>-</i>

135
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:58,352
<i>- their genetic identity</i>
<i>becomes a valued commodity.</i>

136
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:01,273
<i>One man's loss is another's gain.</i>

137
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:05,069
He's got impeccable credentials.
An unbelievable expiration date.

138
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,469
He'll practically live forever.
His IQ is off the register.

139
00:23:15,640 --> 00:23:22,034
Better than 20/20 vision. Strong
heart. He could run through a wall.

140
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,869
If he could still run.

141
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:33,953
He was a big-time swimming star.

142
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:40,275
You could go anywhere with this
guy's DNA tucked under your arm.

143
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:48,439
- You look so right together.
- we don't look anything alike.

144
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,550
Nobody looks at photos today.
christ, you could have my face.

145
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,238
- How do I explain the accident?
- It happened out of the country.

146
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:07,158
No one knows he broke his back. He's
still a fully productive citizen.

147
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:12,917
- Just fill in his last year.
- You're a foreigner.

148
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:18,359
They don't care where you were born.
Blood has no nationality.

149
00:24:18,520 --> 00:24:22,911
As long as it's got what they want,
it's the only passport you'll need.

150
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:30,037
- who lives up there?
- well, I certainly don't.

151
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:34,156
<i>The process of becoming him began.</i>

152
00:24:34,320 --> 00:24:38,518
<i>Myopia is one of the most obvious</i>
<i>signs of a disadvantaged birth.</i>

153
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:43,231
- Isn't there another way?
- Surgery will leave scars.

154
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:47,359
It's contact lenses or a white cane.

155
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,957
- Besides, the colour doesn't match.
- He's right.

156
00:24:52,120 --> 00:24:55,795
My eyes are prettier.

157
00:24:57,400 --> 00:25:00,233
I take 25% of all you make.

158
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:05,235
If it fails, all this equipment
must be returned in seven days.

159
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,393
- And you lose your deposit.
- wait! You said 20%.

160
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:12,518
- 20%.
- It's not negotiable.

161
00:25:27,520 --> 00:25:33,152
- I guess that's it.
- No. There's still the height.

162
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:38,440
How tall were you
before the accident?

163
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:44,118
- His profile says he's 6' 1 ".
- I can wear lifts.

164
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:50,510
Even with lifts
you're not that tall.

165
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:53,877
So what?

166
00:25:58,200 --> 00:26:00,395
No <i>...</i>

167
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:07,233
- we never discussed that.
- I thought you were serious.

168
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:11,359
I am. I'm not doing that.

169
00:26:14,560 --> 00:26:16,437
No.

170
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,478
<i>Now Jerome knew I was committed.</i>

171
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:30,191
<i>I endured the pain by reminding</i>
<i>myself that when I did stand up</i> <i>-</i>

172
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:34,353
<i>- I'd be ex actly two inches</i>
<i>closer to the stars.</i>

173
00:26:34,520 --> 00:26:42,393
- Are you all right?
- Yeah. Do you want to go dancing?

174
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:49,319
You had to be a right-hander.
No one orders southpaws any more.

175
00:26:50,760 --> 00:26:55,754
Jerome Morrow. It's a nice name.

176
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,714
- It's my name.
- I can't be you without it.

177
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:05,839
what makes you think
you can be me at all?

178
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,798
Look at this.

179
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,272
- Look at it.
- It's nice.

180
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:28,352
- Is it real?
- Are you colour-blind? It's silver.

181
00:27:28,520 --> 00:27:33,674
Jerome Morrow was never meant
to be one step down on the podium.

182
00:27:33,840 --> 00:27:40,712
with all I had going for me,
I was still second best.

183
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:46,193
Me!
So how do you expect to pull it off?

184
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:52,150
I don't know, exactly.

185
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,472
Your signature needs work.

186
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:01,393
<i>Soon we were put to the test.</i>

187
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:07,954
<i>Jerome had the genes to get</i>
<i>into Gattaca, but not the desire.</i>

188
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:13,319
- Do you really want to be in there?
- Not in there. Up there.

189
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:21,072
- what's up there?
- That's want I want to see, Jerome.

190
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,830
call me Eugene. My middle name.

191
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:31,833
If you're going to be Jerome,
you better start getting used to it.

192
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:45,392
- I must go. where's my sample?
- In the fridge. Door on the left.

193
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:50,833
- which pouch?
- Any of them.

194
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:57,874
- You think I should test it?
- If you like.

195
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:09,396
- what's wrong with the machine?
- You've been drinking again!

196
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:14,190
- I haven't.
- christ, it's eight in the morning!

197
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:25,630
This is no joke.
My interview is in an hour!

198
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:36,759
- There's more vodka than piss!
- I had half a glass to celebrate.

199
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:41,391
- Friday's will be all right.
- There's only wednesday left.

200
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:44,870
That's the one.

201
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:59,990
It's not too late to back out.

202
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:07,079
This is the last day
you will be you and I will be me.

203
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:12,432
well?

204
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,431
- congratulations.
- what about the interview?

205
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:46,830
That was it.

206
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:57,632
I got it.

207
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,792
Of course you got it.

208
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:15,792
<i>Each day I would dispose of</i>
<i>all my loose skin, nails and hair.</i>

209
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:21,592
<i>To limit how much of my In- Valid</i>
<i>self I'd leave in the Valid world.</i>

210
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:33,189
<i>Eugene prepared samples of his</i>
<i>body matter so I'd pass for him.</i>

211
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,591
<i>Urine for the substance tests.</i>

212
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:43,108
<i>Blood for the security checks</i>
<i>and vials filled with other traces.</i>

213
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:47,239
<i>Eugene gave me his identity</i>
<i>while I paid the rent</i> <i>-</i>

214
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:51,951
<i>- and kept him in the style</i>
<i>to which he'd become accustomed.</i>

215
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:58,275
<i>Eugene had never been called</i>
<i>"utero", "faith birth", "In-valid".</i>

216
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:05,039
<i>As a "Valid", he suffered</i>
<i>under the burden of perfection.</i>

217
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:12,592
<i>I was now a member of a new</i>
<i>and detested segment of society.</i>

218
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:19,313
<i>One of those who won't accept</i>
<i>their fate. A "borrowed ladder".</i>

219
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,677
<i>Or... a "de-gene-erate".</i>

220
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:33,229
<i>In the guise of Jerome Morrow</i>
<i>I've risen quickly in Gattaca.</i>

221
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:38,394
<i>Only one of the mission directors</i>
<i>has come close to exposing me.</i>

222
00:32:38,560 --> 00:32:44,874
<i>He may have more success exposing</i>
<i>me in death than he did in life.</i>

223
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,909
I think we can rule out suicide.

224
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,236
Thank you.

225
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:21,074
This will take a while.
we may have to push things back.

226
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:37,190
Irene, I want you
to assist the investigators.

227
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:42,992
- That would put me behind.
- I appreciate your sacrifice.

228
00:33:43,160 --> 00:33:47,950
- I won't lose my place in line?
- Your place is assured.

229
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:53,240
So kindly inform the authorities
we will cooperate in any way, -

230
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:57,552
- although we can't tolerate
a major disruption.

231
00:33:57,720 --> 00:34:02,669
- Thank you, Irene.
- Thank you, Director.

232
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:09,359
- How will this affect the mission?
- we'll go ahead as planned.

233
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:12,796
The launch can only be this week.

234
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:20,275
Tragic though this event may be, it
hasn't stopped the planets turning.

235
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:35,560
- what happened?
- I'm going up.

236
00:34:35,720 --> 00:34:40,919
- End of the week.
- That soon?

237
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:46,552
- what about the mission director?
- He's dead.

238
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,514
Are you serious?

239
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:57,232
They found him beaten so badly
they had to check his name tag.

240
00:34:58,040 --> 00:35:00,429
You are serious.

241
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:06,516
There's nothing
between us and ignition.

242
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:10,559
I'm going up.

243
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:13,598
- The man was murdered?
- I didn't do it.

244
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:19,756
- It'll be crawling with Hoovers.
- I'll handle the J. Edgars.

245
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,552
what if they do find something?
I'll be out of their jurisdiction.

246
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,951
we have to get drunk immediately.

247
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:44,712
Good evening, gentlemen. I hear
you're leaving us, Mr. Morrow.

248
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,032
- we're going to miss you.
- You've opened the wine, I hope?

249
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,839
Pour yourself a glass, cavendish.

250
00:36:14,520 --> 00:36:17,478
How old is the specimen?

251
00:36:17,640 --> 00:36:23,670
- I kissed him five minutes ago.
- I'll see what I can do.

252
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:31,509
- You want the full sequence?
- Yes.

253
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,990
Good luck.

254
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:58,197
- 9.3. Quite a catch.
- Yes. Quite a catch.

255
00:37:23,480 --> 00:37:29,430
God, I've told cavendish <i>...</i> This
has only been open five minutes!

256
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:32,034
wine needs to breathe.

257
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:38,992
They say being weightless is the
closest thing to being in the womb.

258
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,000
I can't believe you pulled this off.
They're sending you up there.

259
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,549
Up there! You, of all people.

260
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:54,396
You'll be alone
in that room for a year.

261
00:37:54,560 --> 00:38:00,078
- It's bigger than your tin can.
- what are you going to do?

262
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,835
I have my books.
I travel in my head.

263
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:08,232
I wish you had company.
Someone you didn't have to pay for.

264
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:13,520
- I wouldn't have it any other way.
- what are you going to do?

265
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:19,269
I'm going to finish this.

266
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:33,235
what's Titan like
this time of year?

267
00:38:35,160 --> 00:38:40,553
what's Titan like?
Titan is exactly like this.

268
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:57,150
The cloud around it is so thick,
no one can tell what's underneath.

269
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:03,229
- Maybe there's nothing there.
- There's something there.

270
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:12,753
- You should be going, not me.
- why is that?

271
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,830
Because up there
your legs wouldn't matter.

272
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:26,914
I'm scared of heights.

273
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:47,393
I'm sorry.

274
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:52,634
Do you want this?
I'll save some for you, shall I?

275
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:05,076
I'm so sorry.
I'm really, really sorry.

276
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:13,157
Don't give me a hard time.
Give me a break.

277
00:40:14,200 --> 00:40:20,070
- come on! Help!
- I'm sorry.

278
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:31,272
I wasn't drunk <i>...</i>

279
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:35,558
<i>...</i> when I walked
in front of that car.

280
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:41,113
I stepped right out in front of it.
I'd never been more sober, ever.

281
00:40:43,880 --> 00:40:48,078
- Go to sleep.
- I couldn't even get that right.

282
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:52,472
If at first you don't succeed,
try, try again.

283
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:55,791
Go to sleep.

284
00:40:59,360 --> 00:41:02,352
I'm proud of you, Vincent.

285
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:08,590
You must be drunk
to call me Vincent.

286
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:51,151
- How much do you need?
- 20 minutes.

287
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:12,678
You can go.

288
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,673
It's all right, Irene.
You're excused.

289
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:47,951
we found our man. It's the only
specimen we can't account for.

290
00:42:48,120 --> 00:42:52,432
- Every 10 years things go our way.
- Tell me about the eyelash.

291
00:42:52,600 --> 00:42:57,913
An unregistered In-Valid. A janitor.
He disappeared a few years back.

292
00:42:58,080 --> 00:43:03,871
- The specimen could be from then.
- Nothing lies around here for long.

293
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:08,397
would a janitor come back after so
long to kill a man he never knew?

294
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:10,710
His profile suggests he's violent.

295
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:18,958
It also suggests he's a sick man.
There's a 90% chance he's dead.

296
00:43:19,120 --> 00:43:23,079
That leaves a 10% chance
he's still alive.

297
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:28,473
The owner of the eyelash is the
murderer. I'll do a cross-check <i>...</i>

298
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:33,555
- He has no living relatives.
- That's a damn shame, sir.

299
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:37,349
check the entry log.
Alibis, grudges.

300
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:42,753
I see a lot of dry eyes. The mission
director was not universally loved.

301
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:47,152
He was leading cutbacks
in the programme.

302
00:43:47,320 --> 00:43:49,834
with all due respect, sir <i>...</i>

303
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:55,832
whatever you say.

304
00:44:09,640 --> 00:44:12,279
Jerome the metronome.

305
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:16,752
I could play the piano
by that heartbeat of his.

306
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:22,119
- we have a suspect.
- That is a relief. who is he?

307
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,831
we found an unaccounted-for
specimen. Here's his picture.

308
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:31,995
- An In-Valid.
- we're still following other leads.

309
00:44:32,160 --> 00:44:37,393
- I'm posting this immediately.
- I'm curious, Director.

310
00:44:37,560 --> 00:44:42,076
An advantage, I should imagine,
in your line of work.

311
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:46,995
- Your hiring practices <i>...</i>
- Our "recruitment philosophy".

312
00:44:47,160 --> 00:44:53,633
- who do you have to be, to be here?
- we don't take common citizens.

313
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:56,837
Are they all equally excellent?

314
00:44:57,000 --> 00:45:01,551
Occasionally we've had to accept
candidates with minor shortcomings.

315
00:45:01,720 --> 00:45:08,114
But nothing that would stop them
joining the police, for example.

316
00:45:08,280 --> 00:45:14,594
Now, there are enough of the right
kind to warrant a new standard.

317
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:21,552
Bodies with minds to match.
Essential, as we push out further.

318
00:45:21,720 --> 00:45:26,669
- Yet you still monitor performance.
- To see they meet their potential.

319
00:45:26,840 --> 00:45:30,628
- And exceeding it?
- No one exceeds his potential.

320
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:36,193
If he did, we just didn't accurately
gauge his potential right off.

321
00:45:47,480 --> 00:45:50,074
- All right?
- Terrific.

322
00:46:13,720 --> 00:46:17,554
The entry log for the past week.

323
00:46:19,040 --> 00:46:23,989
what about you, Irene?
Do you have an alibi?

324
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:29,075
- I was alone.
- I find that hard to believe.

325
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:41,874
I'll take care of that
for you, Mr. Morrow.

326
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:59,552
I see I'm not the only one who looks
up every time there's a launch.

327
00:47:02,200 --> 00:47:07,558
- It's awful about the director.
- Awful it didn't happen sooner.

328
00:47:07,720 --> 00:47:14,398
Didn't he threaten to cancel your
mission? Somebody did you a favour.

329
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:19,111
- Do they know who I should thank?
- They found an eyelash.

330
00:47:19,280 --> 00:47:24,229
- Does it have a name?
- Just some In-Valid.

331
00:47:24,400 --> 00:47:27,790
Jerome <i>...</i>

332
00:47:28,920 --> 00:47:33,391
I had you sequenced.
I read your profile.

333
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:36,757
I'm sorry.

334
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,757
Seems you're everything
they say you are and more.

335
00:47:42,920 --> 00:47:47,198
You're engineered
just like the rest of us.

336
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:50,557
Not quite.

337
00:47:50,720 --> 00:47:55,350
"Unacceptable likelihood of heart
failure." That's how they put it.

338
00:47:55,520 --> 00:48:00,071
The only trip I'll take in space
is around the sun on this satellite.

339
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:06,191
If there's anything wrong with you,
I can't see it from where I stand.

340
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,799
If you don't believe me <i>...</i>

341
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:17,071
Here. Take it.

342
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,671
If you're still interested,
let me know.

343
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,399
I'm sorry. The wind caught it.

344
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:58,953
<i>Please check</i>
<i>the latest Gattaca bulletin.</i>

345
00:49:07,960 --> 00:49:14,433
Jerome. Is this
the approach path we discussed?

346
00:49:15,960 --> 00:49:22,195
- Absolutely, Director.
- Quite right.

347
00:49:36,040 --> 00:49:40,431
Listen, I want what I ordered.

348
00:49:40,600 --> 00:49:45,549
It's a completely different colour.
No. I'm bored of talking to you.

349
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:49,554
I'll call you back.

350
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,191
That was about your hair dye.
They've sent me "Summer wheat".

351
00:49:54,360 --> 00:49:57,238
It's too light.

352
00:49:57,400 --> 00:50:01,234
"why don't you try a change?"
we can't use it!

353
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:07,390
- I'll probably have to pay for it.
- we can't stay here.

354
00:50:07,560 --> 00:50:12,588
- The idiots I have to deal with <i>...!</i>
- They think I killed the director.

355
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:18,279
- what makes them think that?
- They found my eyelash.

356
00:50:20,040 --> 00:50:22,998
- where?
- In the corridor.

357
00:50:23,160 --> 00:50:25,799
Thank God it wasn't in your eye.

358
00:50:25,960 --> 00:50:31,876
My picture is everywhere. I can't
turn around without seeing my face.

359
00:50:32,040 --> 00:50:38,832
- They'll recognize me. They will!
<i>- I</i> don't recognize you.

360
00:50:39,000 --> 00:50:44,757
They won't accept one of their elite
could've suckered them for so long.

361
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:50,916
No, we do as we planned. You're
Jerome Morrow, Navigator 1 st class.

362
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:55,437
I'm not Jerome Morrow.
I'm a murder suspect.

363
00:50:55,600 --> 00:51:00,799
what are you doing?
That's more than a day's worth!

364
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:06,876
- we can't stay here.
- Stop that! Fine <i>...</i> fine!

365
00:51:07,040 --> 00:51:12,558
Leave if you want. But don't
take that stuff. It's mine!

366
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,917
I would've chosen a brave partner -

367
00:51:17,080 --> 00:51:21,915
- if I'd known you'd go
belly-up on me at the last gasp.

368
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,437
You can't quit on me now.

369
00:51:26,600 --> 00:51:31,390
Do you want me to wheel in there
and finish the job myself?

370
00:51:31,560 --> 00:51:38,671
- They are going to find me.
- You still don't understand <i>...</i>

371
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:47,834
when they look at you, they
don't see you any more. Only me.

372
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:04,755
Keep your lashes on your lids
where they belong.

373
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,957
How could you be so careless?

374
00:52:38,400 --> 00:52:41,790
- I'm going out.
- where?

375
00:52:41,960 --> 00:52:45,316
I want some fun before they nail me.

376
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:50,600
- Are you sure that's a good idea?
- You said not to change anything.

377
00:52:50,760 --> 00:52:56,278
- who's going?
- I'd say everybody.

378
00:52:56,440 --> 00:53:00,513
If I don't go
it'll look suspicious.

379
00:53:00,680 --> 00:53:04,514
You don't want to look suspicious,
do you?

380
00:53:07,240 --> 00:53:09,390
Thanks.

381
00:54:06,040 --> 00:54:10,192
who ordered this?
what are we doing here?

382
00:54:10,360 --> 00:54:14,990
I'm following a lead. Forgive me,
but I'm a detective. I follow leads.

383
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:20,598
- why should the suspect be here?
- He's an In-Valid.

384
00:54:20,760 --> 00:54:25,231
- This is where the In-Valids are.
- He's an In-Valid.

385
00:54:25,400 --> 00:54:31,555
He's been in hiding all these years.
You think he'll lie down for us now?

386
00:54:31,720 --> 00:54:35,349
- what do you suggest?
- Go back to the scene.

387
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:38,671
Sweep the area around Gattaca.

388
00:55:00,840 --> 00:55:06,995
- You're a navigator? At Gattaca?
- That's what it says, doesn't it?

389
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:14,236
- It doesn't say you're crippled.
- I hurt my leg training, you moron.

390
00:55:15,480 --> 00:55:21,669
How dare you question me?
what's your number?

391
00:55:21,840 --> 00:55:26,550
- Your number, you fucking flatfoot!
- what do you want? An apology?

392
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:33,319
It gets to you that I can live your
dreams. I'm leaving this dirtball!

393
00:55:33,480 --> 00:55:38,076
- You're harassing me!
- My mistake.

394
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:40,913
what's your number?

395
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:47,309
This is a crime scene.
what's this man doing here?

396
00:55:47,480 --> 00:55:52,235
- what are you doing, old man?
- My job, sir.

397
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:57,918
- This is evidence.
- But it's just trash.

398
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:51,872
You didn't know?
wonderful, wasn't it?

399
00:56:52,880 --> 00:56:56,759
12 fingers or 1, it's how you play.

400
00:56:56,920 --> 00:57:01,869
That piece can only
be played with 12.

401
00:57:16,680 --> 00:57:22,118
- what's all this about?
- It's probably nothing.

402
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:04,310
No. I don't want to give you
a contaminated specimen. Get it?

403
00:58:32,600 --> 00:58:37,799
Thanks. You never know
where those swabs have been.

404
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,833
I want to show you something.

405
00:59:25,520 --> 00:59:28,910
come on, we'll miss it.

406
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,830
come on. we'll miss it.

407
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:45,919
what did I tell you?

408
01:01:03,960 --> 01:01:07,873
Strange. Your eyes look different.

409
01:01:08,040 --> 01:01:13,194
- I guess it must be the light.
- Must be.

410
01:01:34,680 --> 01:01:38,559
Positive match. I'm impressed.

411
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:43,953
- The cup was used recently?
- Two samples, two days.

412
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:48,671
He may have returned to the
crime scene to get a drink of water.

413
01:01:48,840 --> 01:01:52,958
- Or he may still work there.
- we checked all the service staff.

414
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:58,194
I don't think he cleans any more.
I think he's there in disguise.

415
01:01:58,360 --> 01:02:04,629
- A borrowed ladder at Gattaca?
- Far-fetched, but not impossible.

416
01:02:04,800 --> 01:02:11,638
He can't be among the elite. He's
mentally and physically inferior.

417
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:17,397
Maybe he is an imposter
and maybe the director found out.

418
01:02:17,560 --> 01:02:20,677
Let's sample every employee
intravenously.

419
01:02:20,840 --> 01:02:27,393
we'd close them down for days. No,
take a fingertip or a urine sample.

420
01:02:27,560 --> 01:02:32,156
I suggest blood from the vein.
I hope I'm not out of line.

421
01:02:59,240 --> 01:03:02,755
It's only a matter of time, sir.

422
01:03:06,120 --> 01:03:12,753
what's with the plungers, Lamar?
You open up a blood bank?

423
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:20,270
The detectives fear my methods
may have been compromised.

424
01:03:32,200 --> 01:03:38,435
- Goddamn! Are you out of practice?
- Let me look at that.

425
01:03:38,600 --> 01:03:42,593
- It's all right.
- Luckily, we have enough.

426
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:47,629
If you need any more,
you can get it off his shoes.

427
01:04:01,120 --> 01:04:04,112
Irene.

428
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:12,310
- So you didn't do it after all?
- I guess someone beat me to it.

429
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:15,552
I guess.

430
01:04:20,600 --> 01:04:23,478
I leave in two days.

431
01:04:25,560 --> 01:04:29,075
I guess you know that. But <i>...</i>

432
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:43,958
That's the last.

433
01:04:44,120 --> 01:04:47,192
- Something's wrong.
- He's not here.

434
01:04:47,360 --> 01:04:54,357
- I say we test again.
- No. No more disruptions.

435
01:04:54,520 --> 01:05:00,834
- You have a murderer in your midst.
- Your presence is more of a threat.

436
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:05,676
The window for our latest launch is
open for seven days every 70 years.

437
01:05:05,840 --> 01:05:11,790
- It's crucial we leave on time.
- This mission means a lot to you.

438
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:15,236
Your late colleague opposed it.

439
01:05:15,400 --> 01:05:20,952
Take another look at my profile.
I haven't a violent bone in my body.

440
01:05:21,120 --> 01:05:25,796
My apologies.
He won't trouble you any further.

441
01:05:25,960 --> 01:05:30,636
This is not the only place
we can look.

442
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,316
Let's start making the rounds.

443
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:38,433
I'm luckier than most.
Not as lucky as some.

444
01:06:40,760 --> 01:06:46,790
- I know something about that.
- what heart problem have you had?

445
01:06:46,960 --> 01:06:50,555
Did you get yours broken once?

446
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:59,430
I had this crazy idea you were more
interested in the murder than in me.

447
01:07:00,760 --> 01:07:03,752
You're right.

448
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:08,756
That's a crazy idea.

449
01:07:10,600 --> 01:07:13,910
would you like to dance?

450
01:07:47,640 --> 01:07:53,670
It's funny. You work so hard
to get away from a place <i>...</i>

451
01:07:54,560 --> 01:08:01,557
And when you finally get to leave,
you find a reason to stay.

452
01:08:06,280 --> 01:08:11,957
- A year is a long time.
- Not so long.

453
01:08:12,120 --> 01:08:16,113
Just once around the sun.

454
01:08:23,360 --> 01:08:28,753
Hello, I'm your detective
for the evening. Please stay here.

455
01:08:30,080 --> 01:08:34,915
Don't leave! Am I speaking
in some strange foreign language?

456
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:40,791
check lenses, dentures, napkins,
cigarette butts, saliva off cups.

457
01:08:42,280 --> 01:08:46,717
That's a familiar face.
check him out.

458
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:54,510
- I thought you wanted to dance.
- where are you going?

459
01:08:55,000 --> 01:08:57,878
Jerome!

460
01:09:06,360 --> 01:09:09,796
- Are you insane?
- come on!

461
01:09:26,520 --> 01:09:28,431
where did they go?

462
01:09:34,200 --> 01:09:37,078
come on.

463
01:09:47,200 --> 01:09:50,636
- I can't do that!
- You just did.

464
01:09:51,480 --> 01:09:56,474
Don't touch your face.
Don't swallow. clean his teeth.

465
01:10:00,320 --> 01:10:02,709
Vincent!

466
01:10:06,040 --> 01:10:09,350
Vincent!

467
01:10:14,240 --> 01:10:17,198
who's Vincent?

468
01:10:21,200 --> 01:10:23,714
I <i>...</i>

469
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:30,197
Don't say anything.

470
01:10:30,360 --> 01:10:33,477
Don't say anything.

471
01:13:18,480 --> 01:13:21,233
what happened?

472
01:13:23,520 --> 01:13:27,308
The scars on your legs?

473
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:33,036
Remember the '99 chrysler LeBaron?

474
01:13:33,200 --> 01:13:39,150
I bumped into the front fender.
Looked left instead of right.

475
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:48,038
- Is that the new or the old excuse?
- The old one.

476
01:13:49,560 --> 01:13:54,315
- You are involved with the murder.
- That's not true, Irene.

477
01:14:03,280 --> 01:14:06,795
Isn't that the man from last night?

478
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,876
He's nobody.

479
01:14:19,440 --> 01:14:26,312
He's one of our best. He has nothing
to do with this business.

480
01:14:27,560 --> 01:14:30,358
Jerome Morrow.

481
01:14:38,160 --> 01:14:43,712
You don't look well, Jerome.
why don't you go home?

482
01:14:53,840 --> 01:14:56,593
- Yes?
- Jerome Morrow.

483
01:14:56,760 --> 01:15:01,788
He's ill. A little nausea.
It's quite common before a mission.

484
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:07,318
I want to visit him. I understand
you can show me the way.

485
01:15:49,000 --> 01:15:52,834
You don't know who he is, do you?

486
01:16:09,240 --> 01:16:13,028
- Hello?
- Be yourself today.

487
01:16:13,200 --> 01:16:18,399
- I was never very good at it.
- Tell the investigators you're ill.

488
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:22,838
- How long have I got?
<i>- Not long.</i>

489
01:18:07,120 --> 01:18:10,510
I guess he's not home.

490
01:18:12,680 --> 01:18:16,958
- I'm here to see Jerome Morrow.
- That's me. come up.

491
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:20,749
I guess he's home.

492
01:18:53,240 --> 01:18:55,080
come in.

493
01:18:55,080 --> 01:18:56,991
come in.

494
01:18:57,160 --> 01:19:00,789
come in.

495
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:04,111
Hello, sweetheart.

496
01:19:05,280 --> 01:19:09,068
where's my kiss?

497
01:19:10,080 --> 01:19:17,509
- Good to see you're feeling better.
- Of course, now that you're here.

498
01:19:25,640 --> 01:19:30,316
who's your friend? How can I help?

499
01:19:30,480 --> 01:19:34,359
- It's about the director.
- Again?

500
01:19:34,520 --> 01:19:38,035
- I hope it's no trouble.
- No, no.

501
01:19:38,200 --> 01:19:42,273
- I won't show you around. Sorry.
- can't we do this another time?

502
01:19:42,440 --> 01:19:48,436
- This won't take a moment.
- Maybe he can tell me why I'm ill.

503
01:20:22,640 --> 01:20:26,553
who were you expecting?

504
01:21:06,520 --> 01:21:12,197
<i>- we have our man in custody.</i>
- I'll come right away.

505
01:21:33,920 --> 01:21:39,278
- How are you, Jerome?
- Not bad, Jerome.

506
01:21:40,680 --> 01:21:45,879
- How the hell did you get up here?
- I can walk. I've been faking it.

507
01:22:01,760 --> 01:22:04,593
Irene <i>...</i>

508
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:08,275
Don't touch me!
I don't even know who you are.

509
01:22:08,440 --> 01:22:13,389
- I'm the same as I was yesterday.
- No more lies, Jerome.

510
01:22:13,560 --> 01:22:17,235
My name is Vincent Anton Freeman.

511
01:22:17,400 --> 01:22:23,157
I'm a faith birth or a de-gene-erate
or whatever. But I'm not a murderer.

512
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:30,278
- You're a God-child?
- we do have one thing in common.

513
01:22:30,440 --> 01:22:35,798
Only I don't have 20-30 years left
in mine. It's 10,000 beats overdue.

514
01:22:35,960 --> 01:22:41,080
- It's not possible.
- You know what isn't possible.

515
01:22:41,240 --> 01:22:44,789
Don't you, Irene?

516
01:22:44,960 --> 01:22:50,034
They've got you looking so hard for
any flaw, that that's all you see.

517
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:58,160
For whatever it's worth, I'm here
to tell you that it is possible.

518
01:22:59,240 --> 01:23:02,869
It is possible.

519
01:23:38,520 --> 01:23:45,198
congratulations, sir. His spit was
found in the dead director's eye.

520
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:51,469
while I obsessed over an eyelash,
your instincts pointed the way.

521
01:23:51,640 --> 01:23:54,712
So the In-Valid wasn't involved?

522
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,829
No, our friend acted alone. This
mission meant everything to him.

523
01:24:03,200 --> 01:24:06,988
He'll only live to see this launch.

524
01:24:07,160 --> 01:24:12,632
Since nothing can stop the launch
now, he's very, very cooperative.

525
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:22,199
- So, will you celebrate tonight?
- Of course.

526
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:44,113
- I think she likes us.
- In time she'll get used to it.

527
01:24:44,280 --> 01:24:47,795
- what was he like?
- Just a cop.

528
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,997
- Did you get his name?
- No.

529
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:54,914
- He'll be back.
- They have their man. It's over.

530
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:58,436
No, it's not. I have to meet him.

531
01:25:24,600 --> 01:25:27,160
Vincent?

532
01:25:35,640 --> 01:25:38,950
My God, you have changed.

533
01:25:41,080 --> 01:25:45,710
- Don't you recognize your brother?
- Are we brothers?

534
01:25:45,880 --> 01:25:51,637
Our parents died thinking they'd
outlived you. I had my doubts.

535
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:57,714
- what are you doing here?
<i>- I</i> have a right to be here.

536
01:25:58,640 --> 01:26:04,397
- You don't.
- You sound as if you believe that.

537
01:26:04,560 --> 01:26:09,111
I committed no murder.
You must be disappointed.

538
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:16,030
You committed fraud. You're in
trouble. I can get you out of here.

539
01:26:16,200 --> 01:26:21,479
- I've struggled to get here!
- You've gone as far as you can go.

540
01:26:22,440 --> 01:26:25,477
There's still a million miles to go.

541
01:26:25,640 --> 01:26:29,076
can you only succeed
by seeing me fail?

542
01:26:29,240 --> 01:26:34,678
God! Even you are going to tell me
what I can and can't do now?

543
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:41,154
I don't need any rescuing.
But you did, once.

544
01:26:43,160 --> 01:26:49,554
- How do you explain that?
- You didn't beat me. I beat myself.

545
01:26:51,400 --> 01:26:55,473
- who are you trying to convince?
- Do you want me to prove it?

546
01:26:56,360 --> 01:27:01,115
It's not important, Anton.
It's forgotten.

547
01:27:01,280 --> 01:27:05,193
I'll prove it to you.
Do you want me to prove it?

548
01:27:05,360 --> 01:27:06,918
I do.

549
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,309
Vincent!

550
01:28:12,880 --> 01:28:16,759
Vincent! where's the shore?
we're too far out!

551
01:28:16,920 --> 01:28:19,957
Do you want to quit? Do you?

552
01:28:21,720 --> 01:28:24,109
No.

553
01:28:45,120 --> 01:28:50,274
Vincent!
How are you doing this, Vincent?

554
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,874
How have you done any of this?
we have to go back.

555
01:28:55,040 --> 01:29:00,592
- No. we're close to the other side.
- Do you want to drown us both?

556
01:29:02,000 --> 01:29:04,639
You want to know how I did it?

557
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:10,511
This is how I did it. I never
saved anything for the swim back.

558
01:30:49,720 --> 01:30:55,113
You couldn't see, could you?
That night, crossing the street.

559
01:30:56,720 --> 01:31:00,474
You crossed anyway.

560
01:31:13,600 --> 01:31:18,674
If you're still interested,
let me know.

561
01:31:23,840 --> 01:31:26,718
Sorry <i>...</i>

562
01:31:29,640 --> 01:31:33,997
The wind caught it.

563
01:32:23,320 --> 01:32:29,077
You're flying today, aren't you?
Look at what a mess you're in.

564
01:32:31,480 --> 01:32:37,510
- I have your samples ready.
- I don't need any where I'm going.

565
01:32:41,680 --> 01:32:44,990
You might when you get back.

566
01:32:47,000 --> 01:32:51,437
Everything you need
to last you two lifetimes.

567
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:58,711
- why have you done all this?
- So Jerome will always be here.

568
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:03,795
- where are you going?
- I'm travelling, too.

569
01:33:05,920 --> 01:33:11,790
- I don't know how to thank you.
- No, no <i>...</i>

570
01:33:11,960 --> 01:33:17,637
I got the better end of the deal.
I only lent you my body.

571
01:33:17,800 --> 01:33:21,509
You lent me your dream.

572
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:33,712
Not until you're upstairs.

573
01:34:03,920 --> 01:34:08,118
- what is this?
- New policy.

574
01:34:13,560 --> 01:34:18,315
- Flight got you nervous?
- There's a problem, Lamar.

575
01:34:18,480 --> 01:34:24,191
I never did tell you about my son,
did I? He's a big fan of yours.

576
01:34:27,080 --> 01:34:32,438
Just remember that I was as good
as any and better than most.

577
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:38,436
- He wants to apply here.
- I could have gone up and back.

578
01:34:39,240 --> 01:34:44,394
Unfortunately, my son's
not all that they promised.

579
01:34:44,560 --> 01:34:49,076
But then,
who knows what he could do?

580
01:34:49,240 --> 01:34:52,198
Right?

581
01:35:05,960 --> 01:35:11,990
For future reference, right-handed
men don't hold it with their left.

582
01:35:12,160 --> 01:35:15,948
Just one of those things.

583
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:31,588
You're going to miss your flight,
Vincent.

584
01:38:08,280 --> 01:38:12,432
<i>For someone who was never meant</i>
<i>for this world,</i> <i>-</i>

585
01:38:12,600 --> 01:38:17,071
<i>- I'm suddenly having a hard time</i>
<i>leaving it.</i>

586
01:38:17,240 --> 01:38:22,189
<i>Of course, they say every atom in</i>
<i>our bodies was once part of a star.</i>

587
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:28,196
<i>Maybe I'm not leaving.</i>
<i>Maybe I'm going home.</i>
