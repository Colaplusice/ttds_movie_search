1
00:00:34,540 --> 00:00:36,940
Forget it. It's too risky.

2
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:38,500
I'm through doing that shit.

3
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:40,940
You always say that,
the same thing every time.

4
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,540
"I'm through, never again,
too dangerous."

5
00:00:43,580 --> 00:00:46,020
I know that's what I always say.
I'm always right, too.

6
00:00:46,060 --> 00:00:47,900
But you forget about it
in a day or two.

7
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:49,340
Well, the days of me
forgetting are over...

8
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:51,500
and the days of me remembering
have just begun.

9
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,820
You know when you go on
like this what you sound like?

10
00:00:53,860 --> 00:00:55,860
I sound like
a sensible fucking man.

11
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,780
You sound like a duck.
Quack, quack, quack...

12
00:00:57,820 --> 00:00:59,700
Take heart, 'cause you're never
gonna have to hear it again...

13
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:01,420
since I'm never
gonna do it again...

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,620
you're never gonna
have to hear me quack...

15
00:01:02,660 --> 00:01:04,020
about how I'm never
gonna do it again.

16
00:01:04,060 --> 00:01:05,100
After tonight.

17
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:07,220
Correct.
I got all tonight to quack.

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:09,740
Can I get anyone more coffee?

19
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,820
Oh, yes. Thank you.

20
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,300
You're welcome.

21
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:17,980
I mean, the way it is now...

22
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:20,860
you're taking the same risk
as when you rob a bank.

23
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,820
You take more of a risk.
Banks are easier.

24
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,260
Federal banks
ain't supposed to stop you...

25
00:01:24,340 --> 00:01:25,700
in any way during a robbery.

26
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,660
They're insured.
Why should they give a fuck?

27
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:30,220
You don't even need a gun
in a federal bank.

28
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:31,660
I heard about
this one bloke...

29
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:33,500
He walks into a bank
with a portable phone.

30
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,060
He gives the phone
to the teller...

31
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:36,500
bloke on the other end
of the phone says...

32
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:37,900
"We got this guy's little girl.

33
00:01:37,940 --> 00:01:39,380
"If you don't give him
all your money...

34
00:01:39,380 --> 00:01:40,980
- "we're gonna kill her."
- Did it work?

35
00:01:41,020 --> 00:01:43,420
Fucking way, it works.
That's what I'm talking about!

36
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,380
Knucklehead walks into a bank
with a telephone...

37
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:47,260
not a pistol, not a shotgun...

38
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:49,180
a fucking phone.
Cleans the place out.

39
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,940
They don't even lift
a fucking finger.

40
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:52,540
Did they hurt the little girl?

41
00:01:52,580 --> 00:01:55,420
I don't know. Probably never was
a girl in the first place.

42
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:57,700
The point isn't the girl.
The point is...

43
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:59,460
they robbed a bank
with a telephone.

44
00:01:59,500 --> 00:02:01,100
You want to rob banks?

45
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:02,260
I'm not saying
I want to rob banks.

46
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:04,820
If we did, it would be easier
than what we been doing.

47
00:02:04,860 --> 00:02:06,220
No more liquor stores?

48
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:08,860
What we been talking about?
Yeah, no more liquor stores.

49
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,340
Besides, it ain't the giggle
it used to be.

50
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:11,940
There's too many foreigners
own liquor stores.

51
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:13,780
Vietnamese, Koreans, they don't
even speak fucking English.

52
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:15,140
You tell 'em,
"Empty out the register..."

53
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:16,540
they don't know what the fuck
you're talking about.

54
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:17,820
They make it too personal.

55
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:19,820
We keep on, one of these gook
fucker's gonna make us kill him.

56
00:02:19,860 --> 00:02:21,620
I'm not gonna kill anybody.

57
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:23,340
I don't want to kill anybody,
either.

58
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,900
But they'll probably
put us in a situation...

59
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:26,580
where it's us or them.

60
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:28,780
And if it's not the gooks,
it's these old fucking Jews...

61
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,860
who've owned the store
for fifteen fucking generations.

62
00:02:30,900 --> 00:02:33,580
You got Grandpa Irving
sitting behind the counter...

63
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,020
with a fucking Magnum
in his hand.

64
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:37,100
Try walking into one of those
places with nothing but a phone.

65
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,340
See how far that gets you.
Fuck it. We're out of it.

66
00:02:39,380 --> 00:02:41,700
Yeah, well, what then?
Day jobs?

67
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:43,820
- Not in this life.
- What, then?

68
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:47,700
Garcon! Coffee!

69
00:02:47,740 --> 00:02:49,100
This place.

70
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,260
Garcon means "boy."

71
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,380
This place? A coffee shop?

72
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,900
What's wrong with that?

73
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:06,860
Nobody ever robs restaurants.
Why not?

74
00:03:06,860 --> 00:03:11,220
Bars, liquor stores,
gas stations...

75
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,460
you get your head blown off
sticking up one of them.

76
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,940
Restaurants, on the other hand,
you catch with their pants down.

77
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:18,860
They're not expecting
to get robbed.

78
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,340
Not as expecting, anyway.

79
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:23,060
I bet you could
cut down on the hero factor...

80
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:24,340
in a place like this.

81
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:25,380
Correct.

82
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,380
Same as banks,
these places are insured.

83
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:30,740
Manager... he don't give a fuck.

84
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,180
He's just trying
to get you out the door...

85
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:33,620
before you start
plugging the diners.

86
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:35,140
Waitresses? Fucking forget it.

87
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:37,260
No way they're taking a bullet
for the register.

88
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:40,500
Busboys, some wetback
getting paid $1.50 an hour...

89
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,940
really give a fuck
you're stealing from the owner?

90
00:03:42,980 --> 00:03:44,900
Customers sitting
with food in their mouths.

91
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:45,980
They don't know
what's going on.

92
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,460
One minute they're
having a Denver omelette...

93
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,380
next minute, someone's
sticking a gun in their face.

94
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,780
See, I got the idea...

95
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:55,060
last liquor store we stuck up.
Remember?

96
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,620
All the customers
kept coming in?

97
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,100
Yeah.

98
00:03:58,140 --> 00:03:59,860
You got the idea
taking their wallets.

99
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,860
Mm-hmm.
- Now, that was a good idea.

100
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:03,300
Thank you.

101
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:04,940
Made more from the wallets
than we did from the register.

102
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,460
Yes, we did.
- People come to restaurants.

103
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:09,060
A lot of wallets.

104
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,980
Pretty smart, huh?

105
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:13,060
Pretty smart.

106
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,380
I'm ready. Let's do it.
Right now, right here.

107
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:20,140
Come on.
- All right.

108
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:21,820
Same as last time, remember?

109
00:04:21,820 --> 00:04:24,540
You're crowd control.
I handle employees.

110
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:31,220
I love you, Pumpkin.

111
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:32,900
I love you, Honey Bunny.

112
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:35,980
Everybody, be cool!
This is a robbery!

113
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,100
Any of you
fucking pricks move...

114
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,700
and I'll execute every
motherfucking last one of you!

115
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,900
Ha ha ha

116
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,180
Jungle boogie,
Jungle boogie

117
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:36,300
- Get it on
- Jungle boogie

118
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,540
- Jungle boogie
- Get it on

119
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,580
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the boogie

120
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:42,820
- Jungle boogie
- Get up with the get down

121
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:44,860
- Jungle boogie
- Get down with the boogie

122
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:47,340
- Jungle boogie
- Come and shake it around

123
00:06:55,220 --> 00:06:56,940
OK, so tell me again
about the hash bars.

124
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:59,620
- OK. What you want to know?
- Hash is legal there, right?

125
00:06:59,660 --> 00:07:01,140
Yeah, it's legal,
but it ain't 100% legal.

126
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:03,540
You just can't walk
into a restaurant...

127
00:07:03,580 --> 00:07:05,500
roll a joint,
and start puffing away.

128
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,100
I mean, they want you to smoke
in your home...

129
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,940
- or certain designated places.
- And those are hash bars?

130
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,380
Yeah, it breaks down like this.

131
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:13,780
It's legal to buy it,
it's legal to own it...

132
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:15,820
and if you're the proprietor
of a hash bar...

133
00:07:15,860 --> 00:07:17,260
it's legal to sell it.

134
00:07:17,260 --> 00:07:19,620
It's legal to carry it,
but... but that doesn't matter...

135
00:07:19,660 --> 00:07:21,300
'cause, get a load of this,
all right?

136
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,460
If you get stopped by a cop
in Amsterdam...

137
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,180
it's illegal
for them to search you.

138
00:07:25,220 --> 00:07:27,900
I mean, that's a right the cops
in Amsterdam don't have.

139
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:30,340
Oh, man, I'm going.
That's all there is to it.

140
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,820
I'm fucking going.

141
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:33,700
I know, baby.
You'd dig it the most.

142
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,940
But you know what the funniest
thing about Europe is?

143
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,900
- What?
- It's the little differences.

144
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,180
I mean, they got the same shit
over there that they got here...

145
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,460
but it's just
a little different.

146
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,020
Example?

147
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,820
You can go to a movie theater
in Amsterdam and buy a beer.

148
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:49,620
And I don't mean just, like,
in no paper cup.

149
00:07:49,660 --> 00:07:51,340
I'm talking about
a glass of beer.

150
00:07:51,380 --> 00:07:53,900
And in Paris, you can
buy a beer at McDonald's.

151
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:55,340
And you know what they call...

152
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:58,820
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in Paris?

153
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:00,420
They don't call it
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese?

154
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:01,940
No, man, they got
the metric system there.

155
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:03,740
They wouldn't know what the fuck
a Quarter-Pounder is.

156
00:08:03,740 --> 00:08:05,140
What do they call it?

157
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:07,500
They call it
a "Royale with Cheese."

158
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:09,620
- "Royale with Cheese."
That's right.

159
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,100
What do they call a Big Mac?

160
00:08:11,140 --> 00:08:14,140
Big Mac's a Big Mac,
but they call it "Le Big Mac."

161
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,900
"Le Big Mac." Ha ha ha ha.

162
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:18,380
What do they call a Whopper?

163
00:08:18,420 --> 00:08:20,940
I don't know.
I didn't go into Burger King.

164
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:22,820
You know what they put on
French fries in Holland...

165
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,740
- instead of ketchup?
- What?

166
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:26,660
- Mayonnaise.
- Goddamn!

167
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:28,580
Ha ha ha.
I've seen 'em do it, man.

168
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,180
They fucking drown 'em
in that shit.

169
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,820
Yuck.

170
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,980
We should have shotguns
for this kind of deal.

171
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,860
- How many up there?
- Three or four.

172
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,780
That's counting our guy?

173
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:46,420
I'm not sure.

174
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:48,780
So that means it could be
up to five guys up there?

175
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:50,580
It's possible.

176
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
We should have fucking shotguns.

177
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,660
What's her name?
Mia.

178
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:57,580
Mia. How did Marsellus
and her meet?

179
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:00,700
I don't know.
However people meet people.

180
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,300
She used to be an actress.

181
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:04,660
Oh, really? She do anything
I'd have seen?

182
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:07,460
I think her biggest deal
was she starred in a pilot.

183
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,940
Pilot? What's a pilot?

184
00:09:09,020 --> 00:09:11,100
Well, you know the shows on TV?

185
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,500
I don't watch TV.

186
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:14,260
Yeah, but you are aware...

187
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,900
that there's an invention
called television...

188
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,100
and on this invention
they show shows, right?

189
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:19,180
Yeah.

190
00:09:19,220 --> 00:09:22,060
The way they pick TV shows,
they make one show.

191
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:23,460
That show's called a pilot.

192
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,780
Then they show that one show
to the people who pick shows...

193
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:27,180
and on the strength
of that one show...

194
00:09:27,220 --> 00:09:28,980
they decide if they want
to make more shows.

195
00:09:29,020 --> 00:09:31,540
Some get chosen
and become television programs.

196
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,100
Some don't, become nothing.

197
00:09:34,140 --> 00:09:36,900
She starred in one of the ones
that became nothing.

198
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:41,020
You remember Antwan Rockamora?
Half-black, half-Samoan...

199
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,100
used to call him
"Tony Rocky Horror"?

200
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:44,740
Yeah, maybe. Fat, right?

201
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,540
I wouldn't go so far
as to call the brother fat.

202
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,980
I mean, he got a weight problem.

203
00:09:47,980 --> 00:09:49,420
What's the nigger gonna do,
he's Samoan.

204
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:51,460
Yeah, I think I know
who you mean. What about him?

205
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,620
Well,
Marsellus fucked him up good.

206
00:09:53,660 --> 00:09:55,100
Word around the campfire is...

207
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:57,260
it was on account
of Marsellus Wallace's wife.

208
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:07,060
So, what'd he do, fuck her?

209
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,380
No, no, no, no, no.
Nothing that bad.

210
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,980
Well, then, what, then?

211
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,820
Gave her a foot massage.

212
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:19,180
- A foot massage? That's it?
- Mm-hmm.

213
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,340
Then what did Marsellus do?

214
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,060
Sent a couple of cats
over to his place.

215
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:26,140
They took him out on his patio,
threw his ass over the balcony.

216
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:28,100
Nigger fell four stories.

217
00:10:28,140 --> 00:10:29,980
They had a little garden
down at the bottom...

218
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,140
enclosed in glass,
like a greenhouse.

219
00:10:32,180 --> 00:10:34,340
Nigger fell through that.

220
00:10:34,380 --> 00:10:37,340
Since then, he kind of
developed a speech impediment.

221
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:40,140
That's a damn shame.

222
00:10:45,860 --> 00:10:47,300
But still, I have to say...

223
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:49,020
you play with matches,
you get burned.

224
00:10:49,060 --> 00:10:50,180
What do you mean?

225
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:52,260
You don't be giving
Marsellus Wallace's new bride...

226
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:53,580
a foot massage.

227
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:55,180
You don't think he overreacted?

228
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,500
Well, Antwan probably
didn't expect Marsellus...

229
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:00,860
to react the way he did,
but he had to expect a reaction.

230
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:02,980
It was a foot massage.
A foot massage is nothing.

231
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:04,500
I give my mother a foot massage.

232
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,500
No, it's laying hands
in a familiar way...

233
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:08,220
on Marsellus' new wife.

234
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,740
I mean, is it as bad
as eating her pussy out?

235
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:12,980
No, but it's
the same fucking ballpark.

236
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,460
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
stop right there.

237
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:16,500
Eating a bitch out and giving
a bitch a foot massage...

238
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,940
ain't even
the same fucking thing.

239
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,580
It's not.
It's the same ballpark.

240
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:21,540
Ain't no fucking ballpark,
neither.

241
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:24,580
Now, look, maybe your method
of massage differs from mine...

242
00:11:24,620 --> 00:11:26,300
but you know
touching his wife's feet...

243
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:28,020
and sticking your tongue
in her holiest of holies...

244
00:11:28,060 --> 00:11:30,620
ain't the same fucking ballpark.
It ain't the same league.

245
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,100
It ain't even
the same fucking sport.

246
00:11:32,180 --> 00:11:34,300
Look,
foot massages don't mean shit.

247
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:36,260
Have you ever given
a foot massage?

248
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:39,140
Don't be telling me
about foot massages.

249
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,620
I'm the foot fucking master.

250
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:42,620
- You given a lot of 'em?
- Shit, yeah.

251
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:44,060
Got my technique down
and everything.

252
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,740
I don't be tickling or nothing.

253
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,180
Would you give a guy
a foot massage?

254
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,380
Fuck you.

255
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:55,140
- You given 'em a lot?
- Fuck you.

256
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,620
You know, I'm kind of tired.

257
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:58,020
I could use
a foot massage myself.

258
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,500
Yo, yo, yo, man.
You best back off.

259
00:11:59,540 --> 00:12:01,020
I'm getting
a little pissed here.

260
00:12:02,740 --> 00:12:04,860
- This is the door.
- There it is.

261
00:12:08,020 --> 00:12:09,340
What time you got?

262
00:12:10,420 --> 00:12:12,660
7:22 in the a.m.

263
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:16,140
No, it ain't quite time yet.
Come on. Let's hang back.

264
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:26,340
Just 'cause I wouldn't give
no man a foot massage...

265
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:27,540
don't make it right
for Marsellus...

266
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,820
to throw Antwan
off a building...

267
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,260
into a glass
motherfucking house...

268
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:32,700
fucking up the way the nigger
talks. That shit ain't right.

269
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:35,100
Motherfucker do that shit to me,
he better paralyze my ass...

270
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,420
'cause I'd kill
the motherfucker...

271
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:38,340
- you know what I'm saying?
- I ain't saying it's right.

272
00:12:38,380 --> 00:12:40,180
But you're saying a foot massage
don't mean nothing...

273
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,700
and I'm saying it does.

274
00:12:41,740 --> 00:12:44,460
I've given a million ladies
a million foot massages...

275
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:46,060
and they all meant something.

276
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:48,020
Now, we act like they don't,
but they do.

277
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:49,820
That's what's so fucking cool
about 'em.

278
00:12:49,860 --> 00:12:52,300
There's a sensuous thing
going on where, you know...

279
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:55,140
you don't talk about it, but you
know it, and she knows it.

280
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,900
Fucking Marsellus knew it...

281
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:59,860
and Antwan should've fucking
better known better.

282
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:01,580
I mean,
that's his fucking wife, man.

283
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,220
This ain't a man with a sense
of humor about this shit.

284
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,700
You know what I'm saying?

285
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:09,060
It's an interesting point.

286
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:11,100
Come on.
Let's get into character.

287
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,420
What's her name again?

288
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:20,180
- Mia.
- Mia.

289
00:13:20,220 --> 00:13:22,340
Why you so interested
in big man's wife?

290
00:13:22,340 --> 00:13:24,020
Well, he's going out of town,
Florida...

291
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,540
and he asked me if I'd take care
of her while he's gone.

292
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:30,620
- Take care of her?
- No, man. Just take her out.

293
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:34,460
You know, show her a good time.
Make sure she don't get lonely.

294
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,180
You're gonna be taking
Mia Wallace out on a date?

295
00:13:37,220 --> 00:13:39,260
It is not a date.

296
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:42,180
It's just like if you were going
to take your buddy's wife...

297
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,700
to a movie or something.

298
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:45,660
It's just good company,
that's all.

299
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:54,140
It's not a date.
It's definitely not a date.

300
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:05,700
Hey, kids. How you boys doing?

301
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:07,140
Hey, keep chilling.

302
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:15,940
You know who we are?

303
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:19,460
We're associates
of your business partner...

304
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,180
Marsellus Wallace.

305
00:14:21,180 --> 00:14:23,780
You do remember your business
partner, don't you?

306
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,820
Let me take a wild guess here.

307
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:34,060
- You're Brett, right?
- Yeah.

308
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,660
I thought so.

309
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:38,140
You remember your business
partner Marsellus Wallace...

310
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,300
don't you, Brett?

311
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:41,780
Yeah, I remember him.

312
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,140
Good.

313
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,860
Looks like me and Vincent
caught you boys at breakfast.

314
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:48,220
Sorry about that.
What you having?

315
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,940
- Hamburgers.
- Hamburgers!

316
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:54,540
The cornerstone
of any nutritious breakfast.

317
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,620
What kind of hamburgers?

318
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,500
Ch-ch-cheeseburgers.

319
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:00,940
No, no, no, no.
Where'd you get 'em?

320
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:03,340
McDonald's, Wendy's,
Jack-in-the-Box, where?

321
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:05,580
Um, Big Kahuna Burger.

322
00:15:05,620 --> 00:15:08,380
Big Kahuna Burger. That's
that Hawaiian burger joint.

323
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:10,420
I hear they got
some tasty burgers.

324
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:12,500
I ain't never had one myself.
How are they?

325
00:15:13,540 --> 00:15:14,940
They're good.

326
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:17,740
You mind if I try one of yours?

327
00:15:17,740 --> 00:15:20,140
- This is yours here, right?
- Yeah.

328
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:32,220
Mmm! This is a tasty burger.

329
00:15:32,260 --> 00:15:34,780
Vincent, you ever had
a Big Kahuna Burger?

330
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,340
Want a bite?
They're real tasty.

331
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,580
I ain't hungry.

332
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:42,100
If you like burgers,
give 'em a try sometime.

333
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:44,340
Me, I can't usually get 'em...

334
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:45,980
'cause my girlfriend's
a vegetarian...

335
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,980
which pretty much makes me
a vegetarian...

336
00:15:49,020 --> 00:15:52,860
But I do love the taste
of a good burger. Mmm.

337
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,300
You know what they call...

338
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:56,540
a Quarter-Pounder with Cheese
in France?

339
00:15:56,580 --> 00:15:58,540
- No.
- Tell him, Vincent.

340
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:00,580
Royale with Cheese.

341
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,700
Royale with Cheese.
You know why they call it that?

342
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:09,740
Because of the metric system?

343
00:16:09,780 --> 00:16:12,820
Check out the big brain
on Brett!

344
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:16,340
You're a smart motherfucker.
That's right. The metric system.

345
00:16:18,140 --> 00:16:19,860
What's in this?

346
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:22,140
- Sprite.
- Sprite, good.

347
00:16:22,180 --> 00:16:24,500
You mind if I have
some of your tasty beverage...

348
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:26,260
to wash this down with?

349
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:27,700
Go right ahead.

350
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,260
Ahh.

351
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:41,300
That hit the spot.

352
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:46,420
You, Flock of Seagulls.
You know why we're here?

353
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,940
Why don't you tell
my man Vince here...

354
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:50,220
- where you got the shit hid at?
It's over there.

355
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,780
I don't remember asking you
a goddamn thing!

356
00:16:58,060 --> 00:17:01,100
- You were saying?
- It's in the cupboard.

357
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:06,020
N-no.
The one by your kn-knees.

358
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,780
We happy?

359
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:32,260
Vincent? We happy?

360
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:36,020
Yeah, we happy.
Pbbbt.

361
00:17:36,060 --> 00:17:40,420
Look... I'm sorry, uh,
I... I didn't get your name.

362
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,620
I got yours. Uh, Vincent, right?
But... but I... I never got yours.

363
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,900
My name's Pitt...

364
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:47,180
and your ass ain't talking
your way out of this shit.

365
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:48,620
No, no, no.

366
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:51,900
I just want you to know how...

367
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:57,100
I just want you to know
how sorry we are...

368
00:17:57,140 --> 00:18:00,460
that things got so fucked up
with us and... and Mr. Wallace.

369
00:18:00,500 --> 00:18:03,940
W-we got into this thing with
the best intentions. I never...

370
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:08,700
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I break your concentration?

371
00:18:08,740 --> 00:18:12,820
I didn't mean
to do that. Please, continue.

372
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:17,300
You were saying something
about "best intentions."

373
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,420
What's the matter?
Oh, y-you were finished?

374
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:23,740
Oh, well, allow me to retort.

375
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:30,340
What does Marsellus Wallace
look like?

376
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:32,500
What?

377
00:18:32,540 --> 00:18:34,180
What country are you from?

378
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,700
Wh-what?

379
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:37,220
"What" ain't no country
I ever heard of!

380
00:18:37,260 --> 00:18:39,860
- They speak English in "What"?
- Wh-what?

381
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,340
English, motherfucker!
Do you speak it?

382
00:18:41,380 --> 00:18:42,780
Yes!

383
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,220
- Then you know what I'm saying.
- Yes!

384
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:47,620
Describe what Marsellus Wallace
looks like!

385
00:18:47,660 --> 00:18:49,340
What? I...

386
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,900
Say "what" again!
Say "what" again!

387
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:53,980
I dare you!
I double-dare you, motherfucker!

388
00:18:54,020 --> 00:18:56,020
Say "what"
one more goddamn time!

389
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,780
H-h-he's black.

390
00:18:57,820 --> 00:19:00,180
- Go on!
- He's bald.

391
00:19:00,220 --> 00:19:02,780
- Does he look like a bitch?
- What?

392
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,460
Oww! Aah!

393
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:09,260
- Does he look like a bitch?
- No!

394
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,420
Then why you try to fuck him
like a bitch, Brett?

395
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:12,820
- I didn't.
- Yes, you did.

396
00:19:12,860 --> 00:19:15,060
Yes, you did, Brett!

397
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:17,220
You tried to fuck him.
- No.

398
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,940
Marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked...

399
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:21,980
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

400
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,620
You read the Bible, Brett?

401
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:25,220
Y-yes.

402
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:27,780
Well, there's this
passage I got memorized...

403
00:19:27,820 --> 00:19:33,060
sort of fits this occasion.
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

404
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:37,300
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

405
00:19:37,340 --> 00:19:39,300
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

406
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,100
"and the tyranny of evil men.

407
00:19:42,140 --> 00:19:46,900
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

408
00:19:46,940 --> 00:19:49,940
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

409
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:52,460
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

410
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,540
"and the finder
of lost children.

411
00:19:55,580 --> 00:19:58,260
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

412
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:01,780
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

413
00:20:01,820 --> 00:20:06,260
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

414
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,860
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

415
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:13,340
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee!"

416
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,860
No!

417
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,460
Let's stay together

418
00:20:30,860 --> 00:20:33,180
I think you're gonna find...

419
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:37,460
when all this shit
is over and done...

420
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:38,980
I think
you're gonna find yourself...

421
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,940
one smilin' motherfucker.

422
00:20:43,140 --> 00:20:50,340
Thing is, Butch,
right now you got ability.

423
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:55,660
But painful as it may be,
ability don't last.

424
00:20:57,660 --> 00:21:01,740
And your days
are just about over.

425
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:05,780
Now, that's a hard
motherfuckin' fact of life...

426
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,220
but that's a fact of life...

427
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:09,660
your ass is gonna have
to get realistic about.

428
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,860
See, this business
is filled to the brim...

429
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:18,020
with unrealistic
motherfuckers...

430
00:21:18,060 --> 00:21:21,820
motherfuckers who thought
their ass would age like wine.

431
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:28,180
If you mean it turns
to vinegar, it does.

432
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:33,660
If you mean it gets better
with age, it don't.

433
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:37,460
Besides, Butch...

434
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:41,100
how many fights you think
you got in you, anyway?

435
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:46,060
Hmm? Two?

436
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:50,580
Boxers don't have
an Old-timer's Day.

437
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:54,420
You came close,
but you never made it.

438
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:55,980
And if you were
gonna make it...

439
00:21:56,020 --> 00:21:57,940
You would have made it
before now.

440
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:59,580
Good or bad

441
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:02,420
Or happy or sad

442
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:08,820
Ooh, ooh, ooh

443
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:10,580
Ooh, ooooh, ooh

444
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:11,700
Yeah

445
00:22:14,380 --> 00:22:15,940
You my nigger?

446
00:22:21,100 --> 00:22:22,620
It certainly appears so.

447
00:22:29,660 --> 00:22:33,140
Night of the fight,
you may feel a slight sting.

448
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:40,580
That's pride fucking with you.

449
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:44,780
Fuck pride!

450
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:51,020
Pride only hurts.
It never helps.

451
00:22:51,060 --> 00:22:54,380
You fight through that shit.

452
00:22:54,420 --> 00:22:56,780
'Cause a year from now...

453
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:59,220
when you're kickin' it
in the Caribbean...

454
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:03,940
you're gonna say to yourself,
"Marsellus Wallace was right."

455
00:23:03,940 --> 00:23:05,540
Ha ha ha.

456
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:07,780
I got no problem with that,
Mr. Wallace.

457
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:13,260
In the fifth,
your ass goes down.

458
00:23:17,580 --> 00:23:18,740
Say it.

459
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,820
In the fifth, my ass goes down.

460
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:29,180
Yo, Vincent Vega,
our man in Amsterdam.

461
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:31,340
Jules Winnfield,
our man in Inglewood.

462
00:23:31,380 --> 00:23:33,900
Get your asses on in here!

463
00:23:33,940 --> 00:23:35,940
Goddamn, nigger!
What's up with them clothes?

464
00:23:35,980 --> 00:23:37,420
You don't even want to know.

465
00:23:39,340 --> 00:23:40,740
Where's the big man?

466
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,100
Big man's right over there
taking care of some business.

467
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,300
Why don't you hang back
for a second or two, you know?

468
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,940
You see the white boy leave,
just go on over.

469
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:52,580
How you been?

470
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:54,300
I've been doing pretty good.
How 'bout yourself?

471
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:57,220
All right.

472
00:23:58,580 --> 00:24:00,740
So, I hear you're taking Mia out
tomorrow?

473
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:05,860
At Marsellus' request.

474
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,980
Have you met Mia?

475
00:24:09,020 --> 00:24:10,900
Not yet.

476
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:13,340
- What's so fucking funny?
- Not a goddamn thing.

477
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:15,580
I got to piss.

478
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:17,860
Look, I'm not a fucking idiot,
all right?

479
00:24:17,900 --> 00:24:20,700
It's the big man's wife.
I'm gonna sit across from her...

480
00:24:20,740 --> 00:24:22,180
chew my food
with my mouth closed...

481
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:23,900
laugh at her fucking jokes,
and that's it.

482
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:27,060
Hey, my name's Paul,
and this shit's between y'all.

483
00:24:27,100 --> 00:24:29,580
Then what did you fucking ask me
about it for?

484
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,060
Asshole.

485
00:24:38,140 --> 00:24:39,540
Give me a pack of Red Apples.

486
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:41,460
Filters?
- Nah.

487
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,620
You looking at something,
friend?

488
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:48,540
You ain't my friend, palooka.

489
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:51,820
What was that?

490
00:24:51,820 --> 00:24:54,340
I think you heard me just fine,
punchy.

491
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:56,740
Vincent Vega's in the house?

492
00:24:56,780 --> 00:24:59,780
My nigger.
Get your ass over here.

493
00:25:03,380 --> 00:25:07,300
You'd never do that to me

494
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:10,420
- What's up?
- I'm sorry.

495
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,180
Don't worry about it.

496
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,940
Pack of Red Apples.
$1.40.

497
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,580
And some matches.

498
00:25:19,580 --> 00:25:21,460
Here's what I want to do

499
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:24,620
Hey

500
00:25:24,660 --> 00:25:26,140
We ought to stay together

501
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:27,700
It's as if it turns...

502
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:30,540
every part of your body
into the tip of a penis.

503
00:25:30,580 --> 00:25:31,940
Wow.

504
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,540
I'll lend it to you.
It's a great book on piercing.

505
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,420
Well, you see
how they use that gun...

506
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:36,820
to pierce your ears?

507
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:38,700
They don't use that to pierce
your nipples, too, do they?

508
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,860
Forget that gun.

509
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:42,380
That gun goes against
the entire idea behind piercing.

510
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:45,180
All my piercing,
eighteen places on my body...

511
00:25:45,220 --> 00:25:47,420
every one of 'em
done with a needle.

512
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:50,540
Five in each ear. One through
the nipple of my left breast.

513
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:53,620
Two in my right nostril.
One in my left eyebrow.

514
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:56,300
One in my belly. One in my lip.
One in my clit.

515
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:58,580
And I wear a stud in my tongue.

516
00:25:58,620 --> 00:25:59,860
Excuse me.

517
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:03,220
I was just curious, but, um...

518
00:26:03,260 --> 00:26:05,580
why would you wear a stud
in your tongue?

519
00:26:05,620 --> 00:26:08,980
It's a sex thing.
Helps fellatio.

520
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:12,900
Vincenzo. Step into my office.

521
00:26:19,500 --> 00:26:21,020
This is Panda,
from Mexico.

522
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:23,420
Very good stuff.
Now, that's Bava.

523
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,140
Different, but equally good.

524
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,500
And that is Choco, from
the Hartz Mountains of Germany.

525
00:26:28,540 --> 00:26:30,220
Now, the first two
are the same...

526
00:26:30,260 --> 00:26:33,260
300 a gram.
Those are friend prices.

527
00:26:33,300 --> 00:26:35,740
But this one
is a little more expensive.

528
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:39,140
This is 500 a gram,
but when you shoot it...

529
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:41,220
you will know
where that extra money went.

530
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,700
Now, there's nothing wrong
with these two.

531
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:45,260
This is real, real,
real good shit.

532
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:48,780
But this one
is a fucking madman.

533
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:51,180
Remember,
I just got back from Amsterdam.

534
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,820
Am I a nigger?

535
00:26:52,860 --> 00:26:56,060
Are we in Inglewood?
No. You're in my home.

536
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,780
Now, white people
who know the difference...

537
00:26:57,820 --> 00:27:00,700
between good shit and bad shit,
this is the house they come to.

538
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:02,740
Now, my shit,
I'll take the Pepsi Challenge...

539
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:05,660
with that Amsterdam shit
any old day of the fucking week.

540
00:27:05,740 --> 00:27:07,300
That's a bold statement.

541
00:27:07,300 --> 00:27:09,140
This ain't Amsterdam, Vince.

542
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:11,020
This is a seller's market.

543
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:14,900
Coke is fucking dead as... dead.

544
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:17,820
Heroin is coming back
in a big fucking way.

545
00:27:20,020 --> 00:27:22,740
All right,
give me three grams of madman.

546
00:27:22,780 --> 00:27:24,580
If it's as good
as you say it is...

547
00:27:24,620 --> 00:27:26,140
I'll come back
and buy another thousand.

548
00:27:26,180 --> 00:27:29,060
Well, I just hope that I still
have some left for you.

549
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:33,420
But... I'm giving you some
out of my own private stash.

550
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:35,260
That is what a nice guy I am.

551
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:39,180
Hey, I'm out of balloons.
Is a baggie all right?

552
00:27:39,220 --> 00:27:40,660
Yeah, that's cool.

553
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,380
All right.
I'll just get one for you.

554
00:27:42,420 --> 00:27:45,260
Honey,
will you get me some baggies...

555
00:27:45,300 --> 00:27:47,100
and, uh,
twistix from the kitchen?

556
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:49,100
OK.

557
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:51,020
Hey, uh,
what do you think about Trudi?

558
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:52,420
She ain't got a boyfriend.

559
00:27:52,460 --> 00:27:54,500
You want to, uh,
hang out, get high?

560
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,980
Which one is Trudi?

561
00:27:55,980 --> 00:27:57,900
The one with all the shit
in her face.

562
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:02,220
No, that's Jody. That's my wife.

563
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:06,460
- I'm sorry, man.
- Thank you.

564
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:09,180
No, I can't.
Um, I gotta be someplace.

565
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:10,620
All right. No problemo.

566
00:28:10,660 --> 00:28:12,340
I'll take a rain check.

567
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:16,700
Oh.
Thank you, Jody.

568
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:19,740
Still got your Malibu?

569
00:28:19,780 --> 00:28:22,900
Ah, man. You know what some
fucker did the other day?

570
00:28:22,940 --> 00:28:24,860
What?
- Fucking keyed it.

571
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:28,460
- Oh, man, that's fucked up.
Tell me about it.

572
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,580
I had it in storage for 3 years.
It was out 5 days...

573
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:35,340
and some dickless piece of shit
fucked with it.

574
00:28:35,340 --> 00:28:36,540
They should be
fucking killed, man.

575
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:39,020
No trial, no jury,
straight to execution.

576
00:28:39,060 --> 00:28:41,500
Boy, I wish
I could've caught him doing it.

577
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:44,260
I'd have given anything
to catch that asshole doing it.

578
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:46,100
It'a been worth him
doing it...

579
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,620
just so I could've caught him
doing it.

580
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,740
- What a fucker!
- What's more chicken shit...

581
00:28:49,780 --> 00:28:51,260
than fucking
with a man's automobile?

582
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:53,380
I mean, don't fuck
with another man's vehicle.

583
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,700
- You don't do it.
- It's just against the rules.

584
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:58,580
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

585
00:28:58,860 --> 00:29:00,300
Mind if I shoot up here?

586
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,860
Mi casa, su casa.

587
00:29:01,900 --> 00:29:03,460
Muchas gracias.

588
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:02,100
Hello?

589
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,060
Billy Ray was a preacher's son

590
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:06,500
And when his daddy
would visit he'd come along

591
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:10,020
Vincent.

592
00:31:10,060 --> 00:31:15,340
Vincent.
I'm on the intercom.

593
00:31:15,380 --> 00:31:17,540
Where is it?
Where is the intercom?

594
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:20,820
It's on the wall
by the two African fellows.

595
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:22,460
To your right.

596
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,020
...was the son
of a preacher man

597
00:31:25,060 --> 00:31:26,220
The only boy...

598
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:31,420
Warm. Warmer. Disco.

599
00:31:31,460 --> 00:31:34,620
Hello.

600
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,700
Push the button
if you want to talk.

601
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:41,060
- Hello.
- Go make yourself a drink...

602
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:43,580
and I'll be down
in two shakes of a lamb's tail.

603
00:31:44,540 --> 00:31:46,060
The bar is by the fireplace.

604
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:48,300
Being good isn't always easy

605
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:50,500
OK.

606
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:52,980
When he started
sweet-talkin' to me

607
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,540
He'd come and tell me
everything is all right

608
00:31:55,580 --> 00:31:58,100
He'd kiss and tell me
everything is all right

609
00:31:58,140 --> 00:32:00,380
Can I get away again tonight?

610
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:02,900
The only one
who could ever reach me

611
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,460
Was the son of a preacher man

612
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,100
The only boy
who could ever teach me

613
00:32:08,140 --> 00:32:10,060
Was the son of a preacher man

614
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:13,660
Yes, he was, he was

615
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:16,300
- Lord knows he was,
- Ooh, yes, he was

616
00:32:18,420 --> 00:32:21,060
How well I remember

617
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:23,580
The look
that was in his eyes

618
00:32:23,620 --> 00:32:26,140
Stealin' kisses
from me on the sly

619
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:28,460
Takin' time to make time

620
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:31,300
Tellin' me that he's all mine

621
00:32:31,300 --> 00:32:33,460
Learnin' from
each other's knowin'

622
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,620
Lookin' to see
how much we've grown

623
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,740
And the only one
who could ever reach me

624
00:32:38,780 --> 00:32:40,980
Was the son of a preacher man

625
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,620
The only boy
who could ever teach me

626
00:32:43,660 --> 00:32:45,380
Was the son of a preacher man

627
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:48,660
Yes, he was, he was

628
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:51,620
Oh, yes, he was

629
00:32:51,660 --> 00:32:53,460
Let's go.

630
00:32:58,540 --> 00:33:00,060
What the fuck is this place?

631
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:05,820
This is Jack Rabbit Slim's.
An Elvis man should love it.

632
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:07,740
Come on, Mia,
let's go get a steak.

633
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:10,220
You can get a steak here,
daddy-o.

634
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:12,180
Don't be a...

635
00:33:13,340 --> 00:33:15,420
Oh, after you,
kitty cat.

636
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:36,900
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

637
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,580
Now, how may I help you?

638
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,500
There's a reservation
under Wallace.

639
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:44,180
- Wallace?
- We reserved a car.

640
00:33:44,220 --> 00:33:48,100
Oh, a car. Why don't you
seat them in the Chrysler?

641
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:49,900
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

642
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:51,220
Then we start to rock

643
00:33:51,260 --> 00:33:53,060
School gal, baby,
gonna tell you some news

644
00:33:53,100 --> 00:33:55,100
You sure do look good
in them baby doll shoes

645
00:33:55,140 --> 00:33:57,660
Well, it's one, two,
pull off my shoes

646
00:33:57,700 --> 00:33:59,900
Three, four,

00:33:59,940 --> 00:34:01,620
Five, six, gonna get your kicks

648
00:34:01,660 --> 00:34:04,740
Down at the corner
of Lincoln and 46th, yeah

649
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,860
All right

650
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:15,140
I've been waitin'
in school all day long

651
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:17,180
Waitin' on the bell
to ring so I can go home

652
00:34:17,180 --> 00:34:19,700
Throw my books on the table,
Pick up the telephone

653
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,260
Come on, baby,
let's get somethin' goin'

654
00:34:21,300 --> 00:34:23,180
Decaf!
Just a minute.

655
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:25,340
Throw a nickel in the jukebox

656
00:34:25,380 --> 00:34:26,580
Then we start to rock

657
00:34:26,620 --> 00:34:28,220
School's out baby,

00:34:28,260 --> 00:34:30,380

Well, it's one, two,

Down at the corner

You gotta move,

Rockin', rockin', baby,

Ricky! Ricky!

667
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:54,540
Let's hear it for Ricky Nelson!

668
00:34:54,580 --> 00:34:56,540
Fantastic job, Rick.
Thank you very much.

669
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:58,180
Vincent!

670
00:35:01,580 --> 00:35:03,300
Just so that you all know...

671
00:35:03,340 --> 00:35:05,820
Ricky will be back
in the second half of our show.

672
00:35:05,860 --> 00:35:09,620
So we hope you enjoy your meals
here at Jack Rabbit Slim's.

673
00:35:09,620 --> 00:35:11,380
Thank you.

674
00:35:11,420 --> 00:35:13,860
Call for...

675
00:35:13,900 --> 00:35:18,300
Phillip... Morris!

676
00:35:18,340 --> 00:35:19,740
What do you think?

677
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:24,340
I think it's like a wax museum
with a pulse.

678
00:35:24,380 --> 00:35:26,260
Hi, I'm Buddy.
What can I get you?

679
00:35:30,500 --> 00:35:32,140
Let's see.
Steak, steak, steak.

680
00:35:32,180 --> 00:35:35,980
Yeah, the Douglas Sirk steak.
I'll have that.

681
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,380
How do you want that cooked?

682
00:35:37,420 --> 00:35:38,820
Burnt to a crisp,
or bloody as hell?

683
00:35:38,820 --> 00:35:42,140
Bloody as hell, and oh, yeah,
look at this. Vanilla Coke.

684
00:35:43,740 --> 00:35:45,260
What about you, Peggy Sue?

685
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:55,220
I'll have the Durwood Kirby
burger, bloody, and...

686
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,620
the $5.00 shake.

687
00:35:56,660 --> 00:35:57,900
How do you want that shake?

688
00:35:57,940 --> 00:35:59,340
Martin and Lewis,
or Amos and Andy?

689
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:00,620
Martin and Lewis.

690
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,340
Did you just order
a $5.00 shake?

691
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:05,420
Mm-hmm.

692
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:08,100
That's a shake.
That's milk and ice cream.

693
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,020
Last I heard.
- That's $5.00?

694
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:12,780
You don't put bourbon in it
or nothin'?

695
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:15,180
- No.
- Just checkin'.

696
00:36:15,220 --> 00:36:17,180
I'll be right back
with your drinks.

697
00:36:17,220 --> 00:36:18,740
...lonesome town

698
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:23,540
To cry my troubles away...

699
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:26,860
Could you, um...

700
00:36:26,900 --> 00:36:28,980
roll me one of those, cowboy?

701
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:31,860
You can have this one, cowgirl.

702
00:36:31,900 --> 00:36:33,820
Thanks.

703
00:36:33,860 --> 00:36:36,140
...with regret

704
00:36:38,060 --> 00:36:40,260
Think nothin' of it.

705
00:36:40,300 --> 00:36:44,020
...lonesome town

706
00:36:44,060 --> 00:36:46,300
I can learn to forget

707
00:36:46,340 --> 00:36:50,500
So... Marsellus said you
just got back from Amsterdam.

708
00:36:50,540 --> 00:36:53,100
- Sure did.
How long were you there?

709
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:56,020
Just over three years.

710
00:36:57,900 --> 00:37:01,180
I go there about once a year
to chill out for a month.

711
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:04,820
No kiddin'? I didn't know that.

712
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,660
Why would you?

713
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,100
I heard you did a pilot.

714
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:17,260
That was my fifteen minutes.

715
00:37:17,300 --> 00:37:18,860
What was it?

716
00:37:18,860 --> 00:37:21,580
It was a show about a team
of female secret agents...

717
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:23,420
called "Fox Force Five."

718
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:25,940
- What?
"Fox Force Five."

719
00:37:25,980 --> 00:37:28,300
Fox, as in we're
a bunch of foxy chicks.

720
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:30,740
Force, as in we're a force
to be reckoned with.

721
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:33,460
And Five, as in there's one,
two, three, four, five of us.

722
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:35,900
There was a blond one...
Sommerset O'Neal.

723
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:37,340
She was the leader.

724
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:40,060
The Japanese Fox
was a kung-fu master.

725
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:43,860
The black girl
was a demolition expert.

726
00:37:43,900 --> 00:37:46,940
French Fox's speciality was sex.

727
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:48,460
What was your specialty?

728
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:51,180
Knives.

729
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:52,940
Character I played,
Raven McCoy...

730
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:56,980
her background was she grew up
raised by circus performers.

731
00:37:57,020 --> 00:37:58,420
According to the show...

732
00:37:58,460 --> 00:38:01,100
she was the deadliest woman
in the world with a knife...

733
00:38:01,140 --> 00:38:03,860
and she knew
a zillion old jokes.

734
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:07,620
Her grandfather,
an old vaudevillian, taught her.

735
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,700
And if we would've
got picked up...

736
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,100
they would've worked in
a gimmick where every show...

737
00:38:12,140 --> 00:38:14,940
I would've told another joke.

738
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:18,740
You know any of them old jokes?

739
00:38:18,780 --> 00:38:20,140
Well, I only got the chance
to say one...

740
00:38:20,180 --> 00:38:22,420
'cause we only did one show.

741
00:38:22,460 --> 00:38:25,740
- Tell me.
- It's corny.

742
00:38:25,740 --> 00:38:27,540
Don't be that way.
Tell me.

743
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:29,940
No. You wouldn't like it,
and I'd be embarrassed.

744
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,340
You'd be em...

745
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:35,220
You told 50 million people,
and you can't tell me?

746
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:37,140
I promise I won't laugh.

747
00:38:37,180 --> 00:38:39,060
That's what I'm afraid of,
Vince.

748
00:38:39,060 --> 00:38:41,300
That's not what I meant,
and you know it.

749
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:43,140
Well, now I'm definitely
not gonna tell you...

750
00:38:43,180 --> 00:38:44,660
'cause it's been
built up too much.

751
00:38:44,700 --> 00:38:47,220
What a gyp.

752
00:38:49,300 --> 00:38:50,660
Martin and Lewis.

753
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,860
Vanilla Coke.

754
00:38:59,740 --> 00:39:03,220
Mmm. Yummy.

755
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:05,220
You think
I could have a sip of that?

756
00:39:08,340 --> 00:39:09,740
Be my guest.

757
00:39:09,740 --> 00:39:13,620
I gotta know what a $5.00 shake
tastes like.

758
00:39:13,660 --> 00:39:15,700
You can use my straw.
I don't have cooties.

759
00:39:15,740 --> 00:39:19,940
- Yeah, but maybe I do.
- Cooties, I can handle.

760
00:39:19,980 --> 00:39:21,740
All right.

761
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,300
Goddamn, that's a pretty
fuckin' good milk shake.

762
00:39:31,340 --> 00:39:32,780
Told you.

763
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:34,260
I don't know
if it was worth $5.00...

764
00:39:34,260 --> 00:39:35,700
but it was pretty fucking good.

765
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:10,500
Don't you hate that?

766
00:40:10,540 --> 00:40:12,100
Hate what?

767
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:14,420
Uncomfortable silences.

768
00:40:15,660 --> 00:40:17,340
Why do we feel
it's necessary...

769
00:40:17,380 --> 00:40:20,700
to yak about bullshit
in order to be comfortable?

770
00:40:21,700 --> 00:40:25,340
I don't know,
but it's a good question.

771
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:29,140
That's when you know you've
found somebody really special...

772
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:31,500
when you can just
shut the fuck up for a minute...

773
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:33,740
and comfortably share a silence.

774
00:40:33,780 --> 00:40:35,220
Well, I don't think
we're quite there yet...

775
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:37,740
but don't feel bad.
We just met each other.

776
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:41,940
I'll tell you what.

777
00:40:42,020 --> 00:40:45,100
I'm going to go to the bathroom
and powder my nose.

778
00:40:45,140 --> 00:40:48,500
You sit here
and think of something to say.

779
00:40:48,540 --> 00:40:50,620
I'll do that.

780
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:55,660
OK.

781
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:23,620
I said goddamn! Goddamn.

782
00:41:23,660 --> 00:41:26,020
Goddamn.

783
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:29,340
I need some hair spray.

784
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:38,660
Mmm. Don't you just love it...

785
00:41:38,700 --> 00:41:40,140
when you come back
from the bathroom...

786
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:41,860
to find your food
waiting for you?

787
00:41:41,900 --> 00:41:44,260
We're lucky
we got anything at all.

788
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:46,660
I don't think Buddy Holly's
much of a waiter.

789
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:49,060
Maybe we should've sat
in Marilyn Monroe's section.

790
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:50,500
Would you like some coffee?

791
00:41:50,540 --> 00:41:51,980
Which one? There's two Monroes.

792
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:55,660
No, there's not.
That is Marilyn Monroe.

793
00:41:55,700 --> 00:41:59,460
That is Mamie Van Doren.

794
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,100
And I don't see
Jayne Mansfield.

795
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,180
She must have the night off
or somethin'.

796
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,500
- Pretty smart.
- Yeah, I got my moments.

797
00:42:06,540 --> 00:42:08,260
So, did you think
of somethin' to say?

798
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:10,300
Actually, I did.

799
00:42:12,140 --> 00:42:13,860
However...

800
00:42:16,540 --> 00:42:18,060
You seem like
a really nice person...

801
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:20,020
and I don't want to offend you.

802
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:24,380
Ooh. This doesn't sound like
the usual mindless, boring...

803
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:26,500
gettin'-to-know-you chitchat.

804
00:42:26,540 --> 00:42:28,860
That sounds like you actually
have somethin' to say.

805
00:42:28,860 --> 00:42:31,500
Well, well, I do.
I do.

806
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:35,020
But you have to promise
not to be offended.

807
00:42:35,060 --> 00:42:36,420
No! No, no, no.

808
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,660
You can't promise
somethin' like that.

809
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:40,100
I have no idea
what you're gonna ask me...

810
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:42,180
so you can go ahead and ask me
what you're gonna ask me...

811
00:42:42,220 --> 00:42:45,140
and my natural response
could be to get offended.

812
00:42:45,180 --> 00:42:46,620
Then,
through no fault of my own...

813
00:42:46,660 --> 00:42:49,100
- I would've broken my promise.
- Let's just forget it.

814
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:50,620
That's an impossibility.

815
00:42:50,700 --> 00:42:52,540
Trying to forget anything
as intriguing as this...

816
00:42:52,580 --> 00:42:54,140
would be an exercise
in futility.

817
00:42:54,140 --> 00:42:55,540
Is that a fact?

818
00:42:55,580 --> 00:42:58,420
Besides,
isn't it more exciting...

819
00:42:58,420 --> 00:43:01,220
- when you don't have permission?
All right. All right.

820
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,060
Well, here it goes.

821
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:06,900
What did you, uh, think about
what happened to Antwan?

822
00:43:06,940 --> 00:43:08,020
Who's Antwan?

823
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:10,260
Tony Rocky Horror. You know him.

824
00:43:10,300 --> 00:43:11,820
He fell out of a window.

825
00:43:11,860 --> 00:43:15,140
Mmm. Mmm.
Well, that is one way to say it.

826
00:43:15,220 --> 00:43:17,740
Another way to say it
would be that he was thrown out.

827
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:21,140
Another way would be was he was
thrown out by Marsellus...

828
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:23,060
and yet even another way
is to say...

829
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:26,100
he was thrown of a window
by Marsellus because of you.

830
00:43:26,140 --> 00:43:28,500
Is that a fact?

831
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,420
No, no. It's not a fact.
It's just what I heard.

832
00:43:30,460 --> 00:43:33,220
- It's just what I heard.
- Who told you?

833
00:43:33,260 --> 00:43:35,060
They.

834
00:43:35,100 --> 00:43:36,820
They talk a lot, don't they?

835
00:43:38,940 --> 00:43:41,540
They certainly do.
They certainly do.

836
00:43:41,580 --> 00:43:43,460
Don't be shy, Vincent.
What else did they say?

837
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,220
Well, I'm not... I'm not shy.
Um...

838
00:43:46,260 --> 00:43:48,340
Did it involve the "F" word?

839
00:43:48,380 --> 00:43:49,740
No. No, no, no.

840
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:52,220
They just said that Antwan
had given you a foot massage.

841
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:57,180
- And?
- And... and nothin'. That's it.

842
00:43:59,060 --> 00:44:02,420
You heard Marsellus
threw Tony Rocky Horror...

843
00:44:02,460 --> 00:44:04,540
out of a four-story window
for giving me a foot massage?

844
00:44:04,580 --> 00:44:07,220
Mm-hmm.
- And you believe that?

845
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:09,460
Well, I mean...

846
00:44:09,500 --> 00:44:11,700
at the time I was told,
it sounded reasonable.

847
00:44:11,740 --> 00:44:14,420
Marsellus throwing Tony
out of a four-story window...

848
00:44:14,460 --> 00:44:17,020
for massaging my feet
seemed reasonable?

849
00:44:17,060 --> 00:44:18,460
No, it seemed excessive...

850
00:44:18,460 --> 00:44:21,300
but that doesn't mean it didn't
happen. I mean, I understand...

851
00:44:21,340 --> 00:44:23,700
that Marsellus is very,
very protective of you.

852
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:27,820
A husband being protective
of his wife is one thing.

853
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:29,580
A husband
almost killing another man...

854
00:44:29,620 --> 00:44:31,860
for touching his wife's feet
is something else.

855
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:33,700
But did it happen?

856
00:44:33,740 --> 00:44:35,420
Only thing Antwan
ever touched of mine...

857
00:44:35,460 --> 00:44:40,100
was my hand when he shook it...
at my wedding.

858
00:44:40,140 --> 00:44:41,540
Really?

859
00:44:41,580 --> 00:44:43,460
Truth is,
nobody knows why Marsellus...

860
00:44:43,500 --> 00:44:44,980
threw Tony out of
that four-story window...

861
00:44:45,020 --> 00:44:47,140
except Marsellus and Tony.

862
00:44:47,180 --> 00:44:49,140
But when you little scamps
get together...

863
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,700
you're worse
than a sewing circle.

864
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:52,940
Ladies and gentlemen...

865
00:44:52,980 --> 00:44:55,380
now the moment
you've all been waiting for...

866
00:44:55,420 --> 00:45:00,340
the world-famous Jack Rabbit
Slim's Twist Contest.

867
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:06,700
This is where
one lucky couple...

868
00:45:06,740 --> 00:45:10,780
will win this handsome trophy
that Marilyn here is holding.

869
00:45:10,780 --> 00:45:14,580
Now, who'll be
our first contestants?

870
00:45:14,620 --> 00:45:16,020
Right here!

871
00:45:16,060 --> 00:45:18,340
Hey, all right!
- I wanna dance.

872
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:19,940
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

873
00:45:19,980 --> 00:45:21,820
No, no, no, no, no, no.

874
00:45:21,860 --> 00:45:24,500
I do believe Marsellus...
my husband, your boss...

875
00:45:24,540 --> 00:45:27,140
told you to take me out
and do whatever I wanted.

876
00:45:27,180 --> 00:45:29,740
Now I want to dance.
I want to win.

877
00:45:29,780 --> 00:45:32,580
I want that trophy,
so dance good.

878
00:45:32,580 --> 00:45:34,020
All right. You asked for it.

879
00:45:34,100 --> 00:45:35,540
Let's hear it
for our first contestants.

880
00:45:41,300 --> 00:45:44,100
Let's meet our first
contestants here this evening.

881
00:45:44,140 --> 00:45:46,260
Young lady, what is your name?

882
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:48,140
Mrs. Mia Wallace.

883
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,060
And how about your fella here?

884
00:45:51,140 --> 00:45:52,500
Vincent Vega.

885
00:45:52,540 --> 00:45:55,220
All right. Let's see
what you can do. Take it away!

886
00:45:55,260 --> 00:45:57,300
Yay!
Go for it!

887
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:58,860
All right!

888
00:46:16,380 --> 00:46:17,980
It was a teenage wedding

889
00:46:18,020 --> 00:46:20,220
And the old folks
wished 'em well

890
00:46:22,020 --> 00:46:23,660
You could see that Pierre

891
00:46:23,700 --> 00:46:26,100
Did truly love the mademoiselle

892
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,140
And now the young
monsieur and Madame

893
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:32,100
Have rung the chapel bell

894
00:46:33,780 --> 00:46:35,700
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

895
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:37,940
It goes to show
you never can tell

896
00:46:39,740 --> 00:46:41,340
They furnished off
an apartment

897
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:43,940
With a two-room Roebuck sale

898
00:46:45,500 --> 00:46:47,140
The coolerator was crammed

899
00:46:47,180 --> 00:46:49,660
With TV dinners and ginger ale

900
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:52,820
But when Pierre found work

901
00:46:52,900 --> 00:46:55,060
The little money comin'
worked out well

902
00:46:57,220 --> 00:46:59,020
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

903
00:46:59,060 --> 00:47:01,380
It goes to show
you never can tell

904
00:47:02,900 --> 00:47:04,900
They had a hi-fi phono

905
00:47:04,940 --> 00:47:07,020
Boy, did they let it blast

906
00:47:08,980 --> 00:47:10,780
700 little records

907
00:47:10,780 --> 00:47:13,100
All rock, rhythm, and jazz

908
00:47:14,860 --> 00:47:16,300
But when the sun went down

909
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:18,780
The rapid tempo
of the music fell

910
00:47:20,660 --> 00:47:22,540
"C'est la vie,"
say the old folks

911
00:47:22,580 --> 00:47:24,700
It goes to show
you never can tell

912
00:47:49,980 --> 00:47:51,660
They had a teenage wedding

913
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,420
And the old folks
wished 'em well

914
00:47:55,860 --> 00:47:57,380
You could see that Pierre

915
00:47:57,420 --> 00:47:59,940
Did truly love
the mademoiselle

916
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:23,860
Ha ha ha!

917
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:36,300
Is that what you call
an uncomfortable silence?

918
00:48:36,340 --> 00:48:39,460
I don't know what you call that.

919
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:43,140
Drinks. Music.

920
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,740
I'm gonna take a piss.

921
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:47,900
That's a little bit
more information...

922
00:48:47,940 --> 00:48:50,420
than I needed, Vince,
but go right ahead.

923
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:04,220
Girl

924
00:49:04,260 --> 00:49:06,300
Bow, bow, bow

925
00:49:06,340 --> 00:49:10,300
You'll be a woman soon

926
00:49:13,500 --> 00:49:15,540
I love you so much,
can't count all the ways

927
00:49:15,580 --> 00:49:18,420
I'd die for you, girl,
and all they can say is

928
00:49:18,460 --> 00:49:20,300
He's not your kind

929
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:23,700
They never get tired
of puttin' me down

930
00:49:23,740 --> 00:49:26,300
And I never know
when I come around

931
00:49:26,340 --> 00:49:28,700
What I'm gonna find

932
00:49:28,780 --> 00:49:32,620
Don't let them
make up your mind

933
00:49:32,660 --> 00:49:34,860
Don't you know, girl

934
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,860
Bow, bow, bow

935
00:49:36,860 --> 00:49:40,580
You'll be a woman soon

936
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,260
One drink and that's it.

937
00:49:43,300 --> 00:49:45,820
Don't be rude.
Drink your drink.

938
00:49:45,860 --> 00:49:47,300
But do it quickly.

939
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:51,300
Say good night and go home.

940
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:53,260
Girl

941
00:49:53,300 --> 00:49:57,580
You'll be a woman soon

942
00:49:58,540 --> 00:50:01,460
Soon

943
00:50:01,500 --> 00:50:05,060
You'll need a woman

944
00:50:06,700 --> 00:50:08,460
I've been misunderstood
for all of my life

945
00:50:08,500 --> 00:50:11,620
But what they're sayin', girl,
just cuts like a knife

946
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,380
The boy's no good

947
00:50:14,420 --> 00:50:16,500
Well, I finally have found
what I've been lookin' for

948
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:18,940
But if they get a chance,
they'll end it for sure

949
00:50:18,980 --> 00:50:21,620
Sure they would

950
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:24,980
Baby, I've done...

951
00:50:25,020 --> 00:50:28,100
You see, this is a moral test
of oneself.

952
00:50:28,140 --> 00:50:30,900
Whether or not
you can maintain loyalty.

953
00:50:30,940 --> 00:50:34,540
Because being loyal
is very important.

954
00:50:34,580 --> 00:50:36,180
They never
get tired of puttin' me down

955
00:50:36,220 --> 00:50:39,020
And I never know
when I come around

956
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:41,180
What I'm gonna find

957
00:50:41,220 --> 00:50:45,540
Don't let them
make up your mind

958
00:50:45,580 --> 00:50:47,740
Don't you know, girl

959
00:50:49,620 --> 00:50:54,020
You'll be a woman soon

960
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:56,300
Please

961
00:50:57,740 --> 00:51:00,780
Come take my hand

962
00:51:03,100 --> 00:51:04,220
Girl

963
00:51:06,220 --> 00:51:09,980
You'll be a woman soon

964
00:51:11,180 --> 00:51:12,460
Please

965
00:51:14,100 --> 00:51:17,020
Come take my hand

966
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,060
Hello.

967
00:51:20,100 --> 00:51:22,100
Girl

968
00:51:22,140 --> 00:51:25,020
So, you're gonna go out there,
you're gonna say...

969
00:51:25,060 --> 00:51:27,220
"Good night.
I've had a very lovely evening."

970
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:30,620
Walk out the door
and get in the car.

971
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:33,420
Go home, jerk off,
and that's all you're gonna do.

972
00:51:37,380 --> 00:51:40,300
Now it's up to you, girl

973
00:51:42,260 --> 00:51:46,220
You'll be a woman soon

974
00:51:47,420 --> 00:51:48,700
Please

975
00:51:50,500 --> 00:51:53,540
Come take my hand

976
00:51:58,940 --> 00:52:02,580
You'll be a woman soon

977
00:52:03,740 --> 00:52:05,180
Soon

978
00:52:06,820 --> 00:52:10,500
You'll need a man

979
00:52:19,060 --> 00:52:23,300
All right, Mia.
So, listen, I gotta go.

980
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:25,140
All right?

981
00:52:27,340 --> 00:52:30,660
Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

982
00:52:30,700 --> 00:52:35,620
You f... Oh, Jesus Christ.
Oh, fuck me! Fuck me!

983
00:52:35,660 --> 00:52:38,140
Oh, come on, girl.
We're gettin' out of here.

984
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:40,260
We gotta walk now.

985
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,740
Don't fucking die on me, Mia.

986
00:52:52,780 --> 00:52:54,220
Silly fuck.

987
00:53:02,260 --> 00:53:03,300
Answer!

988
00:53:04,460 --> 00:53:05,980
Have you got the ring?

989
00:53:06,020 --> 00:53:07,100
Why, certainly.

990
00:53:07,140 --> 00:53:08,340
Join hands,
you two love birds.

991
00:53:08,380 --> 00:53:09,460
Uh-uh.

992
00:53:09,460 --> 00:53:11,340
Please. Please.
Hurry up.

993
00:53:11,340 --> 00:53:12,580
Yes, yes, yes, indeed.

994
00:53:12,620 --> 00:53:14,460
Hold hands, you love birds.

995
00:53:20,580 --> 00:53:22,540
Fuck you, Lance! Answer!

996
00:53:27,900 --> 00:53:29,780
Now, what do you say?

997
00:53:29,780 --> 00:53:32,220
I give up,
I'll marry you!

998
00:53:34,220 --> 00:53:36,860
Lance!
The goddamn phone's ringing!

999
00:53:38,540 --> 00:53:39,900
I can hear it.

1000
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:41,580
I thought you told
those fuckin' assholes...

1001
00:53:41,620 --> 00:53:43,260
never to call here this late.

1002
00:53:43,260 --> 00:53:44,620
Yeah, I told 'em...

1003
00:53:44,660 --> 00:53:46,740
and that is exactly
what I'm going to tell...

1004
00:53:46,780 --> 00:53:48,340
this fucking asshole right now.

1005
00:53:48,380 --> 00:53:50,740
I'll teach you a thing or two.

1006
00:53:50,780 --> 00:53:51,900
Don't you dare strike me!

1007
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:52,860
Hello?

1008
00:53:52,900 --> 00:53:54,420
Lance, Vincent.

1009
00:53:54,460 --> 00:53:56,380
I'm in big fuckin' trouble, man.

1010
00:53:56,420 --> 00:53:57,980
I'm comin' to your house.

1011
00:53:58,020 --> 00:54:00,500
Whoa, whoa.
Hold your horses, man.

1012
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:01,940
Wh-what's the problem?

1013
00:54:01,980 --> 00:54:04,100
I got this chick,
she's fuckin' Odin on me.

1014
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:05,180
Don't bring her here.

1015
00:54:05,220 --> 00:54:07,140
I'm not even fucking
joking with you, man.

1016
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,340
Don't not be bringing some
fucked-up pooh-butt to my house.

1017
00:54:09,380 --> 00:54:10,300
No choice.

1018
00:54:10,340 --> 00:54:11,420
She's O.D. In'?

1019
00:54:11,460 --> 00:54:13,380
She's fuckin' dyin' on me, man!

1020
00:54:13,420 --> 00:54:16,300
OK, well, then you bite
the fuckin' bullet...

1021
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:18,580
and you take her to a hospital
and call a lawyer.

1022
00:54:18,620 --> 00:54:19,580
Negative.

1023
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,140
This is not
my fuckin' problem, man!

1024
00:54:21,180 --> 00:54:24,820
You fucked her up,
you fuckin' deal with this!

1025
00:54:24,860 --> 00:54:27,940
Are you talking to me
on a cellular phone?

1026
00:54:27,980 --> 00:54:29,300
I don't know you.
Who is this?

1027
00:54:29,340 --> 00:54:30,700
Don't come here.
I'm hanging up the phone.

1028
00:54:30,740 --> 00:54:31,980
Prank caller! Prank caller!

1029
00:54:42,060 --> 00:54:44,020
What the hell was that?!

1030
00:54:45,020 --> 00:54:46,900
Have you lost
your fucking mind?!

1031
00:54:46,940 --> 00:54:49,180
You were talking about drug shit
on a cellular ph...

1032
00:54:49,220 --> 00:54:50,180
Lance, help me.

1033
00:54:50,220 --> 00:54:51,580
You crashed your car
into my fuckin' house!

1034
00:54:51,620 --> 00:54:52,540
Grab her feet.

1035
00:54:52,580 --> 00:54:54,300
Hey, hey, hey!
Are you deaf?

1036
00:54:54,340 --> 00:54:57,020
You are not bringing this
fucked-up bitch into my house!

1037
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:59,060
This fucked-up bitch
is Marsellus Wallace's wife.

1038
00:54:59,100 --> 00:55:01,100
Do you know
who Marsellus Wallace is?

1039
00:55:01,140 --> 00:55:02,140
Yeah.

1040
00:55:02,220 --> 00:55:04,300
If she croaks on me,
I'm a fucking grease spot!

1041
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:08,180
I will be forced to tell him
that you did not help...

1042
00:55:08,220 --> 00:55:10,300
and that you let her die
on your fuckin' lawn.

1043
00:55:10,300 --> 00:55:13,420
Now, come on, help me.
Help me. Pick her up.

1044
00:55:13,460 --> 00:55:14,580
Shit!

1045
00:55:17,460 --> 00:55:19,940
Lance!

1046
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:21,260
Shit!

1047
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,780
It's 1:30
in the goddamn morning.

1048
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:25,940
What the fuck's
going on out here?

1049
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:27,660
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

1050
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:29,180
Who's she?

1051
00:55:29,220 --> 00:55:31,780
Go to the fridge
and get the adrenaline shot.

1052
00:55:31,820 --> 00:55:33,020
What's wrong with her?

1053
00:55:33,060 --> 00:55:35,220
- She's O.D.ing!
- Get her out of here!

1054
00:55:35,260 --> 00:55:36,420
Get the shot!

1055
00:55:36,460 --> 00:55:38,380
Fuck you!
Fuck you, too!

1056
00:55:38,420 --> 00:55:39,820
What a fuckin' bitch.

1057
00:55:39,860 --> 00:55:41,140
Just keep talkin' to her.

1058
00:55:41,180 --> 00:55:42,140
She's gettin' the shot.

1059
00:55:42,180 --> 00:55:43,780
I'm gonna go get
my little black medical book.

1060
00:55:43,820 --> 00:55:45,260
What the fuck you need
a medical book for?

1061
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:47,300
I never had to give
an adrenaline shot before.

1062
00:55:47,340 --> 00:55:48,260
You've never given
an adrenaline shot?

1063
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:49,460
I never had to.

1064
00:55:49,500 --> 00:55:50,660
I don't go joypopping
with a bunch of bubblegummers.

1065
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:51,700
My friends
can handle their highs.

1066
00:55:51,740 --> 00:55:53,740
- Get the shot!
- I am if you'll let me.

1067
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:55,020
I ain't fucking stopping you!

1068
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:56,500
Well, stop talkin' to me.
Start talkin' to her!

1069
00:55:56,540 --> 00:55:57,940
- Get the shot!
- All right!

1070
00:56:01,820 --> 00:56:03,580
Hurry up, Lance!
We're losin' her!

1071
00:56:03,620 --> 00:56:05,180
I'm lookin' as fast as I can!

1072
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:06,860
What's he lookin' for?

1073
00:56:06,900 --> 00:56:08,660
I don't know. Some book.

1074
00:56:08,700 --> 00:56:10,060
What are you lookin' for?

1075
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:11,500
My little black medical book!

1076
00:56:11,500 --> 00:56:12,780
What are you lookin' for?

1077
00:56:12,820 --> 00:56:14,300
A little black
fuckin' medical book!

1078
00:56:14,340 --> 00:56:17,060
It's like a textbook
they give to nurses.

1079
00:56:17,100 --> 00:56:18,660
I never saw no medical book.

1080
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:19,940
Well, trust me, I have one.

1081
00:56:19,980 --> 00:56:22,220
If it's so important, why don't
you keep it with the shot?

1082
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:23,820
I don't know!
Stop bothering me!

1083
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:26,300
While you're lookin' for it,
she's gonna die on our carpet.

1084
00:56:26,340 --> 00:56:27,580
You're never gonna find anything
in this mess.

1085
00:56:27,620 --> 00:56:30,340
Honey, I'm going to fucking
kill you if you don't shut up!

1086
00:56:30,380 --> 00:56:32,340
Get in here!

1087
00:56:32,380 --> 00:56:33,580
Christ.

1088
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:35,300
Get the fuck out of my way.

1089
00:56:35,340 --> 00:56:36,380
Pig.

1090
00:56:36,420 --> 00:56:38,580
Quit fuckin' around
and give her the shot.

1091
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:39,700
While I'm doin' this...

1092
00:56:39,740 --> 00:56:42,460
you take off her shirt
and find her heart.

1093
00:56:42,500 --> 00:56:44,620
It's got to be exact?
Yeah, exact.

1094
00:56:44,660 --> 00:56:46,540
A shot in the heart,
so I guess it's gotta be exact.

1095
00:56:46,580 --> 00:56:49,060
I don't know exactly where
her heart is. I think it's here.

1096
00:56:49,100 --> 00:56:50,540
- That's it.
- This it?

1097
00:56:50,580 --> 00:56:53,380
What I need
is a big fat magic marker.

1098
00:56:53,420 --> 00:56:54,860
- You got it?
- What?

1099
00:56:54,940 --> 00:56:59,540
A magic marker! A felt pen!
A fuckin' black magic marker!

1100
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,380
All right.
Hurry up.

1101
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:05,100
Fuck. OK, OK, OK.
I think it's ready.

1102
00:57:07,620 --> 00:57:10,500
- Hurry up, man. Hurry up.
- I'll tell you what to do.

1103
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,420
No, no, no.
You're gonna give her the shot.

1104
00:57:12,460 --> 00:57:13,900
- You're gonna give her the shot.
- I ain't givin' her the shot.

1105
00:57:13,900 --> 00:57:15,300
- I ain't givin' her the shot.
- I never done this before.

1106
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:17,220
I ain't never done it before,
either. I ain't startin' now.

1107
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,300
You brought her here, that means
you're gonna give her the shot.

1108
00:57:19,340 --> 00:57:20,660
The day I bring an O.D.ing bitch
to your house...

1109
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:22,380
then I give her the shot.
Give her the shot.

1110
00:57:22,420 --> 00:57:23,460
- Give it to me.
- Here.

1111
00:57:23,500 --> 00:57:24,460
Give me that.

1112
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:27,500
Tell me what to do.

1113
00:57:27,540 --> 00:57:30,260
OK. You're giving her
an injection of adrenaline...

1114
00:57:30,300 --> 00:57:31,900
straight to her heart,
but she's got a breastplate.

1115
00:57:31,940 --> 00:57:33,140
You've got to
pierce through that.

1116
00:57:33,180 --> 00:57:36,260
You gotta bring the needle down
in a stabbing motion.

1117
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,900
I gotta stab her three times?

1118
00:57:37,940 --> 00:57:39,700
No! You don't gotta stab her
three times. Just once.

1119
00:57:39,740 --> 00:57:42,140
But hard enough to get through
her breastplate into her heart.

1120
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:45,060
Once you do that,
you press down on the plunger.

1121
00:57:45,100 --> 00:57:47,140
OK, then what happens?

1122
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:48,460
I'm kind of curious
about that myself.

1123
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:49,620
This ain't no fuckin' joke, man!

1124
00:57:49,660 --> 00:57:51,020
- Am I gonna kill her?
- No, no!

1125
00:57:51,060 --> 00:57:53,060
She's supposed to come
out of it like that.

1126
00:57:53,100 --> 00:57:55,260
All right. Count to three.
Ready?

1127
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:56,500
One...

1128
00:58:01,540 --> 00:58:03,060
two...

1129
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:12,620
Three!

1130
00:58:13,700 --> 00:58:16,060
Aah! Aah! Aah!

1131
00:58:26,660 --> 00:58:29,740
If you're all right,
then say something.

1132
00:58:29,780 --> 00:58:32,660
Something.

1133
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:35,980
Ha ha. That was fuckin' trippy.
Ha ha ha ha.

1134
00:58:36,020 --> 00:58:38,220
Uhh.

1135
00:58:38,220 --> 00:58:40,260
Oh, man.

1136
00:59:03,940 --> 00:59:05,820
Mia. Mia.

1137
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:08,980
What's...

1138
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:13,060
what's your thoughts on... on...

1139
00:59:13,060 --> 00:59:15,540
on how to handle this?

1140
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:16,940
What's yours?

1141
00:59:19,900 --> 00:59:22,100
Well, I'm of the opinion...

1142
00:59:22,140 --> 00:59:24,220
that if Marsellus
lived his whole life...

1143
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:27,460
he don't need to know nothin'
about this incident.

1144
00:59:27,500 --> 00:59:30,020
If Marsellus knew
about this incident...

1145
00:59:30,060 --> 00:59:32,380
I'd be in as much trouble
as you.

1146
00:59:32,420 --> 00:59:34,820
I seriously doubt that.

1147
00:59:34,900 --> 00:59:37,460
I can keep a secret if you can.

1148
00:59:39,540 --> 00:59:40,940
Shake on it?

1149
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:48,420
Mum's the word?

1150
00:59:49,460 --> 00:59:50,660
Cool.

1151
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,180
Now, if you'll excuse me...

1152
00:59:52,220 --> 00:59:53,980
I'm gonna go home
and have a heart attack.

1153
00:59:57,260 --> 00:59:58,420
Vincent!

1154
01:00:01,140 --> 01:00:04,060
Do you want to hear
my "Fox Force Five" joke?

1155
01:00:05,340 --> 01:00:06,540
Sure.

1156
01:00:06,580 --> 01:00:10,020
Except that I think I'm still
a little too petrified to laugh.

1157
01:00:10,060 --> 01:00:12,620
No, you won't laugh
'cause it's not funny.

1158
01:00:12,660 --> 01:00:15,100
But if you still wanna hear it,
I'll tell it.

1159
01:00:15,140 --> 01:00:17,220
I can't wait.

1160
01:00:17,260 --> 01:00:18,260
OK.

1161
01:00:18,300 --> 01:00:20,580
Three tomatoes are walking
down the street...

1162
01:00:20,620 --> 01:00:22,980
Papa Tomato, Mama Tomato,
and Baby Tomato.

1163
01:00:23,020 --> 01:00:24,860
Baby Tomato
starts lagging behind...

1164
01:00:24,900 --> 01:00:27,780
and Papa Tomato
gets really angry...

1165
01:00:27,780 --> 01:00:31,540
goes back and squishes him,
and says, "Catch up."

1166
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,140
Hmm. Hmm.

1167
01:00:35,180 --> 01:00:36,260
Ketchup.

1168
01:00:41,060 --> 01:00:42,580
See you around.

1169
01:01:03,500 --> 01:01:06,820
Oh, that Paddlefoot...
he funny, silly dog.

1170
01:01:06,860 --> 01:01:10,380
He think totem pole alive.
Hee hee hee!

1171
01:01:10,420 --> 01:01:12,420
He arctic tenderfoot.

1172
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:14,020
Ho ho ho ho!

1173
01:01:14,060 --> 01:01:16,860
That totem pole
been here forever.

1174
01:01:16,900 --> 01:01:17,860
Butch?

1175
01:01:20,740 --> 01:01:22,460
Butch,
stop watching TV a second.

1176
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,660
Yeah?

1177
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:25,900
We got a special visitor.

1178
01:01:28,940 --> 01:01:31,500
Now... do you
remember when I told you...

1179
01:01:31,540 --> 01:01:34,540
your daddy died
in a P.O.W. Camp?

1180
01:01:34,580 --> 01:01:38,340
Well... this here
is Captain Koons.

1181
01:01:38,380 --> 01:01:40,940
He was in the P.O.W. Camp
with Daddy.

1182
01:01:46,300 --> 01:01:48,060
Hello, little man.

1183
01:01:48,100 --> 01:01:51,980
Boy, I sure heard
a bunch about you.

1184
01:01:52,020 --> 01:01:55,220
See, I was a good friend
of your dad's.

1185
01:01:55,260 --> 01:01:58,460
We were in that Hanoi
pit of hell together...

1186
01:01:58,500 --> 01:02:00,780
over five years.

1187
01:02:00,820 --> 01:02:02,660
Hopefully...

1188
01:02:02,700 --> 01:02:05,140
you'll never have to experience
this yourself...

1189
01:02:05,180 --> 01:02:07,540
but when two men
are in a situation...

1190
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,740
like me and your dad were
for as long as we were...

1191
01:02:11,740 --> 01:02:15,180
you take on certain
responsibilities of the other.

1192
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:17,580
If it had been me who'd...

1193
01:02:19,140 --> 01:02:20,660
not made it...

1194
01:02:20,700 --> 01:02:24,900
Major Coolidge would be talkin'
right now to my son... Jim.

1195
01:02:24,940 --> 01:02:27,180
But the way
it turned out...

1196
01:02:27,220 --> 01:02:28,620
I'm talkin' to you...

1197
01:02:29,940 --> 01:02:31,300
Butch.

1198
01:02:33,180 --> 01:02:34,780
I got somethin' for ya.

1199
01:02:41,300 --> 01:02:43,460
This watch I got here...

1200
01:02:43,500 --> 01:02:45,620
was first purchased
by your great-grandfather...

1201
01:02:45,660 --> 01:02:47,860
during the First World War.

1202
01:02:47,900 --> 01:02:50,140
It was bought
in a little general store...

1203
01:02:50,140 --> 01:02:52,380
in Knoxville, Tennessee.

1204
01:02:52,420 --> 01:02:55,940
Made by the first company
to ever make wristwatches.

1205
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:59,020
Up till then, people just
carried pocket watches.

1206
01:02:59,060 --> 01:03:02,220
It was bought by Private
Doughboy Erine Coolidge...

1207
01:03:02,260 --> 01:03:04,780
on the day he set sail
for Paris.

1208
01:03:04,820 --> 01:03:06,900
This was your great-
grandfather's war watch...

1209
01:03:06,940 --> 01:03:09,340
and he wore it every day
he was in that war.

1210
01:03:09,380 --> 01:03:11,660
And when he'd done his duty...

1211
01:03:11,700 --> 01:03:13,820
he went home
to your great-grandmother...

1212
01:03:13,860 --> 01:03:15,100
took the watch off...

1213
01:03:15,140 --> 01:03:17,020
put it in an old coffee can...

1214
01:03:17,060 --> 01:03:18,300
and in that can it stayed...

1215
01:03:18,340 --> 01:03:21,020
Till your granddad,
Dane Coolidge...

1216
01:03:21,060 --> 01:03:22,540
was called upon
by his country...

1217
01:03:22,580 --> 01:03:26,300
to go overseas and fight
the Germans once again.

1218
01:03:26,340 --> 01:03:29,820
This time they called it
World War II.

1219
01:03:29,860 --> 01:03:31,380
Your great-grandfather
gave this watch...

1220
01:03:31,420 --> 01:03:34,740
to your granddad for good luck.

1221
01:03:34,740 --> 01:03:37,660
Unfortunately, Dane's luck
wasn't as good as his old man's.

1222
01:03:37,700 --> 01:03:40,180
Dane was a marine,
and he was killed...

1223
01:03:40,220 --> 01:03:43,940
along with all the other marines
at the Battle of Wake Island.

1224
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:47,220
Your granddad was facing death.

1225
01:03:47,260 --> 01:03:49,100
He knew it.

1226
01:03:49,140 --> 01:03:50,740
None of those boys
had any illusions...

1227
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:53,140
about ever leaving
that island alive...

1228
01:03:53,180 --> 01:03:56,140
so, three days before
the Japanese took the island...

1229
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,140
your granddad asked a gunner
on an Air Force transport...

1230
01:03:59,180 --> 01:04:01,500
name of Winocki...

1231
01:04:01,540 --> 01:04:03,940
a man he had never met
before in his life...

1232
01:04:03,980 --> 01:04:07,100
to deliver to his infant son...

1233
01:04:07,140 --> 01:04:09,140
who he had never seen
in the flesh...

1234
01:04:09,180 --> 01:04:11,620
his gold watch.

1235
01:04:11,660 --> 01:04:13,700
Three days later,
your granddad was dead...

1236
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,660
but Winocki kept his word.

1237
01:04:15,700 --> 01:04:17,580
After the war was over...

1238
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:19,940
he paid a visit
to your grandmother...

1239
01:04:19,980 --> 01:04:22,100
delivering
to your infant father...

1240
01:04:22,140 --> 01:04:23,940
his dad's gold watch.

1241
01:04:23,980 --> 01:04:25,660
This watch.

1242
01:04:31,540 --> 01:04:33,740
This watch
was on your daddy's wrist...

1243
01:04:33,780 --> 01:04:36,740
when he was shot down
over Hanoi.

1244
01:04:36,780 --> 01:04:40,140
He was captured,
put in a Vietnamese prison camp.

1245
01:04:40,180 --> 01:04:44,100
He knew that if the gooks
ever saw the watch...

1246
01:04:44,140 --> 01:04:45,500
they'd confiscate it...

1247
01:04:45,540 --> 01:04:46,740
take it away.

1248
01:04:46,780 --> 01:04:51,140
The way your dad looked at it,
this watch was your birthright.

1249
01:04:51,180 --> 01:04:53,780
He'd be damned if any slopes
put their greasy yellow hands...

1250
01:04:53,820 --> 01:04:55,940
on his boy's birthright,
so he hid it...

1251
01:04:55,980 --> 01:04:58,820
in one place he knew he could
hide somethin'... his ass.

1252
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:02,260
Five long years he wore
this watch up his ass.

1253
01:05:02,300 --> 01:05:06,220
Then he died of dysentery,
he give me the watch.

1254
01:05:06,260 --> 01:05:09,820
I hid this uncomfortable hunk
of metal up my ass, two years.

1255
01:05:09,860 --> 01:05:13,140
Then... after seven years...

1256
01:05:13,140 --> 01:05:16,020
I was sent home to my family.
And...

1257
01:05:16,060 --> 01:05:17,460
now...

1258
01:05:20,060 --> 01:05:22,940
little man,
I give the watch to you.

1259
01:05:44,940 --> 01:05:46,460
It's time, Butch.

1260
01:06:00,380 --> 01:06:03,380
...weighing 210 pounds...

1261
01:06:03,420 --> 01:06:06,260
Floyd Ray Wilson!

1262
01:06:08,980 --> 01:06:11,700
It's official.
It's official. Wilson is dead!

1263
01:06:11,740 --> 01:06:13,340
Dan,
that had to be the bloodiest...

1264
01:06:13,380 --> 01:06:15,740
and the most brutal fight
this city has ever seen.

1265
01:06:15,780 --> 01:06:18,220
Coolidge left faster than I've
ever seen a victorious boxer...

1266
01:06:18,260 --> 01:06:19,380
leave the ring.

1267
01:06:19,420 --> 01:06:20,820
Do you think he knew
Wilson was dead?

1268
01:06:20,860 --> 01:06:22,020
My guess would be yes, Richard.

1269
01:06:22,060 --> 01:06:24,660
I could see
the frenzy in his eyes...

1270
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:26,140
give way to the realization
of what he was doing.

1271
01:06:26,180 --> 01:06:28,060
I think any man would have
left the ring that fast.

1272
01:06:28,100 --> 01:06:29,380
Do you feel this tragedy...

1273
01:06:29,420 --> 01:06:31,100
is gonna have an effect
on the world of boxing?

1274
01:06:31,140 --> 01:06:33,420
Such a tragedy can't help
but shake the boxing world...

1275
01:06:33,420 --> 01:06:34,780
to its very foundations...

1276
01:06:34,820 --> 01:06:37,260
but par amount importance is
during the sad weeks ahead...

1277
01:06:37,300 --> 01:06:39,220
the eyes of the WBA remain...

1278
01:07:12,940 --> 01:07:14,860
Mia.

1279
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,100
Marsellus?

1280
01:07:17,140 --> 01:07:18,980
I didn't do it, man.

1281
01:07:19,020 --> 01:07:20,980
How you doin'?

1282
01:07:21,020 --> 01:07:24,060
Great.
I never thanked you for dinner.

1283
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:26,740
What you got?

1284
01:07:26,780 --> 01:07:27,700
He booked.

1285
01:07:27,740 --> 01:07:29,180
His trainer?

1286
01:07:29,220 --> 01:07:31,860
Says he don't know nothin'.
I believe him.

1287
01:07:31,900 --> 01:07:33,580
Think Butch surprised
his ass same as us.

1288
01:07:33,620 --> 01:07:36,060
No, we don't wanna think,
we wanna know.

1289
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,100
Take him to the kennel,
sic the dogs on his ass.

1290
01:07:38,140 --> 01:07:40,820
We'll find out for goddamn sure
what he knows and what he don't.

1291
01:07:40,860 --> 01:07:43,300
Butch's search...
how do you want it done?

1292
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:45,940
I'm prepared to scour the earth
for that motherfucker.

1293
01:07:45,980 --> 01:07:47,580
If Butch goes to Indochina...

1294
01:07:47,620 --> 01:07:49,020
I want a nigger hidin'
in a bowl of rice...

1295
01:07:49,060 --> 01:07:51,820
ready to pop a cap
in his ass.

1296
01:07:51,860 --> 01:07:53,700
I will take care of it.

1297
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:04,540
Mister?

1298
01:08:08,380 --> 01:08:09,700
Hey, mister?

1299
01:08:09,740 --> 01:08:10,660
What?

1300
01:08:10,700 --> 01:08:12,460
You were in that fight.

1301
01:08:12,500 --> 01:08:15,340
The fight on the radio.

1302
01:08:15,380 --> 01:08:16,820
You're the fighter?

1303
01:08:16,860 --> 01:08:18,740
Now, what gave you that idea?

1304
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:22,140
No, ho, come on.

1305
01:08:22,180 --> 01:08:23,380
You're him.

1306
01:08:23,420 --> 01:08:25,820
I know you're him.

1307
01:08:27,380 --> 01:08:29,220
Tell me you're him.

1308
01:08:29,260 --> 01:08:31,940
I'm him.

1309
01:08:31,980 --> 01:08:34,460
You killed
the other boxing man.

1310
01:08:38,180 --> 01:08:40,140
He's dead?

1311
01:08:40,180 --> 01:08:42,380
The radio said he was dead.

1312
01:08:45,260 --> 01:08:47,260
Sorry about that, Floyd.

1313
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:50,020
What does it feel like?

1314
01:08:50,020 --> 01:08:52,140
What does what feel like?

1315
01:08:52,180 --> 01:08:54,060
Killing a man.

1316
01:08:56,380 --> 01:09:00,900
Beating another man to death
with your bare hands.

1317
01:09:00,940 --> 01:09:02,540
Are you a weirdo?

1318
01:09:02,580 --> 01:09:04,060
No.

1319
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:06,580
It is a subject
I have much interest in.

1320
01:09:08,340 --> 01:09:11,100
You are the first person
I've met...

1321
01:09:11,140 --> 01:09:12,820
who has killed somebody.

1322
01:09:15,340 --> 01:09:17,180
So...

1323
01:09:17,220 --> 01:09:20,060
what does it feel like
to kill a man?

1324
01:09:20,100 --> 01:09:21,980
I'll tell you what.

1325
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:24,780
You give me one of them
cigarettes you got up there...

1326
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:26,580
and I'll tell you all about it.

1327
01:09:44,500 --> 01:09:46,140
So...

1328
01:09:46,180 --> 01:09:48,780
Esmarelda...

1329
01:09:48,820 --> 01:09:50,980
Villalobos.

1330
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,140
Is that Mexican?

1331
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:55,300
The name is Spanish,
but I am Colombian.

1332
01:09:55,340 --> 01:09:56,940
That's some handle
you got there, honey.

1333
01:09:56,980 --> 01:09:58,820
Thank you.

1334
01:09:58,860 --> 01:10:00,420
And what is your name?

1335
01:10:00,460 --> 01:10:04,540
Butch.

1336
01:10:04,540 --> 01:10:05,900
What does it mean?

1337
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:09,660
I'm an American, honey.
Our names don't mean shit.

1338
01:10:09,700 --> 01:10:13,980
So, moving right along,
Esmarelda.

1339
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:15,980
What is it you wanna know?

1340
01:10:16,020 --> 01:10:19,260
I want to know what it
feels like to kill a man.

1341
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:20,700
I couldn't tell ya.

1342
01:10:26,500 --> 01:10:30,500
I didn't know he was dead
until you told me he was dead.

1343
01:10:30,540 --> 01:10:32,420
Now that I know he's dead...

1344
01:10:32,460 --> 01:10:35,340
you wanna know
how I feel about it?

1345
01:10:38,900 --> 01:10:41,780
I don't feel the least bit bad
about it.

1346
01:10:52,500 --> 01:10:54,460
What the fuck I tell ya, huh?

1347
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:56,820
As soon as the word got out
the fix was in, man...

1348
01:10:56,860 --> 01:10:58,740
the odds went through the roof.

1349
01:10:58,780 --> 01:11:00,380
I know. I know.
Unbelievable.

1350
01:11:00,420 --> 01:11:01,820
Hey, fuck him, Scotty.

1351
01:11:01,820 --> 01:11:04,060
If he was a better boxer,
he'd still be alive.

1352
01:11:04,100 --> 01:11:05,260
He never laced up his gloves...

1353
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:06,940
which he never shoulda done
in the first fuckin' place...

1354
01:11:06,980 --> 01:11:08,820
he'd still be alive.

1355
01:11:10,140 --> 01:11:12,020
Yeah, well...

1356
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:14,020
who gives a fuck?
It's over now.

1357
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:16,580
Well, enough about the poor
unfortunate Mr. Floyd.

1358
01:11:16,620 --> 01:11:19,300
Let's talk about the rich
and prosperous Mr. Butch.

1359
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:23,260
How many bookies
you lay it around on?

1360
01:11:23,260 --> 01:11:24,660
All eight?

1361
01:11:24,700 --> 01:11:26,660
How long to collect?

1362
01:11:26,700 --> 01:11:29,380
So you'll have it all
by tomorrow night?

1363
01:11:29,420 --> 01:11:31,660
No, I understand,
a few stragglers aside.

1364
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,420
Oh, fuck, Scotty,
that is good news...

1365
01:11:33,460 --> 01:11:35,540
that is great news, man.

1366
01:11:35,580 --> 01:11:37,060
Yeah, mm-hmm.

1367
01:11:37,100 --> 01:11:39,700
No, me and Fabienne
are gonna leave in the morning.

1368
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,780
It'll probably take us a couple
of days to get to Knoxville.

1369
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:44,460
OK, my brother.

1370
01:11:45,860 --> 01:11:48,980
You're right.
You're goddamn right.

1371
01:11:49,020 --> 01:11:50,060
All right, Scotty.

1372
01:11:50,100 --> 01:11:52,420
Next time I see you,
we'll be on Tennessee time.

1373
01:11:52,420 --> 01:11:53,820
Be cool, brother.

1374
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:11,140
45.60.

1375
01:12:15,340 --> 01:12:18,900
And, uh, here's a little...
somethin' for the effort.

1376
01:12:18,940 --> 01:12:20,060
Now...

1377
01:12:20,100 --> 01:12:22,860
if anybody asks you
who your fare was tonight...

1378
01:12:22,900 --> 01:12:23,940
what are you gonna say?

1379
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:25,220
The truth.

1380
01:12:25,260 --> 01:12:28,940
Three well-dressed,
slightly toasted Mexicans.

1381
01:12:31,060 --> 01:12:33,380
Bonsoir,
Esmarelda Villalobos.

1382
01:12:33,420 --> 01:12:35,780
Buenas noches, Butch.

1383
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,540
Keep the light off.

1384
01:12:51,580 --> 01:12:53,500
Is that better,
sugar pop?

1385
01:12:53,540 --> 01:12:54,460
Oui.

1386
01:12:58,900 --> 01:13:00,620
Hard day at the office?

1387
01:13:00,660 --> 01:13:02,460
Pretty hard.

1388
01:13:02,500 --> 01:13:04,740
I got in a fight.

1389
01:13:04,780 --> 01:13:07,060
Poor baby.

1390
01:13:07,060 --> 01:13:08,780
Can we make spoons?

1391
01:13:08,820 --> 01:13:11,300
You know what? I was thinkin'
about takin' a shower.

1392
01:13:11,340 --> 01:13:12,980
I'm stinkin' like a dog
over here.

1393
01:13:13,020 --> 01:13:16,340
Mmm. I like the way you stink.

1394
01:13:16,340 --> 01:13:18,180
Let me take this jacket off.

1395
01:13:20,340 --> 01:13:22,860
I was looking at myself
in the mirror.

1396
01:13:22,900 --> 01:13:24,180
Uh-huh.

1397
01:13:24,180 --> 01:13:26,580
I wish I had a pot.

1398
01:13:26,620 --> 01:13:28,860
You were lookin' at yourself
in the mirror...

1399
01:13:28,860 --> 01:13:30,580
and you wish you had some pot?

1400
01:13:30,620 --> 01:13:32,460
A pot.

1401
01:13:32,500 --> 01:13:34,420
A pot belly.

1402
01:13:34,500 --> 01:13:36,540
Pot bellies are sexy.

1403
01:13:36,580 --> 01:13:39,380
Well, you should be happy...

1404
01:13:39,420 --> 01:13:40,860
'cause you have one.

1405
01:13:40,900 --> 01:13:42,180
Shut up, fatso!

1406
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:44,180
I don't have a pot.

1407
01:13:44,220 --> 01:13:45,900
I have a bit of a tummy...

1408
01:13:45,940 --> 01:13:47,740
like Madonna
when she did "Lucky Star."

1409
01:13:47,780 --> 01:13:49,260
It's not the same thing.

1410
01:13:49,300 --> 01:13:50,980
I didn't know
there was such a difference...

1411
01:13:51,020 --> 01:13:52,900
between a pot belly and a tummy.

1412
01:13:52,940 --> 01:13:55,420
The difference is huge.

1413
01:13:56,740 --> 01:13:58,900
Would you like it
if I had a pot belly?

1414
01:13:58,940 --> 01:14:01,660
No. Pot bellies make a man...

1415
01:14:01,700 --> 01:14:04,380
look either oafish
or like a gorilla.

1416
01:14:04,420 --> 01:14:08,260
But on a woman,
a pot belly is very sexy.

1417
01:14:08,300 --> 01:14:09,580
The rest of you is normal.

1418
01:14:09,620 --> 01:14:13,820
Normal face, normal legs,
normal hips, normal ass...

1419
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:17,940
but with a big perfectly
round pot belly.

1420
01:14:17,980 --> 01:14:20,340
If I had one, I'd wear a T-shirt
two sizes too small...

1421
01:14:20,380 --> 01:14:21,900
to accentuate it.

1422
01:14:21,940 --> 01:14:24,820
You think men
would find that attractive?

1423
01:14:24,860 --> 01:14:27,700
I don't give a damn
what men find attractive.

1424
01:14:27,740 --> 01:14:30,020
It's unfortunate what we
find pleasing to the touch...

1425
01:14:30,060 --> 01:14:34,220
and pleasing to the eye
is seldom the same.

1426
01:14:35,980 --> 01:14:37,860
If you had a pot belly...

1427
01:14:37,900 --> 01:14:39,780
I would punch you in it.

1428
01:14:39,820 --> 01:14:42,220
- You'd punch me in my belly?
- Right in the belly.

1429
01:14:42,260 --> 01:14:44,220
Ah! I'd smother you.

1430
01:14:44,260 --> 01:14:47,540
I'd drop it right on your face
till you couldn't breathe.

1431
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,500
You'd do that?

1432
01:14:49,540 --> 01:14:51,060
Yes. Yes.

1433
01:15:05,780 --> 01:15:07,100
Did you get everything?

1434
01:15:07,140 --> 01:15:08,620
Yes, I did.

1435
01:15:08,660 --> 01:15:10,740
Good job, sugar pop.

1436
01:15:10,780 --> 01:15:11,900
Did everything go as planned?

1437
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:13,980
You didn't listen to the... Ow!

1438
01:15:15,420 --> 01:15:16,540
You didn't listen to the radio?

1439
01:15:16,580 --> 01:15:18,460
I never listen to your fights.

1440
01:15:18,500 --> 01:15:19,780
Were you the winner?

1441
01:15:19,820 --> 01:15:22,100
I won, all right.

1442
01:15:22,140 --> 01:15:23,660
Are you still retiring?

1443
01:15:23,700 --> 01:15:24,980
Sure am.

1444
01:15:25,020 --> 01:15:27,300
So, it all worked out
in the finish?

1445
01:15:27,340 --> 01:15:30,620
We're not at the finish yet,
baby.

1446
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,260
Mmm.

1447
01:15:39,700 --> 01:15:42,140
We're in a lot of danger,
aren't we?

1448
01:15:43,220 --> 01:15:46,340
If they find us,
they'll kill us, won't they?

1449
01:15:48,660 --> 01:15:50,900
But they won't find us,
will they?

1450
01:15:54,340 --> 01:15:57,180
Do you still want me
to go with you?

1451
01:15:58,420 --> 01:16:02,820
I don't want to be a burden
or a nuisance, it's...

1452
01:16:08,380 --> 01:16:10,020
Say it.

1453
01:16:11,140 --> 01:16:13,020
Fabienne...

1454
01:16:13,060 --> 01:16:15,500
I want you to be with me.

1455
01:16:16,540 --> 01:16:17,780
Forever?

1456
01:16:17,820 --> 01:16:19,380
Forever and ever.

1457
01:16:21,340 --> 01:16:23,100
Do you love me?

1458
01:16:23,140 --> 01:16:25,020
Very, very much.

1459
01:16:27,380 --> 01:16:28,620
Mmm.

1460
01:16:30,900 --> 01:16:32,340
Butch?

1461
01:16:32,380 --> 01:16:33,420
Yes.

1462
01:16:34,500 --> 01:16:37,140
Will you give me oral pleasure?

1463
01:16:38,460 --> 01:16:39,900
Will you kiss it?

1464
01:16:42,100 --> 01:16:43,700
But you first.

1465
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:47,060
OK.

1466
01:16:47,100 --> 01:16:48,300
Mmm.

1467
01:16:53,620 --> 01:16:55,180
Mmm.

1468
01:16:56,860 --> 01:16:59,300
Butch.

1469
01:16:59,340 --> 01:17:02,180
Mon amour.
L'aventure commence.

1470
01:17:03,940 --> 01:17:05,340
Mmm.

1471
01:17:17,620 --> 01:17:20,060
I think I cracked a rib.

1472
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:21,380
Giving me oral pleasure?

1473
01:17:21,420 --> 01:17:23,020
No, retard. From the fight.

1474
01:17:23,060 --> 01:17:24,300
Don't call me retard.

1475
01:17:24,340 --> 01:17:26,340
My name is Fabby.

1476
01:17:26,380 --> 01:17:27,620
My name is Fabienne.

1477
01:17:27,660 --> 01:17:28,900
Stop it. Stop it.

1478
01:17:28,940 --> 01:17:30,220
My name is Fabienne.

1479
01:17:30,260 --> 01:17:31,420
Shut up, fuckhead!

1480
01:17:31,460 --> 01:17:33,300
I hate that mongoloid voice.

1481
01:17:33,300 --> 01:17:36,340
OK, OK. Sorry, sorry, sorry.

1482
01:17:37,380 --> 01:17:38,660
I take it back.

1483
01:17:41,460 --> 01:17:44,580
Would you hand me a dry towel,
Miss Beautiful Tulip?

1484
01:17:44,620 --> 01:17:46,180
Oh, I like that.

1485
01:17:46,220 --> 01:17:48,220
I like being called a tulip.

1486
01:17:48,260 --> 01:17:50,380
Tulip is much better
than mongoloid.

1487
01:17:50,420 --> 01:17:51,820
I didn't call you a mongoloid.

1488
01:17:51,860 --> 01:17:55,540
I called you a retard,
and I took it back.

1489
01:17:55,580 --> 01:17:56,500
Uhh.

1490
01:17:56,540 --> 01:17:57,780
Butch?

1491
01:17:57,820 --> 01:17:59,540
Yes, lemon pie.

1492
01:17:59,540 --> 01:18:00,820
Where are we going to go?

1493
01:18:00,860 --> 01:18:03,020
Well, I'm not sure yet.

1494
01:18:03,060 --> 01:18:05,180
Wherever you want.

1495
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,100
We're gonna get
a lot of money from this...

1496
01:18:07,100 --> 01:18:09,100
but it ain't gonna be
the kinda money...

1497
01:18:09,140 --> 01:18:13,060
that we can live like hogs
in the fat house forever.

1498
01:18:13,100 --> 01:18:14,980
I was thinkin' maybe
we could go down...

1499
01:18:15,060 --> 01:18:17,300
someplace
in the South Pacific.

1500
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:18,460
The kinda money
we're gonna have...

1501
01:18:18,500 --> 01:18:20,500
is gonna carry us
a long way down there.

1502
01:18:20,540 --> 01:18:22,060
If we wanted,
we could live in Bora Bora?

1503
01:18:22,100 --> 01:18:23,460
You betcha.

1504
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:25,700
And if after a while
you didn't dig that...

1505
01:18:25,740 --> 01:18:28,900
go someplace else,
maybe Tahiti. Mexico.

1506
01:18:28,940 --> 01:18:30,820
But I do not speak Spanish.

1507
01:18:30,860 --> 01:18:33,820
Well, you do not speak
Bora Boran, either.

1508
01:18:33,860 --> 01:18:35,780
Besides, Mexican is easy.

1509
01:18:35,820 --> 01:18:37,380
Donde esta el zapateria?

1510
01:18:37,420 --> 01:18:38,660
What does that mean?

1511
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,420
Where is the shoe store?

1512
01:18:40,460 --> 01:18:41,580
Donde esta...

1513
01:18:41,620 --> 01:18:42,820
Spit, please.

1514
01:18:43,980 --> 01:18:45,820
Donde esta el zapateria?

1515
01:18:45,860 --> 01:18:47,940
Excellent pronunciation.

1516
01:18:47,980 --> 01:18:49,340
Mmm.

1517
01:18:49,380 --> 01:18:51,980
You'll be my little mamacita
in no time.

1518
01:18:53,140 --> 01:18:55,420
Que hor a es?

1519
01:18:55,460 --> 01:18:57,620
What time is it?

1520
01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:58,900
Time for bed.

1521
01:19:00,220 --> 01:19:02,020
Sweet dreams, jellybean.

1522
01:19:09,460 --> 01:19:10,580
Butch?

1523
01:19:16,980 --> 01:19:18,380
Never mind.

1524
01:19:25,420 --> 01:19:26,980
Ohh!

1525
01:19:27,020 --> 01:19:28,940
Merde.

1526
01:19:28,980 --> 01:19:30,620
You startled me.

1527
01:19:30,660 --> 01:19:32,980
Did you have a bad dream?

1528
01:19:35,020 --> 01:19:36,300
Shit.

1529
01:19:41,940 --> 01:19:43,660
What is this you're watching?

1530
01:19:43,700 --> 01:19:46,380
A motorcycle movie.

1531
01:19:46,420 --> 01:19:48,020
I'm not sure the name.

1532
01:19:49,780 --> 01:19:50,980
Are you watchin' it?

1533
01:19:50,980 --> 01:19:54,460
In a way.

1534
01:19:54,500 --> 01:19:56,100
It's a little early
in the morning...

1535
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,460
for explosions and war.

1536
01:20:00,340 --> 01:20:01,580
What was it about?

1537
01:20:01,620 --> 01:20:03,300
How should I know, Fabienne?

1538
01:20:03,340 --> 01:20:05,420
You were the one
who was watchin' it.

1539
01:20:05,460 --> 01:20:07,500
No, imbecile,
what was your dream about?

1540
01:20:07,540 --> 01:20:10,860
I don't know. I don't remember.

1541
01:20:10,900 --> 01:20:13,460
It's really rare
that I remember my dreams.

1542
01:20:13,500 --> 01:20:15,500
Well, let's look
at the grumpy man...

1543
01:20:15,540 --> 01:20:17,180
in the morning.

1544
01:20:17,220 --> 01:20:18,980
- Mmm.
- Mmm.

1545
01:20:19,020 --> 01:20:21,380
Why don't you get up
and we'll get some breakfast?

1546
01:20:21,420 --> 01:20:23,620
One more kiss,
and I'll get up.

1547
01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,180
Mmm.

1548
01:20:26,220 --> 01:20:27,260
Satisfied?

1549
01:20:27,300 --> 01:20:29,660
Yep.

1550
01:20:29,740 --> 01:20:32,980
Then get up, lazy bones.

1551
01:20:33,020 --> 01:20:34,220
Ohh.

1552
01:20:35,220 --> 01:20:37,260
God. Unh.

1553
01:20:37,300 --> 01:20:38,740
What time is it?

1554
01:20:38,740 --> 01:20:40,860
Almost 9:00 in the morning.

1555
01:20:40,900 --> 01:20:42,900
What time does our train arrive?

1556
01:20:42,940 --> 01:20:44,300
11:00.

1557
01:20:44,340 --> 01:20:46,300
You know what I'm gonna
have for breakfast?

1558
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:48,740
What, lemon pie?

1559
01:20:48,780 --> 01:20:51,220
I'm gonna order a big plate...

1560
01:20:51,260 --> 01:20:54,500
of blueberry pancakes
with maple syrup...

1561
01:20:54,540 --> 01:20:57,820
eggs over easy,
and five sausages.

1562
01:20:57,900 --> 01:21:00,260
Anything to drink with that?

1563
01:21:00,300 --> 01:21:02,340
Ah, that looks nice.

1564
01:21:03,460 --> 01:21:04,780
To drink...

1565
01:21:04,820 --> 01:21:09,340
a tall glass of orange juice
and a black cup of coffee.

1566
01:21:09,380 --> 01:21:11,980
After that, I'm going to
have a slice of pie.

1567
01:21:12,020 --> 01:21:13,900
Pie for breakfast?

1568
01:21:13,940 --> 01:21:17,620
Any time of the day
is a good time for pie.

1569
01:21:17,660 --> 01:21:19,780
Blueberry pie
to go with the pancakes.

1570
01:21:19,820 --> 01:21:23,620
And on top, a thin slice
of melted cheese...

1571
01:21:23,660 --> 01:21:24,780
Where's my watch?

1572
01:21:29,940 --> 01:21:32,020
It's there.

1573
01:21:32,060 --> 01:21:34,060
No, it's not.

1574
01:21:34,100 --> 01:21:35,100
Have you looked?

1575
01:21:35,140 --> 01:21:36,140
Yes, I fucking looked.

1576
01:21:36,180 --> 01:21:38,900
What the fuck
do you think I'm doing?

1577
01:21:38,940 --> 01:21:40,620
You sure you got it?

1578
01:21:40,660 --> 01:21:42,900
Yes. Bedside table drawer.

1579
01:21:42,940 --> 01:21:44,460
On the little kangaroo?

1580
01:21:44,500 --> 01:21:45,980
Yes.
It was on the little kangaroo.

1581
01:21:46,020 --> 01:21:49,100
Yeah, well, it's not here now.

1582
01:21:50,140 --> 01:21:51,900
Well, it should be.

1583
01:21:51,900 --> 01:21:54,620
It most definitely should be,
but it's not here now.

1584
01:21:54,660 --> 01:21:55,620
So where the fuck is it?

1585
01:22:01,060 --> 01:22:02,620
Fabienne...

1586
01:22:02,660 --> 01:22:05,540
that was my father's
fucking watch.

1587
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,020
Do you have any idea
what he had to go through...

1588
01:22:08,060 --> 01:22:10,020
to get me that watch?

1589
01:22:10,060 --> 01:22:12,340
I don't have time to go into it,
but he went through a lot.

1590
01:22:12,380 --> 01:22:13,860
All this other shit
you could set on fire...

1591
01:22:13,940 --> 01:22:18,580
but I specifically reminded you
not to forget the fucking watch!

1592
01:22:18,620 --> 01:22:19,540
Now think.

1593
01:22:19,580 --> 01:22:21,900
Did you get it?

1594
01:22:21,940 --> 01:22:22,940
I believe so.

1595
01:22:22,980 --> 01:22:24,340
You believe so?
What the fuck does that mean?

1596
01:22:24,380 --> 01:22:26,220
You either did,
or you didn't get it!

1597
01:22:28,100 --> 01:22:29,380
Then I did.

1598
01:22:31,540 --> 01:22:32,580
Are you sure?

1599
01:22:34,540 --> 01:22:35,460
No.

1600
01:22:37,700 --> 01:22:39,380
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

1601
01:22:39,420 --> 01:22:40,820
Motherfucker!

1602
01:22:40,860 --> 01:22:43,060
- Motherfucker!
- Aah!

1603
01:22:43,100 --> 01:22:46,180
Do you know how
fucking stupid you fucking are?

1604
01:22:46,220 --> 01:22:48,100
No!

1605
01:22:50,620 --> 01:22:52,540
It's not your fault.

1606
01:22:57,380 --> 01:23:00,780
If you left it
at the apartment...

1607
01:23:05,060 --> 01:23:08,180
If you left it at the apartment,
it's not your fault.

1608
01:23:10,260 --> 01:23:13,140
I had you bring
a bunch of stuff.

1609
01:23:15,500 --> 01:23:18,340
I reminded you about it,
but I didn't illustrate...

1610
01:23:18,380 --> 01:23:21,780
how personal the watch
was to me.

1611
01:23:21,820 --> 01:23:23,100
If all I gave a fuck about
was the watch...

1612
01:23:23,140 --> 01:23:26,220
I should've told you that.

1613
01:23:26,260 --> 01:23:29,500
You're not a mind reader,
are you?

1614
01:23:39,940 --> 01:23:41,460
I... I'm sorry.

1615
01:23:41,540 --> 01:23:43,420
Don't be.

1616
01:23:43,460 --> 01:23:45,060
It just means
I can't have breakfast with you.

1617
01:23:46,420 --> 01:23:47,700
Why does it mean that?

1618
01:23:50,620 --> 01:23:53,380
Because I got to go back to
my apartment and get my watch.

1619
01:23:54,940 --> 01:23:56,940
Won't the gangsters
be looking for you there?

1620
01:23:56,980 --> 01:23:58,660
Well...

1621
01:23:58,700 --> 01:24:01,060
that's what I'm going
to find out.

1622
01:24:01,100 --> 01:24:04,260
If they are and I don't think
I can handle it...

1623
01:24:04,300 --> 01:24:05,380
Then I'll split.

1624
01:24:05,420 --> 01:24:09,220
I saw your watch.
I thought I brought it.

1625
01:24:09,260 --> 01:24:10,420
I'm so sorry.

1626
01:24:15,420 --> 01:24:17,580
Here's some money.

1627
01:24:17,620 --> 01:24:19,740
Go out and get those pancakes.
Have a nice breakfast.

1628
01:24:19,780 --> 01:24:21,020
I'll take your Honda.

1629
01:24:21,060 --> 01:24:22,980
I'll be back before
you can say blueberry pie.

1630
01:24:23,020 --> 01:24:24,500
Blueberry pie.

1631
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,420
Maybe not that fast...

1632
01:24:28,460 --> 01:24:30,300
but pretty fast, OK?

1633
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,460
OK.

1634
01:24:31,500 --> 01:24:33,620
Bye.

1635
01:24:33,660 --> 01:24:36,420
Shit! Of all the fucking things
she could fucking forget...

1636
01:24:36,460 --> 01:24:38,100
she forgets my father's watch!

1637
01:24:38,140 --> 01:24:39,980
I specifically reminded her.

1638
01:24:40,020 --> 01:24:42,420
"Bedside table,
on the kangaroo."

1639
01:24:42,460 --> 01:24:45,620
I said the words, "Don't forget
my father's watch."

1640
01:27:16,500 --> 01:27:17,900
Lookin' good, Butch.

1641
01:28:07,340 --> 01:28:09,260
Aah!

1642
01:30:09,180 --> 01:30:11,220
Flowers on the wall

1643
01:30:11,260 --> 01:30:14,740
That don't bother me at all

1644
01:30:14,780 --> 01:30:17,020
Playin' solitaire till dawn

1645
01:30:17,060 --> 01:30:19,700
With a deck of 51

1646
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,340
That's how you're going
to beat 'em, Butch.

1647
01:30:22,380 --> 01:30:23,700
They keep underestimating you.

1648
01:30:23,740 --> 01:30:25,020
Kangaroo

1649
01:30:25,060 --> 01:30:26,900
Now, don't tell me

1650
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:31,740
Countin' flowers on the wall

1651
01:30:31,780 --> 01:30:34,580
That don't bother me at all

1652
01:30:34,620 --> 01:30:36,180
Playin'...

1653
01:30:36,220 --> 01:30:37,820
Solitaire till dawn

1654
01:30:37,860 --> 01:30:40,460
With a deck of 51

1655
01:30:40,500 --> 01:30:42,700
Smoking cigarettes

1656
01:30:42,740 --> 01:30:45,540
And watching "Captain Kangaroo"

1657
01:30:45,580 --> 01:30:48,100
Now, don't tell me

1658
01:30:48,140 --> 01:30:50,300
I've nothin' to do

1659
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:52,620
It's good to see you,
I must go

1660
01:30:52,620 --> 01:30:54,620
I know I look a fright

1661
01:30:54,660 --> 01:30:57,060
Motherfucker.

1662
01:30:59,460 --> 01:31:00,620
Huhh!

1663
01:31:08,820 --> 01:31:09,740
He's dead.

1664
01:31:09,780 --> 01:31:10,700
Oh, my God.

1665
01:31:10,740 --> 01:31:11,820
He's dead.

1666
01:31:21,660 --> 01:31:23,940
If you need someone to go
to court, I'll be glad to help.

1667
01:31:23,980 --> 01:31:25,060
That guy was a drunken maniac.

1668
01:31:25,100 --> 01:31:27,820
He hit you, and then he
crashed into that car.

1669
01:31:27,860 --> 01:31:28,820
Who?

1670
01:31:28,900 --> 01:31:29,820
Him.

1671
01:31:33,980 --> 01:31:35,860
I'll be damned.

1672
01:31:39,100 --> 01:31:40,060
Uhh.

1673
01:31:47,860 --> 01:31:50,780
Aah! Aah! Uhh!

1674
01:31:50,820 --> 01:31:52,020
Aah!

1675
01:31:52,060 --> 01:31:54,020
I'm shot!

1676
01:31:54,020 --> 01:31:54,940
Uhh!

1677
01:31:58,660 --> 01:31:59,580
Uhh!

1678
01:32:06,740 --> 01:32:08,060
Uhh!

1679
01:32:14,980 --> 01:32:18,500
- Can I help you with something?
- Shut the fuck up.

1680
01:32:18,540 --> 01:32:20,860
Now, you just wait
a goddamn minute now.

1681
01:32:20,900 --> 01:32:22,940
What the fuck are you up to?

1682
01:32:22,980 --> 01:32:24,340
Come here, motherfucker!

1683
01:32:24,380 --> 01:32:25,460
- Uhh!
- Uhh!

1684
01:32:25,500 --> 01:32:26,820
Uhh!

1685
01:32:26,860 --> 01:32:28,580
You feel that sting,
big boy, huh?

1686
01:32:28,620 --> 01:32:30,220
That's pride
fucking with you, see?

1687
01:32:30,260 --> 01:32:32,180
You got to fight
through that shit.

1688
01:32:32,220 --> 01:32:33,580
Uhh! Huh?

1689
01:32:33,620 --> 01:32:34,780
You better kill me.

1690
01:32:34,820 --> 01:32:36,700
Yeah,
somebody's going to get killed.

1691
01:32:36,740 --> 01:32:39,060
Somebody's going to get their
motherfucking head blown to...

1692
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:41,500
Hold it right there,
God damn it.

1693
01:32:41,540 --> 01:32:43,380
This ain't none
of your business, mister.

1694
01:32:43,380 --> 01:32:45,220
I'm making it my business.

1695
01:32:45,260 --> 01:32:46,180
Toss the weapon.

1696
01:32:46,220 --> 01:32:47,900
You don't understand, man.

1697
01:32:47,940 --> 01:32:49,940
Toss the weapon.

1698
01:32:56,340 --> 01:32:57,900
Take your foot off the nigger.

1699
01:32:57,940 --> 01:32:59,580
Put your hands behind your head.

1700
01:32:59,580 --> 01:33:01,900
Approach the counter right now.

1701
01:33:01,940 --> 01:33:04,820
This motherfucker's
trying to kill me.

1702
01:33:04,820 --> 01:33:06,140
Shut up.

1703
01:33:06,180 --> 01:33:08,620
Keep a-comin'. Come on.

1704
01:33:08,660 --> 01:33:09,620
Uhh!

1705
01:33:32,500 --> 01:33:34,460
Zed, it's Maynard.

1706
01:33:35,540 --> 01:33:37,980
Yeah. The spider
just caught a couple flies.

1707
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:28,180
Nobody kills anybody in my place
of business except me or Zed.

1708
01:34:32,100 --> 01:34:33,500
That's Zed.

1709
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:47,740
I thought you said
you waited for me.

1710
01:34:47,780 --> 01:34:49,220
I did.

1711
01:34:54,180 --> 01:34:56,660
So how come
they're all beat up?

1712
01:34:56,700 --> 01:34:58,860
They did that
to each other, man.

1713
01:34:58,900 --> 01:35:00,180
They came in fighting.

1714
01:35:00,220 --> 01:35:04,140
Now, this one right here,
he was going to shoot that one.

1715
01:35:04,180 --> 01:35:05,100
Is that right?

1716
01:35:05,140 --> 01:35:07,660
You going to shoot him, boy?

1717
01:35:08,820 --> 01:35:10,220
Huh?

1718
01:35:12,300 --> 01:35:15,460
Hey, is Grace all right
out front?

1719
01:35:15,500 --> 01:35:17,140
Yeah. It ain't Tuesday, is it?

1720
01:35:17,180 --> 01:35:18,460
No. It's Thursday.

1721
01:35:18,500 --> 01:35:20,060
She ought to be fine.

1722
01:35:20,060 --> 01:35:21,020
Mm-hmm.

1723
01:35:22,380 --> 01:35:23,940
Ahh. Well...

1724
01:35:25,060 --> 01:35:27,580
Bring out The Gimp.

1725
01:35:27,620 --> 01:35:30,140
I think The Gimp's sleeping.

1726
01:35:30,180 --> 01:35:34,180
I guess you'll just have to go
wake him up, now, won't you?

1727
01:36:11,780 --> 01:36:12,740
Get up.

1728
01:36:25,860 --> 01:36:27,340
Get down.

1729
01:36:37,660 --> 01:36:39,020
Which one of 'em
you want to do first?

1730
01:36:41,540 --> 01:36:43,940
I ain't for sure yet.

1731
01:36:47,420 --> 01:36:50,900
Eenie, meenie, minie, mo.

1732
01:36:50,900 --> 01:36:54,980
Catch a nigger by the toe.

1733
01:36:54,980 --> 01:36:56,700
If he hollers...

1734
01:36:56,740 --> 01:36:58,660
let him go.

1735
01:36:58,660 --> 01:37:01,740
Eenie, meenie...

1736
01:37:01,780 --> 01:37:03,700
minie, mo.

1737
01:37:05,580 --> 01:37:08,700
My mother said...

1738
01:37:08,740 --> 01:37:12,020
To pick the perfect one...

1739
01:37:12,060 --> 01:37:15,100
and you are...

1740
01:37:17,260 --> 01:37:18,700
It.

1741
01:37:20,380 --> 01:37:21,780
I guess that means you,
big boy.

1742
01:37:24,220 --> 01:37:25,500
Shh.

1743
01:37:26,660 --> 01:37:28,540
You want to do it in here?

1744
01:37:28,580 --> 01:37:31,780
No. Let's do it back there
in Russell's old room.

1745
01:37:31,820 --> 01:37:34,460
Sounds good to me.

1746
01:37:41,700 --> 01:37:43,740
Uhh. Uhh.

1747
01:37:56,900 --> 01:38:00,740
You keep an eye on this one.

1748
01:38:20,220 --> 01:38:21,140
Yeah!

1749
01:38:21,180 --> 01:38:22,100
Uhh!

1750
01:38:27,660 --> 01:38:28,620
Yeah!

1751
01:38:32,060 --> 01:38:33,100
Yeah, go!

1752
01:38:33,140 --> 01:38:35,100
Come on, motherfucker!

1753
01:38:35,140 --> 01:38:36,780
Now, motherfucker!

1754
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:41,900
Come on!

1755
01:38:41,900 --> 01:38:42,820
Yeah!

1756
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:47,340
Uhh! Uhh! Aah!

1757
01:38:47,380 --> 01:38:48,660
Aah!

1758
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:51,700
Yeah!

1759
01:38:58,700 --> 01:39:00,140
Yeah!

1760
01:39:02,500 --> 01:39:03,900
Yeah!

1761
01:39:07,700 --> 01:39:08,860
Yee!

1762
01:39:08,940 --> 01:39:10,420
Yee-haw!

1763
01:39:11,620 --> 01:39:12,740
Go!

1764
01:39:14,180 --> 01:39:16,380
Come on, motherfucker!

1765
01:39:16,420 --> 01:39:17,980
Aah!

1766
01:39:18,020 --> 01:39:20,460
Uhh! Uhh! Uhh!

1767
01:39:20,500 --> 01:39:21,900
Come on!

1768
01:39:30,260 --> 01:39:31,700
Yeah!

1769
01:39:37,860 --> 01:39:38,780
Yeah!

1770
01:39:44,460 --> 01:39:45,420
Uhh!

1771
01:39:52,220 --> 01:39:54,460
Now, motherfucker!

1772
01:39:54,460 --> 01:39:56,100
Aah!

1773
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,420
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

1774
01:39:58,460 --> 01:39:59,940
Come on!

1775
01:39:59,980 --> 01:40:01,180
Now!

1776
01:40:06,580 --> 01:40:07,540
Yeah!

1777
01:40:14,940 --> 01:40:15,900
Yeah!

1778
01:40:24,060 --> 01:40:25,180
Yeah!

1779
01:40:25,220 --> 01:40:26,660
Yeah, baby!

1780
01:40:41,620 --> 01:40:43,620
Shut the fuck up!

1781
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:48,260
Fuck!

1782
01:40:50,980 --> 01:40:52,420
Come on!

1783
01:40:57,980 --> 01:40:59,020
Yeah.

1784
01:41:08,860 --> 01:41:10,300
Haah!

1785
01:41:15,660 --> 01:41:16,620
Aah!

1786
01:41:19,180 --> 01:41:20,100
Ohh!

1787
01:41:24,140 --> 01:41:25,540
Ohh! Uhh!

1788
01:41:29,020 --> 01:41:30,900
You want that gun,
don't you, Zed?

1789
01:41:35,580 --> 01:41:37,140
Go ahead and pick it up.

1790
01:41:39,580 --> 01:41:41,700
Go ahead, pick it up.

1791
01:41:44,060 --> 01:41:46,260
Come on. Atta boy.

1792
01:41:47,900 --> 01:41:50,500
I want you to pick it up...

1793
01:41:50,540 --> 01:41:51,540
Zed.

1794
01:41:55,740 --> 01:41:58,700
Step aside, Butch.

1795
01:42:03,060 --> 01:42:05,020
Uhh!

1796
01:42:10,420 --> 01:42:13,740
Fuck!

1797
01:42:16,220 --> 01:42:17,660
You OK?

1798
01:42:20,180 --> 01:42:21,460
No, man.

1799
01:42:22,940 --> 01:42:25,140
I'm pretty fucking far from OK.

1800
01:42:25,180 --> 01:42:26,580
Uhh!

1801
01:42:32,860 --> 01:42:34,340
Aah!

1802
01:42:36,580 --> 01:42:38,020
What now?

1803
01:42:39,620 --> 01:42:40,980
Uhh!

1804
01:42:41,020 --> 01:42:42,460
What now?

1805
01:42:43,900 --> 01:42:46,340
Let me tell you what now.

1806
01:42:47,540 --> 01:42:50,340
I'm going to call a couple
of hard pipe-hitting niggers...

1807
01:42:50,380 --> 01:42:52,620
to go to work
on the homes here...

1808
01:42:52,660 --> 01:42:57,780
with a pair of pliers
and a blow torch.

1809
01:42:57,780 --> 01:43:00,300
You hear me talking,
hillbilly boy?

1810
01:43:01,740 --> 01:43:03,980
I ain't through
with you by a damn sight.

1811
01:43:04,020 --> 01:43:07,860
I'm going to get
medieval on your ass.

1812
01:43:10,500 --> 01:43:13,340
I meant, what now
between me and you?

1813
01:43:17,940 --> 01:43:19,860
Oh, that what now.

1814
01:43:21,500 --> 01:43:25,820
I tell you what now
between me and you.

1815
01:43:26,780 --> 01:43:29,660
There is no me and you...

1816
01:43:30,940 --> 01:43:32,380
not no more.

1817
01:43:35,860 --> 01:43:37,780
So are we cool?

1818
01:43:39,060 --> 01:43:40,940
Yeah, we cool.

1819
01:43:41,940 --> 01:43:43,340
Two things...

1820
01:43:44,940 --> 01:43:47,340
Don't tell nobody about this.

1821
01:43:49,100 --> 01:43:52,500
This shit is between me, you...

1822
01:43:52,540 --> 01:43:54,060
and Mr. Soon To Be Living...

1823
01:43:54,140 --> 01:43:57,020
The Rest Of His Short-Ass Life
In Agonizing Pain...

1824
01:43:57,060 --> 01:43:58,500
rapist here.

1825
01:43:59,980 --> 01:44:02,780
It ain't nobody else's business.

1826
01:44:02,820 --> 01:44:04,620
Two...

1827
01:44:04,660 --> 01:44:07,140
You leave town tonight...

1828
01:44:07,180 --> 01:44:09,340
right now.

1829
01:44:09,380 --> 01:44:11,220
And when you're gone...

1830
01:44:11,260 --> 01:44:13,940
you stay gone...
or you be gone.

1831
01:44:15,900 --> 01:44:19,340
You lost all your L.A.
Privileges. Deal?

1832
01:44:20,700 --> 01:44:21,660
Deal.

1833
01:44:23,900 --> 01:44:26,780
Get your ass out of here.

1834
01:44:36,380 --> 01:44:38,340
Ohh!

1835
01:44:42,180 --> 01:44:43,460
Uhh!

1836
01:45:24,980 --> 01:45:26,380
Fabienne!

1837
01:45:28,140 --> 01:45:29,180
Fabienne!

1838
01:45:32,060 --> 01:45:34,100
Fabienne.
Come on, baby, come on.

1839
01:45:34,140 --> 01:45:35,900
Get your shit.
We got to go right now.

1840
01:45:35,940 --> 01:45:37,900
I was so worried.
What about our bags?

1841
01:45:37,940 --> 01:45:39,420
Fuck the bags.
If we don't split right now...

1842
01:45:39,460 --> 01:45:41,180
we'll miss the train.
I'll be downstairs.

1843
01:45:41,220 --> 01:45:42,500
Is everything well?

1844
01:45:42,540 --> 01:45:44,340
Just come on!
No talking now.

1845
01:45:44,380 --> 01:45:47,540
Are we in danger?

1846
01:45:50,020 --> 01:45:51,820
Come on, honey!

1847
01:45:54,540 --> 01:45:56,100
Where did you get
this motorcycle?

1848
01:45:56,140 --> 01:45:57,980
It's not a motorcycle, baby.
It's a chopper.

1849
01:45:58,020 --> 01:45:59,300
Come on, let's go.

1850
01:45:59,340 --> 01:46:00,540
What happened to my Honda?

1851
01:46:00,580 --> 01:46:02,900
I'm sorry, baby.
I had to crash that Honda.

1852
01:46:02,940 --> 01:46:04,220
Will you come on now, please?

1853
01:46:04,260 --> 01:46:07,540
Come on,
let's go, let's go.

1854
01:46:10,860 --> 01:46:12,220
You're hurt?

1855
01:46:12,260 --> 01:46:13,780
No, no.
I might've broken my nose.

1856
01:46:13,780 --> 01:46:15,700
It's no biggie.
Come on, hop on.

1857
01:46:15,740 --> 01:46:17,260
Baby, please.

1858
01:46:17,300 --> 01:46:20,180
Honey, we got to hit
the fucking road. Get on.

1859
01:46:22,900 --> 01:46:24,740
I'm sorry.
Come here, come here.

1860
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:28,180
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

1861
01:46:28,220 --> 01:46:31,300
You were gone so long I started
to think dreadful thoughts.

1862
01:46:31,340 --> 01:46:32,820
Oh, I'm sorry, sweetie.
I didn't mean to worry you.

1863
01:46:32,860 --> 01:46:35,260
- How was your breakfast?
- It was good.

1864
01:46:35,260 --> 01:46:37,020
Did you get
the blueberry pancakes?

1865
01:46:37,060 --> 01:46:38,460
They didn't have
blueberry pancakes.

1866
01:46:38,540 --> 01:46:40,420
I had to get buttermilk.
Are you sure you're OK?

1867
01:46:40,460 --> 01:46:43,220
Honey, since I left you,
this has been without a doubt...

1868
01:46:43,260 --> 01:46:45,060
the single weirdest
fucking day of my life.

1869
01:46:45,100 --> 01:46:46,780
Come on, hop on.
I'll tell you all about it.

1870
01:46:46,820 --> 01:46:49,140
Come on, get on. Gotta go.

1871
01:46:49,140 --> 01:46:52,020
Whose motorcycle is this?

1872
01:46:52,060 --> 01:46:53,140
It's a chopper, baby.

1873
01:46:53,180 --> 01:46:55,180
- Whose chopper is this?
- Zed's.

1874
01:46:55,220 --> 01:46:58,140
- Who's Zed?
- Zed's dead, baby.

1875
01:46:58,180 --> 01:46:59,820
Zed's dead.

1876
01:47:14,460 --> 01:47:16,420
Yes, you did, Brett!

1877
01:47:16,460 --> 01:47:18,420
- You tried to fuck him.
- No.

1878
01:47:18,420 --> 01:47:20,020
And Marsellus Wallace
don't like to be fucked...

1879
01:47:20,060 --> 01:47:22,860
by anybody except Mrs. Wallace.

1880
01:47:22,900 --> 01:47:24,220
Oh, God, please.
I don't want to die.

1881
01:47:24,260 --> 01:47:25,460
You read the Bible, Brett?

1882
01:47:25,500 --> 01:47:26,820
Yes!

1883
01:47:26,860 --> 01:47:29,100
Well, there's
this passage I got memorized.

1884
01:47:29,140 --> 01:47:31,020
It sort of fits the occasion.

1885
01:47:31,060 --> 01:47:34,380
"Ezekiel" 25: 17.

1886
01:47:34,420 --> 01:47:36,460
"The path of
the righteous man...

1887
01:47:36,500 --> 01:47:38,620
"is beset on all sides...

1888
01:47:38,660 --> 01:47:40,580
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

1889
01:47:40,620 --> 01:47:43,620
"and the tyranny of evil men.

1890
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,260
"Blessed is he...

1891
01:47:45,300 --> 01:47:48,380
"who in the name
of charity and good will...

1892
01:47:48,380 --> 01:47:49,620
"shepherds the weak...

1893
01:47:49,660 --> 01:47:51,220
"through
the Valley of Darkness...

1894
01:47:51,260 --> 01:47:53,820
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

1895
01:47:53,860 --> 01:47:56,420
"and the finder
of lost children.

1896
01:47:56,460 --> 01:47:59,100
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

1897
01:47:59,140 --> 01:48:02,780
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

1898
01:48:02,820 --> 01:48:05,180
"those who attempt to poison...

1899
01:48:05,220 --> 01:48:07,020
"and destroy My brothers.

1900
01:48:07,060 --> 01:48:10,820
"And you will know
My name is the Lord...

1901
01:48:10,860 --> 01:48:14,100
"when I lay My vengeance
upon thee."

1902
01:48:14,140 --> 01:48:15,540
Uhh!

1903
01:48:16,580 --> 01:48:18,660
Aah!

1904
01:48:21,820 --> 01:48:24,420
I'm fucked. I'm fucked.

1905
01:48:24,460 --> 01:48:26,580
Is he a friend of yours?

1906
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:29,340
Oh, Vincent, Marvin.
Marvin, Vincent.

1907
01:48:29,380 --> 01:48:30,540
Better tell him
to shut the fuck up.

1908
01:48:30,540 --> 01:48:31,980
He's getting on my nerves.

1909
01:48:32,020 --> 01:48:34,180
Marvin. Marvin!

1910
01:48:34,220 --> 01:48:35,980
I'd knock that shit off
if I was you.

1911
01:48:36,980 --> 01:48:39,940
Die, you motherfuckers! Die!

1912
01:49:07,140 --> 01:49:10,180
Why the fuck didn't you tell us
somebody was in the bathroom?

1913
01:49:10,220 --> 01:49:11,620
Slip your mind?

1914
01:49:11,660 --> 01:49:15,060
You forget someone was in there
with a goddamn hand-cannon?

1915
01:49:15,100 --> 01:49:17,020
You see the size
of that gun he fired at us?

1916
01:49:17,060 --> 01:49:19,420
It was bigger than him.

1917
01:49:23,660 --> 01:49:26,180
We should be fucking dead, man.

1918
01:49:26,220 --> 01:49:28,060
I know. We was lucky.

1919
01:49:28,100 --> 01:49:31,060
No, no, no, no.
That shit wasn't luck.

1920
01:49:31,100 --> 01:49:32,380
Yeah, maybe.

1921
01:49:32,420 --> 01:49:35,180
This was divine intervention.

1922
01:49:35,220 --> 01:49:37,100
You know what
divine intervention is?

1923
01:49:43,340 --> 01:49:45,100
I think so.

1924
01:49:45,140 --> 01:49:46,460
That means that God
came down from Heaven...

1925
01:49:46,500 --> 01:49:47,860
and stopped the bullets.

1926
01:49:47,900 --> 01:49:50,300
That's right.
That's exactly what it means.

1927
01:49:50,340 --> 01:49:51,540
God came down from Heaven...

1928
01:49:51,580 --> 01:49:53,260
and stopped
these motherfucking bullets.

1929
01:49:54,420 --> 01:49:56,340
I think it's time for us
to leave, Jules.

1930
01:49:56,380 --> 01:49:58,660
Don't do that. Don't
fucking blow this shit off.

1931
01:49:58,700 --> 01:50:00,820
What just happened here
was a fucking miracle.

1932
01:50:00,860 --> 01:50:02,580
Chill, Jules.
This shit happens.

1933
01:50:02,620 --> 01:50:05,300
Wrong. Wrong.
This shit doesn't just happen.

1934
01:50:05,340 --> 01:50:07,420
Do you want to continue
this theological discussion...

1935
01:50:07,460 --> 01:50:10,900
in a car or in a jailhouse
with the cops?

1936
01:50:10,940 --> 01:50:12,700
We should be fucking dead,
my friend.

1937
01:50:12,740 --> 01:50:15,540
What happened here
was a miracle...

1938
01:50:15,580 --> 01:50:17,780
and I want you to fucking
acknowledge it.

1939
01:50:17,820 --> 01:50:20,900
All right, it was a miracle.

1940
01:50:20,940 --> 01:50:22,380
Can we go now?

1941
01:50:29,260 --> 01:50:30,820
Let's go, nigger. Come on.

1942
01:50:30,860 --> 01:50:32,300
Shit.

1943
01:50:35,100 --> 01:50:36,540
You ever seen
that show "Cops"?

1944
01:50:36,580 --> 01:50:38,620
I was watching it one time,
and there was this cop on...

1945
01:50:38,660 --> 01:50:40,300
and he was talking
about this gunfight...

1946
01:50:40,340 --> 01:50:42,260
he had in a hallway
with this guy, right?

1947
01:50:42,300 --> 01:50:44,180
And he just unloaded
on this guy...

1948
01:50:44,220 --> 01:50:45,980
and nothing happened.
He didn't hit nothing.

1949
01:50:46,020 --> 01:50:48,420
OK? It was just him
and this guy.

1950
01:50:48,460 --> 01:50:50,060
I mean, you know...

1951
01:50:50,100 --> 01:50:52,100
it's freaky, but it happens.

1952
01:50:52,140 --> 01:50:54,580
You want to play blind man,
go walk with the shepherd...

1953
01:50:54,620 --> 01:50:56,900
but me, my eyes
are wide fucking open.

1954
01:50:56,940 --> 01:50:58,620
What the fuck does that mean?

1955
01:50:58,660 --> 01:51:00,380
It means that's it for me.

1956
01:51:00,380 --> 01:51:02,460
From here on in,
you can consider my ass retired.

1957
01:51:02,500 --> 01:51:04,260
- Jesus Christ.
- Don't blaspheme.

1958
01:51:04,300 --> 01:51:06,020
- God damn it.
- I said don't do that.

1959
01:51:06,060 --> 01:51:07,620
Why are you fucking
freaking out on us?

1960
01:51:07,660 --> 01:51:09,500
Look, I'm telling
Marsellus today.

1961
01:51:09,540 --> 01:51:10,620
I'm through.

1962
01:51:10,660 --> 01:51:12,140
Why don't you tell him
at the same time why?

1963
01:51:12,180 --> 01:51:13,420
Don't worry. I will.

1964
01:51:13,460 --> 01:51:14,620
Yeah,
and I'll bet you $10,000...

1965
01:51:14,660 --> 01:51:15,740
he laughs his ass off.

1966
01:51:15,780 --> 01:51:17,380
I don't give a damn
if he does.

1967
01:51:17,420 --> 01:51:21,180
Marvin, what do you make
of all this?

1968
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:22,860
Man, I don't even
have an opinion.

1969
01:51:22,860 --> 01:51:24,460
You got to have an opinion.

1970
01:51:24,500 --> 01:51:26,940
Do you think that God came down
from Heaven and stopped...

1971
01:51:28,140 --> 01:51:31,020
What the fuck's happening?
Oh, shit, man!

1972
01:51:31,060 --> 01:51:32,380
Oh, man,
I shot Marvin in the face.

1973
01:51:32,420 --> 01:51:33,700
Why the fuck did you do that?

1974
01:51:33,740 --> 01:51:35,100
Well, I didn't mean to do it.
It was an accident.

1975
01:51:35,100 --> 01:51:38,100
Oh, man, I've seen some
crazy-ass shit in my time...

1976
01:51:38,140 --> 01:51:39,500
Chill out, man.
I told you it was an accident.

1977
01:51:39,540 --> 01:51:41,180
You probably... You went over
a bump or something.

1978
01:51:41,220 --> 01:51:42,820
Hey, the car didn't hit
no motherfucking bump.

1979
01:51:42,860 --> 01:51:45,340
Hey, look, man, I didn't mean
to shoot the son of a bitch.

1980
01:51:45,340 --> 01:51:46,700
The gun went off.
I don't know why.

1981
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:48,140
Well, look at
this fucking mess, man!

1982
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:49,740
We're on a city street
in broad daylight.

1983
01:51:49,780 --> 01:51:50,700
I can't believe it, man.

1984
01:51:50,740 --> 01:51:51,900
Well, believe it now,
motherfucker.

1985
01:51:51,900 --> 01:51:53,060
We got to get this car
off the road.

1986
01:51:53,100 --> 01:51:54,420
You know,
cops tend to notice shit...

1987
01:51:54,460 --> 01:51:56,500
like you're driving a car
drenched in fucking blood.

1988
01:51:56,540 --> 01:51:57,980
Just take it
to a friendly place, that's all.

1989
01:51:58,020 --> 01:51:59,220
This is the Valley, Vincent.

1990
01:51:59,260 --> 01:52:00,460
Marsellus ain't got
no friendly places.

1991
01:52:00,500 --> 01:52:02,580
Jules, this ain't
my fucking town, man!

1992
01:52:02,620 --> 01:52:05,100
- Shit!
- What you doing?

1993
01:52:05,140 --> 01:52:06,460
I'm calling my partner
in Toluca Lake.

1994
01:52:06,500 --> 01:52:07,900
Where's Toluca Lake?

1995
01:52:07,940 --> 01:52:09,780
It's just over the hill here,
over by Burbank Studios.

1996
01:52:09,820 --> 01:52:11,460
If Jimmie's ass ain't home...

1997
01:52:11,500 --> 01:52:12,900
I don't know what the fuck
we going to do, man...

1998
01:52:12,940 --> 01:52:15,860
'cause I ain't got
no other partners in 818.

1999
01:52:15,900 --> 01:52:17,180
Jimmie, yo,
how you doing, man?

2000
01:52:17,180 --> 01:52:19,540
It's Jules.
Just listen up, man.

2001
01:52:19,580 --> 01:52:21,500
Me and my homeboy are in
some serious fucking shit, man.

2002
01:52:21,540 --> 01:52:23,340
We're in a car, and we got
to get off the road pronto.

2003
01:52:23,380 --> 01:52:25,460
I need to use your garage
for a couple hours.

2004
01:52:26,820 --> 01:52:28,340
We got to be
real fucking delicate...

2005
01:52:28,380 --> 01:52:29,780
with this Jimmie situation.

2006
01:52:29,820 --> 01:52:32,140
He's one remark away from
kicking our asses out the door.

2007
01:52:32,140 --> 01:52:33,220
If he does, what do we do?

2008
01:52:33,260 --> 01:52:35,820
We ain't leaving
till we made a couple calls...

2009
01:52:35,860 --> 01:52:37,340
but I don't want it
to reach that pitch.

2010
01:52:37,380 --> 01:52:38,340
Jimmie's a friend.

2011
01:52:38,420 --> 01:52:39,500
You don't come
into your friend's house...

2012
01:52:39,540 --> 01:52:40,900
and start telling him
what's what.

2013
01:52:40,940 --> 01:52:42,820
Just tell him not
to be abusive, that's all.

2014
01:52:42,860 --> 01:52:45,780
He kind of freaked out
back there when he saw Marvin.

2015
01:52:45,820 --> 01:52:46,900
Well, put yourself
in his position.

2016
01:52:46,940 --> 01:52:48,100
It's 8:00 in the morning.

2017
01:52:48,140 --> 01:52:50,460
He just woke up.
He wasn't expecting this shit.

2018
01:52:50,500 --> 01:52:53,260
Shit, we got to remember here
who's doing who a favor.

2019
01:52:53,260 --> 01:52:55,060
If that favor means
that I got to take shit...

2020
01:52:55,100 --> 01:52:57,620
then he can stick that favor
straight up his ass.

2021
01:52:57,660 --> 01:53:00,180
Nigger, what the fuck
did you just do to his towel?

2022
01:53:00,220 --> 01:53:01,260
I was drying my hands.

2023
01:53:01,300 --> 01:53:02,500
You're supposed
to wash them first.

2024
01:53:02,540 --> 01:53:03,660
You watched me wash them.

2025
01:53:03,700 --> 01:53:05,060
I watched you get them wet.

2026
01:53:05,100 --> 01:53:07,580
I was washing them.
This shit's hard to get off.

2027
01:53:07,620 --> 01:53:09,500
Maybe if he had Lava,
I could've done a better job.

2028
01:53:09,540 --> 01:53:10,940
I used the same
fucking soap you did...

2029
01:53:10,980 --> 01:53:13,820
and the towel didn't look like
no goddamn maxipad.

2030
01:53:13,860 --> 01:53:16,260
What if he was to come in here
and see his towel like this?

2031
01:53:16,300 --> 01:53:18,380
It's shit like this
that'll bring this situation...

2032
01:53:18,420 --> 01:53:20,340
to a head, man.

2033
01:53:21,460 --> 01:53:23,060
Look...

2034
01:53:23,100 --> 01:53:24,740
I ain't threatening you
with nothing, all right?

2035
01:53:24,780 --> 01:53:26,620
You know I respect you
and all...

2036
01:53:26,620 --> 01:53:29,100
but just don't put me
in this position, all right?

2037
01:53:29,140 --> 01:53:31,900
All right. Fine. Fine.

2038
01:53:31,940 --> 01:53:34,660
Ask me nice like that,
no problem.

2039
01:53:34,700 --> 01:53:37,380
Just go handle your friend.
Go ahead. I don't care.

2040
01:53:39,220 --> 01:53:41,900
Mmm. Goddamn, Jimmie.

2041
01:53:41,940 --> 01:53:43,820
This is some
serious gourmet shit.

2042
01:53:43,860 --> 01:53:45,700
Me and Vincent
would've been satisfied...

2043
01:53:45,740 --> 01:53:48,580
with some freeze-dried
Taster's Choice, right?

2044
01:53:48,620 --> 01:53:52,220
Heh! And he springs this
serious gourmet shit on us.

2045
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:53,260
What flavor is this?

2046
01:53:53,300 --> 01:53:54,580
Knock it off, Julie.

2047
01:53:54,580 --> 01:53:55,860
What?

2048
01:53:55,900 --> 01:53:58,660
I don't need you to tell me
how fucking good my coffee is.

2049
01:53:58,700 --> 01:54:00,780
I'm the one who buys it.
I know how good it is.

2050
01:54:00,820 --> 01:54:02,900
When Bonnie goes shopping,
she buys shit.

2051
01:54:02,940 --> 01:54:04,540
I buy the gourmet
expensive stuff...

2052
01:54:04,580 --> 01:54:06,580
because when I drink it,
I want to taste it.

2053
01:54:06,620 --> 01:54:08,180
But you know what's
on my mind right now?

2054
01:54:08,220 --> 01:54:10,380
It ain't the coffee
in my kitchen.

2055
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:12,380
It's the dead nigger
in my garage.

2056
01:54:12,420 --> 01:54:14,140
Oh, Jimmie,
don't even worry about it.

2057
01:54:14,180 --> 01:54:16,420
I don't think about anything.
I want to ask you a question.

2058
01:54:16,460 --> 01:54:17,900
When you came pulling in here...

2059
01:54:17,940 --> 01:54:19,340
did you notice a sign
out in the front of my house...

2060
01:54:19,340 --> 01:54:20,780
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2061
01:54:20,860 --> 01:54:22,580
Jimmie, you know
I didn't see no shit...

2062
01:54:22,620 --> 01:54:24,340
Did you notice a sign
in the front of my house...

2063
01:54:24,340 --> 01:54:26,100
that said
"Dead Nigger Storage"?

2064
01:54:26,140 --> 01:54:29,220
No. I didn't.

2065
01:54:29,220 --> 01:54:30,500
You know why
you didn't see that sign?

2066
01:54:30,540 --> 01:54:31,660
Why?

2067
01:54:31,700 --> 01:54:33,060
'Cause it ain't there...

2068
01:54:33,100 --> 01:54:36,060
'cause storing dead niggers
ain't my fucking business!

2069
01:54:36,100 --> 01:54:37,460
Jimmie, we're not going
to store the motherfucker.

2070
01:54:37,500 --> 01:54:40,780
Don't you fucking realize, man,
that if Bonnie comes home...

2071
01:54:40,820 --> 01:54:43,380
and finds a body in her house,
I'm going to get divorced?

2072
01:54:43,420 --> 01:54:45,020
No marriage counselor,
no trial separation.

2073
01:54:45,060 --> 01:54:47,020
I'm going to get
fucking divorced, OK?

2074
01:54:47,060 --> 01:54:49,780
And I don't want
to get fucking divorced.

2075
01:54:49,820 --> 01:54:52,300
Now, man, you know, fuck,
I want to help you...

2076
01:54:52,340 --> 01:54:54,620
but I don't want to lose
my wife doing it, all right?

2077
01:54:54,620 --> 01:54:56,700
Jimmie, she ain't
going to leave you.

2078
01:54:56,740 --> 01:54:58,660
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me,
Jules!

2079
01:54:58,700 --> 01:55:00,980
OK?
Don't fucking "Jimmie" me.

2080
01:55:01,020 --> 01:55:03,260
There's nothing you're gonna say
that's gonna make me forget...

2081
01:55:03,300 --> 01:55:05,420
that I love my wife, is there?

2082
01:55:07,380 --> 01:55:08,620
Look, you know...

2083
01:55:08,660 --> 01:55:12,180
she comes home from work
in about an hour and a half.

2084
01:55:12,220 --> 01:55:14,500
Graveyard shift
at the hospital.

2085
01:55:14,540 --> 01:55:16,580
You got to make
some phone calls?

2086
01:55:16,620 --> 01:55:18,180
You got to call some people?

2087
01:55:18,220 --> 01:55:20,460
Well, then do it, and get
the fuck out of my house...

2088
01:55:20,500 --> 01:55:22,300
before she gets here.

2089
01:55:22,340 --> 01:55:23,340
That's Kool and the Gang.

2090
01:55:23,420 --> 01:55:24,700
We don't want
to fuck your shit up.

2091
01:55:24,740 --> 01:55:27,540
I want to call my people,
get them to bring us in.

2092
01:55:27,580 --> 01:55:30,460
You're fucking my shit up
right now!

2093
01:55:30,500 --> 01:55:33,220
You'll fuck my shit up big time
if Bonnie comes home.

2094
01:55:33,260 --> 01:55:34,740
So just do me that favor,
all right?

2095
01:55:34,780 --> 01:55:36,860
The phone is in my bedroom.
I suggest you get going.

2096
01:55:36,900 --> 01:55:39,980
Well, say she comes home.

2097
01:55:40,020 --> 01:55:43,620
What do you think she'll do?

2098
01:55:43,660 --> 01:55:46,020
Oh, no fucking shit,
she'll freak.

2099
01:55:46,060 --> 01:55:48,060
That ain't no kind of answer.

2100
01:55:48,100 --> 01:55:49,380
I mean, you know, I don't.

2101
01:55:49,420 --> 01:55:51,140
How much?
A lot or a little?

2102
01:55:51,180 --> 01:55:54,260
You got to appreciate
what an explosive element...

2103
01:55:54,260 --> 01:55:55,860
this Bonnie situation is.

2104
01:55:55,900 --> 01:55:58,100
I mean, if she comes
home from a hard day's work...

2105
01:55:58,140 --> 01:55:59,500
and finds a bunch
of gangsters in her kitchen...

2106
01:55:59,540 --> 01:56:01,500
doing a bunch
of gangster shit...

2107
01:56:01,540 --> 01:56:04,820
there ain't no telling
what she's liable to do.

2108
01:56:06,660 --> 01:56:09,220
Yeah, I've grasped that, Jules.

2109
01:56:09,260 --> 01:56:11,140
All I'm doing
is contemplating the "ifs."

2110
01:56:11,180 --> 01:56:13,380
I don't want to hear about
no motherfucking "ifs."

2111
01:56:13,420 --> 01:56:14,820
All I want to hear
from your ass is...

2112
01:56:14,860 --> 01:56:17,500
"You ain't got no problem.
I'm on the motherfucker.

2113
01:56:17,540 --> 01:56:18,900
"Go back in there,
chill them niggers out...

2114
01:56:18,940 --> 01:56:21,900
"and wait for the cavalry,
which will be coming directly."

2115
01:56:21,940 --> 01:56:25,180
You ain't
got no problem, Jules.

2116
01:56:25,220 --> 01:56:27,220
I'm on the motherfucker.

2117
01:56:27,260 --> 01:56:29,740
Go back in there
and chill them niggers out...

2118
01:56:29,780 --> 01:56:32,060
and wait for The Wolf,
who should be coming directly.

2119
01:56:33,340 --> 01:56:34,460
You're sending The Wolf?

2120
01:56:34,500 --> 01:56:36,620
Oh, you feel better,
motherfucker?

2121
01:56:36,660 --> 01:56:41,940
Shit, negro,
that's all you had to say.

2122
01:56:41,980 --> 01:56:45,180
Is she the hysterical type?

2123
01:56:45,220 --> 01:56:47,140
When is she due?

2124
01:56:48,460 --> 01:56:50,260
Mm-hmm.

2125
01:56:50,300 --> 01:56:53,180
Give me the principals'
names again.

2126
01:56:55,060 --> 01:56:57,340
Jules.

2127
01:56:57,380 --> 01:56:58,420
Mm-hmm.

2128
01:56:58,460 --> 01:57:01,140
Vincent.

2129
01:57:04,860 --> 01:57:06,540
Jimmie.

2130
01:57:08,180 --> 01:57:09,980
Bonnie.

2131
01:57:10,020 --> 01:57:10,980
Mm-hmm.

2132
01:57:15,100 --> 01:57:16,300
It's thirty minutes away.

2133
01:57:16,340 --> 01:57:18,020
I'll be there in ten.

2134
01:57:34,420 --> 01:57:37,140
You're Jimmie, right?
This is your house?

2135
01:57:37,180 --> 01:57:38,100
Sure is.

2136
01:57:38,140 --> 01:57:40,740
I'm Winston Wolf.
I solve problems.

2137
01:57:40,780 --> 01:57:41,900
Good. We got one.

2138
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:43,340
So I heard. May I come in?

2139
01:57:43,380 --> 01:57:45,420
Yeah, please do.

2140
01:57:45,460 --> 01:57:47,420
You must be Jules...

2141
01:57:47,460 --> 01:57:49,180
which would make you Vincent.

2142
01:57:49,220 --> 01:57:51,100
Let's get down
to brass tacks, gentlemen.

2143
01:57:51,140 --> 01:57:52,420
If I was informed correctly...

2144
01:57:52,460 --> 01:57:53,380
the clock is ticking,
is that right, Jimmie?

2145
01:57:53,380 --> 01:57:55,260
100%

2146
01:57:55,260 --> 01:57:56,940
Your wife Bonnie...

2147
01:57:56,980 --> 01:57:58,700
comes home at 9:30 in the a.m.,
is that correct?

2148
01:57:58,740 --> 01:57:59,980
Uh-huh.

2149
01:58:00,020 --> 01:58:02,740
I was led to believe if she
comes home and finds us here...

2150
01:58:02,780 --> 01:58:04,460
she wouldn't appreciate it
none too much?

2151
01:58:04,500 --> 01:58:05,860
She wouldn't at that.

2152
01:58:05,900 --> 01:58:08,620
That gives us forty minutes
to get the fuck out of Dodge...

2153
01:58:08,660 --> 01:58:11,740
which, if you do what I say
when I say it, should be plenty.

2154
01:58:11,780 --> 01:58:14,020
Now, you got a corpse
in a car...

2155
01:58:14,060 --> 01:58:16,260
minus a head in a garage.
Take me to it.

2156
01:58:23,660 --> 01:58:25,900
- Jimmie?
- Uh-huh.

2157
01:58:25,940 --> 01:58:27,260
Do me a favor, will you?

2158
01:58:27,300 --> 01:58:28,500
I thought I smelled
some coffee back there.

2159
01:58:28,540 --> 01:58:30,740
Would you make me a cup?

2160
01:58:30,780 --> 01:58:32,340
Yeah, sure.

2161
01:58:34,140 --> 01:58:36,500
Oh, how do you take it?

2162
01:58:36,540 --> 01:58:39,380
Lots of cream,
lots of sugar.

2163
01:58:41,580 --> 01:58:42,980
About the car... is there
anything I need to know?

2164
01:58:43,020 --> 01:58:45,220
Does it stall, smoke,
make a lot of noise?

2165
01:58:45,260 --> 01:58:46,820
Is there gas in it?
Anything?

2166
01:58:46,860 --> 01:58:49,580
Aside from how it looks,
the car is cool.

2167
01:58:49,620 --> 01:58:51,460
Positive? Don't get me
out there on the road...

2168
01:58:51,500 --> 01:58:53,100
I find out
the brake lights don't work.

2169
01:58:53,180 --> 01:58:56,580
Man, far as I know,
the motherfucker's tiptop.

2170
01:58:56,620 --> 01:58:58,500
Good enough.

2171
01:58:58,540 --> 01:59:00,300
Let's go back to the kitchen.

2172
01:59:05,820 --> 01:59:06,900
Here you go, Mr. Wolf.

2173
01:59:06,940 --> 01:59:08,380
Thank you, Jimmie.

2174
01:59:13,420 --> 01:59:14,860
Mmm.

2175
01:59:16,020 --> 01:59:17,620
OK, first thing...

2176
01:59:17,660 --> 01:59:20,180
you two, take the body,
stick it in the trunk.

2177
01:59:20,220 --> 01:59:22,900
Now, Jimmie, this looks to be
a pretty domesticated house.

2178
01:59:22,940 --> 01:59:24,260
That would lead me to believe
that in the gar age...

2179
01:59:24,300 --> 01:59:26,540
or under the sink, you got
a bunch of cleaners and shit?

2180
01:59:26,580 --> 01:59:27,620
Yeah, Mr. Wolf.
Under the sink.

2181
01:59:27,660 --> 01:59:29,540
Good. What I need
you two fellas to do...

2182
01:59:29,580 --> 01:59:32,220
is take those cleaning products
and clean the inside of the car.

2183
01:59:32,260 --> 01:59:34,180
I'm talking fast, fast, fast.

2184
01:59:34,220 --> 01:59:35,580
Go in the back seat...

2185
01:59:35,580 --> 01:59:38,740
scoop up all those little
pieces of brain and skull.

2186
01:59:38,780 --> 01:59:40,740
Get it out of there.
Wipe down the upholstery.

2187
01:59:40,780 --> 01:59:42,980
Now, it don't need
to be spick-and-span.

2188
01:59:42,980 --> 01:59:45,940
You don't need to eat off it.
Just give it a good once over.

2189
01:59:46,020 --> 01:59:48,660
What you need to take care of
are the really messy parts.

2190
01:59:48,700 --> 01:59:50,100
The pools of blood
that have collected...

2191
01:59:50,140 --> 01:59:51,700
you got to soak that shit up.

2192
01:59:51,740 --> 01:59:54,780
Now, Jimmie, we need to r aid
your linen closet.

2193
01:59:54,820 --> 01:59:56,180
I need blankets.
I need comforters.

2194
01:59:56,220 --> 01:59:58,100
I need quilts.
I need bedspreads.

2195
01:59:58,180 --> 01:59:59,660
The thicker the better,
the darker the better.

2196
01:59:59,740 --> 02:00:01,580
No whites. Can't use 'em.

2197
02:00:01,620 --> 02:00:03,740
We need to camouflage
the interior of the car.

2198
02:00:03,780 --> 02:00:05,460
We're going to line
the front seat and back seat...

2199
02:00:05,460 --> 02:00:08,260
and the floorboards
with quilts and blankets.

2200
02:00:08,300 --> 02:00:10,900
So if a cop stops us and sticks
his big snout in the car...

2201
02:00:10,940 --> 02:00:12,460
the subterfuge won't last...

2202
02:00:12,500 --> 02:00:15,260
but at a glance, the car
will appear to be normal.

2203
02:00:15,300 --> 02:00:17,260
Jimmie, lead the way.
Boys, get to work.

2204
02:00:17,300 --> 02:00:20,340
"Please" would be nice.

2205
02:00:20,380 --> 02:00:21,300
Come again?

2206
02:00:21,340 --> 02:00:23,260
I said
a "please" would be nice.

2207
02:00:25,100 --> 02:00:27,260
Get it straight, buster.
I'm not here to say "please."

2208
02:00:27,300 --> 02:00:29,460
I'm here to tell you what to do.

2209
02:00:29,500 --> 02:00:32,260
And if self-preservation
is an instinct you possess...

2210
02:00:32,300 --> 02:00:35,580
you better fucking do it
and do it quick.

2211
02:00:35,580 --> 02:00:36,860
I'm here to help.

2212
02:00:36,900 --> 02:00:39,500
If my help is not appreciated,
lots of luck, gentlemen.

2213
02:00:39,540 --> 02:00:41,020
No, Mr. Wolf,
it ain't like that.

2214
02:00:41,020 --> 02:00:42,060
Your help is definitely
appreciated.

2215
02:00:42,100 --> 02:00:43,740
Mr. Wolf, listen.

2216
02:00:43,780 --> 02:00:46,100
I don't mean disrespect, OK?
I respect you.

2217
02:00:46,140 --> 02:00:48,420
I don't like people barking
orders at me, that's all.

2218
02:00:48,460 --> 02:00:51,220
If I'm curt with you,
it's because time is a factor.

2219
02:00:51,260 --> 02:00:53,100
I think fast, I talk fast...

2220
02:00:53,140 --> 02:00:56,100
and I need you guys to act fast
if you want out of this...

2221
02:00:56,140 --> 02:00:57,980
so pretty please
with sugar on top...

2222
02:00:57,980 --> 02:00:59,900
clean the fucking car.

2223
02:01:03,700 --> 02:01:05,220
Don't be looking at me
like that, all right?

2224
02:01:05,260 --> 02:01:07,620
I can feel your look.

2225
02:01:09,700 --> 02:01:12,020
It's a 1974 Chevy Nova.

2226
02:01:14,220 --> 02:01:15,700
Green.

2227
02:01:17,700 --> 02:01:20,580
Nothing except
for the mess inside.

2228
02:01:22,780 --> 02:01:24,860
Mmm, about twenty minutes.

2229
02:01:26,540 --> 02:01:28,420
Nobody who'll be missed.

2230
02:01:30,380 --> 02:01:33,740
You're a good man, Joe.
Thanks a bunch.

2231
02:01:33,780 --> 02:01:35,220
How we coming, Jimmie?

2232
02:01:35,260 --> 02:01:37,260
Pretty good.
I got it all here...

2233
02:01:37,300 --> 02:01:39,460
but, uh...

2234
02:01:39,500 --> 02:01:40,580
Mr. Wolf, you got to
understand something.

2235
02:01:40,620 --> 02:01:42,620
Winston, Jimmie, please.
Winston.

2236
02:01:42,660 --> 02:01:46,140
You got to understand
something now, Winston.

2237
02:01:46,180 --> 02:01:47,940
Uh, no, thank you.

2238
02:01:47,980 --> 02:01:51,100
This is our best linen here...

2239
02:01:51,140 --> 02:01:53,660
and it was a wedding present...

2240
02:01:53,700 --> 02:01:55,260
from my Uncle Conrad
and my Aunt Ginny...

2241
02:01:55,300 --> 02:01:56,620
and they're not with us anymore.

2242
02:01:56,660 --> 02:01:58,020
I really want
to help you guys out...

2243
02:01:58,060 --> 02:02:00,580
Let me ask you
a question, Jimmie...

2244
02:02:00,620 --> 02:02:01,540
if you don't mind.

2245
02:02:01,580 --> 02:02:04,980
No, please, go ahead.

2246
02:02:05,020 --> 02:02:08,260
Your Uncle Conrad
and Aunt Ginny...

2247
02:02:08,300 --> 02:02:10,500
were they millionaires?

2248
02:02:10,540 --> 02:02:12,180
No.

2249
02:02:12,220 --> 02:02:14,940
Well,
your Uncle Marsellus is...

2250
02:02:14,980 --> 02:02:18,260
and I'm positive
if Uncle Conrad and Aunt...

2251
02:02:18,260 --> 02:02:20,820
- Ginny.
- Ginny were here...

2252
02:02:20,860 --> 02:02:25,020
they would furnish you
with a whole bedroom set...

2253
02:02:25,060 --> 02:02:28,900
which your Uncle Marsellus
is more than happy to do.

2254
02:02:31,780 --> 02:02:33,060
I like oak myself.

2255
02:02:33,100 --> 02:02:36,580
That's what I have
in my bedroom.

2256
02:02:36,620 --> 02:02:39,660
How about you, Jimmie?

2257
02:02:39,700 --> 02:02:41,620
You an oak man?

2258
02:02:42,580 --> 02:02:44,020
Oak's nice.

2259
02:02:50,260 --> 02:02:51,540
Oh, man.

2260
02:02:51,580 --> 02:02:53,780
I will never forgive
your ass for this shit.

2261
02:02:53,820 --> 02:02:55,500
This is some fucked-up
repugnant shit.

2262
02:02:55,540 --> 02:02:57,260
Jules, did you ever hear
the philosophy...

2263
02:02:57,300 --> 02:02:59,100
that once a man admits
that he is wrong...

2264
02:02:59,140 --> 02:03:02,140
that he is immediately
forgiven for all wrongdoings?

2265
02:03:02,180 --> 02:03:04,300
Get the fuck out my face
with that shit.

2266
02:03:04,340 --> 02:03:06,260
The motherfucker said that shit
never had to pick up...

2267
02:03:06,300 --> 02:03:08,580
itty-bitty pieces of skull
on account of your dumb ass.

2268
02:03:08,620 --> 02:03:09,940
I got a threshold, Jules.

2269
02:03:09,940 --> 02:03:11,860
I got a threshold
for the abuse that I will take.

2270
02:03:11,900 --> 02:03:13,540
Right now, I'm a fucking
race car, all right?

2271
02:03:13,580 --> 02:03:14,780
And you got me in the red.

2272
02:03:14,820 --> 02:03:17,300
I'm just saying
that it's fucking dangerous...

2273
02:03:17,340 --> 02:03:19,260
to have a race car
in the fucking red, that's all.

2274
02:03:19,260 --> 02:03:21,100
- I could blow.
- Oh, you ready to blow?

2275
02:03:21,140 --> 02:03:22,620
Yeah, I'm ready to blow.

2276
02:03:22,660 --> 02:03:25,580
I'm a mushroom cloud-laying
motherfucker, motherfucker.

2277
02:03:25,620 --> 02:03:28,140
Every time my fingers touch
brain, I'm "Superfly TNT."

2278
02:03:28,180 --> 02:03:30,420
I'm "The Guns of the Navarone."

2279
02:03:30,460 --> 02:03:32,580
In fact, what the fuck
am I doing in the back?

2280
02:03:32,620 --> 02:03:34,980
You the motherfucker
who should be on brain detail.

2281
02:03:35,020 --> 02:03:36,900
We fucking switching.
I'm washing the windows...

2282
02:03:36,940 --> 02:03:38,580
and you picking up
this nigger's skull.

2283
02:03:48,300 --> 02:03:49,780
Fine job, gentlemen.

2284
02:03:51,220 --> 02:03:53,020
We may get out of this yet.

2285
02:03:53,020 --> 02:03:55,540
I can't believe
this is the same car.

2286
02:03:55,580 --> 02:03:59,100
Let's not start sucking
each other's dicks quite yet.

2287
02:03:59,140 --> 02:04:00,540
Phase one is complete...
clean the car...

2288
02:04:00,540 --> 02:04:02,300
which moves us right
along to phase two...

2289
02:04:02,340 --> 02:04:03,740
clean you two.

2290
02:04:05,940 --> 02:04:07,780
Strip.

2291
02:04:07,820 --> 02:04:09,260
All the way?

2292
02:04:09,300 --> 02:04:11,460
To your bare ass.

2293
02:04:11,500 --> 02:04:13,020
Quickly, gentlemen.

2294
02:04:13,100 --> 02:04:14,580
We got about fifteen minutes...

2295
02:04:14,580 --> 02:04:17,540
before Jimmie's better half
pulls into the driveway.

2296
02:04:17,580 --> 02:04:19,820
Damn. This morning air
is some chilly shit.

2297
02:04:19,860 --> 02:04:21,780
Are you sure this is
absolutely necessary?

2298
02:04:21,780 --> 02:04:23,180
You know what you two
look like?

2299
02:04:23,220 --> 02:04:24,700
What?

2300
02:04:24,740 --> 02:04:26,420
Like a couple of guys who just
blew off somebody's head.

2301
02:04:27,900 --> 02:04:30,820
Stripping off those bloody rags
is absolutely necessary.

2302
02:04:34,900 --> 02:04:36,820
Toss them in Jim's garbage bag.

2303
02:04:36,860 --> 02:04:38,340
Don't do nothing stupid...

2304
02:04:38,380 --> 02:04:40,540
like leaving this shit out front
for Otto the Garbageman...

2305
02:04:40,580 --> 02:04:41,500
you know what I'm saying?

2306
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,420
Don't worry.
We're taking it with us.

2307
02:04:43,460 --> 02:04:45,740
Jim, the soap.

2308
02:04:47,060 --> 02:04:48,980
- Vincent.
- OK, gentlemen...

2309
02:04:49,020 --> 02:04:51,420
you've both been
to County before I'm sure.

2310
02:04:51,460 --> 02:04:52,380
Here it comes.

2311
02:04:52,460 --> 02:04:54,900
Goddamn!
The water's fucking cold.

2312
02:04:54,940 --> 02:04:56,660
Better you
than me, gentlemen.

2313
02:04:56,700 --> 02:04:58,820
Ha ha ha!

2314
02:04:58,860 --> 02:05:00,380
Don't be afraid
of the soap.

2315
02:05:00,420 --> 02:05:01,340
Spread it around.

2316
02:05:01,340 --> 02:05:02,260
Get him up there
a little bit.

2317
02:05:02,300 --> 02:05:04,340
Vincent's hair.

2318
02:05:04,420 --> 02:05:06,100
Come on, do it,
God damn it! Do it!

2319
02:05:06,100 --> 02:05:08,100
Uh, uh...

2320
02:05:08,140 --> 02:05:09,580
Towel 'em.

2321
02:05:20,220 --> 02:05:23,180
They're dry enough.
Toss them their clothes.

2322
02:05:25,060 --> 02:05:26,220
Perfect.

2323
02:05:26,260 --> 02:05:29,700
Perfect. We couldn't
have planned this better.

2324
02:05:29,740 --> 02:05:31,980
You guys look like...

2325
02:05:32,020 --> 02:05:34,140
What do they look like, Jimmie?

2326
02:05:34,180 --> 02:05:35,140
Dorks.

2327
02:05:36,260 --> 02:05:37,340
They look like
a couple of dorks.

2328
02:05:38,420 --> 02:05:40,820
Ha ha ha. They're your clothes,
motherfucker.

2329
02:05:40,860 --> 02:05:41,980
Come on, gentlemen.

2330
02:05:42,020 --> 02:05:43,540
We're laughing our way
right into prison.

2331
02:05:43,580 --> 02:05:45,460
Don't make me beg.

2332
02:05:48,460 --> 02:05:51,700
OK, gentlemen, let's get
our rules of the road straight.

2333
02:05:51,740 --> 02:05:54,140
We're going to a place called
Monster Joe's Truck and Tow.

2334
02:05:54,180 --> 02:05:56,660
Now, Monster Joe
and his daughter Raquel...

2335
02:05:56,660 --> 02:05:58,060
are sympathetic to our dilemma.

2336
02:05:58,100 --> 02:06:00,140
The place is North Hollywood...

2337
02:06:00,180 --> 02:06:03,820
so a few twists and turns aside,
we'll be going up Hollywood Way.

2338
02:06:03,860 --> 02:06:07,140
Now, I'll drive the tainted car.
Jules, you ride with me.

2339
02:06:08,580 --> 02:06:10,340
Vincent, you follow in my Acura.

2340
02:06:10,380 --> 02:06:14,380
Now, if we come across the path
of any John Q. Laws...

2341
02:06:14,420 --> 02:06:16,180
nobody does a fucking thing
till I do something.

2342
02:06:16,220 --> 02:06:17,260
- Right.
- What did I say?

2343
02:06:18,420 --> 02:06:20,020
Don't do shit unless...

2344
02:06:20,060 --> 02:06:22,340
- Unless what?
- Unless you do it first.

2345
02:06:22,380 --> 02:06:24,700
Spoken like a true prodigy.

2346
02:06:24,700 --> 02:06:25,780
How about you, Lash LaRue?

2347
02:06:25,820 --> 02:06:28,220
Can you keep your spurs
from jingling and jangling?

2348
02:06:28,260 --> 02:06:29,700
Mr. Wolf, look,
the gun went off.

2349
02:06:29,740 --> 02:06:30,940
I don't why.

2350
02:06:30,980 --> 02:06:32,100
I'm cool. I promise you.

2351
02:06:32,140 --> 02:06:35,460
Fair enough. Now, I drive
real fucking fast, so keep up.

2352
02:06:35,500 --> 02:06:37,660
If I get my car back
any different than I gave it...

2353
02:06:37,700 --> 02:06:40,300
Monster Joe's going to be
disposing of two bodies.

2354
02:06:43,020 --> 02:06:45,620
Out of my way, Rex.

2355
02:06:47,180 --> 02:06:49,700
- We cool?
- Like it never happened.

2356
02:06:49,740 --> 02:06:50,700
All right.

2357
02:06:50,740 --> 02:06:53,260
Boys, this is Raquel.

2358
02:06:53,300 --> 02:06:56,100
Someday, all this will be hers.

2359
02:06:56,140 --> 02:06:58,540
Hi. So, what's with the outfits?

2360
02:06:58,580 --> 02:07:01,140
You guys going to
a volleyball game or something?

2361
02:07:03,220 --> 02:07:05,100
I'm taking my lady
out for breakfast.

2362
02:07:05,140 --> 02:07:07,020
Maybe I could drop you two off.
Where do you live?

2363
02:07:07,060 --> 02:07:08,420
- Redondo.
- Inglewood.

2364
02:07:08,460 --> 02:07:10,780
It's... it's your future.

2365
02:07:10,820 --> 02:07:14,620
I... I see a... a cab ride.

2366
02:07:14,660 --> 02:07:16,540
Move out of the sticks, fellas.

2367
02:07:16,580 --> 02:07:17,700
Say good night, Raquel.

2368
02:07:17,740 --> 02:07:18,940
Good night, Raquel.

2369
02:07:18,980 --> 02:07:20,380
I'll see you guys around.

2370
02:07:20,460 --> 02:07:21,660
Stay out of trouble,
you crazy kids.

2371
02:07:21,700 --> 02:07:23,940
Mr. Wolf,
I just want to tell you...

2372
02:07:23,980 --> 02:07:25,860
it was a real pleasure
watching you work.

2373
02:07:25,900 --> 02:07:29,820
Yeah, really, and thank you
very much, Mr. Wolf.

2374
02:07:29,860 --> 02:07:31,260
Call me Winston.

2375
02:07:32,860 --> 02:07:34,780
You see that, young lady?
Respect.

2376
02:07:35,820 --> 02:07:38,020
Respect for one's elders
shows character.

2377
02:07:38,060 --> 02:07:40,060
I have character.

2378
02:07:40,100 --> 02:07:41,740
Because you are a character...

2379
02:07:41,780 --> 02:07:43,660
doesn't mean
that you have character.

2380
02:07:51,460 --> 02:07:53,340
Want to share a cab?

2381
02:07:53,380 --> 02:07:54,700
I could go for some breakfast.

2382
02:07:54,740 --> 02:07:57,100
Feel like having breakfast
with me?

2383
02:07:57,140 --> 02:07:58,580
Cool.

2384
02:08:03,540 --> 02:08:06,420
I don't know why,
I thought he'd be European...

2385
02:08:06,460 --> 02:08:08,460
Yo, man, he's about as European
as English Bob.

2386
02:08:08,500 --> 02:08:09,820
I know that now, but...

2387
02:08:09,860 --> 02:08:11,780
- Was he cool or what?
- Thank you.

2388
02:08:11,820 --> 02:08:14,820
Totally fucking cool,
in control.

2389
02:08:14,860 --> 02:08:17,660
Didn't even really get pissed
when you were fucking with him.

2390
02:08:17,700 --> 02:08:19,260
I was amazed.

2391
02:08:20,260 --> 02:08:21,500
Want some bacon?

2392
02:08:21,540 --> 02:08:23,180
No, man. I don't eat pork.

2393
02:08:23,220 --> 02:08:24,140
Are you Jewish?

2394
02:08:24,180 --> 02:08:25,260
Naw, I ain't Jewish.

2395
02:08:25,300 --> 02:08:26,660
I just don't dig on swine,
that's all.

2396
02:08:26,700 --> 02:08:28,260
Why not?

2397
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:30,700
Pigs are filthy animals.
I don't eat filthy animals.

2398
02:08:30,740 --> 02:08:33,100
Yeah, but bacon tastes good.

2399
02:08:33,180 --> 02:08:34,420
Pork chops taste good.

2400
02:08:34,460 --> 02:08:36,540
Hey, a sewer rat
may taste like pumpkin pie...

2401
02:08:36,580 --> 02:08:37,780
but I'd never know...

2402
02:08:37,820 --> 02:08:40,420
'cause I wouldn't eat
the filthy motherfuckers.

2403
02:08:40,460 --> 02:08:42,260
Pigs sleep and root in shit.

2404
02:08:42,260 --> 02:08:43,500
That's a filthy animal.

2405
02:08:43,540 --> 02:08:44,980
I ain't eating nothing
that ain't got sense enough...

2406
02:08:44,980 --> 02:08:46,380
to disregard its own feces.

2407
02:08:46,420 --> 02:08:49,020
How about a dog?
A dog eats his own feces.

2408
02:08:49,060 --> 02:08:51,460
I don't eat dog, either.

2409
02:08:51,500 --> 02:08:54,740
But do you consider a dog
to be a filthy animal?

2410
02:08:54,780 --> 02:08:56,700
I wouldn't go so far
as to call a dog filthy...

2411
02:08:56,740 --> 02:08:58,820
but they're definitely dirty.

2412
02:08:58,860 --> 02:09:02,100
But a dog's got personality.
Personality goes a long way.

2413
02:09:02,100 --> 02:09:03,700
Ah, so by that rationale...

2414
02:09:03,740 --> 02:09:05,220
if a pig had
a better personality...

2415
02:09:05,260 --> 02:09:07,100
he would cease to be
a filthy animal.

2416
02:09:07,140 --> 02:09:08,220
Is that true?

2417
02:09:08,260 --> 02:09:10,540
We'd have to be talking about
one charming motherfucking pig.

2418
02:09:11,580 --> 02:09:12,780
He'd have to be ten times
more charming...

2419
02:09:12,820 --> 02:09:14,740
than Arnold on "Green Acres,"
you know what I'm saying?

2420
02:09:20,380 --> 02:09:22,220
Oh, man, that's good.

2421
02:09:22,260 --> 02:09:25,660
That's good, man.
You're starting to lighten up.

2422
02:09:25,700 --> 02:09:28,620
You been sitting there
all serious and shit.

2423
02:09:28,660 --> 02:09:30,060
Man, I've just been
sitting here thinking.

2424
02:09:30,100 --> 02:09:31,220
About what?

2425
02:09:31,260 --> 02:09:32,500
About the miracle we witnessed.

2426
02:09:32,540 --> 02:09:34,220
The miracle you witnessed.

2427
02:09:34,260 --> 02:09:35,740
I witnessed a freak occurrence.

2428
02:09:35,780 --> 02:09:37,100
What is a miracle, Vincent?

2429
02:09:39,180 --> 02:09:40,420
An act of God.

2430
02:09:40,460 --> 02:09:43,780
And what's an act of God?

2431
02:09:45,540 --> 02:09:47,260
When, um...

2432
02:09:47,300 --> 02:09:48,980
God makes the impossible
possible.

2433
02:09:49,980 --> 02:09:53,620
But this morning
I don't think qualifies.

2434
02:09:53,620 --> 02:09:54,540
Hey, Vincent...

2435
02:09:54,580 --> 02:09:56,700
Don't you see?
That shit don't matter.

2436
02:09:56,740 --> 02:09:58,180
You're judging this shit
the wrong way.

2437
02:09:58,220 --> 02:10:00,540
I mean, it could be
God stopped the bullets...

2438
02:10:00,580 --> 02:10:03,660
or he changed Coke to Pepsi,
he found my fucking car keys.

2439
02:10:03,700 --> 02:10:05,900
You don't judge shit like this
based on merit.

2440
02:10:05,940 --> 02:10:07,780
Now, whether or not
what we experienced...

2441
02:10:07,820 --> 02:10:10,220
was an "According to Hoyle"
miracle...

2442
02:10:10,260 --> 02:10:11,540
is insignificant...

2443
02:10:11,580 --> 02:10:15,660
but what is significant
is I felt the touch of God.

2444
02:10:15,700 --> 02:10:17,020
God got involved.

2445
02:10:17,020 --> 02:10:18,740
But why?

2446
02:10:18,780 --> 02:10:20,460
Well, that's what's
fucking with me.

2447
02:10:20,500 --> 02:10:22,940
I don't know why,
but I can't go back to sleep.

2448
02:10:22,980 --> 02:10:25,380
You're serious?

2449
02:10:25,420 --> 02:10:26,540
You're really thinking
about quitting?

2450
02:10:26,580 --> 02:10:28,220
- The life?
Yeah.

2451
02:10:28,260 --> 02:10:29,180
Most definitely.

2452
02:10:29,220 --> 02:10:30,500
Fuck.

2453
02:10:30,540 --> 02:10:32,460
What you going to do, then?

2454
02:10:33,820 --> 02:10:37,900
Well, that's what I've been
sitting here contemplating.

2455
02:10:37,940 --> 02:10:41,460
First, I'm going to deliver
this case to Marsellus.

2456
02:10:41,500 --> 02:10:44,340
Then, basically, I'm just
going to walk the earth.

2457
02:10:44,380 --> 02:10:45,780
What you mean, walk the earth?

2458
02:10:45,780 --> 02:10:47,940
You know,
like Caine in "Kung Fu."

2459
02:10:47,940 --> 02:10:50,620
Walk from place to place,
meet people, get in adventures.

2460
02:10:50,660 --> 02:10:52,860
And how long do you intend
to walk the earth?

2461
02:10:52,900 --> 02:10:54,940
Till God puts me
where he wants me to be.

2462
02:10:54,980 --> 02:10:56,100
And what if he don't do that?

2463
02:10:56,140 --> 02:10:58,460
If it takes forever,
then I'll walk forever.

2464
02:10:58,500 --> 02:11:00,900
So you decided to be a bum?

2465
02:11:00,940 --> 02:11:04,460
I'll just be Jules, Vincent...
no more, no less.

2466
02:11:04,500 --> 02:11:06,420
No, Jules.
You decided to be a bum...

2467
02:11:06,460 --> 02:11:08,460
Just like all those
pieces of shit out there...

2468
02:11:08,500 --> 02:11:09,860
who beg for change...

2469
02:11:09,900 --> 02:11:12,540
who sleep in garbage bins,
eat what I throw away.

2470
02:11:12,580 --> 02:11:14,140
They got a name
for that, Jules.

2471
02:11:14,140 --> 02:11:15,660
It's called a bum.

2472
02:11:15,700 --> 02:11:18,100
And without a job, a residence,
or legal tender...

2473
02:11:18,180 --> 02:11:19,340
that's what you're
going to be, man.

2474
02:11:19,380 --> 02:11:20,940
You're going
to be a fucking bum.

2475
02:11:20,980 --> 02:11:23,820
Look, my friend, this is just
where you and I differ.

2476
02:11:23,860 --> 02:11:25,460
Garcon!

2477
02:11:25,500 --> 02:11:26,620
Coffee!

2478
02:11:26,660 --> 02:11:30,380
What happened this morning,
man, I agree it was peculiar.

2479
02:11:30,420 --> 02:11:31,340
Garcon means boy.

2480
02:11:31,380 --> 02:11:32,700
But water into wine. I...

2481
02:11:32,740 --> 02:11:34,060
All shapes and sizes, Vincent.

2482
02:11:34,100 --> 02:11:36,060
Don't fucking talk to me
that way, man.

2483
02:11:36,140 --> 02:11:37,340
If my answers
frighten you, Vincent...

2484
02:11:37,380 --> 02:11:39,660
then you should cease
asking scary questions.

2485
02:11:42,820 --> 02:11:45,620
I'm going to take a shit.

2486
02:11:48,300 --> 02:11:49,500
Let me ask you something.

2487
02:11:49,540 --> 02:11:51,620
When did you
make this decision?

2488
02:11:51,620 --> 02:11:52,820
When you were sitting there
eating that muffin?

2489
02:11:52,860 --> 02:11:54,180
Well, yeah.

2490
02:11:54,220 --> 02:11:55,420
I was sitting here
eating my muffin...

2491
02:11:55,460 --> 02:11:56,660
and drinking my coffee...

2492
02:11:56,700 --> 02:11:58,420
and replaying
the incident in my head...

2493
02:11:58,460 --> 02:12:02,300
when I had what alcoholics
refer to as a moment of clarity.

2494
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,260
Fuck.

2495
02:12:04,300 --> 02:12:05,700
To be continued.

2496
02:12:16,860 --> 02:12:18,340
I love you, Pumpkin.

2497
02:12:18,380 --> 02:12:21,260
And I love you, Honey Bunny.

2498
02:12:21,300 --> 02:12:23,380
Everybody be cool!
This is a robbery!

2499
02:12:23,420 --> 02:12:25,860
Any of you
fucking pricks move...

2500
02:12:25,900 --> 02:12:29,180
and I'll execute every one
of you motherfuckers!

2501
02:12:29,180 --> 02:12:30,820
You got that?

2502
02:12:30,860 --> 02:12:32,260
You just be quiet!

2503
02:12:32,260 --> 02:12:35,260
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

2504
02:12:35,300 --> 02:12:37,180
You, you're in a blind spot.

2505
02:12:37,220 --> 02:12:39,860
Take your dames to that booth
on the count of ten.

2506
02:12:39,900 --> 02:12:41,340
Mexicans out
of the fucking kitchen!

2507
02:12:41,380 --> 02:12:44,300
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight!

2508
02:12:44,340 --> 02:12:45,580
Where the fuck are you going?

2509
02:12:45,620 --> 02:12:47,340
You fucking yuppie! Get down!

2510
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:49,740
Hey, you, throw those bags!

2511
02:12:49,820 --> 02:12:52,460
Fucking wanker! Move! Move!

2512
02:12:52,500 --> 02:12:54,460
What the fuck are you doing?
Move!

2513
02:12:54,500 --> 02:12:55,940
The restaurant's ours!

2514
02:12:55,980 --> 02:12:57,460
Move!
Get down on the fucking floor!

2515
02:12:57,500 --> 02:12:59,340
Grandpa, down!

2516
02:12:59,380 --> 02:13:00,820
I'm the manager here...

2517
02:13:00,860 --> 02:13:02,700
and there's no problem...
no problem at all.

2518
02:13:02,740 --> 02:13:04,060
You're going to give me
a problem?

2519
02:13:04,100 --> 02:13:05,380
No, sir, I'm not.

2520
02:13:05,420 --> 02:13:07,460
I thought you said you're going
to give me a fucking problem!

2521
02:13:07,500 --> 02:13:10,180
You're going to give me
a fucking problem?

2522
02:13:10,220 --> 02:13:12,100
I think we got a hero here,
Honey Bunny!

2523
02:13:12,140 --> 02:13:14,060
Well, just execute him!

2524
02:13:15,180 --> 02:13:17,580
I am not a hero.
I'm just a coffee shop...

2525
02:13:17,620 --> 02:13:18,940
Get the fuck down!

2526
02:13:18,980 --> 02:13:20,700
The restaurant's ours!

2527
02:13:20,740 --> 02:13:23,900
Just take whatever you want.

2528
02:13:23,940 --> 02:13:25,700
- You talk to the customers.
- Yeah.

2529
02:13:25,740 --> 02:13:27,540
You tell them
to be fucking cool...

2530
02:13:27,580 --> 02:13:28,940
- and everything will be over!
- Yeah.

2531
02:13:28,980 --> 02:13:30,460
- You understand me?
- Yes.

2532
02:13:32,860 --> 02:13:34,620
Listen, everybody.

2533
02:13:34,660 --> 02:13:35,940
Be calm...

2534
02:13:35,940 --> 02:13:37,220
cooperate...

2535
02:13:37,260 --> 02:13:39,740
and this will all be over
in a minute.

2536
02:13:39,780 --> 02:13:41,300
Get the fuck down!
Well done.

2537
02:13:53,140 --> 02:13:54,500
All right, now, people...

2538
02:13:54,540 --> 02:13:56,380
I'm going to come around
and collect your wallets.

2539
02:13:56,420 --> 02:13:57,740
You don't fucking talk.

2540
02:13:57,780 --> 02:13:59,980
You just throw them in the bag.
Are we clear?

2541
02:14:00,020 --> 02:14:02,180
I said, are we fucking clear?

2542
02:14:02,220 --> 02:14:04,100
Good. Now wallets out.

2543
02:14:05,900 --> 02:14:07,660
That's it.
Get the fuck down.

2544
02:14:07,700 --> 02:14:08,700
In the bag.

2545
02:14:08,740 --> 02:14:09,940
In the fucking bag!

2546
02:14:09,980 --> 02:14:12,980
I don't have
nothing on me, man.

2547
02:14:14,380 --> 02:14:16,060
What am I waiting for?
In the fucking bag.

2548
02:14:16,100 --> 02:14:18,540
Laura? Laura, tips.

2549
02:14:18,580 --> 02:14:19,980
- In the bag.
- Yeah.

2550
02:14:20,020 --> 02:14:21,700
- Is that a cellular phone?
- Yeah.

2551
02:14:21,740 --> 02:14:23,700
In the fucking bag.

2552
02:14:24,660 --> 02:14:26,100
Tidy up, tidy up.
That's it.

2553
02:14:26,140 --> 02:14:28,020
Now get the fuck
down on the floor.

2554
02:14:28,020 --> 02:14:31,100
In the bag.

2555
02:14:42,540 --> 02:14:43,900
In the bag.

2556
02:14:58,340 --> 02:14:59,620
What's in the case?

2557
02:14:59,660 --> 02:15:01,180
My boss's dirty laundry.

2558
02:15:01,220 --> 02:15:02,620
Your boss makes you
do his laundry?

2559
02:15:02,660 --> 02:15:03,580
When he wants it clean.

2560
02:15:03,620 --> 02:15:04,620
Sounds like a shit job.

2561
02:15:04,660 --> 02:15:06,340
Funny.
I was thinking the same thing.

2562
02:15:06,380 --> 02:15:07,340
Open it.

2563
02:15:07,380 --> 02:15:09,220
Afraid I can't do that.

2564
02:15:10,820 --> 02:15:12,060
I didn't hear you.

2565
02:15:12,060 --> 02:15:13,420
Yes, you did.

2566
02:15:14,540 --> 02:15:15,740
What's going on?

2567
02:15:15,780 --> 02:15:18,580
Looks like we got
a vigilante in our midst.

2568
02:15:18,580 --> 02:15:20,220
Shoot him in the face.

2569
02:15:20,260 --> 02:15:22,220
I hate to shatter your ego,
but this ain't the first time...

2570
02:15:22,300 --> 02:15:23,740
I've had a gun pointed at me.

2571
02:15:23,780 --> 02:15:26,100
You don't take your hand off
that case, it'll be your last.

2572
02:15:26,140 --> 02:15:28,220
Stop causing problems!
You'll get us all killed!

2573
02:15:28,260 --> 02:15:29,820
Give 'em what you got
and get 'em out of there!

2574
02:15:29,820 --> 02:15:31,100
Shut the fuck up, fat man!

2575
02:15:31,140 --> 02:15:32,340
This ain't none
of your goddamn business.

2576
02:15:34,300 --> 02:15:36,300
Be cool, Honey Bunny. Be cool.

2577
02:15:36,340 --> 02:15:38,260
It's no problem.
I got it under control.

2578
02:15:39,900 --> 02:15:41,700
Now I'm going to count to three.

2579
02:15:43,300 --> 02:15:44,940
If you don't open that case...

2580
02:15:44,980 --> 02:15:48,980
I'm going to unload
in your fucking face.

2581
02:15:51,180 --> 02:15:52,620
We clear?

2582
02:15:56,020 --> 02:15:56,980
One...

2583
02:16:00,620 --> 02:16:01,700
two...

2584
02:16:02,940 --> 02:16:04,140
- three.
- OK, Ringo.

2585
02:16:04,180 --> 02:16:06,420
You win.

2586
02:16:06,460 --> 02:16:07,900
It's yours.

2587
02:16:12,900 --> 02:16:14,660
Open it.

2588
02:16:18,260 --> 02:16:22,780
What is it?

2589
02:16:22,820 --> 02:16:25,340
Is that what I think it is?

2590
02:16:25,380 --> 02:16:27,020
Mm-hmm.

2591
02:16:29,780 --> 02:16:31,140
It's beautiful.

2592
02:16:31,180 --> 02:16:34,060
God damn it, what is it?

2593
02:16:35,700 --> 02:16:39,260
You let him go! You let him go!
Let go of him!

2594
02:16:39,300 --> 02:16:41,180
- Tell that bitch to be cool!
- I'm gonna kill you!

2595
02:16:41,220 --> 02:16:42,940
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2596
02:16:42,980 --> 02:16:44,420
- Say, "Bitch, be cool!"
- Be cool!

2597
02:16:44,500 --> 02:16:45,740
Tell that fuckin' bitch
to chill!

2598
02:16:45,780 --> 02:16:47,260
Be cool, Honey Bunny!

2599
02:16:47,300 --> 02:16:49,620
- Chill that fuckin' bitch out!
- Chill out, Honey Bunny!

2600
02:16:49,660 --> 02:16:51,380
- Let go of him!
Chill!

2601
02:16:51,420 --> 02:16:52,540
Tell her it's
going to be all right.

2602
02:16:52,580 --> 02:16:53,540
It's going to be all right.

2603
02:16:53,580 --> 02:16:54,860
- Promise her!
- I promise!

2604
02:16:54,900 --> 02:16:56,580
- Tell her to chill!
- Just chill out, Honey Bunny!

2605
02:16:56,620 --> 02:16:57,980
- Now tell me her name.
- Yolanda.

2606
02:16:58,020 --> 02:16:59,700
All right, now, Yolanda!

2607
02:16:59,740 --> 02:17:01,620
We're not gonna
do anything stupid, are we?

2608
02:17:01,660 --> 02:17:03,020
Don't you hurt him!

2609
02:17:03,060 --> 02:17:04,260
Nobody's gonna hurt anybody.

2610
02:17:04,300 --> 02:17:06,660
We're all gonna be like
three little Fonzies here.

2611
02:17:06,660 --> 02:17:08,500
And what's Fonzie like?

2612
02:17:08,540 --> 02:17:10,740
Come on, Yolanda,
what's Fonzie like?!

2613
02:17:10,780 --> 02:17:11,860
He's cool?

2614
02:17:11,900 --> 02:17:13,220
What?
- Cool.

2615
02:17:13,260 --> 02:17:14,580
Correctamundo!

2616
02:17:14,620 --> 02:17:17,980
And that's what we're gonna be.
We're gonna be cool.

2617
02:17:18,020 --> 02:17:22,820
Now, Ringo,
I'm gonna count to three.

2618
02:17:22,860 --> 02:17:24,740
And when I count three...

2619
02:17:24,780 --> 02:17:26,980
I want you to let go
of your gun...

2620
02:17:27,020 --> 02:17:29,460
put your palms
flat on the table...

2621
02:17:29,500 --> 02:17:32,020
and sit your ass down.

2622
02:17:32,060 --> 02:17:36,220
But when you do it,
you do it cool.

2623
02:17:36,260 --> 02:17:37,340
You ready?

2624
02:17:38,700 --> 02:17:40,660
One...

2625
02:17:40,700 --> 02:17:42,740
two...

2626
02:17:42,780 --> 02:17:44,020
three.

2627
02:17:51,260 --> 02:17:53,660
OK, now you let him go!

2628
02:17:53,700 --> 02:17:55,820
Yolanda, I thought
you were gonna be cool.

2629
02:17:55,860 --> 02:17:57,820
Now, when you yell at me,
it makes me nervous.

2630
02:17:57,860 --> 02:17:59,900
And when I get nervous,
I get scared.

2631
02:17:59,940 --> 02:18:01,740
And when motherfuckers
get scared...

2632
02:18:01,780 --> 02:18:05,300
that's when motherfuckers
accidentally get shot.

2633
02:18:05,300 --> 02:18:08,740
Just know,
you hurt him, you die.

2634
02:18:08,780 --> 02:18:12,220
Well, that seems
to be the situation.

2635
02:18:12,260 --> 02:18:15,860
But I don't want that,
and you don't want that...

2636
02:18:15,900 --> 02:18:18,700
and Ringo here definitely
doesn't want that.

2637
02:18:18,740 --> 02:18:20,660
So let's see what we can do.

2638
02:18:20,700 --> 02:18:22,900
Now...

2639
02:18:22,940 --> 02:18:26,500
here's the situation.

2640
02:18:26,540 --> 02:18:27,820
Normally both your asses...

2641
02:18:27,860 --> 02:18:29,780
would be dead
as fuckin' fried chicken...

2642
02:18:29,820 --> 02:18:31,020
but you happened
to pull this shit...

2643
02:18:31,060 --> 02:18:32,340
while I'm in
a transitional period...

2644
02:18:32,380 --> 02:18:35,100
and I don't want to kill you.
I want to help you.

2645
02:18:35,140 --> 02:18:39,620
But I can't give you this case,
'cause it don't belong to me.

2646
02:18:39,660 --> 02:18:42,780
Besides, I been through
too much shit over this case...

2647
02:18:42,820 --> 02:18:45,980
to just hand it over
to your dumb ass.

2648
02:18:46,020 --> 02:18:47,540
Vincent!

2649
02:18:47,580 --> 02:18:49,100
Be cool!

2650
02:18:49,140 --> 02:18:52,020
Yolanda, it's cool, baby!
It's cool!

2651
02:18:52,060 --> 02:18:53,180
We still just talking!

2652
02:18:53,220 --> 02:18:54,820
Come on, point the gun at me!

2653
02:18:54,860 --> 02:18:56,660
Point the gun at me!
There you go.

2654
02:18:56,700 --> 02:19:01,180
Now, Vincent, you just hang back
and don't do a goddamn thing.

2655
02:19:01,220 --> 02:19:03,820
Tell her we're still cool.

2656
02:19:03,860 --> 02:19:05,260
We're still cool, Honey Bunny.

2657
02:19:05,340 --> 02:19:07,260
How we doing, baby?

2658
02:19:07,300 --> 02:19:10,420
I... I gotta go pee.
I want to go home.

2659
02:19:10,460 --> 02:19:11,940
Just hang in there, baby.

2660
02:19:11,980 --> 02:19:13,460
You're doin' great.
I'm proud of you.

2661
02:19:13,500 --> 02:19:14,700
And Ringo's proud of you.

2662
02:19:14,740 --> 02:19:16,500
It's almost over.

2663
02:19:16,500 --> 02:19:18,380
Tell her you're proud of her.

2664
02:19:18,420 --> 02:19:19,660
I'm proud of you, Honey Bunny.

2665
02:19:19,700 --> 02:19:21,420
I love you.

2666
02:19:21,460 --> 02:19:23,060
I love you, too, Honey Bunny.

2667
02:19:23,100 --> 02:19:28,020
I want you to go in that bag
and find my wallet.

2668
02:19:30,500 --> 02:19:31,900
Which one is it?

2669
02:19:31,940 --> 02:19:34,180
It's the one that says
"Bad Motherfucker."

2670
02:19:48,260 --> 02:19:49,860
That's it.

2671
02:19:49,900 --> 02:19:51,260
That's my Bad Motherfucker.

2672
02:19:51,300 --> 02:19:53,780
Open it up. Take out the money.

2673
02:19:59,260 --> 02:20:00,700
Count it.

2674
02:20:06,860 --> 02:20:09,220
How much is there?

2675
02:20:11,420 --> 02:20:12,820
About $1,500.

2676
02:20:12,900 --> 02:20:15,980
OK, put it in your pocket.
It's yours.

2677
02:20:16,020 --> 02:20:18,860
With the rest of those wallets
and the register...

2678
02:20:18,860 --> 02:20:20,740
that makes this a pretty
successful little score.

2679
02:20:20,780 --> 02:20:23,260
Jules, you give
that fuckin' nimrod $1,500...

2680
02:20:23,300 --> 02:20:25,020
and I'll shoot him
on general principle.

2681
02:20:25,020 --> 02:20:26,100
No, Yolanda, Yolanda!

2682
02:20:26,140 --> 02:20:28,180
He ain't gonna do a goddamn
motherfuckin' thing.

2683
02:20:28,220 --> 02:20:29,820
Vince, shut the fuck up!

2684
02:20:29,860 --> 02:20:31,380
Shut up!

2685
02:20:31,420 --> 02:20:33,300
Come on, Yolanda,
stay with me, baby.

2686
02:20:33,300 --> 02:20:37,260
Now, I ain't givin' it to him,
Vincent.

2687
02:20:37,300 --> 02:20:39,020
I'm buyin' somethin'
for my money.

2688
02:20:39,060 --> 02:20:42,460
Wanna know what I'm buyin',
Ringo?

2689
02:20:42,500 --> 02:20:43,540
What?

2690
02:20:43,580 --> 02:20:44,660
Your life.

2691
02:20:44,700 --> 02:20:46,300
I'm givin' you that money...

2692
02:20:46,340 --> 02:20:49,060
so I don't have
to kill your ass.

2693
02:20:49,100 --> 02:20:51,820
You read the Bible, Ringo?

2694
02:20:51,860 --> 02:20:53,420
Not regularly, no.

2695
02:20:53,460 --> 02:20:55,780
Well, there's this passage
I got memorized.

2696
02:20:55,820 --> 02:20:59,380
"Ezekiel" 25:17.

2697
02:20:59,420 --> 02:21:02,380
"The path of the righteous man
is beset on all sides...

2698
02:21:02,420 --> 02:21:04,180
"by the inequities
of the selfish...

2699
02:21:04,180 --> 02:21:05,940
"and the tyranny of evil men.

2700
02:21:05,980 --> 02:21:09,380
"Blessed is he who in the name
of charity and good will...

2701
02:21:09,420 --> 02:21:11,660
"shepherds the weak through
the Valley of Darkness...

2702
02:21:11,700 --> 02:21:13,100
"for he is truly
his brother's keeper...

2703
02:21:13,140 --> 02:21:15,700
"and the finder
of lost children.

2704
02:21:15,740 --> 02:21:17,580
"And I will strike down
upon thee...

2705
02:21:17,620 --> 02:21:19,860
"with great vengeance
and furious anger...

2706
02:21:19,900 --> 02:21:22,820
"those who attempt to poison
and destroy My brothers.

2707
02:21:22,860 --> 02:21:25,740
"And you will know
I am the Lord...

2708
02:21:25,780 --> 02:21:29,260
"when I lay My vengeance
upon you."

2709
02:21:29,300 --> 02:21:32,460
Now, I been sayin'
that shit for years.

2710
02:21:32,500 --> 02:21:36,820
And if you heard it,
that meant your ass.

2711
02:21:36,860 --> 02:21:38,620
I never gave much thought
to what it meant.

2712
02:21:38,660 --> 02:21:40,220
I just thought
it was some cold-blooded shit...

2713
02:21:40,260 --> 02:21:43,700
to say to a motherfucker before
I popped a cap in his ass.

2714
02:21:43,780 --> 02:21:47,260
But I saw some shit this mornin'
made me think twice.

2715
02:21:47,300 --> 02:21:49,340
See, now I'm thinkin'...

2716
02:21:49,380 --> 02:21:52,940
maybe it means
you're the evil man...

2717
02:21:52,980 --> 02:21:54,860
and I'm the righteous man...

2718
02:21:54,900 --> 02:21:56,900
and Mr. Nine-millimeter here...

2719
02:21:56,940 --> 02:21:58,820
he's the shepherd
protecting my righteous ass...

2720
02:21:58,820 --> 02:22:01,300
in the Valley of Darkness.

2721
02:22:01,340 --> 02:22:03,220
Or it could mean...

2722
02:22:03,260 --> 02:22:06,340
you're the righteous man
and I'm the shepherd...

2723
02:22:06,380 --> 02:22:10,420
and it's the world
that's evil and selfish.

2724
02:22:10,460 --> 02:22:12,660
Now, I'd like that.

2725
02:22:12,700 --> 02:22:15,460
But that shit ain't the truth.

2726
02:22:15,500 --> 02:22:17,220
The truth is...

2727
02:22:18,500 --> 02:22:21,420
you're the weak...

2728
02:22:21,460 --> 02:22:24,780
and I am the tyranny
of evil men.

2729
02:22:24,820 --> 02:22:28,860
But I'm tryin', Ringo.

2730
02:22:28,900 --> 02:22:34,260
I'm tryin' real hard
to be the shepherd.

2731
02:22:49,020 --> 02:22:50,180
Go on.

2732
02:23:08,140 --> 02:23:10,740
I think we should
be leaving now.

2733
02:23:10,780 --> 02:23:12,700
Yeah,
that's probably a good idea.
