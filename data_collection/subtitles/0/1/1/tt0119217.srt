1
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,079
Mod f x square dx.

2
00:03:41,755 --> 00:03:45,004
So please finish Percival
by next time.

3
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:49,046
I know many of you had this as
undergraduates, but it won't hurt to brush up.

4
00:03:53,098 --> 00:03:55,007
Thank you, Steven.

5
00:03:56,517 --> 00:04:01,309
I also put an advanced Fourier system
on the main hallway chalkboard.

6
00:04:01,438 --> 00:04:04,107
And I'm hoping that one of you might
prove it by the end of the semester.

7
00:04:04,232 --> 00:04:06,983
Now, the person to do so
will not only be in my good graces...

8
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:10,359
but also go on to fame and fortune...

9
00:04:10,487 --> 00:04:13,239
by having their accomplishment
recorded and their name printed...

10
00:04:13,365 --> 00:04:16,282
in the auspicious M.I.T. Tech.

11
00:04:16,409 --> 00:04:20,276
Former winners include Nobel laureates,
Field's medal winners...

12
00:04:20,412 --> 00:04:25,038
renowned astrophysicists
and lowly M.I.T. Professors.

13
00:04:25,166 --> 00:04:26,625
Well, that's all.

14
00:04:26,751 --> 00:04:31,044
If you have any questions,
I'm sure that Tom has the answers.

15
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,578
- Hi, Will.
- Kirsten, how you doing?

16
00:05:10,705 --> 00:05:12,993
- I'm all right. How are you?
- Good.

17
00:05:13,124 --> 00:05:15,495
- I didn't get on Cathy last night.
- No?

18
00:05:15,626 --> 00:05:16,906
- No.
- Why not?

19
00:05:17,044 --> 00:05:19,961
- I don't know. Cathy!
- What?

20
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:23,456
Why didn't you give me none of that nasty
little hoochie-woochie you usually throw at me?

21
00:05:23,591 --> 00:05:27,339
Oh, fuck you and your Irish curse,
Chuckie.

22
00:05:27,469 --> 00:05:31,336
Like I'd waste my energy spreadin'
my legs for that Tootsie Roll dick?

23
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:34,805
- So go home and give it a tug yourself.
- Tootsie Roll!

24
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:36,843
Toot-Toots!

25
00:05:36,977 --> 00:05:40,061
She's missin' a tooth, Will.

26
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:43,189
She's got skin problems.
I don't...

27
00:05:43,316 --> 00:05:45,937
Plus, it's like 5-to-2, Morgan ends
up marryin' her, you know what I mean?

28
00:05:46,068 --> 00:05:49,104
There's only so many times you can bang
your friend's future wife.

29
00:05:49,237 --> 00:05:51,693
It's wrong.
Where you goin'?

30
00:05:51,823 --> 00:05:56,283
- I'm gonna take off.
- Fuck you, you're takin' off. It's like, what, 10:00?

31
00:05:56,410 --> 00:05:58,616
I'm tired.

32
00:06:00,956 --> 00:06:02,782
Irish curse?

33
00:06:02,916 --> 00:06:05,786
She don't know.
There ain't no Irish curse.

34
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,058
- Out!
- Stop brushing me back.

35
00:07:16,186 --> 00:07:20,349
Stop crowding the plate!
Which one will it be?

36
00:07:22,941 --> 00:07:24,601
You're gonna get charged,
you know that.

37
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:28,483
You think I'm afraid of you, you big
fuck? You're crowdin' the fuckin' plate.

38
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:33,239
Hey, uh, Casey's bouncin' up a bar, uh, at
Harvard next week. We should go up there.

39
00:07:33,367 --> 00:07:35,443
- What are we gonna do up there?
- I don't know.

40
00:07:35,577 --> 00:07:39,574
We'll fuck up some smart kids.
You'll probably fit right in.

41
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:44,120
Ow! Fuckin' punk!

42
00:07:45,002 --> 00:07:46,959
- Oh, what's up? You still tough?
- Come on!

43
00:07:47,879 --> 00:07:50,417
- You want this?
- Ah, come on, come on. That's it.

44
00:07:52,216 --> 00:07:57,210
I'd hold you forever here

45
00:07:57,345 --> 00:08:00,928
In my arms

46
00:08:01,057 --> 00:08:02,634
- Professor Lambeau?
- Yes?

47
00:08:02,767 --> 00:08:06,598
I'm in your applied theories class. We're
all up at the math and science building.

48
00:08:06,728 --> 00:08:10,512
Come here. It's Saturday!

49
00:08:10,648 --> 00:08:13,139
Unless you want to have a drink
with me tonight.

50
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:16,276
Maybe. We just couldn't wait
until Monday to find out.

51
00:08:16,403 --> 00:08:20,068
- Find out what?
- Who proved the theorem.

52
00:08:41,966 --> 00:08:45,916
This is correct.
Who did this?

53
00:08:46,053 --> 00:08:48,259
- Jack?
- It wasn't me.

54
00:08:49,139 --> 00:08:51,013
- Nemesh?
- No way.

55
00:08:55,144 --> 00:08:57,849
- Come on, Joey Mac!
- Billy, McNamara's up.

56
00:08:57,980 --> 00:09:00,352
Come on, kid!

57
00:09:00,482 --> 00:09:02,724
- Joey, dig it out of there. Dig it out!
- I love the pitch!

58
00:09:02,859 --> 00:09:06,274
Lay it down, Mac. That's how to do it!
Attaboy! Take two, Mac, take two!

59
00:09:07,613 --> 00:09:09,985
- Nice hit.
- Taylor, you're up.

60
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:13,815
Hey, Morgan, who's the girl with
the striped pants? She's got a nice ass.

61
00:09:13,952 --> 00:09:16,869
- Yeah, that's a real nice ass.
- Who's the guy she's with?

62
00:09:16,996 --> 00:09:20,447
Lt's that fuckin' guinea. I hate
that little bitch. Will knows him.

63
00:09:20,582 --> 00:09:22,954
- You know him?
- Yeah, fuckin' Carmine Scarpaglia.

64
00:09:23,084 --> 00:09:25,077
That kid used to beat the shit out of me
in kindergarten.

65
00:09:25,211 --> 00:09:26,954
- That guy?
- Yeah.

66
00:09:28,964 --> 00:09:31,004
Fuck this.
Let's get some food.

67
00:09:31,133 --> 00:09:33,256
Oh, what, Morgan,
you're not gonna go talk to her?

68
00:09:33,385 --> 00:09:34,713
Fuck her.

69
00:09:34,844 --> 00:09:37,465
- I could go for a Whopper.
- Let's go to Kelly's.

70
00:09:37,597 --> 00:09:40,597
Morgan, I'm not goin' to Kelly's
just 'cause you like the take-out girl.

71
00:09:40,724 --> 00:09:45,136
- It's 15 minutes out of our way.
- What the fuck are we gonna do? We can't spare 15 minutes?

72
00:09:47,897 --> 00:09:48,513
Double burger.

73
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:53,142
Double burger?

74
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,518
Chuck I had a double burger

75
00:09:56,654 --> 00:09:59,359
Would you shut the fuck up?
I know what you ordered. I was there.

76
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,491
- So give me my fuckin' sandwich.
- What do you mean, your sandwich? I bought it.

77
00:10:02,618 --> 00:10:04,326
Morgan, how much money you got on you?

78
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:08,366
I said I'd get change when I get the snow
cone. I said that before when we pulled up.

79
00:10:08,498 --> 00:10:10,704
Why don't you just gimme my sandwich
and stop bein' a prick?

80
00:10:10,833 --> 00:10:15,411
All right, well, give me your fuckin' 16 cents that you
got on you now. We'll put your fuckin' sandwich on layaway.

81
00:10:15,545 --> 00:10:19,412
Here we go. Keep it right up here
for ya. We'll put you on a programme.

82
00:10:19,549 --> 00:10:22,834
Every day you come in with your six cents.
At the end of the week, you get your sandwich.

83
00:10:22,968 --> 00:10:26,668
- Are you gonna be an asshole?
- What am I, fuckin' sandwich welfare?

84
00:10:26,805 --> 00:10:28,596
I think you should establish
a good line of credit.

85
00:10:28,723 --> 00:10:32,008
Like how you bought your couch:
Payment plans.

86
00:10:32,143 --> 00:10:34,894
Remember how your mother brought
in ten dollars every day for a year?

87
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:36,763
She finally got her couch
Rent-A-Center style.

88
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:40,182
- Can I have my food now, please?
- Here's your fuckin' double burger.

89
00:10:41,984 --> 00:10:44,356
- Whoa!
- Hey, hold up, Chuck.

90
00:10:44,487 --> 00:10:46,775
- Slow it down.
- Who do we got?

91
00:10:46,905 --> 00:10:49,478
- I don't know yet.
- Hey, douche bag!

92
00:10:49,616 --> 00:10:52,865
- Yeah, you, you skank face!
- Shut the fuck up!

93
00:10:52,994 --> 00:10:55,947
- Let's get outta here. - What are
you worried about? - Come on, Will.

94
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:57,739
Why don't you lick my love stick?

95
00:10:57,873 --> 00:11:01,288
We just seen the guy 15 minutes ago at the park.
If we was gonna fight him, we should fight him then.

96
00:11:01,417 --> 00:11:04,252
- We got snacks now.
- Shut up, Morgan, you're goin'.

97
00:11:04,378 --> 00:11:06,536
- I'm not goin'. - So
don't go. - I am not goin'!

98
00:11:06,672 --> 00:11:09,079
Fuckin' go, Morgan.

99
00:11:09,216 --> 00:11:13,544
Let me tell you somethin'. If you're not out there in
two fuckin' seconds, when I'm done with them, you're next.

100
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:17,722
Carmine, it's me. It's me, Will.
Remember? We went to kindergarten together.

101
00:11:17,848 --> 00:11:22,225
Way down the street
there's a light in his place

102
00:11:22,352 --> 00:11:24,889
He opens the door
He's got that look on his face

103
00:11:32,068 --> 00:11:35,484
- Fuckin', let's go, man!
- Step on his fuckin' head.

104
00:11:35,613 --> 00:11:39,562
Get his ass on the ground.
Stop that motherfucker.

105
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,908
Motherfucker, die!

106
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,578
- Carter!
- Come on!

107
00:12:02,636 --> 00:12:06,253
Will! Will, come on! Come on.

108
00:12:07,223 --> 00:12:09,761
Will, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

109
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:14,594
- Easy, brother, easy.
- Hey, fellas, thanks for comin' out.

110
00:12:14,729 --> 00:12:16,603
- Come here.
- Whoa, whoa!

111
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:25,439
Fuck!

112
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:37,038
Ls this just my imagination,
or has my class grown considerably?

113
00:12:38,416 --> 00:12:42,579
Well, by no stretch of my imagination do I
believe you've all come here to hear me lecture.

114
00:12:42,711 --> 00:12:47,705
Or rather, to ascertain the identity
of the mystery math magician.

115
00:12:47,841 --> 00:12:52,632
So without further adieu, come forward,
silent rogue, and receive thy prize.

116
00:13:03,812 --> 00:13:07,395
Well, I'm sorry to disappoint
my spectators, but...

117
00:13:07,524 --> 00:13:10,311
it seems there will be
no unmasking here today.

118
00:13:10,443 --> 00:13:14,061
However, um, my colleagues and I
have conferred...

119
00:13:14,196 --> 00:13:17,232
and there is a problem
on the board right now...

120
00:13:17,365 --> 00:13:19,488
that took us more than two years
to prove.

121
00:13:20,368 --> 00:13:24,151
So let this be said:
The gauntlet has been thrown down...

122
00:13:24,288 --> 00:13:28,332
but the faculty have answered
and answered with vigour.

123
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:43,044
- Hi.
- When's the arraignment?

124
00:13:43,179 --> 00:13:45,052
Next week.

125
00:14:12,162 --> 00:14:16,289
- Sorry. - What are
you doing? - Sorry.

126
00:14:16,415 --> 00:14:18,787
That's people's work.
You can't graffiti here.

127
00:14:18,917 --> 00:14:21,669
- Don't you walk away from me!
- Hey, fuck you!

128
00:14:21,795 --> 00:14:24,748
Oh, you're a clever one.
What's your name?

129
00:14:47,358 --> 00:14:49,101
Oh, my God.

130
00:14:55,949 --> 00:14:57,906
Looks right.

131
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:16,249
Will, how retarded do you gotta be
to get fired from that job?

132
00:15:16,383 --> 00:15:18,956
I mean, how hard is it to push
a motherfuckin' broom around the room?

133
00:15:19,093 --> 00:15:21,548
Mitch, you got fired from pushin'
a fuckin' broom.

134
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,422
I got fired 'cause management
was restructuring.

135
00:15:23,555 --> 00:15:26,509
Yeah, restructuring the amount
of retards they had workin' for 'em.

136
00:15:26,641 --> 00:15:28,717
Shut up. You get canned
more than tuna, bitch.

137
00:15:28,851 --> 00:15:32,220
- At least I got a motherfuckin' job right now, don't I?
- Yeah.

138
00:15:32,354 --> 00:15:36,897
- Why did you get fired, Will? Come on.
- Uh, management was restructuring.

139
00:15:38,234 --> 00:15:40,939
- My uncle could probably get you on a demo team.
- Can he do that?

140
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,316
- You kiddin' me? I asked you yesterday if I could get a job.
- And I told you "no" yesterday.

141
00:15:45,449 --> 00:15:47,986
- What's up, Case? - What's
up, Case? - What's up, Big Case?

142
00:15:50,745 --> 00:15:54,078
Let's sit over here.

143
00:16:00,503 --> 00:16:03,872
Oh, this is,
this is a Harvard bar, huh?

144
00:16:04,006 --> 00:16:06,544
I thought there'd be, like,
equations and shit on the walls.

145
00:16:08,426 --> 00:16:12,293
I will take a pitcher
of the finest lager in the house.

146
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:23,396
Time-out. I'm gonna have to bust a little move
on them Harvard hotties down there at the bar.

147
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:27,021
- Work some magic.
- Get some potion for us.

148
00:16:44,123 --> 00:16:45,498
- Oh, hello.
- Oh, hello.

149
00:16:45,625 --> 00:16:47,533
- Hi, how are ya?
- Fine.

150
00:16:47,668 --> 00:16:49,707
- So, do you ladies, uh...
- Come here often?

151
00:16:49,836 --> 00:16:54,830
Do I come here? I come here a bit. I'm
here, uh, uh, you know, from time to time.

152
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:57,207
- Do you go to school here?
- Yep.

153
00:16:57,343 --> 00:17:01,210
- Yeah. That's it. Yes, I think I had a class with you.
- Oh, yeah?

154
00:17:01,346 --> 00:17:03,671
- What class?
- History.

155
00:17:03,807 --> 00:17:06,724
- Maybe.
- Yes, I think that's what it was.

156
00:17:06,851 --> 00:17:10,350
You don't necessarily... May not
remember me. You know, I like it here.

157
00:17:10,479 --> 00:17:12,685
It doesn't mean 'cause I go here,
I'm a genius.

158
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,094
- I am very smart.
- Hey.

159
00:17:14,232 --> 00:17:16,438
- Hey! How's it goin'? How are ya?
- Good. How ya doin'?

160
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:19,105
- You wanna...
- What, uh... What class did you, did you say that was?

161
00:17:19,236 --> 00:17:21,110
- History.
- History. Yeah.

162
00:17:21,238 --> 00:17:24,737
Just history? Lt must've been
a survey course then, huh?

163
00:17:24,866 --> 00:17:26,408
- Yeah, it was. It was surveys.
- Right.

164
00:17:26,534 --> 00:17:29,203
You should check it out. It's
a good course. It'd be a good class.

165
00:17:29,328 --> 00:17:30,787
How'd you like that course?

166
00:17:30,913 --> 00:17:35,788
You know, frankly, I found the class,
you know, rather, uh, elementary.

167
00:17:35,917 --> 00:17:37,993
Elementary. You know,
I don't doubt that it was.

168
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:41,377
- Yeah.
- I, uh, I remember that class.

169
00:17:41,505 --> 00:17:45,253
It was, um, it was
just between recess and lunch.

170
00:17:45,383 --> 00:17:47,874
Clark, why don't you go away?

171
00:17:48,010 --> 00:17:50,086
- Why don't you relax?
- Why don't you go just away?

172
00:17:50,221 --> 00:17:52,094
I'm just having fun with my new friend.
That's all.

173
00:17:52,222 --> 00:17:55,176
- What, we gonna have a problem?
- No, no, no, no, no. There's no problem here.

174
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:59,222
I was just hoping you might give me
some insight into the evolution...

175
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,603
of the market economy
in the southern colonies.

176
00:18:02,731 --> 00:18:06,515
My contention is that, uh,
prior to the Revolutionary War...

177
00:18:06,651 --> 00:18:10,898
the economic modalities,
especially in the southern colonies...

178
00:18:11,030 --> 00:18:13,651
could most aptly be characterized as...

179
00:18:13,782 --> 00:18:15,573
- agrarian precapitalist.
- Let me tell you something. All right?

180
00:18:15,701 --> 00:18:17,942
Of course that's your contention.
You're a first-year grad student.

181
00:18:18,078 --> 00:18:21,244
You just got finished readin' some
Marxian historian, Pete Garrison, probably.

182
00:18:21,372 --> 00:18:24,242
You're gonna be convinced of that till
next month when you get to James Lemon.

183
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:27,624
Then you're gonna be talkin' about how the
economies of Virginia and Pennsylvania...

184
00:18:27,752 --> 00:18:30,539
were entrepreneurial and capitalist
way back in 1740.

185
00:18:30,671 --> 00:18:34,170
That's gonna last until next year. You're
gonna be in here regurgitatin' Gordon Wood...

186
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:37,300
talkin' about, you know,
the prerevolutionary utopia...

187
00:18:37,427 --> 00:18:41,720
and the capital-forming effects
of military mobilization.

188
00:18:41,848 --> 00:18:45,845
Well, as a matter of fact, I won't, because
Wood drastically underestimates the impact of...

189
00:18:45,976 --> 00:18:49,676
"Wood drastically, Wood drastically
underestimates the impact of social distinctions...

190
00:18:49,813 --> 00:18:52,849
predicated upon wealth,
especially inherited wealth"?

191
00:18:52,982 --> 00:18:57,145
You got that from Vickers'
Work in Essex County. Page 98, right?

192
00:18:57,277 --> 00:18:59,768
Yeah, I read that, too. Were you gonna
plagiarize the whole thing for us?

193
00:18:59,904 --> 00:19:03,569
Do you have any thoughts, uh,
of your own on this matter?

194
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:05,277
Or do you... Is that your thing?
You come into a bar.

195
00:19:05,409 --> 00:19:09,869
You read some obscure passage and then
pretend... You, You pawn it off as your own...

196
00:19:09,996 --> 00:19:14,741
As your own idea just to impress
some girls? Embarrass my friend?

197
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,493
See, the sad thing about a guy like you is, in 50 years
you're gonna start doin' some thinkin' on your own.

198
00:19:18,629 --> 00:19:21,000
And you're gonna come up with the fact
that there are two certainties in life.

199
00:19:21,131 --> 00:19:23,800
One: Don't do that.

200
00:19:23,925 --> 00:19:26,676
And two: You dropped 150 grand
on a fuckin' education...

201
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:29,968
you could've got for $1.50
in late charges at the public library.

202
00:19:32,223 --> 00:19:34,595
Yeah, but I will have a degree...

203
00:19:34,726 --> 00:19:38,639
and you'll be servin' my kids fries at a
drive through on our way to a skiing trip.

204
00:19:40,272 --> 00:19:43,189
Yeah, maybe. Yeah, but at least
I won't be unoriginal.

205
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:47,899
But I mean, if you have a problem with that, I mean,
we could just step outside. We could figure it out.

206
00:19:49,113 --> 00:19:53,276
No, man, there's no problem.
It's cool.

207
00:19:53,408 --> 00:19:55,649
- It's cool?
- Yeah. - Cool.

208
00:19:55,785 --> 00:19:58,192
- Fuckin' damn right, it's cool.
- How do you like me now?

209
00:20:01,999 --> 00:20:04,572
My boy's wicked smart.

210
00:20:06,127 --> 00:20:08,997
I just spent three minutes in this
fuckin' place, and run into a barney, huh?

211
00:20:10,297 --> 00:20:12,918
Well, there it is.
Hello, nice to meet ya.

212
00:20:13,050 --> 00:20:16,003
They were fine, man. I was gonna...
We was gonna close the deal...

213
00:20:16,135 --> 00:20:19,421
but then Chuck, uh,
Billy insulted one of 'em...

214
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:23,137
and the heavyset girl said that I even had a
receding hairline, and I was a few pounds overweight.

215
00:20:23,266 --> 00:20:25,508
And I was like, "Go fuck yourself. "

216
00:20:26,895 --> 00:20:29,017
I swallowed a bug.

217
00:20:30,314 --> 00:20:31,689
Hi.

218
00:20:31,815 --> 00:20:34,520
- You're an idiot.
- What?

219
00:20:34,651 --> 00:20:39,028
You're an idiot. I've been sitting over there for
45 minutes waiting for you to come and talk to me.

220
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:41,396
But I'm tired now,
and I have to go home.

221
00:20:41,532 --> 00:20:44,201
And I, I couldn't sit there any more
waiting for you.

222
00:20:44,326 --> 00:20:46,283
- Wh... I'm Will.
- Skylar.

223
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:48,035
- Skylar.
- Oh, and by the way...

224
00:20:48,162 --> 00:20:51,613
that guy over there,
Michael Bolton clone...

225
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,706
he wasn't sitting with us,
so to speak.

226
00:20:53,834 --> 00:20:55,707
Yeah, I know.
I kinda got that impression.

227
00:20:55,836 --> 00:20:59,002
Good. Okay.
Well, I've got to go.

228
00:20:59,130 --> 00:21:03,079
Gotta get up early and waste some
more money on my overpriced education.

229
00:21:03,217 --> 00:21:05,754
- No, I didn't mean you. I...
- Ah, that's all right.

230
00:21:05,886 --> 00:21:09,171
There's my number. So maybe we can
go out for coffee sometime.

231
00:21:09,305 --> 00:21:13,349
All right, yeah. May-Maybe we can just
get together and eat a bunch of caramels.

232
00:21:13,476 --> 00:21:17,223
- What do you mean?
- When you think about it, it's as arbitrary as drinkin' coffee.

233
00:21:17,354 --> 00:21:19,975
Oh. Yeah. Okay.

234
00:21:20,106 --> 00:21:23,107
- Uh, right, then.
- Come on.

235
00:21:30,198 --> 00:21:33,033
- Yo! - Fuck you, bitch!
- Hey, fuck you the same.

236
00:21:33,159 --> 00:21:36,741
- There goes them fuckin' barneys right now with their skiin' trip.
- Hold up. Hold up.

237
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:40,036
I should've beat that old bitch's ass.

238
00:21:46,670 --> 00:21:48,579
Do you like apples?

239
00:21:50,006 --> 00:21:52,082
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

240
00:21:53,676 --> 00:21:57,009
Well, I got her number!
How do you like them apples?

241
00:22:01,224 --> 00:22:06,099
We arrived tonight

242
00:22:06,228 --> 00:22:10,936
The miles were over me

243
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:17,809
I turned off the light

244
00:22:18,906 --> 00:22:22,819
So, come on, night

245
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,912
Everyone is gone

246
00:22:32,501 --> 00:22:35,703
Home to oblivion

247
00:22:37,129 --> 00:22:42,965
So come on

248
00:22:43,093 --> 00:22:47,304
So come on by

249
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:51,013
Tom.

250
00:22:55,270 --> 00:22:59,137
Excuse me. Is this the Buildings
and Grounds office?

251
00:22:59,273 --> 00:23:01,479
Yeah. What can I do for you?

252
00:23:01,608 --> 00:23:03,565
I just need the name of a student
who works here.

253
00:23:03,694 --> 00:23:06,065
- No students work for me.
- Well, could you please check?

254
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:08,318
I have this guy who works
in my building. He's about this high.

255
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:11,116
- Which one is your building?
- Two.

256
00:23:11,242 --> 00:23:13,400
Two. Building two.

257
00:23:19,665 --> 00:23:21,990
- Look, if anything was stolen, I should know about it.
- No, no, no. It's nothing like that.

258
00:23:22,126 --> 00:23:24,035
I just need his name.

259
00:23:24,169 --> 00:23:27,039
I can't give you his name
unless you have a complaint.

260
00:23:27,172 --> 00:23:30,338
- This is Professor Lambeau.
- And this is Professor Hayes.

261
00:23:30,466 --> 00:23:33,039
Tom, please.

262
00:23:35,053 --> 00:23:38,303
This is important. Please.

263
00:23:38,431 --> 00:23:42,345
Willy didn't show up for work today.

264
00:23:42,476 --> 00:23:44,552
Got this job through his P.O.
You can call him.

265
00:23:44,686 --> 00:23:48,684
- P.O.?
- Yeah. Parole officer.

266
00:23:52,568 --> 00:23:54,442
Thank you.

267
00:23:55,737 --> 00:23:57,611
Asshole.

268
00:23:59,991 --> 00:24:05,032
There is a lengthy legal precedent,
Your Honour, going back to 1789...

269
00:24:05,162 --> 00:24:08,412
whereby a defendant can claim self-defense
against an agent of the government...

270
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:12,833
if that act is deemed a defence against
tyranny, a defence of liberty.

271
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:17,289
Your Honour, Henry Ward Beecher, in Proverbs from
the Plymouth Pulpit, 1887, said, and I quote...

272
00:24:17,422 --> 00:24:19,794
- 1887? This is the 20th century, Your Honour.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

273
00:24:19,924 --> 00:24:21,668
- He's gonna make a mockery of the courtroom.
- I am afforded the right...

274
00:24:21,801 --> 00:24:25,845
to speak in my own defence, sir, by
the Constitution of the United States.

275
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:28,806
- This is the same document which guarantees my liberty.
- Don't tell me about the Constitution of the United States.

276
00:24:28,932 --> 00:24:31,387
And liberty, in case you've forgotten,
is a souI's right to breathe.

277
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,973
And when it cannot take a long breath,
laws are girded too tight.

278
00:24:34,103 --> 00:24:36,391
- Without liberty, man is a syncope.
- Man is a what?

279
00:24:36,522 --> 00:24:39,606
- Ibid., Your Honour.
- Son, my turn.

280
00:24:39,733 --> 00:24:44,394
I've been sitting here for ten minutes
now lookin' over this rap sheet of yours.

281
00:24:44,529 --> 00:24:48,395
I just can't believe it.
June '93, assault.

282
00:24:48,532 --> 00:24:50,608
September '93, assault.

283
00:24:50,742 --> 00:24:54,241
Grand theft auto, February of '94.

284
00:24:54,370 --> 00:24:58,581
Where, apparently, you defended yourself
and had the case thrown out by citing...

285
00:24:58,707 --> 00:25:03,036
"free property rights of horse
and carriage" from 1798.

286
00:25:03,169 --> 00:25:06,502
Joke. January '95,
impersonating an officer.

287
00:25:06,631 --> 00:25:10,580
Mayhem, theft, resisting.
All overturned.

288
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:14,300
I'm also aware that you've
been through several foster homes.

289
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:18,592
The state removed you from three
because of serious physical abuse.

290
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:22,852
You know, another judge might care,
but you hit a cop. You're going in.

291
00:25:22,978 --> 00:25:27,271
Motion to dismiss is denied.
$50,000 bail.

292
00:25:27,398 --> 00:25:29,936
- Thank you.
- Court, rise.

293
00:25:32,444 --> 00:25:34,602
- Hello?
- Uh, Skylar?

294
00:25:34,738 --> 00:25:36,896
- Yep.
- Hey, uh, it's Will.

295
00:25:37,031 --> 00:25:38,609
- Who?
- It's Will.

296
00:25:38,741 --> 00:25:41,777
You know, the really funny, good-looking
guy you met at the bar the other night.

297
00:25:41,910 --> 00:25:45,445
I don't recall meeting anyone who matched
that description. I think I'd remember.

298
00:25:45,580 --> 00:25:48,746
Oh, all right, you got me. It's
the ugly, obnoxious, toothless loser...

299
00:25:48,875 --> 00:25:50,997
who got hammered
and wouldn't leave you alone all night.

300
00:25:51,126 --> 00:25:55,170
Oh, Will! I remember.

301
00:25:55,297 --> 00:25:58,546
- How are you? I-I was wondering
if you'd call me. - Yeah, look.

302
00:25:58,674 --> 00:26:00,382
- I was wondering...
- Yo, so, baby. What's up?

303
00:26:00,509 --> 00:26:02,169
- Hold on one second.
- What you doing?

304
00:26:02,303 --> 00:26:04,710
- Hey!
- What's up, baby? Want some of my ass?

305
00:26:04,846 --> 00:26:08,464
- Herve! I remember you from juvi. How you doing?
- What's up, baby? What you doing?

306
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,806
Ah, yeah, sorry about that. Um...

307
00:26:10,935 --> 00:26:13,639
I was wonderin' maybe we could
get together, um, sometime this week.

308
00:26:13,771 --> 00:26:16,095
You know, sit out at a cafe.
Maybe have some caramels.

309
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,519
- Oh, that sounds wonderful.
- Yeah?

310
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:20,523
Yeah. Sure. Where are you?

311
00:26:20,651 --> 00:26:23,438
Um, well, actually, this is, uh,
this is just a shot in the dark...

312
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:27,899
but, uh, there's no chance that you're,
uh, pre-law, is there?

313
00:26:32,036 --> 00:26:35,155
- Have a seat.
- Thank you.

314
00:26:35,289 --> 00:26:37,198
Nice talking to ya.

315
00:26:39,626 --> 00:26:41,784
What the fuck do you want?

316
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,544
I'm Gerald Lambeau.

317
00:26:44,838 --> 00:26:47,329
The professor you told
to fuck himself.

318
00:26:48,592 --> 00:26:51,841
Well, what the fuck do you want?

319
00:26:51,969 --> 00:26:56,049
I've spoken to the judge, and he's agreed
to release you under my supervision.

320
00:26:56,890 --> 00:26:59,215
- Really?
- Yeah.

321
00:27:03,854 --> 00:27:06,345
- But under two conditions.
- What are those?

322
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:08,972
First condition is that
you meet with me every week.

323
00:27:09,109 --> 00:27:12,643
- What for?
- Go over the proof you're working on...

324
00:27:12,779 --> 00:27:17,356
get into some, some more advanced...

325
00:27:17,491 --> 00:27:20,527
combinatorial mathematics...

326
00:27:20,660 --> 00:27:22,534
finite math.

327
00:27:24,664 --> 00:27:26,537
Sounds like a real hoot.

328
00:27:28,125 --> 00:27:32,620
And the second condition is that,
that you see a therapist.

329
00:27:37,508 --> 00:27:40,793
And I'm responsible to submit reports
on those meetings.

330
00:27:40,927 --> 00:27:43,928
And if you fail to meet with any
of those conditions...

331
00:27:44,055 --> 00:27:45,928
you will have to serve time.

332
00:27:46,057 --> 00:27:50,433
All right. I'll do the math, but I'm not
gonna meet with any fuckin' therapist.

333
00:27:50,561 --> 00:27:54,392
It's better than spending that time
in jail, isn't it?

334
00:28:58,159 --> 00:29:02,239
I read your book, and, uh, and, and
"Mike" was havin' the same problems...

335
00:29:02,371 --> 00:29:04,660
that "Chad," the stockbroker,
was havin'.

336
00:29:04,790 --> 00:29:07,743
Absolutely right. Right on the button.
Good for you, Will. Very nice.

337
00:29:07,876 --> 00:29:09,453
Thank you.

338
00:29:09,586 --> 00:29:12,788
Will, the pressures,
and I'm not judging them...

339
00:29:12,922 --> 00:29:15,591
I'm not, uh, labelling them...

340
00:29:15,716 --> 00:29:18,669
but they are destroying
your potential.

341
00:29:18,802 --> 00:29:23,795
Now no more shenanigans.
No more tomfoolery. No more ballyhoo.

342
00:29:23,931 --> 00:29:26,718
You're right.

343
00:29:26,850 --> 00:29:28,724
God, I know.

344
00:29:29,936 --> 00:29:32,640
You know, you're not gonna get off
that easily. Come on, Will, a bit more.

345
00:29:32,772 --> 00:29:34,479
Well, I mean, I do, I do do things,
you know? I mean...

346
00:29:34,607 --> 00:29:37,062
What, uh, what kind of things?

347
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,395
I do things that, you know, I, uh... You
know, I mean, I hide from, from people.

348
00:29:40,528 --> 00:29:45,320
- You hide, do you?
- No, no. I mean, I like... I, I go places. I interact, you know.

349
00:29:45,449 --> 00:29:47,987
- Really? What sort of places?
- Just certain clubs.

350
00:29:48,118 --> 00:29:50,157
More. That's nice, yes.
What sort of clubs?

351
00:29:50,287 --> 00:29:53,287
- Like, um, like Fantasy.
- Fantasy?

352
00:29:53,414 --> 00:29:55,288
- It's not bad.
- Bit more.

353
00:29:55,416 --> 00:29:59,828
It's just something like when you get
in there and, the music like owns you.

354
00:29:59,961 --> 00:30:02,499
It's like that house music.
It's like...

355
00:30:05,508 --> 00:30:10,335
- You know, you start dancin'. It's just...
- Boom, boom, boom. Yes.

356
00:30:11,429 --> 00:30:14,346
- Yes.
- Yeah.

357
00:30:15,808 --> 00:30:18,263
Do you find it hard to hide the fact
that you're gay?

358
00:30:18,394 --> 00:30:21,347
What are you... What are you...
What are you talking about? What?

359
00:30:21,480 --> 00:30:24,017
Look, buddy, two seconds ago,
you were ready to give me a jump.

360
00:30:24,148 --> 00:30:27,351
A jump? Are you...

361
00:30:27,485 --> 00:30:29,643
I'm terribly sorry to disappoint you.
But...

362
00:30:29,778 --> 00:30:32,483
I don't have a problem with it.
I don't care if you putt from the rough.

363
00:30:32,614 --> 00:30:36,397
What are you... P-Putting from the rough?
What on earth are you talking about?

364
00:30:36,534 --> 00:30:41,740
A difficult theorem
can be like a symphony.

365
00:30:41,872 --> 00:30:43,911
It's very erotic.

366
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:46,709
You go somewhere else.
I can't handle this.

367
00:30:46,834 --> 00:30:50,037
- Wow.
- Thank you, Henry.

368
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,629
Ah, Henry.

369
00:30:51,755 --> 00:30:55,040
Hi, Gerry. Hey, you know something?
I can't do this pro bono work any more.

370
00:30:55,175 --> 00:30:57,048
It's just not... It's not worth it.

371
00:30:57,176 --> 00:30:59,749
- What happened?
- Well, I'm going on national television next week.

372
00:30:59,887 --> 00:31:03,718
I mean, I haven't got time to tell you,
much less talk to that raving loony in there.

373
00:31:03,849 --> 00:31:06,553
An absolute lunatic, he is.

374
00:31:06,684 --> 00:31:08,760
Henry.

375
00:31:08,895 --> 00:31:11,895
Okay, you are in your bed, Will.

376
00:31:12,022 --> 00:31:15,722
Now, how old are you?

377
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,733
Seven.

378
00:31:18,861 --> 00:31:21,352
What do you see?

379
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:24,898
Something's in my room.

380
00:31:25,033 --> 00:31:27,987
What is it?

381
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,864
Lt's like a, uh... It's a figure.
It's, it's hoverin' over me.

382
00:31:32,998 --> 00:31:36,532
You are in a safe place, Will.

383
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:40,250
It's t... It's touching me.

384
00:31:40,379 --> 00:31:42,952
Where is it touching you?

385
00:31:43,090 --> 00:31:45,841
Lt's touching me down there.

386
00:31:47,219 --> 00:31:49,425
And, uh, I'm nervous.

387
00:31:49,554 --> 00:31:53,254
You don't have to be nervous, Will.

388
00:31:53,390 --> 00:31:57,222
We start dancin' and dancin'.

389
00:31:57,352 --> 00:32:01,219
It's just beautiful,
'cause we can make...

390
00:32:01,355 --> 00:32:05,768
A lot of love before the sun goes down

391
00:32:06,943 --> 00:32:10,691
Skyrockets in flight

392
00:32:10,822 --> 00:32:13,491
Afternoon delight

393
00:32:13,616 --> 00:32:17,198
- Hey, hey afternoon delight
- Jesus.

394
00:32:17,327 --> 00:32:20,612
Skyrockets in flight

395
00:32:20,747 --> 00:32:24,162
- I'm sorry, Rich.
- I have better things to do with my time.

396
00:32:24,291 --> 00:32:27,292
Hey, hey afternoon delight

397
00:32:27,419 --> 00:32:31,037
Come on, one dance! You, you really
hypnotized me, you know.

398
00:32:31,172 --> 00:32:33,165
- For God's sake, Will.
- What? Oh, come on.

399
00:32:33,299 --> 00:32:35,291
I... He left.
You can't pin that on me.

400
00:32:35,426 --> 00:32:38,047
I told you to cooperate
with these people.

401
00:32:38,178 --> 00:32:41,013
- Look into my eyes.
- Get out, Will.

402
00:32:41,139 --> 00:32:45,634
- I don't need therapy.
- That's enough! Get out!

403
00:32:47,144 --> 00:32:49,018
I called Mel Weintraub this morning
to see...

404
00:32:49,146 --> 00:32:51,636
Oh, what's the use?

405
00:32:51,773 --> 00:32:53,931
What do you want to do?

406
00:32:58,195 --> 00:33:00,353
- Well, there is someone.
- Who is he?

407
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:03,573
He used to be my, um...

408
00:33:03,700 --> 00:33:05,988
my roommate in college.

409
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:13,244
Trust. Very important
in a relationship.

410
00:33:13,375 --> 00:33:15,533
It's also very important
in a clinical situation.

411
00:33:15,668 --> 00:33:18,337
Why is trust
the most important thing...

412
00:33:18,462 --> 00:33:20,834
in making a breakthrough
with a client?

413
00:33:23,341 --> 00:33:27,552
Maureen, stop the oral fixation
for a moment and join us.

414
00:33:27,678 --> 00:33:29,552
Vinnie?

415
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:34,092
Um, because, uh...

416
00:33:34,225 --> 00:33:37,345
Trust is, uh... Trust is life.

417
00:33:37,478 --> 00:33:41,060
Wow. That's very deep.
Thank you, Vinnie.

418
00:33:41,190 --> 00:33:42,648
Next time, get the notes
from your brother.

419
00:33:42,774 --> 00:33:47,317
You know, if a patient doesn't feel safe enough
to trust you, then he won't be honest with you.

420
00:33:47,445 --> 00:33:49,402
Then there's really no point for them
being in therapy.

421
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:52,530
I mean, hey, if they don't trust you, you know,
you're never gonna get them to sleep with you.

422
00:33:52,658 --> 00:33:54,531
And that should be the goal
of any good therapist.

423
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:56,735
Nail them while they're vulnerable.
That's my motto.

424
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:01,157
Oh, good, everyone's back.
Welcome back, everybody.

425
00:34:02,624 --> 00:34:06,324
- Hello, Sean.
- Hey, Gerry.

426
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:13,213
Um, ladies and gentlemen,
we are in the presence of greatness.

427
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:17,588
Professor Gerald Lambeau, Field's medal
winner for combinatorial mathematics.

428
00:34:17,721 --> 00:34:20,507
- Hello.
- Anyone know what the Field's medal is?

429
00:34:20,640 --> 00:34:23,391
Lt's a really big deal.
It's like the Nobel prize for math.

430
00:34:23,517 --> 00:34:27,016
Except they only give it out
once every four years.

431
00:34:27,145 --> 00:34:30,062
It's, it's a great thing.
It's an amazing honour.

432
00:34:30,189 --> 00:34:32,182
Okay, everybody, that's it for today.
Thanks. Um...

433
00:34:32,316 --> 00:34:35,103
We'll see you Monday.
We'll be talking about Freud.

434
00:34:35,235 --> 00:34:39,067
Why he did enough cocaine
to kill a small horse. Thank you.

435
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:41,947
How are you?

436
00:34:42,074 --> 00:34:44,612
- It's good to see you.
- Good to see you.

437
00:34:44,743 --> 00:34:45,941
- Sean?
- Yeah?

438
00:34:46,078 --> 00:34:48,829
I think I got
something interesting for ya?

439
00:34:48,955 --> 00:34:51,410
What? You have to have blood and urine?
What's up?

440
00:34:51,541 --> 00:34:57,127
- Why didn't you come to the reunion?
- Time. You know, I'm... I've been busy.

441
00:34:57,254 --> 00:34:59,211
- You were missed.
- Really?

442
00:34:59,339 --> 00:35:02,458
So, how long has it been
since we've seen each other?

443
00:35:02,592 --> 00:35:05,925
- Before Nancy died.
- Yeah. I'm sorry.

444
00:35:06,053 --> 00:35:08,460
I was in Paris.
It was that damn conference.

445
00:35:08,597 --> 00:35:10,304
I got your card.
It was nice.

446
00:35:15,769 --> 00:35:17,477
- Come here.
- Now, that's a good takedown.

447
00:35:17,604 --> 00:35:21,471
Hey, uh, what happened?
Did you, uh, get leniency or what?

448
00:35:21,608 --> 00:35:26,399
I got, uh, probation and then, uh,
counselling two days a week.

449
00:35:26,529 --> 00:35:29,979
Joke. You're a smoothie.
Come on, Morgan! Just submit!

450
00:35:31,449 --> 00:35:34,320
Hey, Bill, just, just get off him.
We're gonna miss the game.

451
00:35:34,452 --> 00:35:36,409
- I've got a full schedule.
- Sean, Sean. - I'm very busy.

452
00:35:36,537 --> 00:35:39,491
This, this boy is incredible.
I've never seen anything like him.

453
00:35:39,623 --> 00:35:42,707
What makes him so incredible, Gerry?

454
00:35:42,834 --> 00:35:47,080
- Ever heard of Ramanujan?
- Yeah, yeah. No.

455
00:35:47,213 --> 00:35:51,838
It's a man. He lived over 100 years ago.
He was, uh, Indian.

456
00:35:51,967 --> 00:35:54,671
- Dots not feathers.
- Not feathers. Yeah.

457
00:35:54,802 --> 00:35:56,842
Well, he lived in this tiny hut
somewhere in India.

458
00:35:56,971 --> 00:35:59,212
He had no formal education.

459
00:35:59,348 --> 00:36:01,885
- He had no access to any scientific work.
- Coffee?

460
00:36:02,017 --> 00:36:04,093
- You, sir? - Just
a little. - And, um...

461
00:36:04,227 --> 00:36:06,515
But he came across
this old math book.

462
00:36:06,646 --> 00:36:09,315
And from this simple text,
he was able to extrapolate theories...

463
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:11,349
that had baffled mathematicians
for years.

464
00:36:11,483 --> 00:36:14,519
Yes. Continued fractions.
Yeah, he, he wrote, uh...

465
00:36:14,652 --> 00:36:18,519
- Well, he, he mailed it to Hardy at Cambridge.
- Yeah. Cambridge. Yeah.

466
00:36:18,656 --> 00:36:21,859
And Hardy immediately recognized
the brilliance of his work...

467
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:25,491
and brought him over to England, and
then they worked together for years...

468
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:28,371
creating some of the most exciting
math theory ever done.

469
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:30,739
Uh, This, this Ramanugan...

470
00:36:30,875 --> 00:36:34,919
his, his genius was unparalleled, Sean.

471
00:36:35,045 --> 00:36:38,294
Well, this boy's just like that.

472
00:36:38,423 --> 00:36:41,957
But he's, um, he's a bit defensive.

473
00:36:42,092 --> 00:36:45,128
And I need someone
who can get through to him.

474
00:36:45,262 --> 00:36:47,883
- Like me?
- Yeah, like you.

475
00:36:48,014 --> 00:36:50,718
- Why?
- Well, because you have the same kind of background.

476
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:54,099
- What background?
- Well, you're from the same neighbourhood.

477
00:36:54,228 --> 00:36:56,801
- He's from Southie?
- Yeah.

478
00:36:56,938 --> 00:36:59,180
Boy genius from Southie.

479
00:37:00,525 --> 00:37:04,652
- How many shrinks you go to before me?
- Five.

480
00:37:05,696 --> 00:37:07,439
- Let me guess. Barry?
- Yeah.

481
00:37:07,572 --> 00:37:09,066
- Henry? -
Yeah. - Not Rick?

482
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:12,234
Sean, please,
just meet with him once a week.

483
00:37:12,368 --> 00:37:14,277
Please?

484
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:20,575
Lt's a poker game with this kid.
Don't let him know what you've got.

485
00:37:20,708 --> 00:37:23,578
He's probably even read your book,
if he could find it.

486
00:37:23,711 --> 00:37:26,036
It's gonna be hard for him to find.

487
00:37:26,171 --> 00:37:27,665
- Hi, Will.
- Hi.

488
00:37:27,798 --> 00:37:29,754
This is Sean Maguire. Will Hunting.

489
00:37:29,883 --> 00:37:32,290
How are ya?

490
00:37:36,054 --> 00:37:38,094
- Yeah, let's get started.
- Yeah, let's do it.

491
00:37:38,223 --> 00:37:40,262
I'm pumped!
Let's let the healing begin.

492
00:37:40,391 --> 00:37:43,890
- Will you excuse us?
- Yeah, please, Tom.

493
00:37:44,020 --> 00:37:48,562
- You, too, Gerry.
- Yeah, of course.

494
00:37:54,070 --> 00:37:56,441
How are you?

495
00:37:57,906 --> 00:37:59,945
Where are you from in Southie?

496
00:38:00,075 --> 00:38:03,028
- I like what you've done with the place.
- Oh, thanks.

497
00:38:03,161 --> 00:38:06,446
Do you buy all these books retail,
or do you send away for like...

498
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,616
a shrink kit that comes
with all these volumes included?

499
00:38:09,750 --> 00:38:13,248
- Do you like books?
- Yeah.

500
00:38:13,378 --> 00:38:15,915
- Did you read any of these books?
- I don't know.

501
00:38:16,047 --> 00:38:18,418
- How about any of these books?
- Probably not.

502
00:38:18,549 --> 00:38:22,332
What about the ones on the top shelf?
You read those?

503
00:38:22,469 --> 00:38:26,086
- Yeah, I read those.
- Good for you. What do you think about 'em?

504
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:29,139
Hey, I'm not here for a fuckin' book report.
They're your books. Why don't you read 'em?

505
00:38:29,266 --> 00:38:30,974
I did. I had to.

506
00:38:31,101 --> 00:38:34,884
- It must've taken you a long time.
- Yeah, it did.

507
00:38:41,276 --> 00:38:45,902
United States of America:
A Complete History, Volume I.

508
00:38:56,622 --> 00:38:58,698
Jesus.

509
00:38:58,833 --> 00:39:02,118
If you wanna read a real history book, read Howard
Zinn's A People's History of the United States.

510
00:39:02,252 --> 00:39:04,126
That book will fuckin' knock you
on your ass.

511
00:39:04,254 --> 00:39:06,163
Better than Chomsky's
Manufacturing Consent?

512
00:39:06,297 --> 00:39:09,997
- Do you think that's a good book?
- You fuckin' people baffle me.

513
00:39:11,135 --> 00:39:13,092
You spend all your money
on these fuckin' fancy books.

514
00:39:13,220 --> 00:39:15,841
You surround yourselves with 'em.
They're the wrong fuckin' books.

515
00:39:15,972 --> 00:39:19,839
- What are the right fuckin' books, Will?
- Hey, whatever blows your hair back.

516
00:39:19,976 --> 00:39:22,680
Yeah. Haven't got much hair left.

517
00:39:22,811 --> 00:39:26,760
Hey, you know you'd be better off shoving that cigarette
up your ass. It'd probably be healthier for you.

518
00:39:26,898 --> 00:39:31,025
- Yeah, I know. It really gets in the way of my yoga.
- You work out, huh?

519
00:39:31,152 --> 00:39:33,856
- What, you lift?
- Yeah.

520
00:39:33,987 --> 00:39:35,980
- Uh, Nautilus?
- No, free weights.

521
00:39:36,114 --> 00:39:37,691
- Oh, really? - Yeah.
- Free weights, huh?

522
00:39:37,824 --> 00:39:39,615
- Yeah, big time. -
Yeah? - Just like that.

523
00:39:39,742 --> 00:39:42,031
- What do you bench?
- 285. What do you bench?

524
00:39:44,454 --> 00:39:46,530
You paint that?

525
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:50,080
Yeah. You paint? Do you sculpt?

526
00:39:50,209 --> 00:39:52,036
- No.
- Do you like art?

527
00:39:54,630 --> 00:39:56,539
Do you like music?

528
00:39:56,673 --> 00:39:58,712
This is a real piece of shit.

529
00:39:58,842 --> 00:40:00,715
Oh. Well, tell me
what you really think.

530
00:40:00,843 --> 00:40:04,176
Uh, just, uh, the linear
and impressionistic mix...

531
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,546
makes a very muddled composition.

532
00:40:06,682 --> 00:40:10,465
It's also a Winslow Homer rip-off, except
you got whitey, uh, rowin' the boat there.

533
00:40:10,602 --> 00:40:12,475
Well, it's art, Monet.
It wasn't very good.

534
00:40:12,603 --> 00:40:15,224
- That's not really what concerns me though.
- What concerns you?

535
00:40:15,356 --> 00:40:17,763
- Just the colouring.
- You know what the real bitch of it is?

536
00:40:17,899 --> 00:40:19,892
Lt's paint-by-number.

537
00:40:20,026 --> 00:40:22,481
Is it colour-by-number? Because
the colours are fascinating to me.

538
00:40:22,612 --> 00:40:24,189
- Aren't they, really? What about that?
- You bet.

539
00:40:24,321 --> 00:40:27,239
I think you're about one step away
from cuttin' your fuckin' ear off.

540
00:40:27,366 --> 00:40:29,441
- Really?
- Oh, yeah.

541
00:40:29,576 --> 00:40:33,324
Think I should move to the south
of France, change my name to Vincent?

542
00:40:33,454 --> 00:40:35,281
You ever heard the sayin',
"any port in a storm"?

543
00:40:35,414 --> 00:40:38,331
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Maybe that means you.

544
00:40:38,458 --> 00:40:39,834
In what way?

545
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:43,245
- Uh, maybe you're in the middle of a storm, a big fuckin' storm.
- Yeah, maybe.

546
00:40:43,379 --> 00:40:46,380
The sky's fallin' on your head. The
waves are crashin' over your little boat.

547
00:40:46,507 --> 00:40:48,713
The oars are about to snap.

548
00:40:48,842 --> 00:40:50,502
You just piss in you pants.
You're cryin' for the harbour.

549
00:40:50,635 --> 00:40:52,924
So maybe you do
what you gotta do to get out.

550
00:40:53,054 --> 00:40:55,379
You know, maybe you became
a psychologist.

551
00:40:55,514 --> 00:40:59,097
Bingo. That's it. Let me do my job now.
You start with me. Come on.

552
00:41:01,478 --> 00:41:05,226
- Maybe you married the wrong woman.
- Maybe you should watch your mouth!

553
00:41:06,982 --> 00:41:09,307
Watch it right there, chief,
all right?

554
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,777
Ah.

555
00:41:17,908 --> 00:41:20,031
Mmm, that's it, isn't it?

556
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:22,402
You married the wrong woman.

557
00:41:23,955 --> 00:41:28,284
What happened?
What, did she leave you?

558
00:41:28,417 --> 00:41:30,706
Was she, you know,
banging some other guy?

559
00:41:32,796 --> 00:41:36,211
Lf you ever disrespect my wife again,
I will end you.

560
00:41:36,341 --> 00:41:38,380
I will fuckin' end you.

561
00:41:38,509 --> 00:41:40,300
Got that, chief?

562
00:41:42,471 --> 00:41:46,302
- Time's up.
- Yeah.

563
00:41:59,610 --> 00:42:01,484
At ease, gentlemen.

564
00:42:07,659 --> 00:42:09,532
You okay?

565
00:42:14,998 --> 00:42:18,698
Look, I'll, I'll understand
if you don't wanna meet with him again.

566
00:42:18,835 --> 00:42:22,535
Thursday, 4:00.
Make sure the kid's here.

567
00:42:24,798 --> 00:42:27,086
Yeah.

568
00:42:27,217 --> 00:42:29,126
Thanks.

569
00:43:34,232 --> 00:43:36,354
Well, you look lovely in those glasses.

570
00:43:36,484 --> 00:43:38,227
- Thank you very much.
- They're just beautiful.

571
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:40,399
Yes, I always wanted
dark blue eye shadow.

572
00:43:40,529 --> 00:43:42,402
Wonderful.

573
00:43:45,032 --> 00:43:48,068
Growing up in England, you know,
I went to a very nice school.

574
00:43:48,202 --> 00:43:53,741
You know, it was kind of progressive,
organic, do-it-yourself, private school.

575
00:43:53,873 --> 00:43:58,084
Then Harvard. Hopefully med school.

576
00:43:58,210 --> 00:43:59,788
You know, I figured out,
at the end...

577
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:04,712
my brain's gonna be worth $250,000.

578
00:44:04,841 --> 00:44:07,082
That sounded horrible, didn't it?

579
00:44:09,053 --> 00:44:10,926
Bring me another mai tai!

580
00:44:12,055 --> 00:44:14,972
No, that's cool, I mean,
I bet your parents were happy to pay.

581
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:19,227
No, I was happy to pay.
I inherited the money.

582
00:44:19,353 --> 00:44:22,722
Wow. Well, is, uh,
is Harvard gettin' all that money?

583
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:25,726
No. Stanford. I'm going there in June
when I graduate.

584
00:44:25,859 --> 00:44:30,069
All right, so you just wanted to, to use
this sailor and then, uh, run away, huh?

585
00:44:30,196 --> 00:44:34,240
I was gonna, you know, experiment on you
for anatomy class first, obviously.

586
00:44:34,366 --> 00:44:36,323
Oh, in that case, that's fine.

587
00:44:36,451 --> 00:44:38,324
Hey, you wanna see my magic tricks,
Skylar?

588
00:44:38,453 --> 00:44:40,908
- Of course.
- All right. Promise...

589
00:44:42,790 --> 00:44:45,031
All right.

590
00:44:45,167 --> 00:44:48,867
- This one's for you, Rudolph.
- Wait, wait, you need my wand.

591
00:44:49,003 --> 00:44:51,624
All right, give me a hit.
Thank you. All right.

592
00:44:51,755 --> 00:44:53,748
I'm gonna make
all these caramels disappear.

593
00:44:53,882 --> 00:44:56,634
You ready? Ready.

594
00:44:56,760 --> 00:44:59,297
One, two, three.

595
00:45:00,596 --> 00:45:04,973
They're all gone. Yeah. That, that was...
It works better when I have my rabbit.

596
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:07,970
Well...

597
00:45:08,103 --> 00:45:10,558
I don't really date, you know,
that much.

598
00:45:10,688 --> 00:45:13,973
How very unfortunate, I think for me.

599
00:45:15,901 --> 00:45:18,854
You know what I mean.
I know you've been thinking about uh...

600
00:45:18,987 --> 00:45:20,730
- Oh, no, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

601
00:45:20,863 --> 00:45:23,947
- No, I really haven't.
- Yes, you have! You were hoping to get a good night kiss.

602
00:45:24,074 --> 00:45:28,321
No, you know, I tell ya.
I was hoping to get good-night laid.

603
00:45:29,579 --> 00:45:31,904
But I'll settle for like a good kiss,
you know.

604
00:45:32,039 --> 00:45:35,490
- How very noble of you.
- Thank you.

605
00:45:35,626 --> 00:45:38,579
No, I was, I was hopin' for a kiss.

606
00:45:39,921 --> 00:45:43,171
Well, I think we should just get it
out of the way now.

607
00:45:44,216 --> 00:45:46,789
- Right now?
- Yeah.

608
00:45:46,927 --> 00:45:48,800
Come on.

609
00:45:57,311 --> 00:45:59,848
I think I got some of your pickle.

610
00:46:11,239 --> 00:46:13,113
You again, huh?

611
00:46:14,492 --> 00:46:15,986
Come with me.

612
00:46:23,499 --> 00:46:28,326
So what's this? A Taster's Choice
moment between guys?

613
00:46:28,462 --> 00:46:31,712
This is really nice.
You got a thing for swans?

614
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:35,374
Ls this like a fetish? Ls it something
like maybe we need to devote some time to?

615
00:46:37,178 --> 00:46:41,389
I thought about what you said to me
the other day. About my painting.

616
00:46:41,515 --> 00:46:42,713
Oh.

617
00:46:42,849 --> 00:46:45,470
Stayed up half the night
thinkin' about it.

618
00:46:46,811 --> 00:46:49,017
Something occurred to me.

619
00:46:49,146 --> 00:46:53,606
I fell into a deep, peaceful sleep
and haven't thought about you since.

620
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:56,687
- You know what occurred to me?
- No.

621
00:46:56,819 --> 00:47:00,947
You're just a kid. You don't have the
faintest idea what you're talking about.

622
00:47:01,073 --> 00:47:04,572
- Why, thank you.
- It's all right.

623
00:47:04,701 --> 00:47:07,026
You've never been out of Boston.

624
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,912
Nope.

625
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:16,033
So if I asked you about art, you'd probably give
me the skinny on every art book ever written.

626
00:47:16,169 --> 00:47:20,036
Michelangelo.
You know a lot about him.

627
00:47:20,172 --> 00:47:23,541
Life's work. Political aspirations.
Him and the pope.

628
00:47:23,675 --> 00:47:28,135
Sexual orientation.
The whole works, right?

629
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:32,509
I bet you can't tell me what
it smells like in the Sistine Chapel.

630
00:47:34,726 --> 00:47:38,770
You never actually stood there
and looked up at that beautiful ceiling.

631
00:47:41,565 --> 00:47:44,103
Seen that.

632
00:47:44,234 --> 00:47:46,108
If I ask you about women...

633
00:47:46,236 --> 00:47:49,818
you'll probably give me a syllabus
of your personal favourites.

634
00:47:49,947 --> 00:47:52,438
You may have even been laid
a few times.

635
00:47:58,246 --> 00:48:01,412
But you can't tell me what it feels like
to wake up next to a woman...

636
00:48:01,541 --> 00:48:03,865
and feel truly happy.

637
00:48:07,087 --> 00:48:08,960
You're a tough kid.

638
00:48:10,757 --> 00:48:14,339
I ask you about war, you'd probably, uh,
throw Shakespeare at me, right?

639
00:48:14,468 --> 00:48:17,753
"Once more into the breach,
dear friends. "

640
00:48:19,431 --> 00:48:22,384
But you've never been near one.

641
00:48:22,517 --> 00:48:25,268
You've never held
your best friend's head in your lap...

642
00:48:25,394 --> 00:48:29,391
and watch him gasp his last breath
lookin' to you for help.

643
00:48:31,691 --> 00:48:35,142
I ask you about love,
you'd probably quote me a sonnet...

644
00:48:36,779 --> 00:48:41,155
but you've never looked at a woman
and been totally vulnerable.

645
00:48:41,282 --> 00:48:45,362
Known someone that could
level you with her eyes.

646
00:48:45,494 --> 00:48:49,990
Feelin' like God put an angel on Earth
just for you...

647
00:48:50,123 --> 00:48:52,828
who could rescue you
from the depths of hell.

648
00:48:52,959 --> 00:48:56,244
And you wouldn't know
what it's like to be her angel...

649
00:48:56,378 --> 00:48:59,414
to have that love for her
be there forever.

650
00:48:59,548 --> 00:49:04,008
Through anything. Through cancer.

651
00:49:04,135 --> 00:49:08,179
And you wouldn't know about sleepin' sittin' up in
a hospital room for two months holding her hand...

652
00:49:08,305 --> 00:49:10,214
because the doctors could see
in your eyes...

653
00:49:10,349 --> 00:49:13,468
that the terms "visiting hours"
don't apply to you.

654
00:49:15,269 --> 00:49:17,392
You don't know about real loss...

655
00:49:17,521 --> 00:49:21,186
'cause that only occurs when you love
something more than you love yourself.

656
00:49:22,609 --> 00:49:26,024
I doubt you've ever dared
to love anybody that much.

657
00:49:28,948 --> 00:49:33,941
I look at you, I don't see
an intelligent, confident man.

658
00:49:36,162 --> 00:49:39,531
I see a cocky, scared shitless kid.

659
00:49:41,250 --> 00:49:44,583
But you're a genius, Will.
No one denies that.

660
00:49:44,711 --> 00:49:48,293
No one could possibly understand
the depths of you.

661
00:49:48,422 --> 00:49:51,376
But you presume to know everything about
me because you saw a painting of mine.

662
00:49:51,508 --> 00:49:54,177
You ripped my fuckin' life apart.

663
00:49:58,181 --> 00:50:00,137
You're an orphan, right?

664
00:50:04,561 --> 00:50:08,143
Do you think I'd know the first thing
about how hard your life has been...

665
00:50:08,272 --> 00:50:10,845
how you feel, who you are...

666
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:14,268
because I read Oliver Twist?

667
00:50:14,403 --> 00:50:16,810
Does that encapsulate you?

668
00:50:19,032 --> 00:50:21,569
Personally, I don't give a shit
about all that.

669
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:26,860
Because you know what? I can't learn anything
from you I can't read in some fuckin' book.

670
00:50:28,498 --> 00:50:32,661
Unless you want to talk about you,
who you are.

671
00:50:34,169 --> 00:50:38,213
Then I'm fascinated.
I'm in.

672
00:50:40,174 --> 00:50:42,926
But you don't wanna do that,
do you, sport?

673
00:50:45,554 --> 00:50:47,427
You're terrified
of what you might say.

674
00:50:53,519 --> 00:50:55,511
Your move, chief.

675
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,277
Hello? Hello?

676
00:52:06,831 --> 00:52:08,241
Hello?

677
00:52:09,208 --> 00:52:11,200
Professor Valenti,
are you calling me again?

678
00:52:15,004 --> 00:52:16,035
Freak.

679
00:52:18,049 --> 00:52:20,800
Oh. Oh, God.

680
00:52:20,926 --> 00:52:24,129
- Christ, who did you call?
- No one. I forgot the number.

681
00:52:24,262 --> 00:52:27,713
You fuckin' retarded? You went all the way out
there in the rain, and you didn't bring the number?

682
00:52:27,849 --> 00:52:31,015
No, it was your mother's 900 number.
I just ran out of quarters.

683
00:52:31,143 --> 00:52:34,346
Why don't we get off of mothers?
I just got off of yours.

684
00:52:35,647 --> 00:52:39,098
That's pretty funny, Morgan.
That's a fuckin' nickel, bitch!

685
00:52:39,233 --> 00:52:41,475
- Keep antagonizing me, watch what happens.
- All right, then, Morgan.

686
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:43,401
- Watch what happens. - All right,
then, Morgan! - Watch what happens.

687
00:52:43,528 --> 00:52:45,568
- What are you gonna fuckin' do to me?
- Keep fuckin' with me.

688
00:52:51,702 --> 00:52:53,575
No smoking.

689
00:53:25,522 --> 00:53:27,977
What do you mean, he didn't talk?
You were in there for an hour.

690
00:53:28,108 --> 00:53:31,310
He just sat there counting the seconds
until the session was over.

691
00:53:31,444 --> 00:53:34,148
- It's pretty impressive, actually.
- Why would he do that?

692
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:38,229
To prove to me he doesn't have
to talk to me if he doesn't want to.

693
00:53:38,366 --> 00:53:42,233
What is this? Some kind of staring contest
between two kids from the old neighbourhood?

694
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:46,319
Yeah, it is,
and I can't talk first.

695
00:53:46,457 --> 00:53:50,323
We know your theory, Alexander, but the
boy's found a simple geometrical picture.

696
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:54,504
- A tree structure won't work.
- Look now. He's joining the two vertices.

697
00:53:54,630 --> 00:53:58,544
- But I can do the sum.
- Well, it's how you group the terms, Alexander.

698
00:53:58,675 --> 00:54:01,592
But, Gerry, if we do the whole thing
this way, then...

699
00:54:01,719 --> 00:54:04,424
Hey, look, look.

700
00:54:04,555 --> 00:54:07,556
I wrote it down.
It's simpler this way.

701
00:54:18,484 --> 00:54:21,401
Sometimes people get lucky.

702
00:54:21,528 --> 00:54:23,437
You're a brilliant man.

703
00:55:00,769 --> 00:55:03,307
You know, I was on this plane once.

704
00:55:03,438 --> 00:55:06,011
And I'm sittin' there, and, uh...

705
00:55:06,149 --> 00:55:09,731
the captain gets on, he does his whole, you
know, "We'll be cruisin' at 35,000 feet. "

706
00:55:09,860 --> 00:55:11,899
But then he puts the mike down,
he forgets to turn it off.

707
00:55:12,988 --> 00:55:15,823
And so he turns to the copilot.
He's like, "You know...

708
00:55:15,949 --> 00:55:20,277
all I could use right now is
a fuckin' blow job and a cup of coffee. "

709
00:55:20,411 --> 00:55:24,408
So the stewardess fuckin' goes bombin' up from the
back of the plane to tell him the microphone's still on.

710
00:55:24,539 --> 00:55:27,244
This buy in the back of the plane's like,
"Hey, hon, don't forget the coffee. "

711
00:55:29,919 --> 00:55:31,792
You ever been on a plane?

712
00:55:31,921 --> 00:55:34,874
No, but it's a fuckin' joke. It works
better if I tell it in the first person.

713
00:55:35,006 --> 00:55:36,880
Yeah, it does.

714
00:55:40,052 --> 00:55:41,961
I have been laid, you know.

715
00:55:42,096 --> 00:55:44,586
Really? Goody for you.

716
00:55:44,723 --> 00:55:46,300
- Big time. Big time.
- Big time, huh?

717
00:55:46,433 --> 00:55:49,517
Yeah. I went on a date last week.

718
00:55:49,644 --> 00:55:52,561
- How'd it go?
- It was good.

719
00:55:52,688 --> 00:55:54,431
- You goin' out again?
- I don't know.

720
00:55:54,565 --> 00:55:56,356
- Why not?
- Haven't called her.

721
00:55:56,483 --> 00:55:59,733
- Christ, you're an amateur. -
I know what I'm doin'. - Really?

722
00:55:59,861 --> 00:56:04,024
Yeah. Don't worry about me.
I know what I'm doin'.

723
00:56:04,156 --> 00:56:06,444
Yeah, but this girl is like,
you know, beautiful.

724
00:56:06,575 --> 00:56:11,070
She's smart. She's fun. She's different
from most of the girls I've been with.

725
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:13,030
So call her up, Romeo.

726
00:56:13,164 --> 00:56:14,955
Why? So I can realize
she's not that smart?

727
00:56:15,082 --> 00:56:17,323
That she's fuckin' boring?
You know, I mean, you don't...

728
00:56:17,459 --> 00:56:20,910
This girl is like fuckin' perfect
right now. I don't wanna r-ruin that.

729
00:56:21,921 --> 00:56:24,921
Maybe you're perfect right now.
Maybe you don't wanna ruin that.

730
00:56:26,550 --> 00:56:28,589
But I think that's
a super philosophy, Will.

731
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:32,965
That way you can go through your entire life
without ever having to really know anybody.

732
00:56:37,142 --> 00:56:39,099
My wife used to fart
when she was nervous.

733
00:56:39,227 --> 00:56:41,552
She had all sorts
of wonderful idiosyncrasies.

734
00:56:41,688 --> 00:56:44,890
You know, she used to fart
in her sleep.

735
00:56:45,858 --> 00:56:47,815
Sorry I shared that with you.

736
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:51,442
And one night it was so loud,
it woke the dog up.

737
00:56:54,365 --> 00:56:56,073
She woke up and gone like,
"Was that you?"

738
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:59,153
I said, "Yeah. " I didn't have the heart
to tell her. Oh, God.

739
00:56:59,286 --> 00:57:01,777
- She woke herself up?
- Yes.

740
00:57:06,917 --> 00:57:12,124
Oh, Christ. Ah, but, Will, she's been dead
two years and that's the shit I remember.

741
00:57:12,255 --> 00:57:14,960
It's wonderful stuff, you know?
Little things like that.

742
00:57:15,091 --> 00:57:19,420
Yeah, but those are the things
I miss the most.

743
00:57:19,553 --> 00:57:22,719
The little idiosyncrasies
that only I knew about.

744
00:57:22,847 --> 00:57:25,172
That's what made her my wife.

745
00:57:25,308 --> 00:57:28,511
Boy, and she had the goods on me, too.
She knew all my little peccadillos.

746
00:57:29,436 --> 00:57:33,019
People call these things imperfections,
but they're not.

747
00:57:33,148 --> 00:57:35,638
Oh, that's the good stuff.

748
00:57:35,775 --> 00:57:39,274
And then we get to choose who we let
into our weird little worlds.

749
00:57:41,238 --> 00:57:43,230
You're not perfect, sport.

750
00:57:43,365 --> 00:57:45,404
And let me save you the suspense.

751
00:57:45,533 --> 00:57:48,534
This girl you met,
she isn't perfect either.

752
00:57:48,661 --> 00:57:52,409
But the question is whether or not
you're perfect for each other.

753
00:57:52,539 --> 00:57:55,908
That's the whole deal.
That's what intimacy is all about.

754
00:57:57,043 --> 00:57:58,537
Now, you can know everything
in the world, sport...

755
00:57:58,669 --> 00:58:02,038
but the only way you're findin' out
that one is by givin' it a shot.

756
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,877
You certainly won't learn
from an old fucker like me.

757
00:58:05,008 --> 00:58:09,385
Even if I did know,
I wouldn't tell a pissant like you.

758
00:58:09,512 --> 00:58:14,469
Yeah, why not? You told me
every other fuckin' thing. Jesus Christ.

759
00:58:14,599 --> 00:58:17,007
You fuckin' talk more than any shrink
I ever seen in my life.

760
00:58:17,143 --> 00:58:21,223
I teach the shit.
I didn't say I knew how to do it.

761
00:58:21,355 --> 00:58:23,264
Yeah.

762
00:58:27,902 --> 00:58:31,851
- You ever think about gettin' remarried?
- My wife's dead.

763
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:35,108
- Hence the word "remarried. "
- She's dead!

764
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:40,906
Yeah. Well, I think that's
a super philosophy, Sean.

765
00:58:41,038 --> 00:58:43,078
I mean, that way you can actually
go through the rest of your life...

766
00:58:43,207 --> 00:58:44,998
without ever really knowing anybody.

767
00:58:48,336 --> 00:58:49,616
Time's up.

768
00:59:05,017 --> 00:59:06,760
Hold it open.

769
00:59:06,894 --> 00:59:08,886
- Okay.
- Thank you.

770
00:59:22,031 --> 00:59:24,700
I am happy with you

771
00:59:25,951 --> 00:59:29,865
I know I'm about to love you

772
00:59:29,996 --> 00:59:35,334
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know him

773
00:59:35,459 --> 00:59:38,413
Oh, my, you made me...

774
00:59:38,545 --> 00:59:40,917
"G" minor seventh.
Saddest of all chords.

775
00:59:43,341 --> 00:59:45,132
- Hello.
- Hey.

776
00:59:45,259 --> 00:59:48,094
- Where have you been?
- I'm sorry. I've been like...

777
00:59:48,220 --> 00:59:50,841
I've been really busy, and...
But, um...

778
00:59:50,972 --> 00:59:53,545
Me, too. Yeah.

779
00:59:53,683 --> 00:59:56,470
I... I thought you'd call.

780
00:59:58,187 --> 01:00:00,013
Yeah. Um...

781
01:00:00,147 --> 01:00:02,104
- I mean, we had a really good time.
- I had a really good time, too.

782
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,271
I mean, I just... I...

783
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,309
I'm sorry, you know.
I, I blew it.

784
01:00:06,444 --> 01:00:08,769
No, no. I mean, you know,
it's all right.

785
01:00:08,904 --> 01:00:14,028
Yeah. Uh, so I was, I was wonderin' if, uh,
if, you know, you'd give me another crack at it.

786
01:00:14,159 --> 01:00:17,823
- You know, let me take you out again.
- Oh, I can't.

787
01:00:19,038 --> 01:00:20,947
- All right.
- Oh, no. I didn't...

788
01:00:21,081 --> 01:00:24,913
I didn't mean I can't, like ever.
I just can't right now.

789
01:00:25,043 --> 01:00:27,996
I've got to assign the proton spectrum
for "ebogamine. "

790
01:00:28,129 --> 01:00:30,038
All that sounds really, really
interesting.

791
01:00:30,172 --> 01:00:32,046
It's actually fantastically boring.

792
01:00:32,174 --> 01:00:34,878
- All right, um...
- But, um, maybe some other time.

793
01:00:35,010 --> 01:00:38,378
- Like tomorrow?
- Um, yeah, all right.

794
01:00:38,513 --> 01:00:40,801
- Okay.
- Okay.

795
01:00:40,931 --> 01:00:42,805
- Bye.
- Bye.

796
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:00,649
- What are you doing here?
- I couldn't wait till tomorrow.

797
01:01:02,241 --> 01:01:05,823
- Where the fuck did you get this?
- I had to sleep with someone in your class.

798
01:01:05,952 --> 01:01:09,617
Oh, I hope it was someone with the
open-toed sandals and the really bad breath.

799
01:01:11,707 --> 01:01:15,574
- Come on, let's go have some fun.
- No, I... I've got to learn this.

800
01:01:15,711 --> 01:01:18,248
Well, you're not goin' to his surgery
tomorrow, are you?

801
01:01:18,379 --> 01:01:20,372
- No.
- Let's go.

802
01:01:24,468 --> 01:01:27,919
Oh, my God. My dog is winning!

803
01:01:28,763 --> 01:01:30,341
Come on, Misty!

804
01:01:30,473 --> 01:01:33,094
Come on, run! Look at that!
Come on!

805
01:01:33,225 --> 01:01:35,099
Look, there he goes.
Misty, run! Come on!

806
01:01:36,103 --> 01:01:40,100
- And Misty flying down the track.
- We won.

807
01:01:40,231 --> 01:01:42,140
I totally won!

808
01:01:44,193 --> 01:01:48,107
- So did you grow up around here, then?
- Not far. South Boston.

809
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:53,065
- Still glowing from my win.
- Yeah, I know. Look at you.

810
01:01:53,201 --> 01:01:55,074
You're so happy.

811
01:01:57,246 --> 01:02:02,203
- What was that like then?
- It was, you know, normal I guess. Nothin' special.

812
01:02:03,584 --> 01:02:05,624
Do you got lots of brothers and sisters?

813
01:02:05,753 --> 01:02:08,374
- Do I have a lot of brothers and sisters?
- That's what I said.

814
01:02:08,505 --> 01:02:10,544
Well, Irish Catholic,
what do you think?

815
01:02:10,674 --> 01:02:13,081
Right. That's right.

816
01:02:14,552 --> 01:02:18,300
- How many?
- You wouldn't believe me if I told you.

817
01:02:20,015 --> 01:02:23,051
- Why? Go on. What? Five?
- No.

818
01:02:23,184 --> 01:02:26,387
Seven? Eight? How many?

819
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:28,643
- I have 12 big brothers.
- You do not have 12 brothers.

820
01:02:28,772 --> 01:02:31,559
I swear to God, I swear to God.
I'm lucky 13 right here.

821
01:02:31,691 --> 01:02:34,561
Do you know all their names?

822
01:02:34,694 --> 01:02:37,398
- Do I... Yeah, they're my brothers.
- What are they called?

823
01:02:38,739 --> 01:02:42,818
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

824
01:02:42,951 --> 01:02:45,027
Say it again.

825
01:02:45,161 --> 01:02:49,490
Marky, Ricky, Danny, Terry, Mikey, Davey,
Timmy, Tommy, Joey, Robby, Johnny and Brian.

826
01:02:51,458 --> 01:02:52,833
- And Willy.
- Willy?

827
01:02:52,959 --> 01:02:54,334
- Yeah.
- Will.

828
01:02:54,461 --> 01:02:57,496
Wow! Do you still see all of them?

829
01:02:57,630 --> 01:03:00,417
Yeah, well, they all live in Southie. I'm,
I'm livin' with three of 'em right now.

830
01:03:00,549 --> 01:03:01,664
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

831
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:05,667
- Well, I'd like to meet them.
- Yeah, we'll do that.

832
01:03:06,763 --> 01:03:08,173
Oh, you know, I read your book
last night.

833
01:03:08,306 --> 01:03:10,927
Oh, so you're the one.

834
01:03:11,058 --> 01:03:12,967
Do you still, uh, do you still
counsel veterans?

835
01:03:13,101 --> 01:03:14,299
- No, I don't.
- Why not?

836
01:03:14,436 --> 01:03:16,511
Well, I gave it up
when my wife got sick.

837
01:03:19,231 --> 01:03:22,351
You ever wonder what your life
would be like if you, uh...

838
01:03:22,484 --> 01:03:24,856
if you never met your wife?

839
01:03:24,986 --> 01:03:27,442
- What, wonder if I'd be better off without her?
- No, no, no.

840
01:03:27,572 --> 01:03:30,193
- I'm not saying like better off. I didn't mean it like that.
- No, it's all right.

841
01:03:30,324 --> 01:03:32,862
It's an important question.

842
01:03:32,993 --> 01:03:35,318
'Cause you'll have bad times,
but that'll always wake you up...

843
01:03:35,453 --> 01:03:37,612
to the good stuff
you weren't paying attention to.

844
01:03:38,414 --> 01:03:40,288
And you don't regret
meetin' your wife?

845
01:03:40,416 --> 01:03:43,037
Why? 'Cause the pain I feel now?

846
01:03:43,168 --> 01:03:47,497
Oh, I got regrets, Will, but I don't
regret a single day I spent with her.

847
01:03:52,885 --> 01:03:55,720
So when did you know, like,
that she was the one for you?

848
01:03:55,846 --> 01:03:58,515
October 21, 1975.

849
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,632
Jesus Christ, you know the fuckin' day?

850
01:04:00,766 --> 01:04:05,724
Oh, yeah, 'cause it was game six of the
World Series, biggest game in Red Sox history.

851
01:04:05,854 --> 01:04:07,052
Yeah, sure.

852
01:04:07,189 --> 01:04:10,889
My friends and I had, you know, slept out
on the sidewalk all night to get tickets.

853
01:04:11,025 --> 01:04:14,476
- You got tickets?
- Yep. Day of the game I was sittin' in a bar...

854
01:04:14,612 --> 01:04:18,062
waitin' for the game to start,
and in walks this girl.

855
01:04:18,198 --> 01:04:21,033
It was an amazing game, though. You
know, bottom of the 8th, Carbo ties it up.

856
01:04:21,159 --> 01:04:23,696
It was 6-6.
It went to 12.

857
01:04:23,828 --> 01:04:28,572
Bottom of the 12th, in stepped Carlton
Fisk, old Pudge. Steps up to the plate.

858
01:04:28,707 --> 01:04:30,414
- You know, he's got that weird stance.
- Yeah, yeah.

859
01:04:30,542 --> 01:04:33,412
And then, boom!
He clocks it, you know. High!

860
01:04:33,544 --> 01:04:35,951
Fly ball down the left field line!

861
01:04:36,088 --> 01:04:39,005
35,000 people on their feet
yellin' at the ball.

862
01:04:39,132 --> 01:04:41,504
But that's nothin', 'cause Fisk,
he's wavin' at the ball like a madman.

863
01:04:41,634 --> 01:04:43,377
- You know, "Get over! Get over!"
- Yeah, I've seen that. Right. Right.

864
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:46,714
"Get over!" And then it hits
the foul pole.

865
01:04:46,847 --> 01:04:51,508
Well, he goes ape-shit, and 35,000 fans,
you know, they charge the field. You know?

866
01:04:51,643 --> 01:04:53,931
- Yeah, and he's fuckin' blowin' people outta the way.
- And he's goin', goin', "Look out!

867
01:04:54,061 --> 01:04:56,101
Get outta the way!
Get outta the way!"

868
01:04:56,230 --> 01:04:59,349
I can't fuckin' believe you had tickets to
that fuckin' game! Did you rush the field?

869
01:04:59,483 --> 01:05:02,483
No, I didn't rush the fuckin' field.
I wasn't there.

870
01:05:02,610 --> 01:05:05,611
- What?
- No, I was in a bar having a drink with my future wife.

871
01:05:05,738 --> 01:05:07,695
- You missed Pudge Fisk's home run?
- Oh, yeah.

872
01:05:07,823 --> 01:05:10,111
To have a fuckin' drink with some lady
you never met?

873
01:05:10,242 --> 01:05:12,448
Yeah, but you should've seen her.
She was a stunner.

874
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:15,115
- I don't care if fuckin'...
- Oh, no, no, she lit up the room.

875
01:05:15,246 --> 01:05:18,200
- I don't care if Helen of Troy walks into the room! That's game six!
- Oh, Helen of Troy.

876
01:05:18,332 --> 01:05:21,368
Oh, my God. And who are these fuckin' friends
of yours? They let you get away with that?

877
01:05:21,501 --> 01:05:24,122
- Oh, they had to. - What do you mean,
they had? W- What did you say to 'em?

878
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,625
I just slid my ticket across the table
and I said...

879
01:05:26,756 --> 01:05:30,089
"Sorry, guys. I gotta see about a girl. "

880
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,375
"I gotta go see about a girl"?
Yeah, that's what you said?

881
01:05:32,511 --> 01:05:33,921
- I had to.
- And they let you get away with that?

882
01:05:34,054 --> 01:05:36,758
Oh, yeah. They saw it in my eyes
that I meant it.

883
01:05:36,889 --> 01:05:39,973
- You're kiddin' me?
- No, I'm not kidding you, Will.

884
01:05:40,100 --> 01:05:42,638
That's why I'm not talkin' right now about
some girl I saw at a bar 20 years ago...

885
01:05:42,769 --> 01:05:45,853
and how I always regretted
not goin' over and talkin' to her.

886
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:48,471
I don't regret the 18 years
I was married to Nancy.

887
01:05:48,607 --> 01:05:51,478
I don't regret the six years I had to
give up counselling when she got sick.

888
01:05:51,610 --> 01:05:54,397
And I don't regret the last years
when she got really sick.

889
01:05:55,947 --> 01:05:59,197
And I sure as hell don't regret
missin' a damn game.

890
01:05:59,325 --> 01:06:00,902
That's regret.

891
01:06:01,035 --> 01:06:02,908
Wow!

892
01:06:09,041 --> 01:06:10,915
Would've been nice
to catch that game, though.

893
01:06:11,043 --> 01:06:13,368
I didn't know Pudge
was gonna hit a home run.

894
01:06:16,464 --> 01:06:21,007
You know, I'm very, very useful
on the court. I'm extremely tall.

895
01:06:23,053 --> 01:06:25,758
- You're not that tall.
- I dunk.

896
01:06:28,474 --> 01:06:31,843
Will I ever play in the N.B.A.?

897
01:06:31,977 --> 01:06:35,144
"Lt is decidedly so. " Hmph.

898
01:06:37,982 --> 01:06:41,018
Why do we always stay here?

899
01:06:41,152 --> 01:06:43,228
'Cause it's nicer than my place.

900
01:06:43,362 --> 01:06:45,769
Yes, but I've never seen your place.

901
01:06:45,906 --> 01:06:48,064
I know.

902
01:06:48,199 --> 01:06:50,690
When am I gonna meet your friends
and your brothers?

903
01:06:50,827 --> 01:06:54,160
Oh. Well, they don't really
come down here that much.

904
01:06:54,288 --> 01:06:56,446
Well, I think I can make it
to South Boston.

905
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,371
It's kind of a hike.

906
01:07:00,501 --> 01:07:04,201
Is it me you're hiding from them
or the other way around?

907
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:07,338
- All right, we'll go.
- When?

908
01:07:07,466 --> 01:07:10,217
I don't know.
We'll go sometime next week.

909
01:07:10,343 --> 01:07:14,885
What if I said I would not sleep with you
again until you let me meet your friends?

910
01:07:20,352 --> 01:07:24,052
I'd say it's, like, 4:30 in the mornin'.
They're probably up.

911
01:07:24,188 --> 01:07:27,557
Oh, my God.
Men are shameless.

912
01:07:27,691 --> 01:07:30,775
If you're not thinking with your wiener,
then you're acting directly on its behalf.

913
01:07:30,902 --> 01:07:35,148
You bet. And on behalf of my wiener,
can I get like an advance payment?

914
01:07:35,281 --> 01:07:37,238
I don't know. Let's ask.

915
01:07:38,617 --> 01:07:40,858
- "Outlook does not look good. "
- What?

916
01:07:40,994 --> 01:07:43,567
Fuck the... Hey, Chuck. No, nothing.
Go back to sleep.

917
01:07:43,705 --> 01:07:46,788
"Outlook does not... " That's the same thing that told
you you was gonna play in the N.B.A. I think I'm in.

918
01:07:46,916 --> 01:07:49,952
Well, exactly, so look out. You better
start buying some season tickets.

919
01:07:52,712 --> 01:07:56,330
I- I plan to. I'm tall.
I like wearing shorts.

920
01:07:56,465 --> 01:07:58,256
Hook, hook. Dunk, dunk.

921
01:07:58,384 --> 01:08:01,088
- You're not that tall.
- Yes, I am.

922
01:08:01,219 --> 01:08:03,377
Maybe I'm all about three points.

923
01:08:04,430 --> 01:08:06,304
I'm all about home runs.

924
01:08:07,725 --> 01:08:11,093
Stop mixing your sporting metaphors.

925
01:08:23,572 --> 01:08:25,778
A leprechaun's got his dick
in the monkey's ass.

926
01:08:25,907 --> 01:08:29,571
And Morgan comes runnin' in, goin',
"I don't mind it. I don't mind... "

927
01:08:32,120 --> 01:08:35,785
Will, I can't believe you brought Skylar here
when we're fuckin' all bombed and drinkin'.

928
01:08:35,915 --> 01:08:37,955
I know, Morgan. It's a real rarity
we'd be all drinkin'.

929
01:08:38,084 --> 01:08:42,081
You know, my Uncle Marty drinks. You know.
He'll go on a bender for six, eight months.

930
01:08:42,212 --> 01:08:44,750
I ever tell you what happened to him when he
was drivin' up there and he got pulled over?

931
01:08:44,881 --> 01:08:46,624
- I told you guys, right?
- Marty, Marty, yeah.

932
01:08:46,758 --> 01:08:48,501
Let me tell you about... Let me tell ya
what happened to my Uncle Marty...

933
01:08:48,634 --> 01:08:50,876
because you oughta know this.

934
01:08:51,011 --> 01:08:54,427
He's always tellin' stories. Every time
we come here, he's got another story.

935
01:08:54,556 --> 01:08:58,387
But we all heard this one.
Go ahead, just say it anyway. Go ahead.

936
01:08:58,518 --> 01:09:02,301
I will go ahead. Thanks a lot.
Guess I have the floor now.

937
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:06,435
Um, yeah, my Uncle Marty's
drivin' home, right?

938
01:09:06,566 --> 01:09:11,311
Bombed out of his tree, right? Just
hammered out of his gourd. Just wrecked!

939
01:09:11,445 --> 01:09:13,936
This state trooper, uh, sees him
and pulls him over.

940
01:09:14,072 --> 01:09:16,990
So my uncle's fucked, basically. Got him out
of the car, and tried to make him walk the line.

941
01:09:17,117 --> 01:09:21,743
He gets out of the car, you know, pukes and the
guy statie's pretty sure he's over the legal limit.

942
01:09:21,871 --> 01:09:25,488
So, he's about to throw the cuffs on him
and put him in jail.

943
01:09:25,624 --> 01:09:29,668
All of a sudden, 50 yards down the road
there's this huge fuckin' boom, right?

944
01:09:29,794 --> 01:09:33,328
- So statie gets real spooked, and he turns around...
- He got shot?

945
01:09:33,464 --> 01:09:35,124
- No, no.
- So, so...

946
01:09:35,257 --> 01:09:38,174
- You've heard this story before.
- Yeah, Morgan, stop it. Stop it.

947
01:09:38,301 --> 01:09:41,752
Some other guy's car had hit a tree.
Okay? There was an accident.

948
01:09:43,472 --> 01:09:46,342
- Anyway... Shut the fuck up!
- How could he hear the other car accident if it wasn't right behind him?

949
01:09:46,475 --> 01:09:49,012
- I'm gonna break your neck. - You're driving
him nuts, Morgan. - Shut up! Okay, shut up.

950
01:09:49,144 --> 01:09:50,851
- Sorry.
- He told you the story once before. Go ahead.

951
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:53,386
So he tells my uncle,
"Stay here. Don't move. "

952
01:09:53,522 --> 01:09:57,685
So statie goes runnin' down the road
to deal with the other accident.

953
01:09:57,818 --> 01:10:01,400
After a few minutes of, of just lyin'
in his own piss and vomit...

954
01:10:01,529 --> 01:10:03,854
my uncle st-starts wonderin'
what he's doin' there.

955
01:10:03,990 --> 01:10:06,314
Gets up, gets in his car
and just drives home.

956
01:10:06,450 --> 01:10:09,367
Well, the next mornin',
my uncle's just passed out...

957
01:10:09,494 --> 01:10:11,533
and he hears this knocking at the door.

958
01:10:11,663 --> 01:10:14,747
So he goes downstairs,
fuckin' pulls the door open. "What?"

959
01:10:14,874 --> 01:10:16,866
Lt's the state trooper
that pulled him over.

960
01:10:17,001 --> 01:10:19,622
Statie says, "Fuck you mean, 'What? '
You know what.

961
01:10:19,753 --> 01:10:22,540
I pulled you over last night is what,
and you fuckin' took off. "

962
01:10:22,672 --> 01:10:24,960
He's like, "Bet you I never seen you
before in my life.

963
01:10:25,091 --> 01:10:27,961
I've been home all night with my kids.
I don't know who the fuck you are. "

964
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:31,296
He said, "You know who I am.
Let me get in your garage. "

965
01:10:31,429 --> 01:10:33,718
My uncle's like, "What?" He said, "You
heard me. Let met get in your garage. "

966
01:10:33,848 --> 01:10:36,517
My uncle's like, "All right, fine. " Takes
him 'round to the garage, opens the door.

967
01:10:36,642 --> 01:10:41,718
And there's... The statie's police
cruiser is in my uncle's garage.

968
01:10:43,189 --> 01:10:46,854
He was so fuckin'... He was so fuckin'
hammered, he drove the wrong car home.

969
01:10:46,984 --> 01:10:50,566
And the best part about it is
the fuckin' state trooper...

970
01:10:50,696 --> 01:10:53,151
had been so embarrassed,
he didn't do anything...

971
01:10:53,281 --> 01:10:56,650
'cause he'd been drivin' around all night
in my uncle's Chevelle lookin' for the house.

972
01:10:56,784 --> 01:11:00,698
All right, Chuck, what the fuck
is the point of your story?

973
01:11:00,829 --> 01:11:02,738
Well, he goes away.
That's the point.

974
01:11:02,873 --> 01:11:06,241
- All right. Well, question. Are you...
- Come on, stop.

975
01:11:06,376 --> 01:11:08,747
I'm tryin' to clarify somethin', probably
'cause you're too embarrassed to ask...

976
01:11:08,878 --> 01:11:10,751
'cause you know
it doesn't make any sense.

977
01:11:10,879 --> 01:11:13,714
It does make sense if you listen
to the story and quit askin' questions.

978
01:11:13,840 --> 01:11:17,090
Morgan, let's see if you can get this
one. I've got a little story for ya.

979
01:11:17,218 --> 01:11:22,674
All right. There's an old couple
in bed. Mary and Paddie.

980
01:11:22,806 --> 01:11:27,598
And they wake up on the morning
of their 50th anniversary.

981
01:11:27,727 --> 01:11:30,099
And Mary looks over
and gazes adoringly at Paddie.

982
01:11:30,229 --> 01:11:35,223
She's like, "Oh, Jesus, Paddie. You're
such a good-lookin' fella. I love ya.

983
01:11:35,358 --> 01:11:37,516
I want to give ya
a little present.

984
01:11:37,652 --> 01:11:40,688
Anything your little heart desires,
I'm goin' to give it to ya.

985
01:11:40,821 --> 01:11:42,695
What would you like?"

986
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:47,283
Paddie's like, "Oh, gee, Mary.
That's a very sweet offer.

987
01:11:47,410 --> 01:11:52,321
Now, in 50 years,
there's one thing that's been missin'...

988
01:11:52,456 --> 01:11:57,117
and, uh, I would like you
to give me a blow job.

989
01:11:57,252 --> 01:12:00,039
I would like for it. "
And Mary's like, "All right. "

990
01:12:00,171 --> 01:12:04,500
She takes her teeth out, puts them in
the glass, and she gives him a blow job.

991
01:12:04,633 --> 01:12:08,464
And afterwards, Paddie's like, "Yeah,
geez, now that's what I've been missin'.

992
01:12:08,595 --> 01:12:12,462
That was the most beautiful,
earth-shattering thing ever!

993
01:12:12,598 --> 01:12:14,674
Beautiful, Mary! I love ya!

994
01:12:14,808 --> 01:12:17,892
Ls there anything
that I can do for you?"

995
01:12:18,019 --> 01:12:22,645
And Mary looks up to him
and she goes, "Give us a kiss. "

996
01:12:22,773 --> 01:12:26,023
- Oh!
- Oh, my God!

997
01:12:26,151 --> 01:12:28,476
- That's filthy.
- Not that filthy. I've heard filthier.

998
01:12:32,949 --> 01:12:35,155
Get off of me! Lt's this fuckin'...

999
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:38,284
- All right, see you guys later.
- All right. Take it easy, Bill.

1000
01:12:40,455 --> 01:12:42,661
So, Skylar, thanks for comin' by.

1001
01:12:42,790 --> 01:12:44,747
Changed my opinion of Harvard people.

1002
01:12:44,875 --> 01:12:48,042
Ah, well, you don't want to rush the judgment on
that one 'cause, you know, they're not all like me.

1003
01:12:48,170 --> 01:12:50,921
Oh, well, I'm sure.
But it was nice to meet ya.

1004
01:12:52,257 --> 01:12:53,751
- Take it easy.
- Oh, all right.

1005
01:12:53,883 --> 01:12:56,421
- Slowly back away.
- Oh, come on. Hey. Brother.

1006
01:12:56,552 --> 01:12:59,755
I don't know what you're doin', dude.
You're givin' us a ride.

1007
01:12:59,888 --> 01:13:02,046
- What the fuck do I look like to you?
- Come on, Chuck.

1008
01:13:02,182 --> 01:13:04,257
Else you're walkin', bitch.
WilI's takin' the car.

1009
01:13:05,476 --> 01:13:07,515
All right. Thanks, Chuck.
I appreciate it.

1010
01:13:07,645 --> 01:13:10,431
Wait, wait. I don't know what
you're gettin' all serious about.

1011
01:13:10,564 --> 01:13:12,437
You're droppin' me off first.

1012
01:13:12,565 --> 01:13:15,056
- Dude, it's really out of the way.
- Oh, okay.

1013
01:13:15,193 --> 01:13:17,481
- It's real far. - Just 'cause you have
to sleep in your one-room palace tonight...

1014
01:13:17,611 --> 01:13:19,271
- don't start thinkin' you're bad.
- All right, come on.

1015
01:13:19,404 --> 01:13:21,646
Hey, wait a minute. You said
we were gonna see your place.

1016
01:13:21,781 --> 01:13:24,699
- No, not tonight.
- Oh, no, not tonight. Not any other night, hon.

1017
01:13:24,826 --> 01:13:28,609
He knows once you see that little shit-hole,
he's gettin' dropped like a bad habit.

1018
01:13:28,746 --> 01:13:30,785
But I wanted to meet
your brothers.

1019
01:13:30,914 --> 01:13:33,203
No. We're gonna do that another time.

1020
01:13:33,333 --> 01:13:35,206
All right.

1021
01:13:37,086 --> 01:13:39,493
Need them keys.

1022
01:13:39,630 --> 01:13:43,544
The stewardess hears this and
goes haulin' ass down the aisle.

1023
01:13:43,675 --> 01:13:46,960
And I yell,
"Don't forget the coffee. "

1024
01:13:47,095 --> 01:13:49,799
No shit!
You didn't say that.

1025
01:13:49,930 --> 01:13:51,923
- For Christ's sake, Marty, it's a joke.
- Yeah.

1026
01:13:52,057 --> 01:13:54,180
- I know someone that it actually happened to, Marty.
- A joke?

1027
01:13:54,309 --> 01:13:57,393
- Gerry. Have trouble findin' the place?
- Hi. No, I took a cab.

1028
01:13:57,520 --> 01:14:01,351
Timmy, this is Gerry.
We went to college together.

1029
01:14:01,482 --> 01:14:04,268
- How you doin'? Nice to meet ya.
- Pleased to meet ya.

1030
01:14:04,401 --> 01:14:08,101
- Can I get you a beer?
- Uh, no, just a Perrier.

1031
01:14:08,237 --> 01:14:10,064
That's French for club soda.

1032
01:14:10,197 --> 01:14:13,447
- Huh. Club soda, yeah.
- Yeah. A couple of sandwiches, too.

1033
01:14:13,575 --> 01:14:14,903
- Sure.
- Put it on my tab.

1034
01:14:15,035 --> 01:14:17,193
You ever plan on payin' your tab?

1035
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:19,570
Yeah, chief. Got the winning
lottery ticket right here.

1036
01:14:19,705 --> 01:14:21,247
- What's the jackpot?
- $12 million.

1037
01:14:21,373 --> 01:14:26,082
- I don't think that'll cover it.
- Yeah, but it'll cover your sex change operation.

1038
01:14:29,338 --> 01:14:31,710
- Nuts?
- No, thank you.

1039
01:14:35,886 --> 01:14:38,756
So, you wanted to talk about Will.

1040
01:14:38,888 --> 01:14:41,426
- Well, it seems to be going well.
- I think so.

1041
01:14:44,393 --> 01:14:47,097
Have you talked to him at all
about his future?

1042
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:50,763
No, we haven't gotten into that yet.
We're still bangin' away at the past.

1043
01:14:50,898 --> 01:14:54,433
Well, maybe you should. My phone's been
ringing off the hook with job offers.

1044
01:14:54,568 --> 01:14:58,399
- What kind?
- Well, cutting edge mathematics, think tanks.

1045
01:14:58,530 --> 01:15:01,863
The kind of place where a mind
like WilI's is given free rein.

1046
01:15:01,991 --> 01:15:04,529
That's, that's great
that there are offers...

1047
01:15:04,660 --> 01:15:06,617
but I, I don't really think
he's ready for that.

1048
01:15:11,374 --> 01:15:13,497
I'm not sure you understand, Sean.

1049
01:15:14,919 --> 01:15:17,623
- Well, what don't I understand?
- Here you go, guys.

1050
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:19,628
- Thanks, Tim.
- Yeah, thank you.

1051
01:15:19,756 --> 01:15:23,753
Just so you don't get
sticky fingers, huh?

1052
01:15:23,885 --> 01:15:27,087
Tim, can you help us?
We're tryin' to settle a bet.

1053
01:15:27,221 --> 01:15:28,501
Uh-oh.

1054
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,054
- You ever heard of Jonas Salk?
- Sure. Cured polio.

1055
01:15:32,183 --> 01:15:34,804
- Ever heard of Albert Einstein?
- Hey.

1056
01:15:37,104 --> 01:15:40,307
How about Gerald Lambeau?
Ever heard of him?

1057
01:15:41,608 --> 01:15:44,098
- No.
- Thank you, Tim.

1058
01:15:44,235 --> 01:15:46,108
- So, who won the bet?
- I did.

1059
01:15:49,615 --> 01:15:51,488
This isn't about me, Sean. I'm...

1060
01:15:53,409 --> 01:15:55,485
I'm nothing compared to this young man.

1061
01:15:59,081 --> 01:16:00,954
You ever hear of Gerald Lambeau?

1062
01:16:01,083 --> 01:16:04,083
In 1905 there were hundreds
of professors renown...

1063
01:16:04,210 --> 01:16:06,997
for their study of the universe,
but it was a...

1064
01:16:07,129 --> 01:16:10,296
It was a 26-year-old
Swiss patent clerk...

1065
01:16:10,424 --> 01:16:12,997
doing physics in his spare time
who changed the world.

1066
01:16:13,134 --> 01:16:15,008
Can you imagine if Einstein
would have given that up...

1067
01:16:15,136 --> 01:16:17,591
just to get drunk with his buddies
in Vienna every night?

1068
01:16:17,722 --> 01:16:22,347
We all would've lost something.
Tim would never have heard of him.

1069
01:16:22,476 --> 01:16:25,511
- Pretty dramatic, Gerry.
- No, it isn't, Sean.

1070
01:16:25,645 --> 01:16:28,182
This boy has that gift.

1071
01:16:28,314 --> 01:16:30,769
He just hasn't got the direction,
but we can give that to him.

1072
01:16:30,899 --> 01:16:33,520
Hey, Gerry,
in the 1960s...

1073
01:16:33,652 --> 01:16:36,142
there was a young man graduated
from the University of Michigan.

1074
01:16:36,279 --> 01:16:39,482
Did some brilliant work in mathematics.

1075
01:16:39,615 --> 01:16:41,857
Specifically,
bounded harmonic functions.

1076
01:16:41,992 --> 01:16:44,031
Then he went on to Berkeley.
He was assistant professor.

1077
01:16:44,161 --> 01:16:48,110
Showed amazing potential. Then he moved to
Montana and he blew the competition away.

1078
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:51,117
- Yeah, so who was he?
- Ted Kaczynski.

1079
01:16:51,250 --> 01:16:53,041
Haven't heard of him.

1080
01:16:53,168 --> 01:16:54,579
- Hey, Timmy!
- Yo!

1081
01:16:54,711 --> 01:16:57,877
- Who's Ted Kaczynski?
- Unabomber.

1082
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:04,502
That's exactly what I'm talking about.
We gotta give this kid direction.

1083
01:17:04,636 --> 01:17:07,341
He can contribute to the world, and,
and we can help him do that.

1084
01:17:07,472 --> 01:17:10,176
- Direction's one thing. Manipulation's another, all right?
- Sean!

1085
01:17:10,308 --> 01:17:13,641
- We have to let him find...
- Sean, I'm not sitting at home every night twisting my mustache...

1086
01:17:13,769 --> 01:17:16,686
and hatching a, hatching a plan
to ruin this boy's life.

1087
01:17:16,813 --> 01:17:19,730
I was doing advanced mathematics
when I was, when I was 18...

1088
01:17:19,857 --> 01:17:22,727
and it still took me over 20 years to do
something worthy of a Field's medal.

1089
01:17:22,860 --> 01:17:24,733
Well, maybe he doesn't want
what you want.

1090
01:17:24,862 --> 01:17:27,566
There's more to life
than a fuckin' Field's medal.

1091
01:17:27,697 --> 01:17:31,529
This is too important, Sean,
and it's above personal rivalry.

1092
01:17:31,659 --> 01:17:33,817
Wait a minute. Wait a minute, Gerry.
Let's talk about the boy.

1093
01:17:33,953 --> 01:17:36,906
Why don't we give him time
to figure out what he wants?

1094
01:17:37,039 --> 01:17:40,241
That's a wonderful theory, Sean.
It worked wonders for you, didn't it?

1095
01:17:40,375 --> 01:17:42,912
Yeah, it did,
you arrogant fuckin' prick.

1096
01:17:44,461 --> 01:17:47,747
Well, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry that I came here today.

1097
01:17:47,881 --> 01:17:50,004
I came here out of courtesy.
I- I wanted to keep you in the loop.

1098
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,209
Oh, nice to be in the loop.

1099
01:17:52,343 --> 01:17:55,877
The boy's in a meeting right now
I set up for him over at McNeil.

1100
01:17:56,013 --> 01:18:00,010
Well, Will, uh, I'm not
exactly sure what you mean.

1101
01:18:00,141 --> 01:18:02,015
We've already offered you
a position.

1102
01:18:02,143 --> 01:18:04,431
Nobody in this town works
without a retainer, guys.

1103
01:18:04,562 --> 01:18:08,013
You think you can find somebody who does,
let me tell you, you have my blessin'.

1104
01:18:08,148 --> 01:18:11,314
But I think we all know that person's
not gonna represent you as well as I can.

1105
01:18:11,443 --> 01:18:14,562
Will, our offer
i- is $84,000 a year plus...

1106
01:18:14,695 --> 01:18:19,606
Retainer
Retainer.

1107
01:18:19,741 --> 01:18:22,362
You want us to give you cash
right now?

1108
01:18:22,494 --> 01:18:26,538
Whoa-ho-ho. Go easy.
Now, I didn't say that.

1109
01:18:26,664 --> 01:18:31,788
Allegedly, your situation, for you...

1110
01:18:31,918 --> 01:18:34,124
would be concurrently improved...

1111
01:18:34,253 --> 01:18:38,001
if I had $200
in my back pocket right now.

1112
01:18:39,424 --> 01:18:43,587
Well, I don't think I-I can, uh, uh...
Larry?

1113
01:18:43,720 --> 01:18:47,883
- I've got $73.
- Uh, will you take a cheque?

1114
01:18:49,433 --> 01:18:52,636
Let me tell you somethin'.
You're suspect.

1115
01:18:52,769 --> 01:18:54,927
Yeah, you.

1116
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:59,226
I don't know what your reputation is
in this town...

1117
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:03,604
but after the shit you tried to pull
today, you can bet I'll be lookin' into you.

1118
01:19:03,737 --> 01:19:08,647
Now, any business
we have heretofore...

1119
01:19:08,783 --> 01:19:11,320
you can speak with
my aforementioned attorney.

1120
01:19:12,577 --> 01:19:16,491
Good day, gentlemen.
And until that day comes...

1121
01:19:16,623 --> 01:19:18,496
keep your ear to the grindstone.

1122
01:19:32,761 --> 01:19:34,670
- How's it goin'?
- Fine.

1123
01:19:34,805 --> 01:19:36,880
Yeah.

1124
01:19:37,015 --> 01:19:39,849
Good.

1125
01:19:39,976 --> 01:19:43,011
- You want some help?
- No.

1126
01:19:43,145 --> 01:19:45,849
- Come on. Give me one little peek, we'll go to the batting cages.
- No.

1127
01:19:48,149 --> 01:19:51,767
It is actually important
that I learn this.

1128
01:19:51,902 --> 01:19:55,686
- It's really important to me. Okay?
- All right. All right.

1129
01:19:57,824 --> 01:20:00,694
- So, why don't we just hang out here all day?
- Yes, why don't we?

1130
01:20:03,078 --> 01:20:06,661
All right, Mr Nosey Parker.

1131
01:20:06,790 --> 01:20:11,166
Seeing as you're intent
on breaking my balls...

1132
01:20:11,294 --> 01:20:13,167
let me ask you a question.

1133
01:20:13,295 --> 01:20:15,371
All right.

1134
01:20:15,506 --> 01:20:19,337
Do you have a photographic memory?

1135
01:20:19,467 --> 01:20:21,341
I don't know.
I just kinda remember, you know?

1136
01:20:21,469 --> 01:20:24,968
I mean, how do you remember your
phone number? You know? You just do.

1137
01:20:25,097 --> 01:20:28,050
- Well, have you studied organic chemistry?
- A little bit.

1138
01:20:28,183 --> 01:20:30,887
- Oh, just for fun?
- Yeah, for kicks.

1139
01:20:31,019 --> 01:20:33,805
Yeah, it's so much fun
studying organic chemistry.

1140
01:20:33,938 --> 01:20:36,475
Are you mad?

1141
01:20:36,607 --> 01:20:40,734
Have you completely lost your mind?
Nobody studies it for fun.

1142
01:20:40,860 --> 01:20:43,896
It's not a, a necessity,
especially for someone like you.

1143
01:20:44,030 --> 01:20:46,271
- Someone like me?
- Yeah.

1144
01:20:46,407 --> 01:20:50,534
Someone who divides their time fairly
evenly between batting cages and bars.

1145
01:20:50,660 --> 01:20:52,569
I mean, I would hardly say
it was a necessity.

1146
01:20:52,704 --> 01:20:54,079
Oh.

1147
01:20:55,456 --> 01:20:58,243
You know, there are very smart people
here at Harvard.

1148
01:20:58,375 --> 01:21:02,242
And even they have to study,
because this is really hard.

1149
01:21:02,378 --> 01:21:06,126
And yet, you do it so easily.

1150
01:21:06,257 --> 01:21:09,755
I don't understand. I, I, I don't
understand how your mind works.

1151
01:21:09,885 --> 01:21:12,589
- Do you play the piano?
- I want to talk about this.

1152
01:21:12,720 --> 01:21:14,760
No, I'm trying to explain it to you.
Do you play the piano?

1153
01:21:14,889 --> 01:21:19,266
- Yeah, a bit.
- All right. So when you, when you look at a piano, you see Mozart.

1154
01:21:19,393 --> 01:21:22,927
- I see "Chopsticks. "
- All right. Well, Beethoven, okay?

1155
01:21:23,063 --> 01:21:26,894
He looked at a piano, and it just
made sense to him. He could just play.

1156
01:21:27,024 --> 01:21:29,313
- So, what are you saying? You play the piano?
- No, not a lick.

1157
01:21:29,443 --> 01:21:33,274
I mean, I look at a piano, I see a bunch
of keys, three pedals and a box of wood.

1158
01:21:33,405 --> 01:21:38,113
But Beethoven, Mozart,
they saw it, they could just play.

1159
01:21:38,242 --> 01:21:41,860
I couldn't paint you a picture. I
probably can't hit the ball out of Fenway.

1160
01:21:41,995 --> 01:21:43,869
And I can't play the piano.

1161
01:21:43,997 --> 01:21:47,661
But you can do my O-chem paper
in under an hour.

1162
01:21:47,792 --> 01:21:49,867
Right. Well, I mean, when it came
to stuff like that...

1163
01:21:50,002 --> 01:21:51,959
I could always just play.

1164
01:21:54,714 --> 01:21:56,623
That's the best I can explain it.

1165
01:21:57,800 --> 01:22:00,587
- Come here. I have to tell you something.
- Huh?

1166
01:22:00,719 --> 01:22:03,424
- I have to tell you something.
- Oh.

1167
01:22:03,555 --> 01:22:05,631
Well...

1168
01:22:20,069 --> 01:22:24,647
- It's not fair.
- What's not fair? What?

1169
01:22:24,781 --> 01:22:27,817
I've been here for four years...

1170
01:22:27,951 --> 01:22:30,655
and I've only just found you.

1171
01:22:31,579 --> 01:22:33,820
Well, you found me.

1172
01:22:45,674 --> 01:22:47,713
Are you awake?

1173
01:22:47,842 --> 01:22:49,799
Nope.

1174
01:22:50,762 --> 01:22:52,801
Yes, you are.

1175
01:22:55,807 --> 01:22:58,927
Will, come to California with me.

1176
01:23:00,561 --> 01:23:02,435
What?

1177
01:23:04,481 --> 01:23:07,233
I want you to come to California
with me.

1178
01:23:12,488 --> 01:23:14,362
You sure about that?

1179
01:23:14,490 --> 01:23:17,027
Oh, yeah.

1180
01:23:17,159 --> 01:23:20,195
Yeah, but how do you know?

1181
01:23:20,328 --> 01:23:24,242
I don't know.
I just know.

1182
01:23:24,373 --> 01:23:27,243
Yeah, but h-how do you know?

1183
01:23:27,376 --> 01:23:32,452
I know because I feel it.

1184
01:23:32,588 --> 01:23:35,161
- 'Cause that's a really serious thing you're sayin'. I mean...
- I, I know.

1185
01:23:35,299 --> 01:23:37,754
You could be in California next week,
and you know...

1186
01:23:37,885 --> 01:23:41,383
you might find out something about me
you don't like, and, you know...

1187
01:23:41,513 --> 01:23:44,513
maybe you wish you hadn't said that, but
you know it's such a serious thing...

1188
01:23:44,640 --> 01:23:47,048
that you can't take it back,
and now I'm stuck in California...

1189
01:23:47,184 --> 01:23:49,971
with someone that doesn't really want to
be with me, just wish they had a take-back.

1190
01:23:50,103 --> 01:23:53,436
A what? What's a take-back?

1191
01:23:53,565 --> 01:23:55,889
I don't want a take-back.

1192
01:23:56,025 --> 01:23:59,607
I just want you to come
to California with me.

1193
01:23:59,736 --> 01:24:03,069
Well, I can't go to California
with you, so...

1194
01:24:05,533 --> 01:24:10,527
- Why not?
- Well, one, because I, I, I got a job here.

1195
01:24:10,662 --> 01:24:13,153
And two, because I live here.

1196
01:24:13,289 --> 01:24:17,239
Look, um, if you don't love me,
you should just tell me because...

1197
01:24:17,376 --> 01:24:20,377
I'm not sayin' I don't love you.

1198
01:24:20,504 --> 01:24:25,746
Then why? Why won't you come?
What are you so scared of?

1199
01:24:25,883 --> 01:24:27,840
What am I so scared of?

1200
01:24:27,969 --> 01:24:31,384
Well, what aren't you scared of?

1201
01:24:31,513 --> 01:24:35,297
You live in this safe little world where no one challenges
you, and you're scared shitless to do anything else.

1202
01:24:35,433 --> 01:24:38,469
- Because that might mean that you'd have to change.
- Don't, don't tell me about my world. Don't tell me about my world.

1203
01:24:38,603 --> 01:24:40,844
I mean, you just wanna have your little fling
with like the guy from the other side of town.

1204
01:24:40,980 --> 01:24:43,980
Then you're gonna go off to Stanford.
You're gonna marry some rich prick...

1205
01:24:44,107 --> 01:24:46,099
who your parents will approve of,
and just sit around...

1206
01:24:46,234 --> 01:24:49,816
with the other trust-fund babies and talk
about how you went slummin', too, once.

1207
01:24:49,945 --> 01:24:52,862
Why are you saying this?

1208
01:24:52,990 --> 01:24:55,527
What is your obsession with this money?

1209
01:24:55,659 --> 01:25:00,119
My father died when I was 13,
and I inherited this money.

1210
01:25:00,246 --> 01:25:05,584
You don't think every day I wake up,
and I wish I could give it back.

1211
01:25:05,709 --> 01:25:07,618
That I would give it back in a second...

1212
01:25:07,752 --> 01:25:10,290
if it meant I could have one more day
with him, but I can't.

1213
01:25:10,421 --> 01:25:12,497
And that's my life,
and I deal with it.

1214
01:25:12,631 --> 01:25:15,751
So don't put your shit on me
when you're the one that's afraid.

1215
01:25:15,884 --> 01:25:18,505
I'm afraid? W-W-What am I afraid of?
So, what the fuck am I afraid of?

1216
01:25:18,636 --> 01:25:21,127
You're afraid of me. You're afraid
that I won't love you back.

1217
01:25:21,264 --> 01:25:23,552
And you know what?
I'm afraid, too!

1218
01:25:23,682 --> 01:25:26,802
But fuck it, I wanna give it a shot.
And at least I'm honest with you.

1219
01:25:26,935 --> 01:25:30,849
- I'm not honest with you?
- No. What about your 12 brothers?

1220
01:25:30,980 --> 01:25:32,889
All right.

1221
01:25:33,023 --> 01:25:35,181
No, you're not going.
You're not leaving.

1222
01:25:35,317 --> 01:25:38,152
What do you wanna know? What?
That I don't have 12 brothers?

1223
01:25:38,278 --> 01:25:40,650
- That I'm a fuckin' orphan? No, you don't wanna hear that.
- I didn't know that. I didn't know that.

1224
01:25:40,780 --> 01:25:44,398
No, you don't wanna hear that. You don't wanna hear that I
got fuckin' cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid.

1225
01:25:44,533 --> 01:25:46,656
- Honey, I didn't know that.
- That this isn't fuckin' surgery.

1226
01:25:46,785 --> 01:25:50,154
That the motherfucker stabbed me.
You don't wanna hear that shit, Skylar!

1227
01:25:50,288 --> 01:25:52,779
- I do wanna hear that.
- Don't tell me you wanna hear that shit!

1228
01:25:52,915 --> 01:25:55,999
- I wanna hear it because I wanna help you, because I wanna be with you.
- Help me? What the fuck!

1229
01:25:56,126 --> 01:25:58,831
What do I got, a fuckin' sign
on my back that says, "Save me"?

1230
01:25:58,962 --> 01:26:00,420
- No.
- Do I look like I need that?

1231
01:26:00,547 --> 01:26:04,460
- No! God, I just want to be with you because I love you.
- Don't bullshit me. Don't bullshit me.

1232
01:26:04,592 --> 01:26:07,426
- Don't you fuckin' bullshit me!
- I love you. I love you.

1233
01:26:07,553 --> 01:26:10,008
I love you.

1234
01:26:11,347 --> 01:26:15,345
I wanna hear you say
that you don't love me.

1235
01:26:15,476 --> 01:26:17,515
Because if you say that...

1236
01:26:19,354 --> 01:26:21,393
then I won't call you...

1237
01:26:22,774 --> 01:26:25,810
and I won't be in your life.

1238
01:26:32,282 --> 01:26:34,523
I don't love you.

1239
01:26:38,412 --> 01:26:40,285
You don't...

1240
01:27:14,526 --> 01:27:18,570
Most people never get to see
how brilliant they can be.

1241
01:27:18,696 --> 01:27:21,400
They don't find teachers
that believe in them.

1242
01:27:21,532 --> 01:27:25,066
They get convinced they're stupid.

1243
01:27:25,201 --> 01:27:28,118
I hope you appreciate
what he's doing...

1244
01:27:28,246 --> 01:27:31,531
because I've seen how much
he enjoys working with you...

1245
01:27:31,665 --> 01:27:33,871
not against you.

1246
01:27:37,754 --> 01:27:39,627
Hello, Will.

1247
01:27:40,631 --> 01:27:42,873
Tom, can you get us some coffee?

1248
01:27:43,008 --> 01:27:44,882
Sure.

1249
01:27:48,429 --> 01:27:50,338
Now, let's see.

1250
01:27:56,394 --> 01:27:59,597
Good. This is correct.

1251
01:28:01,190 --> 01:28:03,478
I see you used Maclaurin here.

1252
01:28:03,609 --> 01:28:06,728
Yeah, I don't know what
you call it, but...

1253
01:28:07,737 --> 01:28:10,109
This can't be right.

1254
01:28:12,575 --> 01:28:15,065
This would be very embarrassing.

1255
01:28:18,580 --> 01:28:21,117
- Did you ever consider...
- I'm pretty sure it's right.

1256
01:28:21,249 --> 01:28:23,122
Hey, look, can we do this
at Sean's office from now on?

1257
01:28:23,250 --> 01:28:27,544
Because I, I gotta knock off work to
come here and the commute is killing me.

1258
01:28:27,671 --> 01:28:29,046
Yeah, sure.

1259
01:28:29,172 --> 01:28:31,248
- But did you think of the possibility...
- It's right.

1260
01:28:32,425 --> 01:28:36,422
It's right.
Just take it home with you.

1261
01:28:39,723 --> 01:28:41,632
What happened at the McNeil meeting?

1262
01:28:42,725 --> 01:28:46,936
I couldn't go. I had a date.
So, uh, so I sent my chief negotiator.

1263
01:28:50,774 --> 01:28:54,308
On your own time, you can do
whatever you like, Will.

1264
01:28:54,443 --> 01:28:57,148
But when I set up a meeting with,
with my associates...

1265
01:28:57,279 --> 01:28:59,734
and you don't show up,
it reflects poorly on me.

1266
01:28:59,865 --> 01:29:02,153
- Well, then don't set up any more meetings.
- Well, I won't.

1267
01:29:02,283 --> 01:29:04,608
I'll cancel them.

1268
01:29:04,744 --> 01:29:08,278
I'll give you a job myself. I, I just
wanted you to see what was out there.

1269
01:29:08,413 --> 01:29:11,580
Look, maybe I don't wanna spend the, the rest of my
fuckin' life sittin' around explaining shit to people.

1270
01:29:19,214 --> 01:29:22,168
I think you could show me
some appreciation.

1271
01:29:22,300 --> 01:29:25,384
A little appreciation? Do you know
how easy this is for me?

1272
01:29:25,511 --> 01:29:28,677
Do you have any fuckin' idea how easy
this is? This is a fuckin' joke.

1273
01:29:28,806 --> 01:29:30,679
And I'm sorry you can't do this.
I really am.

1274
01:29:30,807 --> 01:29:33,345
Because I wouldn't have to fuckin'
sit here and watch you fumble around...

1275
01:29:33,476 --> 01:29:35,385
and fuck it up.

1276
01:29:40,149 --> 01:29:43,766
Then you'd have more time to sit around
and get drunk instead, wouldn't you?

1277
01:29:43,902 --> 01:29:48,444
You're right. This is probably
a total waste of my time.

1278
01:30:02,584 --> 01:30:04,707
Yeah, you're right, Will.

1279
01:30:06,879 --> 01:30:09,548
I can't do this proof.

1280
01:30:11,175 --> 01:30:14,377
But you can. And when it comes to that,
it's only about...

1281
01:30:14,511 --> 01:30:17,844
It's just a handful of people in the world
who can tell the difference between you and me.

1282
01:30:17,972 --> 01:30:20,048
- But I'm one of 'em.
- Sorry.

1283
01:30:20,182 --> 01:30:22,340
Yeah, so am I.

1284
01:30:23,268 --> 01:30:25,640
Most days I wish I never met you...

1285
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:30,229
because then I could sleep at night.

1286
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:33,228
And I didn't, I didn't have to walk
around with the knowledge...

1287
01:30:33,360 --> 01:30:36,277
that there was someone like you
out there.

1288
01:30:42,409 --> 01:30:45,860
I- I didn't have to watch you
throw it all away.

1289
01:30:53,085 --> 01:30:55,410
Bill, hold it.

1290
01:30:55,546 --> 01:30:57,752
Did you hear that?

1291
01:30:58,673 --> 01:31:00,547
Morgan!

1292
01:31:00,675 --> 01:31:03,212
Lf you're watchin' pornos
in my mom's room again...

1293
01:31:03,344 --> 01:31:05,419
I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'.

1294
01:31:22,026 --> 01:31:24,980
What's up, fellas?

1295
01:31:25,112 --> 01:31:28,066
Morgan, dude, why don't you jerk off
in your own fuckin' house, dude?

1296
01:31:28,198 --> 01:31:32,444
- That's fuckin' filthy.
- I don't got a V.C.R. At my house.

1297
01:31:32,577 --> 01:31:36,444
- You're kiddin'.
- Come on. Not in my glove.

1298
01:31:36,580 --> 01:31:38,952
I didn't, I didn't use the glove.

1299
01:31:39,082 --> 01:31:40,956
That's my Little League glove.

1300
01:31:43,294 --> 01:31:45,999
What do you want me to do?

1301
01:31:46,130 --> 01:31:48,288
I mean, what's wrong with you?

1302
01:31:48,423 --> 01:31:50,463
You'll hump a baseball glove?

1303
01:31:50,592 --> 01:31:53,960
I didn't. I didn't.
I just used it for the, for cleanup.

1304
01:31:55,054 --> 01:31:57,627
Will you stop jerkin' off
in my mother's room, please?

1305
01:31:57,765 --> 01:32:00,967
- Is there another V.C.R. In the house?
- It's just sad, bro.

1306
01:32:02,811 --> 01:32:07,436
So why do you think I should work
for the National Security Agency?

1307
01:32:07,565 --> 01:32:10,767
Well, you'd be working
on the cutting edge.

1308
01:32:10,901 --> 01:32:13,901
You'd be exposed to the kind of technology
that you wouldn't see anywhere else...

1309
01:32:14,028 --> 01:32:16,815
because we've classified it.

1310
01:32:16,948 --> 01:32:20,482
Superstring theory,
chaos math, advanced algorithms.

1311
01:32:20,617 --> 01:32:23,618
Code breaking.

1312
01:32:23,745 --> 01:32:26,366
Well, that's one aspect
of what we do.

1313
01:32:26,497 --> 01:32:28,371
Oh, come on.
I mean, that is what you do.

1314
01:32:28,499 --> 01:32:31,535
You guys handle 80%
of the intelligence workload.

1315
01:32:31,668 --> 01:32:34,159
You're seven times the size
of the C.I.A.

1316
01:32:34,296 --> 01:32:37,331
We don't like to brag
about that, Will.

1317
01:32:37,465 --> 01:32:40,631
But you're exactly right.

1318
01:32:40,759 --> 01:32:43,962
So, the way I see it,
the question isn't...

1319
01:32:44,095 --> 01:32:46,668
"Why should you work for the N.S.A.?"

1320
01:32:46,806 --> 01:32:49,344
The question is:
"Why shouldn't you?"

1321
01:32:49,475 --> 01:32:53,223
Why shouldn't I work for the N.S.A.?

1322
01:32:53,353 --> 01:32:57,302
That's a tough one,
but I'll take a shot.

1323
01:32:57,440 --> 01:32:59,847
Say I'm workin' at the N.S.A.
And somebody puts a code on my desk.

1324
01:32:59,984 --> 01:33:01,857
Somethin' no one else can break.

1325
01:33:01,986 --> 01:33:03,942
Maybe I take a shot at it,
and maybe I break it.

1326
01:33:04,071 --> 01:33:06,229
And I'm real happy with myself
'cause I did my job well.

1327
01:33:06,364 --> 01:33:09,815
But maybe that code was the location of some
rebel army in North Africa or the Middle East.

1328
01:33:09,951 --> 01:33:13,319
And once they have that location, they bomb
the village where the rebels are hidin'.

1329
01:33:13,454 --> 01:33:17,664
Fifteen hundred people that I never met,
never had no problem with, get killed.

1330
01:33:17,791 --> 01:33:20,791
Now the politicians are sayin', "Oh,
send in the marines to secure the area. "

1331
01:33:20,918 --> 01:33:23,456
'Cause they don't give a shit. It won't
be their kid over there gettin' shot.

1332
01:33:23,587 --> 01:33:25,461
Just like it wasn't them
when their number got called...

1333
01:33:25,589 --> 01:33:27,711
'cause they were all pullin' a tour
in the National Guard.

1334
01:33:27,841 --> 01:33:30,675
It'll be some kid from Southie
over there takin' shrapnel in the ass.

1335
01:33:30,802 --> 01:33:32,877
He comes back to find that the plant
he used to work at...

1336
01:33:33,012 --> 01:33:35,384
got exported to the country
he just got back from...

1337
01:33:35,514 --> 01:33:37,636
and the guy who put the shrapnel
in his ass got his old job...

1338
01:33:37,766 --> 01:33:40,683
'cause he'll work for 15 cents a day
and no bathroom breaks.

1339
01:33:40,810 --> 01:33:43,217
Meanwhile, he realizes the only reason
he was over there in the first place...

1340
01:33:43,354 --> 01:33:46,390
was so that we could install a government
that would sell us oil at a good price.

1341
01:33:46,523 --> 01:33:50,307
And, of course, the oil companies used a little
skirmish over there to scare up domestic oil prices.

1342
01:33:50,443 --> 01:33:52,317
A cute little ancillary benefit
for them...

1343
01:33:52,445 --> 01:33:54,935
but it ain't helpin' my buddy
at $2.50 a gallon.

1344
01:33:55,072 --> 01:33:57,064
They're takin' their sweet time
bringin' the oil back, of course.

1345
01:33:57,199 --> 01:33:59,405
Maybe they even took the liberty
of hirin' an alcoholic skipper...

1346
01:33:59,534 --> 01:34:02,700
who likes to drink martinis and
fuckin' play slalom with the icebergs.

1347
01:34:02,829 --> 01:34:04,904
It ain't too long till he hits one,
spills the oil...

1348
01:34:05,039 --> 01:34:07,576
and kills all the sea life
in the North Atlantic.

1349
01:34:07,708 --> 01:34:09,866
So now by buddy's out of work.
He can't afford to drive...

1350
01:34:10,001 --> 01:34:12,077
so he's walkin' to the fuckin'
job interviews, which sucks...

1351
01:34:12,211 --> 01:34:14,832
because the shrapnel in his ass
is givin' him chronic haemorrhoids.

1352
01:34:14,964 --> 01:34:17,371
And meanwhile, he's starvin' 'cause every
time he tries to get a bite to eat...

1353
01:34:17,508 --> 01:34:22,383
the only blue plate special they're servin'
is North Atlantic scrod with Quaker State.

1354
01:34:22,512 --> 01:34:24,385
So what did I think?

1355
01:34:24,514 --> 01:34:28,012
I'm holdin' out for something better.

1356
01:34:28,142 --> 01:34:31,344
I figure, fuck it. While I'm at it,
why not just shoot my buddy...

1357
01:34:31,478 --> 01:34:33,351
take his job,
give it to his sworn enemy...

1358
01:34:33,479 --> 01:34:35,935
hike up gas prices, bomb a village,
club a baby seal...

1359
01:34:36,065 --> 01:34:38,769
hit the hash pipe
and join the National Guard?

1360
01:34:38,901 --> 01:34:41,438
I can be elected president.

1361
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:44,772
- You feel like you're alone, Will?
- What?

1362
01:34:45,865 --> 01:34:48,272
Do you have a soul mate?

1363
01:34:48,409 --> 01:34:51,078
Do I have a...
Define that.

1364
01:34:51,203 --> 01:34:53,112
Somebody who challenges you.

1365
01:34:54,247 --> 01:34:56,156
- Uh, Chuckie.
- No, Chuckie's family.

1366
01:34:56,290 --> 01:34:58,863
He'd lie down
in fuckin' traffic for you.

1367
01:34:59,001 --> 01:35:02,500
No, I'm talkin' about someone who opens
up things for you, touches your soul.

1368
01:35:04,797 --> 01:35:08,131
- I got... I got...
- Who?

1369
01:35:08,259 --> 01:35:10,928
- I got plenty.
- Well, name 'em.

1370
01:35:11,053 --> 01:35:14,255
Shakespeare, Nietzsche, Frost,
O'Connor, Kant, Pope, Locke...

1371
01:35:14,389 --> 01:35:17,306
- That's great. They're all dead.
- Not to me they're not.

1372
01:35:17,433 --> 01:35:19,722
Nah. You don't have
a lot of dialogue with them.

1373
01:35:21,061 --> 01:35:22,935
You can't give back to them, Will.

1374
01:35:23,063 --> 01:35:25,470
Not without some serious smelling salts
and a heater.

1375
01:35:25,607 --> 01:35:27,646
Yeah. Yeah, that's what I'm saying.

1376
01:35:29,110 --> 01:35:31,232
You'll never have that kind
of relationship in a world...

1377
01:35:31,362 --> 01:35:33,568
where you're always afraid
to take the first step...

1378
01:35:33,697 --> 01:35:37,196
because all you see is every
negative thing ten miles down the road.

1379
01:35:37,325 --> 01:35:39,732
- You gonna take the professor's side on this?
- Don't give me a line of shit.

1380
01:35:39,869 --> 01:35:41,244
- No.
- Look, I didn't want the job.

1381
01:35:41,370 --> 01:35:43,777
It's not about the job. I don't care
if you work for the government.

1382
01:35:43,914 --> 01:35:46,998
But you can do anything you want.
You are bound by nothing.

1383
01:35:48,501 --> 01:35:52,000
What are you passionate about?
What do you want?

1384
01:35:52,129 --> 01:35:54,252
I mean, there are guys who work
their entire life layin' brick...

1385
01:35:54,381 --> 01:35:56,836
so their kids have a chance
at the opportunities you have here.

1386
01:35:56,967 --> 01:35:59,422
- I didn't ask for this.
- No.

1387
01:35:59,552 --> 01:36:01,959
You were born with it, so don't cop out
behind, "I didn't ask for this. "

1388
01:36:02,096 --> 01:36:05,429
What do you mean, "cop out"? I mean,
w- w-what's wrong with layin' brick?

1389
01:36:05,557 --> 01:36:08,308
- Nothin'.
- There's nothin' wrong with it. That's, that's somebody's home I'm buildin'.

1390
01:36:08,435 --> 01:36:13,143
Right. My day laid brick, okay? Busted
his ass so I could have an education.

1391
01:36:13,272 --> 01:36:16,771
Exactly. That's an honourable profession.
What's wrong with, with fixin' somebody's car?

1392
01:36:16,900 --> 01:36:19,355
Someone will get to work the next day
because of me. There's honour in that.

1393
01:36:19,486 --> 01:36:21,644
Yeah, there is, Will. There's honour
in that. And there's honour in...

1394
01:36:21,779 --> 01:36:23,771
you know, taking that
40-minute train ride...

1395
01:36:23,906 --> 01:36:26,361
so those college kids could come in
in the morning and the floors are clean.

1396
01:36:26,491 --> 01:36:28,199
And the wastebaskets are empty.
That's real work.

1397
01:36:28,326 --> 01:36:30,651
- That's right.
- Right. And that's honourable.

1398
01:36:30,787 --> 01:36:34,487
Sure, that's why you took that job.
I mean, for the honour of it.

1399
01:36:34,623 --> 01:36:36,532
I just have a little question here.

1400
01:36:36,667 --> 01:36:39,336
You could be a janitor anywhere.

1401
01:36:39,461 --> 01:36:43,125
Why did you work at the most prestigious
technical college in the whole fuckin' world?

1402
01:36:43,256 --> 01:36:46,505
And why did you sneak around at night
and finish other people's formulas...

1403
01:36:46,633 --> 01:36:50,500
that only one or two people in the world
could do, and then lie about it?

1404
01:36:53,181 --> 01:36:55,505
'Cause I don't see a lot of honour
in that, Will.

1405
01:36:58,810 --> 01:37:01,135
So what do you really want to do?

1406
01:37:05,358 --> 01:37:08,311
- I wanna be a shepherd.
- Really?

1407
01:37:08,443 --> 01:37:10,650
I wanna move up to Nashua,
get a nice little spread...

1408
01:37:10,779 --> 01:37:12,688
get some sheep
and tend to them.

1409
01:37:12,822 --> 01:37:15,692
- Maybe you should go do that.
- What?

1410
01:37:15,825 --> 01:37:18,529
You know, if you're gonna jerk off, why don't
you just do it at home with a moist towel?

1411
01:37:18,660 --> 01:37:20,202
- You're chuckin' me?
- Yeah, get the fuck outta here.

1412
01:37:20,329 --> 01:37:22,237
- Hey, no, no, no. Time's not up yet.
- Yeah, it is.

1413
01:37:22,372 --> 01:37:24,613
- I'm not leavin'. No.
- Listen, you're not gonna answer my questions.

1414
01:37:24,749 --> 01:37:27,584
- You're wastin' my fuckin' time.
- What? I thought we were friends. What do you mean, you...

1415
01:37:27,710 --> 01:37:31,244
- Playtime's over, okay?
- Well, why you kickin' me out, Sean? I mean, what... I mean...

1416
01:37:31,379 --> 01:37:34,713
You're lecturin' me on life?
Look at you, you fuckin' burnout.

1417
01:37:34,841 --> 01:37:36,999
- What winds your clock?
- Workin' with you.

1418
01:37:37,134 --> 01:37:40,170
Where's your soul mate? You wanna talk
about soul mates? Where is she?

1419
01:37:40,304 --> 01:37:42,379
- Dead.
- That's right, she's fuckin' dead.

1420
01:37:42,514 --> 01:37:45,183
She fuckin' dies, and you just
cash in your chips and you walk away?

1421
01:37:45,308 --> 01:37:49,435
- Hey, at least I played a hand.
- Oh, and you played a hand and you lost. You lost a big fuckin' hand.

1422
01:37:49,561 --> 01:37:52,895
And some people will lose a big hand like
that and have the sack to ante up again.

1423
01:37:53,023 --> 01:37:56,107
Look at me.
What do you wanna do?

1424
01:38:03,156 --> 01:38:07,105
You and your bullshit. You got
a bullshit answer for everybody.

1425
01:38:07,243 --> 01:38:11,074
But I ask you a very simple question,
and you can't give me a straight answer.

1426
01:38:12,789 --> 01:38:15,114
Because you don't know.

1427
01:38:16,751 --> 01:38:18,957
See ya, Bo-Peep.

1428
01:38:22,047 --> 01:38:24,205
- Fuck you.
- You're the shepherd.

1429
01:38:28,928 --> 01:38:30,967
Shepherd.

1430
01:38:31,097 --> 01:38:33,172
White little prick.

1431
01:38:34,516 --> 01:38:36,390
I just wanted to, you know, um...

1432
01:38:36,518 --> 01:38:39,969
call you up, uh, before you left, um...

1433
01:38:40,104 --> 01:38:42,143
I've been takin' all these, uh,
job interviews and stuff...

1434
01:38:42,273 --> 01:38:44,395
so I'm not gonna be
just a construction worker.

1435
01:38:44,525 --> 01:38:47,395
Well, you know,
I never really cared about that.

1436
01:38:48,987 --> 01:38:50,860
Yeah.

1437
01:38:53,991 --> 01:38:55,366
I love you.

1438
01:39:00,705 --> 01:39:02,199
Will?

1439
01:39:03,749 --> 01:39:05,124
You take care.

1440
01:39:05,250 --> 01:39:08,785
Someone's always comin'
around here

1441
01:39:08,920 --> 01:39:11,458
- Trailin' some new kill
- Bye.

1442
01:39:13,674 --> 01:39:15,750
Says I seen your picture

1443
01:39:15,884 --> 01:39:20,510
On a hundred dollar bill

1444
01:39:20,638 --> 01:39:24,718
What's a game of chance to you

1445
01:39:24,850 --> 01:39:27,305
In this world

1446
01:39:28,979 --> 01:39:32,394
Of real skill
So glad to meet you

1447
01:39:32,523 --> 01:39:36,900
Angeles

1448
01:39:38,695 --> 01:39:40,771
Pickin' up the ticket shows

1449
01:39:40,905 --> 01:39:44,605
There's money to be made

1450
01:39:46,493 --> 01:39:48,486
Go on, lose the gamble

1451
01:39:48,620 --> 01:39:53,246
That's the history of the trade

1452
01:39:53,374 --> 01:39:58,664
Did you add up
all the cards left to play

1453
01:40:01,923 --> 01:40:05,872
To zero
And sign up with people

1454
01:40:06,010 --> 01:40:08,631
Angeles

1455
01:40:10,138 --> 01:40:13,673
Don't start with me tryin'

1456
01:40:16,102 --> 01:40:18,509
Will, come on.
Will!

1457
01:40:20,689 --> 01:40:22,930
Will, that's it.
We're done here.

1458
01:40:23,066 --> 01:40:26,066
I'm sitting in your office
and the boy isn't here.

1459
01:40:27,820 --> 01:40:31,651
Well, it's ten past 5:00.
An hour and ten minutes late.

1460
01:40:31,782 --> 01:40:35,482
I can make you satisfied
in everything

1461
01:40:35,618 --> 01:40:37,741
Well, what if he doesn't show up
and I file a report...

1462
01:40:37,870 --> 01:40:39,744
saying he wasn't here
and he goes back to jail?

1463
01:40:39,872 --> 01:40:42,623
Lt won't be on my conscience.

1464
01:40:42,749 --> 01:40:45,703
Now becoming true

1465
01:40:45,835 --> 01:40:48,326
Okay. Fine.

1466
01:40:50,464 --> 01:40:52,338
What's up?

1467
01:40:54,259 --> 01:40:56,132
Thanks.

1468
01:41:01,015 --> 01:41:02,888
Fuck, that's good.

1469
01:41:06,561 --> 01:41:08,684
So how's your lady?

1470
01:41:08,813 --> 01:41:10,686
Ah, she's gone.

1471
01:41:11,982 --> 01:41:14,188
Gone? Gone where?

1472
01:41:14,318 --> 01:41:18,694
Uh, med school.
Medical school in California.

1473
01:41:18,821 --> 01:41:20,019
- Really?
- Yeah.

1474
01:41:20,156 --> 01:41:22,693
- When was this?
- It was like a week ago.

1475
01:41:27,579 --> 01:41:29,820
That sucks.

1476
01:41:32,333 --> 01:41:35,950
So, uh, when are you done
with those meetin's?

1477
01:41:36,086 --> 01:41:37,959
I think the week after I'm 21.

1478
01:41:38,088 --> 01:41:40,757
Yeah? They gonna hook you up
with a job or what?

1479
01:41:40,882 --> 01:41:45,093
Yeah. Fuckin' sit in a room and do
long division for the next 50 years.

1480
01:41:45,219 --> 01:41:48,552
Ah, probably make some nice bank though.

1481
01:41:48,680 --> 01:41:50,553
I'm gonna be a fuckin' lab rat.

1482
01:41:50,682 --> 01:41:54,050
Better than this shit.
Way outta here.

1483
01:41:54,185 --> 01:41:56,011
Well, uh, what do I want a way
out of here for?

1484
01:41:56,145 --> 01:41:58,682
I mean, I'm gonna fuckin' live here
the rest of my life.

1485
01:41:58,813 --> 01:42:00,889
You know, be neighbours.
You know, have little kids.

1486
01:42:01,024 --> 01:42:03,894
Fuckin' take them to Little League
together up Foley Field.

1487
01:42:07,196 --> 01:42:09,651
Look, you're my best friend
so don't take this the wrong way...

1488
01:42:09,781 --> 01:42:13,529
but in 20 years,
if you're still livin' here...

1489
01:42:13,659 --> 01:42:16,862
comin' over to my house to watch the
Patriot's games, still workin' construction...

1490
01:42:16,995 --> 01:42:19,071
I'll fuckin' kill ya.

1491
01:42:19,206 --> 01:42:21,827
- That's not a threat. That's a fact. I'll fuckin' kill ya.
- What?

1492
01:42:21,958 --> 01:42:24,081
What the fuck are you talkin' about?

1493
01:42:24,210 --> 01:42:28,159
- Look, you got something none of us have.
- Oh, come on. W-Why is it always this?

1494
01:42:28,297 --> 01:42:31,381
I mean, I fuckin' owe it to myself to do
this or that. What if I don't want to?

1495
01:42:31,508 --> 01:42:35,505
Oh, no, no, no. No, fuck you.
You don't owe it to yourself.

1496
01:42:35,636 --> 01:42:37,794
You owe it to me...

1497
01:42:37,930 --> 01:42:40,420
'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
and I'll be 50...

1498
01:42:40,557 --> 01:42:43,392
and I'll still be doin' this shit.

1499
01:42:43,518 --> 01:42:45,475
And that's all right. That's fine.

1500
01:42:45,603 --> 01:42:48,272
I mean, you're sittin' on
a winnin' lottery ticket.

1501
01:42:48,397 --> 01:42:52,097
And you're too much of a pussy
to cash it in, and that's bullshit.

1502
01:42:54,277 --> 01:42:56,946
'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything
to have what you got.

1503
01:42:57,071 --> 01:42:59,941
So would any of these fuckin' guys.

1504
01:43:00,073 --> 01:43:02,529
It'd be an insult to us
if you're still here in 20 years.

1505
01:43:02,659 --> 01:43:05,778
Hangin' around here
is a fuckin' waste of your time.

1506
01:43:05,912 --> 01:43:07,489
- You don't know that.
- I don't?

1507
01:43:07,622 --> 01:43:09,697
- No, you don't know that.
- Oh, I don't know that.

1508
01:43:09,832 --> 01:43:11,705
Let me tell you what I do know.

1509
01:43:11,833 --> 01:43:15,000
Every day I come by your house
and I pick you up.

1510
01:43:15,128 --> 01:43:19,125
And we go out and we have a few drinks
and a few laughs, and it's great.

1511
01:43:19,256 --> 01:43:21,877
You know what the best part
of my day is?

1512
01:43:22,009 --> 01:43:26,302
For about ten seconds, from when I pull
up to the kerb and when I get to your door.

1513
01:43:26,429 --> 01:43:28,468
'Cause I think maybe I'll get up there
and I'll knock on the door...

1514
01:43:28,598 --> 01:43:31,135
and you won't be there.

1515
01:43:31,266 --> 01:43:34,682
No "goodbye," no "see ya later. "
No nothin'. You just left.

1516
01:43:36,437 --> 01:43:40,055
I don't know much, but I know that.

1517
01:43:51,534 --> 01:43:53,740
This is a disaster, Sean.

1518
01:43:53,869 --> 01:43:56,442
I brought you in here because
I wanted you to help me with the boy.

1519
01:43:56,579 --> 01:43:58,655
- Not to run him out.
- I know what I'm doing with the boy, Gerry.

1520
01:43:58,790 --> 01:44:02,241
I don't care if you have a rapport with the boy! I
don't care if you have a few laughs, even at my expense.

1521
01:44:02,376 --> 01:44:04,914
But don't you dare undermine
what I'm trying to do here.

1522
01:44:05,045 --> 01:44:08,081
- Undermine?
- This boy is at a fragile point right now.

1523
01:44:08,214 --> 01:44:11,298
I do understand. He is at a fragile
point, okay? He's got problems.

1524
01:44:11,425 --> 01:44:14,924
Well, what problems does he have, Sean? That he's
better off as a janitor? That he's better off in jail?

1525
01:44:15,053 --> 01:44:17,970
Better off hanging out with a bunch
of retarded gorillas?

1526
01:44:18,098 --> 01:44:22,011
Oh, why do you think he does that, Gerry?
Do you have any fuckin' clue why? Hmm?

1527
01:44:22,143 --> 01:44:25,558
He can handle the problems. He can handle
the work, and he obviously handled you.

1528
01:44:25,687 --> 01:44:29,767
Gerry, listen to me. Listen. Why is he
hiding? Why doesn't he trust anybody?

1529
01:44:29,899 --> 01:44:33,268
Because the first thing that happened to him, he was
abandoned by the people who were supposed to love him the most.

1530
01:44:33,402 --> 01:44:35,774
- Oh, come on, don't give me that Freudian crap.
- Oh, no, listen, Gerry.

1531
01:44:35,904 --> 01:44:38,774
And why does he hang out with those
retarded gorillas, as you call them?

1532
01:44:38,907 --> 01:44:42,690
Because any one of them, if you asked them to,
would take a fuckin' bat to your head. Okay?

1533
01:44:42,827 --> 01:44:44,736
- That's called loyalty.
- Yeah, that's very touching.

1534
01:44:44,870 --> 01:44:48,819
And who is he handling? He pushes people
away before they have a chance to leave him.

1535
01:44:48,957 --> 01:44:51,448
It's a defence mechanism, all right?

1536
01:44:51,584 --> 01:44:54,122
And for 20 years he's been alone
because of that.

1537
01:44:54,253 --> 01:44:56,958
And if you push him right now, it's
gonna be the same thing all over again.

1538
01:44:57,089 --> 01:44:58,962
And I'm not gonna let
that happen to him.

1539
01:44:59,091 --> 01:45:00,750
- Now, don't you do that, Sean.
- What, Gerry?

1540
01:45:00,884 --> 01:45:03,754
Don't you do that. Don't infect him
with the idea that it's okay to quit.

1541
01:45:03,886 --> 01:45:06,803
That it's okay to be a failure,
because it's not okay, Sean.

1542
01:45:06,930 --> 01:45:10,513
And if you're angry at me for being, being
successful, for being what you could have been, Sean...

1543
01:45:10,642 --> 01:45:13,429
- I'm not angry at you, Gerry.
- Oh, yes, you're angry at me, Sean.

1544
01:45:13,561 --> 01:45:17,807
You resent me. But I'm not gonna
apologize for any, any success I've had.

1545
01:45:17,940 --> 01:45:20,477
You're angry at me for doing what
you could have done.

1546
01:45:20,609 --> 01:45:24,855
But ask yourself, Sean. Ask yourself
if you want Will to feel that way.

1547
01:45:24,987 --> 01:45:28,272
- Lf you want him to feel like a failure.
- Oh, you arrogant shit!

1548
01:45:28,407 --> 01:45:30,980
That's why I don't come
to the goddam reunions.

1549
01:45:31,118 --> 01:45:32,991
'Cause I can't stand
that look in your eye.

1550
01:45:33,119 --> 01:45:35,989
- You know, that condescending embarrassed look?
- Oh, come on, Sean.

1551
01:45:36,122 --> 01:45:38,161
You think I'm a failure.
I know who I am.

1552
01:45:38,290 --> 01:45:41,207
And I'm proud of what I do.
It was a conscious choice.

1553
01:45:41,335 --> 01:45:43,042
I didn't fuck up.

1554
01:45:43,169 --> 01:45:45,458
And you and your cronies think
I'm some sort of pity case.

1555
01:45:45,588 --> 01:45:49,288
You and your kiss-ass chorus following you around
going, "The Field's medal! The Field's medal!"

1556
01:45:49,425 --> 01:45:52,509
Why are you still so fuckin' afraid
of failure?

1557
01:45:52,636 --> 01:45:56,336
Lt's about my medal, is it? Oh, God, I could
go home and get it for you. You can have it.

1558
01:45:56,472 --> 01:45:59,805
Oh, please don't. You know... You know what, Gerry?
Shove the medal up your fuckin' ass, all right?

1559
01:45:59,934 --> 01:46:04,013
'Cause I don't give a shit about your medal because
I knew you before you were a mathematical god.

1560
01:46:04,145 --> 01:46:07,680
When you were pimple-faced and homesick, and
didn't know what side of the bed to piss on.

1561
01:46:07,815 --> 01:46:09,606
Yeah, you were smarter than me then
and you're smarter than me now.

1562
01:46:09,733 --> 01:46:11,809
So don't blame me for how your life
turned out. It's not my fault.

1563
01:46:11,944 --> 01:46:15,857
I don't blame you. It's not about you,
you mathematical dick!

1564
01:46:15,989 --> 01:46:18,526
Lt's about the boy.
He's a good kid.

1565
01:46:18,658 --> 01:46:22,026
And I won't see you fuck him up like
you're trying to fuck up me right now.

1566
01:46:22,161 --> 01:46:24,734
I won't see you make him feel
like a failure, too.

1567
01:46:24,871 --> 01:46:27,706
- He won't be a failure, Sean!
- But, but if you push him, Gerry...

1568
01:46:27,832 --> 01:46:30,667
- If you ride him...
- Sean, I am what I am today...

1569
01:46:30,793 --> 01:46:34,043
because I was pushed and
because I learned to push myself.

1570
01:46:34,171 --> 01:46:36,543
He's not you! Do you get that?

1571
01:46:38,716 --> 01:46:41,717
- I can come back.
- No, come in. Uh...

1572
01:46:41,844 --> 01:46:44,251
I was just leaving.

1573
01:46:54,563 --> 01:46:58,228
A lot of that stuff goes back a long way
between me and him.

1574
01:46:58,358 --> 01:47:00,564
You know. Not about you.

1575
01:47:05,906 --> 01:47:09,191
- What is that?
- This is your file.

1576
01:47:09,325 --> 01:47:11,697
I have to send it back to the judge
for evaluation.

1577
01:47:11,828 --> 01:47:14,614
Oh.

1578
01:47:14,747 --> 01:47:16,905
Hey, you're not gonna fail me, are you?

1579
01:47:20,668 --> 01:47:22,542
What's it say?

1580
01:47:24,046 --> 01:47:26,085
- Wanna read it?
- Why?

1581
01:47:29,551 --> 01:47:31,757
Have you had any, uh, experience
with that?

1582
01:47:31,886 --> 01:47:35,420
Twenty years of counselling.
Yeah, I've seen some pretty awful shit.

1583
01:47:36,390 --> 01:47:39,805
I mean, have you had any experience
with that?

1584
01:47:43,855 --> 01:47:46,262
Personally?

1585
01:47:46,398 --> 01:47:48,391
- Yeah.
- Yeah, I have.

1586
01:47:50,026 --> 01:47:51,437
It sure ain't good.

1587
01:47:55,531 --> 01:47:59,943
My father was an alcoholic.
Mean, fuckin' drunk.

1588
01:48:01,494 --> 01:48:04,411
He'd come home hammered,
lookin' to whale on somebody.

1589
01:48:04,539 --> 01:48:07,990
So I'd provoke him so he wouldn't
go after my mother and little brother.

1590
01:48:10,002 --> 01:48:12,623
Interesting nights
were when he wore his rings.

1591
01:48:14,464 --> 01:48:17,915
Yeah, he used to just put
a, uh, a wrench...

1592
01:48:18,050 --> 01:48:20,754
a stick and a belt
on the table...

1593
01:48:20,886 --> 01:48:23,174
and just say, "Choose. "

1594
01:48:23,305 --> 01:48:24,964
Well, I gotta go with the belt
there, then.

1595
01:48:25,098 --> 01:48:29,142
- I used to go with the wrench.
- Why the wrench?

1596
01:48:29,268 --> 01:48:31,344
'Cause fuck him, that's why.

1597
01:48:31,478 --> 01:48:34,811
- Your foster father?
- Yeah.

1598
01:48:34,939 --> 01:48:39,933
So, uh, you know, what is it? Like Will has
an attachment disorder? Ls it all that stuff?

1599
01:48:41,570 --> 01:48:44,143
Fear of abandonment?

1600
01:48:44,281 --> 01:48:47,483
Ls that why, uh, is that why
I broke up with Skylar?

1601
01:48:47,617 --> 01:48:50,950
- I didn't know you had.
- Yeah, I did.

1602
01:48:51,078 --> 01:48:53,154
- You wanna talk about it?
- No.

1603
01:48:57,166 --> 01:48:59,739
Hey, Will?

1604
01:48:59,877 --> 01:49:01,916
I don't know a lot.

1605
01:49:03,297 --> 01:49:06,380
But you see this?
All this shit?

1606
01:49:11,470 --> 01:49:13,379
This is not your fault.

1607
01:49:15,474 --> 01:49:17,845
Yeah, I know that.

1608
01:49:17,976 --> 01:49:19,849
Look at me, son.

1609
01:49:21,145 --> 01:49:23,470
It's not your fault.

1610
01:49:23,605 --> 01:49:28,017
- I know.
- No. It's not your fault.

1611
01:49:30,820 --> 01:49:33,026
- I know.
- No, no, you don't.

1612
01:49:33,155 --> 01:49:35,361
It's not your fault.

1613
01:49:37,367 --> 01:49:39,158
- I know.
- It's not your fault.

1614
01:49:39,285 --> 01:49:42,321
- All right.
- It's not your fault.

1615
01:49:45,165 --> 01:49:47,039
It's not your fault.

1616
01:49:47,167 --> 01:49:49,076
Don't fuck with me.

1617
01:49:51,921 --> 01:49:54,708
- It's not your fault.
- Don't fuck with me. All right?

1618
01:49:54,840 --> 01:49:57,876
- Don't fuck with me, Sean. Not you.
- It's not your fault.

1619
01:50:07,184 --> 01:50:09,757
It's not your fault.

1620
01:50:14,774 --> 01:50:16,647
Oh, my God!

1621
01:50:17,859 --> 01:50:21,773
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry. Oh, God.

1622
01:50:36,459 --> 01:50:38,367
Fuck them, okay?

1623
01:52:04,825 --> 01:52:07,150
- Can I help you?
- Yeah, I'm, uh, Will Hunting.

1624
01:52:07,285 --> 01:52:11,069
- I'm here about a position.
- Could you just have a seat for a moment?

1625
01:52:14,958 --> 01:52:18,493
Yes, there's a Mr Hunting in the lobby.
He's here for his appointment.

1626
01:52:38,478 --> 01:52:40,517
Which one did you take?

1627
01:52:40,647 --> 01:52:45,391
I was over at, uh, McNeil. It's one of
the jobs the professor set me up with.

1628
01:52:45,526 --> 01:52:49,854
Uh, I haven't told him yet, but I went, I
went down there and I talked to my boss, and...

1629
01:52:49,988 --> 01:52:52,941
My new boss.
He seemed like a good guy.

1630
01:52:53,074 --> 01:52:56,027
Is that what you want?

1631
01:52:56,160 --> 01:52:58,864
Yeah, you know, I think so.

1632
01:52:58,995 --> 01:53:02,079
Well, good for you.
Congratulations.

1633
01:53:02,206 --> 01:53:04,080
Thanks.

1634
01:53:07,211 --> 01:53:09,084
Time's up.

1635
01:53:12,090 --> 01:53:15,209
So that's, so that's it?
So we're, we're done?

1636
01:53:15,343 --> 01:53:18,047
Yeah, that's it.

1637
01:53:18,178 --> 01:53:20,550
You're done. You're a free man.

1638
01:53:22,348 --> 01:53:26,974
Well, um, I just want you
to know, Sean, that...

1639
01:53:27,102 --> 01:53:28,976
You're welcome, Will.

1640
01:53:34,400 --> 01:53:37,401
So, you know, I, I hope
we keep in touch, you know.

1641
01:53:37,528 --> 01:53:39,853
Yeah, me, too.

1642
01:53:39,988 --> 01:53:42,609
I'll be travelling around a bit,
and it'll be a little hard, but, uh...

1643
01:53:42,741 --> 01:53:46,405
I've got an answering machine at
the college I'll be checking in with.

1644
01:53:46,536 --> 01:53:49,986
So, here's the number.

1645
01:53:50,122 --> 01:53:52,659
You call that, and I'll
get back to you right away.

1646
01:53:54,417 --> 01:53:57,204
Yeah, you know,
I figured I'm just gonna...

1647
01:53:57,336 --> 01:54:00,669
put my money back on the table
and see what kind of cards I get.

1648
01:54:03,383 --> 01:54:05,755
You do what's in your heart, son.
You'll be fine.

1649
01:54:09,055 --> 01:54:10,762
Yeah.

1650
01:54:10,889 --> 01:54:12,965
- Thank you, Sean.
- Yeah.

1651
01:54:13,100 --> 01:54:15,092
Thank you, Will.

1652
01:54:16,811 --> 01:54:20,061
Hey, does this violate the, uh,
patient-doctor relationship?

1653
01:54:20,189 --> 01:54:22,395
Nah. Only if you grab my ass.

1654
01:54:26,111 --> 01:54:28,317
- Take care.
- You, too.

1655
01:54:28,446 --> 01:54:30,319
Yeah.

1656
01:54:32,282 --> 01:54:34,156
Hey.

1657
01:54:34,284 --> 01:54:36,609
Good luck, son.

1658
01:54:47,754 --> 01:54:49,793
Two beers!

1659
01:54:54,051 --> 01:54:57,300
- What's up? Did you guys go?
- No. I had to talk him down.

1660
01:54:57,429 --> 01:54:59,053
Why didn't you yoke him?

1661
01:54:59,180 --> 01:55:01,386
Uh, little Morgan's got
a lot of scrap to him.

1662
01:55:01,515 --> 01:55:04,682
You know, people try to whip his ass
every week. Fuckin' kid won't back down.

1663
01:55:04,810 --> 01:55:09,601
- What are you sayin' about me?
- Was I talkin' to you? Mind your fuckin' business.

1664
01:55:10,523 --> 01:55:12,930
- Go get me a beer.
- I ordered two beers.

1665
01:55:13,067 --> 01:55:15,225
- Hey, asshole.
- What, bitch?

1666
01:55:15,360 --> 01:55:18,859
- Happy birthday.
- Thought we forgot, huh, bitch? Fuckin' come on.

1667
01:55:18,989 --> 01:55:22,024
- Come on. I got ya first.
- I'm goin'. I'm goin'.

1668
01:55:22,158 --> 01:55:24,281
- All right, who's first?
- Come on, motherfucker.

1669
01:55:24,410 --> 01:55:28,027
- All right. Who's first? Come on. Who's first?
- Oh, Danny boy

1670
01:55:28,163 --> 01:55:30,155
Here's your present.

1671
01:55:31,708 --> 01:55:33,250
- Come on, brother.
- What?

1672
01:55:33,376 --> 01:55:37,124
Well, we knew you had to get back and
forth to Cambridge for your new job.

1673
01:55:37,254 --> 01:55:41,832
And, anyway, I wasn't gonna
fuckin' drive you every day, so...

1674
01:55:41,966 --> 01:55:43,626
- Fuckin' can't be.
- Morgan wanted to get you a "T" pass.

1675
01:55:43,759 --> 01:55:46,001
That's not what I was sayin'.

1676
01:55:46,136 --> 01:55:48,461
But, uh, 21 now, so...

1677
01:55:48,597 --> 01:55:52,096
You're legally allowed to drink, so we
figured the best thing for you, kid, was a car.

1678
01:55:52,225 --> 01:55:54,550
- How do you like it?
- This is like...

1679
01:55:57,313 --> 01:56:01,357
This is the ugliest fuckin' car
I ever seen in my life.

1680
01:56:01,483 --> 01:56:04,602
- Come on, brother.
- How'd you guys do this?

1681
01:56:04,735 --> 01:56:06,977
You know, me and Bill
scraped together the parts...

1682
01:56:07,112 --> 01:56:10,446
and, uh, Morgan was out
panhandlin' for change every day.

1683
01:56:10,574 --> 01:56:13,740
- I had the router do all the bodywork.
- Yeah, I have a fuckin' job, too, brother.

1684
01:56:13,868 --> 01:56:16,952
Guy's been up my ass for two years about
a job. I had to let him help with the car.

1685
01:56:17,079 --> 01:56:18,538
So you finally got a job,
huh, Morgan?

1686
01:56:18,664 --> 01:56:20,740
Yeah, had one.
Now I'm fucked again.

1687
01:56:20,874 --> 01:56:24,040
- So what is it, a lawn mower? What do ya got?
- It's a straight fuckin' six.

1688
01:56:24,169 --> 01:56:26,208
Me and Bill rebuilt this engine
ourselves here.

1689
01:56:26,337 --> 01:56:29,421
It's a good car, dude.
The engine's good. Engine's good.

1690
01:56:30,340 --> 01:56:33,839
- Happy 21, Will.
- Happy 21, brother.

1691
01:56:42,309 --> 01:56:44,218
Hi.

1692
01:56:44,352 --> 01:56:46,345
Come on in.

1693
01:56:49,023 --> 01:56:51,940
- Sean, I, um...
- Me, too, Gerry.

1694
01:56:53,485 --> 01:56:55,394
Yeah. Good.

1695
01:56:57,405 --> 01:56:59,113
- I heard you're takin' some time.
- Yeah.

1696
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:03,367
I'll travel a little bit,
maybe write.

1697
01:57:03,493 --> 01:57:05,367
So where are you going?

1698
01:57:05,495 --> 01:57:09,409
India and China and Baltimore.

1699
01:57:11,167 --> 01:57:13,206
Oh.

1700
01:57:13,335 --> 01:57:18,755
- You know when you'll be back?
- Well, I got this flyer the other day.

1701
01:57:18,881 --> 01:57:21,835
It says, uh, class of '72
is having a reunion in six months.

1702
01:57:21,967 --> 01:57:23,841
Yeah, I got one of those, too.

1703
01:57:23,969 --> 01:57:25,712
Why don't you come?
I'll buy you a drink.

1704
01:57:26,596 --> 01:57:28,589
The drinks at those things are free.

1705
01:57:28,723 --> 01:57:32,257
I know, Gerry.
I was being ironical.

1706
01:57:36,480 --> 01:57:39,017
Oh.

1707
01:57:39,148 --> 01:57:41,721
How about a drink right now?

1708
01:57:41,859 --> 01:57:43,602
Yeah, that's a good idea.

1709
01:57:43,736 --> 01:57:46,061
Come on. This one's on me.

1710
01:57:48,865 --> 01:57:50,988
- Got the winner right here, pal.
- Oh.

1711
01:57:51,117 --> 01:57:53,275
Yes, sir, this is the one.

1712
01:57:54,453 --> 01:57:56,944
This is my ticket to paradise.

1713
01:57:57,080 --> 01:57:58,954
Sean, do you know what the odds are
against winning the lottery?

1714
01:57:59,082 --> 01:58:02,118
- What, four to one?
- About 30 million to one.

1715
01:58:02,251 --> 01:58:06,200
- I still have a shot, you know?
- Yes, just about as big a chance...

1716
01:58:06,338 --> 01:58:09,292
as you being hit by lightning
here on the staircase right now.

1717
01:58:09,424 --> 01:58:11,167
Aw, that's a possibility, too, Gerry.

1718
01:58:11,301 --> 01:58:13,672
- I mean, 32 million. If you look at the size...
- Sean!

1719
01:59:43,128 --> 01:59:45,535
Will!

1720
02:00:04,479 --> 02:00:06,388
Will?

1721
02:01:14,080 --> 02:01:15,657
He's not there.

1722
02:01:32,721 --> 02:01:36,670
I'll fake it through the day

1723
02:01:36,807 --> 02:01:40,010
Sean, if the professor calls
about that job...

1724
02:01:40,143 --> 02:01:42,302
just tell him sorry.

1725
02:01:42,437 --> 02:01:45,640
I had to go see about a girl.
Will.

1726
02:01:48,150 --> 02:01:51,483
Son of a bitch.
He stole my line.

1727
02:01:55,281 --> 02:01:57,155
<i>With two tickets</i>

1728
02:01:57,283 --> 02:02:01,494
<i>Torn in half for LA</i>

1729
02:02:01,620 --> 02:02:05,238
<i>With nothing to do</i>

1730
02:02:05,373 --> 02:02:08,658
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1731
02:02:08,793 --> 02:02:12,457
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1732
02:02:12,587 --> 02:02:15,790
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1733
02:02:18,176 --> 02:02:22,422
<i>I know you'd rather see me gone</i>

1734
02:02:22,554 --> 02:02:25,389
<i>Than to see me</i>

1735
02:02:25,515 --> 02:02:29,678
<i>The way that I am</i>

1736
02:02:29,810 --> 02:02:34,555
<i>But I am in the life anyway</i>

1737
02:02:34,689 --> 02:02:37,524
<i>Next door</i>

1738
02:02:37,650 --> 02:02:41,813
<i>The TV's flashing blue</i>

1739
02:02:41,946 --> 02:02:45,528
<i>Frames on the wall</i>

1740
02:02:45,657 --> 02:02:48,527
<i>It's a comedy</i>

1741
02:02:48,660 --> 02:02:51,150
<i>Of errors, you see</i>

1742
02:02:51,287 --> 02:02:56,078
<i>It's about taking a fall</i>

1743
02:02:58,501 --> 02:03:00,375
<i>To vanish</i>

1744
02:03:00,503 --> 02:03:04,666
<i>Into oblivion</i>

1745
02:03:04,798 --> 02:03:08,498
<i>It's easy to do</i>

1746
02:03:08,635 --> 02:03:11,386
<i>And I try to be</i>

1747
02:03:11,512 --> 02:03:15,592
<i>But you know me
I come back</i>

1748
02:03:15,724 --> 02:03:19,970
<i>When you want me to</i>

1749
02:03:20,103 --> 02:03:23,518
<i>Do you miss me</i>

1750
02:03:23,647 --> 02:03:27,265
<i>Miss Misery</i>

1751
02:03:27,401 --> 02:03:30,899
<i>Like you say you do</i>

1752
02:03:46,333 --> 02:03:49,453
<i>Gonna find my baby
Gonna hold her tight</i>

1753
02:03:49,586 --> 02:03:53,168
<i>Gonna grab
some afternoon delight</i>

1754
02:03:53,297 --> 02:03:56,168
<i>My motto's always been
When it's right, it's right</i>

1755
02:03:56,300 --> 02:03:59,799
<i>Why wait until the middle
of a cold, dark night</i>
