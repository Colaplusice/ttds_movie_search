{12750}{12855}OK, Mr Straight, you need to take off all your closes|except your underwear and put this robe on.
{12855}{12923}Just bring me the doctor.
{13571}{13630}You like birds.
{13681}{13791}I build...uh, birdhouses...|uh, for bluebirds.

{14179}{14286}This morning you fall and can't|get up, that's your hips, Alvin.
{14286}{14400}-And you'll need a walker now.|-No walker.
{14427}{14481}Fine, a second cane, then.
{14481}{14576}You say you're having trouble seeing.|That could be a diabetes-related problem.
{14576}{14739}-I'd like to run some tests.|-No tests and no X-rays.
{14801}{14931}Well, I see and hear that you smoke.|My guess is you're in the early stages of emphysema.
{14931}{15090}And Alvin, you have circulation problems|and I'm worried about your diet.
{15106}{15247}If you don't make some changes quickly,|there will be some serious consequences.
{16421}{16561}-It has a... a red roof.|-Another pretty one, Rose.
{16561}{16711}-I want to...uh, paint the...uh, next one blue.|-That's a good idea.
{16896}{16981}What ...uh, did the doctor say?
{17041}{17129}He said|I was gonna live to be 100.

{25093}{25188}I've gotta go see Lyle.
{25213}{25263}But, Dad...
{25296}{25355}How are you...?
{25408}{25510}Well, I...haven't quite|got that figured yet.
{25878}{26003}One, your eyes are bad.|That's why you don't... uh, drive your car.
{26003}{26098}Uh, two, Uncle Lyle...|uh, lives in...uh, Wisconsin,
{26098}{26201}which is...uh, 317 miles away.
{26201}{26293}You would have to...uh,|stay all night...in Des Moines.

{26403}{26593}Three, you can hardly...uh, stand...|for two minutes...
{26593}{26713}And when you...uh, do stand up...|this...is the sound you make...
{26718}{26786}when you...stand.
{26979}{27067}Uh, four, uh,|you are...uh, 73 years old...
{27078}{27201}You were...uh, born|when, uh, Calvin...uh, Coolidge

{27320}{27408}Uh, you are...|uh, 73 years old, Dad.
{27408}{27489}And...I cannot drive you there.
{27500}{27586}Rose, darlin', I'm not dead yet.
{27678}{27759}Uh, what are we...|uh, building, Dad?
{27819}{27933}-Havin' a party?|-Oh, jeez,... I love...uh, parties.

{28526}{28673}It's...uh, for my dad,uh, for his...his trip.|Uh, my dad... he's going to...uh, Wisconsin.
{28683}{28768}I...asked him how|he's...uh, going to get there...
{28768}{28833}Uh...but he...|uh, won't say nothing.
{28833}{28939}-Wisconsin? That is a real party state.|-Yeah.
{28988}{29100}I...uh, hate... uh, Braun...uh...schweiger.|Yeah.
{29808}{29923}Alvin, you've got three|five-gallon cans there.
{29923}{29994}15 gallons of gas.
{29998}{30079}What do you need|so much gas for, Alvin?
{30093}{30163}Sig, you're one nosey|son of a gun.
{30163}{30213}You got that right.

{31064}{31124}-I...I...|- Well?
{31124}{31304}They're hard to come by, Alvin. It's gonna take me |two months to get another one on order.

{32464}{32579}-What do you need that grabber for, Alvin?|-Grabbin'.
{33879}{34034}Oh, jeez, Dad. Oh, jeez, Dad.
{34419}{34505}Listen to that|old grain elevator.
{34524}{34643}It's...uh, harvest time.
{34864}{35020}Uh, that...uh, trailer is too|h-heavy for...for that. It's a lawn mower.
{35020}{35147}You're going to... drive a...|a lawn mower to another state?
{35269}{35356}Rosie, I've...|I've gotta go see Lyle.
{35374}{35462}And I...I've gotta make|this trip on my own.
{35474}{35551}I know you understand.
{35673}{35725}I guess so.
{36004}{36071}Look up at the sky, Rosie.
{36359}{36462}The sky is sure full|of stars tonight.
{36955}{37072}Crimenetto, it's Alvin|and he's driving his lawn mower.
{37246}{37344}Alvin! What are you settin' out|to do here? For cry eye, Alvin!
{37408}{37536}Alvin, you're gonna get blown|right off the road, that's what I'm afraid!
{37784}{37854}He'll never make it|past The Grotto.
{41614}{41690}The Grotto.|8 km
{45046}{45126}I'm havin'|a little engine trouble.
{45126}{45201}What the heck is that|you're driving there?
{45201}{45306}It's a Rehds. Could you|give me a lift into town?
{45306}{45396}Yeah, to The Grotto. This|is the Sun Ray Tour. Get in.
{45396}{45515}- I'll get you help there.|- I'd appreciate that.
{45999}{46086}My Edward loved|his riding mower.
{46871}{46916}Hey, come here, hurry.
{46916}{46966}Hurry up.
{47301}{47358}Poor Alvin.
{47539}{47673}So the man...in a...pick-up,|he brought my dad back.
{47723}{47794}Ohh...mm, I must've been|at the beauty shop.
{47841}{47917}What kinda pick-up?
{48346}{48402}A Ford.
{48461}{48564}-But what's your dad doin' with that gun?|-I don't know.
{48759}{48837}I gave you that old Rehds|last time, right?
{48837}{48872}That you did.
{48907}{48968}You tradin' in that Rehds today?
{48978}{49060}No, I don't believe I will.
{49060}{49166}Pete told me you used that rider|in a real interestin' way.. You still plannin' to do that?
{49167}{49225}Still plannin it, Tom.
{49225}{49332}I know not to talk you out of|somethin' you set your mind to,
{49332}{49448}but Alvin, you've always|struck me as smart.
{49448}{49492}Well, that's appreciated.
{49492}{49550}Until now.
{49716}{49784}-What year?|-'66.
{49784}{49906}Has Kohler engine. We've used it for parts|but I always replace them.
{49906}{50053}The guts are good. It's got the old transmission.|Nothing fancy.
{50053}{50148}- Is it a good machine?|- It's good machine.
{50148}{50253}Tom, I got $325.|That's a fact.
{50253}{50343}That's sounds good to me, Alvin.|Let's go settle up with Alice.
{50343}{50503} One more thing, sometime you can find out | about these old machines, if you know who run 'em.
{50503}{50603}-Do you know who owned it?|-You bet... Me.
{50603}{50668}All right.
{55689}{55750}I couldn't get a ride.
{55884}{55949}Are you hungry?
{55969}{56029}Whaddaya got?
{56029}{56069} Weeners.
{56109}{56149} Weeners?
{56169}{56268} Weeners. Wanna try one?
{56649}{56719} Here's a good stick for you.
{57629}{57704} What a hunk of junk.
{57704}{57779} Eat your dinner, missy.
{59079}{59147} So,...how long you been|out on the road?
{59159}{59258} Well, I been travellin'|most of my life.
{59301}{59401}- Where you from?|- Laurens.
{59457}{59533} Got a wife back there? Kids?
{59569}{59709} My wife, Francis delivered|14 babies. Seven of 'em made it.
{59749}{59824} My daughter,|Rose lives with me.
{59871}{59956} Francis died in '81.
{60109}{60171} Where's your family?
{60284}{60366} Are you runnin' away?
{60565}{60640} How far along are ya?
{60705}{60780} Five months.
{61095}{61205} Well, I'm headin'|to see my brother Lyle.
{61265}{61320} Huh?
{61320}{61457} I said I'm goin' to see|my brother Lyle in Mount Zion.
{61457}{61540}- Where's that?|- Wisconsin.
{61540}{61595} Oh...|- Just across the state line.
{61595}{61640} Cheddar Heads.
{61660}{61770} Aren't those the dumbest things you ever seen|somebody stick on their head?
{61827}{61938} I hear that's|a real party place - Wisconsin.
{62005}{62085} Guess I'll never|get to find out.
{62270}{62370} There's a blanket in the trailer.|Why don't you go get it?
{63500}{63580} My family hates me.
{63660}{63747} They'll really hate me|when they find out.
{63820}{63921}- You didn't tell 'em?|- No.
{63945}{64089} No one knows.|Not even my boyfriend.
{64240}{64365} Well, they may be mad, but I don't think they're|mad enough to wanna lose you.
{64365}{64433} or your little problem.
{64465}{64500} I don't know about that.
{64500}{64540} Well, of course, neither do I, but...
{64540}{64645} a warm bed and a roof sounds a might better than...
{64645}{64785}... eatin' a hot dog on a stick with an old geezer|that's travellin' on a lawn mower.
{64980}{65030} My daughter Rose is...
{65055}{65150} Some people call her|a little bit slow but she's not.
{65180}{65300} She's got a mind|like a bear trap for facts.
{65310}{65405} She keeps everything|organised around the house.
{65430}{65560} She was a real good mom.| She had four kids.
{65580}{65750} One night, somebody else|was watchin' the kids and there was a fire.
{65770}{65850} Her second boy|got burned real bad.
{65890}{65960} Rose had nothin'|to do with it but, ah...
{65975}{66070}..on account of the way Rose is,|the State figured she
{66070}{66200} wasn't competent to take care of them kids | and they took 'em all away from her.
{66220}{66311} There isn't a day goes by that|she don't pine for them kids.
{66826}{66941} When my kids were real little,|I used to play a game with 'em.
{66946}{67061} I'd give each one of 'em a stick and| - one for each one of 'em -
{67061}{67161} then I'd say ''you break that.''|'Course they could, real easy.
{67186}{67316} Then I'd say ''tie them sticks in|a bundle and try to break that''.
{67316}{67371}'Course they couldn't.
{67386}{67531} Then I'd say ''that bundle - that's family.''
{67896}{67956} Why don't you sleep|in the trailer?
{67971}{68071} This chair's just fine|for me tonight.
{68123}{68201} No, I'll be fine|sleepin' out here.
{68206}{68281} Lookin' at the stars|helps me think.
{68791}{68821} Thank you.
{76467}{76497} What that?
{76532}{76562} Thanks.
{76592}{76622} What the hell?
{77382}{77442}- Doin' good.
{78478}{78513} Hey, Irene.
{78543}{78679}-You don't think about gettin' old when you're young.|-You shouldn't.
{78888}{78973} Must be something good|about gettin' old.
{79018}{79173} Well, I can't imagine anything|good about being blind and lame| at the same time, but... 
{79173}{79313} still at my age, I've seen about all|that life has to dish out.
{79333}{79533} I know to separate the wheat from the chaff|and let the small stuff fall away.
{79543}{79663} Let's go, man.
{79673}{79773} So, ah...what's the worst part|about being old, Alvin?
{79823}{79983}The worst part of being old is|rememberin' when you was young.
{82843}{82893}Can I help you, lady?
{82893}{82983}No, you can't help me.|No one can help me.
{82983}{83123}I've tried driving with my lights on,|I've tried sounding my horn! I scream, 
{83123}{83283} I roll the window down and bang on the door|and play Public Enemy real loud!
{83293}{83408} I've prayed to St Francis|of Assisi, St Christopher too! What the heck!
{83408}{83548} I've tried everything and still|every week I hit at least one deer!
{83548}{83685} I have hit 13 deer in seven|weeks driving down this road!
{83693}{83778} And I HAVE to drive|down this road
{83778}{83893} every day, 40 miles to work and back.
{83893}{84010} I HAVE to drive to work|and I HAVE to drive home!
{84129}{84211} Where do they come from?
{84514}{84585} Oh...he's dead.
{84629}{84710} And I LOVE deer.
{87864}{87964} Well, they sure picked the right|place to practise a burn on.
{88284}{88378} That Rumelthanger place|was an eyesore.
{89474}{89534} What do you suppose...?
{89534}{89564} Is that a lawn mower?
{90335}{90404} Mister, you OK?
{90545}{90619} Jeez, mister, you're lucky|she didn't roll on you.
{90822}{90875} I guess the belt broke.
{90875}{90995} I wouldn't be surprised. You don't have|brakes on that trailer, right?
{91015}{91155} I worked for John Deere for 30 years, and I can tell|you shouldn't be hauling a rig behind a mower.
{91155}{91225} At least not down|a hill like that.
{91281}{91331} I'm Danny Riordan.
{91365}{91423}Alvin Straight.
{91424}{91554} Alvin, let's get you and this rig off the road|and see what the damage is.
{91865}{91908} Let's get this off the road.| Sure you're OK?
{92890}{92925} OK.
{92960}{93059} You OK? Everything all right?|I'm going back to the exercise.
{93060}{93115} Thanks. Appreciate it.
{93308}{93355} Well,...let's|take a look at this mower.
{93375}{93475}- This is what '65, '66?|- '66.
{93669}{93760} Well,...tell you right now, Alvin,| you won't be going anywhere tonight.
{93760}{93905} Aside from your, ah, drive belt being busted,|you got transmission problems.
{93905}{93991}- Where you headed?|- Mount Zion.
{93995}{94068} Mount Zion, Wisconsin?|Past Prairie du Chien?
{94069}{94174}- That's 60 more miles of hills.|- That's across the Mississippi.
{94178}{94275}- What's in Mount Zion, Alvin?|- My brother lives there.
{94275}{94387}- Why didn't you take your car?|- I'm not licensed.
{94388}{94485}- Couldn't he visit?|- He's had a bad stroke.
{94485}{94590}- Where are you coming from?|- Back a piece.
{94590}{94640} West Union?
{94672}{94726}-- Hawkeye?|- Nope.
{94740}{94829} Well, not New Hampton?|You haven't come that far.
{94840}{94920} You've come a long ways, haven't you?
{94920}{95015} Yeah, I have. Laurens, Iowa.
{95015}{95100}- Laurens?!|- That's west of The Grotto.
{95100}{95215}- How long have you been on the road?|- What's the date?
{95215}{95270} October eighth.
{95335}{95465} Five weeks. I left Laurens|on the fifth of September.
{95465}{95586}- You been bunkin' in that?|- That's my rollin' home.
{95586}{95702}- Where you been settin' up camp?|- In the fields. I pull off.
{95702}{95757} I don't travel at night.
{95757}{95895} Haven't you been scared, being alone?| There are weird people everywhere.
{95906}{95991} Well, ma'am, I fought|in the trenches in World War II.
{95991}{96098} Why should I be scared|of an Iowa cornfield?
{96117}{96228} Well, um... till we get|this mower fixed,...
{96252}{96416} why don't you...ah, bivouac in our yard here?|There's a bathroom in the garage you can use.
{96457}{96506} Well, that's|awful generous of you
{96523}{96581} and I'm sure my machine here|is agreeable to that too.
{96677}{96767} Sure wanna thank you folks|for helping me today.
{96767}{96907} There's a lot of rain forecast.|Sure don't want to get stuck in that trailer?
{96907}{97005} I...I do a little woodwork.|I thought you'd like a few fish.
{97006}{97085} My daughter does woodwork.|She makes birdhouses.
{97086}{97161} Oh, that's nice.
{97306}{97362}- You finished there?|- I believe I am.
{99532}{99607}- I'm in need of a phone.|- Sure. Come in.
{99607}{99709} I wanna call my daughter|about my recent travels.
{99710}{99737} Sure. Come in.
{99737}{99867} If it's all the same with you,|do you have a cordless phone?
{99867}{99981}- Door's wide open, come...|- I can call from out here.
{100202}{100237} Here you go.
{100237}{100382} You're welcome to sit in the kitchen.| We can leave, if you're lookin' for privacy.
{100382}{100507} Out here's fine.|Is the area code still 712 here?
{100507}{100597} No, Alvin.|That hill rolled you into 319.
{100598}{100687} You need to dial one|and your area code.
{100687}{100752}712, thank you.
{101102}{101167}-'Hello?'|- Rose?
{101167}{101251} Dad?...Dad...
{101252}{101343} Uh, I'm...so glad to hear you.
{101547}{101683} It's gonna cost him a bundle to fix that mower.| I don't think he's got that kinda money.
{101683}{101813} I wouldn't drive that thing to Excelsior.|It's a lawn mower, for God's sake.
{101833}{101948} Uh, your social security cheque?|Ah...it's here, Dad.
{101948}{102018} Rose, can you send me my cheque?
{102018}{102053} Uh, yeah.
{102063}{102198}He's damn lucky he made it down that hill.|- He could've died easily. - Yeah.
{102238}{102372} He's none too strong.| Did you see how he has to walk with the canes?
{102383}{102443} OK, OK, Dad, OK.
{102708}{102773} I...I have a pencil, Dad.
{102794}{102874} The hills just get worse|the closer you get to the Mississippi.
{102973}{103084} Go ahead and drive him, honey.| Mount Zion can't be half a day. It's fine.
{103126}{103190} You're a good man,|Danny Riordan.
{103198}{103300} And that's why I married you,|despite what my mother said.
{103393}{103488} I miss you, Dad.
{103501}{103582}- I love you, Rosie.|- I love you too, Dad.
{103600}{103650}-Uh, bye, Dad 
{103670}{103720}-Bye...Dad.
{104523}{104633}- What are you cookin' there, Alvin?|- Oh, I'm makin' my Mexican coffee.
{104633}{104753}- Ah. Mind if I join you?|- Get you a chair... that iron one there.
{104823}{104909} You'll be a guest|in your own back yard.
{105020}{105096} Amm, I talked to the Olsen|twins, and,
{105106}{105253} ah...they estimate it'll cost around 250 dollars|to get your mower fixed.
{105253}{105383} Well, that's twice what it oughta be,|I guess it's cos they're twins, huh?
{105446}{105561} I'd be happy to drive you the|rest of the way to Mount Zion.
{105562}{105623} Be a nice Sunday drive.
{105623}{105738} We enjoy crossin' the river,|especially now with the trees in colour.
{105738}{105880} Well, I appreciate that, but...|I wanna finish this one my own way.
{106165}{106223} Try this.
{106321}{106374} Thank you.
{106408}{106553} Well, you know, Alvin, there's a lotta hills|bigger than Clairmont's between here and Zion.
{106553}{106687} Even if you get that mower runnin' again,|it may still break down.
{106688}{106778} Well, you're a kind man|talkin' to a stubborn man.
{106778}{106867} I still wanna finish this|the way I started.
{107028}{107053} Hi, Verlyn.
{107078}{107103} How the heck you doin'?|- Fine.
{107153}{107178} Wonderful.
{107548}{107619} Well...they gave you|a plate of her brownies.
{107619}{107658} How's that for timing?
{107679}{107725} Janet makes the best brownies...
{107726}{107776}... in Lafayette county.
{107777}{107849} She won prizes every year|at the county fair.
{107859}{107889} Mmm...help yourself.|- Thank you.
{108064}{108189} Mmm...I've been doin' errands and I'm heading for a beer.|I thought you'd like to join me.
{108189}{108324} Well, I don't drink any more, but...|I'm always up for a change of scenery.
{108324}{108354} Well, come on.
{108579}{108639} Well, I'm ridin' a little higher|and a little faster.
{108639}{108720} Except when you came down|that hill.
{108933}{109027} I picked up a mournful taste|for liquor in France.
{109027}{109124} When I came back,|I couldn't drink enough of it.
{109124}{109179} I wasn't worth a stick|of stove wood...
{109214}{109258} I was mean.
{109309}{109436} A preacher helped me put some distance|between me and the bottle.
{109464}{109589} And he helped me see... the reason I was drinkin',|I was seein' all them things here,
{109589}{109662} that I'd seen over there.
{109922}{110013} Lots of men came back drinkin' hard.
{110089}{110159} Well...everyone|tryin' to forget.
{110174}{110239} I can see it|in a man right away.
{110314}{110364} Yup.
{110771}{110829} There was one time...
{110879}{110929}... when we just...
{110959}{111096}... Were waiting for|the first warm meal in ten days.
{111234}{111339} We...thought|we'd seen the worst.
{111354}{111453} We hadn't had|much trouble from the air.
{111523}{111579} I was on the rise...
{111604}{111736}... with the quartermaster,|workin' on more coffee for me and my buddies.
{111807}{111914} A stray Fokker|came over the treetops...
{111915}{112026} and dropped|an incendiary on the mess tent.
{112027}{112077} All my buddies...
{112149}{112263} The Kraut banked right in front|of me on that hill...
{112280}{112379} and now I can...|see the...Swastika.
{112674}{112772} That is one thing|that I can't shake loose...
{112773}{112873} All my buddies faces|are still young.
{112922}{113066} And the thing is, the more years|I have, the more they've lost.
{113111}{113240} And it's not always buddies faces that I see,|sometime they're German faces.
{113299}{113420} Near the end we were shootin'|moon-faced boys.
{113550}{113604} I was a sniper.
{113620}{113724} Where I grew up, you learned|how to shoot to hunt food.
{113735}{113884} They'd post me up front.|Darn near ahead of the lines.
{113910}{114004} And I'd sit...forever.
{114020}{114124} It's an amazing thing what you|can see while you're sittin'.
{114151}{114221} I'd look for the officers, the 
{114222}{114322} radio guys or artillery spotter.
{114337}{114455} Sometime I'd spot|a gun nest by the smoke 
{114455}{114510}... and I'd fire into it.
{114528}{114619}Sometime it was just|a movement in the woods.
{114750}{114810}We had a scout,
{114831}{114939}a little fella, name of Katz.
{114980}{115061}He was a Polish boy|from Milwaukee.
{115125}{115231}He'd always take recon|and he was darn good at it.
{115234}{115344}We went by his word and he saved|our skin many a time.
{115415}{115480}He was a little fella...
{115615}{115710}We'd broken|out of the hedgerows...
{115720}{115815}We were makin'|a run across the open
{115820}{115880}and we come upon a woods.
{115930}{116000}We started drawin' fire.
{116015}{116096}I took my usual position...
{116120}{116229}and I saw somethin' movin',|real slow like.
{116258}{116411}I waited ten minutes,|it moved again and I shot.
{116427}{116489}The movement stopped.
{116525}{116650}The next day|we found Katz...head shot.
{116677}{116768}He'd been workin'|his way back toward our lines.
{116815}{116951}Everyone in the unit thought|a German sniper had taken him...
{117000}{117085}Everyone, all these years.
{117105}{117163}Everyone but me.
{118569}{118649}See, Harald...brainiac...
{118688}{118779}Got the mower assembly free with|this here little old wrench...
{118780}{118880}You said it wouldn't work.|I'd say it worked pretty good.
{118885}{118920}Wouldn't you?
{119010}{119099}So help me slide her out.|We can get settled up.
{119796}{119907}Uh...I got parts and labour|that add up to $247.80.
{119996}{120146}Well, I'd say that's a little heavy for light work.|Don't you think?
{120156}{120313}I've got an old man's eyes,|but, ah... I'm noticin' some new tyre here.
{120314}{120455}Well, now...ah, we got those off a resell,|but the treads are good!
{120461}{120572}Well, friend, are you chargin'|me for good or for new?
{120631}{120689}Ahhhh...Thorvald?
{120701}{120801}Ahh...we can make|an adjustment there.
{120801}{120926}Well, I think the adjustment|should be about thirty dollars.
{120926}{120981}Is that what|your pencil's sayin'?
{120991}{121090}And, ah...about the labour...
{121101}{121219}I appreciate that you boys have|done some real time on this...
{121219}{121316}of course, a man's gotta ask|when he's workin' with twins -
{121317}{121381}especially a bickerin' pair -
{121406}{121491}-how much workin' was fightin'?|-He got that right.
{121492}{121546}Shut up, Danny.
{121547}{121661}If I was to judge by this joyous|affair I saw today,
{121661}{121751}I would calculate maybe 20|per cent taken off the labour.
{121771}{121825}Anything else, mister?
{121871}{121951}Well, I'm not from these parts,|but where I come from,
{121956}{122096}I would say that that was a|little rich for Iowa oil.
{122097}{122141}Take the oil, no charge.
{122141}{122261}Well, that's a splendid offer|and I do appreciate it.
{122281}{122326}What's the tally?
{122336}{122371}Ah...ahhh...
{122551}{122601}Hundred and eighty even?
{122601}{122636}Done.
{122681}{122807}Thanks to you boys, I'm gonna|get this rig back on the road.
{122808}{122968}I've drove it all the way across Iowa|and I'm hopin' it holds on till I get to Wisconsin.
{122968}{123072}My brother lives there.|I haven't seen him in ten years.
{123101}{123231}There's no one knows your life better|than a brother that's near your age.
{123231}{123351}He knows who and what you are|better than anyone on Earth.
{123366}{123511}My brother and I said some...|unforgivable things the last time we met,
{123551}{123631}but, I'm tryin' to put that behind me.
{123661}{123781}And this trip is a hard|swallow... of my pride,
{123804}{123887}I just hope I'm not too late.
{124080}{124149}A brother's a brother.
{124401}{124531}Well,... Guess I'll be turnin' in.
{124549}{124648}I'll, ah...see you in the|morning, then, before you go.
{124648}{124718}I'm gonna leave awful early.
{125177}{125283}I wanna thank you for your|kindness to a stranger.
{125295}{125382}It's been a genuine pleasure|havin' you here, Alvin.
{125382}{125442}Write to us, sometime.
{125442}{125495}I will.
{132361}{132437}I noticed your campfire.
{132438}{132544}I brought you some dinner...|Mashed potatoes, meat loaf.
{132545}{132630}Well, thank you kindly.|I've had my dinner, but...
{132630}{132716}-...would you join me for a while?|-Sure.
{132890}{132923}Thank you.
{133123}{133243}-I hope you don't mind me trespassin'.|-Oh, no, not at all.
{133243}{133408}Made a fine choice. You're camped next to|one of the oldest cemeteries in the Midwest.
{133408}{133461}French Catholic trappers.
{133462}{133559}-The Marquette party?|-Two of his men.
{133610}{133803}I couldn't help but notice|the rather unusual mode of transport.
{133804}{133896}Well, you're not the first|person to notice that, Padre.
{133923}{134003}My eyes are bad. I can't drive.
{134003}{134153}I don't like someone else drivin' the bus,|and I need to get to my brother's.
{134153}{134223}Fair enough. Where is he?
{134223}{134346}Well, he's so close, I can practically feel him.|Mount Zion.
{134358}{134454}-What's his name?|-Lyle Straight.
{134478}{134608}Is he that fella that came in|with a stroke some weeks ago?
{134608}{134671}Thats right. Do you know him?
{134678}{134793}I work at the hospital in Boscobel.|I remember him comin' in.
{134793}{134873}Caught my attention|because...he lives in my parish.
{134873}{134983}-Well, he's a Baptist.|-Oh, I believe he told me that.
{134993}{135088}Told me a few things,|matter of fact, but...
{135088}{135165}he didn't|mention having a brother.
{135197}{135312}Well, neither one of us has had|a brother for quite some time.
{135406}{135483}So, you saw him?|Is he all right?
{135483}{135624}I only saw him that once and|I haven't heard anything more.
{135921}{136048}Well, Lyle and I grew up|as close as brothers could be.
{136048}{136168}We were raised on a farm|in Moorhead, Minnesota.
{136173}{136232}We worked hard.
{136245}{136377}My mom and dad darn near killed themselves|tryin' to make that farm work.
{136398}{136507}And me and Lyle would|make games out of our chores.
{136528}{136628}We'd dream up somethin'|about racin' and wagerin'
{136628}{136758}do anything to keep our mind off the cold.|Lord, it was cold.
{136773}{136863}He and I used|to sleep out in the yard
{136863}{136938}every summer night,|if it wasn't pourin'.
{136938}{137033}Nine months of winter,|we couldn't get enough summer.
{137055}{137179}We'd bunk down|when the sun went down.
{137179}{137253}We'd talk to each other|until we went to sleep.
{137258}{137352}We'd talk about the stars...
{137353}{137489}...and whether there might be|somebody else like us out in space,...
{137489}{137555}...places we wanted to go and...
{137559}{137647}it made our trials seem smaller.
{137684}{137787}Yeah, we pretty much talked|each other through growin' up.
{137933}{138033}Oh, whatever happened|between you two?
{138090}{138204}Story as old as the Bible.|Cain and Abel.
{138224}{138302}Anger, vanity.
{138339}{138424}You mix that together|with liquor, and...
{138424}{138541}you've got two brothers who|haven't spoken in ten years.
{138594}{138720}Well, whatever it was|that made me and Lyle so mad...
{138759}{138826}don't matter any more.
{138834}{138973}I wanna make peace.|I wanna sit with him,
{138984}{139094}look up at the stars... like we used to do
{139124}{139180}so long ago.
{139384}{139441}I say ''Amen'' to that.
{140819}{140877}Howdy.
{141294}{141419}I haven't had a drink in a lot of years.|Now I'm gonna have me a cold beer.
{141419}{141464}What flavour?
{141464}{141534}What does|a Miller's Lite taste like?
{141799}{141834}There you go.
{141944}{142024}-How's it taste?|- It's good.
{142024}{142095}-Keep the change.|- Thank you.
{142130}{142244}It's an interesting rig you got|outside. Get up the hill OK?
{142244}{142334}That hill and 200 more|just like it.
{142334}{142419}- How far did ya come?|- From Iowa.
{142420}{142474} I'm headed|for Lyle Straight's place.
{142474}{142599} Iowa! My God,|you must be thirsty.
{143681}{143769}- Another beer?|- This will do me fine.
{143769}{143910}I wonder could you point me to Lyle's place?| I haven't seen him in an awful long time.
{143934}{144046}Well, you just...ah,|cross 61 here, on ''W'',
{144046}{144156} Take ''W'' on down to Weed Road|and then on to Remington Road.
{144156}{144233}On your right|will be Lyle's place.
{144254}{144310}If he's there that is.
{147706}{147796}-How you doin'...?|-Not too good.
{147876}{147941}This thing's just tired.
{148056}{148126}Is there anything|I can do to help you?
{148146}{148276}-Well, I don't know. It just quit on me.|-Why don't you try her again?
{148396}{148436}I'm headin' to Lyle Straight's place.
{151466}{151516}Lyle!
{151612}{151666}Lyle!
{151879}{151929} Alvin?
{152887}{152948} Sit down, Alvin.
{154162}{154263} Did you ride that thing all|the way out here to see me?
{154322}{154387} I did, Lyle.
