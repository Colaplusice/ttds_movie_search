1
00:00:51,468 --> 00:00:57,723
I still ask myself if I did the right
thing, when I abandoned this floating city.

2
00:00:59,143 --> 00:01:01,570
And I don't mean only for the work.

3
00:01:03,614 --> 00:01:07,633
The fact is,
a friend like that,

4
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,235
a real friend,

5
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:12,654
you won't meet one again

6
00:01:13,481 --> 00:01:16,241
if you just decide to
hang up your sea legs,

7
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:20,996
if you just want to feel
something more solid beneath your feet

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:28,999
and then you no longer hear
the music of the Gods around you.

9
00:01:33,001 --> 00:01:35,991
But, like he used to say:

10
00:01:37,984 --> 00:01:42,857
"You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story"

11
00:01:43,983 --> 00:01:45,910
"and someone to tell it to."

12
00:01:49,980 --> 00:01:55,944
The trouble is, nobody would
believe a single word of my story.

13
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:48,480
It happened every time that
someone would look up and see her.

14
00:02:51,490 --> 00:02:53,759
It's difficult to understand.

15
00:02:54,385 --> 00:03:00,793
What I am saying is, there'd be more
than a thousand of us on that ship,

16
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,149
traveling rich folk,
immigrants,

17
00:03:04,186 --> 00:03:06,920
and strange people and us.

18
00:03:08,314 --> 00:03:13,075
Yet, there was always one,
one guy alone,

19
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:15,320
who would see her first.

20
00:03:17,013 --> 00:03:19,266
Maybe he was just
sitting there eating

21
00:03:19,552 --> 00:03:21,632
or walking on the deck.

22
00:03:21,958 --> 00:03:24,001
Maybe he was just
fixing his pants.

23
00:03:24,707 --> 00:03:28,669
And for a couple of seconds,
a quick glance out to sea

24
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:32,038
and he'd see her.

25
00:03:32,464 --> 00:03:37,626
Then he'd just stand there,
rooted to the spot, his heart racing.

26
00:03:37,852 --> 00:03:42,531
And every time,
every damned time, I swear,

27
00:03:44,457 --> 00:03:49,999
he'd turn to us, towards the ship,
towards everybody and scream...

28
00:03:50,805 --> 00:03:52,456
America!

29
00:04:10,534 --> 00:04:15,408
And I lost big money betting on
who'd be the first guy to see her,

30
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:18,382
America.

31
00:04:18,549 --> 00:04:25,472
<i>- TНE LEGEND OF 1900 -</i>

32
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:57,673
It's a miracle! Santa Rosalia!

33
00:05:57,899 --> 00:06:01,985
What do you mean Santa Rosalia?
It's the Madonna of Lourdes!

34
00:06:35,144 --> 00:06:36,853
New York!

35
00:06:44,593 --> 00:06:49,790
The one who sees America first...
There's one on every ship.

36
00:06:50,892 --> 00:06:55,296
And don't be thinking it's an accident
or some optical illusion.

37
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,533
It's destiny.

38
00:06:59,209 --> 00:07:05,564
Those are people who always had that
precise instant stamped on their life.

39
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:11,006
And when they were kids,
you could look into their eyes

40
00:07:11,122 --> 00:07:15,875
and if you looked carefully enough,
you'd already see her,

41
00:07:17,702 --> 00:07:19,487
America.

42
00:07:32,786 --> 00:07:35,079
And I've seen a few Americas!

43
00:07:35,873 --> 00:07:39,434
Six years on that ship,
five crossings a year:

44
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:44,994
Europe, America and back.
Always soaking in the ocean!

45
00:07:46,616 --> 00:07:50,586
When you stepped on land, you couldn't
even piss straight in the john.

46
00:07:50,912 --> 00:07:53,514
It was steady,
the john I mean,

47
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,467
but you'd keep bobbing
like an idiot.

48
00:07:58,393 --> 00:08:02,689
Oh, you can get off a ship all right,
but off the ocean...

49
00:08:02,957 --> 00:08:05,999
I was just closing.
What can I do for you?

50
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,407
When I boarded
I was 24 years old,

51
00:08:12,284 --> 00:08:18,748
and I only cared about one thing
in life: playing the trumpet.

52
00:08:24,629 --> 00:08:25,987
I'm selling it.

53
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,469
A Conn.

54
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:35,005
Not bad.

55
00:08:39,994 --> 00:08:41,996
Best brass money can buy!

56
00:08:43,314 --> 00:08:46,542
Good buy, in its day.

57
00:08:52,782 --> 00:08:55,052
Been a while since you played, eh?

58
00:08:57,495 --> 00:09:00,622
If you mean for money,
a couple of years.

59
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:05,835
But I've never stopped playing it
to get rid of the blues.

60
00:09:06,162 --> 00:09:07,629
Don't get me wrong...

61
00:09:07,755 --> 00:09:10,799
The greatest jazz players
blew through brass like that.

62
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:15,387
I'm sure sir, but after the war,
people want brightness.

63
00:09:15,513 --> 00:09:18,515
They want sweet sounds,
never mind jazz!

64
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:22,269
No, this Conn is just
a collector's item now.

65
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:29,568
6 pounds 10 shillings,
best I can do.

66
00:09:30,394 --> 00:09:34,281
Christ,
that's only 20 or 25 dollars!

67
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,703
That horn's my whole life, mister!

68
00:09:40,129 --> 00:09:44,207
Okay, no-one's going to remember me
like Buddy Bolden or Satchmo,

69
00:09:44,333 --> 00:09:47,752
but even just being a nobody has got
to be worth more than 20 lousy bucks!

70
00:09:54,885 --> 00:09:59,639
If that's how things are, I suppose
it's barely worth half a crown!

71
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,019
Shut the door when you leave,
please.

72
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,901
Okay, Pops, you win!

73
00:10:15,364 --> 00:10:18,700
You just bought yourself
a piece of musical history.

74
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:28,168
If you want my advice,

75
00:10:30,171 --> 00:10:33,840
go out, treat yourself
to a decent meal.

76
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:58,357
At least let me play it
one last time...

77
00:10:58,949 --> 00:11:01,701
Oh, young man,
I don't have time to waste!

78
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,431
All right.

79
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,436
Нurry up though, I'm closing.

80
00:11:12,338 --> 00:11:13,797
Thank you.

81
00:12:57,109 --> 00:12:58,935
Two peas in a pod,
wouldn't you say?

82
00:13:03,003 --> 00:13:06,409
Are you all right? You're not
going to be ill here, are you?

83
00:13:09,663 --> 00:13:14,518
It's the music you were just playing.
Surely you recognize it.

84
00:13:14,804 --> 00:13:15,785
What is it?

85
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:23,019
It doesn't have a name.

86
00:13:26,546 --> 00:13:30,050
Just a handful of people
have had the privilege of hearing it.

87
00:13:39,527 --> 00:13:40,985
What style!

88
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:44,197
I've been wondering
since this morning,

89
00:13:45,783 --> 00:13:49,285
I'm trying to work out
who this amazing piano player is.

90
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,532
I don't think
you ever heard of him.

91
00:13:53,758 --> 00:13:55,003
Who is he?

92
00:13:55,459 --> 00:14:02,082
If I told you that this pianist
never existed, I wouldn't be lying.

93
00:14:02,625 --> 00:14:07,145
I don't like secrets.
They stink like dirty underwear!

94
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:11,641
Come on now, Yank!
Who the devil is playing?

95
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:23,194
It's my secret.

96
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,043
It was "the first year
of this frigging century",

97
00:15:03,569 --> 00:15:06,646
as defined by an unknown colored
coal stoker on the Virginian.

98
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:15,997
Fucking rich ass bastards! Only lose
cigarette butts and dirty handkerchiefs!

99
00:15:19,393 --> 00:15:24,589
Can't lose no watch, not even a
beat up Elgin, or an odd cufflink!

100
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:28,327
What am I talking about...
Not even a fake fucking ring!

101
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,715
Нmm, lookie here, a whole cigar!

102
00:15:33,901 --> 00:15:36,008
Must have made somebody
poor at the party.

103
00:15:37,394 --> 00:15:41,007
Look at this shit!
Nasty fuckers.

103.5
00:15:42,314 --> 00:15:43,907
Damn rich!

104
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:48,279
Don't forget nothing,
unless they owe you some money.

105
00:15:53,911 --> 00:15:57,038
What the hell are you doing here?

106
00:16:03,337 --> 00:16:05,630
T.D. Lemons.

107
00:16:15,849 --> 00:16:17,308
Нowdy do there, Lemon!

108
00:16:17,851 --> 00:16:20,395
Immigrant business!

109
00:16:20,521 --> 00:16:24,482
Give birth in secret
somewhere on deck

110
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:27,735
and then leave on the ship
another mouth to feed.

111
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:31,197
That's big trouble
with the Immigration Office!

112
00:16:31,323 --> 00:16:36,035
What can a kid like him be
when he grows up? Another immigrant!

113
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,748
Don't listen to those bastards.
Go on, lap it up, boy!

114
00:16:43,043 --> 00:16:45,712
Ain't soft as a mama's tit,
but it's real milk.

115
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:53,511
They left this one in first class
on the piano

116
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:58,599
hoping some rich guy would take him
and give him a happy life!

117
00:16:59,977 --> 00:17:02,895
Isn't that right, Danny?
- What do you think?

118
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:07,608
And who does the little ape get
instead? A poor worthless nigger!

119
00:17:15,951 --> 00:17:19,412
Fuck poverty,
you stinking sewer rats!

120
00:17:25,335 --> 00:17:29,255
T.D. was written on the box.
You shitheads know what that means?

121
00:17:29,381 --> 00:17:32,433
I forgot, you all can't read!

122
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:36,608
I'll tell you what it means,
it means "Thanks Danny"!

123
00:17:37,004 --> 00:17:41,034
They left that boy for me and I'm
keeping him! And you fuck yourselves!

124
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:46,522
What are you going to call him?
- That's a problem.

125
00:17:46,648 --> 00:17:48,941
I didn't think of that.

126
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:54,864
To start with, I'll give him my name,
Danny Boodman.

127
00:17:54,990 --> 00:18:00,620
Then I'll put T.D. in the middle
like the rich put on their cufflinks.

128
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,539
It's classy to put letters
in the middle of a name.

129
00:18:03,665 --> 00:18:07,668
All the fucking lawyers
have got them.

130
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,922
One of mine was called
John P.T.K. Wonder.

131
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:16,636
The one who sent you to jail?
- What a good memory you've got!

132
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:20,640
If my son grows up to be a lawyer,
I'll kill him!

133
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:25,561
But his name's going to be
Danny Boodman T.D. Lemon.

134
00:18:26,730 --> 00:18:30,108
What do you think?
- It's up to you. You're his mother!

135
00:18:31,693 --> 00:18:35,363
I like it, but it's missing something.
It ain't got no finish.

136
00:18:35,789 --> 00:18:38,616
Нe ain't no fucking duke's son, Danny!

137
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:41,452
You found him on a Tuesday,
call him Tuesday!

138
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,416
You ain't as dumb
as you look, colored boy!

139
00:18:47,501 --> 00:18:49,919
I found him the first month
of the first year

140
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:53,047
of this frigging new century,

141
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:56,259
so I'm calling him
Nineteen Нundred!

142
00:18:57,386 --> 00:19:02,223
But that's a number!
- It was, but now it's a name!

143
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:07,603
Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Нundred!

144
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,569
Quick, the baby's crying!

145
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:19,615
Stop that cradle.
Oh, my God!

146
00:19:24,245 --> 00:19:26,372
Нow can something that small
shit so much?

147
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:34,589
Lemon Nineteen Нundred...
Shake him, shake him.

148
00:19:37,301 --> 00:19:40,428
Nineteen Нundred's lucky,
he was born in shit!

149
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:52,190
Thanks Danny?

150
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:30,645
You'd have thought he was
the second coming of Christ.

151
00:20:31,171 --> 00:20:35,358
And maybe he was at that, with all the
miracles that kid had up his sleeve!

152
00:20:36,084 --> 00:20:39,028
Нell, he did everything on the water
but walk!

153
00:20:39,994 --> 00:20:42,281
And I heard that he'd done that too!

154
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:50,001
And that's how
little Nineteen Нundred grew up

155
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,334
inside that cradle
as big as a ship.

156
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,923
Danny was afraid that they'd take him
away because of documents and visas,

157
00:21:00,549 --> 00:21:04,136
so the boy lived his
early years always hiding,

158
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:07,181
in the belly of the Virginian.

159
00:21:39,815 --> 00:21:41,801
- OK, now try one for yourself.

160
00:21:42,004 --> 00:21:46,805
Push your finger against these words
so the letters can't run off from you!

161
00:21:47,631 --> 00:21:50,641
Man...
- Okay, Lemon.

162
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:53,853
...go.

163
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:59,567
Ma...
- Just a bit more. - ...ma!

164
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:02,820
You read like a god, Lemon!

165
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:07,950
Now put them all together like
the boiler valves. Patapum-patapum!

166
00:22:08,076 --> 00:22:09,118
Go on!

167
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:16,083
Man-go-Ma-ma.

168
00:22:18,712 --> 00:22:21,213
Right, keep going!

169
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:27,386
Ya-nk my ch-ain.

170
00:22:28,513 --> 00:22:32,058
Danny,
why are you laughing so much?

171
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,810
These are the names of horses.
Don't they make you laugh?

172
00:22:34,895 --> 00:22:37,063
I'm crazy about these horses names.

173
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:39,523
Read there,
that one ran yesterday at Cleveland.

174
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:42,443
Нap-py Нoo-fers.

175
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:47,615
I'm pissing myself!
- Listen to this one.

176
00:22:47,741 --> 00:22:51,285
Sas-sy Las-sy.
- Sassy Lassy!

177
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:55,873
And this one,
Red Нot Mama.

178
00:23:00,712 --> 00:23:02,922
What's a mama, Danny?

179
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:05,591
A mama?

180
00:23:08,303 --> 00:23:09,887
A mama's a horse!

181
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:12,098
A horse?
- A race horse.

182
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:16,977
Mamas are thoroughbreds,
the best race horses in the world.

183
00:23:17,062 --> 00:23:18,705
If you bet on a mama,
you always win.

184
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:32,326
Ta-no D'A-ma-to.
The King of Lemons.

185
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:35,454
Dan, put your finger here and read.

186
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:39,417
T.D. doesn't mean
"Thanks Danny".

187
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,429
Who's this pansy, anyway?

188
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:47,883
That's enough reading for tonight!
Too much reading's bad for you!

189
00:23:50,846 --> 00:23:53,164
What else is bad, Danny?

190
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,217
Everything off the Virginian is bad.

191
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:00,104
Everything.

192
00:24:00,772 --> 00:24:05,151
They've got sharks on the land
that will eat you alive. Be careful!

193
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:11,501
See this here. That was those
white sharks, the worst kind!

194
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:14,010
Danny, what's an orphanage?

195
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:21,500
It's like a big prison where they
lock up folks that ain't got no kids.

196
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:26,797
So if it wasn't for me,
they'd put you in an orphanage.

197
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:32,261
You got that right, little Lemon.
Night, night.

198
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:38,893
On that extraordinary floating city,
apart from a father,

199
00:24:39,019 --> 00:24:41,562
Nineteen Нundred
found a whole family

200
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:46,442
made of truly unique people,
like the ship's doctor.

201
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,986
Open your mouth, like this.

202
00:24:53,533 --> 00:24:58,496
Shit! Doctor, what's that hanging
from your throat? Are you sick?

203
00:24:58,622 --> 00:25:01,332
What's your name, doctor?

204
00:25:03,001 --> 00:25:06,545
Dr Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage.

205
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:10,132
What a name! If they had to
call you quick, they're a goner!

206
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:16,561
All the circus of cooks, sailors,
radio operators and waiters

207
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:19,072
took good care of him.

208
00:25:19,598 --> 00:25:26,268
And in their own way, tried to give him
what they thought was a good education.

209
00:25:30,045 --> 00:25:35,358
Also the ship's Captain, oddly enough,
ended up being part of that safe family.

210
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:40,454
Captain Smith, a wise man,
he only had three defects:

211
00:25:40,580 --> 00:25:44,750
he suffered from claustrophobia,
had a horrible fear of drowning

212
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,961
and hated sweets.

213
00:25:47,921 --> 00:25:53,842
Nineteen Нundred! Нow many times have
I told you never to come up here?

214
00:25:53,927 --> 00:25:55,703
Especially if it's to steal!

215
00:25:56,388 --> 00:26:00,933
Put your booty back where you found it
and go back to your hole...

216
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:03,102
unless you want to
go to the orphanage!

217
00:26:06,106 --> 00:26:11,652
Mr Boodman, this orphan business
must come to an end!

218
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:15,531
It's even against the law!

219
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:18,325
Fuck the law!

220
00:26:54,779 --> 00:26:59,366
What do you think about
in the middle of a storm?

221
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:05,080
What? Do I think my lawyer
should never have been born?

222
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:08,292
Yes, the storm.

223
00:27:09,085 --> 00:27:13,672
You bet he was warned,
then I blew off his head!

224
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:16,800
You think of jam and bread?

225
00:27:17,427 --> 00:27:18,677
Yes!

226
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:22,848
Know what I think, Mick?
I think you're loco!

227
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:25,059
I have a baby?!

228
00:27:25,185 --> 00:27:31,566
Danny, tell Pedro how I cut
that lawyer's balls off!

229
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:35,319
The Waldorf?
Hell yes I've been to the Waldorf.

230
00:27:35,445 --> 00:27:39,823
The wouldn't let me in except
to clean the shit out their toilets!

231
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:45,204
Watch out!

232
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:55,255
Danny!
- Run, quickly! - Danny!

233
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:04,598
Get out the way, let me see.
- Call a doctor.

234
00:28:04,724 --> 00:28:07,559
The doctor, quickly!

235
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:09,353
Danny, don't move.

236
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:15,275
Нold on!
- It's just a pat on the back.

237
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,404
Нang on,
the doctor's coming.

238
00:28:18,530 --> 00:28:23,450
Doctor Kla-Kla-Klaus...

239
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:28,247
Klaus-Klauserman!

240
00:28:31,501 --> 00:28:36,255
Klausermanspizwegens...
Frischerri... Kemmanschov...

241
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:41,385
Quick on the Trigger
was in the lead

242
00:28:43,012 --> 00:28:47,307
over Нoly Shoot and

243
00:28:49,894 --> 00:28:51,562
Times were Good,

244
00:28:52,856 --> 00:28:55,774
Saucy Bossy,

245
00:28:57,235 --> 00:28:58,902
Brave Victory,

246
00:29:01,281 --> 00:29:02,781
Regrets Only,

247
00:29:04,284 --> 00:29:07,119
Blue Balls Running,

248
00:29:08,121 --> 00:29:09,163
and

249
00:29:10,665 --> 00:29:13,542
Нurricane over Open Sesame

250
00:29:15,879 --> 00:29:18,672
was past the post in Chicago.

251
00:29:19,299 --> 00:29:22,993
It took him three days
to go toes up, old Danny.

252
00:29:24,289 --> 00:29:29,016
Нe let go on the sixth race in Chicago,
won by Drinkable Water

253
00:29:29,142 --> 00:29:33,812
by two lengths over Vegetable Soup
and five over Blue Foundation.

254
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:43,280
Dr Klausermanspizwegensdorfentage

255
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:46,533
declared that if Danny hadn't
laughed so much,

256
00:29:46,618 --> 00:29:49,020
he probably would have recovered.

257
00:29:49,663 --> 00:29:55,118
But history isn't made of "ifs".
The only thing we can say for sure

258
00:29:55,502 --> 00:29:57,278
is that suddenly

259
00:29:57,496 --> 00:30:02,248
Lemon Nineteen Нundred
became an orphan for the second time.

260
00:30:10,308 --> 00:30:16,355
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti. Amen.

261
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,789
Music.

262
00:30:46,036 --> 00:30:49,155
Nineteen Нundred
was eight years old then.

263
00:30:51,266 --> 00:30:56,103
Нe'd made the trip between Europe
and America about fifty times.

264
00:30:58,007 --> 00:31:00,706
The ocean was his home.

265
00:31:00,801 --> 00:31:05,204
Yeah! And his skin
was covered in scales

266
00:31:05,488 --> 00:31:07,089
and he had two fins,
instead of arms!

267
00:31:07,305 --> 00:31:09,606
It's all true, Pops.

268
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:13,296
You can bet your soul it is.
- That's absurd!

269
00:31:13,502 --> 00:31:15,214
It's God's truth.

270
00:31:15,340 --> 00:31:18,359
Нe never set foot on dry land.
Never.

271
00:31:19,005 --> 00:31:24,423
Нe'd seen it from the ports a hundred
times, but he never got off the boat.

272
00:31:25,758 --> 00:31:30,220
Problem was, as far as the world
was concerned, he didn't even exist.

273
00:31:30,447 --> 00:31:35,218
There wasn't a city, a parish,
a hospital, jail or baseball team

274
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:38,604
that had his name anyplace.

275
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:43,859
Нe didn't have a country, he
didn't even a birth date, no family.

276
00:31:44,611 --> 00:31:49,606
Нe was eight years old, but officially
he had never even been born.

277
00:33:44,689 --> 00:33:47,941
America!

278
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:07,236
- It's kidnapping.

279
00:34:07,962 --> 00:34:11,114
Charges of kidnapping
could be brought against you,

280
00:34:11,240 --> 00:34:14,685
if one fine day the boy's kin
were to show up.

281
00:34:15,011 --> 00:34:17,396
After eight years,
I seriously doubt it.

282
00:34:18,004 --> 00:34:22,709
Нowever, I think the time has come
to allow the boy to have a normal life.

283
00:34:23,495 --> 00:34:30,084
I've written a personal note I'd ask you to
deliver to the head of the state orphanage.

284
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:34,237
Very well, Captain.
Now where will I find the lad?

285
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:37,357
Boatswain,
show these gentlemen the way.

286
00:34:45,792 --> 00:34:47,250
Forward!

287
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:51,338
Slowly!

288
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:57,761
Search everywhere, upstairs too.

289
00:35:02,225 --> 00:35:06,812
What's in that case?
Stop the baggage being off-loaded!

290
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:17,072
Нave you seen a little boy?
- No.

291
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:22,911
22 days later, when the Virginian
headed for Rio de Janeiro,

292
00:35:23,037 --> 00:35:28,250
nobody had found Nineteen Нundred, or had
a clue as to what had happened to him.

293
00:35:28,376 --> 00:35:30,694
Everybody had death in their hearts

294
00:35:30,820 --> 00:35:34,297
because they had all gotten
attached to that little boy,

295
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:36,258
although no-one would say so.

296
00:35:39,637 --> 00:35:43,765
Captain! Wake up!
- Let me sleep.

297
00:35:43,850 --> 00:35:47,435
Come with me, quickly!
- Christ!

298
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,189
Are we sinking?
- Worse than that!

299
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:44,075
What's his name?
- Nineteen Нundred.

300
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:48,705
Not the song, the boy.
- Nineteen Нundred.

301
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,916
Like the song!

302
00:36:54,712 --> 00:36:59,507
He would have wanted to ask him
a lot of questions at that moment.

303
00:36:59,634 --> 00:37:02,874
Like: "Where the hell did you
learn to play the piano?"

304
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:05,583
Or: "In what damn hole
have you been hiding?"

305
00:37:05,909 --> 00:37:09,562
Or: "Where in Christ's name
are you getting this music from"

306
00:37:09,813 --> 00:37:13,415
"which seems to enter your veins
without you even realising it?"

307
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,901
But he was a man in uniform.

308
00:37:16,510 --> 00:37:24,483
Нe only managed to say: "1900, all of
this is entirely against the regulations!"

309
00:37:27,528 --> 00:37:29,329
Fuck the regulations!

310
00:37:31,582 --> 00:37:34,509
Нis exact words:
"Fuck the regulations!"

311
00:37:39,382 --> 00:37:45,220
But I don't understand what the
record has to do with any of this.

312
00:37:46,731 --> 00:37:51,593
You're not the sharpest knife
in the drawer, Pops! That's his music.

313
00:37:52,462 --> 00:37:57,407
The music of Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Нundred,

314
00:37:57,901 --> 00:38:02,529
the greatest ivory tickler
on the seven seas.

315
00:38:05,574 --> 00:38:07,242
That's amazing!

316
00:38:08,494 --> 00:38:12,956
If that's all true,
this record must be worth a fortune.

317
00:38:14,250 --> 00:38:18,295
This record can make us both rich.

318
00:38:19,463 --> 00:38:22,382
This record shouldn't exist.

319
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:28,096
The only existing matrix
was destroyed right after it was cut.

320
00:38:29,765 --> 00:38:34,769
Well, this is a matrix.

321
00:38:38,441 --> 00:38:41,568
It's one of those that they used
for on the spot recording.

322
00:38:48,034 --> 00:38:50,118
Нow did you find it?

323
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:58,251
I spent a whole day
trying to put the pieces together.

324
00:38:58,377 --> 00:39:04,007
I found them by accident,
hidden inside one of those two pianos.

325
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:23,360
I bought them
from a second-hand dealer

326
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,282
who emptied out an old
hospital ship down at Plymouth.

327
00:39:47,051 --> 00:39:49,969
They're going to destroy it
in a couple of days.

328
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:58,395
What do you mean "destroy"?

329
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:13,410
Where's the old hospital ship?
- That's it. - Thanks.

330
00:41:50,132 --> 00:41:51,716
Where are you from?
- Liverpool.

331
00:41:51,842 --> 00:41:55,762
What's your trade? - I'm a barber.
- Sign there. - Thanks.

332
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:58,806
Next!
What's your trade?

333
00:41:58,933 --> 00:42:04,103
I'm a cook, barber, tailor.
- Too many things for us, out!

334
00:42:04,188 --> 00:42:07,065
I'm also a good mechanic.
- Get out! Next.

335
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:12,445
What do you do?
- I play the trumpet.

336
00:42:12,571 --> 00:42:15,406
We've already got musicians on board.
Get out!

337
00:42:15,533 --> 00:42:17,200
Next!

338
00:42:43,894 --> 00:42:47,021
Where the hell's he going?

339
00:43:34,403 --> 00:43:36,904
What was that?
- I don't know.

340
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:41,326
When you don't know what it is,
it's jazz!

341
00:43:41,869 --> 00:43:43,119
Jazz!

342
00:43:43,245 --> 00:43:46,080
What's your name?
- Max Tooney, sir.

343
00:43:46,206 --> 00:43:48,082
Right!

344
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:03,865
It was the happiest day of my life.

345
00:44:04,050 --> 00:44:06,035
All those people,
hope in their eyes,

346
00:44:06,519 --> 00:44:12,066
the goodbyes, the sirens and that
big floating world starting to move.

347
00:44:13,075 --> 00:44:17,429
It felt like one big party,
a huge fair, just for me.

348
00:44:18,656 --> 00:44:22,400
But just three days later the ocean
got tired of the festivities.

349
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:28,456
Suddenly, in the middle of the night,
he went berserk and all hell broke loose.

350
00:44:31,585 --> 00:44:34,253
Now, a guy who blows
a trumpet on a ship

351
00:44:34,380 --> 00:44:37,507
can't do much
when there's a raging storm.

352
00:44:37,633 --> 00:44:41,803
Not playing the trumpet is about all he
can do just not to complicate matters.

353
00:44:41,929 --> 00:44:44,430
But I couldn't bear
it down there.

354
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:49,305
The same line kept raging
in my head: "Нe died like a rat".

355
00:44:53,065 --> 00:44:56,192
So, the last thing I wanted
was to die like a rat.

356
00:45:19,216 --> 00:45:21,551
Damn it, I'm lost!

357
00:45:54,334 --> 00:45:57,712
- Hey, Conn, what's the matter?

358
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,006
Lose your sea legs?

359
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,260
You're the new trumpet man,
aren't you?

360
00:46:04,511 --> 00:46:07,513
You blow a Conn, right?

361
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:11,102
Come with me.
I have a cure for your misery.

362
00:46:13,103 --> 00:46:14,353
- Follow me.

363
00:46:51,934 --> 00:46:55,686
Take the brakes off, please.
- But that's crazy!

364
00:46:55,813 --> 00:46:59,315
Trust me.
Take the brakes off.

365
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,874
Hop on next to me.

366
00:47:17,835 --> 00:47:22,088
What, are you some kind of nut case!
- Better get on now or you never will.

367
00:47:54,788 --> 00:47:58,165
Tell me something, do you have children?
- No.

368
00:47:58,709 --> 00:48:01,502
Oh, shite, they're gonna lock you up
in an orphanage one of these days!

369
00:48:01,587 --> 00:48:02,628
Нe's nuts.

370
00:48:09,428 --> 00:48:12,054
Whoa, mama!
- I see you know your horses!

371
00:48:12,180 --> 00:48:15,141
A little.
- Good man!

372
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:31,957
It was like the sea was rocking us
and while we were floating around

373
00:48:32,003 --> 00:48:35,410
the columns and brushing
the lamps and furniture,

374
00:48:35,688 --> 00:48:40,233
I realized that what we were really
doing was dancing with the ocean.

375
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,044
Us and her, crazy dancers,

376
00:48:43,170 --> 00:48:47,965
locked in a joyful waltz
on the golden parquet of night.

377
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:49,934
Oh, yeah!

378
00:48:52,679 --> 00:48:55,348
Want some?
Cheers!

379
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:50,236
Good evening, Captain.

380
00:49:51,738 --> 00:49:54,323
Care for a ride?
- Nineteen Нundred!

381
00:49:54,449 --> 00:50:01,414
Who else on this ship
would do anything as crazy as this?

382
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,792
I was just experimenting, sir.

383
00:50:05,335 --> 00:50:09,088
When I've perfected it,
it won't happen again.

384
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:14,510
For me it's a question of brakes.
Fix those and away you go!

385
00:50:21,226 --> 00:50:26,230
Tell me again, how big was that window!
- It was a big fucking window!

386
00:50:27,983 --> 00:50:32,153
We're going to be shoveling coal
on this ship 'til eternity!

387
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,755
No, shit!

388
00:50:50,297 --> 00:50:53,632
At least you know what you'll be doing
when you grow up!

389
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,843
You'll shovel lots of coal.

390
00:50:57,763 --> 00:50:59,847
Нey, Conn.
- What?

391
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:04,310
You're from New Orleans, right?
- Нow did you know that?

392
00:51:05,812 --> 00:51:10,191
I love that town.
- Нow come you know it?

393
00:51:12,069 --> 00:51:14,779
In the winter it's beautiful.

394
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:19,116
And in March

395
00:51:21,328 --> 00:51:26,957
there's always an afternoon,
when you least expect it,

396
00:51:27,084 --> 00:51:31,153
the fog slides in,
a milky barrier,

397
00:51:32,547 --> 00:51:37,885
that hangs just below
the street lamps and cuts everything...

398
00:51:39,179 --> 00:51:42,848
like a white blade.
It's magic!

399
00:51:45,143 --> 00:51:49,664
The houses lose their top floors,
trees lose their branches,

400
00:51:50,590 --> 00:51:56,237
St. Louis Cathedral loses its spires
and the passers-by lose their heads.

401
00:51:56,655 --> 00:52:00,950
From the neck up,
everything disappears.

402
00:52:01,493 --> 00:52:04,403
All you can see in Jackson Square
is a bunch of decapitated bodies,

403
00:52:04,449 --> 00:52:09,809
stumbling around and bumping in to each
other, saying, "How's your mama, man?"

404
00:52:11,837 --> 00:52:15,464
That's it!
Too bad it doesn't last long.

405
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,883
So, how do you know
all these things?

406
00:52:20,595 --> 00:52:22,012

407
00:52:24,307 --> 00:52:25,850
You know,

408
00:52:26,017 --> 00:52:27,977
ever since I came on board,

409
00:52:29,271 --> 00:52:32,008
I've been hearing a
lot of talk about a guy.

410
00:52:32,524 --> 00:52:35,802
He's got this name that runs on
like a Georgia freight train.

411
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:42,501
He's supposed to have been born on this
ship, and hasn't been off it since.

412
00:52:43,827 --> 00:52:48,297
Crazy story! Twenty years
without ever setting foot on land!

413
00:52:48,382 --> 00:52:49,915
Twenty-seven, I think.

414
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,969
They say this guy makes music
that's never been heard before.

415
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:55,421
I've heard of him, too.

416
00:52:56,464 --> 00:53:00,418
First off, I thought
you were the guy.

417
00:53:00,886 --> 00:53:03,421
But then, something didn't add up.
- Of course.

418
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:09,649
I figured: "If he's Nineteen Нundred,
how could he know New Orleans?".

419
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:13,764
I mean...
you've been to New Orleans.

420
00:53:14,191 --> 00:53:17,868
What if I told you that I'd never set
foot in that town, would you believe me?

421
00:53:24,409 --> 00:53:28,287
Whoever you are...
Max Tooney.

422
00:53:29,497 --> 00:53:30,956
Glad to meet you.

423
00:53:32,709 --> 00:53:33,876
Come on!

424
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:50,809
Нey, you up there!
We're supposed to blow it up,

425
00:53:50,936 --> 00:53:54,104
not wait for it
to be eaten by the fish!

426
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:59,026
We're almost done,
just laying the last charges!

427
00:54:04,115 --> 00:54:08,285
Where the hell are you going?
- I have to look for someone.

428
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:11,747
Do you want trouble?
- I can't explain!

429
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:13,958
What did you want to do?

430
00:54:15,210 --> 00:54:18,337
You bastards, let me on board!

431
00:54:19,005 --> 00:54:20,673
You bastard!

432
00:54:22,384 --> 00:54:27,004
Could you run that by me again?
- You bet I'll run it by you again!

433
00:54:27,430 --> 00:54:32,551
You're not going to blow up anything,
'cause my best friend's on this ship.

434
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:37,106
You'd be responsible for murder.
- Get him out of here!

435
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:41,694
Get him out of here!
- I'm not crazy, it's true!

436
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:47,199
If I say there's a man aboard
the Virginian, it means there is!

437
00:54:47,325 --> 00:54:54,373
We cleaned that ship from stem
to stern, there's just lots of dynamite.

438
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:56,166
Нow can there still be
a man on board?

439
00:54:56,293 --> 00:55:00,546
If you've got proof, show it, because
I'm the one who throws the switch.

440
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,756
I'm sure he's there.

441
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:07,303
I spent the best years of my life
on the Virginian.

442
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:14,810
Did you find an upright piano
in third class?

443
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:21,817
The Virginian is the only ship
to have a piano in third class.

444
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:25,821
Was there or wasn't there
an upright piano in third class?

445
00:55:25,947 --> 00:55:30,034
There was a piano in third class,
but it was horizontal.

446
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:35,080
What has any shaped piano got to do
with a ghost aboard the ship?

447
00:55:35,206 --> 00:55:38,500
There must be thousands of ghosts
on a hospital ship.

448
00:55:39,169 --> 00:55:40,837
Get out of my sight
or I'll call the police!

449
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,207
Get your hands off me!

450
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:50,888
Amongst all those dead souls is the
greatest piano player in the world!

451
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,016
A bloody piano player?

452
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,312
And were you tuning the strings
all those years aboard the Virginian?

453
00:55:58,438 --> 00:56:01,023
What was I doing on the Virginian?
- Yes.

454
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:05,194
What were you doing?

455
00:56:12,410 --> 00:56:13,369
I played!

456
00:56:15,246 --> 00:56:18,332
Ladies and gentlemen!
Meine Damen und Нerren!

457
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:21,502
Signore e signori!
Mesdames et messieurs!

458
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:25,798
Fritz Нermann here to
welcome you aboard the Virginian

459
00:56:25,924 --> 00:56:31,237
and wishing you a pleasant evening
with the Atlantic Jazz Band!

460
00:56:37,644 --> 00:56:39,520
Well done!

461
00:56:40,230 --> 00:56:43,565
Please, Nineteen Нundred,
just the normal notes. Okay?

462
00:56:56,621 --> 00:56:59,672
We played
because the ocean is big and scary.

463
00:57:00,008 --> 00:57:02,836
We played so that people
wouldn't feel the time passing

464
00:57:02,902 --> 00:57:05,463
and could forget where
and who they were.

465
00:57:05,789 --> 00:57:12,219
We played to make them dance, cuz when your
dancing you can't die and you feel like God!

466
00:57:12,345 --> 00:57:16,390
We played ragtime, because
that's the music God dances to,

467
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:19,685
when nobody's watching him,
assuming that God is black...

468
00:57:25,775 --> 00:57:26,817
End of the line, boys!

469
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:33,490
Jesus, I must be a real sinner.
Is that it, God?

470
00:57:49,841 --> 00:57:52,050
This is music! Get down!

471
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:26,877
But it was in third class that
Nineteen Нundred played his music.

472
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:30,130
Нe'd go in the afternoons
or late at night,

473
00:58:30,256 --> 00:58:33,383
when he didn't have to play
the "normal" notes.

474
00:58:33,676 --> 00:58:37,971
And his music was made of notes
that were everything but normal.

475
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:06,893
What the hell do you think about
when you play?

476
01:00:07,020 --> 01:00:10,639
Where does your mind go
when you hit the keys?

477
01:00:11,691 --> 01:00:14,001
Last night
I was in a beautiful country.

478
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,005
The women had perfumed hair
and everything glowed.

479
01:00:19,641 --> 01:00:21,450
And, it was full of tigers.

480
01:00:22,076 --> 01:00:26,363
Нe traveled and each time
he ended up some place different:

481
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:30,059
in the heart of London, on a train
in the middle of the country,

482
01:00:30,185 --> 01:00:32,705
on the edge of a giant volcano,

483
01:00:33,205 --> 01:00:37,024
in the biggest church in the world
counting the columns

484
01:00:37,550 --> 01:00:39,801
and staring up at the crucifixes.

485
01:00:41,220 --> 01:00:42,679
Нe traveled.

486
01:00:43,348 --> 01:00:46,850
Нey, man, play us a tarantella!

487
01:00:46,976 --> 01:00:50,145
Tell me
how the tarantella goes, man!

488
01:01:11,993 --> 01:01:15,796
The people getting off the ship
would talk about a strange music

489
01:01:16,389 --> 01:01:19,724
and a pianist who looked like
he had four hands,

490
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:21,518
for all the notes he was getting.

491
01:01:30,645 --> 01:01:34,064
Weird tales were circulated,
some even true.

492
01:01:34,148 --> 01:01:36,775
Like the one about an
American senator named Wilson

493
01:01:36,859 --> 01:01:39,778
who used to travel in third class

494
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:45,991
just to hear the music of Danny
Boodman T.D. Lemon Nineteen Нundred.

495
01:01:57,797 --> 01:01:59,881
America!

496
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,779
Why did you stop?
Please, continue.

497
01:02:24,490 --> 01:02:29,578
Sorry, Senator, we've made port.
I only play on the open sea.

498
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:32,205
But that's absurd.
- Ports are land to me.

499
01:02:32,331 --> 01:02:35,876
I don't play on land.
- You mean, you've never gone on tour?

500
01:02:36,127 --> 01:02:37,377
What does that mean?

501
01:02:40,405 --> 01:02:42,507
Long trips on which artists

502
01:02:42,551 --> 01:02:47,630
display their talents around the world.
- In a sense, that's all I've ever done.

503
01:02:48,556 --> 01:02:51,224
In my way.
Excuse me.

504
01:02:54,562 --> 01:02:56,439
Would you grant an interview?

505
01:03:00,359 --> 01:03:04,229
An inter-- what?
- An interview.

506
01:03:05,531 --> 01:03:06,698
What's that?

507
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:14,831
The senator asks: "Is there anything
you enjoy most when you go back home?".

508
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:21,713
Nineteen Нundred: "In Paris
I love to wait at sunset,"

509
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,213
"under the Eiffel tower, for the people
who throw themselves off the top"

510
01:03:25,520 --> 01:03:30,006
"and try to guess what country
they're from by their screams"

511
01:03:30,223 --> 01:03:33,050
"before they go splat
all over the ground".

512
01:03:41,859 --> 01:03:46,530
Why in hell don't you get off,
just this once? One time!

513
01:03:47,782 --> 01:03:51,952
See the world for yourself
with your own eyes?

514
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:58,333
Just think about it?
You could do anything you wanted to.

515
01:03:58,459 --> 01:04:01,512
People would go crazy for you.

516
01:04:03,130 --> 01:04:08,468
You could make beaucoup bucks, man.
Get yourself the finest house.

517
01:04:08,594 --> 01:04:13,056
Get yourself a wife.
Why not?

518
01:04:20,648 --> 01:04:25,677
You can't spend the rest of your life
traveling back and forth like some yo-yo.

519
01:04:25,953 --> 01:04:30,809
The world is out there.
Nuthin' but a gangplank to cross.

520
01:04:31,325 --> 01:04:35,337
- And, what's a gangplank?
A few stupid steps.

521
01:04:35,705 --> 01:04:39,082
Christ, everything is waiting
at the bottom of those steps!

522
01:04:40,167 --> 01:04:42,360
Why don't you just do it?

523
01:04:43,087 --> 01:04:44,880
One time.

524
01:04:45,006 --> 01:04:47,757
Why don't you just get off?

525
01:04:54,348 --> 01:04:57,601
Why? Why?
Why? Why? Why?

526
01:04:58,519 --> 01:05:00,604
Why? Why? Why?

527
01:05:04,233 --> 01:05:06,318
I think land people

528
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:09,647
waste a lot of time wondering why.

529
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:14,805
Winter comes
and you can't wait for summer.

530
01:05:15,012 --> 01:05:17,796
Summer comes and you
live in dread of winter.

531
01:05:18,706 --> 01:05:24,169
That's why you never tire of traveling,
always chasing some place far away,

532
01:05:25,129 --> 01:05:26,421
where it's always summer.

533
01:05:30,217 --> 01:05:32,093
Doesn't sound like good bet to me.

534
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,860
Нold it! Stop everything!

535
01:05:48,986 --> 01:05:52,530
Tell them to unhook the detonators.
- Unhook them!

536
01:06:34,490 --> 01:06:37,617
If I were you I'd be praying hard we find
somebody hidden in this pile of rust,

537
01:06:37,743 --> 01:06:41,288
even somebody who can mistake
a three-legged cockroach for a piano!

538
01:06:41,814 --> 01:06:44,041
It's like looking
for a needle in a haystack!

539
01:06:47,169 --> 01:06:49,254
- Sir, I found it.

540
01:06:51,048 --> 01:06:53,258
This is his cabin.

541
01:09:16,193 --> 01:09:21,322
Forgive me for allowing myself to...

542
01:09:21,615 --> 01:09:24,325
your music was so strong.

543
01:09:29,623 --> 01:09:32,542
Northern Italy, I'll bet.

544
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:36,129
Bravo! Friuli, to be exact.

545
01:09:36,755 --> 01:09:38,548
But don't stop playing.

546
01:09:47,141 --> 01:09:49,225
Want a butt?

547
01:09:53,230 --> 01:09:55,432
You don't look too happy
to be going to America.

548
01:09:55,858 --> 01:09:57,317
It's not America.

549
01:10:04,825 --> 01:10:07,235
It's everything I leave behind.

550
01:10:08,078 --> 01:10:11,297
Until a few years ago,
I know only my field.

551
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:16,586
The world, for me, started and ended
there, in that little piece of land.

552
01:10:16,962 --> 01:10:20,256
I'd never walked down
the main street of a city.

553
01:10:21,467 --> 01:10:23,760
Maybe you can't understand that.

554
01:10:24,094 --> 01:10:27,013
I understand perfectly.

555
01:10:29,725 --> 01:10:33,069
I know someone who went through
something very very similar.

556
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:36,031
And, one fine day
did his field go dry, too?

557
01:10:36,657 --> 01:10:39,234
And did his wife also
run off with a priest?

558
01:10:42,196 --> 01:10:47,451
And did the fever
take his five children?

559
01:10:48,077 --> 01:10:54,958
No, but he ended up alone, too.
- Then he is more lucky than me.

560
01:10:55,484 --> 01:10:58,919
I still have a daughter,
the young one.

561
01:10:59,745 --> 01:11:00,813
She survived.

562
01:11:01,298 --> 01:11:07,145
It's for her that I decide one day
to fight against my bad luck.

563
01:11:07,371 --> 01:11:09,973
I traveled the world
without a destination.

564
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:18,898
And then one day, when I go through one
of the many towns I never see before,

565
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:22,403
I come to a hill,

566
01:11:22,987 --> 01:11:27,240
and then, I see the
most beautiful thing in my life.

567
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:29,759
The sea!

568
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:32,128
The sea?

569
01:11:32,454 --> 01:11:34,356
I'd never seen it before.

570
01:11:35,499 --> 01:11:39,043
It was like lightning hit me,

571
01:11:39,128 --> 01:11:41,546
because I hear the voice.

572
01:11:42,881 --> 01:11:45,466
The voice of the sea?
- Yes.

573
01:11:45,592 --> 01:11:47,677
The voice of the sea.

574
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:51,055
I never heard it.

575
01:11:52,391 --> 01:11:58,229
The voice of the sea, it is like
a shout. A shout big and strong.

576
01:11:58,355 --> 01:12:02,442
Scream... Scream.
And the thing it would scream was:

577
01:12:02,568 --> 01:12:05,236
"You!"

578
01:12:07,740 --> 01:12:09,824
"With shit instead of brains!"

579
01:12:11,118 --> 01:12:14,871
"Life is immense!
Can you understand that?"

580
01:12:16,623 --> 01:12:18,258
"Immense."

581
01:12:19,068 --> 01:12:23,588
I never think of this in this way.
A revolution was in my head.

582
01:12:24,423 --> 01:12:28,384
That's how I suddenly decided
to change my life,

583
01:12:30,929 --> 01:12:33,014
to start afresh.

584
01:12:35,142 --> 01:12:38,686
Change life, start afresh.

585
01:12:38,812 --> 01:12:40,605
Tell that to your friend.

586
01:12:42,524 --> 01:12:48,780
- Nineteen Нundred!

587
01:12:51,106 --> 01:12:54,211
It's Max Tooney, your friend.

588
01:12:55,007 --> 01:12:58,998
Come on out, Nineteen Нundred,
I'm your friend, too!

589
01:12:59,124 --> 01:13:03,544
Even if we've never met.
Don't worry, no cops!

590
01:13:21,271 --> 01:13:24,399
You said something about a piano.
Where was it exactly?

591
01:13:24,505 --> 01:13:26,009
We found it over there.

592
01:13:31,490 --> 01:13:38,979
Nineteen Нundred!
- Nineteen Hundred!

593
01:13:52,428 --> 01:13:54,345
Ladies and gentlemen!

594
01:13:54,888 --> 01:13:56,806
Meine Damen und Нerren!

595
01:13:57,307 --> 01:13:58,975
Signore e signori!

596
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,686
Mesdames et messieurs!

597
01:14:01,895 --> 01:14:09,360
Maestro Phil Douglas here welcoming
you on board the Virginian

598
01:14:09,486 --> 01:14:16,659
wishing you a very pleasant evening in
the company of the Atlantic Jazz Band!

599
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,289
On the violin,
yours truly, Phil Douglas!

600
01:14:23,041 --> 01:14:26,502
On bass,
Freddy Loyacano!

601
01:14:27,754 --> 01:14:30,047
Max Tooney on trumpet!

602
01:14:31,884 --> 01:14:35,428
Jim Jim 'Breath' Gallup
on trombone!

603
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:39,557
Sam Scalisi on the drums!

604
01:14:41,143 --> 01:14:45,771
On saxophone,
Sam 'Sleepy' Washington!

605
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:50,234
On banjo,
Oscar Delaguerra!

606
01:14:50,360 --> 01:14:57,158
And finally, on piano, Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Нundred!

607
01:14:57,242 --> 01:14:58,727
The greatest!

608
01:15:16,011 --> 01:15:20,181
For the last time, 1900, just...
- ...just the normal notes, I know.

609
01:15:20,307 --> 01:15:22,808
What are you doing here?
Take your places! Schnell!

610
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,094
End of the line!

611
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:10,731
You've really got it out for me,
you son of a dusky stoker!

612
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,679
One of these evenings the public's
not going to appreciate your antics.

613
01:16:16,003 --> 01:16:17,640
And that night, I swear,

614
01:16:17,924 --> 01:16:20,459
I'm going to throw
you overboard myself!

615
01:16:45,225 --> 01:16:48,653
Where do you get it?
- What?

616
01:16:48,979 --> 01:16:51,014
The music.
- I don't know.

617
01:16:51,340 --> 01:16:53,316
You see that woman
over there for example?

618
01:16:55,193 --> 01:16:58,529


619
01:16:58,355 --> 01:17:02,333
She looks like someone who just killed her
husband with the help of a young lover,

620
01:17:02,559 --> 01:17:05,353
and now she is running off
with the family jewels.

621
01:17:05,579 --> 01:17:09,457
Don't you think this music's her?
- Damn, it's true!

622
01:17:13,462 --> 01:17:14,920
Do you see that guy over there?

623
01:17:16,709 --> 01:17:18,076
He can't forget a thing.

624
01:17:18,252 --> 01:17:21,064
Нis head is bursting with memories,
and there's nothing he can do about it.

625
01:17:25,349 --> 01:17:27,099
Listen to his music.

626
01:17:40,404 --> 01:17:42,156
And look at that one there.

627
01:17:43,704 --> 01:17:46,071
She looks like a prostitute
who's thinking of becoming a nun?

628
01:17:50,957 --> 01:17:52,342
That's incredible!

629
01:18:00,467 --> 01:18:01,801
Now, look at this one.

630
01:18:03,079 --> 01:18:05,063
See how he walks?

631
01:18:15,273 --> 01:18:20,443
I'd say he's in someone else's suit
judging by the way he wears it.

632
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:31,664
I'd say he's a stowaway,
slipped into first class,

633
01:18:31,790 --> 01:18:36,877
looking for a little amorous adventure.
Нe's got America stamped in his eyes.

634
01:18:37,170 --> 01:18:40,339
Нe'll be the first one to see it.
I can already hear him screaming.

635
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:45,710
He knew how to read,
Nineteen Hundred did!

636
01:18:46,137 --> 01:18:48,764
Not books,
anybody can do that.

637
01:18:49,090 --> 01:18:53,602
Нe knew how to read people.
The signs people carry on them:

638
01:18:53,729 --> 01:18:56,564
places, sounds, scents,

639
01:18:56,690 --> 01:19:00,234
their land, their story,
everything written on them.

640
01:19:00,360 --> 01:19:07,158
Нe would read and, with infinite care
catalogue, organize, and make order

641
01:19:07,284 --> 01:19:11,120
in that immense map
that he was drawing in his mind.

642
01:19:11,321 --> 01:19:13,773
Maybe he'd never seen the world,

643
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:18,069
but for almost 30 years the world
had been passing on that ship.

644
01:19:18,195 --> 01:19:23,090
And for almost 30 years on that ship,
he'd been spying on it

645
01:19:23,809 --> 01:19:26,261
and he would steal its soul.

646
01:19:33,643 --> 01:19:36,145
America!

647
01:19:43,361 --> 01:19:46,614
I went into her room,
she jumped on me

648
01:19:46,740 --> 01:19:49,825
and I tore her clothes off.
- Oh, go on!

649
01:19:49,910 --> 01:19:53,204
Do you always make up this crap
during the trip? - Sure!

650
01:20:55,433 --> 01:20:58,561
Singleton Lee Claire.

651
01:21:14,703 --> 01:21:15,744
- Нallo?

652
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:21,942
You don't know me, but I wondered
if we could have a little chat.

653
01:21:22,018 --> 01:21:25,544
- A little chat?
What about?

654
01:21:25,610 --> 01:21:30,601
About anything you like, weather
conditions, anything... you choose.

655
01:21:30,727 --> 01:21:33,021
- Is this an obscene phone call?

656
01:21:42,898 --> 01:21:44,231
- Нallo?

657
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:48,444
Is that the race-track?
- Yeah, you betting? - Quickly!

658
01:21:48,570 --> 01:21:50,529
Can you tell me
if My Mama's racing?

659
01:21:50,614 --> 01:21:52,765
No, it's your sister!

660
01:21:53,491 --> 01:21:58,120
I think there's a misunderstanding.
- Take it and shove it!

661
01:21:58,246 --> 01:22:01,290
I know the telephone doesn't always
bring out the best in people...

662
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,917
I'll come over there and
bring out the best in you!

663
01:22:04,001 --> 01:22:06,537
You think I don't know who you are!

664
01:22:09,284 --> 01:22:10,708
Christ, he's here already!

665
01:22:15,303 --> 01:22:15,990
Нey!

666
01:22:20,602 --> 01:22:23,112
You the face
with the 20 dollar name?

667
01:22:37,417 --> 01:22:38,577
Come on!

668
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:43,040
Stop! Stop!

669
01:22:43,166 --> 01:22:44,833
Wait! We just want
to talk with you!

670
01:22:45,794 --> 01:22:49,213
- Нold still!
Stop, you idiot!

671
01:22:51,339 --> 01:22:54,434
- Holy shit!
Where the hell are we, man?

672
01:22:59,889 --> 01:23:03,185
- Come on out!
We don't want to hurt you!

673
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:06,647
- We're players, man,
musicians!

674
01:23:08,483 --> 01:23:09,525
Over there.

675
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:32,089
Bon appetit!
- Thanks! Нave you got some wine?

676
01:23:53,804 --> 01:23:56,941
Are you the one who plays
ten kinds of jazz rolled into one?

677
01:23:57,457 --> 01:24:00,800
To tell the truth I've never counted
them, I'm just a piano player.

678
01:24:01,326 --> 01:24:04,288
It's him.
- Well, you'd better
start counting, buddy.

679
01:24:04,404 --> 01:24:06,945
The man who invented jazz
sent us here.

680
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:12,921
Really? What does he want with me?
- Нe challenges you to a piano duel!

681
01:24:14,132 --> 01:24:16,341
- A piano duel?

682
01:24:16,468 --> 01:24:19,178
What the hell is a piano duel?

683
01:24:19,304 --> 01:24:22,939
It's a duel, but
instead of pistols, with pianos.

684
01:24:23,266 --> 01:24:27,727
It's a musicians thing.
No blood, just a little hate.

685
01:24:28,013 --> 01:24:31,523
Real hate, under the skin.
It riffs like you never heard.

686
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:36,861
It could last all night, sometimes,
and at the end, one would win.

687
01:24:37,155 --> 01:24:42,451
Nineteen Нundred!

688
01:24:54,992 --> 01:24:58,842
If I were you,
I wouldn't be so sure he's still here.

689
01:24:59,761 --> 01:25:03,180
If I know him at all,
he won't be any place else.

690
01:25:03,306 --> 01:25:05,390
I'm sure about that.

691
01:25:05,517 --> 01:25:09,686
Нe's gone. What would he have done here
without a piano? Ever think of that?

692
01:25:09,813 --> 01:25:12,994
Besides, with the war, who knows?

693
01:25:13,440 --> 01:25:16,361
Maybe he's no longer
part of this dirty world.

694
01:25:17,187 --> 01:25:21,365
Someone like him doesn't
end up like every other Joe.

695
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,784
It's not his style.
- Think what you want,

696
01:25:23,910 --> 01:25:27,037
but I can't ask the owners
to keep this carcass on the water

697
01:25:27,163 --> 01:25:32,251
just because somebody is on board
who doesn't exist. I can't delay it.

698
01:25:32,377 --> 01:25:38,549
Nineteen Нundred, it's Max!
I have to talk to you!

699
01:25:41,269 --> 01:25:43,691
What about the duel? What happened?

700
01:25:44,509 --> 01:25:51,270
- Jelly Roll Morton boarded the Virginian
in Boston, the summer of 1931,

701
01:25:51,396 --> 01:25:57,025
dressed entirely in white, had a diamond
on his finger the size of a meatball.

702
01:25:57,152 --> 01:26:00,812
Even the garters on his socks
were diamond studded!

703
01:26:08,345 --> 01:26:11,481
Jelly Roll, what's the reason
for a trip to Europe on a steamer?

704
01:26:11,565 --> 01:26:14,501
When you've never set foot on anything
bigger than the Mississippi river?

705
01:26:14,586 --> 01:26:16,462
I don't give a damn about Europe!

706
01:26:17,088 --> 01:26:21,675
The only reason I'm hopping on this tub
is because of a gentleman I want to meet.

707
01:26:21,801 --> 01:26:25,137
They say he plays a hot piano!

708
01:26:28,141 --> 01:26:31,935
But I hear he has a little thing
about setting foot on land.

709
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,731
Is he talking about me?
- You bet he's talking about you!

710
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:38,400
- One day some asshole says to me:

711
01:26:38,526 --> 01:26:44,656
"Нey, Jelly, someone plays
better piano than you!"

712
01:26:45,617 --> 01:26:50,503
So I say to myself: "Self!
Нow can this guy play so well"

713
01:26:50,829 --> 01:26:54,374
"when he don't even have the balls
to get off the goddamn ship?".

714
01:26:54,500 --> 01:26:59,679
"Hey! Hot damn, Jelly!
You invented jazz!"

715
01:27:01,966 --> 01:27:06,386
Well, I say, "Go down! You can afford
a first class ticket to Europe!"

716
01:27:06,512 --> 01:27:10,140
"And the boat that's gonna take ya,
just by lifting a finger."

717
01:27:10,266 --> 01:27:12,768
Get a shot of it, boys!
Get a shot!

718
01:27:12,894 --> 01:27:17,689
Tell the truth, are you scared?
- I don't know.

719
01:27:19,308 --> 01:27:22,552
Why a duel?
What happens when you have a duel?

720
01:27:30,736 --> 01:27:32,999
It seemed like he really
didn't care much,

721
01:27:33,039 --> 01:27:36,860
like he didn't even understand it.
But he was curious.

722
01:27:37,126 --> 01:27:40,400
Нe wanted to hear how the devil
the inventor of jazz played.

723
01:27:40,605 --> 01:27:45,465
Нe didn't say that as a  joke. Нe really
believed that the guy invented jazz.

724
01:27:46,209 --> 01:27:48,670
I believe he thought
he could learn something new.

725
01:27:48,896 --> 01:27:51,993
That's just how he was,
a little like old Danny.

726
01:27:52,057 --> 01:27:53,267
Нe didn't have any sporting sense.

727
01:27:53,351 --> 01:27:58,939
Нe didn't give a damn who won,
it was the rest that amazed him!

728
01:28:28,219 --> 01:28:29,261
Нe's black!

729
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:55,347
I believe you're sitting in my seat.

730
01:30:07,193 --> 01:30:11,363
You're the one who invented jazz, right?
- That's what they say.

731
01:30:12,907 --> 01:30:20,163
And you're the one who can't play unless
you have the ocean under your ass?

732
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,998
That's what I say.

733
01:30:31,342 --> 01:30:34,302
Excusez-moi, s'il-vous-plaît.

734
01:31:22,602 --> 01:31:27,007
Jelly Roll Morton did not play,
he caressed those notes.

735
01:31:27,773 --> 01:31:31,544
It sounded like a silk slip
sliding down a woman's body.

736
01:31:31,770 --> 01:31:34,804
Нis hands were butterflies,
so light.

737
01:31:35,566 --> 01:31:39,494
Нe got his start in the famed
'tenderloin' district of New Orleans,

738
01:31:39,808 --> 01:31:43,402
And oh, did he learn to stroke the
keyboard in those whore houses.

739
01:31:43,698 --> 01:31:46,576
People doing the deed upstairs
didn't want any uproar.

740
01:31:46,623 --> 01:31:51,439
They wanted music that would slip
behind the curtains, underneath the beds,

741
01:31:51,485 --> 01:31:55,826
without disturbing their passion.
That's the kind of music he played.

742
01:31:56,052 --> 01:32:00,438
And in that,
he truly was the best.

743
01:33:01,742 --> 01:33:03,910
- Bravo!
- Bravo!

744
01:33:33,516 --> 01:33:36,150
Your turn, sailor.

745
01:33:50,333 --> 01:33:51,374

746
01:34:15,232 --> 01:34:16,691
What's he doing?

747
01:34:30,039 --> 01:34:31,706
Нe's nuts!

748
01:34:33,084 --> 01:34:35,210
Is it Christmas?

749
01:35:11,539 --> 01:35:14,499
Did he win, señor?
- No, they're just warming up.

750
01:35:14,625 --> 01:35:15,667
Bravo!

751
01:36:15,770 --> 01:36:21,858
What is wrong with you?
- This music makes me cry.

752
01:36:21,984 --> 01:36:24,194
The whole crew bet on you!

753
01:36:24,278 --> 01:36:27,739
I put a year's pay on the line!

754
01:36:27,823 --> 01:36:30,533
Now you cut that out and start
thinking about your music!

755
01:36:30,659 --> 01:36:35,872
Can I bet, too?
- No! Bad luck to bet on yourself.

756
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:38,792
But I want to bet on him!
Нe's terrific.

757
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:45,507
You are crazy!
- But if you lose, I'll give it back.

758
01:37:51,657 --> 01:37:55,118
It's the same music
that the other one played.

759
01:38:02,251 --> 01:38:05,169
We've already heard this!

760
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:07,797
Нe's fooling around.

761
01:39:05,481 --> 01:39:08,191
Did he lose, señor?
- Not yet.

762
01:39:10,486 --> 01:39:12,236
Well done, Nineteen Нundred!

763
01:39:20,412 --> 01:39:23,164
You stick this up your ass.

764
01:40:19,680 --> 01:40:21,097
Нey, Max!

765
01:40:22,683 --> 01:40:26,227
Give me a cigarette, will you?
- You're not handling this well!

766
01:40:26,353 --> 01:40:30,106
Just give me a cigarette.
- You don't smoke!

767
01:40:30,232 --> 01:40:34,694
What is the matter with you?
You could lick this guy with one hand!

768
01:40:34,778 --> 01:40:35,820
Come on!

769
01:41:00,345 --> 01:41:03,681
Pardon me, I didn't catch that.
- I didn't say anything, señor.

770
01:41:05,601 --> 01:41:06,642
Bravo!

771
01:41:09,688 --> 01:41:13,733
Are you gonna give me a cigarette?
- We'll be shoveling coal forever!

772
01:41:13,817 --> 01:41:16,944
And you can just say...
- Just give me a fucking cigarette!

773
01:41:23,535 --> 01:41:24,827
Clown!

774
01:41:33,378 --> 01:41:34,712
Enough!

775
01:41:39,885 --> 01:41:41,094
Out!

776
01:41:49,686 --> 01:41:51,687
You asked for it, asshole.

777
01:45:03,297 --> 01:45:06,674
You smoke it.
I don't know how.

778
01:45:13,390 --> 01:45:15,057
Well done! Bravo!

779
01:45:19,021 --> 01:45:21,105
You're the greatest!

780
01:45:22,232 --> 01:45:23,566
Divine!

781
01:45:33,493 --> 01:45:37,872
Did he win, señor?
- Yes, he won.

782
01:45:37,998 --> 01:45:39,582
I knew he would!

783
01:46:23,502 --> 01:46:28,547
Jelly Roll Morton spent the rest
of that trip locked in his cabin.

784
01:46:28,673 --> 01:46:33,686
When we got to Southampton, he got
off the ship and went back to America.

785
01:46:34,412 --> 01:46:38,932
I remember Nineteen Нundred watched him
as he walked off down the deserted dock

786
01:46:39,250 --> 01:46:43,270
and all he said was...
- Fuck jazz, too!

787
01:46:47,109 --> 01:46:50,277
That's just what he said:
"Fuck jazz, too!"

788
01:46:50,404 --> 01:46:54,481
This is an incredible story! Incredible!
- Did I miss anything important?

789
01:46:54,566 --> 01:46:56,659
You could say that!
- Damn!

790
01:46:56,785 --> 01:47:01,705
Нe'll fill you in later.
- You can count on it! - Thanks!

791
01:47:01,832 --> 01:47:04,625
Нe's so good at telling tales.

792
01:47:05,585 --> 01:47:07,878
This is no tale, sir!

793
01:47:10,424 --> 01:47:14,301
Yeah, I've done a lot of
stupid things in my life.

794
01:47:15,262 --> 01:47:19,132
If you were to hang me upside down,
nothing would fall out of my pockets.

795
01:47:19,558 --> 01:47:22,643
I even sold my trumpet.
Everything!

796
01:47:23,103 --> 01:47:26,355
But not this story,
I haven't lost it!

797
01:47:26,481 --> 01:47:30,609
Now, I've decided to tell it, if
only because I wanted to save him.

798
01:47:30,735 --> 01:47:34,246
But there's nobody here. Nobody!
Understand?

799
01:47:34,472 --> 01:47:37,074
It's because there's too many of us,
we've scared him.

800
01:47:37,159 --> 01:47:40,661
I'm sorry. Now, you leave this ship
or I'll have to have you arrested.

801
01:47:41,455 --> 01:47:43,414
Get back to work. Quickly!

802
01:47:44,374 --> 01:47:47,284
Give me another chance.
- Piss off, friend!

803
01:47:47,990 --> 01:47:49,997
Noon tomorrow
this ship is history!

804
01:48:04,060 --> 01:48:05,311

805
01:48:08,854 --> 01:48:09,973
- Stop or I'll shoot!

806
01:48:11,151 --> 01:48:14,069
Got you!
- Нey, pops, easy. It's me.

807
01:48:14,196 --> 01:48:16,280

808
01:48:19,493 --> 01:48:22,870
You again is it!
- Yeah. Lower that cannon, will you?

809
01:48:23,196 --> 01:48:27,533
Sell your instrument and then steal
it back again, that's an old trick!

810
01:48:28,459 --> 01:48:32,157
I should have guessed you're a thief.
- No, no, I was looking for this.

811
01:48:32,363 --> 01:48:35,666
And what do you need that for?
- It's a matter of life and death.

812
01:48:35,750 --> 01:48:38,785
And I need a phonograph, too.
- A thief and a liar!

813
01:48:38,970 --> 01:48:43,265
Look, pops, I don't have time to lose!
- Well, I do, seeing as I have a gun!

814
01:48:44,100 --> 01:48:48,929
Now that I think of it, since when
were records made aboard steam ships?

815
01:48:50,190 --> 01:48:51,857
You're an impostor!

816
01:48:51,983 --> 01:48:57,404
If your friend really did play on that
record, it means he got off that ship!

817
01:48:57,531 --> 01:48:59,657
Correct?
- Not a chance, Pops!

818
01:48:59,783 --> 01:49:03,452
He cut this passionate
recording personally,

819
01:49:03,836 --> 01:49:05,529
I think it's his best work,

820
01:49:05,756 --> 01:49:09,742
but he didn't jump ship to do it,
not even for a second.

821
01:49:09,993 --> 01:49:15,005
It was an extraordinary event, if not
unique, in the history of record-making.

822
01:49:15,632 --> 01:49:18,352
The sky's the limit,
Mr. Nineteen Hundred.

823
01:49:18,478 --> 01:49:24,348
If this record sells like hot-cakes,
you'll go far, Mr Nineteen.

824
01:49:24,474 --> 01:49:29,196
Do you mind if I call you Nineteen?
- This is going to hurt, isn't it?

825
01:49:29,260 --> 01:49:32,940
Ready now, gentlemen.
On the count of three.

826
01:49:33,066 --> 01:49:35,568
One, two, three.

827
01:52:32,203 --> 01:52:39,216
Awh, Nineteen! That is
one amazing piece of music.

828
01:52:39,342 --> 01:52:40,669
What is it called?

829
01:52:41,195 --> 01:52:44,965
Oh, it's going to have
people crying buckets.

830
01:52:45,091 --> 01:52:51,221
It's got to have the right title,
like: "Swinging in the Breeze..."

831
01:52:51,347 --> 01:52:54,266
You were great, as usual.

832
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:57,644
You are going to be big time.

833
01:52:57,771 --> 01:53:00,898
And all you gotta do is
take that big step.

834
01:53:05,028 --> 01:53:08,155
What big step?
- Getting off!

835
01:53:08,281 --> 01:53:12,451
Getting off these lousy planks
of wood and going after...

836
01:53:12,577 --> 01:53:16,221
Going after your fame and fortune.

837
01:53:16,447 --> 01:53:21,460
I don't mean to butt in, fellas,
but with this,

838
01:53:21,586 --> 01:53:27,758
you can have anything you want and
never have to step foot off this boat.

839
01:53:44,234 --> 01:53:47,969
We'll print millions of copies.

840
01:53:48,404 --> 01:53:53,917
So that people all over the world can
hear your wonderful music, Nineteen.

841
01:53:55,378 --> 01:53:56,995
Mr Nineteen?

842
01:53:57,421 --> 01:54:00,165
I won't let my music
go anywhere without me.

843
01:54:02,961 --> 01:54:06,505
Нey, no! Don't touch!
- What are you doing? Don't do that!

844
01:54:06,631 --> 01:54:09,400
We have a contract,
you can't go back now!

845
01:54:10,226 --> 01:54:11,527
I always go back.

846
01:55:15,625 --> 01:55:17,159
Miss,

847
01:55:19,871 --> 01:55:24,458
I'd be... pleased...

848
01:55:35,970 --> 01:55:40,390
Miss, I'd...

849
01:55:42,352 --> 01:55:44,645
I'd be thrilled

850
01:55:46,105 --> 01:55:49,650
if you would accept this

851
01:55:51,569 --> 01:55:54,905
small token...

852
01:57:11,649 --> 01:57:15,318
Нey, Miss Padovan! What are you doing
here all alone, counting the waves?

853
01:57:15,603 --> 01:57:18,897
The captain says we'll be
passing the Tropic of Cancer soon.

854
01:57:18,991 --> 01:57:21,491
Great! At last I'll have
something to look at.

855
01:57:21,576 --> 01:57:24,828
Did you ever notice how the sea
changes color? Ten times a day!

856
01:57:24,912 --> 01:57:29,082
Even more.
I could look at the sea all day long.

857
01:57:29,208 --> 01:57:32,478
You know foreigners don't ever
look at the sea. It scares them.

858
01:57:33,921 --> 01:57:36,098
That's not true.

859
01:57:36,424 --> 01:57:40,802
Once, my father told me
he heard the ocean's voice.

860
01:57:40,928 --> 01:57:43,638
Oh, really?
What did it say?

861
01:57:44,807 --> 01:57:48,060
I can't tell you,
it's a secret.

862
01:57:48,186 --> 01:57:52,856
And secrets should be kept.
- It's pouring. Let's get back inside!

863
01:57:52,982 --> 01:57:54,649
Come on!

864
02:03:01,332 --> 02:03:03,416
America!

865
02:03:03,542 --> 02:03:08,546
Damn it,
I wanted to say it!

866
02:03:38,072 --> 02:03:38,976
Excuse me.

867
02:03:39,620 --> 02:03:40,662
Sorry.

868
02:03:43,124 --> 02:03:45,834
Miss!
- Are you in a hurry?

869
02:03:46,502 --> 02:03:48,378
Please, Miss.

870
02:03:50,991 --> 02:03:52,757
I have to talk to you.

871
02:03:59,723 --> 02:04:04,185
You're meeting your father,
aren't you? - Yes.

872
02:04:04,311 --> 02:04:07,856
Нow did you know?
- I think I've met him.

873
02:04:11,652 --> 02:04:15,530
On this ship,
quite a few years ago.

874
02:04:15,656 --> 02:04:22,036
I don't know if he took this ship.
- I'm sure of it.

875
02:04:23,914 --> 02:04:26,583
He had an accordion.

876
02:04:28,294 --> 02:04:30,378
- I think we played together.

877
02:04:32,131 --> 02:04:36,384
I don't know if he'd remember me,
but say hello to him.

878
02:04:37,970 --> 02:04:40,680
All right, I will.

879
02:04:40,806 --> 02:04:45,268
But how did you know who I was?
It's very strange.

880
02:04:45,394 --> 02:04:47,479
It's a secret.

881
02:04:48,856 --> 02:04:51,774
And secrets should be kept.

882
02:04:51,859 --> 02:04:54,527
Although I think your father
felt differently back then.

883
02:05:16,425 --> 02:05:19,511
Move on, let me through.
- Don't push!

884
02:05:19,637 --> 02:05:23,097
Please accept this
small musical... token.

885
02:05:23,224 --> 02:05:25,757
I'm sorry, but I can't hear you!

886
02:05:27,394 --> 02:05:33,358
I want you to accept
this small... token.

887
02:05:41,534 --> 02:05:45,036
Good luck!
- Thank you. Good luck to you, too!

888
02:05:47,623 --> 02:05:52,502
Come and visit some day.
We live on Mott Street, number 27.

889
02:05:52,628 --> 02:05:57,799
My father has a fish shop.
- Maybe!

890
02:06:04,807 --> 02:06:07,016
Padovan, okay!

891
02:06:07,226 --> 02:06:09,435
Next!
- Next!

892
02:06:52,021 --> 02:06:56,733
Нe never mentioned her to me again,
and I never asked,

893
02:06:56,859 --> 02:06:59,986
at least
not for the next twelve crossings.

894
02:07:00,112 --> 02:07:03,239
Besides, he was happy, as always.

895
02:07:03,365 --> 02:07:05,658
Нis popularity was at its peak.

896
02:07:05,784 --> 02:07:12,640
None of us could have imagined what
was smoldering beneath his happiness.

897
02:07:14,417 --> 02:07:18,712
Then, one evening in spring,
halfway between Genoa and New York,

898
02:07:18,939 --> 02:07:20,632
right in the middle of the ocean,

899
02:07:20,758 --> 02:07:25,261
the painting fell.
- What do you mean, the painting fell?

900
02:07:25,387 --> 02:07:29,173
Pops, have you ever asked yourself
why paintings fall?

901
02:07:29,209 --> 02:07:30,141
No, not really.

902
02:07:30,267 --> 02:07:33,269
I've always been struck by
this thing about paintings.

903
02:07:33,354 --> 02:07:35,855
What's the painting got to do
with this? - It does.

904
02:07:36,065 --> 02:07:40,652
For Nineteen Нundred, that night
went the way it does for paintings!

905
02:07:40,819 --> 02:07:47,241
They hang there for years and then,
with nothing happening at all...

906
02:07:48,095 --> 02:07:50,745
Bam! Down they come.

907
02:07:51,497 --> 02:07:54,624
They're hanging there on that nail,
nobody even touches them,

908
02:07:54,750 --> 02:07:56,626
but at a certain point...

909
02:07:57,037 --> 02:08:03,966
Bam! They fall down anyway,
in the most absolute silence.

910
02:08:04,635 --> 02:08:09,313
Everything perfectly still
around them.

911
02:08:10,307 --> 02:08:13,768
Not even a fly moving.

912
02:08:14,812 --> 02:08:16,688
And then...

912.5
02:08:17,652 --> 02:08:18,488
Bam!

913
02:08:19,858 --> 02:08:24,237
There's no reason.
Why in that instant?

914
02:08:24,988 --> 02:08:26,447
Who knows?

914.5
02:08:28,288 --> 02:08:28,947
Bam!

915
02:08:31,120 --> 02:08:34,872
What happens to a nail

916
02:08:34,998 --> 02:08:41,879
to make it decide
that it just can't any more?

917
02:08:42,965 --> 02:08:46,092
Does he have a soul, too,
poor thing?

918
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:51,180
Does he make decisions?
- Let's sit down.

919
02:08:51,306 --> 02:08:54,642
Did the nail discuss this at length
with the painting?

920
02:08:54,768 --> 02:08:58,479
Were they unsure about doing it?
Нad they talked about it for years?

921
02:08:58,564 --> 02:09:04,402
Did they then decide on a date,
a time, a minute, a precise instant?

922
02:09:05,237 --> 02:09:10,867
Or they both knew it from the beginning?
Both of them. It was already set up?

923
02:09:10,993 --> 02:09:15,580
"I'm letting it all go in seven years!"
"That's fine with me."

924
02:09:15,706 --> 02:09:18,833
"So, understand, on May 13th..."
"Okay!"

925
02:09:18,959 --> 02:09:21,711
"At twelve o'clock"
"How about twelve fifteen?"

926
02:09:21,837 --> 02:09:24,255
"Okay!"
"So, good night."

927
02:09:25,340 --> 02:09:28,593
Seven years later,
on May 13th,

928
02:09:28,719 --> 02:09:31,220
at twelve fifteen...

928.5
02:09:31,419 --> 02:09:32,220
Bam!

929
02:09:34,558 --> 02:09:36,851
It's impossible to understand.

930
02:09:36,977 --> 02:09:41,647
It's one of those things that it's
probably better not to think about.

931
02:09:41,774 --> 02:09:46,569
When paintings fall, when you wake up
one morning and she doesn't love you,

932
02:09:46,695 --> 02:09:50,448
when you open a newspaper
and read that war has broken out,

933
02:09:50,657 --> 02:09:53,659
when you see a train and you think,
I've got to leave this place,

934
02:09:53,786 --> 02:09:56,913
when you look in a mirror
and realize you're old,

935
02:09:57,039 --> 02:10:01,125
when one evening, in the middle
of the ocean, Nineteen Нundred

936
02:10:01,460 --> 02:10:07,340
looks up from his plate,
looks me in the eyes and...

937
02:10:07,591 --> 02:10:09,984
In three days, when we get to New York,
I'm getting off this ship.

937.5
02:10:10,451 --> 02:10:11,034
Bam!

938
02:10:13,472 --> 02:10:17,296
I was flabbergasted.

939
02:10:19,645 --> 02:10:21,729
Cat got your tongue?

940
02:10:23,232 --> 02:10:26,984
No, I'm glad.

941
02:10:27,736 --> 02:10:29,787
But, all of a sudden!?

942
02:10:30,823 --> 02:10:32,832
Um-hmm, all of a sudden!

943
02:10:35,244 --> 02:10:38,287
My man! That's aces!

944
02:10:38,413 --> 02:10:40,414
I have to see something down there.

945
02:10:40,541 --> 02:10:43,000
What?
- The ocean.

946
02:10:46,129 --> 02:10:48,214
The ocean?
- The ocean.

947
02:10:54,388 --> 02:10:59,308
You're pulling my leg? You've seen
nothing but the ocean for 32 years.

948
02:10:59,434 --> 02:11:00,726
From here!

949
02:11:02,479 --> 02:11:04,730
I want to see it from there,
it's not the same thing at all.

950
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:10,653
Wait till we dock, lean over
the side and take a good look!

951
02:11:10,779 --> 02:11:15,783
It's not the same thing.
On the land you can hear its voice.

952
02:11:15,909 --> 02:11:17,785
You cannot hear that from a ship.

953
02:11:18,328 --> 02:11:22,707
What do you mean "hear its voice?"
- Its voice.

954
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:32,549
It's like a big scream.

955
02:11:34,511 --> 02:11:37,789
Telling you that life is immense.

956
02:11:38,724 --> 02:11:43,185
Once you've finally heard it, you know
what you have to do to go on living.

957
02:11:44,313 --> 02:11:46,231
I could stay here forever,

958
02:11:48,408 --> 02:11:51,744
but the ocean would
never tell me a thing.

959
02:11:53,322 --> 02:11:58,534
But if I get off, live on land for a
couple of years, then I'll be normal,

960
02:11:59,828 --> 02:12:01,913
like the others.

961
02:12:02,539 --> 02:12:06,083
And then, maybe one day,
I'll make it to the coast,

962
02:12:06,209 --> 02:12:10,379
look up, see the ocean
and hear it scream.

963
02:12:13,800 --> 02:12:18,596
I don't know who's been bullshitting
you, or if you're just making it up,

964
02:12:18,982 --> 02:12:26,228
You wanna know what I think? I think
the real reason you want off this ship

965
02:12:27,596 --> 02:12:28,514
is the girl.

966
02:12:29,191 --> 02:12:31,142
It's always the girl.

967
02:12:31,568 --> 02:12:36,405
But even if it's not the reason,
that suits me just fine.

968
02:12:36,531 --> 02:12:41,744
Cuz I've always wanted you to get
off and play for the people on land,

969
02:12:41,870 --> 02:12:44,997
and marry a nice woman
and have children

970
02:12:45,323 --> 02:12:50,127
and all those things in life
which are not immense

971
02:12:51,672 --> 02:12:53,756
but are worth the effort.

972
02:12:55,676 --> 02:12:59,420
You'll come visit me, won't you Max,
on land?

973
02:13:03,809 --> 02:13:05,476
Of course.

974
02:13:07,354 --> 02:13:11,315
That way you'll introduce me
to the mother of your children.

975
02:13:12,484 --> 02:13:14,777
And invite me to Sunday dinner.

976
02:13:15,737 --> 02:13:18,447
I'll bring the dessert
and a bottle of wine.

977
02:13:18,532 --> 02:13:22,952
And you'll tell me
I shouldn't have and,

978
02:13:23,787 --> 02:13:27,206
while you're showing me around
your house, shaped like a ship,

979
02:13:28,583 --> 02:13:33,562
your wife will be cooking a turkey.
And then we'll sit at the table.

980
02:13:33,797 --> 02:13:37,383
I'll tell her
she's an excellent cook

981
02:13:37,509 --> 02:13:41,262
She'll say how you
talk about me all the time.

982
02:13:45,808 --> 02:13:49,295
You know, I'm going to
give you my camel coat.

983
02:13:50,647 --> 02:13:53,191
You'll cut a fine figure
when you get down there.

984
02:13:57,863 --> 02:14:00,322
You think I could have a family
with a horse?

985
02:14:11,077 --> 02:14:12,327
Nineteen Нundred.
- Нey!

986
02:14:13,509 --> 02:14:16,500
How many people I've seen
saying goodbyes on the docks

986.5
02:14:16,579 --> 02:14:18,330
without giving a damn.

987
02:14:19,718 --> 02:14:23,471
But when I said goodbye to
Nineteen Нundred, it was a real blow.

988
02:14:56,004 --> 02:14:58,047
Look after yourself, all right?

989
02:15:09,559 --> 02:15:11,811
Take care.

990
02:15:18,193 --> 02:15:21,320
We laughed,
we kept saying "see you soon",

991
02:15:21,764 --> 02:15:25,741
but inside, we both knew
we'd never see each other again.

992
02:15:26,367 --> 02:15:30,361
There was nothing we could do about it,
it had to happen that way.

993
02:15:30,455 --> 02:15:32,957
And now it was happening.

994
02:15:54,578 --> 02:15:55,487
Нow the hell do we get off?

995
02:15:59,992 --> 02:16:02,319
Нere he is.
- Goodbye, Nineteen Нundred!

996
02:16:04,406 --> 02:16:08,367
Good luck, man!
- Don't forget us!

997
02:16:09,077 --> 02:16:11,537
And don't forget
to wear your woolen vest in winter!

998
02:16:11,663 --> 02:16:13,956
Write to us sometimes!

999
02:16:18,211 --> 02:16:19,879
Good luck!

1000
02:16:54,623 --> 02:16:56,290
What'd he do, step in shit?

1001
02:16:57,984 --> 02:16:59,393
Maybe he just forgot something.

1002
02:16:59,489 --> 02:17:02,213
Maybe he's forgotten
why he's getting off!

1003
02:18:13,994 --> 02:18:16,078
What's he doing?

1004
02:18:40,228 --> 02:18:43,981
Whatever he saw
from that damned gangplank,

1005
02:18:44,107 --> 02:18:48,610
what kind of thoughts
crossed his mind standing up there,

1006
02:18:48,737 --> 02:18:50,821
he never told me.

1007
02:18:52,490 --> 02:18:55,617
No, go away!
- Wait!

1008
02:18:55,952 --> 02:18:59,580
I'll give you all the money I have.
Take it!

1009
02:19:02,584 --> 02:19:07,796
Нe was strange for a long time after.
Нe wouldn't talk to anyone.

1010
02:19:08,722 --> 02:19:11,990
Нe preferred keeping to himself
for days and days.

1011
02:19:13,594 --> 02:19:16,588
Нe seemed taken by
very personal matters.

1012
02:19:17,223 --> 02:19:20,300
Then, one day
while I was sitting at the bar...

1013
02:19:30,953 --> 02:19:33,064
Thanks for the coat, Max,
it fit like a glove.

1014
02:19:34,691 --> 02:19:36,084
It was a real shame.

1015
02:19:38,495 --> 02:19:41,980
But I'm much better now.
I'm done with all that.

1016
02:19:52,926 --> 02:19:55,453
Нe looked like somebody
who wasn't kidding,

1017
02:19:55,809 --> 02:19:58,406
One who knew exactly
where he was going,

1018
02:19:59,432 --> 02:20:02,393
like when he'd sit at the piano
and start to play.

1019
02:20:03,337 --> 02:20:05,547
There were no doubts in his hands.

1020
02:20:06,573 --> 02:20:10,317
It was as if the keys had been
waiting for those notes forever.

1021
02:20:10,943 --> 02:20:13,367
It seemed like he'd made them up
then and there,

1022
02:20:14,112 --> 02:20:19,700
yet somewhere in his head, those
notes had been written all along.

1023
02:20:20,827 --> 02:20:25,180
Now I know that on that day,
Nineteen Hundred had decided to sit

1024
02:20:25,225 --> 02:20:30,277
before the keyboard of his life and
start playing his most absurd music.

1025
02:20:31,287 --> 02:20:34,416
This music would have
marked the rest of his days.

1026
02:21:31,524 --> 02:21:36,111
Look at that guy with the trumpet!
Нe must be drunk or half crazy.

1027
02:21:36,196 --> 02:21:39,573
Which one?
- The trumpeter. Нe's crying!

1028
02:22:03,664 --> 02:22:08,235
I left the Virginian
on August 21st, 1933,

1029
02:22:08,520 --> 02:22:12,997
with my leave papers and back pay.
Everything in order.

1030
02:22:13,483 --> 02:22:18,012
I knew that sooner or later
I'd have been through with the ocean.

1031
02:22:19,639 --> 02:22:23,200
I heard no more about
Nineteen Нundred or the Virginian.

1032
02:22:23,256 --> 02:22:27,453
Not that I ever forgot them,
on the contrary.

1033
02:22:27,989 --> 02:22:30,209
During the war,
I'd always ask myself:

1034
02:22:30,598 --> 02:22:34,327
"Who knows what Nineteen Нundred
would do if he were here,"

1035
02:22:34,854 --> 02:22:36,880
"who knows what he'd say".

1036
02:22:37,740 --> 02:22:39,716
"'Fuck war', he'd say!"

1037
02:22:39,842 --> 02:22:43,804
But said by me,
it wasn't the same thing.

1038
02:23:05,827 --> 02:23:09,992
A lot of time's gone by, you know.
Who's to say he reached England?.

1039
02:23:10,137 --> 02:23:13,350
Maybe you'll find he actually went to
that fish shop and asked for that woman.

1040
02:23:15,303 --> 02:23:16,670
Maybe.

1041
02:27:25,711 --> 02:27:29,598
Нey, Conn. What's the matter?
You lose your sea legs?

1042
02:27:33,261 --> 02:27:36,008
Where the hell did you find
that record?

1043
02:27:44,272 --> 02:27:47,399
What have you been up to
all these years?

1044
02:27:53,531 --> 02:27:57,075
Making music.
- Even during the war?

1045
02:28:00,955 --> 02:28:04,691
Even when no-one
was dancing anymore.

1046
02:28:08,462 --> 02:28:10,781
Even when the bombs were falling.

1047
02:28:14,510 --> 02:28:17,629
The music helped them get better.

1048
02:28:19,181 --> 02:28:21,266
The wounded, I mean.

1049
02:28:25,321 --> 02:28:29,607
Or else it kept them entertained,

1050
02:28:30,826 --> 02:28:34,070
as they slipped into another world.

1051
02:28:36,699 --> 02:28:41,202
Sometimes they didn't even mind
the voyage,

1052
02:28:41,329 --> 02:28:44,047
if they could listen to the music.

1053
02:28:46,876 --> 02:28:50,128
Mine was the last face they saw.

1054
02:28:52,131 --> 02:28:56,903
And I kept playing
'til the ship got here.

1055
02:29:01,933 --> 02:29:04,017
Call this a ship?

1056
02:29:05,394 --> 02:29:09,004
It's more like a mountain
of dynamite about to explode.

1057
02:29:09,941 --> 02:29:12,425
A bit dangerous, don't you think?

1058
02:29:18,783 --> 02:29:20,659
And you, Max?

1059
02:29:22,328 --> 02:29:23,995
Where's your trumpet?

1060
02:29:26,749 --> 02:29:29,585
I gave it up as well, a while back.

1061
02:29:30,211 --> 02:29:34,381
But, you know, now I'm in the mood
for starting again.

1062
02:29:35,299 --> 02:29:38,426
I'm busting with new ideas.

1063
02:29:39,387 --> 02:29:42,514
Let's start a duo, you and me.

1064
02:29:43,391 --> 02:29:46,101
Or our own band:

1065
02:29:46,227 --> 02:29:52,273
the Danny Boodman
T.D. Lemon Nineteen Нundred Big Band!

1066
02:29:53,109 --> 02:29:56,653
It gets the blood going!
We'd be a smash!

1067
02:30:00,116 --> 02:30:03,522
Come on, Nineteen Hundred.
Come with me! Let's get off.

1067.5
02:30:03,996 --> 02:30:06,162
We'll watch the fireworks
from the pier!

1068
02:30:06,288 --> 02:30:08,999
And then we'll start from scratch.

1069
02:30:10,668 --> 02:30:16,297
Sometimes that's the way you have to
do it. Go right back to the beginning.

1070
02:30:27,935 --> 02:30:33,773
"You're never really done for
as long as you've got a good story"

1071
02:30:33,899 --> 02:30:38,111
"and someone to tell it to".
Remember?

1072
02:30:40,573 --> 02:30:42,866
You told me that.

1073
02:30:45,911 --> 02:30:49,573
Well, what a stack of
stories you've got now!

1074
02:30:50,499 --> 02:30:57,380
The world would hang on your every
word, they'd go mad for your music.

1075
02:31:00,593 --> 02:31:02,052
Believe me.

1076
02:31:08,142 --> 02:31:10,643
All that city...

1077
02:31:16,067 --> 02:31:19,194
You just couldn't see an end to it.

1078
02:31:20,738 --> 02:31:22,614
The end.

1079
02:31:23,449 --> 02:31:27,827
Please, could you please
show me where it ends?

1080
02:31:32,083 --> 02:31:35,126
It was all very fine
on that gangway

1081
02:31:35,377 --> 02:31:39,089
and I was grand, too,
in my overcoat.

1082
02:31:40,174 --> 02:31:43,343
I cut quite a figure

1083
02:31:43,469 --> 02:31:47,430
And I was getting off.
Guaranteed.

1084
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:52,185
There wasn't a problem.

1085
02:31:56,232 --> 02:31:59,359
It wasn't what I saw
that stopped me, Max.

1086
02:32:01,028 --> 02:32:05,806
It was what I didn't see.
Can you understand that?

1087
02:32:07,785 --> 02:32:10,495
What I didn't see.

1088
02:32:11,747 --> 02:32:15,997
In all that sprawling city,
there was everything except an end.

1089
02:32:18,087 --> 02:32:19,754
There was no end.

1090
02:32:20,341 --> 02:32:20,425

1091
02:32:22,552 --> 02:32:28,321
What I did not see was where
the whole thing came to an end.

1092
02:32:29,974 --> 02:32:32,024
The end of the world.

1093
02:32:40,175 --> 02:32:41,394
Take a piano.

1094
02:32:43,779 --> 02:32:47,115
The keys begin, the keys end.

1095
02:32:49,285 --> 02:32:53,454
You know there are 88 of them and
nobody can tell you any different.

1096
02:32:53,581 --> 02:32:57,742
They are not infinite,
you are infinite.

1097
02:32:59,336 --> 02:33:03,936
And on those keys the music
that you can make is infinite.

1098
02:33:05,676 --> 02:33:07,760
I like that.

1099
02:33:08,387 --> 02:33:10,257
That I can live by.

1100
02:33:10,723 --> 02:33:14,775
But you get me up on that gangway and
you roll out in front of me a keyboard

1101
02:33:14,812 --> 02:33:17,812
of millions of keys. Millions
and billions of keys that never end,

1102
02:33:17,938 --> 02:33:21,399
and that's the truth, Max,
that they never end...

1103
02:33:21,692 --> 02:33:23,702
That keyboard is infinite.

1104
02:33:25,529 --> 02:33:30,001
And if that keyboard is infinite, then
on it there's no music you can play!

1105
02:33:31,285 --> 02:33:33,202
You're sitting on the wrong bench!

1106
02:33:34,438 --> 02:33:36,074
That's God's piano.

1107
02:33:40,252 --> 02:33:45,048
Christ! Did you see the streets?
There were thousands of them!

1108
02:33:45,674 --> 02:33:49,219
How do you do it down there?
Нow do you choose just one?

1109
02:33:50,721 --> 02:33:54,390
One woman, one house,

1110
02:33:56,310 --> 02:34:00,480
one piece of land to call your own,
one landscape to look at,

1111
02:34:01,690 --> 02:34:04,067
one way to die.

1112
02:34:07,780 --> 02:34:12,367
All that world weighing down on you
without even knowing when it ends.

1113
02:34:12,493 --> 02:34:15,986
Aren't you ever just scared
of breaking apart

1114
02:34:16,112 --> 02:34:19,316
with the thought of it,
the enormity of living in it?

1115
02:34:23,679 --> 02:34:25,880
I was born on this ship.

1116
02:34:29,760 --> 02:34:36,524
The world passed me by,
but two thousand people at a time.

1117
02:34:38,644 --> 02:34:41,562
And there were wishes here,

1118
02:34:42,773 --> 02:34:44,558
but never more
than could fit

1119
02:34:44,643 --> 02:34:47,028
between the prow and the stern.

1120
02:34:49,571 --> 02:34:53,908
And you played out your happiness,
but on a piano that was not infinite!

1121
02:34:54,326 --> 02:34:57,620
I learned to live that way.

1122
02:35:01,166 --> 02:35:03,042
Land...

1123
02:35:05,045 --> 02:35:08,272
Land is a ship too big for me.

1124
02:35:11,051 --> 02:35:14,178
It's a woman too beautiful.

1125
02:35:15,597 --> 02:35:20,184
It's a voyage too long.
Perfume too strong.

1126
02:35:21,812 --> 02:35:24,939
It's music I don't know how to make.

1127
02:35:29,111 --> 02:35:32,030
I can never get off this ship.

1128
02:35:34,825 --> 02:35:39,137
At best, I can step off my life.

1129
02:35:41,823 --> 02:35:45,993
After all,
I don't exist for anyone.

1130
02:35:50,257 --> 02:35:53,176
You're the exception, Max.

1131
02:35:54,970 --> 02:35:57,999
You're the only one
who knows I'm here.

1132
02:36:00,768 --> 02:36:02,441
You're a minority.

1133
02:36:03,687 --> 02:36:06,564
You'd better get used to it.

1134
02:36:11,070 --> 02:36:13,780
Forgive me, my friend.

1135
02:36:15,032 --> 02:36:17,325
But I'm not getting off.

1136
02:37:47,374 --> 02:37:49,041
Нey, Max!

1137
02:37:51,420 --> 02:37:53,796
Picture the scenes going down.

1138
02:37:54,173 --> 02:37:58,092
Some guy searching a list trying
to find my name and not finding it!

1139
02:37:59,678 --> 02:38:03,014
"What did you say your name was?"
"Nineteen Нundred".

1140
02:38:04,475 --> 02:38:06,142
"Niemann, Nightingale,"

1141
02:38:06,268 --> 02:38:09,604
"Ninestock, Nittledeen".

1142
02:38:09,730 --> 02:38:15,193
"You see, sir, I was born on a ship".
"Beg your pardon?"

1143
02:38:15,319 --> 02:38:19,489
"Born, raised and died on a ship,
maybe I'm not registered there".

1144
02:38:20,949 --> 02:38:24,702
"Shipwreck?"
"No, six and a half tons of dynamite".

1145
02:38:26,955 --> 02:38:29,749
"Are you feeling better now?"

1146
02:38:29,875 --> 02:38:33,878
"Yeah, fine,
except that I lost an arm".

1147
02:38:34,922 --> 02:38:38,049
"An arm?"
"Yes, in the explosion".

1148
02:38:40,594 --> 02:38:43,304
"You should be able to
find one over there".

1149
02:38:44,640 --> 02:38:47,767
"Which one do you say is missing?"
"The left, sir".

1150
02:38:48,810 --> 02:38:52,438
"Oh, I'm dreadfully sorry!"

1151
02:38:52,981 --> 02:38:56,843
"We only seem to have two rights".

1152
02:38:57,569 --> 02:39:00,071
"Two right arms?"
"Yes".

1153
02:39:00,781 --> 02:39:02,240
"I'm afraid so".

1154
02:39:02,366 --> 02:39:06,410
"Would you mind awfully taking..."

1155
02:39:07,996 --> 02:39:13,000
"Taking what?"
"A right arm instead of a left".

1156
02:39:16,838 --> 02:39:22,051
"Well, all things considered, better
a right arm than nothing at all".

1157
02:39:22,678 --> 02:39:24,262
"Couldn't agree more".

1158
02:39:25,806 --> 02:39:30,685
"Incidentally, we have one
black arm and one white arm".

1159
02:39:30,811 --> 02:39:33,521
"Oh, no, matching colors, please".

1160
02:39:33,647 --> 02:39:38,776
"Nothing against any other race,
it's just a question of aesthetics!"

1161
02:39:42,739 --> 02:39:45,032
It's no laughing matter, Max.

1162
02:39:47,494 --> 02:39:51,789
What a cock-up,
spend eternity with two right arms!

1163
02:39:53,208 --> 02:39:55,542
Нow would you make
the sign of the cross?

1164
02:40:11,435 --> 02:40:13,102
Нey, Max!

1165
02:40:15,147 --> 02:40:18,074
Imagine the music I could play
with two right arms.

1166
02:40:19,401 --> 02:40:22,111
Hope I can find a piano up there!

1167
02:40:39,838 --> 02:40:41,922
Okay, that's fine like that. Slowly!

1168
02:40:42,049 --> 02:40:44,550
Slowly.
- Get hold of it there.

1169
02:42:17,993 --> 02:42:20,571
What would you have done
in my shoes?

1170
02:42:22,741 --> 02:42:24,525
I don't know.

1171
02:42:27,738 --> 02:42:31,490
I would probably
have felt quite useless.

1172
02:42:38,290 --> 02:42:43,502
Sooner or later all stories end,
and there's nothing else to add.

1173
02:42:48,800 --> 02:42:51,719
Anyhow, thanks, Pops.

1174
02:43:12,699 --> 02:43:14,033
Нey, Conn!

1175
02:43:15,997 --> 02:43:18,120
There's just one thing I don't get.

1176
02:43:19,164 --> 02:43:23,417
Who hid the broken record
inside the piano?

1177
02:43:26,804 --> 02:43:32,826
You're looking at him.
- So, you weren't useless after all.

1178
02:43:42,395 --> 02:43:43,854
Нey, Conn!

1179
02:43:48,026 --> 02:43:49,276
Here.

1180
02:43:53,198 --> 02:43:57,535
Take your trumpet.
You'll be needing it.

1181
02:44:00,497 --> 02:44:03,290
Never mind the money!

1182
02:44:03,583 --> 02:44:07,127
A good story is worth
more than an old trumpet.

1183
02:44:14,594 --> 02:44:16,387
Okay, Pops.

1184
02:45:13,111 --> 02:45:24,955
