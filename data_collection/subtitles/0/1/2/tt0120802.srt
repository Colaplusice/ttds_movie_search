1
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:14,580
Darling, come here.

2
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:19,980
Do you like it?

3
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,500
Justice...

4
00:03:31,100 --> 00:03:34,340
There will be a trial...

5
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:39,300
a great trial before a powerful magistrate.

6
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,180
And you, you will be guilty.

7
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:47,140
Beware! Beware the heat of the fire!

8
00:04:51,100 --> 00:04:56,460
Comrade Chan Gong has come from Beijing.

9
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,820
Welcome her, please.

10
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,340
Comrades, students, revolutionary

11
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,260
companions-in-arms...

12
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:19,580
I give you my proletarian salute.

13
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:28,100
I congratulate you on today's grand festival...

14
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,780
for which you have worked so hard.

15
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:34,980
Your cultural unit has done exceptional work.

16
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:43,380
I would also like to commend you

17
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:46,380
on the children's presentation.

18
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:48,300
It made my heart rejoice.

19
00:05:48,380 --> 00:05:49,860
The story of The Three Heroic Girls...

20
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:52,620
was a vivid lesson.

21
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:57,060
It galvanized our historic crusade!

22
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:03,540
But unfortunately, some efforts
are less successful.

23
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:11,380
Sometimes the teacher must learn
from his students.

24
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:15,620
Give it to me.

25
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:27,260
Capitalist exploitation survived
for centuries...

26
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:31,580
yet its "classics" are pitiful.

27
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:34,820
Foreign music is meaningless and empty.

28
00:06:34,860 --> 00:06:37,700
What do they mean by "symphony", "concerto"...

29
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,300
"No 1", "No 2", 'No 3"?

30
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,540
This is empty formalism.

31
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,300
It speaks nothing to the people.

32
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:47,420
What good is making music... except

33
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:51,020
to teach and inspire the people?

34
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,620
Long live Chairman Mao!

35
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:56,900
Overthrow the cultural establishment!

36
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,180
Chou Yuan?

37
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:03,180
Present.

38
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,740
Why do you teach this instrument?

39
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:12,060
Comrade Chan Gong, what you say is true...

40
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,580
Louder, please.

41
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,940
Comrade Chan Gong, you are right.

42
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:23,060
Much of Western music is unrefined, worthless.

43
00:07:23,620 --> 00:07:24,900
This is a fact.

44
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,940
Everything you said is true.

45
00:07:28,180 --> 00:07:29,860
But the music I teach...

46
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,420
Go on!

47
00:07:31,940 --> 00:07:34,700
The music I teach is revolutionary music.

48
00:07:35,180 --> 00:07:37,140
Beethoven, Prokofiev.

49
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:38,660
Do you think so?

50
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,500
In his speech, Comrade Li said...

51
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,980
Comrade Li was purged and humiliated.

52
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:47,140
Do you still wish to quote him?

53
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:50,100
I didn't know.

54
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:53,860
I have taught for many years.

55
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,420
That is apparent.

56
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:58,260
We believe in the rule of many voices.

57
00:07:58,460 --> 00:08:00,780
What should we do here?

58
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,660
Throw away that old junk!

59
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:04,980
Chou Yuan, you must admit your guilt.

60
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:07,500
Let's challenge degenerate Western art!

61
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,820
Comrade, may I say a few words?

62
00:08:13,540 --> 00:08:14,980
Of course.

63
00:08:16,500 --> 00:08:21,420
Students, comrades, revolutionary Red Guards...

64
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,140
I'm not an authority on foreign music.

65
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:27,700
I have not studied like Comrade Chan Gong.

66
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,580
But in my opinion, there's nothing

67
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,780
as beautiful as our traditional music.

68
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,860
Chou Yuan also teaches the hu chin.

69
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,460
Could he not focus on that?

70
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:50,980
Comrade Xiang has shown her wisdom.

71
00:08:57,220 --> 00:09:01,660
Put this down with the other "great olds"!

72
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:13,420
To every problem there is a solution!

73
00:09:13,580 --> 00:09:16,420
I'm sure you can discover the problems.

74
00:09:16,460 --> 00:09:19,060
And I'm sure you can solve them.

75
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:10,860
Who is it? Who's there?

76
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,780
Ming!

77
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:20,940
You scared me. I didn't hear you.

78
00:12:30,020 --> 00:12:32,780
It's a mess. I was tidying up.

79
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,300
What's that?

80
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:38,660
This is a violin.

81
00:12:39,660 --> 00:12:41,820
A musical instrument from Europe.

82
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,420
From Europe?

83
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,020
Is it a bad thing?

84
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:49,500
No, a violin itself is a good thing.

85
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:51,700
Here, take a look

86
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,140
We have to study foreign music

87
00:12:57,460 --> 00:12:59,340
so we can move on...

88
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:00,580
as Chairman Mao said.

89
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:02,860
Dad asked if you're coming.

90
00:13:02,980 --> 00:13:04,100
He's waiting.

91
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:07,620
Yes. Tell him I'll come to see him right away.

92
00:13:07,740 --> 00:13:09,340
As soon as I finish my work.

93
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:15,020
- Ming?
- Yes?

94
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:20,900
What you see here, don't tell anyone.

95
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,140
I want you to listen.

96
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:23,780
This will be our secret, all right?

97
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:30,180
Go!

98
00:14:54,980 --> 00:14:57,820
Ming!

99
00:14:59,260 --> 00:15:00,740
- Was she home?
- Yes.

100
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:01,860
Is she coming?

101
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:04,180
No, she said she'd meet you.

102
00:15:04,420 --> 00:15:07,020
What? Is she coming or not?

103
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:08,300
I can't say why.

104
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,340
Why what?

105
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,340
I promised her to keep it secret.

106
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:13,060
What are you saying?

107
00:15:13,100 --> 00:15:16,420
I'm your father. You must tell me everything.

108
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:24,980
- Xiang Pei!
- Papa, don't!

109
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:26,740
Open up, it's me.

110
00:15:27,980 --> 00:15:29,060
Where's the key?

111
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:31,420
Go!

112
00:15:40,980 --> 00:15:42,660
Quiet!

113
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,460
Where is she?

114
00:15:57,900 --> 00:15:59,660
Water! Water!

115
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,660
She's gone.

116
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:51,060
Is this her?

117
00:16:57,140 --> 00:17:00,060
Look at the date: 1937. It must be her mother.

118
00:17:21,700 --> 00:17:25,540
Chou Yuan!

119
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,660
- What do you want?
- Please let me in.

120
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,500
I've done nothing.

121
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,020
Let me inside.

122
00:17:55,580 --> 00:17:56,700
This is for you.

123
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:58,820
I don't want it.

124
00:18:08,020 --> 00:18:10,420
It's for you. Take it.

125
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:15,980
It's a violin. A violin.

126
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,380
I remember.

127
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,860
Do you want it or not?

128
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:25,300
I'm an old man, but I'm not a fool.

129
00:18:26,020 --> 00:18:27,420
Where are your comrades?

130
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,380
Are they waiting outside?

131
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:31,140
This isn't a trap.

132
00:18:31,780 --> 00:18:33,020
I've changed.

133
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,340
I don't need it now. I speak from my heart.

134
00:18:35,620 --> 00:18:37,140
Enough!

135
00:18:39,660 --> 00:18:41,100
And I don't need this.

136
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:44,260
It's from another time.

137
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:49,300
If you want it, you can have it,

138
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:52,300
or else no one will.

139
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,580
Do you want it or not?

140
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,980
I've no time!

141
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:03,500
No more arguments.

142
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:12,420
Take it! I am a cadre in the Party.

143
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,580
Do you understand?

144
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:17,220
I can't keep it.

145
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:21,420
I love the people. Do you understand?

146
00:19:36,140 --> 00:19:37,380
Xiang Pei!

147
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:42,900
I will keep it safe.

148
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:53,780
Let's go eat, I'm starving.

149
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,580
Go ahead. I'll wait here.

150
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:58,420
I'm sure she'll be back.

151
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,180
The last card.

152
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,940
The last card.

153
00:21:23,820 --> 00:21:25,060
Oh, my God!

154
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:28,580
Courage, madame... Upside down.

155
00:21:28,780 --> 00:21:31,500
At this point in the spread...

156
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,700
it might be good news.

157
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,620
I feel... I feel the fast air

158
00:21:39,660 --> 00:21:42,060
sweeping around you...

159
00:21:42,380 --> 00:21:46,620
carrying you... furious wind...

160
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,020
and then stopping.

161
00:21:57,020 --> 00:22:00,860
Your journey will end. No question. I see it.

162
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:05,460
One way or another, your travels are over.

163
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:13,380
And there is trouble in this like always.

164
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:19,540
But you... you are strong by now...

165
00:22:19,820 --> 00:22:22,900
strong like a tree in the forest.

166
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,580
Where is he?

167
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:26,820
Upstairs.

168
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:35,580
You are not alone.

169
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:39,780
A crowd of forces, friends and family...

170
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:41,900
enemies, lovers...

171
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:46,260
You will attract many admirers...

172
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:48,260
fighting to win your hand.

173
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:53,100
And money... lots of money.

174
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:57,380
No, madame. Don't be afraid.

175
00:22:58,220 --> 00:23:05,660
N this card, I see a rebirth.

176
00:23:29,420 --> 00:23:31,260
This is Mr. Morritz. You know...

177
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:35,220
So you're the expert?

178
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,460
From New York.

179
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,220
Do you know what you're doing?

180
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:58,820
316-2799

181
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:35,100
"With all my heart"

182
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:10,540
RED VIOLIN UNEARTHED

183
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:21,900
Ladies and gentlemen

184
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:26,140
Duval's would like to welcome you
to this eagerly awaited event.

185
00:44:26,220 --> 00:44:28,580
Our thanks to the government of China...

186
00:44:28,660 --> 00:44:32,940
for entrusting us with this
marvelous collection.

187
00:44:33,020 --> 00:44:37,860
Thanks too to Madame Leroux who
organized and made possible this auction.

Let me remind you that the conditions
of sale are listed in the catalog.

189
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:01,140
Wait!

190
00:48:02,340 --> 00:48:03,300
The tag!

191
00:48:09,780 --> 00:48:11,340
I put the tag on myself.

192
00:48:13,780 --> 00:48:14,860
Too late.

193
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,500
Call security.

194
00:51:45,660 --> 00:51:48,500
Madame? Are you all right?

195
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:51,460
Is everything all right?

Yes, I'm sorry.

197
00:51:59,140 --> 00:52:01,020
You have the visions.

198
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,420
No. I'd better go now.

199
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:07,860
My husband...

200
00:52:09,380 --> 00:52:12,020
Of course, go to your husband.
