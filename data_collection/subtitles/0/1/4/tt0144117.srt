{585}{699}Our Father, who art in heaven,|hallowed be Thy name.
{701}{778}Thy kingdom come,|Thy will be done,
{780}{859}on earth|as it is in heaven.
{861}{928}Give us this day|our daily bread,
{929}{983}and forgive us|our trespasses,
{985}{1083}as we forgive those|who trespass against us.
{1085}{1160}And lead us|not into temptation,
{1162}{1232}but deliver us from evil.
{1233}{1316}For Thine is the kingdom,|the power...
{1317}{1421}and the glory|now and forever.
{1423}{1469}- Amen.|- Amen.
{1561}{1607}Thank you, Father Macklepenny,
{1609}{1718}for coming all the way|across town to be our guest speaker.
{1720}{1769}When I raise my flashing sword...
{1816}{1878}and my hand|takes hold on judgment,
{1937}{1995}I will take vengeance|up on mine enemies.
{2035}{2090}And I will repay those|who haze me.
{2125}{2197}O Lord, raise me|to Thy right hand...
{2199}{2255}and count me|among Thy saints.
{2391}{2456}And I am reminded|on this holy day...
{2494}{2585}of the sad story|of Kitty Genovese.
{2650}{2745}As you all may remember,
{2746}{2820}a long time ago,|almost 30 years ago,
{2821}{2921}this poor soul|cried out for help...
{2923}{2984}time and time again,
{2986}{3080}but no person|answer her calls.
{3122}{3176}Though many saw,
{3177}{3248}no one so much|as called the police.
{3290}{3391}They all just watched as Kitty|was being stabbed to death...
{3421}{3478}in broad daylight.
{3480}{3591}They watched as|her assailant walked away.
{3641}{3752}Now, we must all fear|evil men.
{3798}{3876}But there is|another kind of evil...
{3878}{3942}which we must fear most,
{3993}{4083}and that is|the indifference...
{4085}{4164}of good men!
{4637}{4712}I do believe the monsignor's|finally got the point.
{4713}{4760}Aye.
{5588}{5634}Hey, Connor!
{5831}{5879}What?
{6141}{6198}Yeah!|Who's the master?
{6362}{6409}You're gonna be|training her today.
{6410}{6472}Aye.
{6645}{6723}- Basically, the rule of thumb here is--|- Wait. Rule of thumb?
{6900}{6993}In the early 1900s, it was legal|for men to beat their wives...
{6995}{7073}as long as they used a stick|no wider than their thumb.
{7231}{7278}Can't do much damage|with that then, can we?
{7280}{7326}Perhaps it should've been|the ""rule of wrist.''
{7453}{7503}I knew you two pricks|would give me problems.
{7505}{7568}Come on. It's St. Patty's Day.|It's all in good fun.
{7570}{7617}Ah, fuck you!|And fuck you too!
{7650}{7716}We're sorry, all right?|Just-Just relax.
{7793}{7844}Oh, shit.
{9254}{9301}Hey, fuck-ass,|give me a beer.
{9565}{9652}Listen, boys, I've got|some very bad news.
{9654}{9751}I'm gonna have to|close down t-t-the bar.
{9753}{9872}The Russians are buying up buildings|all over the town, includin' this one.
{9874}{9928}Fuck! Ass!
{9930}{9992}And they're not lettin' me|renew my lease.
{9993}{10062}- Let me talk to my boss.
{10064}{10155}- Maybe he can do something.|- What the fuck's your boss gonna do?
{10157}{10225}Listen, fellas,|I don't want anyone to know.
{10226}{10276}Soyou keep your traps shut!
{10278}{10397}You know what they say:|People in glass houses sink s-s-ships.
{10485}{10561}Hey, Doc, I gotta buy you,|like, a proverb book or somethin'.
{10563}{10624}This mix-and-match shit|has gotta go.
{10625}{10659}- What?
{10661}{10716}A penny saved is worth|two in the bush, isn't it?
{10717}{10798}And don't cross the road|ifyou can't get out ofthe kitchen.
{10989}{11035}What's this, then?
{11037}{11158}I am Ivan Checkov,|and you will be closing now.
{11301}{11350}Checkov.
{11352}{11481}Well, this here's McCoy.|We find a Spock,|we've got us an away team.
{11543}{11616}Me in no mood for discussion.|You, you stay.
{11617}{11684}The rest of you,|go now.
{11685}{11781}Why don't you make like a tree|and get the fuck out of here!
{11886}{11933}You know he's got|till the week's end, right?
{11934}{11992}You don't have to be|hard-asses, doya?
{11993}{12057}- It's St. Patty's Day.|Everyone's Irish tonight.|- Mmm.
{12059}{12113}Why don't you just|pull up a stool|and have a drink with us?
{12115}{12176}- This is no game! If you won't go,
{12177}{12240}we will make you go.
{12662}{12739}So these two guys are kickin'|the shit out of each other, right?
{12741}{12810}This guy picks up|an old kitchen sink or something...
{12812}{12867}and fuckin' crushes|this guy with it.
{12869}{12944}It makes a big bang.
{13507}{13585}Look at him. His spine's all crushed.|Had to be one big motherfucker.
{13587}{13684}Huge. Three, four hundred pounds.|Fuckin' huge.
{13685}{13743}- That's pretty thin.|- Very thin.
{13872}{13929}Okay.|Allright, allright.
{13930}{13992}Say these two guys right here,|they don't even know|the fuckin' huge guy.
{13993}{14068}They're just staggering home|from a bar still all fucked up|from St. Patty's last night.
{14070}{14134}They decide to take a shortcut|down through the alley.
{14136}{14189}Wrong fuckin' alley, huh?
{14191}{14246}'Cause this big motherfucker,|he's just waitin' for 'em, right?
{14248}{14337}And what could be more perfect|for a strong-arm robbery?|Two drunk guys all bandaged up.
{14339}{14399}They're already injured,|for Christ's sakes. Lookat 'em.
{14401}{14482}These guys are stumblin'|through the alley.| Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-la
{14484}{14541}This guy takes a blunt object,|fuckin'-- Waah!
{14542}{14621}Hits the guy with the bandages|around his head, right?|Why? 'Cause he's smart.
{14623}{14700}He knows the guy with|the band age around his ass,|he ain't goin' nowhere.
{14702}{14765}He's goin' fuckin' nowhere!
{14767}{14837}Where are you goin'?|Nowhere! That's right.
{14897}{14959}He ain't done yet.|He comes over and jumps|on this guy's back...
{14961}{15007}and crushes him to death.
{15045}{15099}I feel something big here.
{15101}{15153}I wouldn't be surprised to see|a lot of these turnin' up.
{15155}{15201}Brilliant!
{15203}{15278}So now we got|a huge guy theory...
{15280}{15339}and a serial crusher theory.
{15341}{15391}Top notch.
{15393}{15447}- What's your name?|- Detective Greenly.
{15449}{15549}- Who the fuck are you?|- That's who the fuck I am.
{15551}{15633}Listen, I gotta do this|by the numbers.
{15634}{15701}I.D. just came back|on these guys.
{15703}{15755}They got connections|with the Russian mob.
{15757}{15824}That makes it|a federal matter.
{15825}{15933}And Agent Smecker here|is heading up the investigation|with our full cooperation.
{15935}{16012}- Why don'tyou get me a cup of coffee?|- Who the hell is this?
{16014}{16064}- A cafe latte, twist of lemon,|- What the fuck--
{16065}{16145}- Chief, what the fuck is this?|- Sweet 'N Low.
{19438}{19488}- Mitchell, Langley!
{19489}{19562}- Yes, sir.|- Find the manager of this building.
{19564}{19634}See if he's had any complaints|of water coming down...
{19636}{19688}in any of the apartments|starting just this morning.
{19690}{19754}Langley, you take that building.|Same thing.
{19785}{19842}Chaffey! Newman!
{19844}{19920}- Yes, sir.|- Look in the trash around their hands.
{19922}{19993}See if you can fnd me|two bullet casings,
{19994}{20041}fifty-caliber|if my eyes serve me right.
{20080}{20160}Newman,|rip through this shit.
{20161}{20219}If this was a sink,
{20221}{20267}find me some metal parts.
{20269}{20353}Give me a drain cover,|faucet or something.
{20406}{20453}Got it right here.|It's a 50-cal.
{20455}{20527}Chief, can you get|ballistics down here...
{20529}{20593}and tell 'em they have to dig|a 50-caliber slug...
{20595}{20665}out of a brickwall|and locate another that's been|fred through a Dumpster?
{20666}{20713}We have the best|ballistics guy in the world.
{20714}{20779}- I can have him here in ten minutes.|- How did you know that?
{20781}{20829}Liquid paraffn.
{20831}{20886}Came up positive.
{20888}{20944}And bullet holes|are usually a big clue.
{20945}{21000}Nobody reported|any gunshots.
{21001}{21084}This is an Irish neighborhood.|I'm surprised you even got a phone call.
{21086}{21152}You know, I can't find|these condone, sir.
{21154}{21201}Look under the body.
{21278}{21335}Oh, yeah, there it is.
{21386}{21439}You guys ready for this?
{21441}{21519}This was no|gangland assassination.
{21521}{21584}Though creative,|it was way too sloppy.
{21585}{21665}Something went wrong here.|This has ""personal'' written all over it.
{21667}{21747}Agent Smecker.|Yeah, this is all illegal loft housing.
{21749}{21816}There's no manager on|the premises, but they found|a lady on the fourth floor...
{21817}{21870}who said she had water dripping|down on her whole place.
{21872}{21924}- It started just this morning.|- Fourth floor, huh?
{21926}{21973}Mm-hmm.
{22003}{22049}Then we're headin'|to the fifth.
{22051}{22124}Come on. Let's get out of here.|You're reachin; man.
{22125}{22185}- It's a theory.|- I don't know. No way.
{22187}{22257}You know how big a guy's|gotta be to do that? Fuckin' huge.
{22258}{22360}Oh, really? I might just be|wantin' a bagel with my coffee.
{22521}{22569}I ain't gettin' him|no fuckin' bagel.
{22786}{22840}We'll start the ass kissing|with you.
{22946}{23005}Agent Smecker.|Agent--
{23006}{23051}Listen, I know this neighborhood|pretty good.
{23053}{23099}There's a bar down the block|named McGinty's.
{23101}{23164}- It stands a good chance|they were there last night.|- Good work, Mitchell.
{23166}{23228}I'll check it out myself.
{23229}{23296}Lookat the ceiling.|Sensey our touch alone.
{23297}{23347}Wait until you feel me move.|Ooh.
{23349}{23412}So quick you couldn't|even feel it go, could you?
{23414}{23487}Let's try it again.|Try it again. Look at the ceiling.
{23489}{23535}It's Doc.
{23591}{23679}- Thanks for comin', Doc.|- Jesus Christ!
{23681}{23761}What the fuck happened?|Are-Are you b-b-boys all right?
{23763}{23845}- We're alive.|- An F.B.I. agent came by the bar...
{23846}{23893}and he left me|his c-c-ca--
{23894}{23977}He left me his c-c--|Oh, he fuckin' gave me this.|Fuck!
{23979}{24035}- Ass! What are you gonna do?
{24037}{24096}We oughta turn ourselves in,|tell him it was self-defense.
{24098}{24143}Yeah, yeah, yeah.|That's what he said.
{24145}{24199}- How the fuck's he know that?|We haven't spoken to anyone.|- D-D-Don't know.
{24201}{24264}He d-d-didn't say.
{24265}{24327}All right. Listen, Doc,|we need you to do us a favor.
{24329}{24392}- A-A-Anything.|-Just hold on to this for us.
{24393}{24444}- We're gonna come back for it|when we get out.|- Right.
{24446}{24491}Fuck! Ass!
{24545}{24633}None of that cursing|was directed at you.|He's-- He's a bit--
{24729}{24776}First of all,
{24777}{24852}I'd like to thank|which ever one of you...
{24853}{24929}doughnut-munching,|barrel-assed,
{24931}{25020}pud-pulling sissies|leaked this to the press.
{25050}{25097}That's just|what we need now--
{25099}{25148}some sensational story|in the papers...
{25149}{25268}making these boys out to be|superheroes triumphing over evil.
{25270}{25339}Let me squash|the rumors now.
{25341}{25404}These two are not heroes.
{25445}{25501}They're just|two ordinary men...
{25503}{25592}who were put in|an extraordinary situation,
{25594}{25651}and they just happened|to come out on top.
{25653}{25748}Yes, nothing from our|far-reaching computer system...
{25749}{25796}has turned up diddly|on these two.
{25797}{25855}All we know is what|we found out from the neighbors.
{25857}{25903}And the general consensus is,
{25969}{26015}they're angels.
{26081}{26148}But angels don't kill.
{26149}{26213}And we got|two bodies in the morgue...
{26215}{26272}that look like they've been|serial-crushed...
{26273}{26363}by some huge, friggin' guy.
{26365}{26436}Are we considering these guys|armed and dangerous?
{26437}{26485}Well, not armed.
{26486}{26572}If they had guns,|they would've used them.|But dangerous? Very.
{26573}{26620}Now, what makes you think|they're dangerous?
{26621}{26681}- Maybe they're just|protectin' each other.
{26793}{26877}Hey, look, I-I-I'm not sayin'|one way or the other.
{26879}{26977}Just be careful and go|by the protocol on this.
{26979}{27060}It's grunt police work|that's gonna bring this one in.
{27061}{27128}These guys are|miles away by now.
{27129}{27208}But if you wanna beat your head|against the wall, then|here's what you're lookin'for.
{27209}{27264}They're scared, like|two little bunny rabbits.
{27266}{27336}Anything in a uniform|or flashing blue lights|is gonna spook 'em.
{27337}{27433}Okay? So the only thing we can do|is put a potato on a string...
{27435}{27481}and drag it through|South Boston.
{27483}{27544}- Thanks for comin' out.
{27546}{27611}You'd probably have|better luckwith a beer.
{27645}{27687}You would.
{27689}{27757}- Oh, fuck.|- Hey, Greenly.
{27759}{27832}Onion bagel, cream cheese.
{28127}{28224}This conversation|is going to be recorded.
{28225}{28280}Just answer to|the best of your knowledge.
{28281}{28341}Excuse me, sir.|Please.
{28621}{28680}Okay, we're ready.
{28718}{28808}You boys are not under oath here.|Just answer the questions.
{28809}{28864}I'm assuming...
{28865}{28913}you knew these guys|from before, huh?
{28993}{29073}We met them last night.
{29075}{29143}They had some|pretty interesting bandages.
{29145}{29191}Know anything about that?
{29278}{29337}Listen, if you want to fght,|you can see you're out numbered here.
{29338}{29385}We're trying to be civil,|so I suggest you take our offer.
{29387}{29441}I make the offers.
{29443}{29492}Hey, Boris.
{29545}{29598}What would you do...
{29600}{29651}if I told you...
{29653}{29724}-your pinko Commie mother|sucks so much dick,
{29725}{29787}her face looks like an egg?
{29789}{29816}- Fuck you!|- What are you doin'?
{30493}{30540}Stay away!|He can take care of himself!.
{31205}{31272}Freeze,|you fuckin' Irish faggots!
{31273}{31344}Get the fuck up!
{31345}{31400}- Come on!|- Get your fuckin' hands off of me!
{31433}{31510}Cuff yourself around the back!|Cuff yourself!.
{31512}{31572}Cuff it!
{31629}{31690}You know why|I fucking come here?
{31692}{31747}I come here to kill you.
{31749}{31848}But now, I no think|I fucking kill you.
{31850}{31897}I kill your brother.
{31898}{31947}Shoot him in the head.
{31985}{32033}- Fuck you!|- Gotta go.
{32035}{32091}Connor!
{32093}{32159}It was just a fuckin' bar fight!|You guys are fuckin' pussies!
{33471}{33556}I hope your conscience|is clear, Irishman.
{35291}{35352}So, how is it...
{35353}{35444}- that you guys are fluent in Russian?|- We paid attention in school.
{35446}{35500}Do you speak|any other languages?
{35502}{35583}- Aye. Our mother insisted on it.|- French?
{35679}{35725}Oh, that's beautiful.
{35823}{35897}- What's that?|- It's Italian.
{36075}{36121}- Jawohl.
{36215}{36297}What are you guys doin' workin'|at a friggin' meat packing plant?
{36337}{36396}- Uh, Agent Smecker?|The press is everywhere.|- Yeah.
{36397}{36495}They're just goin' nuts for these guys.|I don't know what you wanna do.
{36497}{36561}You're not being charged.|It's up to you. You wanna talk to 'em?
{36563}{36621}- Absolutely not.|- No pictures either.
{36623}{36679}Is there anyway|that we could stay here?
{36681}{36776}Uh, yeah. You know,|we have an extra holding cell|you guys can--
{36778}{36862}- Can they stay?|- Well, we'll have|to check with your mom.
{36901}{36975}But it's okay with me|if your friends sleep over.
{37035}{37097}Time to feed the dogs.
{37163}{37218}Okay, people.|Okay.
{37220}{37292}This is our|offcial statement.
{37293}{37384}The MacManus brothers|are not being charged|with a crime.
{37386}{37448}This is a clear-cut case|of self-defense.
{37449}{37507}They are being released|at an undisclosed|time and location...
{37509}{37555}in accordance with|their wishes.
{37557}{37624}- Do the MacManus brothers|have any priors?|- Can we speak to the brothers?
{37794}{37841}- Hey, Rocco, how you doin'?|- Hey!
{37891}{37954}Yeah!
{38066}{38113}What have you got there?
{38114}{38180}- Ahh.|- Very nice.
{38265}{38312}This poor soul...
{38313}{38360}cried out for help.
{38361}{38441}They watched as|he simply walked away.
{38443}{38508}Indifference of good men!
{38510}{38581}Nobody wanted to get involved.
{38582}{38620}Nobody
{38621}{38700}- Who so ever shed my blood,
{38701}{38793}by man shall his blood|be shed.
{38795}{38902}For in the image of God|may deem a man.
{38904}{38951}Destroy all that|which is evil.
{38953}{39012}So that which is good|may flourish.
{39849}{39896}What the fuck is that?
{39941}{40008}It's that fuckin'|Russian's pager.
{40040}{40086}Let's go.
{40357}{40409}How are ya?
{40411}{40468}- Keep the faith, man.|- Fuckin' blow me.
{40469}{40553}- What was that?|Have you got a pen?|- Yeah. Here you go.
{40555}{40608}- Thanks. Be right back.|- Good morning, son. How are ya?
{40609}{40679}- Good morning.|- We'd be honored if you would join us.
{40757}{40836}- See this?|- What's this?
{40837}{40884}Saints?
{40998}{41045}Body of Christ.|Body of Christ.
{41475}{41521}Amen.
{41638}{41711}That's not funny, man.|Give it here, package boy.
{41713}{41787}Joey Beevo said it was important.|Said to give it to him myself.
{41789}{41857}Give me the fuckin' thing.
{41902}{41956}Sit the fuck down.
{42231}{42307}So, I'm Rocco.|I'm the funny man.
{42381}{42427}I'm so fuckin' funny.
{42429}{42496}- Fuck you, Vincenzo.|- Uh-huh.
{42497}{42555}How did you get|that shiner on your eye?
{42557}{42604}What's the matter, someone|didn't think you were very funny?
{42714}{42761}I caught your show at|the Velvet Room at the Holiday Inn.
{42762}{42831}Loved it when you busted into|""Viva Las Vegas.''
{42833}{42896}- Hey, hey, hey
{43023}{43093}You insignifcant little fuck!
{43094}{43193}I always get my money,|you cock sucking bastardo!
{43353}{43399}The '90s are killing me.
{43401}{43447}I shouldn't have done that.
{43449}{43509}You're not supposed to tell a guy|you're gonna kill him no more.
{43511}{43591}I gotta tip to through the tulips|with these assholes.
{43593}{43673}Taking all the fun|out of the job.
{43817}{43863}Pappa Joe,|you want me to go now?
{43927}{44003}All the boys tell me|how you make them laugh|when you come around.
{44005}{44073}What a crack up you are.|What do they call you?
{44075}{44126}Uh, the--
{44128}{44188}The-The funny man.
{44189}{44236}The funny man.
{44237}{44320}I'm having a shitty day.|I'm depressed.
{44321}{44389}Tell me a funny joke.
{44391}{44452}Now?
{44453}{44501}A joke? Uh--
{44503}{44561}Um, uh, a joke.|Yeah, allright.
{44562}{44648}Um, there's these, uh,|three guys--
{44649}{44703}a-a-a spic,
{44705}{44776}a-a-a white guy|and a black guy.
{44777}{44839}- Nigger!|- Yeah.
{44841}{44897}N-N-- Yeah.|And they're walkin'|along the beach.
{44899}{44967}They see this pot.|They rub it,|a genie comes out.
{44969}{45088}Genie says you can wish for|anything you want. He asks|the Mexican what he wants.
{45090}{45137}And he goes,
{45138}{45257}""I want all my people in America|to be happy and free in Mexico.''
{45258}{45365}So the genie-- Poof!.|And all the spics|are in Mexico.
{45366}{45425}- And then he asks the black guy--|- Nigger.
{45426}{45484}Yeah, that's what I said.
{45485}{45551}He goes to the nigger,|says, ""What do you want?''
{45553}{45599}And he goes,
{45601}{45669}""I want all my African--
{45671}{45714}""my nigger brothers|in America...
{45716}{45812}to be back in Africa|and happy and everything.''
{45814}{45864}So the genie goes poof!.
{45866}{45928}And, um, all the niggers|in America...
{45929}{45992}are in Africa.
{45994}{46049}And this is goin'--|I'm not funny today.
{46051}{46121}I know. I'm havin' a hard day.|I-I-- This joke sucks.
{46123}{46181}It's just a stupid joke.
{46280}{46328}Continue the joke.
{46434}{46510}So the genie|says to the white guy,
{46512}{46563}""What's your one wish?''
{46565}{46614}And the white guy goes,|""You mean to tell me...
{46616}{46669}all the niggers and spics|are out of America?''
{46671}{46720}The genie goes, ""Yeah.''|He says,
{46722}{46769}"" Well, um,|I'll have a Coke then.''
{47317}{47363}"I'll have a Coke..."
{47365}{47419}Yeah.|Everybody's out,
{47421}{47513}so he just wants a Coke,|'cause that's all he needs.
{47587}{47669}- Tell me one more.|- What?
{48110}{48157}Knock your selves out.
{48735}{48781}Fuckin' hell.
{49140}{49224}- Do you know what|we need, man? Some rope.|- Absolutely.
{49226}{49297}- What are ya, insane?|- No, it ain't.
{49299}{49352}Charlie Bronson's|always got rope.
{49354}{49416}- What?|- Yeah.
{49418}{49484}He's got a lot of rope strapped|around him in the movies,|and they always end up using it.
{49485}{49578}- You've lost it, haven't it?|- No, I'm serious.
{49580}{49649}That's stupid. Name one thing|you'd need a rope for.
{49650}{49716}You don't fuckin' know|what you're gonna need it for.|They just always need it.
{49746}{49829}What's this ""they'' shit ?|This isn't a movie.
{49913}{49964}Oh. Right.
{50111}{50157}Is that right, Rambo?
{50253}{50335}All right.|Get your stupid fuckin' rope.
{50337}{50396}I'll get my stupid rope.
{50398}{50445}I'll get it.
{50477}{50525}There's rope right there.
{51347}{51393}You nervous?
{51425}{51503}- A bit.|- Myself as well.
{51801}{51848}Hello?
{51917}{51964}Uh-huh.|Room number?
{51997}{52045}Have we got|a time of death?
{52113}{52160}- We got a body count?
{52229}{52296}- Uh-huh. I'll be down there in a bit.
{52298}{52374}Keep the press out.
{52376}{52444}- What are you doin'?|- I just wanted to cuddle.
{52445}{52508}Cuddle?|What a fag.
{52777}{52823}Ooh.
{52825}{52881}This is a fucking|slaughter house.
{53099}{53193}- How many bodies, Greenly?|- Eight.
{53195}{53276}Aw, shit.|I forgot about that one.|Nine. Nine?
{53277}{53349}While Greenly's out gettin' coffee,|any body else want anything?
{53350}{53413}Shit!
{53415}{53468}So, Duffy,
{53470}{53563}you got any theories|to go with that tie?
{53602}{53691}Look, fuck all|these other guys.
{53693}{53749}This was their target--|the fag man.
{53751}{53809}The what man?
{53811}{53887}The fat man.
{53889}{53941}Well, Freud was right.
{53943}{54037}So you think they came|for the fag man, huh?
{54039}{54099}What do you base this about
{54101}{54165}He was the only one done right.|Double tap back of the head.
{54167}{54228}- And the pennies?|- New hit man wants to leave his mark.
{54230}{54277}That's a possibility.
{54279}{54375}Now you Irish cops|are perkin'up.
{54377}{54423}That's two sound theories|in one day,
{54425}{54496}neither of which deal|with abnormally-sized men.
{54497}{54552}Kind of makes me feel|like River dancing.
{54670}{54768}An other possibility is|they were placed there|with religious intent.
{54769}{54865}Okay, some cultures still|put pennies in the eyes|of the dead. Or silver.
{54867}{54927}The Italians, the Greeks.
{54929}{54988}Sicilians.
{54989}{55063}So, what's|the ""symbology'' there?
{55065}{55131}The ""symbology''?
{55133}{55213}Now that Duffy has relinquished|his King Bonehead crown,
{55215}{55261}I see we have an heir|to the thrown.
{55263}{55352}I'm sure the word you were|looking forwas ""symbolism.''|What is the symbolism there.
{55396}{55464}Let me explain it toyou.
{55465}{55520}In Greek and Roman mythology,
{55521}{55612}when you died, you'd have|to pay the toll to Charon,
{55613}{55696}the boatman who ferried you|across to the Gates of Judgment.
{55697}{55761}This made sure the dead|came to at one for what they did|during their lives,
{55763}{55809}Detective Alapopskalius.
{55811}{55866}Jesus. You're the frst one|that ever got that.
{55868}{55964}Yeah, well, I'm an expert|in nameology.
{56058}{56121}These burns indicate|that they used silencers.
{56157}{56225}Look at these|entry and exit wounds.
{56227}{56273}They're almost identical.
{56314}{56391}The two bullets went in here|through the top of the skull,
{56393}{56461}crisscrossed, and exited|through the eyeballs.
{56463}{56532}This one clue tells us|three distinct facts.
{56533}{56611}- Number one. Duffy?|- They shot him at a downward angle.
{56613}{56739}- They put him on his knees?|- Excellent. Number two. Greenly.
{56741}{56819}They shot him|at a downward angle?
{56914}{56969}It tells us|he was the last to die.
{57014}{57061}And number three.|Dolly.
{57063}{57109}There was two shooters.
{57111}{57175}- Fan-freakin'-tastic.|- Hey, wait a minute.
{57177}{57237}Stay with me, boys.|What did they do...
{57239}{57285}to make two such|identical wounds?
{57287}{57360}Two men of similar height|dropped this guy down.
{57361}{57467}Each puts some iron|to his head and boom!|That's all she frickin' wrote.
{57469}{57541}- What about one guy, two guns?|- Ah, possible.
{57543}{57606}But unlikely.|The angles are too extreme.
{57608}{57689}A guy holding two guns|to the back of your noodle is|going to shoot straight ahead.
{57691}{57737}He wouldn't cock out his elbows.|It makes no sense.
{57739}{57842}Besides, are you telling me|one guy came in here...
{57844}{57939}and killed eight men with eight|extremely well-aimed shots|in just a few seconds?
{57941}{58003}No way.|It had to be at least two.
{58119}{58165}You and your fuckin' rope.
{58447}{58529}- I told you there would be a shaft.|-Just like on television.
{59101}{59147}Fuck.
{59790}{59850}Where the fuck|are you goin'?
{59852}{59919}Shh! I fuckin' hear|some shit out here.
{59921}{60013}Fuck you.|I'm sweatin' my ass off draggin'|your fuckin' rope around.
{60015}{60068}- It must weigh 30 pounds.|- Shh!
{60069}{60139}We are doin' some serious|shit here. Now, get|a fuckin' hold of yourself!.
{60141}{60218}Oh, fuck you!|I'm not the rope-totin'|Charlie Bronson wannabe...
{60220}{60315}- that's gettin' us fuckin' lost.|- Would you fuckin' shut it!
{60347}{60393}You mother--
{60661}{60761}-Jesus fuckin' Christ.|- Oh, shit!
{61431}{61506}Shepherds we shall be|for Thee, my Lord, for Thee.
{61507}{61558}Power hath descended forth|from Thy hand.
{61560}{61619}Our feet may swiftly|carry out Thy command.
{61621}{61712}So we shall flow a river forth|to Thee, and teeming|with souls shall it ever be.
{62682}{62787}And I shall count thee|among my favored sheep.
{62788}{62886}And you shall have the protection|of all the angels in heaven.
{62951}{62997}Television.
{63045}{63098}Television is|the explanation for this.
{63100}{63191}You see this in bad television.
{63193}{63275}The little assault guys|creepin' through the vents,|comin' in through the ceiling.
{63277}{63370}Tha tJames Bond shit|never happens in real life.|Professionals don't do that.
{63416}{63543}Well, name one thing|you're gonna need|this stupid fuckin' rope for.
{63545}{63615}- That was way easier than I thought.|- Aye.
{63616}{63677}On TV,|you've always got that guy|that jumps over the sofa.
{63679}{63758}- And then you've gotta shoot him|for ten fuckin' minutes too.|- Aye.
{63791}{63862}- We're good.|- Yes, we are.
{63864}{63950}Now, what doyou think|is in that little case there?
{64104}{64178}- Fuck me!|- Oh.
{64180}{64230}The hits just keep on comin'.
{64232}{64287}Ow!|Give it a smell.
{64289}{64347}- I love our new job.
{64776}{64847}Bastard.|This has got to be|his big break.
{64848}{64978}-Yeah.|- We've got to fuck with him, right?
{64979}{65026}- Okay.
{65027}{65074}Shh.
{65075}{65152}Open the door.|I'm gonna grab him|by the fuckin' hair.
{65154}{65213}- Sit down!
{65215}{65283}- Get down! Shut up!|- Don't shoot! Don't shoot!
{65285}{65340}- We're on the same side.|Please, don't shoot.|- Get on the ground!
{65394}{65444}Don't shoot, don't shoot.|We're on the same side.
{65446}{65505}Boss must've sent me|in as backup. I'm Rocco!
{65507}{65575}- I'm the funny man.|That ain't my name.|- Where's your gun?
{65577}{65675}- Where's your gun?|- I'm the fuckin' funny man!|It's right here. Right here.
{65677}{65746}That ain't my real name.
{65747}{65833}What the fuck?|Jeez!
{65835}{65902}It's a fuckin' six-shooter!
{65903}{65985}- There's nine bodies, genius!
{65987}{66105}What the fuck were you gonna do,|laugh the last three to death,|funny man?
{66107}{66166}Pappa Joe said|there was only two!|In and out!
{66228}{66295}Boy, you guys|sure did a good job.
{66297}{66360}Ah, shit.|You guys are good, huh?
{66362}{66408}Cool masks.|Where'd you get 'em?
{66410}{66493}- We gotta do him right here!|- Right now!
{66495}{66554}- Don't, please! I'm the funny man!|- Right.
{66555}{66603}- Don't kill me!|Don't kill me, please!|- Right!
{66604}{66651}I'm the funny man!
{66846}{66892}What a fuckin' idiot!
{67005}{67108}Fuckin'--|What the fuckin' fuck--|Who the fuck--
{67110}{67238}Fuck this fuckin'--|How did you two|fuckin' fucks-- Fuck!
{67239}{67322}Well, that certainly illustrates|the diversity of the word.
{67423}{67502}All these guys|are Russian mob.
{67504}{67575}But not like those two peons|in the alley the other day.
{67577}{67647}These guys are all syndicate|bosses and underbosses.
{67649}{67702}I have a dossier|on every man in this room.
{67753}{67822}Since the Iron Curtain|has gone down,
{67824}{67890}the Russian syndicates|have started to come here.
{67891}{67993}And in the spirit of Glasnost,|the Soviets have opened|their borders to the Mafia.
{67995}{68066}But the Italians,|they aren't convinced...
{68068}{68148}the grounds in Mother Russia|are fertile enough|for organized crime yet.
{68150}{68278}So they ain't ready to commit.|But the Russians|are coming here anyway.
{68280}{68341}They are unwelcome.
{68343}{68434}So, what we have here,|gentlemen,
{68435}{68503}is possibly the beginning...
{68505}{68563}of the frst|international mob war.
{68597}{68670}Unless I've|totally missed something.
{68672}{68731}I'm live from|the Copley Plaza Hotel,
{68732}{68794}where we have just been informed|that the largest multiple murder...
{68795}{68851}in Boston's history|has just taken place.
{68853}{68904}We have learned that|there were nine victims,
{68906}{68987}all deeply involved in a notoriously|violent Russian crime syndicate,
{68989}{69035}right here in Boston.
{69037}{69100}Any body you think is evil?
{69102}{69155}Aye.
{69157}{69243}Don't you think|that's a little weird, a little psycho?
{69245}{69308}Do you know what I think|is psycho, Roc?
{69395}{69447}It's decent men|with loving families.
{69449}{69519}They go home|every day after work,|and they turn on the news.
{69520}{69583}You know what they see?|They see rapists...
{69585}{69636}and murderers|and child molesters.
{69638}{69684}They're all gettin'|out of prison.
{69686}{69757}Mafiosos...
{69759}{69812}gettin' caught|with 20 kilos...
{69814}{69887}gettin' out on bail|the same fuckin' day.
{69889}{69975}And everywhere,|everyone thinks the same thing--
{69977}{70050}that someone should just|go kill those motherfuckers.
{70077}{70166}Kill 'em all.|Admit it.
{70167}{70222}Even you've thought about it.
{70303}{70355}You guys should be|in every major city.
{70390}{70439}This is some heavy shit.
{70441}{70487}This is like|""Lone Ranger'' heavy, man.
{70534}{70629}Fuck it!|There's so much shit|that pisses me off!.
{70669}{70739}You guys should recruit, 'cause|I'm sick and fuckin' tired...
{70740}{70820}of walkin' down the street|wait in' for one of these crack-pipin',
{70822}{70903}ass-wipin', motherless|low lifes to get me!
{70905}{70958}Hallelujah, Jaffar.
{70960}{71007}So you're not just talkin'|about mob guys, right?
{71008}{71072}You're talkin' about pimps|and drug dealers|and all that shit, right?
{71074}{71116}Oh, yeah.
{71164}{71243}Fuck. You guys could|do this every goddamn day.
{71245}{71310}We're sort of like 7-Eleven.
{71312}{71396}We're not always doin' business,|but we're always open.
{71398}{71496}- Mmm. That is nicely put.|- Thank you very much.
{71721}{71772}I will fuck you up, dude.
{71939}{72015}So then we go right through|the fuckin' ceiling like this--
{72215}{72343}Oh, boy.|You fuckin' guys.|You ruined me.
{72345}{72409}I'm fuckin' done.
{72411}{72486}Permanent fuckin' package boy.
{72487}{72584}Who said that?|You can take credit|on that, you know?
{72586}{72642}What, are you serious?
{72643}{72690}Yeah. Fuck it.
{72730}{72795}If you think about it,|it's all you can do, really.
{72797}{72846}I mean,|you can't goin there|and tell him it was us.
{72848}{72896}Climb the corporate|ladder, boy.
{72898}{72969}Don Rocco.
{72971}{73026}Fuck it.
{73027}{73074}I'm doin' it.|I deserve it.
{73075}{73148}I've been workin'|for those fat bastards|since I've been in high school.
{73150}{73224}Look at this fuckin' place.|They're fuckin' me, man.
{73226}{73326}They can suck|my pathetic little dick!
{73328}{73389}And I'll dip my nuts|in marinara sauce...
{73391}{73455}just so the fat bastards|can get a taste of home|while they're at it.
{73457}{73538}Fuck it!|I'm doin'it.
{73540}{73606}It is done!|Shit!
{73607}{73686}- Shit! Shit!|- Oh, my God!
{73763}{73812}- What the fuck!|- I'm hit!
{73814}{73860}Oh, fuck!
{73862}{73916}What the fuck!
{73973}{74047}I can't believe|that just fuckin' happened!
{74049}{74102}- Is it dead?|- Oh, my God!
{74644}{74694}Donna's gonna be angry|about her cat.
{74695}{74757}Shit.
{74759}{74816}She's on every drug|known to man.
{74818}{74899}She'd have sold the thing|for a dime bag. Screw her.
{74975}{75032}I do kind of feel|like an asshole, though.
{75034}{75090}Yeah, Roc, you sound|real remorseful there.
{75092}{75142}She ain't been around|in weeks anyhow.
{75203}{75260}Listen, something's been|botherin' me about last night.
{75262}{75330}What?
{75331}{75400}What if your boss knew|how many fellows|were supposed to be there?
{75402}{75475}- What are you--|What areyou sayin'?|- Think about it.
{75477}{75532}Nine men, six bullets.
{75534}{75610}Think they sold me out?|No way. No way.
{75612}{75669}Listen, he probably knew|you'd end up nailin' the fat guy,
{75671}{75719}maybe one or two more,|but he had to know you|weren't walkin' out of there.
{75721}{75779}Figure it out.|The shooter's dead at the scene.
{75781}{75827}There's no|in-depth investigation.
{75829}{75886}They'll just slide right off|his fuckin' back.
{75888}{75935}'Cause what the fuck?
{75936}{76018}As much as I love you, man,|you are not exactly Don Corleone.
{76019}{76066}No, no, that--
{76067}{76120}That's just not the way|things are done.|Besides, how does he know...
{76122}{76193}I just don't get in there,|see there's too many of'em,|serve 'em their fuckin' food--
{76195}{76243}Because he fuckin'|knows you, Roc!
{76245}{76326}A smooth hitter would have|gone in there, seen it was|a fuckin' wash and slipped out.
{76328}{76380}But you, he knows|this is your only shot.
{76382}{76438}You've been waitin'|18 fuckin' years.
{76471}{76516}No. No, no.|That-That--
{76518}{76590}That just ain't the way--|No, that's bull-- That's bullshit.
{76592}{76666}You don't know what|you're talkin' about. That's|just not the way things happen.
{76667}{76742}I mean, thanks for your concern and all,|but that just ain't the thing of it.
{76744}{76802}Do me a favor, all right?|Just roll it around a bit|on your way in.
{76804}{76851}- Will you for me?|- No. No rollin'.
{76852}{76934}Nothin' needs to be rolled.|Fuck!
{76935}{77000}- Where the fuck are you goin'?|Did you tell him?|- Of course I fuckin' told him.
{77002}{77084}- Then what the fuck?|- You guys don't know|that shit for sure!
{77086}{77132}Oh, you're such|a fuckin' retard!
{77134}{77215}- Hey, fuck you!|- Oh, man, use your|fuckin' brain for once!
{77217}{77294}Is it so unbelievable that|they don't fuckin' care about ya?
{77296}{77354}Oh, yeah, you two fuckin' Micks|know what's goin' on, huh?
{77356}{77434}- Fuckyouboth!|- This is not a fuckin' thing you|should gamble on, all right?
{77484}{77535}I'm the fuck out ofhere.
{77537}{77583}Fine! Fuck it!
{77585}{77651}What kind of flowers you want|at your funeral, you dumb wop?
{77653}{77708}- It's the last time I'm gonna see ya!|- I'll be back at nine!
{77710}{77791}- Bury the fuckin' cat!|- Listen, you get in there...
{77793}{77853}and you start gettin' a bad vibe,|you get the fuck out quick!
{78050}{78099}- Hello?
{78101}{78173}- Murph.|- Hey, Roc. You okay?
{78175}{78243}Anybody call for me?
{78245}{78298}No, man.|Are you sure you're okay?
{78299}{78353}I'm fuckin' fne.
{78355}{78410}I'll catch you|on the flip side.
{78608}{78679}Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.
{79081}{79153}Pack your shit! Pack your shit!|We gotta get out of here!
{79155}{79228}- We gotta get out!|- What the fuck are you talkin' about?
{79230}{79288}I killed them!|Oh,Jesus, I killed them all!
{79290}{79344}- Just calm down.|Tell us what happened.|- No!
{79346}{79400}- Rocco!|- Calm down, man.
{79402}{79485}Fuck you!|You start gettin' excited,|motherfucker!
{79487}{79547}- We gotta go!|- Rocco!
{79595}{79658}- Well, how many were there?|- Fuckin' hurry the fuck up!
{79714}{79763}All right!|I love this shit!
{79765}{79858}- What the fuck is wrong withyou, Roc?|- The cocksucker sold me out!
{79860}{79912}Didn't I tell you, Roc?|Did they pull on you frst?
{79914}{79978}What am I doin'?|I'm in it at Lakeview!
{79979}{80026}Lakeview the deli, Roc?
{80027}{80107}- Looks like we got us|a new fuckin' recruit.|- Rocco!
{80109}{80206}- What?|- Where's my cat?
{80251}{80334}I killed your cat,|you druggie bitch.
{80336}{80371}- God. Why?|- What?
{80373}{80438}I felt it would bring|closure to our relationship.
{80439}{80511}- You killed my-my--|- Your what?
{80512}{80616}- My--|- Your fuckin' what? Huh?|Your what, bitch?
{80618}{80683}I'll shoot myself|in the head...
{80685}{80757}if you can tell me|that cat's name!
{80759}{80816}Go ahead! Your what?|Your precious little--
{80818}{80922}- Skippy. Skippy.|- Oh, Jesus.|What color was it, bitch?
{80924}{80978}Don't you fuckin'|yell at her like that,|you prick!
{80979}{81046}Shut your fat ass, Rayvie!
{81047}{81166}I can't buy a pack of smokes|without runnin' into|nine guys you fucked!
{81167}{81255}- Damn! Son of a bitch.
{81257}{81305}Let's go!
{81307}{81355}Let's get the fuck|outta here!
{81357}{81430}Those rat fucks! All of them|were all laughin' at me, man.
{81432}{81490}- Are you sure you killed them, Roc?|- Fuckin'-A right I did.
{81491}{81547}I had a goddamn|turkey shoot over there.
{81549}{81634}- Anybody call for me?|- No, man.|Are you sure you're okay?
{81636}{81682}I'm fuckin' fne.
{81727}{81794}I'll catch you|on the flip side.
{82284}{82390}I know there's something|happening here
{82391}{82507}I know there's something|happening here
{82509}{82623}Do my eyes deceive my mind
{82711}{82780}I'll bet it was|a fuckin' test.
{82782}{82906}Vincenzo came in here|shootin' his mouth off.|He made sure we knew.
{82988}{83053}But we did what|we were supposed to, huh?
{83055}{83115}We kept our mouths shut.
{83117}{83204}You?|You did your part.
{83254}{83300}Fuck!
{83302}{83367}They know we're good fellas now.
{83369}{83415}We'll get taken care of, baby.
{83417}{83468}What? Did everyone know?
{83470}{83553}Next thing you're gonna tell me|Sal was in on it.
{83555}{83626}Vincenzo told Sal frst.|That fat fuck knew|before we did.
{83668}{83734}At least we got|our funny man back, huh?
{83791}{83892}Here's some more|that you fear
{84011}{84104}- That was funny, wasn't it?|That was real fucking funny!|- No, not me! Not me!
{84106}{84176}Huh? Ha! Funny! Funny!
{84178}{84249}- Funny! Funny! Funny!
{84251}{84301}- Funny!|- Full, full
{84303}{84351}Full, full
{84353}{84399}Full, full
{84401}{84490}- Full|- Listen, Roc, did anybody seeya?
{84491}{84578}Fuck, man, I might as well|have gone around postin' flyers.
{84579}{84669}Right out in public, man.
{84671}{84718}Liberating, isn't it?
{84719}{84790}- Let's fucking go!|- You know, it is a bit.
{84855}{84937}Conner, stop the car!|Stop the fucking car, man!
{84976}{85052}Vincenzo,|that fat motherfucker,|Yakavetta's right hand!
{85054}{85153}He's the one who set me up,|then he went around telling|everybody I was as good as dead.
{85155}{85251}Goes there every Wednesday night|10:00, jerks off on the same|titty dancer. Never misses.
{85253}{85336}- Yeah, so?|- So? So let's kill|the motherfucker!
{85338}{85403}I mean, what are you guys?|That's your new thing, right?
{85405}{85467}- Yeah, well--|- Ah, what the fuck!
{85469}{85522}I mean, who makes the cut?|Is there a raffle or something?
{85524}{85619}To tell you the truth,|those first ones, they just sort|of fell on to our laps.
{85620}{85667}Well, what do you do?
{85668}{85724}We haven't really got a system|of decidin' who, Roc. It's--
{85785}{85852}Me! Me! I'm the guy!
{85854}{85942}I know everyone, their habits,|who they hang out with,|who they talk to!
{85944}{86014}I got phone numbers, addresses!|I know who they're fuckin'!
{86016}{86067}I know where they live!
{86069}{86115}We could kill everyone.
{86159}{86205}So what do you think?
{86272}{86319}I'm strangely comfortable|with it.
{86640}{86703}That's him.
{87160}{87236}- Okay, Roc.
{87295}{87344}What? You guys got masks.
{87346}{87410}You look like Mush Mouth|from Fat Albert.
{87412}{87488}Fine. Fuck it!|When we're done,|she can I.D. me.
{87490}{87570}I don't care. Just trying|to be professional, but no!
{87572}{87633}- It looks fne.|- No, fuck it.
{87635}{87736}No, shut the fuck up!|You look good. Put it on.|You look fucking scary, man.
{87832}{87932}Now, Roc, are you sure|that you're ""O-B-kay-B''?
{88187}{88238}
{88278}{88354}She was in here|when it all went down.
{88356}{88426}- Can she I.D. 'em?|- No.
{88427}{88485}- There were wearin' masks.|- Of course they were.
{88487}{88542}You scream, you're dead!|Which one's he in?
{88543}{88654}And don't make like|you don't know who the fuck|I'm talkin' about!
{88656}{88747}- Don't you talk to me like that,|you dirty little girl.
{88749}{88795}Oh, yeah. Give it to Daddy.
{88797}{88882}Oh, this is one|sick motherfucker.
{88884}{88941}- How many?|- Three.
{88943}{88989}Two of them did the shootin'.
{88991}{89070}|"...and teeming with souls|shall it ever be. ''
{89141}{89226}Our little theory from last night|just got shot to shit.
{89252}{89298}Something new is going on here.
{89519}{89574}After talking to the dancer,
{89576}{89671}we know their mark|was the guy in the middle booth.
{89673}{89763}After she watches 'em whack him,|she passes out.
{90291}{90340}What the fuck are you doing?
{90342}{90388}I'll tip her!
{90390}{90448}Why are there two|extra victims?
{90450}{90526}- Witnesses.|- No way they could have seen.
{90617}{90712}Allow me|to enlighten you gentlemen...
{90714}{90760}to the protocol|of the porno industry,
{90762}{90873}as I'm sure you've never been|in one of these places before.
{90875}{90962}A man goes into the booth,|puts the money through the slot,
{90964}{91011}the dancer gets it|on the other side.
{91013}{91059}She hits the button,|the door goes up.
{91061}{91165}Now there's only|glass between you, and|that's ""little freman'' time.
{91167}{91220}No way they could have seen it.
{91222}{91306}Those doors were down,|so that means this:
{91308}{91365}They looked in,|down through the peep holes,
{91366}{91461}saw these guys, opened the doors|from the inside,
{91463}{91521}pop, pop, pop,|right through the glass.
{91523}{91569}Why?
{91773}{91873}- It's like a scumbag yard sale.|- We should come down here|once a week and clean house.
{91874}{91961}Maybe the three guys|had something in common.
{91962}{92046}No, this guy's big-time.|These two are street-walkin' scum.
{92048}{92114}Then that's what they had in|common-- they're all bad guys.
{92116}{92197}Now they're all dead bad guys.
{92198}{92251}Oh, man, you gotta|let me do these guys.
{92253}{92309}I'm such a moron.|I gotta make up|for that tit thing.
{92311}{92396}- There's no way. I've been|waitin' for this asshole.|- Oh, come on.
{92398}{92473}Come on, man.|Give the guy his shot.
{92474}{92576}It's the real deal, Roc.|Evil men, dead men.
{92643}{92689}Good shooting...
{92691}{92737}shitty shooting.
{93050}{93119}Plus... we got us a genuine...
{93120}{93200}Kennedy assassination-style|bullet theory here.
{93202}{93248}Two guns were used.|The guy in the middle...
{93250}{93324}was done with both of'em.
{93326}{93391}Now this guy, he was killed...
{93392}{93448}with bullets|from gun ""A'' only...
{93450}{93496}and this guy, gun ""B'' only.
{93498}{93618}But ballistics dug two slugs|out ofthe wall from ""B''...
{93620}{93675}over here where the victim|was done with ""A.''
{93676}{93736}Andit's the same thing over here.
{93847}{93915}Why the crossover?
{93916}{93994}That's just fuckin' weird.|I have no idea.
{93996}{94043}Jesus, I just can't think|any more.
{94045}{94140}That scene over at the coffee|shop today just tapped me out.
{94141}{94188}What scene?
{94189}{94243}Some guy went nuts|over of the Com Ave.
{94244}{94343}Shot three guys to death in|a coffee shop, broad daylight,|fled the scene.
{94344}{94404}- Don't have much on him.|- Why wasn't I informed of this?
{94406}{94458}They weren't related.|The guy used a .38.
{94460}{94523}- No pennies, totally amateur.|- Who were the victims?
{94524}{94623}- A couple of mob peons|and a fat fuck bartender.|- Oh, isn't that beautiful?
{94625}{94753}All the low lifes in quiet city|Boston start droppin' dead,|and you think it's unrelated!
{94755}{94838}Greenly, the day I want|the Boston Police to do|my thinkin' for me,
{94840}{94898}I will have a fucking tag|on my toe!
{94900}{94951}Now get me a squad car|and get me over there!
{94952}{95023}I want crime scene photos|and any witness statements now!
{95504}{95551}Wyatt fuckin' Earp!
{95606}{95719}It looks like we got us|a cowboy. Hmm.
{95721}{95767}"So we shall flow a river forth|to Thee...
{95769}{95856}and teeming with souls|shall it ever be. ''
{95990}{96052}Hey, hey, man.|You guys gotta teach me|that prayer.
{96054}{96130}- That's some good shit, man.|- Cool it, Roc. It's a family prayer.
{96132}{96222}- My father's father before him.|So that's our shit.|- Oh, come on!
{96224}{96270}The victims were found...
{96272}{96318}at a local|adult entertainment parlor.
{96320}{96393}These murders,|coupled with the three suspected|mob-related killings...
{96395}{96477}that occurred|at this local Boston deli|earlier this afternoon,
{96479}{96539}brings the death toll to six,|just today.
{96541}{96611}There is no doubt that all|the victims have been criminals.
{96612}{96668}Perhaps this explains|why a public outcry...
{96670}{96739}to have these crimes stopped|has not been heard.
{96741}{96824}Ah, these two crime scenes|are related.
{96826}{96892}Too many coincidences.
{96894}{96948}Same day, fivehours apart,
{96950}{97012}dead mobsters in both scenes.
{97000}{97046}Now...
{97048}{97113}why did he kill the bartender?
{97115}{97256}Crime of passion.|Just went nuts.|He shot everyone in here.
{97258}{97343}- Just ran out of bullets.|- Does this look like a friggin'|post office to you?
{97345}{97391}This guy came in here|with intent.
{97393}{97470}Maybe he didn't know|exactly what he was gonna do,|but he had a good idea.
{97472}{97522}No, the bar tender|was no fuckin' accident.
{97524}{97577}Well, we didn't need|any help on that.
{97579}{97649}A lot of people saw it.|Nobody's talkin'.
{97682}{97732}Figures.
{97734}{97790}Oh, look.
{97792}{97845}Areyou guys seeing|the pattern here?
{97914}{98015}We got big questions|at both of these crime scenes|with no answers.
{98017}{98117}Why did they kill the guys|in the other two booths?
{98118}{98182}Why did they do the bartender?
{98254}{98317}Fuck!
{98319}{98394}I hate cold crime scenes!
{98396}{98444}I'm fucking leaving now.
{98507}{98582}And do me a favor.|Tell me when the next one does,
{98584}{98642}'cause these guys|are not done yet.
{99277}{99323}Fuck you.
{99350}{99416}Augustus, I need your help.
{99418}{99518}I have a serious problem.|I am not screwing around here.
{99590}{99649}I need... Il Duce.
{100086}{100165}The Duke? Huh.
{100166}{100234}What did you do?
{100236}{100305}Rocco-- this package boy--
{100306}{100357}he could bring down|the whole East Coast.
{100358}{100422}If he decides|to turn state's evidence,
{100424}{100498}he could take us apart|brick by brick.
{100500}{100571}But he's happy, now,
{100573}{100641}with just killing us|one by one.
{100642}{100743}And worse, he's good at it.
{100745}{100850}Listen, kid.|I hope you understand|who you're dealin' with here.
{100852}{100921}This guy is no slouch.
{100922}{100969}When I was a boy,
{100970}{101066}my papa used to speak of him|like he was a ghost.
{101068}{101134}- Move him.
{101182}{101281}Your father and I used him|three times in 20 years,
{101283}{101365}only when things got|totally fucked.
{101367}{101437}Whenever we needed|one of our own bumped off,
{101438}{101488}we'd call this guy in.
{101490}{101553}He had a thing|for clippin' wise guys.
{101555}{101610}But only one rule
{101612}{101669}No women, no kids.
{101671}{101736}Believe me, kid,|you don't want this guy...
{101738}{101850}unless you are 100% sure|you need him.
{101852}{101923}He's a fuckin' monster.|But only one thing.
{101925}{101996}He's been rottin' in the can|the last 25 or 30 years.
{101998}{102065}Don't even know if he's still|alive or if he's even up to it.
{102474}{102521}There.
{102566}{102657}- Well, there are ways around that.|- Yeah. Go find one.
{102764}{102824}All right.|Let's talk some business here.
{102826}{102924}I know a sick fuck|makes the ones we been doin'|look like altar boys.
{102976}{103034}Worst night of my life|when I met this guy.
{103036}{103096}The guy never says|a fuckin' word to me.
{103098}{103149}We're drivin' 25 minutes,
{103150}{103244}never a sigh,|no throat clearing, nothing.
{103284}{103365}Yeah, you're always making great|fuckin' sense, you dumb bitch.
{103416}{103482}- I don't care.
{103484}{103570}His face--blank, man.|Just nothin' there.
{103572}{103644}This guy takes out|a whole family--
{103646}{103757}wife, kids, everyone--like|he's ordering a fucking pizza.
{103791}{103861}This house is clean.
{103910}{103977}I knew if I didn't keep it|together, it was my ass.
{104104}{104157}He has a poker game|outback of his place...
{104159}{104209}with a bunch of wise guys|every Saturday.
{104471}{104540}Worst day of my life, man.
{104542}{104617}Well, I'm sold.
{104699}{104745}Don't worry, Roc.
{104747}{104805}We'll do this guy right,|and you'll feel a lot better.
{105290}{105354}Okay.
{105355}{105402}Here's what happened.
{105538}{105621}They waited in a parked car down|the street for the kid to leave.
{105707}{105757}There he goes.
{105875}{105927}They came in through the garage.
{105929}{106000}The kid says he leaves it open|when he takes his bike out.
{106055}{106151}Now they know|the wife is the gatekeeper.|She knows the code.
{106153}{106211}- Hit the numbers, lady.|Hit the numbers.
{106213}{106296}- I will kill you! I will kill you!|- Don't! Her hands are tied.
{106298}{106355}Why do I always gotta be|on bitch detail?
{106357}{106437}The wife says|she doesn't know what happened|after she hit the code.
{106439}{106532}She just remembers going down,|but judging from the burn mark|on her back,
{106534}{106620}I think what they did|was use a stun gun on her.
{106622}{106702}Now this guy knows|that his friend is coming|to the game,
{106704}{106795}and they know that this door can|only be opened from the inside.
{106797}{106884}So they wait.|And when that door opens,
{106886}{106932}man...
{106959}{107006}nobody's ready for it.
{107160}{107238}Panic, devastation.
{107239}{107306}This was like shootin' fish|in a friggin' barrel.
{107347}{107399}All of'em.
{108001}{108051}Now these guys dove|under the table.
{108052}{108149}The trajectory|on the bullet showed that|they came from straight across.
{108151}{108221}So that means one of our|shooters dropped to his knees.
{108798}{108896}-Something went wrong right here.|-Shit! Shit! He ain't here!
{108898}{108963}Oh, what the fuck you mean,|he isn't here?
{108964}{109032}- I mean he ain't here!|- Look again, for fuck's sake!
{109034}{109083}I know what the fuck|he looks like!
{109123}{109188}Look behind ya!
{109190}{109236}Ah! Son of a--
{109286}{109350}Oh, shit!
{109352}{109412}- Shoot this motherfucker!
{109414}{109481}No!|Fucking let the bloke go!
{109483}{109553}- Let him go!|- Fuck! Jesus!
{109555}{109627}- Now's your chance|to earn your stripes, Roc!|- He'll fucking get killed!
{109629}{109676}It was your idea|to bring him in!
{109678}{109744}One of these guys|is a real sicko.
{109746}{109809}He knew this man.|He wanted him to suffer.
{109811}{109888}Allright, Roc.|Now's your chance!
{109889}{109948}- You take that man!|- I don't wanna die!
{110478}{110548}Sick fuck! Sick fuck!
{110549}{110612}Sick fuck!
{110614}{110708}- All right then.|- Fuckyou, fuckin'--
{110710}{110789}Now take a fuckin' deep breath|there, Roc. You did fine.
{110791}{110837}It was nicely done.
{110918}{110996}They exited out the front door.
{110998}{111073}They had no idea|what they were in for.
{111379}{111468}Now they're starin'|at six men with guns drawn.
{111469}{111523}It was a fuckin' ambush.
{111597}{111643}This was a fuckin' bomb...
{111645}{111697}droppin' on Beaver Cleaverville.
{111741}{111861}Fora few seconds,|this place was Armageddon.
{111910}{111970}There was a firefight!
{113139}{113212}- You son of a bitch!
{113912}{113972}Murph, areyou all right?
{113974}{114033}Motherfucker!
{114035}{114135}- Roc, get the fucking bag!|- Fuckin' shit! Christ!
{114137}{114208}- Get the blood! Get the blood!|- What the fuck was that?
{114209}{114316}- He shot my fucking finger off!.|- Roc, what the fuck?|Get the fuck out of here!
{114317}{114387}- Motherfucker!|- Fucking shit!
{114388}{114463}- Get the fucking bag!|- My fucking finger!
{114465}{114516}Fucking shit!
{114632}{114715}What if it was just one guy|with six guns?
{114717}{114785}Why don't you let me do|the thinking, huh, genius?
{114835}{114905}Hey, what's taking so long|with those blood samples?
{114907}{114956}I can't get a good sample.
{114958}{115006}Oh!
{115008}{115063}There's a variable here|I'm not seeing.
{115361}{115449}They used ammonia.
{115451}{115516}None of this is any good.|Fuck!
{115517}{115591}You know what that means?|Even if we get suspects in the case,
{115593}{115640}we got nothin',|nothin', nothin'!
{115641}{115705}Fuck!|Who the fuck are they?
{115707}{115796}I've never seen|any fucking thing like this|in my fucking life!
{115797}{115856}Who the fuck are they?
{116750}{116839}Who the fuck washe, Rocco?|I know you fucking know,|so don't even start.
{116840}{116893}Fuck you! I told you|I never saw him before!
{116895}{116951}Well, he sure as fuck knew you!
{116953}{117016}Fuck you! Fuck you both!
{117017}{117064}- Yeah? Don't start lying to us now!
{117065}{117124}We're fuckin'|three amateurs here!
{118202}{118277}I'm confdent that|their investigation will end...
{118279}{118332}in the apprehension|of the suspects.
{118379}{118460}- Fuckin' hell.|- What? What, that guy?
{118462}{118540}That's the guy|that got us off the hook|with the Checkov thing.
{118542}{118591}- And he's one smart man.|- They got nothin'.
{118592}{118691}Well, this guy is very sharp.|If he hasn't figured us out yet,|he will.
{118692}{118796}- You bet your ass he will.|- Well, I'd say that makes him|a lia-fuckin'-bility.
{118797}{118857}- He isn't to be touched.|- He's a good man.
{118887}{118936}Okay, whatever.
{119803}{119900}No, that's all wrong.|David Della--
{119991}{120038}I missed it.
{120416}{120485}Paul, you've already had quite a bit.|Are you sure you wanna--
{120486}{120574}-Just pour the drink,|you fairy fuck.
{120575}{120658}Whew! I smell you.
{121044}{121093}Hey, Murph.
{121095}{121158}This early mornin'|church shit's gotta go.
{121160}{121245}We have to go in the mornin'.|We're on the lam now, you know.
{122656}{122702}Hey.
{122805}{122866}You're gonna do what I say,|got it?
{122973}{123033}- Yes.|- I'm sorry you're gonna|have to see this.
{123035}{123082}- Don't look at me.|- I didn't see any--
{123083}{123135}Shut up.|Shut the fuck up.
{123137}{123226}Don't do this, my son.
{123227}{123274}Have you no fear of God?
{123275}{123355}That's who I'm doin' this for.|Now open the fuckin' thing,|Father.
{123357}{123419}Father,|I'll do you right here.
{123421}{123481}God have mercy on my soul.
{123557}{123638}You little fuck, let him go or|I'll drop you right fuckin' now.
{123639}{123711}Okay,just calm down.|He could hurt us, brother.
{123713}{123770}- He could ruin the whole thing.|- You let him go...
{123772}{123826}or I will deliver you|right fucking here!
{123828}{123897}You won't do it.|You won't, Conner.|You love me, man.
{123898}{123971}- I swear to fuckin'--|- Hello. You there?
{123973}{124021}Y-Yes, my son.
{124023}{124082}Do your thing, Father.|Don't fuck this up.
{124146}{124226}- How long since your last confession?|- Christ.
{124228}{124303}I've never confessed.
{124305}{124365}I come here for advice,
{124367}{124430}not ""salvation.''
{124432}{124529}Why have you come|to a church for counsel|if you're not religious?
{124530}{124605}It's ethics.
{124606}{124686}I put evil men behind bars,
{124687}{124782}but the law has miles|of red tape and loop holes...
{124783}{124854}for these cocksuckers|to slip through.
{124856}{124941}I found... out|there are these two guys...
{124943}{125003}who fix the situation|with an iron fist...
{125005}{125053}as if they had God's permission.
{125055}{125114}God's permission?|God doesn't grant--
{125115}{125162}In this day and age,
{125163}{125225}I believe what they do|is necessary.
{125227}{125276}I feel it is correct.
{125278}{125333}A soul|is what gives us feelings.
{125334}{125403}It's like a conduit...
{125405}{125473}through which|the Lord speaks to us.
{125474}{125542}You felt your answers|would be here...
{125543}{125609}in the house|of the Lord today.
{125610}{125707}And you feel...|these men are necessary.
{125755}{125815}So the Lord has spoken to you|twice today.
{125817}{125863}Has He now?
{125865}{125978}You are the one who came|into this church speaking|about beliefs and feelings.
{125979}{126065}Is it so hard to believe|that God has brought you here?
{126066}{126113}I guess not.
{126114}{126186}It's very easy|to be sarcastic about religion.
{126187}{126259}But it's much more difficult...
{126261}{126310}to take a stand.
{126344}{126432}I wanna stand|for what I believe in, Father.
{126434}{126498}First you have to know|what your beliefs are.
{126529}{126634}I believe that these young men|are right.
{126636}{126721}- You know them personally?|- Yes.
{126722}{126806}Would they ever harm an innocent|person, for any reason?
{126808}{126883}No. They would never do that.
{126885}{126950}Well, the two|Irish guys wouldn't.
{126951}{127010}The Italian guy, he might.|He's kind of an idiot.
{127035}{127098}I'm beginning to see.
{127100}{127174}All the things|I wish I could do,
{127176}{127237}these guys are doing.
{127238}{127326}W-W-What should I do?
{127328}{127413}Because I am a man...
{127414}{127483}who's supposed|to uphold the law.
{127485}{127577}The laws of God...|are higher...
{127578}{127678}than the laws... of man.
{127680}{127783}Yes, I-I was thinking that too.|No, no. I was feeling it.
{127785}{127852}All I needed|was to hear you say it.
{127903}{127989}Amen. I will help them.
{127991}{128057}- Forgive me, Father.|- Thank you, Father.
{128127}{128184}Whatever.
{128186}{128238}Amen. Good-bye.
{128447}{128554}Now listen.|Um, "dominus ominus, ''you know.
{128555}{128650}And remember, you're bound.|You can't talk to anyone|about this. No one.
{128651}{128714}- Just get out of the church.|- Okay.
{128716}{128783}Just get out of the church!
{128860}{128935}The Lord works|in mysterious ways.
{128937}{128990}What the fuck's|that supposed to mean?
{129049}{129121}- That's all you can give me?|- The light hit the side|of his face.
{129123}{129206}Looked like he had a gray beard.|Maybe late '50s, early '60s.
{129207}{129270}So you're telling me|it was one guy with six guns,
{129272}{129342}and he was|a senior freakin' citizen?
{129343}{129416}Yeah, and it's better|if we fnd this man|before he finds us again.
{129418}{129483}I'll see what I can do.|How do I get in touch with you?
{129485}{129581}We'll hit Pappa Joe tonight,|right in the comfort|of his own home.
{129582}{129647}We're gonna move on to New York.|It's just--
{129649}{129721}- It's getting a bit hot for us here.|- Be careful.
{129722}{129774}All right.|Call you tonight, afterwards.
{129776}{129841}- It feels like it's still there.|- Yeah, but it's not.
{129908}{129986}I don't know who he is.|Nobody does.
{129987}{130079}The Duke'sa fuckin' Houdini.|He does a disappearin' act.
{130081}{130127}What did he bring him in for?
{130129}{130238}Well, he needs an outsider.|This Rocco kid is smart.
{130240}{130325}He knows everyone.|He'd spot our hitters|a mile away.
{130327}{130386}Just for him-- the package boy?
{130387}{130490}He's the one shootin' up|all his guys, right?|He's scared of the kid.
{130492}{130586}- Said he's good. He's got|every gun in the city up there.|- Up where?
{130588}{130655}Up at his house.|I don't know what's going on,
{130657}{130705}but I know it's gotta have|something to do with this kid.
{130707}{130742}Oh, fuck!
{130941}{131020}We got 'em.|They tried to get in|through the basement.
{131022}{131066}- How many?|- Three.
{131280}{131350}Where you goin; huh?|Where the fuck you goin; huh?
{131352}{131405}I'm fuckin' talkin' to you,|motherfucker!
{131498}{131594}- Fuck you!|- Shut up!
{131596}{131642}Shh! Shh.|Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh.
{131644}{131755}- Shh.
{131822}{131890}Sit up.
{131892}{131966}You have some answers|for me, no?
{131968}{132050}Yeah. Fuck you.
{132100}{132173}Roc! Roc, look at me!
{132175}{132245}- Roc!
{132246}{132311}Shit!
{132313}{132393}- Roc!
{132444}{132526}- Roc! Roc, you'll be fine!
{132592}{132662}- Roc!
{132718}{132801}Okay.|What do you boys think?
{132802}{132860}- These guys are tough.|- Fuckin'-A, right.
{132862}{132918}- Ain't no fuckin' way|they're gonna talk.|- I know Rocco.
{132920}{132992}He ain't smart enough|for this shit. Those other|guys are the brains.
{132994}{133066}- He's just a player.|- He's a punk.
{133091}{133138}There's only one thing to do.
{133316}{133405}God! No!
{133471}{133599}- Roc! Roc! No!
{133648}{133697}Roc! Roc!
{133699}{133782}- No!
{133783}{133845}No! Roc!
{133846}{133893}Roc!
{133894}{133998}You can't stop!|You get out of here.|Don't ever stop.
{134000}{134065}Roc! No!
{134162}{134259}No! Roc!
{134261}{134326}- You motherfucker!
{134328}{134423}Yeah!|I'm gonna kill them!
{134497}{134550}- Hey, boss.|- Yeah, Chappy?
{134552}{134622}I don't mean no disrespect,|but I think we're forgettin'|something here.
{134623}{134711}This Il Duce's a fuckin' animal.|He's gonna stop|when someone dies.
{134713}{134787}I guarantee you right now,|he thinks this thing is on.
{135006}{135082}- What?
{135146}{135210}If this guy still thinks|the job is on,
{135212}{135306}motherfucker is in the bushes|right now.
{135307}{135413}I am going.|You four... stay here...
{135414}{135461}and deal with it.
{135882}{135931}Do it!
{135933}{136011}-Just one fuckin' guy.|- Fuck you, Geno.
{136013}{136081}- What's the big fuckin' deal?|- Do it!
{136270}{136346}I'm going back downstairs|and workin' on these pricks.
{136412}{136497}- What the fuck?
{136867}{136925}Hey.
{136926}{136994}Joey Bevo sent me over...
{136995}{137054}as entertainment.
{137056}{137102}Sorry, baby. Tonight|ain't the night for this shit.
{137104}{137177}It's really hittin'|the fan in there,|you know what I'm sayin'?
