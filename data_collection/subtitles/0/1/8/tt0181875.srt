1
00:02:24,458 --> 00:02:27,211
All right, you chipmunks.
Ready to sing your song?

2
00:02:27,294 --> 00:02:29,713
- Ill say we are!
- Let's sing it now.

3
00:02:29,838 --> 00:02:31,254
Okay, Simon?
- Okay!

4
00:02:31,338 --> 00:02:33,758
Okay, Theodore?
- Okay!

5
00:02:33,841 --> 00:02:35,677
Okay, Alvin?

6
00:02:35,878 --> 00:02:36,678
Alvin?

7
00:02:38,061 --> 00:02:38,861
Alvin!

8
00:02:38,862 --> 00:02:39,862
Okay!

9
00:02:40,598 --> 00:02:45,351
Christmas, Christmas
time is near

10
00:02:45,434 --> 00:02:49,855
Time for toys
and time for cheer

11
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:55,236
We've been good
but we can't last

12
00:02:55,361 --> 00:02:59,572
Hurry, Christmas
Hurry fast

13
00:02:59,698 --> 00:03:03,993
Want a plane
that loops the loop

14
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:09,165
Me, I want a hula hoop

15
00:03:09,291 --> 00:03:13,252
We can hardly
stand the wait

16
00:03:13,377 --> 00:03:17,171
Please, Christmas
Dont be late

17
00:03:26,263 --> 00:03:29,474
You wanna be Atticus Finch. Good.

18
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:31,393
- I like him.
- Why?

19
00:03:31,476 --> 00:03:33,895
- He's honest.
- Yes.

20
00:03:34,021 --> 00:03:36,605
- He stands up for the right thing.
- Yes.

21
00:03:36,730 --> 00:03:38,732
- And he's a good father.
- He is.

22
00:03:38,857 --> 00:03:41,109
- Did it all by himself.
- Did what all by himself?

23
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:43,863
- Raised his kids.
- He didn't raise them by himself!.

24
00:03:43,988 --> 00:03:47,033
Who was the woman that
came to their house every day?

25
00:03:47,158 --> 00:03:49,908
- Calpurnia.
- Calpurnia. He remembered.

26
00:03:49,992 --> 00:03:52,119
- And what about Boo?
- What about Boo?

27
00:03:52,202 --> 00:03:53,704
Boo Radley is the most interesting
character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

28
00:03:53,704 --> 00:03:55,998
Boo Radley is the most interesting
character in To Kill a Mockingbird.

29
00:03:56,123 --> 00:03:58,125
Mom, tell me more about Livia.

30
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:02,337
She killed everybody so her son Tiberius
could inherit the throne-- like Nixon.

31
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:04,088
It's awfully common.

32
00:04:04,213 --> 00:04:08,718
The same stories, the Shakespeare, like
those plays we saw at the Old Globe.

33
00:04:08,843 --> 00:04:11,929
- Anita?
- Hey, Mom.

34
00:04:12,054 --> 00:04:15,765
- Want something to eat?
- No, thanks. I already ate.

35
00:04:15,891 --> 00:04:20,145
- Are you sure? I made soy cutlets.
- I'm fine. I already ate.

36
00:04:20,187 --> 00:04:22,688
Wait.
You've been kissing.

37
00:04:22,813 --> 00:04:25,566
- No, I haven't.
- Yes, you have.

38
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,361
- I can tell.
- You can't tell.

39
00:04:28,443 --> 00:04:32,237
Not only can I tell,
I know who it is. It's Darryl.

40
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,662
What you got
under your coat?

41
00:04:41,914 --> 00:04:44,040
It's un fair that we can't
listen to our music.

42
00:04:44,123 --> 00:04:46,918
It's because it is about drugs
and promiscuous sex.

43
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,962
Simon and Garfunkel is poetry.

44
00:04:49,087 --> 00:04:51,757
It is the poetry
of drugs and promiscuous sex.

45
00:04:51,882 --> 00:04:54,549
Honey, they're on pot.

46
00:04:57,803 --> 00:05:01,431
First, it was butter.
Then it was sugar and white flour.

47
00:05:01,556 --> 00:05:05,768
Bacon, eggs, bologna,
rock 'n' roll, motorcycles.

48
00:05:05,851 --> 00:05:09,814
Then, it was celebrating Christmas
on a day in September...

49
00:05:09,897 --> 00:05:12,441
when you knew it
wouldn't be commercialized.

50
00:05:12,566 --> 00:05:16,611
- What else are you gonna ban?
- You want to rebel against knowledge.

51
00:05:16,736 --> 00:05:19,322
I'm trying to give you the Cliff's Notes
on how to live life in this world.

52
00:05:19,447 --> 00:05:21,907
We're like nobody else I know!

53
00:05:21,991 --> 00:05:26,579
I am a college professor.
Why can't I teach my own kids? Use me.

54
00:05:26,705 --> 00:05:29,790
Darryl says that you
use knowledge to keep me down.

55
00:05:29,915 --> 00:05:31,792
He says I'm a ''yes'' person...

56
00:05:31,917 --> 00:05:34,377
and you are trying to raise us
in a '' no'' environment.

57
00:05:35,628 --> 00:05:38,339
Well, clearly '' no'' is a word
Darryl doesn't hear much.

58
00:05:38,423 --> 00:05:40,716
I can't live here! I hate you!

59
00:05:40,841 --> 00:05:43,219
- Even William hates you.
- I don't hate her.

60
00:05:43,303 --> 00:05:45,471
You do hate her.
You don't even know the truth.

61
00:05:45,597 --> 00:05:47,889
- Don't be a drama queen.
- Feck you!

62
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:52,018
This is a house of lies!

63
00:05:52,893 --> 00:05:54,895
There it is.

64
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:58,942
- Your sister used the ''f'' word.
- I think she said ''feck.''

65
00:05:59,067 --> 00:06:02,694
- What's the difference?
- The letter '' u.''

66
00:06:39,644 --> 00:06:42,563
I look so much younger
than everyone else.

67
00:06:42,647 --> 00:06:45,732
Enjoy it while you can.

68
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:47,859
Mom, it's time.

69
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:52,489
- Can this wait till we get home?
- Mom, pull over.

70
00:06:52,572 --> 00:06:54,866
Tell him the truth.
Tell him how old he is.

71
00:07:02,957 --> 00:07:04,333
He knows how old he is.

72
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:07,378
But other kids make fun of him
because of how young he looks.

73
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:11,422
Nobody includes him. They call him
''The Narc'' behind his back.

74
00:07:11,547 --> 00:07:13,549
- They do?
- What's a narc?

75
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:18,178
- A narcotics officer.
- Well, what's wrong with that?

76
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,597
Come on, you guys.
It's no big deal.

77
00:07:21,681 --> 00:07:24,601
I'm twelve.
She skipped me a grade.

78
00:07:24,685 --> 00:07:26,645
Big deal.
I'm a year younger.

79
00:07:26,687 --> 00:07:28,814
They're 1 3, I'm 1 2.

80
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:33,066
Aren't I ?

81
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:36,361
I also put you in first grade when
you were five, and I never told you.

82
00:07:37,737 --> 00:07:39,322
So I'm how old?

83
00:07:39,364 --> 00:07:41,323
You're 11 .

84
00:07:43,702 --> 00:07:47,538
- Eleven?
- So you skipped fifth grade.

85
00:07:47,621 --> 00:07:50,791
-There's too much padding in the grades.
-Eleven?

86
00:07:55,253 --> 00:07:58,923
This explains... so much.

87
00:07:59,048 --> 00:08:01,467
You've robbed him
of an adolescence.

88
00:08:02,594 --> 00:08:04,094
Adolescence is a marketing tool.

89
00:08:05,721 --> 00:08:08,682
Honey, I know you were
expecting puberty...

90
00:08:08,765 --> 00:08:11,726
but youre just gonna have to
shine it on for a little while.

91
00:08:11,851 --> 00:08:14,728
Who needs a crowd?

92
00:08:14,811 --> 00:08:18,649
Who put such a high premium
on being typical?

93
00:08:18,774 --> 00:08:23,112
You're unique. Take those extra years
and do what you want.

94
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:26,196
Go to Europe for a year.
Take a look around.

95
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:28,908
See what you like.

96
00:08:29,033 --> 00:08:30,910
Follow your dream.

97
00:08:31,035 --> 00:08:33,538
You'll still be
the youngest lawyer in the country.

98
00:08:33,663 --> 00:08:37,248
Your dad was so proud of you.
He knew you were an accelerated child.

99
00:08:39,751 --> 00:08:41,669
What about me?

100
00:08:43,254 --> 00:08:45,840
You are rebellious
and ungrateful of my love.

101
00:08:49,759 --> 00:08:53,597
This song explains why I'm leaving home
to become a stewardess.

102
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:56,934
We can't talk?
We have to listen to rock music?

103
00:08:57,017 --> 00:08:58,517
I love you.

104
00:09:14,908 --> 00:09:16,909
Let us be lovers

105
00:09:16,992 --> 00:09:20,079
We'll marry our fortunes together

106
00:09:22,956 --> 00:09:27,795
I've got some real-estate
here in my bag

107
00:09:31,506 --> 00:09:35,259
Hey, man, take good care
of her in San Francisco, man.

108
00:09:37,761 --> 00:09:39,721
And walked off

109
00:09:39,846 --> 00:09:43,558
To look for America

110
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,813
One day... you'll be cool.

111
00:09:52,525 --> 00:09:56,151
Look under your bed.
It'll set you free.

112
00:09:57,820 --> 00:10:01,324
Michigan seems
like a dream to me now

113
00:10:01,449 --> 00:10:03,368
Watch the plant.

114
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:08,746
You're 1 8 and I can't stop you.

115
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:13,668
I've gone to look for America

116
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:15,211
Bye.

117
00:10:19,382 --> 00:10:21,133
She'll be back.

118
00:10:24,011 --> 00:10:26,013
Maybe not soon.

119
00:10:30,892 --> 00:10:33,353
I said, be careful
His bow tie

120
00:10:33,437 --> 00:10:36,314
Is really a camera

121
00:10:42,861 --> 00:10:44,738
Toss me a cigarette

122
00:10:44,863 --> 00:10:48,407
I think there 's one in my raincoat

123
00:10:50,951 --> 00:10:54,747
We smoked the last one an hour ago

124
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,209
So I looked at the scenery

125
00:11:01,335 --> 00:11:05,631
She read her magazine

126
00:11:05,756 --> 00:11:11,429
And the moon rose
over an open field

127
00:12:34,544 --> 00:12:36,963
Here 's a theory
for you to disregard...

128
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:39,173
completely.

129
00:12:40,299 --> 00:12:43,760
Music, you know--
true music--

130
00:12:43,844 --> 00:12:46,762
not just rock 'n' roll--
it chooses you.

131
00:12:46,846 --> 00:12:49,765
It lives in your car, or alone,
listening to your headphones--

132
00:12:49,849 --> 00:12:54,437
you know, with the vast, scenic bridges
and angelic choirs in your brain.

133
00:12:54,562 --> 00:12:55,938
It's a place apart...

134
00:12:56,022 --> 00:12:58,315
from the vast, benign...

135
00:12:58,440 --> 00:12:59,816
lap of America.

136
00:12:59,941 --> 00:13:02,651
It's quite an honor to have
the world's greatest rock critic...

137
00:13:02,776 --> 00:13:04,653
and editor of Creem magazine...

138
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:07,866
back home in San Diego
for a few days.

139
00:13:07,991 --> 00:13:11,368
- Lester Bangs.
- The Doors? Jim Morrison?

140
00:13:11,452 --> 00:13:13,661
He's a drunken buffoon
posing as a poet.

141
00:13:13,745 --> 00:13:16,122
- I like the Doors.
- Give me the Guess Who.

142
00:13:16,206 --> 00:13:21,586
They got the courage to be drunken
buffoons. Which makes them poetic!

143
00:13:21,711 --> 00:13:24,880
Give me some
''White Light/White Heat.''

144
00:13:25,005 --> 00:13:26,673
Iggy Pop!

145
00:13:26,798 --> 00:13:29,134
Amen!

146
00:13:29,218 --> 00:13:31,762
Put this on.
This isn't on your play list either.

147
00:13:31,845 --> 00:13:35,182
- Isn't it a bit early for that?
- Not for me.

148
00:13:35,265 --> 00:13:40,060
That was Lester Bangs, this is
Alice Wisdom, and here is Iggy Pop.

149
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:51,529
So youre the kid who's sent me those
articles from the school newspaper.

150
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:53,614
Yeah. Yeah.

151
00:13:53,739 --> 00:13:57,034
I've been doing some stuff for
a local underground paper also.

152
00:13:57,159 --> 00:14:01,247
- What are you, the star of your school?
- They hate me.

153
00:14:01,372 --> 00:14:04,832
You'll meet them all again
on their long journey to the middle.

154
00:14:04,958 --> 00:14:09,003
Your writing is damn good. It's just
a shame you missed out on rock 'n' roll.

155
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:10,546
- It's over.
- Over?

156
00:14:10,671 --> 00:14:14,633
It's over. You got here
just in time for the death rattle.

157
00:14:14,716 --> 00:14:17,844
Last gasp.
Last grope.

158
00:14:17,970 --> 00:14:20,763
- At least I'm here for that.
- What do you type on?

159
00:14:20,888 --> 00:14:23,307
Smith-Corona Galaxies Deluxe.

160
00:14:24,725 --> 00:14:27,311
- And you like Lou Reed?
- The early stuff.

161
00:14:27,436 --> 00:14:29,479
I n his new stuff,
he's trying to be Bowie.

162
00:14:29,563 --> 00:14:31,147
He should just be himself.

163
00:14:32,565 --> 00:14:34,651
- You take drugs?
- No.

164
00:14:34,776 --> 00:14:35,944
Smart kid.

165
00:14:37,571 --> 00:14:39,698
I used to do speed.

166
00:14:41,283 --> 00:14:43,992
You know, and sometimes
a little cough syrup?

167
00:14:44,075 --> 00:14:47,203
I'd stay up all night,
just writing and writing.

168
00:14:47,328 --> 00:14:50,165
I mean,
like 25 pages of dribble--

169
00:14:50,291 --> 00:14:53,501
You know, about The Faces,
or Coltrane.

170
00:14:53,626 --> 00:14:56,503
You know, just to fucking write.

171
00:14:58,005 --> 00:15:01,008
All right.
It's been nice to meet ya.

172
00:15:01,133 --> 00:15:04,011
Keep sending me your stuff.

173
00:15:04,136 --> 00:15:07,556
I can't stand here all day
talking to my many fans.

174
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:09,181
I understand.

175
00:15:09,307 --> 00:15:13,728
You know, because once you go to L.A.,
you're gonna have friends like crazy.

176
00:15:13,811 --> 00:15:17,397
But they're gonna be fake friends.
They're gonna try to corrupt you.

177
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:20,567
You got an honest face,
and they're gonna tell you everything.

178
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:23,986
But you cannot make friends
with the rock stars.

179
00:15:26,114 --> 00:15:28,324
- Is it okay if I--
- If youre gonna be a true journalist--

180
00:15:28,449 --> 00:15:30,701
you know, a rock journalist--

181
00:15:32,536 --> 00:15:34,829
First, you never get paid much.

182
00:15:34,913 --> 00:15:38,040
But you will get free records
from the record company.

183
00:15:42,170 --> 00:15:43,504
Jesus.

184
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:46,549
Fucking nothing about you
that is controversial, man.

185
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:51,427
God, it's gonna get ugly, man.
They're gonna buy you drinks.

186
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:55,848
You're gonna meet girls, they're gonna
fly you places for free, offer drugs.

187
00:15:55,973 --> 00:15:58,852
I know it sounds great,
but these people are not your friends.

188
00:15:58,936 --> 00:16:01,269
These are people who want you
to write sanctimonious stories...

189
00:16:01,394 --> 00:16:03,271
about the genius of rock stars.

190
00:16:03,396 --> 00:16:06,358
And they will ruin rock 'n' roll,
and strangle...

191
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:09,319
everything we love
about it, right?

192
00:16:09,402 --> 00:16:12,530
And then it just becomes
an industry of cool.

193
00:16:12,655 --> 00:16:17,368
I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock 'n' roll.

194
00:16:17,451 --> 00:16:21,872
That's why I think you should turn,
go back, and be a lawyer or something.

195
00:16:27,751 --> 00:16:29,628
But I can tell from your face
that you won't.

196
00:16:30,754 --> 00:16:32,506
I can give you 35 bucks.

197
00:16:32,631 --> 00:16:36,218
- Give me 1 ,000 words on Black Sabbath.
- An assignment?

198
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:53,024
You have to make your reputation
on being honest...

199
00:16:53,149 --> 00:16:54,609
and...

200
00:16:56,527 --> 00:16:58,612
you know, unmerciful.

201
00:16:59,738 --> 00:17:02,032
Honest.

202
00:17:02,157 --> 00:17:03,868
Unmerciful.

203
00:17:03,993 --> 00:17:06,536
If you get into a jam,
you can call me.

204
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:08,538
I stay up late.

205
00:17:10,748 --> 00:17:10,874
Look at this.

206
00:17:10,874 --> 00:17:13,459
Look at this.

207
00:17:13,543 --> 00:17:17,754
An entire generation of Cinderellas,
and there's no slipper coming.

208
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,964
You want to get high?
Looking to get high?

209
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:22,633
All I have to do is listen.

210
00:17:22,758 --> 00:17:26,805
- That's what Lester Bangs said.
- As long as I know this is a hobby.

211
00:17:26,930 --> 00:17:30,224
I'll pick you up right here
at  11:00 sharp.

212
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,018
If you get lost,
use the family whistle.

213
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:36,897
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

214
00:17:46,071 --> 00:17:47,531
Don't take drugs!

215
00:17:52,952 --> 00:17:54,829
Yes, Mother!

216
00:18:12,637 --> 00:18:14,804
Hi. I'm William Miller.

217
00:18:14,888 --> 00:18:17,934
I'm here from Creem magazine
to interview Black Sabbath.

218
00:18:21,395 --> 00:18:23,314
Not on the list.

219
00:18:33,281 --> 00:18:37,116
- Sir, I'm a journalist. Here's a copy--
- You're not on the list.

220
00:18:37,242 --> 00:18:40,203
Go to the top of the ramp
with the other girls.

221
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:45,959
We won't bite.

222
00:18:46,084 --> 00:18:48,043
What happens after
I go to the top of the ramp?

223
00:18:55,926 --> 00:18:57,802
Who are you with?

224
00:18:57,927 --> 00:19:00,680
Me? I'm with myself.

225
00:19:00,763 --> 00:19:03,181
No. Who are you with?
What band?

226
00:19:03,306 --> 00:19:08,312
Oh. I'm here to interview Black Sabbath.
I'm a journalist.

227
00:19:08,396 --> 00:19:10,981
I'm not-- Not a--
You know.

228
00:19:11,106 --> 00:19:12,983
You're not a what?

229
00:19:18,195 --> 00:19:20,238
You're not a what?

230
00:19:20,363 --> 00:19:23,366
I'm not a... groupie.

231
00:19:24,952 --> 00:19:28,080
We are not groupies.

232
00:19:28,164 --> 00:19:30,665
This is Penny Lane, man.
Show some respect.

233
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:35,544
Groupies sleep with rock stars 'cause
they wanna be near someone famous.

234
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:38,881
We're here because of the music.
We are Band Aids.

235
00:19:39,006 --> 00:19:42,383
-She used to run a school for Band Aids.
-We don't have intercourse with them.

236
00:19:42,508 --> 00:19:46,179
We inspire the music.
We're here because of the music.

237
00:19:46,304 --> 00:19:48,055
She was the one
who changed everything.

238
00:19:48,181 --> 00:19:51,642
She was the one who said,
'' No more sex.

239
00:19:51,726 --> 00:19:53,935
No more exploiting
our bodies and our hearts.''

240
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:56,478
- Right.
-just blowjobs, that's it.

241
00:19:57,479 --> 00:20:00,192
- It's all happening!
- It's all happening!

242
00:20:05,946 --> 00:20:08,948
Here comes Sabbath!
Ozzy Osbourne!

243
00:20:10,450 --> 00:20:12,702
It's me, Polexia!

244
00:20:19,292 --> 00:20:20,710
I think I saw Sapphire in there.

245
00:20:23,045 --> 00:20:25,797
Does anybody remember laughter?

246
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:27,173
Sapphire!

247
00:20:29,050 --> 00:20:31,677
- Come on!
- Passes, girls!

248
00:20:31,761 --> 00:20:33,722
Come and get 'em!

249
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:37,933
- No, not this one.
- Who brought Opie?

250
00:20:38,058 --> 00:20:39,768
- He's with us.
- Top of the ramp!

251
00:20:39,893 --> 00:20:42,437
- Don't go anywhere, Opie.
- I'll take care of this.

252
00:20:42,521 --> 00:20:43,980
If I can.

253
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:03,247
Come on, boys.
Pick it up, will ya?

254
00:21:03,372 --> 00:21:05,833
This is outrageous.
We're an hour and a half late!

255
00:21:05,916 --> 00:21:07,836
I'm coming, I'm coming.

256
00:21:15,883 --> 00:21:19,762
Freddy! Open up!
It's Stillwater! We're on the show!

257
00:21:27,144 --> 00:21:29,980
I'm a journalist.
I write for Creem magazine.

258
00:21:30,063 --> 00:21:33,440
Oh, the Enemy.
A rock writer.

259
00:21:33,566 --> 00:21:36,652
Right. I'd like to interview you
or somebody from your band.

260
00:21:36,777 --> 00:21:40,613
Look. I'm sorry,
but could you please fuck off?

261
00:21:40,697 --> 00:21:43,159
We play for the fans,
not the critics.

262
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:50,707
Russell, Jeff...

263
00:21:50,790 --> 00:21:52,708
Ed, Larry.

264
00:21:52,791 --> 00:21:54,543
I really love your band.

265
00:21:54,626 --> 00:21:57,378
I think the song '' Fever Dog''
is a big step forward for you.

266
00:21:58,337 --> 00:22:01,633
And you guys producing it yourselves
instead of Glyn Johns...

267
00:22:01,758 --> 00:22:03,802
that was the right thing to do.

268
00:22:03,927 --> 00:22:06,970
And Russell, Russell,
the guitar sound...

269
00:22:07,888 --> 00:22:09,556
is incendiary.

270
00:22:11,224 --> 00:22:13,268
In-Incendiary.

271
00:22:15,645 --> 00:22:17,190
Way to go.

272
00:22:23,527 --> 00:22:25,696
Hey, man.
Don't stop there.

273
00:22:25,779 --> 00:22:27,948
- I'm incendiary too, man.
- I didn't mean ''fuck off. ''

274
00:22:31,867 --> 00:22:34,662
- How are you doing?
- He's with us. This way, bro.

275
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:37,749
- He's not on your list!
- Here's a list of people who do belong.

276
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:43,462
Take a straight and stronger course
to the corner of your life

277
00:22:43,545 --> 00:22:45,213
Hey, Red Dog!

278
00:22:45,296 --> 00:22:47,715
Hey-hey!
Good to see you, man.

279
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,177
Some people have a hard time
explaining rock 'n 'roll.

280
00:22:50,302 --> 00:22:53,888
I don't think anyone can
really explain rock 'n' roll.

281
00:22:54,013 --> 00:22:57,599
Maybe Pete Townshend,
but that's okay.

282
00:22:57,724 --> 00:23:01,727
Rock 'n' roll is a lifestyle
and a way of thinking...

283
00:23:01,852 --> 00:23:04,313
and it's not about money
and popularity.

284
00:23:04,438 --> 00:23:07,275
Although some money would be nice.

285
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,445
But it's a voice that says,
'' Here I am...

286
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:14,614
and fuck you
if you can't understand me.''

287
00:23:14,697 --> 00:23:17,742
And one of these people
is gonna save the world.

288
00:23:17,826 --> 00:23:20,787
And that means that rock 'n' roll
can save the world...

289
00:23:20,870 --> 00:23:22,789
all of us together.

290
00:23:22,914 --> 00:23:27,543
And the chicks are great. But what
it all comes down to is that thing.

291
00:23:27,668 --> 00:23:31,964
The indefinable thing when people
catch something from your music.

292
00:23:32,089 --> 00:23:35,633
What I'm talking about is--
Wait, what am I talking about?

293
00:23:35,758 --> 00:23:37,634
- The buzz.
- The buzz.

294
00:23:37,759 --> 00:23:40,262
And the chicks, the whatever...

295
00:23:40,387 --> 00:23:42,807
is an offs hoot of the buzz.

296
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:44,809
Like you saying
you liked '' Fever Dog.''

297
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,977
That is the fucking buzz!

298
00:24:02,324 --> 00:24:04,117
Found you a pass.

299
00:24:06,369 --> 00:24:08,537
Thanks. I got in with Stillwater.

300
00:24:08,579 --> 00:24:11,206
Oh. Stillwater.

301
00:24:30,556 --> 00:24:33,101
Now you're mysterious.

302
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:39,441
How old are you?

303
00:24:39,566 --> 00:24:41,941
- Eighteen.
- Me too.

304
00:24:43,067 --> 00:24:44,486
How old are we really?

305
00:24:45,778 --> 00:24:48,364
- Seventeen.
- Me too.

306
00:24:48,490 --> 00:24:50,785
Actually, I'm 1 6.

307
00:24:52,536 --> 00:24:55,746
Me too. Isn't it funny?

308
00:24:55,871 --> 00:24:59,124
- The truth just sounds different.
- I'm 1 5.

309
00:25:03,378 --> 00:25:05,338
What's your real name?

310
00:25:07,466 --> 00:25:09,342
I'll never tell.

311
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,096
The Enemy!

312
00:25:15,597 --> 00:25:17,307
Russell! Hey.

313
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:20,227
This is Penny Lane.

314
00:25:21,644 --> 00:25:23,687
Penny Lane, Russell Hammond.

315
00:25:27,024 --> 00:25:28,609
Pleasure.

316
00:25:28,734 --> 00:25:32,029
- '' Penny Lane,'' like the song.
- Have we met?

317
00:25:54,215 --> 00:25:56,592
Can we bring the lights down?

318
00:26:05,851 --> 00:26:08,353
Hey, get the Enemy in here.

319
00:26:08,478 --> 00:26:11,647
Get on my back
for piggyback ride

320
00:26:17,069 --> 00:26:19,905
- San Diego!
- You ready, baby?

321
00:26:25,243 --> 00:26:27,286
Hell, yeah!

322
00:26:27,369 --> 00:26:30,956
Good evening, San Diego!

323
00:26:31,039 --> 00:26:33,167
Stand right over there.

324
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,419
Would you please welcome...

325
00:26:35,544 --> 00:26:37,838
from Troy, Michigan--

326
00:26:39,839 --> 00:26:41,674
Stillwater!

327
00:27:11,534 --> 00:27:15,038
Fever dog

328
00:27:15,079 --> 00:27:18,915
Scratching at my back door

329
00:27:18,998 --> 00:27:22,835
I hear you howl

330
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:26,423
But I don't listen no more

331
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:31,302
Got a feeling I could taste
every hair of the fever

332
00:27:31,384 --> 00:27:34,012
Dog

333
00:27:34,137 --> 00:27:37,349
Come around again
We'll have to feed it then

334
00:27:37,432 --> 00:27:41,853
Another fever dog

335
00:28:04,957 --> 00:28:07,084
You wanna come to L.A.?

336
00:28:07,167 --> 00:28:09,211
We'll be at
the Riot House all week.

337
00:28:09,336 --> 00:28:11,504
- Riot House?
- Yeah.

338
00:28:11,629 --> 00:28:15,883
The Continental Hyatt House.
It's on Sunset Strip.

339
00:28:16,008 --> 00:28:19,137
Oh, yeah, right.
Sunset Strip.

340
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:22,974
Well, tell your friend...

341
00:28:23,099 --> 00:28:27,268
Miss Penny Lane, to call me.

342
00:28:27,351 --> 00:28:29,687
Tell her it ain't
California without her.

343
00:28:29,812 --> 00:28:32,148
We want her around,
like last summer.

344
00:28:32,231 --> 00:28:34,109
Say it just like that.

345
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:38,153
- Got it.
- I'm under '' Harry Houdini.''

346
00:28:40,572 --> 00:28:42,157
I get it.

347
00:28:42,282 --> 00:28:45,160
- Come on, let's blow this burg!
- Hey, Enemy!

348
00:28:45,243 --> 00:28:48,203
Come up to L.A.,
we'll talk some more.

349
00:28:48,287 --> 00:28:51,707
- Bye, Opie.
- See you later, Jeff, Polexia, Dick.

350
00:28:51,790 --> 00:28:56,420
Scully, Ed. See ya, Mick, Greg.
Later, guys.

351
00:28:58,755 --> 00:29:00,339
Bye, Opie.

352
00:29:05,719 --> 00:29:08,305
Hey, Red Dog.
I'll see ya later, man.

353
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:10,807
''The Wheel.''
'' Frosty.''

354
00:29:12,017 --> 00:29:14,811
Ainsworth,
I'll see you around, man.

355
00:29:14,936 --> 00:29:17,062
- Penny!
- Hey, be cool.

356
00:29:17,188 --> 00:29:19,272
Penny, you just missed Russell.

357
00:29:19,397 --> 00:29:21,941
He said he's at the Riot House all week,
and for you to call him.

358
00:29:22,025 --> 00:29:25,571
He's under the name
Harry Houdini.

359
00:29:28,532 --> 00:29:32,785
- You know about the Riot House, right?
- I think I've heard of it.

360
00:29:32,868 --> 00:29:37,539
He had a message. He said, ''Tell her
it's not California without you.

361
00:29:37,623 --> 00:29:39,917
We want you around,
like last summer.''

362
00:29:40,042 --> 00:29:43,252
No! He said, ''Tell her it ain't
California without you, we want--''

363
00:29:43,377 --> 00:29:46,881
- I get the gist.
- Right.

364
00:29:46,964 --> 00:29:50,051
So, how well do you guys
know each other?

365
00:29:57,014 --> 00:30:01,144
Call me if you need a rescue.
We live in the same city.

366
00:30:02,521 --> 00:30:04,939
I think I live
in a different world.

367
00:30:07,191 --> 00:30:09,359
Speaking of the world...

368
00:30:10,902 --> 00:30:13,071
I've made a decision.

369
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:17,242
I'm gonna live in Morocco
for one year.

370
00:30:20,994 --> 00:30:23,580
I need a new crowd.

371
00:30:26,916 --> 00:30:29,460
Do you wanna come?

372
00:30:30,878 --> 00:30:32,255
Yes.

373
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:37,175
- You sure?
- Ask me again.

374
00:30:37,259 --> 00:30:39,678
Do you wanna come?

375
00:30:43,723 --> 00:30:46,268
- You've gotta call me.
- Okay.

376
00:30:48,893 --> 00:30:50,896
It's all happening.

377
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:52,940
It's all happening.
It's all happening.

378
00:30:55,818 --> 00:30:59,863
- You all right?
- Yeah, yeah. Great.

379
00:31:18,254 --> 00:31:21,715
And it's not about money
and popularity--

380
00:31:29,514 --> 00:31:31,641
And the chicks are great. Right?

381
00:31:33,184 --> 00:31:35,936
Keep the small bills on the outside,
and call me if anyone gets drunk.

382
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:38,439
I will call you if anyone,
anywhere, gets drunk.

383
00:31:38,564 --> 00:31:40,815
- Good.
- And don't take drugs.

384
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:43,526
Ha-ha. Very funny.

385
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:45,820
See? Sense of humor.

386
00:31:45,945 --> 00:31:49,574
Funny joke. Have fun at the dance.
I'm glad you're making friends.

387
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:52,243
- Mom, stay.
- Okay.

388
00:31:53,494 --> 00:31:56,079
Love you. Bye.

389
00:32:06,004 --> 00:32:08,131
I always tell the girls,
never take it seriously.

390
00:32:08,256 --> 00:32:11,051
If you never take it seriously,
you never get hurt.

391
00:32:11,176 --> 00:32:13,720
If you never get hurt,
you always have fun.

392
00:32:13,804 --> 00:32:16,224
And if you ever get lonely...

393
00:32:16,349 --> 00:32:18,724
you just go to the record store...

394
00:32:18,849 --> 00:32:20,726
and visit your friends.

395
00:32:21,852 --> 00:32:24,063
- So you and Russell--
- No!

396
00:32:24,146 --> 00:32:29,234
Russell has a girlfriend,
and I can't even say her name.

397
00:32:41,453 --> 00:32:45,415
It's all happening.
I'm about to use you as protection.

398
00:32:45,540 --> 00:32:47,417
- Penny!
- Hi!

399
00:32:49,001 --> 00:32:51,045
I saw them on the 7th floor.

400
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:55,049
Mr. Jimmy Page, Mr. john Paul Jones,
Mr. Robert Plant.

401
00:32:55,133 --> 00:32:58,176
Mr. Robert Plant, he signed--

402
00:32:58,301 --> 00:33:00,845
signed my T-shirt five minutes ago.

403
00:33:00,928 --> 00:33:04,181
Please don't smear it.
Oh, dear God. Please don't smear it.

404
00:33:04,306 --> 00:33:06,475
But five minutes ago,
he touched this pen.

405
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:09,104
- Vic is a Zeppelin fan.
- I picked that up.

406
00:33:09,187 --> 00:33:12,021
He tours with them,
but not, you know, with them.

407
00:33:12,147 --> 00:33:14,774
Yeah, they're on the top floor now.

408
00:33:14,899 --> 00:33:17,277
There's no bigger
Zeppelin fan than Vic.

409
00:33:17,402 --> 00:33:20,530
Please stay

410
00:33:20,613 --> 00:33:23,198
I wanna hear you play

411
00:33:23,323 --> 00:33:26,493
Very dear, very close
friend of Lester Bangs.

412
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,954
William Miller.

413
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:35,209
Ladies and gentlemen!

414
00:33:35,293 --> 00:33:38,837
At this time, please extinguish
all smoking materials...

415
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:42,967
for the captain has turned on
the '' No Smoking'' sign.

416
00:33:43,092 --> 00:33:45,677
Your seats and tray tables
should be locked...

417
00:33:45,761 --> 00:33:48,555
and in their full,
upright position.

418
00:33:59,148 --> 00:34:00,983
The hell with it.

419
00:34:01,067 --> 00:34:03,860
- Play on.
- Miss Penny Lane.

420
00:34:03,943 --> 00:34:06,654
Oh, thank you, thank you.

421
00:34:11,825 --> 00:34:16,330
Act One, in which she pretends
she doesn't care...

422
00:34:16,455 --> 00:34:18,748
about him.

423
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:25,379
Act Two, in which he pretends
he doesn't care about her...

424
00:34:25,463 --> 00:34:28,840
but he goes right for her.

425
00:34:33,637 --> 00:34:36,306
Act Three, in which
it all plays out...

426
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:38,475
the way she planned it.

427
00:34:38,600 --> 00:34:41,477
She'll eat him alive.

428
00:34:41,602 --> 00:34:44,813
- We've got to stop them.
- Stop them?

429
00:34:46,606 --> 00:34:50,403
You were her excuse
for coming here.

430
00:34:54,781 --> 00:34:56,365
I need ice.

431
00:35:02,788 --> 00:35:04,205
Hi, man.

432
00:35:21,846 --> 00:35:24,098
- William Miller?
- This is he.

433
00:35:24,181 --> 00:35:27,727
This is Ben Fong-Torres. I'm the
music editor at Rolling Stone magazine.

434
00:35:27,810 --> 00:35:32,064
We got a couple copies of your stories
from the San Diego Door.

435
00:35:32,189 --> 00:35:35,024
- Is this the same William Miller?
- Yes, it is.

436
00:35:35,150 --> 00:35:39,153
''Voice of God, howling dogs,
the spirit of rock 'n' roll.''

437
00:35:39,236 --> 00:35:41,405
- This is good stuff, man.
- Thanks.

438
00:35:41,530 --> 00:35:44,033
Uh, thanks. Thanks.

439
00:35:44,159 --> 00:35:46,661
I think you should be
writing for us. Any ideas?

440
00:35:50,163 --> 00:35:52,957
- How about Stillwater?
- Stillwater?

441
00:35:53,082 --> 00:35:57,754
'' Hard-working band makes good.''
New album out, their third.

442
00:35:57,879 --> 00:36:00,048
Starting to do something. Crazy.

443
00:36:00,172 --> 00:36:03,717
Let's do 3, 000 words.
We'll join the band on the road.

444
00:36:03,842 --> 00:36:05,802
Don't let the band
pay for anything.

445
00:36:05,886 --> 00:36:07,929
We can only pay, let me see...

446
00:36:08,013 --> 00:36:09,972
3,000 words--

447
00:36:11,098 --> 00:36:12,933
Seven hundred dollars.

448
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,937
All right, a grand.

449
00:36:17,063 --> 00:36:20,982
What's your background?
Are you a journalism major?

450
00:36:22,525 --> 00:36:24,861
- Yeah.
- What college?

451
00:36:24,986 --> 00:36:28,238
Honey,  I need you to do that thing
that fixes the garbage disposal.

452
00:36:34,828 --> 00:36:38,248
Well, I certainly know how my lady gets
when you don't snap to it.

453
00:36:38,374 --> 00:36:40,375
- Crazy.
- Crazy.

454
00:36:42,001 --> 00:36:43,210
Stillwater?

455
00:36:43,335 --> 00:36:46,630
Beware, beware of
Rolling Stone magazine...

456
00:36:46,755 --> 00:36:49,508
because they will
change your story...

457
00:36:49,633 --> 00:36:52,844
they'll rewrite it, you know,
turn it into swill--

458
00:36:52,928 --> 00:36:55,596
But besides that,
what would be wrong with it?

459
00:36:57,098 --> 00:37:00,518
You got starry eyes, my friend.

460
00:37:00,643 --> 00:37:03,187
Look. Do the story.

461
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:07,649
Who cares, you know?
It'll be good for ya.

462
00:37:07,732 --> 00:37:12,112
Remember this: Don't do it
to make friends with people...

463
00:37:12,195 --> 00:37:15,490
who are trying to use you...

464
00:37:15,573 --> 00:37:18,367
to further the big business desire...

465
00:37:18,449 --> 00:37:21,953
to glorify worthless rock stars
like Stillwater!

466
00:37:22,036 --> 00:37:24,122
Dont let those
swill merchants rewrite you.

467
00:37:25,999 --> 00:37:28,876
- ''Swill merchants.'' That's good.
- Yeah, swill merchants.

468
00:37:31,087 --> 00:37:33,422
- What are you listening to?
- Stillwater.

469
00:37:33,505 --> 00:37:37,008
Stillwater?
Fucking kid's doing drugs.

470
00:37:40,386 --> 00:37:42,305
No more than four days...

471
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,515
and I want you to give me
a phone number where you are.

472
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:49,145
I want you to call me twice a day,
and you do not miss more than one test!

473
00:37:53,231 --> 00:37:55,525
And no drugs.

474
00:37:55,608 --> 00:37:58,193
Oh, this is a big mistake.

475
00:38:20,089 --> 00:38:22,924
Come on, Doris, you darling bus.
You can make it.

476
00:38:34,727 --> 00:38:37,937
- This is what I was talking about.
- Russell, excuse me.

477
00:38:38,063 --> 00:38:40,273
I was wondering
if maybe we could...

478
00:38:40,357 --> 00:38:42,692
find some time to talk
when we get to Phoenix.

479
00:38:42,817 --> 00:38:46,445
I want to interview everyone separately,
and I thought we'd start with...

480
00:38:46,528 --> 00:38:48,655
-just you and me.
- Absolutely.

481
00:38:49,906 --> 00:38:52,701
- I've got a thing in a couple days.
- We'll figure out something later.

482
00:38:52,785 --> 00:38:54,620
just enjoy the ride.

483
00:38:54,745 --> 00:38:57,038
- Keep playing that song.
- All right.

484
00:39:11,968 --> 00:39:14,137
Come by in a few minutes.
We'll do that interview.

485
00:39:14,262 --> 00:39:16,138
- All right?
- Sure.

486
00:39:19,432 --> 00:39:22,477
- Is this Mr. Miller?
- Yeah.

487
00:39:22,602 --> 00:39:24,980
You have a message from Elaine.

488
00:39:25,106 --> 00:39:26,524
Your mother.

489
00:39:26,607 --> 00:39:28,818
She's a handful.

490
00:39:30,609 --> 00:39:33,195
- I know.
- She freaked me out.

491
00:39:41,494 --> 00:39:43,413
I'm worried, man.

492
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,042
No, you can trust him.
He's a fan.

493
00:39:48,167 --> 00:39:50,086
But it's Rolling Stone.

494
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:54,715
He looks harmless, but he does represent
the magazine that trashed '' Layla''...

495
00:39:54,798 --> 00:39:58,300
broke up Cream, ripped every album
Led Zeppelin ever made.

496
00:39:58,426 --> 00:40:01,263
Don't forget the rules, man.
This little shit is the Enemy.

497
00:40:01,388 --> 00:40:02,763
He writes what he sees.

498
00:40:02,847 --> 00:40:05,433
If I don't get into a room,
I'll take a Valium--

499
00:40:06,809 --> 00:40:09,728
Although it would be cool
to be on the cover.

500
00:40:14,606 --> 00:40:17,444
You are going to get me
in so much trouble!

501
00:40:17,527 --> 00:40:20,488
Simon Kirke from Bad Company
is by the pool.

502
00:40:31,330 --> 00:40:32,915
Housekeeping.

503
00:40:36,710 --> 00:40:38,128
Go away!

504
00:40:39,212 --> 00:40:41,381
Should I come by later?

505
00:40:41,465 --> 00:40:45,218
Yes. I'm in too truthful a mood.

506
00:40:45,302 --> 00:40:47,719
- Maybe that's a good thing.
- Go away!

507
00:40:50,306 --> 00:40:53,309
- You okay?
- Yeah.

508
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,897
Don't worry. Come to
the radio interview tonight. Okay?

509
00:40:58,980 --> 00:41:00,814
Go away!

510
00:41:00,939 --> 00:41:02,900
- Bye.
- You're so rude.

511
00:41:14,202 --> 00:41:17,497
- May I speak with William?
- He 's still in the bar with the band.

512
00:41:17,622 --> 00:41:21,458
They just got back from the radio
station. Is this Maryann, with the pot?

513
00:41:23,794 --> 00:41:25,296
Hello?

514
00:41:27,881 --> 00:41:30,842
No. This is not
Maryann with the pot.

515
00:41:30,926 --> 00:41:33,177
This is Elaine.
His mother.

516
00:41:35,763 --> 00:41:38,015
Could you give William
a message for me, please?

517
00:41:38,140 --> 00:41:41,852
Tell him to call home immediately,
and also tell him...

518
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:46,022
I know what's going on.

519
00:41:46,106 --> 00:41:50,151
Okay. But I'm just gonna say this,
and I'm gonna stand by it:

520
00:41:50,276 --> 00:41:52,695
You should be
really proud of him.

521
00:41:52,820 --> 00:41:55,446
'Cause I know men,
and I'll bet you do too.

522
00:41:55,571 --> 00:41:58,616
He respects women,
and he likes women.

523
00:41:58,701 --> 00:42:01,912
And let's just pause
and appreciate a man like that.

524
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:05,497
You created him out of thin air,
you know, you raised him right.

525
00:42:05,580 --> 00:42:08,041
He's having a great time.
He's doing a good job.

526
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:12,921
And, don't worry, he's still a virgin,
and we 're all looking out for him.

527
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,633
You know? That's more than I've
ever even said to my own parents.

528
00:42:17,926 --> 00:42:19,301
So there you go.

529
00:42:21,470 --> 00:42:23,973
This is the maid speaking,
by the way.

530
00:42:25,057 --> 00:42:28,810
- Can you please hold it down?
- Sorry, ma'am!

531
00:42:34,065 --> 00:42:37,527
Russell! So, what is it
you love about music?

532
00:42:38,652 --> 00:42:42,114
Shut that thing off for a second
and I'll tell you the truth, all right?

533
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:48,786
Look-- Fuck. I trust you,
so I'm just gonna lay this right on ya.

534
00:42:51,873 --> 00:42:53,791
just make us look cool.

535
00:42:56,586 --> 00:43:00,629
I will quote you
warmly and accurately.

536
00:43:00,755 --> 00:43:03,799
Well, that's what
I'm worried about.

537
00:43:05,217 --> 00:43:07,136
Some of us...

538
00:43:07,262 --> 00:43:09,639
we got girlfriends
back home, you know?

539
00:43:10,723 --> 00:43:13,141
Some of us have wives.

540
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:17,437
And some of the people
that you meet on the road...

541
00:43:17,562 --> 00:43:20,065
are really amazing people.

542
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:28,030
Like you.

543
00:43:30,908 --> 00:43:33,451
But some of the stuff that happens,
it's good for...

544
00:43:33,534 --> 00:43:36,787
a few people to know about,
as opposed to, say...

545
00:43:38,955 --> 00:43:41,416
a million people.

546
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:45,003
- Understand what I'm trying to say?
- Yeah.

547
00:43:45,128 --> 00:43:49,091
See, I grew up with these guys,
but I can't play all that I can play.

548
00:43:49,216 --> 00:43:52,843
I'm past 'em,
as musicians, but...

549
00:43:52,968 --> 00:43:56,930
the more popular we get,
the bigger their houses get...

550
00:43:57,055 --> 00:43:59,892
the more responsibilities,
the pressure, you know--

551
00:43:59,975 --> 00:44:02,728
The harder it gets
for me to walk out on them.

552
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:04,187
What am I doing?

553
00:44:05,689 --> 00:44:11,068
I'm telling secrets to the one guy
you don't tell secrets to.

554
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,491
We'll do the interview tomorrow.

555
00:44:22,954 --> 00:44:26,833
So tonight, it's--
Well, friends.

556
00:44:26,958 --> 00:44:29,625
- Yeah, right.
- We trust ya.

557
00:45:13,373 --> 00:45:14,708
Stinking Rhodes!

558
00:45:16,668 --> 00:45:20,047
- Hey, what's going on?
- Russell just got electrocuted!

559
00:45:20,130 --> 00:45:23,382
Come on! Let's get on the bus!
Let's go!

560
00:45:23,507 --> 00:45:26,218
This is bullshit, man.
Who's taking care of us?

561
00:45:26,302 --> 00:45:28,304
- Who's responsible for the gear?
- I'm gonna deal with it.

562
00:45:28,387 --> 00:45:30,514
Get on the bus!
Please, everyone!

563
00:45:30,598 --> 00:45:32,850
- Let's go!
- Hey, cowboy.

564
00:45:32,933 --> 00:45:34,976
- You the manager of this band?
- That and more!

565
00:45:35,101 --> 00:45:36,977
You didn't finish
your full set, man.

566
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:40,814
Listen, pal. Your shoddy stage setup
almost killed my guitarist!

567
00:45:40,939 --> 00:45:44,069
You trashed my fucking dressing room,
and you didn't do your 25 minutes.

568
00:45:44,194 --> 00:45:47,362
-Don't fuck with my band's safety, ever!
-Fuck you, man!

569
00:45:47,487 --> 00:45:50,782
I'm gonna report you
to every promoter in this country!

570
00:45:50,865 --> 00:45:53,451
What is that?
What are you, Bruce Lee?

571
00:45:53,576 --> 00:45:55,745
Lock the gates!

572
00:45:55,870 --> 00:45:58,038
- Motherfucker!
- Let's go through the fucking gate.

573
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:00,041
That's your last
fucking tour, man!

574
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,334
Lock the gates
on these fuckheads!

575
00:46:02,459 --> 00:46:05,003
- Where's my goddamn cart?
- William?

576
00:46:09,048 --> 00:46:11,759
I forgot to tell you.
Your mom called.

577
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:14,302
She says you gotta
call home immediately.

578
00:46:14,386 --> 00:46:18,182
And she says to tell you,
'' I know what's going on.''

579
00:46:18,265 --> 00:46:20,308
So, I'll see you guys
in Topeka, okay?

580
00:46:25,981 --> 00:46:27,231
Amateurs!

581
00:46:27,314 --> 00:46:30,734
You don't know who you're
dealing with here! Lock the gates!

582
00:46:36,198 --> 00:46:39,450
- You wanna buy a gate?
- Yeah!

583
00:46:42,828 --> 00:46:44,788
You just bought a gate!

584
00:47:03,931 --> 00:47:05,307
Russell, wake up.

585
00:47:07,475 --> 00:47:09,519
Wake up, man.
High school girls.

586
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:12,147
Goddamn!

587
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,858
Let it go.
Let it go, buddy.

588
00:47:14,941 --> 00:47:17,151
When do we get in to Topeka, man?

589
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:20,320
- Larry, you're a sick individual.
- Wake up, man.

590
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:24,032
Look at all these fucking
tasty-looking high school girls.

591
00:47:24,157 --> 00:47:27,660
We can't stop the bus
every time you see a girl in shorts.

592
00:47:27,785 --> 00:47:30,288
Hey, when we go to Morocco...

593
00:47:30,413 --> 00:47:32,789
I think we should wear
completely different clothes...

594
00:47:32,873 --> 00:47:35,167
and be completely different people.

595
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:38,127
What will our names be?

596
00:47:47,219 --> 00:47:49,137
What do you think of Russell?

597
00:47:51,681 --> 00:47:53,183
I like him.

598
00:47:53,224 --> 00:47:56,770
But that's between us.
Because I am a professional.

599
00:47:56,895 --> 00:48:00,314
- You're coming to Cleveland, right?
- Oh, no.

600
00:48:02,524 --> 00:48:06,403
I have to get my interview
with Russell before Greenville.

601
00:48:06,487 --> 00:48:09,990
- You've got to help me, okay?
- Here's the thing about Russell.

602
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:11,657
He's my last project.

603
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:16,329
I only do this for a very few people,
and I think we should do it together.

604
00:48:16,454 --> 00:48:19,916
Because all the guys are good,
but he could be great.

605
00:48:23,043 --> 00:48:25,211
What's your real name?

606
00:48:30,883 --> 00:48:32,802
All right, let's go!

607
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:40,976
Oh, it's okay.
I'm easy to forget.

608
00:48:41,017 --> 00:48:42,852
just leave me behind!

609
00:48:42,936 --> 00:48:46,146
I'm only the fucking lead singer!

610
00:48:48,774 --> 00:48:52,319
- You said you'd tell me where you were.
- Mom, I know!

611
00:48:52,444 --> 00:48:54,989
You told me you would
call me twice a day.

612
00:48:55,113 --> 00:48:57,782
- You told me you wouldn't miss tests.
- I'll be home for graduation.

613
00:48:57,907 --> 00:48:59,867
- Mom--
- Where are you?

614
00:48:59,951 --> 00:49:02,953
Right now, Topeka.
Then Greenville, then home.

615
00:49:03,036 --> 00:49:06,039
What about graduation?
We had an agreement, William.

616
00:49:06,163 --> 00:49:08,417
I'm sorry I didn't
call you yesterday.

617
00:49:08,542 --> 00:49:10,544
I guess I just miss you,
and I don't understand...

618
00:49:10,669 --> 00:49:12,587
why I've driven my two kids
so far away from me.

619
00:49:12,671 --> 00:49:15,590
By all practical rules,
don't I get you for another three years?

620
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:19,217
Was I not fun?

621
00:49:19,342 --> 00:49:20,593
Yes.

622
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,471
This is Beth from Denver.

623
00:49:23,555 --> 00:49:26,684
She's one of the legendary,
original Band Aids.

624
00:49:26,809 --> 00:49:29,852
- She's clairvoyant!
- I can't read your mind or anything.

625
00:49:29,935 --> 00:49:32,938
I mean, I pick up things
here and there.

626
00:49:33,063 --> 00:49:34,815
Estrella says hi.

627
00:49:34,940 --> 00:49:38,610
- She says I can stay in your room.
- Sure.

628
00:49:38,694 --> 00:49:41,029
Great. I've got some...

629
00:49:41,154 --> 00:49:43,489
hydroponic pot!

630
00:49:43,615 --> 00:49:47,035
Wow, your aura
is really fantastic!

631
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:50,330
- It's this beautiful purple color.
- I love you.

632
00:49:50,413 --> 00:49:52,289
I missed the last thing you said.

633
00:49:52,414 --> 00:49:55,042
- Your aura is purple!
- I love you.

634
00:49:55,124 --> 00:49:57,585
- What?
- Purple! It's purple!

635
00:49:57,710 --> 00:50:00,797
- Mom, what?
- Your aura is purple.

636
00:50:00,922 --> 00:50:03,299
I miss you and I love you!

637
00:50:03,424 --> 00:50:05,301
I love you.

638
00:50:21,815 --> 00:50:25,944
All right.
Fire away. I'm ready.

639
00:50:26,069 --> 00:50:28,446
Do you have to be depressed
to write a sad song?

640
00:50:28,571 --> 00:50:30,448
Do you have to be in love
to write a love song?

641
00:50:30,573 --> 00:50:33,911
Is the song better
if it really happened to you?

642
00:50:34,036 --> 00:50:38,705
Like '' Love Thing.'' Where did you
write that? Who is it about?

643
00:50:40,332 --> 00:50:42,209
When did you get
so professional?

644
00:50:44,294 --> 00:50:48,254
Gentlemen, your first
T-shirts have arrived.

645
00:51:09,108 --> 00:51:13,070
It's the record company's mistake,
and they will pay.

646
00:51:14,404 --> 00:51:17,865
T-shirts are gone.
Band happy, all right?

647
00:51:20,158 --> 00:51:24,329
Can we just skip the vibe, and go
straight to us laughing about this?

648
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:25,540
Yeah, okay.

649
00:51:25,623 --> 00:51:27,958
Because I can see by your face
you want to get into it.

650
00:51:28,000 --> 00:51:31,168
How can you tell?
I'm just one of the out-of-focus guys.

651
00:51:32,795 --> 00:51:35,256
Here. Take it.

652
00:51:35,339 --> 00:51:37,758
Let's take a good look at it,
all right?

653
00:51:39,427 --> 00:51:41,803
See, you love this T-shirt.

654
00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:44,055
It lets you say
everything you want to say.

655
00:51:44,139 --> 00:51:47,058
Well, it speaks
pretty loudly to me.

656
00:51:47,142 --> 00:51:49,227
It's a T-shirt.

657
00:51:51,146 --> 00:51:53,062
Do you give a shit
about a T-shirt?

658
00:51:53,187 --> 00:51:56,899
I'm just hungry, man. Let's just go out
and find some barbecue or something.

659
00:51:57,025 --> 00:51:58,986
I'm always gonna
tell you the truth.

660
00:51:59,069 --> 00:52:01,947
From the very beginning,
we said I'm the front man...

661
00:52:02,031 --> 00:52:04,657
and you're the guitarist
with mystique.

662
00:52:04,782 --> 00:52:06,783
That's the dynamic we agreed on.

663
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:10,245
Page, Plant, Mick, Keith--

664
00:52:10,370 --> 00:52:12,956
but somehow it's all turning around.

665
00:52:13,081 --> 00:52:15,625
We have got to control
what's happening!

666
00:52:15,708 --> 00:52:18,961
- There's a responsibility here.
- Excuse me.

667
00:52:19,086 --> 00:52:22,673
Didn't we all get into this
to avoid responsibility?

668
00:52:22,715 --> 00:52:24,634
I can't say any more
with the writer here.

669
00:52:26,259 --> 00:52:28,136
You can trust him.
Say what you want.

670
00:52:28,219 --> 00:52:30,138
He won't write it.

671
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:34,768
I work as hard, or harder,
than anybody on that stage.

672
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,562
You know what I do?
I connect.

673
00:52:38,646 --> 00:52:40,606
I get people off!.

674
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:43,651
I look for the one guy
who isn't getting off...

675
00:52:43,776 --> 00:52:46,235
and I make him get off.

676
00:52:46,361 --> 00:52:48,278
Actually, that you can print!

677
00:52:49,696 --> 00:52:54,202
And yet, why do I always end up
feeling like I'm a joke to you?

678
00:52:55,203 --> 00:52:58,956
You want to pretend this isn't
gonna be a very big band? Well, it is!

679
00:52:59,081 --> 00:53:01,457
You call yourself
a leader of this band...

680
00:53:01,582 --> 00:53:04,210
but your direction
allowed this T-shirt...

681
00:53:04,335 --> 00:53:06,504
when you allowed Dick
to manage us.

682
00:53:06,629 --> 00:53:09,758
'Cause he's your friend!

683
00:53:09,883 --> 00:53:12,592
Don't you see, man?
The T-shirt is everything.

684
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:14,135
Is it my turn now?

685
00:53:14,261 --> 00:53:17,347
Because I think we should, for once,
say what we really mean.

686
00:53:17,430 --> 00:53:21,226
- This is the part where you quit!
- Right. I'm so predictable.

687
00:53:21,268 --> 00:53:22,977
Deal with it.

688
00:53:23,102 --> 00:53:24,979
And let me say
what nobody else wants to say.

689
00:53:25,104 --> 00:53:27,940
- What?
- Your looks have become a problem!

690
00:53:29,024 --> 00:53:31,360
All right, enough!
Break it up.

691
00:53:31,485 --> 00:53:34,112
Everyone out of the room
for five minutes.

692
00:53:37,698 --> 00:53:40,409
Hey! Yeah.
William. Sorry.

693
00:53:43,162 --> 00:53:45,372
Come on, man. Come on.

694
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:48,000
Let's go find something real.

695
00:53:55,213 --> 00:53:58,466
From here on out, I'm only interested
in what is real.

696
00:53:58,592 --> 00:54:00,636
Real people, real feelings.
That's it.

697
00:54:00,761 --> 00:54:03,555
That's all I'm interested in
from here on out.

698
00:54:05,390 --> 00:54:07,266
You're real.

699
00:54:08,392 --> 00:54:10,394
- Thanks.
- You know...

700
00:54:10,477 --> 00:54:13,897
you know all about us,
and I don't know shit about you.

701
00:54:16,066 --> 00:54:18,026
Tell me,
what's your family like?

702
00:54:20,820 --> 00:54:23,072
My dad died of a heart attack...

703
00:54:23,156 --> 00:54:25,575
and my sister believes
that my mom is so intense...

704
00:54:25,700 --> 00:54:28,160
that she had to escape our family...

705
00:54:28,285 --> 00:54:30,828
and they can't seem to find
a way to get through it.

706
00:54:30,953 --> 00:54:32,830
I mean, they don't even speak
to each other anymore.

707
00:54:32,956 --> 00:54:37,085
Plus, she gave me all her albums,
and now she's a stewardess?

708
00:54:40,838 --> 00:54:42,756
It's good to talk about.

709
00:54:43,798 --> 00:54:47,427
Really good.
But here I am telling secrets...

710
00:54:47,552 --> 00:54:49,638
to the one guy youre not supposed to
tell your secrets to.

711
00:54:55,101 --> 00:54:56,769
You're Russell from Stillwater.

712
00:54:58,562 --> 00:55:01,940
Well, yeah, on my better days,
I am Russell from Stillwater.

713
00:55:02,023 --> 00:55:04,359
Hey, you wanna go to a party with me
at my friend Aaron's house?

714
00:55:04,442 --> 00:55:06,110
I mean, I know you're
a big rock star and all...

715
00:55:06,194 --> 00:55:10,406
but do you wanna hang with some good
people looking to have a good time?

716
00:55:11,491 --> 00:55:15,118
- We're just real Topeka people, man.
- Smoke some righteous weed.

717
00:55:34,136 --> 00:55:36,845
- Thanks.
- You too.

718
00:55:36,971 --> 00:55:39,974
Oh, my God! Holy shit!

719
00:55:40,099 --> 00:55:42,644
Fuck!
I grew up with that lamp shade.

720
00:55:42,769 --> 00:55:46,689
I love this kitchen.
I fucking love this kitchen!

721
00:55:54,279 --> 00:55:56,989
That's William over there.
Hey, William!

722
00:55:59,325 --> 00:56:03,495
You, Aaron,
are what it's all about.

723
00:56:04,329 --> 00:56:06,290
You're real.

724
00:56:06,331 --> 00:56:10,543
Your room is real.
Your friends are real.

725
00:56:10,668 --> 00:56:14,087
Real, man, real.
You know? Real.

726
00:56:18,009 --> 00:56:20,343
Real. You know?

727
00:56:23,346 --> 00:56:28,601
You're more important
than all the silly machinery.

728
00:56:29,351 --> 00:56:31,603
Silly machinery.
And you know it!

729
00:56:33,022 --> 00:56:36,567
I n eleven years, it's gonna be 1 984,
man. Think about that!

730
00:56:38,068 --> 00:56:39,944
Wanna see me feed a mouse
to my snake?

731
00:56:40,069 --> 00:56:41,445
Yes.

732
00:56:47,618 --> 00:56:51,039
Russell, we should probably
get back with the others.

733
00:56:51,164 --> 00:56:53,039
- Oh, it's over, daddy.
- Hey...

734
00:56:53,164 --> 00:56:57,960
there's acid in the beer
that's in the red cups.

735
00:56:59,545 --> 00:57:01,464
That's wonderful.

736
00:57:03,215 --> 00:57:05,091
Topeka. Check it out.

737
00:57:05,216 --> 00:57:09,679
Please, don't give him any more acid.
Thank you.

738
00:57:09,763 --> 00:57:12,641
Dick? Dick, I got him.

739
00:57:12,724 --> 00:57:14,558
He's okay.

740
00:57:14,642 --> 00:57:16,894
He is on acid, though.

741
00:57:16,977 --> 00:57:21,940
I can't really tell.
How do you know when it's kicked in?

742
00:57:22,023 --> 00:57:24,401
I am a golden god!

743
00:57:26,402 --> 00:57:27,779
Yes, you are!

744
00:57:28,696 --> 00:57:33,033
- I am a golden god!
- Hey, Russell!

745
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:34,910
Dont jump.

746
00:57:36,453 --> 00:57:38,996
And you can tell
Rolling Stone magazine...

747
00:57:39,080 --> 00:57:42,459
that my last words...

748
00:57:42,542 --> 00:57:43,961
were...

749
00:57:48,838 --> 00:57:50,090
I'm on drugs.

750
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,018
I think we should work
on those last words!

751
00:58:03,102 --> 00:58:05,396
Okay. Oh, I got it, I got it.
I got it.

752
00:58:05,521 --> 00:58:08,440
I got it. I got it.
This is better.

753
00:58:08,524 --> 00:58:11,650
Last words.

754
00:58:11,733 --> 00:58:14,987
I dig music.

755
00:58:17,740 --> 00:58:19,284
I'm on drugs!

756
00:58:23,620 --> 00:58:25,371
Look, just come on down...

757
00:58:25,496 --> 00:58:28,457
and we'll go back to the hotel.

758
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:29,792
Okay.

759
00:58:29,875 --> 00:58:31,377
-j ump.
-j ump!

760
00:58:39,634 --> 00:58:40,552
Save Russell!

761
00:58:48,475 --> 00:58:52,730
They've been crying for you
like a bunch of whimpering pussies.

762
00:58:52,855 --> 00:58:54,230
Oh, this band's over.

763
00:58:54,314 --> 00:58:57,150
- This is my family now.
- That's right.

764
00:58:57,233 --> 00:58:59,235
- Right, man.
- Definitely.

765
00:58:59,360 --> 00:59:02,947
- He's staying with us.
- Let's just ride on down to Greenville.

766
00:59:03,031 --> 00:59:06,157
We'll listen to some great music.
We'll finish the tour...

767
00:59:06,282 --> 00:59:09,786
and then we'll leave
those ungrateful fools behind.

768
00:59:09,870 --> 00:59:12,122
Then we'll come back here,
where you'll live.

769
00:59:12,247 --> 00:59:15,250
- That sounds good.
- Yeah, and he can stay in our basement.

770
00:59:15,375 --> 00:59:19,336
-I see what you're doing, and I like it.
-Okay, good.

771
00:59:19,461 --> 00:59:21,755
Come on.

772
00:59:21,880 --> 00:59:24,174
- I got it, man, I got it.
- Yeah.

773
00:59:24,299 --> 00:59:26,677
That felt kind a good, though.

774
00:59:27,928 --> 00:59:29,678
Excuse me, kids.

775
00:59:29,762 --> 00:59:33,557
Look at him.
He's taking notes with his eyes.

776
00:59:33,682 --> 00:59:35,976
How do we know
you're not a cop? Huh?

777
00:59:36,060 --> 00:59:39,395
The Enemy?
Stop fucking looking at me!

778
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,397
Easy. Easy.

779
00:59:41,523 --> 00:59:44,859
Don't worry. He only means half
of what he says.

780
00:59:44,984 --> 00:59:46,694
Which half?

781
00:59:46,819 --> 00:59:48,696
Dick, just help me get
my interview.

782
00:59:48,821 --> 00:59:51,281
- I have to go home, Dick.
- Okay, okay.

783
00:59:51,406 --> 00:59:53,450
- I have to go home.
- Look.

784
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:57,578
You saved the tour, and that's
good enough for now, all right?

785
00:59:57,703 --> 01:00:00,165
- Come on, big fell, let's go.
- I hurt the flower.

786
01:00:00,290 --> 01:00:04,710
Did you, man? You hurt the flower?
That's nice. Come on, on the bus.

787
01:00:10,840 --> 01:00:14,468
Ladies and gentlemen,
the evening is over!

788
01:00:14,593 --> 01:00:16,638
We hope you all enjoyed yourselves.

789
01:00:16,763 --> 01:00:21,392
And we'll see you all again in 1 974.
Good evening!

790
01:01:14,355 --> 01:01:18,192
Handing' tickets out for God

791
01:01:20,569 --> 01:01:23,864
Turning 'back

792
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:26,992
She just laughs

793
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:31,287
The boulevard is not that bad

794
01:01:34,081 --> 01:01:37,043
Piano man

795
01:01:37,168 --> 01:01:39,545
He makes his stand

796
01:01:40,669 --> 01:01:44,174
In the auditorium

797
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:50,263
Lookin 'on

798
01:01:50,388 --> 01:01:53,348
She sings her songs

799
01:01:53,473 --> 01:01:57,018
The words she knows
the tune she hums

800
01:02:07,569 --> 01:02:11,865
Hold me closer, tiny dancer

801
01:02:12,866 --> 01:02:14,325
I have to go home.

802
01:02:14,408 --> 01:02:19,288
Count the headlights on the highway

803
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,082
You are home.

804
01:02:21,165 --> 01:02:25,377
Lay me down in the sheets of linen

805
01:02:27,420 --> 01:02:29,548
You had a busy day today

806
01:02:36,345 --> 01:02:38,264
In Carl Jung's opinion...

807
01:02:38,389 --> 01:02:41,767
we all have a sixth sense--
intuition.

808
01:02:41,850 --> 01:02:44,603
When you meet someone and you suddenly
feel like you can't live without them...

809
01:02:44,687 --> 01:02:49,106
this could be the memory of a past love
from the collective unconscious.

810
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,110
Or, it could just be hormones.

811
01:02:55,613 --> 01:02:58,573
I'm sorry, I can't concentrate.

812
01:02:58,698 --> 01:03:02,118
Rock stars have kidnapped my son.

813
01:03:09,834 --> 01:03:12,419
Lester, Rolling Stone is calling me.

814
01:03:12,544 --> 01:03:15,213
I don't have my key interview.
I don't know what to say.

815
01:03:15,338 --> 01:03:16,882
Days are just going by out here.

816
01:03:17,007 --> 01:03:21,385
You're flipping out. It's good.
All right.

817
01:03:21,510 --> 01:03:24,304
This is how you blow their minds.
He's gonna ask you--

818
01:03:24,430 --> 01:03:27,099
- This is Ben Fong-Torres, right?
- Yeah, yeah.

819
01:03:27,224 --> 01:03:29,310
He 's gonna ask you
how the storys going...

820
01:03:29,435 --> 01:03:31,145
and this is what you do.

821
01:03:31,228 --> 01:03:33,605
Tell him...

822
01:03:33,730 --> 01:03:36,649
you know, it's a--
it's a think-piece...

823
01:03:37,399 --> 01:03:40,068
Think-piece.

824
01:03:40,194 --> 01:03:42,405
about a mid-level band...

825
01:03:42,530 --> 01:03:44,781
struggling with
their own limitations...

826
01:03:44,865 --> 01:03:48,076
in the, you know,
harsh face of stardom.

827
01:03:48,160 --> 01:03:50,620
Harsh... face--

828
01:03:50,703 --> 01:03:53,581
Yeah, he'll wet himself.

829
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,459
All dressed up and no place to go.

830
01:03:57,542 --> 01:04:00,755
Greenville--
I'm bored.

831
01:04:10,054 --> 01:04:11,972
I have to pee.

832
01:04:12,056 --> 01:04:13,974
Let's deflower the kid.

833
01:04:22,690 --> 01:04:26,361
Whoa, hold on, hold on.
Wait.

834
01:04:26,486 --> 01:04:30,780
I should leave. I think
things are going backwards for me.

835
01:04:30,905 --> 01:04:33,742
- Backwards?
- Well, I don't know. I just--

836
01:04:33,825 --> 01:04:38,204
I thought maybe we could hang out,
you know, do some stuff back home...

837
01:04:38,329 --> 01:04:39,747
like regular stuff...

838
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:42,374
get to know each other
a little bit better...

839
01:04:42,499 --> 01:04:44,417
and then I'd see you pee.

840
01:04:44,543 --> 01:04:48,171
I mean, you know, that's just the way
I usually do it.

841
01:04:48,296 --> 01:04:50,215
You're one of us.

842
01:04:50,298 --> 01:04:52,008
If you come to Cleveland...

843
01:04:52,133 --> 01:04:54,803
Bowie's gonna be at Swingo's,
the greatest hotel in America.

844
01:04:54,928 --> 01:04:58,973
I'll introduce you to him
and his security guard, Dennis.

845
01:04:59,098 --> 01:05:01,057
Don't you have any regular friends?

846
01:05:02,308 --> 01:05:04,894
Famous people
are just more interesting.

847
01:05:06,187 --> 01:05:09,023
Well, I would be worried
that they were using me.

848
01:05:10,984 --> 01:05:13,360
Boy, if this was the real world...

849
01:05:13,485 --> 01:05:15,529
- Not that anybody's using you!
- and some guy talked to me like that--

850
01:05:15,654 --> 01:05:17,197
No. Hold on.

851
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:22,576
I'm not famous. But--

852
01:05:22,701 --> 01:05:26,497
- Your time has come!
- Did Russell call?

853
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:28,749
- Deflower.
- Opie must die.

854
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:32,461
- Pants him, girls.
- Stop. We're talking.

855
01:05:32,545 --> 01:05:35,296
Opie must die.

856
01:05:37,882 --> 01:05:40,009
- Okay.
- No, come on!

857
01:05:42,554 --> 01:05:48,266
No, come on, please.
Guys, come on, I have to write.

858
01:06:09,368 --> 01:06:10,703
Baby, yes.

859
01:06:13,622 --> 01:06:16,083
Come on, Penny, join us.

860
01:06:35,017 --> 01:06:38,229
Take a vacation from yourself.
Leave this up to professionals.

861
01:06:38,312 --> 01:06:39,812
Don't worry, William.

862
01:06:39,896 --> 01:06:44,733
I've seen the future,
and this all works out reasonably well.

863
01:06:44,858 --> 01:06:46,985
Reasonably?

864
01:06:52,865 --> 01:06:54,575
Hello?

865
01:06:54,659 --> 01:06:59,455
Hello. This is Ben Fong-Torres
calling from Rolling Stone.

866
01:06:59,539 --> 01:07:02,499
Hi, Ben Fong-Torres
from Rolling Stone.

867
01:07:02,624 --> 01:07:04,668
Hello, hello.

868
01:07:04,793 --> 01:07:07,921
- You have such a sexy voice.
- Hello, Ben.

869
01:07:08,046 --> 01:07:12,968
William Miller, this is your editor
from Rolling Stone. How's the story?

870
01:07:13,093 --> 01:07:15,678
I'm getting good stuff out here.

871
01:07:15,803 --> 01:07:18,930
- Yeah, it sounds like it.
- Man, I need some--

872
01:07:23,810 --> 01:07:27,397
Now listen.
Get it together, man.

873
01:07:27,522 --> 01:07:30,358
We're both professionals here, okay?
I don't need to tell you this.

874
01:07:30,441 --> 01:07:33,777
You're not out there to join the party.
We already have one Hunter Thompson.

875
01:07:33,902 --> 01:07:36,779
You're out there to interview
and report. You got me?

876
01:07:36,863 --> 01:07:39,699
Now, this isn't Creem magazine.
This is Rolling Stone.

877
01:07:39,824 --> 01:07:43,162
We need this story in four days.
Now I wanna know how it's shaping up.

878
01:07:47,998 --> 01:07:50,667
It's a think-piece
about a mid-level band...

879
01:07:50,750 --> 01:07:54,212
struggling with their own limitations
in the harsh face of stardom.

880
01:07:55,297 --> 01:07:56,464
That's great.

881
01:07:58,966 --> 01:08:01,385
I like what we're saying.

882
01:08:01,510 --> 01:08:03,470
Let me try and get you
a thousand more words.

883
01:08:03,596 --> 01:08:06,307
Now, it's in consideration
for the cover...

884
01:08:06,390 --> 01:08:09,475
but don't tell the band.

885
01:08:09,601 --> 01:08:13,687
The cover of Rolling Stone magazine.
Crazy.

886
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:16,024
Crazy.

887
01:08:16,107 --> 01:08:17,567
Some coffee.

888
01:08:17,650 --> 01:08:21,820
Me too.
Greenville is so boring.

889
01:08:21,904 --> 01:08:25,031
You know, any other city
in the world...

890
01:08:25,114 --> 01:08:26,574
and you'd still be a virgin.

891
01:08:26,699 --> 01:08:30,745
- Oh, God. Oh, God.
- What?

892
01:08:30,870 --> 01:08:34,207
I've never written anything more
than a few pages in my whole life.

893
01:08:34,290 --> 01:08:35,917
Don't worry, baby, you will.

894
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:39,920
I gotta find Russell.
I gotta find Russell.

895
01:08:40,003 --> 01:08:41,421
Oh, will you take the laundry?

896
01:08:42,880 --> 01:08:44,256
Take the laundry?

897
01:08:45,508 --> 01:08:48,427
What am I to you?
Huh? Tell me.

898
01:08:48,552 --> 01:08:53,224
Tell me right now.
What am I to you?

899
01:08:56,309 --> 01:08:58,686
Excuse me, sir,
would you mind signing for this?

900
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,688
Good morning.

901
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,993
Please go the fuck away!

902
01:10:11,001 --> 01:10:13,961
Hey, how you doing?

903
01:10:14,086 --> 01:10:15,504
Hi.

904
01:10:17,632 --> 01:10:19,593
Oh, my God!

905
01:10:19,718 --> 01:10:22,552
Hi, welcome to Swingo's Celebrity Inn.
You must be Stillwater.

906
01:10:22,635 --> 01:10:24,137
It's Bowie!

907
01:10:48,909 --> 01:10:53,122
Hi, Mom. I'm in Cleveland.
Oh, I'm fine, I'm fine.

908
01:10:53,206 --> 01:10:55,624
I'm gonna fly back Monday morning.

909
01:10:57,792 --> 01:10:59,961
No, no, no,
I'll only miss one test.

910
01:11:00,045 --> 01:11:01,629
I'll be back for graduation.

911
01:11:01,712 --> 01:11:04,006
Tell her youre a slave to the groove.
You cant help it.

912
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:13,599
Hey, Mom, it's Russell Hammond.
I play guitar in Stillwater.

913
01:11:13,723 --> 01:11:15,850
Hey, how does it feel
to be the mother of the greatest...

914
01:11:15,934 --> 01:11:18,310
rock journalist we've met?

915
01:11:20,687 --> 01:11:21,897
Hello?

916
01:11:25,109 --> 01:11:27,736
Look, you got a great kid here.
There's nothing to worry about.

917
01:11:27,861 --> 01:11:31,656
We're taking good care of him.
You should come to the show sometime.

918
01:11:31,781 --> 01:11:34,033
- Hey, listen to me, mister.
-join the circus.

919
01:11:34,158 --> 01:11:37,328
Your charm doesn't work on me.
I'm onto you.

920
01:11:37,453 --> 01:11:39,330
Oh, of course you like him.

921
01:11:39,455 --> 01:11:42,249
Well, yeah.

922
01:11:42,374 --> 01:11:43,917
He worships you people.

923
01:11:44,042 --> 01:11:46,419
And that's fine by you
as long as he helps make you rich.

924
01:11:46,503 --> 01:11:50,674
- Rich? I don't think so. We sit--
- Listen to me.

925
01:11:50,799 --> 01:11:54,008
He 's a smart, good-hearted
15-year-old kid...

926
01:11:54,134 --> 01:11:55,552
with infinite potential.

927
01:11:57,178 --> 01:11:59,723
This is not some apron-wearing mother
you're speaking to.

928
01:11:59,849 --> 01:12:03,017
I know about your Valhalla decadence,
and I shouldn't have let him go.

929
01:12:03,143 --> 01:12:05,894
He's not ready for your world
of compromised values...

930
01:12:06,019 --> 01:12:08,522
and diminished brain cells
that you throw away like confetti.

931
01:12:08,605 --> 01:12:09,857
Am I speaking to you clearly?

932
01:12:09,982 --> 01:12:12,442
- Yes, ma'am.
- If you break his spirit...

933
01:12:12,568 --> 01:12:14,277
harm him in any way...

934
01:12:14,402 --> 01:12:16,613
keep him from his chosen profession,
which is law...

935
01:12:16,697 --> 01:12:18,365
something you may not value,
but I do...

936
01:12:18,490 --> 01:12:21,284
you will meet the voice
at the other end of this telephone.

937
01:12:21,409 --> 01:12:25,078
And it will not be pretty.
Do we understand each other?

938
01:12:25,162 --> 01:12:28,123
- Uh, yes, ma'am.
- I didn't ask for this role...

939
01:12:28,206 --> 01:12:30,125
but I'll play it.

940
01:12:31,501 --> 01:12:34,045
Now go do your best.

941
01:12:34,171 --> 01:12:37,047
'' Be bold and mighty forces
will come to your aid.''

942
01:12:37,173 --> 01:12:39,049
Goethe said that.

943
01:12:40,843 --> 01:12:44,305
It's not too late for you to become
a person of substance, Russell.

944
01:12:44,430 --> 01:12:46,847
Please get my son home safely.

945
01:12:48,390 --> 01:12:50,810
You know, I'm glad we spoke.

946
01:12:56,608 --> 01:12:59,942
Song and pong
it sounds like lots of fun

947
01:13:00,067 --> 01:13:04,447
Won't you get on my back
for piggyback ride

948
01:13:04,572 --> 01:13:09,952
Get on my back
for piggyback ride

949
01:13:11,203 --> 01:13:13,663
- All right, boys.
- All right.

950
01:13:17,417 --> 01:13:19,835
Your mom kind of freaked me out.

951
01:13:21,504 --> 01:13:23,422
She means well.

952
01:13:27,426 --> 01:13:31,304
From Troy, Michigan...

953
01:13:31,429 --> 01:13:35,141
would you please welcome
to Cleveland...

954
01:13:36,267 --> 01:13:39,686
Stillwater!

955
01:13:44,107 --> 01:13:47,528
Father, Father

956
01:13:49,446 --> 01:13:54,783
Tell me the story
tell me what to do

957
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:05,876
Doctor, Doctor

958
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:13,801
Is there a cure
for the young man's broken blues

959
01:14:15,845 --> 01:14:19,305
And he said

960
01:14:22,058 --> 01:14:25,478
Everybody knows

961
01:14:45,454 --> 01:14:47,873
Yeah, you had to be there

962
01:14:52,544 --> 01:14:54,045
Girl, you had to be there

963
01:15:02,844 --> 01:15:05,680
Did you see that chick's shirt
in front of Russell?

964
01:15:05,805 --> 01:15:08,058
When you play a great show
like tonight--

965
01:15:08,142 --> 01:15:10,059
Okay, I need everyone's attention,
please.

966
01:15:10,143 --> 01:15:13,103
Girls, I need five minutes
with the band alone.

967
01:15:13,228 --> 01:15:18,233
Right.
Well, it seems the rumors are true.

968
01:15:18,358 --> 01:15:21,195
The record company has sent
a big-time manager here...

969
01:15:21,320 --> 01:15:23,236
to try and talk you
into replacing me.

970
01:15:23,361 --> 01:15:26,616
His name is Dennis Hope.
I know you've all heard of him.

971
01:15:26,741 --> 01:15:29,035
He's got all the big bands,
and he's outside right now...

972
01:15:29,160 --> 01:15:31,120
and he wants five minutes with you.

973
01:15:31,204 --> 01:15:33,955
And, well, I think
we've gotta do this.

974
01:15:36,332 --> 01:15:37,750
- Well, send him in.
- Yeah, bring him in.

975
01:15:37,875 --> 01:15:41,253
- We'll send him out on a rail!
- All right.

976
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:44,590
We'll finish the interview in Maryland.
You can fly home from Maryland, okay?

977
01:15:49,761 --> 01:15:52,680
Hey, we've already got a manager.
He's been with us from the beginning.

978
01:15:52,806 --> 01:15:55,140
Respectfully.
We all have our roots.

979
01:15:55,265 --> 01:15:57,476
I believe in bands
holding on to their roots.

980
01:15:57,559 --> 01:15:59,104
Those roots need to be augmented.

981
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:02,981
Your manager here
needs a manager.

982
01:16:03,065 --> 01:16:06,359
Example-- if you hadn't have run out
on your contract in Phoenix...

983
01:16:06,400 --> 01:16:09,070
we could have sued
over Russell's hand.

984
01:16:09,195 --> 01:16:12,907
But you left, negating the contract,
forfeiting the deposit.

985
01:16:13,032 --> 01:16:16,619
You effectively traveled a long way
to pay that promoter to electrocute you.

986
01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:20,122
Okay, your damages have put you
way in the hole for this tour.

987
01:16:20,247 --> 01:16:21,832
Right now, you owe the record company
more than you've got.

988
01:16:23,166 --> 01:16:25,252
But your record's selling.
There's money to be made.

989
01:16:25,335 --> 01:16:28,711
So I brought a plane in. We could add
more shows to make up the difference.

990
01:16:28,795 --> 01:16:32,549
- Respectfully.
- We travel by bus.

991
01:16:32,632 --> 01:16:34,343
Doris is the soul of this band.

992
01:16:34,427 --> 01:16:38,097
That bus has been our home since
we were the Jeff Bebe band. No way.

993
01:16:38,222 --> 01:16:41,515
Hey, man, I'd travel on a pogo stick
if I thought we could make more money.

994
01:16:41,598 --> 01:16:43,183
You could play more dates
with a plane.

995
01:16:43,267 --> 01:16:47,229
Well, it's not about money. It's about
playing music and turning people on.

996
01:16:47,312 --> 01:16:49,648
Clearly. Respectfully.

997
01:16:49,731 --> 01:16:51,692
Why should we pay you for something
we can do ourselves?

998
01:16:51,775 --> 01:16:53,192
Do you know how to keep
from getting charged...

999
01:16:53,276 --> 01:16:56,988
for the ice below the floorboards
at Chicago Stadium?

1000
01:16:57,113 --> 01:16:58,823
Do you know how to do
a headlining tour?

1001
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:02,784
Do you know how to get a record
not pressed, but played?

1002
01:17:02,909 --> 01:17:06,871
You gotta take what you can,
when you can, while you can...

1003
01:17:06,954 --> 01:17:08,373
and you gotta do it now.

1004
01:17:08,457 --> 01:17:11,168
That's what the big boys do.

1005
01:17:11,293 --> 01:17:12,835
Because if you think Mick Jagger'll
still be out there...

1006
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:17,715
trying to be a rock star at age 50,
you're sadly, sadly mistaken.

1007
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:21,426
I didn't invent the rainy day, man.
I just own the best umbrella.

1008
01:17:22,510 --> 01:17:26,473
I'm telling you, you're coming along at
a very dangerous time for rock and roll.

1009
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:29,017
The war is over.
They won...

1010
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:31,019
and they will ruin rock and roll...

1011
01:17:31,144 --> 01:17:34,521
and strangle everything
we love about it.

1012
01:18:17,185 --> 01:18:20,187
Put 'em up.
All right, money down.

1013
01:18:20,312 --> 01:18:23,357
One guy says, '' I'll draw a picture
and you guess what it is, all right?''

1014
01:18:25,191 --> 01:18:27,360
- Can I help you?
- Is Russell Hammond here?

1015
01:18:27,443 --> 01:18:29,195
Hey, the Enemy!
Come on in, son.

1016
01:18:33,241 --> 01:18:35,910
Welcome to the road manager
poker party.

1017
01:18:36,035 --> 01:18:40,539
This game's been going on for two years.
Come on, find a spot.

1018
01:18:40,622 --> 01:18:42,581
- This is Mick. He's with The Who.
- How you doing?

1019
01:18:42,706 --> 01:18:45,918
This is Raymond. He's with the Eagles.
This is Reg. He's with Humble Pie.

1020
01:18:46,001 --> 01:18:47,378
- I think you know Red Dog.
- Hey, brother!

1021
01:18:48,587 --> 01:18:50,714
We've been developing this system
of poker over the years...

1022
01:18:50,840 --> 01:18:53,049
- so you can play it in any condition.
- Any.

1023
01:18:53,174 --> 01:18:55,135
- All right, I'm in.
- All right, all right.

1024
01:18:55,218 --> 01:18:58,430
Side proposition to the winner.

1025
01:18:58,555 --> 01:19:00,598
For 50 bucks and a case of Heineken...

1026
01:19:00,723 --> 01:19:02,642
I'll throw into the pot
three lovely ladies...

1027
01:19:02,767 --> 01:19:05,601
including Miss Penny Lane
and the famous Band Aids...

1028
01:19:05,685 --> 01:19:10,607
who have to leave the tour
before New York.

1029
01:19:10,732 --> 01:19:13,485
- Is that okay with you?
- Russ is getting soft on us.

1030
01:19:14,736 --> 01:19:18,530
- Is that okay?
- Okay.

1031
01:19:18,613 --> 01:19:20,991
- It's a deal.
- Show 'em.

1032
01:19:22,451 --> 01:19:25,371
Three lovely ladies
in the custody of Humble Pie.

1033
01:19:25,455 --> 01:19:29,999
- Be good to 'em, Rich.
- We owe you $50 and a case of Heineken.

1034
01:19:30,124 --> 01:19:31,208
All right.

1035
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:34,587
-joint?
-You know how I know this is good stuff?

1036
01:19:34,670 --> 01:19:36,338
- How's that?
- This is from Crosby.

1037
01:19:36,464 --> 01:19:38,882
- Is that the Crosby weed?
- Yeah, this is from Crosby.

1038
01:19:38,965 --> 01:19:41,886
- Oh, I'm in.
- I'm in.

1039
01:19:44,095 --> 01:19:45,930
Give me this.
Give me a light. I want fire.

1040
01:19:46,055 --> 01:19:49,683
Look, nobody's feelings
are getting hurt here.

1041
01:19:49,767 --> 01:19:51,685
She already knows that Leslie's coming
to New York tomorrow.

1042
01:19:51,769 --> 01:19:53,937
Everybody understands.

1043
01:19:54,062 --> 01:19:57,106
This is the circus.
Everybody's trying not to go home.

1044
01:19:57,231 --> 01:20:00,359
- Nobody's saying good-bye.
- Would you like some?

1045
01:20:00,443 --> 01:20:01,986
- I may.
- How many?

1046
01:20:02,111 --> 01:20:06,199
- Quit looking at me like that.
- You think you can fool me.

1047
01:20:06,324 --> 01:20:10,659
I can read you.
I know what you're thinking.

1048
01:20:10,785 --> 01:20:14,830
- What's that?
- You're worried about me and Russell.

1049
01:20:18,043 --> 01:20:20,504
Yeah, I gotta work on that.

1050
01:20:20,629 --> 01:20:23,254
You're so sweet.

1051
01:20:23,338 --> 01:20:27,050
God, if there was more of you in him.

1052
01:20:27,133 --> 01:20:31,054
Don't tell me this stuff.
I wanna like him.

1053
01:20:33,932 --> 01:20:35,349
Did you miss your test or something?

1054
01:20:37,434 --> 01:20:41,688
- You have no idea.
- Look, I know I'm not on the plane.

1055
01:20:41,772 --> 01:20:43,648
I'm not going
on some other band's bus.

1056
01:20:43,773 --> 01:20:46,442
I could go with the Stillwater road crew
but that would be pathetic...

1057
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:48,527
and the girls are all going
with Humble Pie.

1058
01:20:49,861 --> 01:20:52,365
So, if you could find out
from Russell--

1059
01:20:53,491 --> 01:20:55,367
Forget it.
I'm flying to New York myself.

1060
01:20:55,492 --> 01:20:58,286
I've got a bunch of partial tickets.
I know his ex-wife...

1061
01:20:58,412 --> 01:20:59,830
current-girlfriend thing
is gonna be there.

1062
01:20:59,955 --> 01:21:01,914
I'm not sure that's a good idea.

1063
01:21:01,997 --> 01:21:06,251
What are you saying?
Did Russell say something?

1064
01:21:06,376 --> 01:21:10,339
- I don't know anything.
- Well, I know he wants me there.

1065
01:21:10,423 --> 01:21:14,342
Wake up!
Don't go to New York.

1066
01:21:15,260 --> 01:21:18,429
- Why are you yelling at me?
- I thought we were going to Morocco.

1067
01:21:18,554 --> 01:21:21,682
There is no Morocco.
There's never been a Morocco.

1068
01:21:21,765 --> 01:21:24,226
There's not even a Penny Lane.

1069
01:21:24,310 --> 01:21:26,854
I don't even know
your real name.

1070
01:21:26,979 --> 01:21:29,897
If I ever met a man
in the real world...

1071
01:21:29,981 --> 01:21:31,524
who looked at me
the way you just looked at me--

1072
01:21:31,649 --> 01:21:35,319
When and where
does this '' real world'' occur?

1073
01:21:35,403 --> 01:21:39,531
I mean, I am really confused here.
All these rules...

1074
01:21:39,614 --> 01:21:41,992
and all these sayings and nicknames.

1075
01:21:42,117 --> 01:21:46,538
Honey, you're too sweet
for rock and roll.

1076
01:21:46,621 --> 01:21:50,541
Sweet? Where do you get off?

1077
01:21:50,666 --> 01:21:52,543
Where do you get sweet?

1078
01:21:52,668 --> 01:21:55,295
I am dark and mysterious
and pissed off!.

1079
01:21:55,420 --> 01:21:58,214
And I could be very dangerous
to all of you.

1080
01:21:58,298 --> 01:22:00,426
I am not sweet!

1081
01:22:00,509 --> 01:22:04,721
And you should know that about me.
I am the Enemy!

1082
01:22:04,846 --> 01:22:06,972
Look, you should be happy for me.

1083
01:22:07,097 --> 01:22:09,683
You don't know
what he says to me in private.

1084
01:22:09,767 --> 01:22:13,061
Maybe it is love,
as much as it can be for somebody--

1085
01:22:13,186 --> 01:22:16,899
Who sold you to Humble Pie
for 50 bucks and a case of beer?

1086
01:22:17,816 --> 01:22:19,650
I was there.

1087
01:22:19,776 --> 01:22:22,570
I was there!

1088
01:22:29,117 --> 01:22:31,036
Oh, God.

1089
01:22:35,372 --> 01:22:37,333
I'm sorry.

1090
01:22:50,512 --> 01:22:52,889
What kind of beer?

1091
01:23:09,612 --> 01:23:12,072
Welcome to New York!
It's okay to be nervous.

1092
01:23:12,114 --> 01:23:15,534
You should be nervous.
All you can do is be yourself...

1093
01:23:15,659 --> 01:23:17,577
and leave a pint of blood
on that stage.

1094
01:23:18,911 --> 01:23:22,289
We showed you America.
We did everything but get you laid.

1095
01:23:35,510 --> 01:23:36,886
No. Yeah?

1096
01:23:57,112 --> 01:24:00,908
I'm from the Church of Lenny. We bow
to his will and all it represents.

1097
01:24:02,201 --> 01:24:04,076
She's here.

1098
01:24:09,415 --> 01:24:11,500
- Can I have your autograph?
- Yep.

1099
01:24:13,669 --> 01:24:16,671
- How you doing?
-Jeffrey.

1100
01:24:16,755 --> 01:24:20,175
Room's fully stocked.
Air-conditioning's on.

1101
01:24:20,300 --> 01:24:22,385
- And, by the way, you look stunning.
- Thanks. See you later.

1102
01:24:22,469 --> 01:24:24,387
All right, bags in five!

1103
01:24:24,512 --> 01:24:27,514
Cars leave for the party at 6:00.

1104
01:24:30,475 --> 01:24:33,604
It's all happening.
They're here.

1105
01:24:33,729 --> 01:24:35,773
Zeppelin are here.
They are here.

1106
01:24:35,856 --> 01:24:37,607
They're at the Plaza.

1107
01:24:37,732 --> 01:24:42,611
Sapphire and Miss Penny Lane
are there too.

1108
01:24:42,694 --> 01:24:46,740
They're all staying under the name
Emily Rugburn.

1109
01:24:46,823 --> 01:24:48,240
Wait. Penny Lane is here?

1110
01:24:48,324 --> 01:24:51,703
- Emily Rugburn.
- William Miller.

1111
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:54,206
Sir, you have an urgent call.

1112
01:24:57,375 --> 01:25:00,585
Hello? This is Jan Winner,
publisher of Rolling Stone.

1113
01:25:00,710 --> 01:25:02,420
Congratulations,
it's gonna be a cover.

1114
01:25:02,504 --> 01:25:05,131
Annie Liebowitz'll shoot 'em
next week in LA...

1115
01:25:05,215 --> 01:25:08,344
but we are gonna need you
back in San Francisco tomorrow.

1116
01:25:08,427 --> 01:25:11,053
You can finish the story here.
Okay? Talk to Ben.

1117
01:25:11,178 --> 01:25:15,015
You can tell the band. Alison, our
fact-checker, needs you to transmit...

1118
01:25:15,099 --> 01:25:18,435
whatever you have of the story tonight,
now, along with your notes.

1119
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:21,062
There's a mojo at the Daily News
they'll let us use.

1120
01:25:21,187 --> 01:25:22,437
A mojo?

1121
01:25:22,562 --> 01:25:27,652
A mojo. It's a very modern machine
that transmits pages over the telephone.

1122
01:25:27,735 --> 01:25:30,697
It only takes 1 8 minutes a page.

1123
01:25:30,738 --> 01:25:34,449
Guys, I have some good news.

1124
01:25:34,574 --> 01:25:37,243
- I don't know why every time I'm here--
- Guys!

1125
01:25:37,368 --> 01:25:42,207
What's the problem?
I subscribe to the magazine.

1126
01:25:42,290 --> 01:25:43,499
Fish.

1127
01:25:45,042 --> 01:25:48,002
You're gonna be on the cover
of Rolling Stone.

1128
01:25:49,921 --> 01:25:51,589
Are you serious?

1129
01:25:53,091 --> 01:25:54,466
The cover of Rolling Stone.

1130
01:25:56,635 --> 01:25:58,596
And we made it together.

1131
01:26:00,265 --> 01:26:02,433
- And they dont just put somebody...
- Thanks a lot.

1132
01:26:02,516 --> 01:26:06,686
with one little hit on the cover
of Rolling Stone...

1133
01:26:06,769 --> 01:26:10,356
fucking magazine, man!

1134
01:26:10,481 --> 01:26:14,776
Damn it, I'm gonna enjoy this.
When I first bought the magazine...

1135
01:26:14,901 --> 01:26:17,487
the Beatles were on the cover.

1136
01:26:17,612 --> 01:26:22,200
The Beatles.
Four of them, four of us.

1137
01:26:22,284 --> 01:26:25,370
We take all kind of pills
that give us all kind of thrills

1138
01:26:25,454 --> 01:26:30,290
But the thrill we never know
was the thrill that'll get you

1139
01:26:30,373 --> 01:26:35,463
When you get your picture
on the cover of Rolling Stone

1140
01:26:36,589 --> 01:26:39,883
Wanna see my picture
on the cover

1141
01:26:39,965 --> 01:26:42,634
Gonna buy five copies
for my mother

1142
01:26:42,760 --> 01:26:47,306
Wanna see my smiling face
on the cover

1143
01:26:47,389 --> 01:26:49,183
Of Rolling Stone

1144
01:26:52,394 --> 01:26:53,686
Thank you!

1145
01:26:55,980 --> 01:27:00,401
Who is that girl?
She's creeping me out.

1146
01:27:00,485 --> 01:27:02,235
She's not with any of you guys,
is she?

1147
01:27:02,319 --> 01:27:04,237
- Yeah, she's with me.
- She's with me.

1148
01:27:14,246 --> 01:27:17,041
So, uh, who's gonna shoot it?

1149
01:27:18,501 --> 01:27:20,377
- I love Annie Liebowitz.
- Real impressive.

1150
01:27:20,502 --> 01:27:23,128
I love Annie's stuff.
She does great stuff.

1151
01:29:04,552 --> 01:29:07,431
I am no good at good-byes.

1152
01:29:08,849 --> 01:29:10,851
And you...

1153
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:15,605
are the last of my...

1154
01:29:15,688 --> 01:29:18,106
old-time friends.

1155
01:29:19,274 --> 01:29:21,193
Polexia--

1156
01:29:21,276 --> 01:29:25,197
Polexia went to England
with Deep Purple.

1157
01:29:25,322 --> 01:29:27,532
Can you believe that?

1158
01:29:27,657 --> 01:29:30,910
Even Sapphire went someplace else.

1159
01:29:30,951 --> 01:29:33,371
All she left was her Quaaludes.

1160
01:29:35,998 --> 01:29:37,457
Oh, wonderful.

1161
01:29:37,582 --> 01:29:39,626
Where's Beth?

1162
01:29:42,129 --> 01:29:44,172
Where are all my friends?

1163
01:29:44,297 --> 01:29:48,759
Front desk?
Could you please send a doctor?

1164
01:29:48,842 --> 01:29:50,302
Room 537.

1165
01:29:50,427 --> 01:29:53,722
- Penny, get up!
- I'm up.

1166
01:29:53,847 --> 01:29:58,184
My wife's had an accident
with some Quaaludes.

1167
01:29:58,267 --> 01:30:02,480
- So tired.
- You gotta get up, Penny.

1168
01:30:02,563 --> 01:30:05,233
- Penny, get up. Get up.
- I'm so--

1169
01:30:05,358 --> 01:30:08,902
You know that.
You know that I'm retired.

1170
01:30:10,486 --> 01:30:15,742
Always been.
Am retired, and I'm tired.

1171
01:30:15,826 --> 01:30:19,204
-Jane Abbott.
- Missjane Abbott.

1172
01:30:23,748 --> 01:30:24,791
Congratulations!

1173
01:30:25,917 --> 01:30:27,836
Miss Judy Stanton.

1174
01:30:29,921 --> 01:30:31,839
Congratulations.

1175
01:30:33,174 --> 01:30:36,927
- Raymond Sanchez.
- Mr. Raymond Sanchez.

1176
01:30:37,011 --> 01:30:39,430
- As time goes on
- Seats and tray tables.

1177
01:30:39,555 --> 01:30:43,349
Seat back
and tray tables locked.

1178
01:30:43,474 --> 01:30:48,937
And our pending graduate,
William Miller, not present.

1179
01:30:57,487 --> 01:30:59,865
Why doesn't he love me?

1180
01:31:08,497 --> 01:31:11,083
And to the class of1973...

1181
01:31:11,167 --> 01:31:16,628
we say, don't forget to remember
yourselves as you are today.'

1182
01:31:16,754 --> 01:31:19,340
full of hope
and the dream...

1183
01:31:19,381 --> 01:31:22,051
- that everything is possible.
- Penny, no!

1184
01:31:22,176 --> 01:31:23,719
- Wake up!
- And remember this...

1185
01:31:23,844 --> 01:31:27,263
- I'm up.
- 20years from now.

1186
01:31:27,388 --> 01:31:32,018
Well, now that I have your attention...

1187
01:31:33,311 --> 01:31:37,982
I know you've heard this before,
and I've never said this to anybody.

1188
01:31:38,107 --> 01:31:41,777
Well, nobody who didn't legally
have to say it back to me.

1189
01:31:43,028 --> 01:31:44,738
But--

1190
01:31:44,821 --> 01:31:47,240
Oh, God, why am I so nervous?

1191
01:31:47,366 --> 01:31:50,159
You'll never remember this.

1192
01:31:50,284 --> 01:31:52,912
I love you...

1193
01:31:52,995 --> 01:31:57,540
and I'm about to boldly go where...

1194
01:31:57,666 --> 01:32:00,794
many men have gone before.

1195
01:32:09,468 --> 01:32:12,178
Okay, what do we got here?
What's her name?

1196
01:32:12,303 --> 01:32:14,597
Okay, sweetheart,
sit up, sit up, sit up, sit up.

1197
01:32:14,722 --> 01:32:17,101
-Good girl. What'd you take, sweetheart?
-I'll get her legs.

1198
01:32:17,226 --> 01:32:19,435
- What did you take?
- Okay.

1199
01:32:19,560 --> 01:32:21,104
-What did you take, sweetheart? Come on.
-I don't know.

1200
01:32:21,229 --> 01:32:24,272
Yes, you do.
Tell us what you took.

1201
01:32:24,398 --> 01:32:26,858
Emily, we're gonna have
to pump your stomach, okay?

1202
01:32:26,984 --> 01:32:31,863
- Emily, wake up.
- We got the tubes. Here we go. Water.

1203
01:32:31,989 --> 01:32:34,532
All right, now, you're gonna
have to swallow this tube.

1204
01:32:34,615 --> 01:32:36,909
All right? Open, open, open.

1205
01:32:37,034 --> 01:32:39,954
- All right, come on.
- Don't bite us. We're trying to help.

1206
01:32:40,079 --> 01:32:43,374
- Relax.
- Come on, swallow. Swallow.

1207
01:32:43,457 --> 01:32:44,958
- Come on. I know, I know.
- We're trying to help you.

1208
01:32:45,083 --> 01:32:47,126
Swallow this down.
No, don't bite on it. Don't bite.

1209
01:32:47,209 --> 01:32:49,461
Swallow. Emily, come on.
Swallow.

1210
01:32:49,545 --> 01:32:52,340
-just relax. Got it.
- Very good.

1211
01:32:52,465 --> 01:32:53,717
There we go. All done.

1212
01:32:53,800 --> 01:32:56,510
All done. There.

1213
01:32:56,593 --> 01:32:57,886
Now we gotta--
Come on.

1214
01:32:57,970 --> 01:33:00,888
Feed some liquid
into your stomach.

1215
01:33:25,828 --> 01:33:29,497
So I guess
what I'm trying to say is...

1216
01:33:29,622 --> 01:33:33,668
I've done twice the things
I said I've done.

1217
01:33:33,793 --> 01:33:35,670
What about your mom?

1218
01:33:38,714 --> 01:33:41,382
She always said, '' Marry up.

1219
01:33:41,508 --> 01:33:44,511
Marry someone grand.''

1220
01:33:44,636 --> 01:33:47,514
And that's why she named me '' Lady.''

1221
01:33:49,475 --> 01:33:51,350
She named you '' Lady'' ?

1222
01:33:52,934 --> 01:33:55,729
Lady Goodman.

1223
01:33:56,605 --> 01:34:00,026
Lady Goodman-- that's great.

1224
01:34:00,151 --> 01:34:04,528
Now you know all my secrets.
You've got me.

1225
01:34:07,448 --> 01:34:09,367
See you back in the real world.

1226
01:34:10,826 --> 01:34:14,371
Thank you, William Miller.

1227
01:34:25,089 --> 01:34:28,717
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
Eastern Airlines nonstop service...

1228
01:34:28,801 --> 01:34:30,551
to San Diego.

1229
01:34:30,677 --> 01:34:32,972
In preparation
for our departure today...

1230
01:34:33,097 --> 01:34:37,475
we'd like to ask, please, that
you extinguish all flammable items...

1231
01:34:37,558 --> 01:34:40,311
and do return all seats and tray tables
to their full--

1232
01:34:41,729 --> 01:34:44,606
May I have your attention, please?

1233
01:34:47,316 --> 01:34:50,237
...that your seatbelts
are securely fastened.

1234
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:53,240
And do make note
of the emergency exits.

1235
01:35:50,498 --> 01:35:53,542
Why didn't you come back to the party
last night? Bob Dylan showed up.

1236
01:35:53,626 --> 01:35:56,295
He was sitting at our table for what had
to be an hour or something, right, Dick?

1237
01:35:56,420 --> 01:35:57,880
- Yeah.
-just rapping.

1238
01:35:58,005 --> 01:36:01,508
Bob Dylan at our fucking table.
I was looking for you.

1239
01:36:01,592 --> 01:36:04,219
- I was gonna introduce you.
- What happened to you last night?

1240
01:36:04,345 --> 01:36:06,971
It's a long story.

1241
01:36:12,143 --> 01:36:15,145
Peggy Sue, Peggy Sue

1242
01:36:15,187 --> 01:36:17,814
Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty
Peggy Sue

1243
01:36:17,939 --> 01:36:19,483
Hi, this is Craig, your pilot.

1244
01:36:19,608 --> 01:36:21,568
It appears we've caught the edge
of that electrical storm...

1245
01:36:21,652 --> 01:36:22,986
- we were trying to outrun.
- Oh, my God.

1246
01:36:23,070 --> 01:36:25,364
- Electrical storm?
- So buckle up tight now.

1247
01:36:25,447 --> 01:36:26,531
- We 're gonna do our best here.
- Rock and roll.

1248
01:36:26,615 --> 01:36:28,740
We shouldn't be here.

1249
01:36:29,824 --> 01:36:32,410
- Oh, my God!
- Whoa, baby!

1250
01:36:36,207 --> 01:36:37,791
Doris, we miss you!

1251
01:36:40,584 --> 01:36:43,754
All right, listen.
We're gonna try and land in Tupelo.

1252
01:36:43,879 --> 01:36:46,715
- We found a field to land in.
- A field?

1253
01:36:46,840 --> 01:36:48,258
I can't breathe, man.

1254
01:36:48,342 --> 01:36:51,345
It's gonna be kind of a rough set-down,
but we should be fine.

1255
01:36:51,428 --> 01:36:54,430
just hang in there,
and we'll get you out of this.

1256
01:36:58,559 --> 01:37:02,562
Everyone says
it's so glamorous out here.

1257
01:37:02,646 --> 01:37:05,065
- He just told us we're gonna die.
- We're gonna die?

1258
01:37:05,190 --> 01:37:06,774
...Thy will be done on Earth--

1259
01:37:06,857 --> 01:37:08,860
I'm trying to maintain,
but the fucking thing won't--

1260
01:37:10,862 --> 01:37:11,946
Oh, my God!

1261
01:37:14,490 --> 01:37:19,078
If something should happen--
Maybe I never said this enough.

1262
01:37:20,203 --> 01:37:21,871
I love all of you.

1263
01:37:28,670 --> 01:37:32,548
I once hit a man in Dearborn, Michigan.
A hit and run.

1264
01:37:32,673 --> 01:37:37,593
I hit him and just kept on going.
I don't know if he's alive or dead...

1265
01:37:37,719 --> 01:37:39,220
but I'm sorry.

1266
01:37:39,345 --> 01:37:41,473
Not a day goes by
I don't see his face.

1267
01:37:41,598 --> 01:37:45,018
Oh, my God!

1268
01:37:45,059 --> 01:37:48,937
Look, I love you all too.
You're like a family to me.

1269
01:37:49,062 --> 01:37:50,939
Especially since Marna left me.
And listen, fellas...

1270
01:37:51,064 --> 01:37:54,484
I just want you to know, if I took
an extra dollar or two here and there...

1271
01:37:54,568 --> 01:37:56,444
it's because I knew I'd earned it.

1272
01:37:56,527 --> 01:37:59,697
- Yeah. I slept with Marna, Dick.
- I did too.

1273
01:37:59,739 --> 01:38:03,492
I waited until you broke up with her,
but me too.

1274
01:38:05,578 --> 01:38:08,997
I also slept with Leslie,
when you were fighting.

1275
01:38:09,080 --> 01:38:12,666
- You slept with Jeff?
- Yeah, but it didn't count.

1276
01:38:12,791 --> 01:38:15,461
It was the summer we decided
to be free of all rules.

1277
01:38:15,586 --> 01:38:17,838
And you say you love me!

1278
01:38:17,921 --> 01:38:20,341
I don't love you, man.
I never did.

1279
01:38:20,466 --> 01:38:22,635
None of us love you.

1280
01:38:22,760 --> 01:38:25,261
You act above us.
You always have.

1281
01:38:25,386 --> 01:38:27,096
Finally, the truth.

1282
01:38:27,221 --> 01:38:30,098
You just held it over us,
like you might leave.

1283
01:38:30,223 --> 01:38:34,103
Like we're lucky to be with you.
And we had to live with it, man.

1284
01:38:34,187 --> 01:38:36,189
I had to live with you.

1285
01:38:36,314 --> 01:38:40,024
And now I might die with you,
and it's not fucking fair.

1286
01:38:40,149 --> 01:38:41,400
Please, enough!

1287
01:38:44,820 --> 01:38:47,406
And I'm still in love with you,
Leslie.

1288
01:38:47,490 --> 01:38:50,327
Oh, I don't wanna hear any more.
Shut up, Jeffrey!

1289
01:38:51,326 --> 01:38:53,370
- It's all happening.
- What the fuck!

1290
01:38:53,453 --> 01:38:57,040
- Whatever happens, Bebe, you're dead.
- Don't be self-righteous, Russell.

1291
01:38:57,165 --> 01:38:58,625
Not now, man.

1292
01:38:58,708 --> 01:39:02,086
You were sleeping with Penny,
that fucking groupie...

1293
01:39:02,169 --> 01:39:03,920
last summer up until yesterday.

1294
01:39:04,003 --> 01:39:05,546
Why don't you tell Leslie that?

1295
01:39:05,672 --> 01:39:07,675
- Shut up!
- I quit!

1296
01:39:07,800 --> 01:39:09,927
- I'm gonna kill you!
- I quit!

1297
01:39:09,969 --> 01:39:11,720
''That groupie'' ?

1298
01:39:11,804 --> 01:39:16,349
She was a Band Aid.
All she did was love your band.

1299
01:39:16,432 --> 01:39:18,392
And you all used her.

1300
01:39:18,475 --> 01:39:21,812
All of you.
You used her and threw her away.

1301
01:39:21,937 --> 01:39:26,066
She almost died last night
while you were with Bob Dylan.

1302
01:39:26,191 --> 01:39:30,027
You guys, you're always talking
about the fans, the fans, the fans.

1303
01:39:30,111 --> 01:39:32,238
She was your biggest fan.

1304
01:39:32,363 --> 01:39:34,365
And you threw her away.

1305
01:39:34,448 --> 01:39:38,952
And if you can't see that,
that's your biggest problem.

1306
01:39:39,077 --> 01:39:41,539
And I love her!
I love her!

1307
01:39:51,422 --> 01:39:53,424
Fuck it!

1308
01:39:53,549 --> 01:39:56,551
I'm-- I'm gay!

1309
01:40:10,521 --> 01:40:14,942
Thank God, we're alive!
We're alive! We're gonna make it!

1310
01:40:15,067 --> 01:40:16,945
- We're out of the clear now.
- Sweet relief!.

1311
01:40:17,070 --> 01:40:19,905
Sweet life!
Hallelujah, dear God!

1312
01:40:19,989 --> 01:40:23,158
We made it. We're alive.

1313
01:41:27,924 --> 01:41:29,801
Write what you want.

1314
01:41:58,577 --> 01:41:59,786
You're William Miller?

1315
01:42:01,830 --> 01:42:04,499
- Yep.
- Oh, baby.

1316
01:42:06,625 --> 01:42:10,004
Didn't anything happen? I mean,
after $600 in room-service bills?

1317
01:42:10,087 --> 01:42:12,547
Didn't you get anything on tape
with Russell Hammond?

1318
01:42:12,630 --> 01:42:14,882
And where were you in this piece?
What did you wanna write?

1319
01:42:15,008 --> 01:42:17,219
Because this reads
like what they wanted you to write.

1320
01:42:17,303 --> 01:42:19,138
You obviously saw more
than you wrote about.

1321
01:42:19,263 --> 01:42:21,847
- Something must have happened.
- Let's push up Flippo's Who cover.

1322
01:42:21,930 --> 01:42:24,808
Good, 'cause it's gonna take me
three days to get through this research.

1323
01:42:24,933 --> 01:42:28,478
It's all handwritten
on little bits of paper.

1324
01:42:28,562 --> 01:42:31,315
- It's a puff-piece.
- They refer to the women as ''chicks.''

1325
01:42:31,440 --> 01:42:33,107
-As a woman, I have a problem with that.
-You want 'em to like you.

1326
01:42:33,232 --> 01:42:34,650
- I know it's a side issue.
- It happens.

1327
01:42:34,775 --> 01:42:38,946
- It's embarrassing.
- Ben! You told me to send what I had.

1328
01:42:39,071 --> 01:42:42,408
It's not finished.
Give me tonight to work on it.

1329
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:21,025
Oh, man, you made friends with 'em.

1330
01:43:22,652 --> 01:43:25,780
See, friendship is the booze
they feed you...

1331
01:43:25,863 --> 01:43:28,782
'cause they want you to get drunk
and feel like you belong.

1332
01:43:28,865 --> 01:43:31,493
Well, it was fun.

1333
01:43:31,618 --> 01:43:34,788
Because they make you feel cool.

1334
01:43:34,913 --> 01:43:39,874
- And, hey, I met you. You are not cool.
- I know.

1335
01:43:39,958 --> 01:43:43,337
Even when I thought I was,
I knew I wasn't.

1336
01:43:43,379 --> 01:43:46,840
Because we are uncool.

1337
01:43:46,966 --> 01:43:50,510
While women will always be
a problem for guys like us...

1338
01:43:50,593 --> 01:43:55,347
most of the great art in the world
is about that very problem.

1339
01:43:55,430 --> 01:43:58,851
Good-looking people--
they got no spine.

1340
01:43:58,935 --> 01:44:01,937
Their art never lasts.

1341
01:44:02,020 --> 01:44:04,105
They get the girls,
but we're smarter.

1342
01:44:06,232 --> 01:44:10,236
- Yeah, I can really see that now.
- Yeah, 'cause great artist about...

1343
01:44:10,319 --> 01:44:12,321
you know, guilt and longing...

1344
01:44:12,405 --> 01:44:15,323
and, you know,
love disguised as sex...

1345
01:44:15,407 --> 01:44:17,409
and sex disguised as love.

1346
01:44:17,534 --> 01:44:21,955
Hey, let's face it.
You got a big head start.

1347
01:44:22,038 --> 01:44:23,290
I'm glad you were home.

1348
01:44:23,415 --> 01:44:26,250
I'm always home.
I'm uncool.

1349
01:44:26,375 --> 01:44:29,587
- Me too.
- You're doing great, you know?

1350
01:44:29,670 --> 01:44:32,338
The only true currency
in this bankrupt world...

1351
01:44:32,463 --> 01:44:36,050
is what you share with someone else
when you're uncool.

1352
01:44:36,134 --> 01:44:39,387
Listen, my advice to you--

1353
01:44:39,512 --> 01:44:42,807
and I know you think
these guys are your friends--

1354
01:44:42,931 --> 01:44:44,933
if you wanna be a true friend to them...

1355
01:44:45,058 --> 01:44:50,105
be honest and unmerciful.

1356
01:44:52,649 --> 01:44:55,611
'' I'm flying high
over Tupelo, Mississippi...

1357
01:44:55,694 --> 01:44:58,236
with America's hottest band...

1358
01:44:58,361 --> 01:45:01,323
and we're all about to die.''

1359
01:45:01,448 --> 01:45:05,035
- Dark, lively.
- Yeah, yeah, and it gets better.

1360
01:45:05,160 --> 01:45:08,580
- Did this all really happen?
- I'll call and check the quotes.

1361
01:45:11,665 --> 01:45:14,877
Holy shit! I just got off the phone
with Rolling Stone.

1362
01:45:14,960 --> 01:45:17,129
They called me too.
What's he using?

1363
01:45:17,212 --> 01:45:20,590
All-- he's using it all.
This, according to the ''fact-checker.''

1364
01:45:20,715 --> 01:45:22,382
So what?

1365
01:45:22,507 --> 01:45:25,803
''So what'' ?
We come off like amateurs...

1366
01:45:25,929 --> 01:45:30,183
some average band trying to come
to grips with success...

1367
01:45:30,266 --> 01:45:32,768
jealous and fighting
and breaking up.

1368
01:45:32,893 --> 01:45:34,978
We're buffoons.

1369
01:45:35,061 --> 01:45:37,605
'' Rock and roll can save the world'' ?

1370
01:45:37,688 --> 01:45:41,443
''The chicks are great'' ?
I sound like a dick.

1371
01:45:41,525 --> 01:45:44,028
- You are a dick.
- I never said that.

1372
01:45:44,153 --> 01:45:46,405
Maybe we just don't see ourselves
the way we really are.

1373
01:45:46,489 --> 01:45:50,700
Is it that hard
to make us look cool?

1374
01:45:50,825 --> 01:45:54,411
This kid has you on acid screaming,
'' I'm a golden god'' from a fan's rooftop.

1375
01:45:54,536 --> 01:45:59,000
They used him to fuck us. They'll
probably just put you on the cover.

1376
01:45:59,125 --> 01:46:01,335
Wait. I never said,
'' I'm a golden god.''

1377
01:46:03,920 --> 01:46:05,713
Or did I ?

1378
01:46:05,838 --> 01:46:09,300
He was never a person.
He was a journalist!

1379
01:46:09,425 --> 01:46:11,636
It's phenomenal, William,
to be quite honest with you.

1380
01:46:11,761 --> 01:46:14,887
It's sophisticated, intelligent. We
only had to cut out a couple of grafs.

1381
01:46:15,012 --> 01:46:18,016
Jeff Bebe's mother already sent over a
whole shoe box full of childhood photos.

1382
01:46:18,100 --> 01:46:20,477
- She did?
- But it's really gonna look fantastic.

1383
01:46:20,561 --> 01:46:25,482
The band just denied 90 percent
of the story. It's a fabrication.

1384
01:46:25,566 --> 01:46:29,234
You weren't honest.
And worse, you wasted our time.

1385
01:46:31,152 --> 01:46:33,239
Did you talk to Russell Hammond?

1386
01:46:33,322 --> 01:46:35,408
Russell Hammond is the one
who denied it.

1387
01:46:35,533 --> 01:46:37,617
- Now wait a second.
- Denied it.

1388
01:46:39,536 --> 01:46:42,538
We're going with The Who.
Manuscript's in my office.

1389
01:46:42,621 --> 01:46:44,873
He's just some fan.
What do you expect?

1390
01:46:44,999 --> 01:46:47,334
So, anyway, put those two pieces--

1391
01:46:47,459 --> 01:46:50,170
Wait!

1392
01:47:13,441 --> 01:47:15,484
You guys, this is my brother.

1393
01:47:15,610 --> 01:47:19,155
- Nice to finally meet you.
- You have a good day.

1394
01:47:20,405 --> 01:47:22,281
You guys, I'll deadhead back later.

1395
01:47:22,406 --> 01:47:24,451
I think I'm needed.

1396
01:47:26,494 --> 01:47:28,663
I'll see you.

1397
01:47:34,459 --> 01:47:39,130
You look awful, but it's great.

1398
01:47:39,255 --> 01:47:41,341
You're living your life.

1399
01:47:41,467 --> 01:47:44,510
You're free of Mom.

1400
01:47:47,846 --> 01:47:51,391
Hey, I'll take off work.

1401
01:47:51,433 --> 01:47:55,978
Let's have an adventure together--
you and me-- finally.

1402
01:47:56,062 --> 01:48:01,234
Anywhere you wanna go,
anywhere in the world.

1403
01:48:02,485 --> 01:48:04,570
This is not my idea of a good time.

1404
01:48:05,862 --> 01:48:08,156
-just get me to my bed.
- I'll deal with her.

1405
01:48:52,654 --> 01:48:54,781
I forgive you.

1406
01:48:56,825 --> 01:48:58,785
I didn't apologize.

1407
01:49:25,434 --> 01:49:27,352
I am out of here.

1408
01:49:32,023 --> 01:49:34,900
- Hey, Sapphire.
- Hey, boy.

1409
01:49:36,860 --> 01:49:39,237
- I hate good-byes.
- Me too.

1410
01:49:54,752 --> 01:49:57,002
Is Penny okay?

1411
01:49:58,128 --> 01:50:02,884
The Quaaludes incident?
Well, it wasn't pretty.

1412
01:50:03,009 --> 01:50:05,970
She could've died.

1413
01:50:06,095 --> 01:50:10,431
You know, I always told her not to let
too many guys fall in love with her.

1414
01:50:10,514 --> 01:50:13,226
I guess I was wrong.
One of them ended up saving her life.

1415
01:50:16,188 --> 01:50:20,024
What do you care? I mean,
we all know what you did to him.

1416
01:50:20,107 --> 01:50:23,360
I mean, everybody knows.

1417
01:50:23,485 --> 01:50:27,280
Even Penny Lane.

1418
01:50:34,996 --> 01:50:36,872
How you doing?

1419
01:50:40,042 --> 01:50:42,210
Can you believe these new girls?

1420
01:50:42,293 --> 01:50:45,838
None of them use birth control,
and they eat all the steak.

1421
01:50:46,965 --> 01:50:51,302
I mean, they don't even know
what it is to be a fan.

1422
01:50:51,427 --> 01:50:57,307
You know, to truly love some silly
little piece of music, or some band...

1423
01:50:57,391 --> 01:51:01,519
so much that it hurts.

1424
01:51:09,944 --> 01:51:12,280
It's Russell.
Dont hang up.

1425
01:51:12,405 --> 01:51:15,489
I cant really talk right now.
I'm in a room full of people.

1426
01:51:23,873 --> 01:51:28,293
Actually, I'm alone.

1427
01:51:28,418 --> 01:51:29,836
I won't call again, I promise.

1428
01:51:30,795 --> 01:51:33,464
But I need to see you face to face...

1429
01:51:33,548 --> 01:51:37,801
because I'm never as good
as when youre there...

1430
01:51:37,926 --> 01:51:43,098
and I can see myself
the way you look at me.

1431
01:51:43,182 --> 01:51:47,727
And I'm sorry. If we could just get
together and find some time to talk.

1432
01:51:53,065 --> 01:51:55,233
Let's say all the things
we never said.

1433
01:51:59,446 --> 01:52:00,864
Give me your address.

1434
01:52:03,366 --> 01:52:05,827
I'm coming to you...

1435
01:52:05,952 --> 01:52:08,704
this time.

1436
01:52:21,465 --> 01:52:23,383
Got a pen?

1437
01:52:58,332 --> 01:53:00,250
I'm Russell Hammond.

1438
01:53:01,668 --> 01:53:05,504
So this is the famous Russell Hammond.

1439
01:53:11,386 --> 01:53:13,303
Come in.

1440
01:53:18,558 --> 01:53:22,728
- Is she home?
- Who? Anita?

1441
01:53:30,610 --> 01:53:32,195
- Where am I ?
- Hello?

1442
01:53:34,698 --> 01:53:38,158
You know, when we spoke,
I felt that we connected.

1443
01:54:01,471 --> 01:54:03,890
Oh, man.

1444
01:54:11,480 --> 01:54:14,149
My son is very important to me too...

1445
01:54:14,232 --> 01:54:16,902
and I do think you owe him
an apology.

1446
01:54:17,861 --> 01:54:21,198
- I appreciate you showing up.
- No, no, I agree...

1447
01:54:21,323 --> 01:54:22,908
ma'am.

1448
01:54:26,160 --> 01:54:30,163
There's hope for you yet, Russell.

1449
01:54:44,426 --> 01:54:45,801
Well--

1450
01:54:54,102 --> 01:54:59,731
So this is...
where the Enemy sleeps.

1451
01:55:05,946 --> 01:55:09,573
You know, I think we both wanted to--
to be with her.

1452
01:55:14,495 --> 01:55:16,872
And she wanted us to be together.

1453
01:55:32,219 --> 01:55:34,638
You should give her a call.

1454
01:55:34,763 --> 01:55:36,597
You both live in the same city.

1455
01:55:41,811 --> 01:55:44,230
- You really think I should?
- Yeah.

1456
01:55:47,233 --> 01:55:49,150
That girl really cares about you.

1457
01:55:52,820 --> 01:55:54,780
Man, I never even knew her real name.

1458
01:56:01,912 --> 01:56:05,290
Oh, I called your magazine...

1459
01:56:05,373 --> 01:56:07,959
and told them the truth.

1460
01:56:09,836 --> 01:56:11,087
I don't know
what they're gonna do with it...

1461
01:56:11,171 --> 01:56:15,047
but I told them
every word you wrote was true.

1462
01:56:21,305 --> 01:56:25,391
We are gonna do this one more time.

1463
01:56:37,360 --> 01:56:38,612
So, Russell...

1464
01:56:41,697 --> 01:56:44,116
what do you love about music?

1465
01:56:54,375 --> 01:56:56,294
To begin with...

1466
01:56:57,754 --> 01:56:59,630
everything.

1467
01:57:07,221 --> 01:57:09,972
- Tickets!
- How much?

1468
01:57:26,029 --> 01:57:28,156
Morocco.
Seat by the window, please.
