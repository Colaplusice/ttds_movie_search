- Manuela, Ramn y Cajal Hospital.
- Yes.

5
00:02:20,648 --> 00:02:22,775
We've got a possible donor.

6
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:26,183
We've done the first EEG,
and the family has agreed.

7
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:28,347
Give me the details.

8
00:02:28,423 --> 00:02:31,085
Male, 35 years old.

9
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,456

10
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:35,428

- Dodotis!

15
00:03:02,256 --> 00:03:03,814
you won'tfeela drop!

16
00:03:09,197 --> 00:03:10,391
- Mom!
- What?

17
00:03:10,465 --> 00:03:12,092
The movie's starting.

18
00:03:12,166 --> 00:03:14,157
I'm coming.

19
00:03:19,607 --> 00:03:22,599
Eve Unveiled

20
00:03:22,677 --> 00:03:24,542
They always change the title!

21
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:27,046
''All About Eve'' should be
''Todo Sobre Eva.''

22
00:03:27,682 --> 00:03:29,616
But that sounds odd.

23
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,552
What areyou writing?

24
00:03:40,628 --> 00:03:41,993
Nothing.

25
00:03:43,297 --> 00:03:44,821
Future Pulitzerwinners.

26
00:03:44,899 --> 00:03:46,730
ALL ABOUT MY MOTHER

27
00:03:46,801 --> 00:03:49,269
Eat up. You have to put on
a few pounds.

28
00:03:49,337 --> 00:03:52,704
Some dayyou may have
to work the street to keep me.

29
00:03:53,174 --> 00:03:56,337
You don't need pounds for that.
You need a big dick.

30
00:03:57,078 --> 00:03:59,444
Where did you learn
to talk like that?

31
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,706
- You asked.
- I wasjoking.

32
00:04:05,186 --> 00:04:07,620
- And you?
- What about me?

33
00:04:07,688 --> 00:04:10,248
Would you prostituteyourself
for me?

34
00:04:11,793 --> 00:04:14,762
I've already done
just about everything foryou.

35
00:04:17,431 --> 00:04:19,126
Eat up!

36
00:04:20,334 --> 00:04:23,201
Autograph fiends!
They'renotpeople.

37
00:04:23,271 --> 00:04:25,967

They'rejuvenile delinquents,

Notatall.

47
00:04:47,862 --> 00:04:49,796
Margo,
this is Eve Harrington.

48
00:04:49,864 --> 00:04:52,264
- Howdoyoudo, my dear?
- Hello.

49
00:04:52,333 --> 00:04:54,699
Would you like to be
an actress?

50
00:04:54,769 --> 00:04:57,329
It was hard enough
becoming a nurse.

51
00:04:57,405 --> 00:04:59,896
Ifyou were an actress,
I'd write parts foryou.

52
00:05:00,708 --> 00:05:03,176
I was in an amateur group
when I was young.

53
00:05:03,244 --> 00:05:05,405
I wasn't bad.

54
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:07,447
I must have a picture
somewhere.

55
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,510
I'd love to see it.

56
00:05:11,185 --> 00:05:12,914
I'll look for it later.

57
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,987
Look, Esteban.

58
00:05:21,062 --> 00:05:23,155
I found a picture.

59
00:05:26,868 --> 00:05:30,133
We were doing a show
based on texts by Boris Vian.

60
00:05:31,105 --> 00:05:33,596
Cabaret for intellectuals.

61
00:05:46,387 --> 00:05:47,877
Happy birthday!

62
00:05:47,955 --> 00:05:50,719
- Already?
- It's midnight, sweetheart.

63
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,985
'' Music for Chameleons.''
How did you know I wanted it?

64
00:05:55,963 --> 00:05:57,624
I knowyou like Capote.

65
00:05:58,266 --> 00:06:00,257
Read me something,
like when I was little.

66
00:06:05,139 --> 00:06:06,766
''Preface.

67
00:06:07,942 --> 00:06:10,172
I started writing
when I was eight.''

68
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,405
See? I'm not the only one.

69
00:06:13,214 --> 00:06:15,739
''I didn't know
that I had chained myselffor life...

70
00:06:15,816 --> 00:06:18,751
to a noble
but merciless master.

71
00:06:18,819 --> 00:06:22,414
When God hands you a gift,
he also hands you a whip...

72
00:06:23,991 --> 00:06:27,654
and the whip is intended
only for self-flagellation.''

73
00:06:28,596 --> 00:06:30,757
That's enough
to putyou offwriting.

74
00:06:30,831 --> 00:06:32,696
Don't be so lame.

75
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:35,759
It's a wonderful preface.

76
00:06:35,836 --> 00:06:39,067
How doyou want
to celebrateyour birthday?

77
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,370
I'd like to see
one ofyour seminars.

78
00:06:41,442 --> 00:06:42,966
Why?

79
00:06:43,044 --> 00:06:46,070
I'm writing a story aboutyou
for a competition.

80
00:06:47,014 --> 00:06:51,451
And I'd like to seeyou act
in those organ donation courses.

81
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:54,682
Well, I'd have to check
with Mamen.

82
00:06:54,755 --> 00:06:56,950
She's the psychologist
in charge ofthe seminar.

83
00:06:57,024 --> 00:06:58,992
Fine. Do it.

84
00:07:00,428 --> 00:07:03,158
I don't think I likeyou writing
about me.

85
00:07:03,230 --> 00:07:05,721
Your husband is dead, ma'am.

86
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,098
That's impossible.

87
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,899
Wejust saw him in the ICU.
He seemed to be breathing.

88
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:15,432
We've explained that, ma'am.
A machine is breathing for him.

89
00:07:15,509 --> 00:07:18,501
Wouldyoulike us
to contactyour family?

90
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:21,077
Idon'thaveany family.

91
00:07:21,782 --> 00:07:23,909
Justmyson.

92
00:07:24,719 --> 00:07:27,517
MyGod!
Howam Igoing to tellhim?

93
00:07:27,588 --> 00:07:30,022
Whenhe wasalive,
didyourhusbandsayanything...

94
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:32,559
regardingorgan donation?

95
00:07:32,626 --> 00:07:35,459
Did he care about such matters?

96
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:37,895
When we was alive,
he cared only about living.

97
00:07:38,966 --> 00:07:43,062
But I presume he was concerned
with the lives ofothers.

98
00:07:43,838 --> 00:07:45,328
I don't understand.

99
00:07:45,406 --> 00:07:49,365
What my colleague means
is thatyour husband's organs...

100
00:07:49,443 --> 00:07:51,775
couldsave otherpatients'lives.

101
00:07:51,846 --> 00:07:54,440
But weneed
yourauthorization forthat.

102
00:07:54,515 --> 00:07:57,746
Youcouldgivehim
a transplant?

103
00:07:57,818 --> 00:08:01,219
Notexactly.
The other wayaround, actually.

104
00:08:10,831 --> 00:08:14,961
Now we'll discuss
what happened in the simulation.

105
00:08:58,412 --> 00:09:00,403
Lookwhen you cross the street!

106
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,747
- What wereyou thinking?
- I had an idea.

107
00:09:03,818 --> 00:09:06,184
An idea!
Give him the tickets.

108
00:09:11,492 --> 00:09:14,154
Whyareyoulookingatmelike that?
Do Ilookawful?

109
00:09:14,228 --> 00:09:17,026
No, youlookbetterthan ever.

110
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,693
Look, thatmustbe
thegentlemanyou were expecting.

111
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:23,134
You aren't Mr. Huntleigh!

112
00:09:24,238 --> 00:09:26,433
Neither areyou!

113
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:46,257
These fingernails will have
to be trimmed.

114
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,256
Thejacket, Doctor.

115
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,060
Ask her to let go ofme!

116
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:53,122
Please!

117
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:56,559
Let her go.

118
00:10:01,342 --> 00:10:03,572
Get up.

119
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:09,182
Lean on my arm...

120
00:10:09,850 --> 00:10:12,182
Miss DuBois.

121
00:10:12,253 --> 00:10:13,720
Thankyou.

122
00:10:13,787 --> 00:10:15,277
Whoeveryou are...

123
00:10:15,356 --> 00:10:19,520
I have always depended
on the kindness ofstrangers.

124
00:10:30,471 --> 00:10:32,803
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

125
00:10:32,873 --> 00:10:35,569
Don't touch me.
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

126
00:10:35,643 --> 00:10:37,440
Watch your language!

127
00:10:45,953 --> 00:10:47,978
Stella, come here.

128
00:10:51,692 --> 00:10:54,388
I'm never coming back
to this house.

129
00:10:57,264 --> 00:10:59,391
Never!

130
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:07,937
I'd like to get
Huma Rojo's autograph.

131
00:11:08,008 --> 00:11:11,637
- In this weather?
- What's that got to do with it?

132
00:11:18,752 --> 00:11:20,481
What ifnobody comes out?

133
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:23,717
Let's wait a while.
It's my birthday.

134
00:11:24,558 --> 00:11:27,254
Look, autumn's here already.

135
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:30,486
- So long.
- Seeyou tomorrow.

136
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:36,069
Nina Cruz really moved you,
didn't she?

137
00:11:36,136 --> 00:11:39,162
No, not her. Stella.

138
00:11:39,506 --> 00:11:43,875
Twentyyears ago, we did Streetcar
with the drama group in my town.

139
00:11:43,944 --> 00:11:46,208
I played Stella.

140
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,407
Your fatherwas Kowalski.

141
00:11:48,482 --> 00:11:51,679
Some dayyou'll have to tell me
all about my father.

142
00:11:51,752 --> 00:11:53,686
All I know is
he died before I was born.

143
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:56,780
- It isn't an easy story to tell.
- I guess not.

144
00:11:56,857 --> 00:11:59,519
Oryou'd have told me by now.

145
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:02,562
I nearly asked for that
as a birthday present.

146
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:04,598
I'm not sure
it would be a nice present.

147
00:12:04,665 --> 00:12:08,066
You're wrong.
It would be the best one.

148
00:12:10,704 --> 00:12:14,196
Then I'll tell you everything
when we get home.

149
00:12:16,243 --> 00:12:18,939
Working in theater
is worse than being a nun!

150
00:12:21,215 --> 00:12:24,946
You think not being able to get stoned
all day is being a nun!

151
00:12:25,019 --> 00:12:26,452
Yeah, I do!

152
00:12:28,088 --> 00:12:30,579
Alfonso XII Street, number 30.

153
00:12:33,961 --> 00:12:36,122
Come on, forget about it!

154
00:13:08,228 --> 00:13:10,128
My son!

155
00:13:37,791 --> 00:13:41,625

This is Lola, at Ramn y Cajal.

161
00:14:05,786 --> 00:14:08,346
Yes?

162
00:14:08,422 --> 00:14:10,913
We've got a possible donor.
He's in the ICU.

163
00:14:10,991 --> 00:14:12,686
They've done the first EEG...

164
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:15,456
but the mother hasn't given
her consentyet.

165
00:14:15,529 --> 00:14:17,121
Can I have the details?

166
00:14:17,197 --> 00:14:19,222
I don't have them.
It's Manuela's son.

167
00:14:19,299 --> 00:14:22,700
The Manuela that I know?
The coordinator?

168
00:14:23,137 --> 00:14:25,697
Yes. He's dead.
It's awful.

169
00:14:48,228 --> 00:14:49,957
Unfortunately...

170
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:57,264
the result ofthe EEG
is what we'd feared.

171
00:15:05,813 --> 00:15:08,441
We have to make a decision
immediately.

We have to go.
We have to call.

177
00:16:11,645 --> 00:16:15,206
- I'll do it. You calm down.
- I am calm-- but call them.

178
00:16:21,321 --> 00:16:25,257
ALVEDRO AI RPORT, CORUA

179
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,861
REGIONAL HOSPITAL, CORUA

180
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:18,876
THREE WEEKS LATER

181
00:17:24,651 --> 00:17:26,983
We're outside now,
sweetheart.

182
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:28,610
We're out at last.

183
00:17:28,689 --> 00:17:31,351
He looks great.
Who'd have believed it?

184
00:17:31,425 --> 00:17:33,416
He certainly didn't.

185
00:17:33,493 --> 00:17:35,290
I feel I can breathe
like before.

186
00:17:35,362 --> 00:17:37,990
- Even better.
- With an 1 8-year-old's heart!

187
00:17:38,065 --> 00:17:42,126
- I'll fixyou some apple fritters.
- No, he has to be careful.

188
00:17:45,339 --> 00:17:48,137
Lastnight, Momshowedme
apicture ofwhenshe wasyoung.

189
00:17:48,709 --> 00:17:50,734
Halfofit wasmissing.

190
00:17:50,811 --> 00:17:54,804
Ididn't want to tellher,
butmylife ismissing thatsamehalf.

191
00:18:10,364 --> 00:18:12,628
I was worried.

192
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,465
I thoughtyou'd never call.

193
00:18:15,535 --> 00:18:17,628
I called
as soon as I got to Madrid.

194
00:18:17,704 --> 00:18:19,365
I mean in Argentina.

195
00:18:19,439 --> 00:18:21,703
I called you loads oftimes...

196
00:18:21,775 --> 00:18:24,403
but I must have got
your aunt's numberwrong.

197
00:18:25,178 --> 00:18:28,773
I wasn't in Argentina, Mamen.
I went to Corua.

198
00:18:38,725 --> 00:18:40,852
Why did you go there?

199
00:18:43,597 --> 00:18:46,862
I went after my son's heart.

200
00:18:46,933 --> 00:18:49,902
Who told you?
How did you know?

201
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:51,460
I looked in the files...

202
00:18:51,538 --> 00:18:54,939
until I found the name and address
ofthe transplant recipient.

203
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:57,272
You shouldn't have.

204
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,938
It was wrong,
and the best way to go crazy.

205
00:19:00,013 --> 00:19:02,072
- Look at me, damn it!
- I know that.

206
00:19:02,149 --> 00:19:05,084
The best thing for me
is to quit the NTO and leave Madrid.

207
00:19:05,152 --> 00:19:08,280
- I didn't say that.
- Butyou think it-- and you're right.

208
00:19:09,356 --> 00:19:11,290
I think I won't even unpack.

209
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:15,226
You're in no shape to travel alone.
You're ill.

210
00:19:15,295 --> 00:19:17,855
You have to rest up
and get better.

211
00:19:17,931 --> 00:19:19,694
I'll stay here tonight.

212
00:19:19,766 --> 00:19:23,293
- Then come home with me.
- I want to be alone, Mamen.

213
00:19:23,370 --> 00:19:26,032
- Try to be reasonable.
- How?

214
00:19:35,348 --> 00:19:38,749
Seventeenyears ago,
Imade thissamejourney...

215
00:19:38,819 --> 00:19:42,346
butin the opposite direction,
from Barcelona to Madrid.

216
00:19:43,023 --> 00:19:45,389
I was runningaway then too...

217
00:19:45,459 --> 00:19:47,222
butI wasn'talone.

218
00:19:48,061 --> 00:19:50,552
I was carrying Esteban
insideme.

219
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:54,496
I was runningaway
from his fatherthen...

220
00:19:54,868 --> 00:19:58,804
andnowI'mgoing
insearch ofhim.

221
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,735
- Shall I keep going?
- Yes, go on.

222
00:22:30,323 --> 00:22:31,984
Stop!

223
00:22:35,695 --> 00:22:37,993
Son ofa bitch!

224
00:22:46,373 --> 00:22:49,103
You're crazy, you faggot!

225
00:22:58,351 --> 00:23:00,114
Son ofa bitch!

226
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:13,790
- What did you do?
- I hit him with a stone.

227
00:23:14,334 --> 00:23:16,894
- Help me get him up.
- Get up. Come on.

228
00:23:18,505 --> 00:23:21,235
Come on,Juan. Get up.

229
00:23:21,308 --> 00:23:23,902
Areyou all right?
Stand up.

230
00:23:24,477 --> 00:23:26,877
Let's get moving.

231
00:23:26,947 --> 00:23:29,381
Come on, quickly.

232
00:23:31,184 --> 00:23:34,210
What a fucking useless psychopath!

233
00:23:36,022 --> 00:23:37,717
Look.

234
00:23:40,427 --> 00:23:42,827
See that bonfire
where the ''tops'' are?

235
00:23:42,896 --> 00:23:44,488
Ask for Ursula.

236
00:23:44,564 --> 00:23:47,226
Tell herAgrado sentyou.
She'll fixyou up.

237
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,460
Agrado!

238
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:52,265
It's you!

239
00:23:52,339 --> 00:23:54,273
Manolita!

240
00:23:59,045 --> 00:24:00,512
You're hurt.

241
00:24:00,580 --> 00:24:02,844
No, no, it's your blood.

242
00:24:02,916 --> 00:24:05,714
It isn't becauseyou saved my life,
but how I've missed you!

243
00:24:05,785 --> 00:24:09,084
Eighteen years-- not a word,
not a letter, not a fucking call.

244
00:24:09,155 --> 00:24:11,282
I thoughtyou were dead, bitch!

245
00:24:11,358 --> 00:24:13,087
You can tell me everything
at home.

246
00:24:13,159 --> 00:24:17,425
We'll stop by a drugstore first.
Can we get a taxi here?

247
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:19,021
Over there.

248
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:21,990
With any luck,
we won't get mugged on the way.

249
00:24:22,068 --> 00:24:25,902
- You got the knife?
- Yes, and a rock in my purse.

250
00:24:28,908 --> 00:24:30,739
Hey, there, bonanit.

251
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:35,941
Look, I'm sorry I wokeyou.

252
00:24:36,616 --> 00:24:39,141
- Hey, come over here.
- No. What doyou want?

253
00:24:39,252 --> 00:24:42,710
- We're not going to eatyou.
- What doyou want?

254
00:24:42,822 --> 00:24:44,722
Let me do the talking.

255
00:24:44,791 --> 00:24:48,386
Povidone-iodine,
approximation sutures...

256
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:51,760
Thrombocid,
sterilized gauze and--

257
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:54,857
- You got any alcohol?
- No, I drank it all last night.

258
00:24:54,968 --> 00:24:56,731
I mean for disinfecting.

259
00:24:56,803 --> 00:25:01,206
No. I've got Vaseline, condoms
and lots ofbandages.

260
00:25:01,674 --> 00:25:04,438
- Anything else?
- Alcohol, please.

261
00:25:05,745 --> 00:25:08,976
Oh, Manolita!
The Barceloneta!

262
00:25:09,049 --> 00:25:11,517
Those were the days!
You remember?

263
00:25:12,118 --> 00:25:15,884
Yes.
Please, don't moveyour head.

264
00:25:18,324 --> 00:25:20,258
You know anything
about her?

265
00:25:20,326 --> 00:25:22,351
About who? Lola?

266
00:25:22,429 --> 00:25:25,193
- Unfortunately.
- What happened?

267
00:25:25,265 --> 00:25:27,096
I took her in.
She was in a bad way.

268
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:30,227
As usual,
with all the shit she takes.

269
00:25:30,303 --> 00:25:32,430
I came back from working
the Field all night...

270
00:25:32,505 --> 00:25:34,700
and she'd cleaned the place out.

271
00:25:34,774 --> 00:25:37,902
Watches,jewelry, '70s magazines
that were my inspiration.

272
00:25:37,977 --> 00:25:39,706
300,000 pesetas.

273
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:41,474
What hurt most was...

274
00:25:41,548 --> 00:25:44,745
she took a statue ofthe Virgin
that my mother gave me.

275
00:25:44,818 --> 00:25:47,048
What for?
She doesn't believe in anything!

276
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,147
Unless she's in a satanic sect
and wanted it for some ritual.

277
00:25:51,524 --> 00:25:53,458
I see she hasn't changed.

278
00:25:53,526 --> 00:25:56,154
To do that to me,
with all she owes me!

279
00:25:56,229 --> 00:25:59,630
Since we met in Paris 20 years ago,
I've been like a sister to her.

280
00:25:59,699 --> 00:26:02,668
We got our tits together.
You know better than anyone.

281
00:26:05,538 --> 00:26:09,030
- You never saw her again?
- No, and I don't want to.

282
00:26:09,109 --> 00:26:10,770
Areyou looking for her?

283
00:26:12,011 --> 00:26:13,706
Yes.

284
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:16,946
We've got unsettled business.

285
00:26:19,519 --> 00:26:22,215
Why did you go offlike that?

286
00:26:25,225 --> 00:26:27,125
Won'tyou tell me anything?

287
00:26:29,395 --> 00:26:31,386
I can't.

288
00:26:32,699 --> 00:26:34,223
Some other day.

289
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:36,435
All right.

290
00:26:36,503 --> 00:26:38,232
Just don't disappear again.

291
00:26:39,139 --> 00:26:41,835
I like to say good-bye
to the people I love...

292
00:26:41,908 --> 00:26:44,877
even ifit's only
to cry my eyes out, bitch.

293
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:09,794
I can't believe it.

294
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,070
I look like the Elephant Man!

295
00:27:23,016 --> 00:27:26,076
Don't exaggerate.
It'sjust a bit swollen.

296
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:28,746
A bit swollen?
Where can I go with a mug like this?

297
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,285
Come and eat something.

298
00:27:31,357 --> 00:27:33,882
Why did you go
to all this trouble?

299
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,588
Salad-- how wonderful!

300
00:27:36,896 --> 00:27:39,694
It really hurts to chew!

301
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,256
I won't be able to suck.

302
00:27:41,334 --> 00:27:43,234
You shouldn't work today.

303
00:27:43,303 --> 00:27:44,930
What can I do?

304
00:27:45,004 --> 00:27:46,995
Lola cleaned me out.
I have to work.

305
00:27:47,073 --> 00:27:49,598
Look, caramel spread!
And meat pie!

306
00:27:49,676 --> 00:27:50,973
And myprovoleta .

307
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,705
I have to work too.

308
00:27:52,779 --> 00:27:54,872
Ifyou want,
we can look together.

309
00:27:54,948 --> 00:27:56,540
Oh, yes!

310
00:27:58,218 --> 00:28:00,743
Sinceyou left,
I haven't had a decent meal.

311
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:03,755
Well, also, as a model,
I have to watch my figure.

312
00:28:03,823 --> 00:28:06,690
The worst thing about this work
is you've got to look cute...

313
00:28:06,759 --> 00:28:11,492
and keep up with the latest advances
in surgery and cosmetics.

314
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,538
You look terrific!

315
00:28:19,606 --> 00:28:21,904
Nothing like a Chanel
to makeyou feel respectable.

316
00:28:21,975 --> 00:28:23,272
You look it.

317
00:28:23,977 --> 00:28:26,172
Don't I look a bit ofa slut
in this suit?

318
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,372
All the better.

319
00:28:27,447 --> 00:28:30,746
These nuns only help
whores and transvestites.

320
00:28:31,884 --> 00:28:33,647
Is that a real Chanel?

321
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:38,453
No! How could I buy a real Chanel
with all the hunger in the world!

322
00:28:38,524 --> 00:28:41,015
All I have that's real
are my feelings...

323
00:28:41,094 --> 00:28:43,824
and these pints ofsilicone
that weigh a ton.

324
00:28:43,896 --> 00:28:46,888
I feel so old, Manolita,
and it isn't my age.

325
00:28:46,966 --> 00:28:49,332
It's because ofthe beating.

326
00:28:49,402 --> 00:28:52,667
The beating I've taken
for the last 40 years!

327
00:28:53,973 --> 00:28:56,203
- Hello.
- Come in.

328
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,369
Areyou looking for someone,
or can I help?

329
00:28:58,444 --> 00:29:00,503
We want to see the girl
who goes to the Field.

330
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,309
The cute one.

331
00:29:02,382 --> 00:29:04,509
Sister Rosa. She's inside.
Go on in.

332
00:29:04,584 --> 00:29:06,313
Thankyou.

333
00:29:15,295 --> 00:29:17,388
Rosa, look. Visitors.

334
00:29:23,136 --> 00:29:24,797
What happened toyour face?

335
00:29:24,871 --> 00:29:27,431
Nothing. A beating.
Occupational hazard.

336
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:29,634
- Can we talk?
- Ofcourse.

337
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:32,940
Let's go next door.
It's quieter.

338
00:29:33,012 --> 00:29:35,003
My friend and I want
to quit the street...

339
00:29:35,081 --> 00:29:36,673
but we need to work.

340
00:29:36,749 --> 00:29:39,718
Cleaning stairs, whatever.
We don't care.

341
00:29:39,786 --> 00:29:41,117
There isn't much else.

342
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:44,645
Well, garbage collector,
or learning handicrafts here.

343
00:29:44,724 --> 00:29:47,625
Embroidered tablecloths,
dried flowers.

344
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,992
I think I prefer
garbage collector.

345
00:29:50,697 --> 00:29:52,494
What can you do,
apart from the street?

346
00:29:52,565 --> 00:29:54,499
I've worked as a cook.

347
00:29:54,567 --> 00:29:56,330
She's practically a surgeon.

348
00:29:56,402 --> 00:29:58,302
Look at this face.
She did it.

349
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:00,965
Better than Pitanguy.
She's a compatriot of Lola's.

350
00:30:01,307 --> 00:30:03,969
Really? Haveyou heard
anything about her?

351
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,611
I haven't seen her in 1 8 years.

352
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,613
She cleaned out my place.

353
00:30:08,681 --> 00:30:10,171
She was here.

354
00:30:10,249 --> 00:30:12,581
It must have been
about four months ago.

355
00:30:12,652 --> 00:30:15,086
We helped her through detox.

356
00:30:15,154 --> 00:30:16,985
I cared for her
through withdrawal...

357
00:30:17,056 --> 00:30:19,650
but then shejust disappeared.

358
00:30:19,726 --> 00:30:22,718
I'd like to see her
before I go to El Salvador.

359
00:30:22,795 --> 00:30:24,626
El Salvador?

360
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:26,289
Maybe I'll sign on.

361
00:30:26,366 --> 00:30:29,631
I always thought I could
make it big in the Third World.

362
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,936
Then come with me.
I won't be so alone.

363
00:30:32,004 --> 00:30:34,370
The street's getting worse here
every day.

364
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:38,206
The whores were bad enough,
but the drag queens are wiping us out.

365
00:30:38,277 --> 00:30:40,370
I can't stand the drag queens.
They're sleazebags.

366
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:42,676
They confuse transvestism
with a circus.

367
00:30:42,749 --> 00:30:44,512
Worse, with mime!

368
00:30:44,584 --> 00:30:47,144
A woman is her hair,
her nails...

369
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:49,188
lips for sucking or for bitching.

370
00:30:49,255 --> 00:30:52,088
I mean, haveyou ever seen
a bald woman?

371
00:30:52,158 --> 00:30:54,820
I can't stand them.
They're all sleazebags!

372
00:30:56,429 --> 00:30:58,420
I doubt there are
many drag queens in El Salvador...

373
00:30:58,498 --> 00:30:59,988
but they're
in the middle ofa war.

374
00:31:00,066 --> 00:31:02,432
Yeah? I didn't know that.

375
00:31:03,403 --> 00:31:05,462
I'm replacing some nuns
who were murdered.

376
00:31:05,872 --> 00:31:09,467
I'm not sure
what I need right now is a war.

377
00:31:09,542 --> 00:31:11,840
You're terrible, Agrado.

378
00:31:12,678 --> 00:31:14,646
Soyou were a cook.

379
00:31:14,714 --> 00:31:15,772
Yes.

380
00:31:15,848 --> 00:31:17,577
Who? This one?

381
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:19,277
The best!

382
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:45,001
What a surprise!

383
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:46,567
Hi, Mom.

384
00:31:46,646 --> 00:31:48,045
Are we interrupting?

385
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:50,378
It doesn't matter.
We seeyou so rarely.

386
00:31:53,419 --> 00:31:55,751
- This is Manuela.
- Pleased to meetyou.

387
00:31:55,822 --> 00:31:58,222
Come inside.
Don'tjust stand there.

388
00:32:00,226 --> 00:32:01,853
Mom, Manuela is a cook...

389
00:32:01,928 --> 00:32:04,328
and as Florinda's gone,
I thought--

390
00:32:04,397 --> 00:32:07,366
Thankyou, darling.
Vicenta and I can manage.

391
00:32:07,433 --> 00:32:10,402
But how?
Dad alone needs two people.

392
00:32:10,470 --> 00:32:12,938
- Where is he?
- Out with the dog.

393
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,472
- On their own?
- Ofcourse.

394
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:15,837
What ifthey get lost?

395
00:32:15,908 --> 00:32:18,376
The dog knows the way home.
Don't worry.

396
00:32:18,444 --> 00:32:20,912
What a shame!
I reallywanted to see them.

397
00:32:20,980 --> 00:32:23,642
We'll go look for them,
but first we have to talk.

398
00:32:23,716 --> 00:32:24,808
Come into the studio.

399
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:27,284
I'm sorryyou came for nothing.

400
00:32:27,353 --> 00:32:29,548
- It's all right.
- Try her for a few days.

401
00:32:29,622 --> 00:32:32,113
Think of Dad.
Manuela's a nurse.

402
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,522
- As well as a cook?
- Yes.

403
00:32:33,593 --> 00:32:36,357
I prefer to look
afteryour father myself.

404
00:32:36,429 --> 00:32:39,887
I understand.
Thankyou anyway. I'll go.

405
00:32:39,966 --> 00:32:40,864
Good-bye.

406
00:32:40,933 --> 00:32:42,594
- Manuela.
- Yes?

407
00:32:42,668 --> 00:32:45,034
Wait here.
I won't be long.

408
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,741
How dareyou bring
a whore here!

409
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:53,802
It isn't easy to find help
who'll put up with you.

410
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,279
But a whore!

411
00:32:55,348 --> 00:32:57,441
That's no reason
to be so rude.

412
00:32:57,517 --> 00:33:00,782
I don't like strangers
to see me forging Chagalls.

413
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,480
Can'tyou understand?

414
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:05,547
Manuela isn't a whore anymore.
She's given it up.

415
00:33:05,625 --> 00:33:07,115
How long haveyou known her?

416
00:33:07,593 --> 00:33:08,890
Since this morning.

417
00:33:09,328 --> 00:33:13,230
This morning?
You're incredible.

418
00:33:13,299 --> 00:33:15,062
Mywork is to help people...

419
00:33:15,134 --> 00:33:16,863
even ifI'vejust met them.

420
00:33:16,936 --> 00:33:18,870
Well, mine isn't.

421
00:33:18,938 --> 00:33:21,736
Don't look at me like that.
It doesn't mean I'm intolerant.

422
00:33:22,942 --> 00:33:25,911
- I'll makeyou a deal.
- A deal?

423
00:33:25,978 --> 00:33:30,176
I'll give that woman a chance
ifyou don't go to El Salvador.

424
00:33:30,249 --> 00:33:32,945
Mom, don't give me any more doubts.
I've got enough.

425
00:33:33,019 --> 00:33:35,579
And soyou should.
That trip is suicide!

426
00:33:35,655 --> 00:33:37,748
No, it's parricide!

427
00:33:37,823 --> 00:33:40,087
Well, I have to go.

428
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:41,683
Manuela's waiting.

429
00:33:41,761 --> 00:33:45,162
Sure! Anywhore, any Salvadoran,
is more important than your parents!

430
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:48,928
- Don't start, Mom.
- You should go see a psychiatrist.

431
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:53,164
It wouldn't do
either ofus any harm.

432
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:57,002
Didn'tyou want to see
your father and the dog?

433
00:33:57,076 --> 00:33:58,941
Another day.

434
00:33:59,011 --> 00:34:00,876
Areyou all right?

435
00:34:02,615 --> 00:34:05,106
Good-bye, Mom.

436
00:34:14,961 --> 00:34:17,521
- Hello, Vicenta.
- Rosa, love.

437
00:34:17,597 --> 00:34:20,157
- You're so thin. Aren'tyou eating?
- Yes, I am.

438
00:34:20,232 --> 00:34:22,757
- Did you see a blonde girl downstairs?
- No.

439
00:34:23,803 --> 00:34:26,169
- So long.
- Take care-- and eat!

440
00:34:38,551 --> 00:34:40,382
A STREETCAR NAMEDDESIRE

441
00:34:43,723 --> 00:34:46,351
I'm sorry about my mother.

442
00:34:46,425 --> 00:34:48,689
I'm sorry.

443
00:34:50,296 --> 00:34:51,263
Shall we go?

444
00:34:51,831 --> 00:34:54,732
I can't deal with my mother.
She drives me crazy.

445
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:58,426
- Haveyou got parents?
- They're dead.

446
00:34:58,504 --> 00:35:00,665
Soyou're alone.

447
00:35:00,740 --> 00:35:02,605
I guess so.

448
00:35:02,675 --> 00:35:04,370
You look awful.

449
00:35:04,443 --> 00:35:07,241
I don't feel verywell.

450
00:35:07,313 --> 00:35:09,941
I want to throw up.

451
00:35:11,984 --> 00:35:13,645
I've got--

452
00:35:17,523 --> 00:35:19,252
Here.

453
00:35:19,325 --> 00:35:21,350
Haveyou seen the doctor?

454
00:35:22,828 --> 00:35:26,229
You should.
It mayjust be gastritis.

455
00:35:28,801 --> 00:35:31,861
Can we go toyour place
until this passes?

456
00:35:31,971 --> 00:35:33,336
Well--

457
00:35:33,406 --> 00:35:35,033
Doyou have a place?

458
00:35:35,107 --> 00:35:39,237
I'vejust rented one,
but it's barely furnished.

459
00:35:42,948 --> 00:35:45,576
It's quite a mess.

460
00:35:46,252 --> 00:35:48,743
I moved in four days ago.

461
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,716
You want to lie down
for a while?

462
00:35:50,790 --> 00:35:53,520
No, I'll just sit here on the sofa...

463
00:35:53,592 --> 00:35:54,752
until it passes.

464
00:35:54,827 --> 00:35:56,692
I'm going to take this off.

465
00:35:58,931 --> 00:36:01,456
Who's this handsome boy?

466
00:36:03,369 --> 00:36:05,200
My son.

467
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:10,205
I thoughtyou were alone.

468
00:36:10,276 --> 00:36:12,767
He died in an accident.

469
00:36:13,446 --> 00:36:16,040
Oh, I'm sorry!

470
00:36:19,251 --> 00:36:22,015
Don't touch the notebook,
please.

471
00:36:58,824 --> 00:37:00,724
Come on, baby.
The worst is over.

472
00:37:00,793 --> 00:37:04,024
Don't touch me!
Don't ever touch me again, bastard!

473
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,087
Watch your language!

474
00:37:12,605 --> 00:37:14,402
Stella, come here.

475
00:37:14,473 --> 00:37:16,771
I'm never coming back
to this house.

476
00:37:16,842 --> 00:37:19,140
Never!

477
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:49,307
DRESSI NG ROOMS

478
00:38:02,388 --> 00:38:04,379
Come in, Nina.

479
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:07,449
I'm not Nina.
I'm Manuela.

480
00:38:10,896 --> 00:38:13,057
You shouldn't be here.

481
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:14,895
Nina's gone.

482
00:38:14,967 --> 00:38:16,400
What?

483
00:38:23,442 --> 00:38:25,103
Where's Nina?

484
00:38:25,177 --> 00:38:28,112
I don't know.
I just saw her run out.

485
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:34,983
She said she'd wait for me
in her dressing room!

486
00:38:35,955 --> 00:38:38,389
I can't believe it.

487
00:38:42,328 --> 00:38:44,489
It's only been two weeks.

488
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:46,997
She can't do this to me.

489
00:38:52,838 --> 00:38:54,601
Haveyou got a car?

490
00:38:54,673 --> 00:38:56,436
No. Where doyou want to go?

491
00:38:58,010 --> 00:39:00,103
I don't know.

492
00:39:01,046 --> 00:39:02,274
Can you drive?

493
00:39:02,348 --> 00:39:03,576
Yes.

494
00:39:07,353 --> 00:39:10,345
Don't tell anyone,
but Nina's got problems withjunk.

495
00:39:11,724 --> 00:39:15,057
Doyou know where she'd go
to score at this time?

496
00:39:15,127 --> 00:39:17,391
No, but it's easy to find out.

497
00:39:17,463 --> 00:39:18,987
Thankyou.

498
00:39:19,064 --> 00:39:20,588
Whoeveryou are...

499
00:39:20,666 --> 00:39:23,692
I have always depended
on the kindness ofstrangers.

500
00:39:25,704 --> 00:39:27,968
I can't drive.

501
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,803
Nina does the driving.

502
00:39:29,875 --> 00:39:31,934
- Want one?
- No, thankyou.

503
00:39:36,348 --> 00:39:39,181
I started smoking
because of Bette Davis.

504
00:39:39,251 --> 00:39:41,185
To imitate her.

505
00:39:41,253 --> 00:39:44,347
At 1 8, I was smoking
like a chimney.

506
00:39:44,823 --> 00:39:46,882
That's why
I called myself Huma.

507
00:39:46,959 --> 00:39:49,257
Huma's a very pretty name.

508
00:39:50,696 --> 00:39:52,960
Smoke is all there's been
in my life.

509
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:55,432
You've had success too.

510
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:58,095
Success has got no taste
or smell.

511
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,367
And when you get used to it,
it's as ifit didn't exist.

512
00:40:02,374 --> 00:40:05,468
God, where has that girl gone?

513
00:40:36,208 --> 00:40:37,869
I think that's her!

514
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:43,304
You stay here. I'll go.

515
00:40:53,158 --> 00:40:56,127
He's a son ofa bitch.
He rips everybody off.

516
00:40:56,195 --> 00:40:58,663
Yeah, and since I'm not
from here--

517
00:40:58,731 --> 00:41:00,562
Don't touch me.

518
00:41:00,632 --> 00:41:02,600
Listen, Nina.

519
00:41:02,668 --> 00:41:05,068
Huma's waiting foryou.

520
00:41:05,137 --> 00:41:07,264
Who the fuck areyou?

521
00:41:07,339 --> 00:41:08,772
She's in the car.

522
00:41:25,157 --> 00:41:26,647
I got everything.

523
00:41:28,394 --> 00:41:31,158
- Fuck, my purse!
- Yeah, I got a purse.

524
00:41:31,230 --> 00:41:34,393
Ecstasy, toot.

525
00:41:58,724 --> 00:42:01,056
- Who is it?
- It's Rosa.

526
00:42:02,428 --> 00:42:04,089
- Hello.
- How areyou?

527
00:42:04,163 --> 00:42:07,030
- Areyou alone?
- I just got up.

528
00:42:07,099 --> 00:42:08,430
This late?

529
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,230
I was out late last night.

530
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:13,732
- Some breakfast?
- No, thanks.

531
00:42:13,806 --> 00:42:17,003
- Aren'tyou hungry?
- Soyou're back on the street.

532
00:42:17,076 --> 00:42:20,239
Just when I'd found
anotherway foryou to earn money.

533
00:42:20,312 --> 00:42:22,109
Tell me.
I'm not a whore.

534
00:42:22,181 --> 00:42:25,082
I've been fucked around a lot,
but I'm not a whore.

535
00:42:25,150 --> 00:42:26,913
Why did you lie to me?

536
00:42:26,985 --> 00:42:30,079
It was Agrado's idea.
The dress was hers too.

537
00:42:30,155 --> 00:42:34,353
So tell me: What's this otherway
for me to earn money?

538
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:36,917
I'm dying ofcuriosity.

539
00:42:36,995 --> 00:42:39,520
How much would you charge
to rent me a room?

540
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:41,862
To rentyou a room?
Why?

541
00:42:41,934 --> 00:42:44,528
I'm going to leave the center
for a few months.

542
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:47,197
What about El Salvador?

543
00:42:47,272 --> 00:42:49,797
I don't feel well.

544
00:42:49,875 --> 00:42:52,002
I can't travel like this.

545
00:42:52,077 --> 00:42:55,979
Why doyou want to move in here
ifyou're ill?

546
00:42:58,617 --> 00:43:01,245
I'm pregnant.

547
00:43:02,254 --> 00:43:04,381
Pregnant?

548
00:43:04,456 --> 00:43:06,219
What areyou going to do?

549
00:43:06,291 --> 00:43:09,055
Have it, ofcourse.
What doyou expect?

550
00:43:09,128 --> 00:43:11,528
I thought it'd be
less ofa scandal here.

551
00:43:11,597 --> 00:43:13,724
Can't the father
helpyou out?

552
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:16,324
The father!
God knows where he is.

553
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:18,733
Butyou know who he is,
don'tyou?

554
00:43:18,804 --> 00:43:21,602
Ofcourse.
Who doyou take me for?

555
00:43:21,673 --> 00:43:23,402
I'm sorry.

556
00:43:23,842 --> 00:43:26,106
It was your compatriot Lola.

557
00:43:30,516 --> 00:43:32,882
That lousy, fucking bitch!

558
00:43:35,254 --> 00:43:37,586
What's come overyou?

559
00:43:39,224 --> 00:43:41,624
What's come over me?

560
00:43:41,793 --> 00:43:43,454
How far along areyou?

561
00:43:44,496 --> 00:43:46,987
Three months, I think.

562
00:43:47,065 --> 00:43:48,589
But I'm veryworried.

563
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:50,658
Worried?
I'm not surprised!

564
00:43:52,771 --> 00:43:54,534
I had bleeding this morning.

565
00:43:54,606 --> 00:43:55,766
Haveyou seen a doctor?

566
00:43:58,510 --> 00:44:01,240
I'm going
to the Hospital del Mar tomorrow.

567
00:44:01,313 --> 00:44:03,440
I wanted to know
ifyou'd come with me.

568
00:44:04,082 --> 00:44:05,606
Yes, ofcourse.

569
00:44:05,684 --> 00:44:07,811
Thankyou.

570
00:44:09,221 --> 00:44:11,280
What about the room?

571
00:44:12,257 --> 00:44:14,122
I'm sorry.

572
00:44:14,193 --> 00:44:16,753
You can't stay here.

573
00:44:37,382 --> 00:44:39,077
Good evening.
May I come in?

574
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:41,381
Hello!
I was expecting you.

575
00:44:41,453 --> 00:44:43,421
I didn't know
where to send your purse.

576
00:44:43,488 --> 00:44:44,978
Here it is.

577
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,786
Thankyou.

578
00:44:50,696 --> 00:44:52,095
Is everything there?

579
00:44:52,164 --> 00:44:54,758
Yes, everything.

580
00:44:54,833 --> 00:44:56,630
- Thankyou for last night.
- Not at all.

581
00:44:56,702 --> 00:44:59,136
I'd love to talk more,
but I'm short on time.

582
00:44:59,204 --> 00:45:01,365
- Can I helpyou?
- Could you button this?

583
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,873
Ofcourse.

584
00:45:02,941 --> 00:45:04,772
What was your name?

585
00:45:06,545 --> 00:45:08,479
Would you like
to work for me?

586
00:45:08,547 --> 00:45:11,710
- Doing what?
- Everything.

587
00:45:11,783 --> 00:45:15,219
Everything except sleep with me.
I've got enough with Nina.

588
00:45:15,287 --> 00:45:18,381
Well, the truth is
I was looking for ajob.

589
00:45:18,457 --> 00:45:22,325
I need a personal assistant.
Someone I can trust.

590
00:45:22,394 --> 00:45:26,125
- You don't know me.
- What I saw last night was enough.

591
00:45:26,198 --> 00:45:28,063
But Nina hates me.

592
00:45:28,133 --> 00:45:31,296
Nina hates everyone,
including herselfand me.

593
00:45:31,370 --> 00:45:33,133
Well...

594
00:45:34,506 --> 00:45:36,235
when do I start?

595
00:45:36,308 --> 00:45:38,868
- Right now, ifyou can.
- All right.

596
00:45:41,213 --> 00:45:43,340
Ask Nina what she wants
for dinner.

597
00:45:43,415 --> 00:45:46,145
- I'll just have an esqueixada.
- Anything else?

598
00:45:46,218 --> 00:45:49,984
Could you get a tranquilizer for Nina?
She's real edgy today.

599
00:45:50,055 --> 00:45:53,684
- I've got Lexatin.
- Terrific!

600
00:46:17,616 --> 00:46:19,811
Don't mention the father.

601
00:46:19,885 --> 00:46:22,319
Why doyou dislike Lola so much?

602
00:46:22,387 --> 00:46:24,321
Lola's got the worst ofa man...

603
00:46:24,389 --> 00:46:26,289
and the worst ofa woman.

604
00:46:27,693 --> 00:46:29,558
I'll tell you a story.

605
00:46:30,896 --> 00:46:34,059
I had a friend
who got married veryyoung.

606
00:46:34,132 --> 00:46:36,327
After a year, her husband
went to work in Paris...

607
00:46:36,401 --> 00:46:39,268
and he was to call her
when he got settled.

608
00:46:39,471 --> 00:46:41,132
Twoyears passed.

609
00:46:41,206 --> 00:46:45,006
The husband saved some money
and came to Barcelona to open a bar.

610
00:46:45,344 --> 00:46:47,812
She came here tojoin him.

611
00:46:47,879 --> 00:46:50,245
Twoyears isn't a long time...

612
00:46:51,049 --> 00:46:53,540
but the husband had changed.

613
00:46:53,618 --> 00:46:55,950
He didn't love her anymore.

614
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,512
The change was more physical.

615
00:46:58,590 --> 00:47:01,684
He'd gotten a pair oftits
that were bigger than hers.

616
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:03,990
Oh, I see.

617
00:47:05,497 --> 00:47:08,295
My friend was veryyoung.

618
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:10,998
She was in a foreign land.

619
00:47:11,069 --> 00:47:13,663
She had no one.

620
00:47:14,639 --> 00:47:17,665
Apart from the tits,
the husband hadn't changed that much...

621
00:47:17,743 --> 00:47:21,338
so she ended up accepting him.

622
00:47:23,215 --> 00:47:27,413
Women will do anything
to avoid being alone.

623
00:47:27,486 --> 00:47:30,819
Women are more tolerant,
but that's good.

624
00:47:30,889 --> 00:47:33,050
We're assholes...

625
00:47:33,125 --> 00:47:34,820
and a bit lesbo.

626
00:47:36,161 --> 00:47:38,129
Listen to the end
ofthe story.

627
00:47:38,697 --> 00:47:41,222
My friend
and her husband with the tits...

628
00:47:41,299 --> 00:47:44,496
set up a bar here,
on the Barceloneta.

629
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:49,467
He spent the day in a tiny bikini,
screwing everything he could...

630
00:47:49,541 --> 00:47:51,509
and giving her a hard time
ifshe wore a bikini...

631
00:47:51,576 --> 00:47:54,101
or even a miniskirt.

632
00:47:54,179 --> 00:47:55,874
The bastard!

633
00:47:55,947 --> 00:47:59,542
How could someone act so macho
with a pair oftits like that?

634
00:48:06,558 --> 00:48:08,549
Sit down.

635
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:11,118
- Who is the patient?
- She is.

636
00:48:11,196 --> 00:48:12,493
Well?

637
00:48:14,900 --> 00:48:16,561
My sister is pregnant.

638
00:48:16,635 --> 00:48:19,798
We reckon she's about
three months along.

639
00:48:19,871 --> 00:48:22,499
This is her first checkup.

640
00:48:23,008 --> 00:48:24,999
Yesterday and today
I bled a little.

641
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:29,603
Lie down on the couch,
and strip from the waist down.

642
00:48:30,348 --> 00:48:32,475
Don't worry.

643
00:48:35,954 --> 00:48:38,218
- Put this on.
- Thankyou.

644
00:48:40,525 --> 00:48:43,824
According to the ultrasound,
the fetus seems to be fine.

645
00:48:43,895 --> 00:48:45,556
Doyou live together?

646
00:48:45,630 --> 00:48:46,995
- No.
- Yes.

647
00:48:47,065 --> 00:48:48,692
Which is it?

648
00:48:48,767 --> 00:48:52,669
She lives with our mother,
but she hasn't told her anything yet.

649
00:48:52,737 --> 00:48:54,500
Is your blood pressure
usually high?

650
00:48:54,573 --> 00:48:56,370
Yes, I have hypertension.

651
00:48:57,809 --> 00:49:00,642
There's a risk ofmiscarriage.

652
00:49:01,513 --> 00:49:03,606
You must move
as little as possible.

653
00:49:05,217 --> 00:49:07,344
But I've got to do myjob.

654
00:49:07,419 --> 00:49:12,254
Your onlyjob now is to rest
and not do anything stupid.

655
00:49:12,958 --> 00:49:15,449
Tell your mother
to watch her blood pressure.

656
00:49:15,527 --> 00:49:18,792
She has to follow a salt-free diet
and rest.

657
00:49:18,864 --> 00:49:20,889
I'll tell her.

658
00:49:20,966 --> 00:49:24,834
Listen, Doctor, I work
with people who are high-risk...

659
00:49:24,903 --> 00:49:28,669
so I'd like to have
an AI DS test as well.

660
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,664
What's yourjob?

661
00:49:31,209 --> 00:49:33,404
She's a social worker.

662
00:49:33,478 --> 00:49:35,708
When can we pick up
the results?

663
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,248
In two weeks' time.

664
00:49:39,417 --> 00:49:41,647
You have to tell your mother.

665
00:49:41,720 --> 00:49:44,280
You need to be looked after.

666
00:49:44,356 --> 00:49:47,621
I found ajobyesterday,
and I'm going to be busy all day.

667
00:49:47,692 --> 00:49:49,683
Listen.

668
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:52,286
You've no right
to ask me to beyour mother.

669
00:49:52,364 --> 00:49:54,389
You've already got one,
even ifyou don't like her.

670
00:49:54,466 --> 00:49:57,458
We can't choose our parents.
They are who they are.

671
00:49:59,604 --> 00:50:01,265
Oh, God!

672
00:50:02,974 --> 00:50:06,137
Please, don't blackmail me!

673
00:50:11,516 --> 00:50:14,144
Idon'tknowifI was right
to call the clinic.

674
00:50:15,153 --> 00:50:17,587
Whatelse couldyoudo?

675
00:50:17,656 --> 00:50:20,147
Ican'tbelieveher
andgo onliving withStanley.

676
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,683
Then don't believe her.
What matters is you and your baby.

677
00:50:23,762 --> 00:50:25,491
What ifshe told me
the truth?

678
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:26,895
Blanche?

679
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,365
Blanche is in no shape
to tell the truth...

680
00:50:29,434 --> 00:50:32,198
even ifshe wanted to,
poor thing.

681
00:50:34,739 --> 00:50:36,730
Where is my heart?

682
00:50:36,808 --> 00:50:39,470
She means herjewel box.
It's heart-shaped.

683
00:50:39,544 --> 00:50:42,570
I think it's here somewhere.
Look, here it is.

684
00:50:44,382 --> 00:50:47,977
- I need a necklace.
- We'll look for it.

685
00:50:50,488 --> 00:50:52,683
What's the gentleman's name?

686
00:50:52,757 --> 00:50:54,554
Huntleigh.

687
00:50:54,626 --> 00:50:56,685
Did he call
while I was in the bathroom?

688
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:59,924
- No.
- How strange!

689
00:51:02,867 --> 00:51:06,200
Why areyou looking at me like that?
Do I look awful?

690
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:09,638
No, you look better than ever.

691
00:51:11,476 --> 00:51:14,377
- I'll look betterwith this necklace.
- Shall I helpyou?

692
00:51:17,349 --> 00:51:19,408
Soyou'regoingona trip.

693
00:51:19,484 --> 00:51:22,817
You'resolucky.
I'm green with envy.

694
00:51:25,056 --> 00:51:26,546
Thereheis.

695
00:51:26,625 --> 00:51:29,685
Thatmustbe thegentleman
who's come foryou.

696
00:51:36,668 --> 00:51:40,570
TWO WEEKS LATER

697
00:51:47,012 --> 00:51:50,038
- Second call. Fifteen minutes.
- Come in.

698
00:51:51,683 --> 00:51:53,776
- Aren't they hereyet?
- I don't where they are.

699
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:56,650
I was at the TV studio all day.

700
00:51:57,889 --> 00:51:59,447
- Where's Nina?
- Wasn't she with you?

701
00:51:59,524 --> 00:52:01,355
I just left her at home, in bed.

702
00:52:01,426 --> 00:52:03,291
- In bed?
- What's wrong?

703
00:52:03,361 --> 00:52:06,125
I think it's food poisoning.
She was so ill this morning.

704
00:52:06,197 --> 00:52:08,631
Why didn'tyou tell me
when I called?

705
00:52:08,700 --> 00:52:10,725
We didn't want to upsetyou.

706
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:12,702
- Has a doctor seen her?
- Yes.

707
00:52:12,771 --> 00:52:16,935
She's got gastroenteritis,
but she'll be fine tomorrow.

708
00:52:17,008 --> 00:52:18,202
So we cancel the show?

709
00:52:18,276 --> 00:52:21,245
I'd like to speak to Huma,
please.

710
00:52:21,312 --> 00:52:22,370
Yes, wait outside.

711
00:52:23,214 --> 00:52:24,374
Five minutes.

712
00:52:24,482 --> 00:52:26,074
All right!

713
00:52:27,652 --> 00:52:31,144
- Tell me the truth.
- She's bombed. She can't even speak.

714
00:52:31,222 --> 00:52:34,851
She went out afteryou did.
She didn't know I'd drop by.

715
00:52:34,926 --> 00:52:37,190
She thought I'd be with you.

716
00:52:38,296 --> 00:52:40,230
What do we do now?

717
00:52:43,134 --> 00:52:46,297
Ifit won't giveyou a heart attack,
I could do her part.

718
00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:50,033
I know it by heart
from hearing it over the loudspeakers.

719
00:52:50,642 --> 00:52:52,371
But can you act?

720
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:56,406
I can lie verywell,
and I'm used to improvising.

721
00:52:56,481 --> 00:52:57,812
I've seen that.

722
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:01,110
My son said
I was a very good actress.

723
00:53:02,020 --> 00:53:05,285
I didn't even know
you had a son!

724
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:09,283
Third call. Five minutes.

725
00:53:09,360 --> 00:53:11,954
Huma, what'll we do?
We can't wait any longer.

726
00:53:18,603 --> 00:53:20,730
Happy birthday, Blanche.

727
00:53:20,805 --> 00:53:22,568
This is your present.

728
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,768
Thankyou, Stanley.
Why did you bother?

729
00:53:25,844 --> 00:53:27,937
I hopeyou like it.

730
00:53:28,813 --> 00:53:30,303
Why, it's--

731
00:53:30,381 --> 00:53:32,349
A bus ticket.

732
00:53:32,417 --> 00:53:34,317
A return ticket forTuesday.

733
00:53:35,754 --> 00:53:37,881
Areyou insinuating
I should leave?

734
00:53:37,956 --> 00:53:39,924
What doyou think?

735
00:53:46,431 --> 00:53:49,923
- Why did you do that to her?
- I'm sick ofher insults.

736
00:53:50,001 --> 00:53:53,767
I'm tired ofyou two whispering
behind my back all the time!

737
00:53:53,972 --> 00:53:55,701
Please, don't go!

738
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:58,299
- Let go. You've torn my shirt!
- Brute!

739
00:53:58,376 --> 00:54:01,072
Brute?
I was a brute when we met.

740
00:54:01,146 --> 00:54:04,411
But I'd remind you
that it was never a problem foryou.

741
00:54:04,482 --> 00:54:06,814
One dayyou showed me
a picture ofyour house...

742
00:54:06,885 --> 00:54:09,251
a mansion with lots ofcolumns.

743
00:54:09,320 --> 00:54:12,619
I pulled you down offthose columns
and taughtyou to be happy.

744
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:15,488
We laughed
and were happy together...

745
00:54:15,560 --> 00:54:18,723
until your sister Blanche
appeared.

746
00:54:18,797 --> 00:54:20,822
What's wrong?

747
00:54:21,966 --> 00:54:24,799
Take me to the hospital, please!

748
00:54:54,899 --> 00:54:58,300
Congratulations on last night.
I heard you were great.

749
00:54:58,369 --> 00:55:00,929
You can't imagine.
What a pityyou weren't there.

750
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,373
I felt awful.
Agrado called to tell me about it.

751
00:55:05,443 --> 00:55:07,673
She must have called
halfof Barcelona!

752
00:55:07,745 --> 00:55:10,976
Areyou doing everything
the doctor told you?

753
00:55:11,916 --> 00:55:14,476
- I just saw him.
- And?

754
00:55:15,320 --> 00:55:18,653
- I went for my results.
- I forgot it was today.

755
00:55:28,833 --> 00:55:30,391
I'm HIV positive.

756
00:55:31,836 --> 00:55:33,497
We'll have the tests redone.

757
00:55:36,407 --> 00:55:38,932
Why the hell
did you screw Lola?

758
00:55:39,510 --> 00:55:42,502
Don'tyou know
she's been shooting up for 1 5 years?

759
00:55:42,814 --> 00:55:46,181
What world doyou think
you're living in?

760
00:55:53,057 --> 00:55:54,456
I don't know.

761
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,324
Haveyou spoken
toyour mother?

762
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:05,630
Your colleagues?

763
00:56:07,572 --> 00:56:09,802
No.

764
00:56:32,063 --> 00:56:35,829
We'll go foryour things now,
and you'll move in here.

765
00:56:38,036 --> 00:56:40,436
Thankyou.

766
00:56:51,950 --> 00:56:53,178
- Hello.
- Hello, Alex.

767
00:56:53,251 --> 00:56:56,084
You were terrific last night.

768
00:56:56,154 --> 00:56:58,019
Thankyou.

769
00:57:00,325 --> 00:57:03,453
- Good evening.
- Here's Miss GoodyTwo-shoes.

770
00:57:03,528 --> 00:57:05,792
- What's up?
- What's up?

771
00:57:05,863 --> 00:57:07,524
You planned it all, you bitch!

772
00:57:07,598 --> 00:57:09,293
Nina, don't be so rude.

773
00:57:09,367 --> 00:57:12,894
Just like Eve Harrington.
You learned the part on purpose.

774
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,963
It's fucking impossible to learn it
over the loudspeakers.

775
00:57:16,040 --> 00:57:17,905
You think I'm stupid?

776
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,570
The loudspeakers helped me
remember it.

777
00:57:20,645 --> 00:57:22,670
I've known the part ofStella
foryears.

778
00:57:23,014 --> 00:57:26,211
- Really? What a coincidence!
- Ifyou only knew.

779
00:57:26,284 --> 00:57:27,649
What did I tell you?

780
00:57:27,719 --> 00:57:29,710
Whywereyou here
that first night?

781
00:57:29,787 --> 00:57:31,721
Orwas that
a coincidence too?

782
00:57:32,223 --> 00:57:33,815
No, it wasn't a coincidence.

783
00:57:37,996 --> 00:57:41,796
I won't botheryou anymore.
I'll get my things and go.

784
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:46,500
Manuela, I thinkyou owe us
an explanation.

785
00:57:57,081 --> 00:57:59,549
A StreetcarNamedDesire
has marked my life.

786
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:06,354
Twentyyears ago, I played Stella
with an amateur group.

787
00:58:07,358 --> 00:58:09,690
That's where I met
my husband.

788
00:58:10,762 --> 00:58:13,788
He was playing Kowalski.

789
00:58:14,966 --> 00:58:18,458
Two months ago,
I sawyourversion in Madrid.

790
00:58:21,539 --> 00:58:24,133
I went with my son.

791
00:58:25,476 --> 00:58:28,639
It was the night
ofhis birthday.

792
00:58:29,313 --> 00:58:31,611
It was pouring rain,
but we waited outside...

793
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:34,048
because he wanted
your autograph, Huma.

794
00:58:44,095 --> 00:58:46,256
It was crazy
to wait in the rain...

795
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:49,925
but it was his birthday,
so I couldn't say no.

796
00:58:51,936 --> 00:58:55,702
You two got in a taxi,
and he ran afteryou.

797
00:58:58,576 --> 00:59:01,943
A car coming along the street
ran him down.

798
00:59:03,281 --> 00:59:05,841
He was killed.

799
00:59:05,950 --> 00:59:08,214
That's the explanation.

800
00:59:08,286 --> 00:59:10,982
That's the explanation, Huma.

801
00:59:27,672 --> 00:59:30,197
Move, Rosa.
I can't get past.

802
00:59:30,274 --> 00:59:32,242
What areyou doing here?

803
00:59:32,310 --> 00:59:34,938
Hello. I came to payyou.

804
00:59:35,012 --> 00:59:36,843
You leftyesterday
withoutyour money.

805
00:59:37,582 --> 00:59:39,106
This is my sister Rosa.

806
00:59:39,183 --> 00:59:41,083
- Hello.
- How areyou?

807
00:59:41,152 --> 00:59:42,949
Let me helpyou.

808
00:59:43,588 --> 00:59:45,522
Let's get the elevator.

809
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:50,254
- Where's Nina?
- I left herwith Mario. She says hi.

810
00:59:53,097 --> 00:59:55,224
Leave the bags here.

811
00:59:58,236 --> 01:00:00,227
You go and rest for a while,
Rosa.

812
01:00:00,304 --> 01:00:02,670
- I'm not tired.
- Don't argue.

813
01:00:02,940 --> 01:00:05,033
Sit down.

814
01:00:06,210 --> 01:00:09,668
- Anything to drink?
- No, thankyou.

815
01:00:10,581 --> 01:00:12,879
She's like a little girl.

816
01:00:16,888 --> 01:00:19,789
I couldn't sleep all night
thinking aboutyour son.

817
01:00:19,857 --> 01:00:22,792
I can remember his face
in the rain perfectly...

818
01:00:23,194 --> 01:00:25,025
and the notebook
in his hand.

819
01:00:26,030 --> 01:00:27,657
I can see him now.

820
01:00:28,900 --> 01:00:31,198
I don't want to talk
about my son.

821
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:33,197
I can't.

822
01:00:37,241 --> 01:00:40,574
Apart from apologizing,
Nina and and I wantyou to come back.

823
01:00:41,479 --> 01:00:43,709
Rosa's sick.

824
01:00:43,781 --> 01:00:45,942
She needs someone
to look after her all day.

825
01:00:46,017 --> 01:00:49,475
I can't leave her.
I'm sorry.

826
01:00:49,554 --> 01:00:51,818
I don't know what I should do.

827
01:00:52,790 --> 01:00:55,486
Why don'tyou check Nina
into a clinic?

828
01:01:01,432 --> 01:01:04,492
Ifwe don't fulfill the contract,
the companywill sue me.

829
01:01:05,102 --> 01:01:07,093
Find a replacement...

830
01:01:07,171 --> 01:01:09,162
and finish your run
with the company.

831
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:12,302
I can't do the play
without Nina.

832
01:01:13,544 --> 01:01:16,570
She's hooked onjunk,
but I'm hooked on her.

833
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:30,189
- Who was it?
- Agrado.

834
01:01:30,261 --> 01:01:32,058
And you let her in?

835
01:01:33,231 --> 01:01:35,028
You should have said
we were busy.

836
01:01:35,099 --> 01:01:36,760
I'm thinking ofyou.

837
01:01:36,834 --> 01:01:40,031
Come on, lie down here
and stop moving around.

838
01:01:40,104 --> 01:01:41,799
What exactly
is wrong with you?

839
01:01:41,872 --> 01:01:43,601
An accident.

840
01:01:44,675 --> 01:01:46,233
What kind?

841
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,973
Why didn't I think ofit before?
Agrado could take my place.

842
01:01:50,047 --> 01:01:51,036
Ofcourse!

843
01:01:51,115 --> 01:01:53,083
The oneyou didn't want
to let in?

844
01:01:54,085 --> 01:01:56,952
That's something between us,
but she's perfect foryou.

845
01:02:01,993 --> 01:02:03,824
How old is Agrado?

846
01:02:03,894 --> 01:02:07,022
Pretty old.
Between thirty and fifty.

847
01:02:07,098 --> 01:02:08,622
Is Agrado her real name?

848
01:02:08,699 --> 01:02:11,429
No, it's a stage name.
Like Huma.

849
01:02:13,170 --> 01:02:15,001
You know why
I took the name Huma?

850
01:02:15,072 --> 01:02:16,505
Yes.

851
01:02:16,574 --> 01:02:18,064
Manuela told me.

852
01:02:19,143 --> 01:02:20,974
What else did she tell you?

853
01:02:21,045 --> 01:02:23,275
Everything.
She told me everything.

854
01:02:23,347 --> 01:02:25,144
Aboutyou and Nina...

855
01:02:25,216 --> 01:02:27,207
thejunk...

856
01:02:27,285 --> 01:02:29,276
and that it'll end badly.

857
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:32,320
Really?
And what else did she say?

858
01:02:32,390 --> 01:02:33,880
I'm very curious.

859
01:02:33,991 --> 01:02:36,050
That as an actress,
you're wonderful...

860
01:02:38,296 --> 01:02:40,992
but that as a person,
you're very mixed up.

861
01:02:44,068 --> 01:02:45,433
And what else?

862
01:02:48,906 --> 01:02:50,601
That I shouldn't say anything.

863
01:02:52,443 --> 01:02:54,434
What haveyou got
in the bag?

864
01:02:54,512 --> 01:02:56,673
- Cava and ice cream.
- What for?

865
01:02:56,747 --> 01:02:59,181
To celebrateyour success
last night, bitch.

866
01:02:59,250 --> 01:03:01,184
Thankyou. Come in.

867
01:03:05,990 --> 01:03:08,254
Oh, what a surprise!

868
01:03:08,326 --> 01:03:10,817
Three single girls
in an empty house...

869
01:03:10,895 --> 01:03:13,261
always reminds me of
How To MarryA Millionaire.

870
01:03:13,331 --> 01:03:15,731
- How areyou, Sister Rosa?
- Huma, this is Agrado.

871
01:03:15,800 --> 01:03:17,700
My pleasure. I'm ''fans.''

872
01:03:17,768 --> 01:03:18,996
How areyou?

873
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:22,699
Huma, you're a goddess,
a living legend.

874
01:03:22,773 --> 01:03:24,866
Like I said, I'm ''fans,''
in the plural...

875
01:03:24,942 --> 01:03:28,400
but my Manuela was too much
the other night.

876
01:03:28,479 --> 01:03:32,074
How I bawled
at the evening show!

877
01:03:32,817 --> 01:03:34,808
Shouldn'tyou be
in El Salvador?

878
01:03:34,885 --> 01:03:37,718
Yes, but I'm not going now.
I'm staying here.

879
01:03:37,788 --> 01:03:40,222
Agrado, I don't work
for Huma anymore.

880
01:03:40,291 --> 01:03:44,318
Beforeyou came, we were saying
thatyou could take my place.

881
01:03:44,929 --> 01:03:46,396
Me play Stella?

882
01:03:46,464 --> 01:03:48,455
I see myselfmore as Blanche.

883
01:03:49,967 --> 01:03:52,299
Replacing me, not Nina,
and much less Huma.

884
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,599
Thankyou, Manuela,
but I don't--

885
01:03:54,672 --> 01:03:57,402
Try her for a few days.
She isn't as clueless as she seems.

886
01:03:57,475 --> 01:04:01,002
I am, Huma, and worse.
Right now, I don't get this at all.

887
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:05,540
So I'll giveyou the bottle
to cheer us up a bit.

888
01:04:05,616 --> 01:04:06,742
I brought ice cream.

889
01:04:06,817 --> 01:04:10,810
Come on, let's have a drink
and relax a bit.

890
01:04:10,888 --> 01:04:12,150
I'll get the glasses.

891
01:04:16,694 --> 01:04:19,322
I'll just have some ice cream.
I can't drink alcohol.

892
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:21,024
Well, I'll have a drink.

893
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:25,262
Hey, what's up with Manuela?
She seems very odd.

894
01:04:25,336 --> 01:04:27,930
Success hasn't gone
to her head already, has it?

895
01:04:29,273 --> 01:04:31,207
She wants to dumpyou
on Huma.

896
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,680
I think Prada
is ideal for a nun.

897
01:04:38,749 --> 01:04:42,048
My problem is everything suits me,
so I'm very eclectic.

898
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:44,417
I've had chilblains
since I came to Barcelona.

899
01:04:44,488 --> 01:04:45,887
Oh, really?

900
01:04:45,956 --> 01:04:48,220
It's finished.
Should I get more?

901
01:04:48,292 --> 01:04:50,760
I'd love some, but no.

902
01:04:50,828 --> 01:04:52,921
- Where's the bathroom?
- Straight ahead.

903
01:04:53,998 --> 01:04:55,590
Excuse me.

904
01:04:57,935 --> 01:05:01,803
Fill me in on what's happening here.
I'm no stranger.

905
01:05:01,872 --> 01:05:03,772
- I'll tell you tomorrow.
- No, don't!

906
01:05:03,841 --> 01:05:05,604
She can't keep her mouth shut.

907
01:05:05,676 --> 01:05:07,837
I know verywell
how to keep it shut.

908
01:05:07,912 --> 01:05:11,211
I played along like an English lady
so she wouldn't catch on.

909
01:05:11,282 --> 01:05:15,412
I'm a model ofdiscretion,
even when I'm sucking someone's cock.

910
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:17,579
I've sucked a lot ofcocks
in public places...

911
01:05:17,655 --> 01:05:19,748
and no one's noticed,
except the person involved.

912
01:05:20,891 --> 01:05:23,052
It's been ages
since I sucked a cock!

913
01:05:28,365 --> 01:05:30,765
I love the word ''cock.''

914
01:05:30,835 --> 01:05:32,860
And ''prick''!

915
01:05:34,805 --> 01:05:36,033
I have to go.

916
01:05:36,106 --> 01:05:37,596
- Areyou all right?
- What?

917
01:05:37,675 --> 01:05:39,404
- Areyou all right?
- Better than ever.

918
01:05:39,477 --> 01:05:42,241
Can you help her
find a taxi?

919
01:05:42,847 --> 01:05:45,543
I nearly forgot.
This is foryou.

920
01:05:45,616 --> 01:05:46,981
Thankyou.

921
01:05:47,618 --> 01:05:49,745
- Well, good-bye, girls.
- So long.

922
01:05:54,492 --> 01:05:57,017
You have to teach me
how to bark.

923
01:05:57,895 --> 01:06:02,093
I think I was a bit rude to Huma.
I said all sorts ofthings.

924
01:06:02,166 --> 01:06:04,634
Really?
It doesn't matter.

925
01:06:04,702 --> 01:06:07,136
They're very different for sisters,
aren't they?

926
01:06:07,204 --> 01:06:10,367
- Are they sisters?
- That's what Manuela said.

927
01:06:10,441 --> 01:06:12,375
Well, ifshe says so.

928
01:06:12,443 --> 01:06:16,277
- I thinkyou're all bullshitters.
- You have to get to know us.

929
01:06:16,747 --> 01:06:18,339
Can you drive?

930
01:06:18,415 --> 01:06:21,282
- I used to be a truck driver.
- Really?

931
01:06:21,352 --> 01:06:23,320
In Paris, before I got my tits.

932
01:06:23,387 --> 01:06:26,220
Then I gave up the truck
and became a whore.

933
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:29,054
- How interesting.
- Very.

934
01:06:32,863 --> 01:06:34,956
A check.

935
01:06:35,032 --> 01:06:37,762
-1 50,000.
- How generous!

936
01:06:42,506 --> 01:06:44,440
What is it?

937
01:06:44,508 --> 01:06:47,671
Huma's autograph,
for Esteban.

938
01:06:47,745 --> 01:06:51,647
DearEsteban.: This is
theautograph Inevergaveyou...

939
01:06:51,715 --> 01:06:54,275
andnotbecause
youdidn't try.

940
01:06:58,389 --> 01:07:00,755
Ihavebeen foolish,
casting mypearlsbeforeswine.

941
01:07:00,824 --> 01:07:03,691
- Youmeanme?
- Youandyour friend, Mr. Mitchell.

942
01:07:03,761 --> 01:07:06,787
He came toseeme
andrepeatedtheslanderyou'dtoldhim.

943
01:07:06,864 --> 01:07:09,560
-So I threwhim out.
- You threwMitch out?

944
01:07:10,401 --> 01:07:13,837
He returned with a box ofroses
to beg my forgiveness.

945
01:07:13,904 --> 01:07:17,670
'' Forgive me,'' he said,
but some things are not forgivable.

946
01:07:17,741 --> 01:07:20,335
Cruelty is not forgivable.

947
01:07:20,411 --> 01:07:22,709
It is the one unforgivable thing.

948
01:07:24,048 --> 01:07:25,811
Well?

949
01:07:26,817 --> 01:07:29,581
- Areyou learning the part too?
- Ofcourse not.

950
01:07:29,653 --> 01:07:32,747
- You should,just in case.
- You think so?

951
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:35,156
May I have some privacy?

952
01:07:35,225 --> 01:07:38,786
Soyou can getyour fix?
Can't wait till the end?

953
01:07:38,862 --> 01:07:40,659
Ifyou know, why ask?

954
01:07:42,132 --> 01:07:45,465
Ifyou don't want me to tell Huma,
do it in the bathroom.

955
01:07:45,536 --> 01:07:47,299
I don't need to see these things.

956
01:07:47,838 --> 01:07:49,066
All right.

957
01:07:49,139 --> 01:07:51,403
Keep an eye on the door.

958
01:07:57,181 --> 01:08:00,708
I know that when you'reyoung--
well, you're no child--

959
01:08:00,784 --> 01:08:02,615
you don't value these things.

960
01:08:02,686 --> 01:08:07,123
Butyou're cute,
nicely proportioned--

961
01:08:07,191 --> 01:08:09,182
kind ofsmall, but cute.

962
01:08:09,259 --> 01:08:10,749
You've lost weight--

963
01:08:10,828 --> 01:08:12,796
well, it's all the drugs--

964
01:08:12,863 --> 01:08:15,593
but the important thing is
you've lost weight.

965
01:08:15,666 --> 01:08:17,429
You've got talent--

966
01:08:17,501 --> 01:08:19,662
limited talent,
butyou've got it.

967
01:08:19,737 --> 01:08:22,205
And, above all,
a woman who loves you.

968
01:08:22,272 --> 01:08:24,172
And you trade it all forjunk.

969
01:08:24,241 --> 01:08:26,766
You think it's worth it?
Well, it isn't.

970
01:08:26,844 --> 01:08:28,709
It isn't worth it.

971
01:08:29,913 --> 01:08:33,314
I trade it for a bit ofpeace.
Come on, help me.

972
01:08:40,891 --> 01:08:43,291
You're getting flat
as a board.

973
01:08:44,161 --> 01:08:46,459
Compared toyou.

974
01:08:49,033 --> 01:08:51,228
What a dirty habit!

975
01:08:52,703 --> 01:08:54,796
Haven'tyou ever thought
ofcutting it off?

976
01:08:54,872 --> 01:08:56,567
I'd get no work.

977
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,006
The clients like us pneumatic
and well-hung.

978
01:08:59,076 --> 01:09:02,136
Rheumatic?
Guys are so odd.

979
01:09:02,212 --> 01:09:04,806
Not rheumatic. Pneumatic.

980
01:09:04,882 --> 01:09:07,316
A pair oftits as hard
as newly inflated tires...

981
01:09:07,384 --> 01:09:09,079
and a big dick as well.

982
01:09:10,554 --> 01:09:12,215
Show meyour cock.

983
01:09:12,289 --> 01:09:14,757
That fix didn't agree with you.

984
01:09:14,825 --> 01:09:16,520
Maybe I'll like it too.

985
01:09:16,593 --> 01:09:19,790
You've got enough problems
as it is.

986
01:09:19,863 --> 01:09:23,424
Go, you're on now.
And don't throw up on anybody.

987
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:27,061
The audience loves it.
They think it's because I'm pregnant.

988
01:09:27,137 --> 01:09:30,197
You're not pregnant in this scene.
You've had a doll.

989
01:09:30,274 --> 01:09:32,174
That's right.

990
01:09:38,348 --> 01:09:40,816
Will you show me
your cock later?

991
01:09:40,884 --> 01:09:43,978
I'll show it toyou
and you can lick it.

992
01:09:44,488 --> 01:09:46,422
Young people will try anything!

993
01:09:51,662 --> 01:09:56,599
MONTHS LATER

994
01:10:08,011 --> 01:10:10,138
I'm going to call him Esteban.

995
01:10:10,214 --> 01:10:12,614
Your son?

996
01:10:12,683 --> 01:10:14,514
Why?

997
01:10:14,585 --> 01:10:16,610
Afteryours.

998
01:10:17,454 --> 01:10:20,150
This babywill belong
to both ofus.

999
01:10:21,024 --> 01:10:23,390
Ifonly he did.

1000
01:10:23,460 --> 01:10:26,054
Ifonlywe were alone
in the world...

1001
01:10:26,130 --> 01:10:28,428
without any commitments.

1002
01:10:30,167 --> 01:10:32,965
You and your son,
just for me.

1003
01:10:34,238 --> 01:10:36,399
Butyou have a family.

1004
01:10:38,008 --> 01:10:41,239
I'm going to fixyour hair
and makeyou up a bit.

1005
01:10:41,311 --> 01:10:44,371
- Why?
- I like to seeyou look nice.

1006
01:10:44,448 --> 01:10:46,848
And I called your mother.

1007
01:10:46,917 --> 01:10:48,885
She's coming
to seeyou today.

1008
01:10:48,952 --> 01:10:50,385
My mother?

1009
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:53,514
You have a mother.
Don'tyou remember?

1010
01:10:55,459 --> 01:10:57,427
What will I tell her?

1011
01:10:58,095 --> 01:11:00,757
Thatyou love her--
I don't know.

1012
01:11:04,601 --> 01:11:06,592
Come in, Huma.

1013
01:11:07,271 --> 01:11:09,466
No, it isn't Huma.
May I come in?

1014
01:11:09,540 --> 01:11:11,531
Ofcourse, Mario.
Come in.

1015
01:11:12,910 --> 01:11:15,538
- You're very early today.
- Yes.

1016
01:11:17,114 --> 01:11:20,379
- What areyou doing?
-Just a bit ofironing.

1017
01:11:20,918 --> 01:11:22,818
Is anything wrong?

1018
01:11:22,886 --> 01:11:25,650
I didn't sleep verywell
last night.

1019
01:11:25,722 --> 01:11:28,748
I've been on edge all day.

1020
01:11:28,826 --> 01:11:30,919
Would you give me
a blowjob?

1021
01:11:32,229 --> 01:11:35,665
Can'tyou all get it intoyour heads
that I'm retired?

1022
01:11:35,732 --> 01:11:37,962
I don't wantyou to think that...

1023
01:11:38,035 --> 01:11:40,094
but since I've been
on edge all day...

1024
01:11:40,170 --> 01:11:42,604
I think a blowjob
would relax me.

1025
01:11:42,673 --> 01:11:45,267
You give me one.
I'm on edge too.

1026
01:11:45,809 --> 01:11:49,040
Well, it would be the first time
I've sucked a woman's cock...

1027
01:11:49,112 --> 01:11:51,080
but ifthat's what it takes--

1028
01:11:51,148 --> 01:11:53,309
The whole company
is obsessed with my cock!

1029
01:11:53,383 --> 01:11:56,284
It isn't the only one around.
Don'tyou have a cock?

1030
01:11:56,353 --> 01:11:57,342
Yes.

1031
01:11:57,421 --> 01:12:01,380
Do people askyou to suck their cocks
becauseyou've got one?

1032
01:12:01,825 --> 01:12:02,814
- Do they?
- No.

1033
01:12:02,893 --> 01:12:04,520
Well, then?

1034
01:12:05,696 --> 01:12:08,494
Look, I'll suckyou off
to showyou how open-minded...

1035
01:12:08,565 --> 01:12:11,762
and how sensitive
I am about these things.

1036
01:12:11,835 --> 01:12:13,803
Where's the fucking phone?

1037
01:12:13,871 --> 01:12:14,860
Hello?

1038
01:12:24,147 --> 01:12:26,741
All right, don't worry.
I'll see to everything.

1039
01:12:29,553 --> 01:12:32,113
Shall we go to my room?
In case Huma comes--

1040
01:12:32,189 --> 01:12:35,352
Huma can't come.
She's in the hospital, along with Nina.

1041
01:12:35,425 --> 01:12:39,521
- What's happened?
- They nearly killed each other.

1042
01:12:39,596 --> 01:12:41,530
Fuck!

1043
01:12:44,334 --> 01:12:45,323
Here.

1044
01:12:45,402 --> 01:12:47,165
We'll have to cancel
the performance.

1045
01:12:47,237 --> 01:12:49,262
- Don't say anything.
- We have to say something.

1046
01:12:49,339 --> 01:12:51,330
Yes, but it doesn't have
to be the truth.

1047
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:54,241
- I'll make something up.
- Right.

1048
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,076
And--

1049
01:13:00,751 --> 01:13:02,946
- Hello, how areyou?
- Hello.

1050
01:13:03,620 --> 01:13:05,247
Come in.

1051
01:13:10,060 --> 01:13:13,496
- Where is she?
- There, in the bedroom.

1052
01:13:33,617 --> 01:13:37,417
And here I was so worried,
thinking you were in El Salvador.

1053
01:13:38,355 --> 01:13:40,585
I seeyou've learned to lie.

1054
01:13:40,657 --> 01:13:42,921
I didn't know
how to tell you.

1055
01:13:43,026 --> 01:13:45,017
What areyou going to do now?

1056
01:13:45,095 --> 01:13:47,256
Leave the order?
Get married?

1057
01:13:47,331 --> 01:13:49,629
Mom, the things you ask!

1058
01:13:50,267 --> 01:13:52,599
One never knows with you.

1059
01:13:52,669 --> 01:13:54,967
At least, I don't.

1060
01:13:55,372 --> 01:13:58,535
Even this I had to learn about
through your friend.

1061
01:14:00,911 --> 01:14:03,880
What would I have done
without her?

1062
01:14:04,147 --> 01:14:05,307
How's Dad?

1063
01:14:05,382 --> 01:14:07,976
Same as ever.
I don't know.

1064
01:14:08,051 --> 01:14:09,951
Worse.

1065
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,515
Ifyou don't mind,
I'd rather not tell him anything.

1066
01:14:15,859 --> 01:14:19,090
He wouldn't get it anyway.

1067
01:14:20,230 --> 01:14:22,721
- And Sapic?
- Fine.

1068
01:14:28,071 --> 01:14:30,505
Rosa, I don't know
what to do.

1069
01:14:32,175 --> 01:14:33,972
What doyou expect me
to do?

1070
01:14:35,812 --> 01:14:37,370
Nothing, Mom.

1071
01:14:39,082 --> 01:14:42,074
You don't expect
anything from me?

1072
01:14:43,487 --> 01:14:45,751
It isn't that.

1073
01:14:46,256 --> 01:14:49,555
What I mean is
don't make it harder for me.

1074
01:15:04,374 --> 01:15:06,274
Would you like anything?
I'm making tea.

1075
01:15:06,343 --> 01:15:07,776
No, thankyou.

1076
01:15:07,844 --> 01:15:11,712
What exactly is wrong?
I didn't understand over the phone.

1077
01:15:11,782 --> 01:15:14,717
According to the ultrasound,
she's got placenta previa.

1078
01:15:14,785 --> 01:15:18,118
When the time comes,
she'll need a caesarian.

1079
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:20,452
In the meantime,
she must have complete rest.

1080
01:15:20,524 --> 01:15:22,355
Doyou think
I should take her home?

1081
01:15:22,426 --> 01:15:25,953
I have to look after her father
as ifhe were a child.

1082
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:28,896
You're her mother...

1083
01:15:28,965 --> 01:15:31,627
but I think
Rosa's better-offhere.

1084
01:15:31,701 --> 01:15:34,499
That's the impression
she gave me.

1085
01:15:34,571 --> 01:15:36,664
Ifyou need money,
just ask me.

1086
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,335
- And, please, keep me informed.
- Yes. Don't worry.

1087
01:15:40,410 --> 01:15:41,809
Thankyou very much.

1088
01:15:41,878 --> 01:15:43,709
- I'll seeyou out.
- No, really.

1089
01:15:47,818 --> 01:15:50,946
I don't know
what I did wrong with Rosa.

1090
01:15:51,655 --> 01:15:54,624
Ever since she was born,
she's been like an alien.

1091
01:15:55,192 --> 01:15:57,319
Doyou have children?

1092
01:15:57,394 --> 01:15:59,157
Yes, one.

1093
01:15:59,229 --> 01:16:01,959
Doyou get along well
with him?

1094
01:16:02,999 --> 01:16:05,433
He died.

1095
01:16:06,603 --> 01:16:08,901
I'm sorry.

1096
01:16:30,026 --> 01:16:32,392
Due to reasons
beyond their control...

1097
01:16:32,462 --> 01:16:36,489
two ofthe actresses
who triumph daily on this stage...

1098
01:16:36,566 --> 01:16:39,831
cannot be here tonight--
the poor things.

1099
01:16:39,903 --> 01:16:42,599
So the show
has been cancelled.

1100
01:16:43,373 --> 01:16:46,103
Those who wish
can get their money back...

1101
01:16:46,176 --> 01:16:48,701
but for those who have
nothing better to do...

1102
01:16:48,812 --> 01:16:51,838
it's a shame to waste the rare occasion
thatyou make it to the theater.

1103
01:16:52,349 --> 01:16:53,748
Ifyou stay...

1104
01:16:53,817 --> 01:16:57,309
I promise to entertain you
with my life story.

1105
01:16:59,422 --> 01:17:01,617
Good-bye. I'm very sorry.

1106
01:17:01,758 --> 01:17:05,421
IfI boreyou, you can pretend
to snore-- like this.

1107
01:17:05,996 --> 01:17:09,523
I'll get the idea, and you certainly
won't hurt my feelings.

1108
01:17:09,599 --> 01:17:11,328
Honestly.

1109
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,199
They call me '' La Agrado''...

1110
01:17:15,272 --> 01:17:19,299
because I've always tried
to make people's lives agreeable.

1111
01:17:21,077 --> 01:17:25,036
As well as being agreeable,
I'm very authentic!

1112
01:17:25,649 --> 01:17:27,310
Look at this body!

1113
01:17:28,785 --> 01:17:30,844
All made to measure.

1114
01:17:31,555 --> 01:17:34,752
Almond-shaped eyes-- 80,000.

1115
01:17:36,092 --> 01:17:37,855
Nose-- 200,000.

1116
01:17:37,928 --> 01:17:41,489
A waste ofmoney. Another beating
the following year left it like this.

1117
01:17:41,565 --> 01:17:44,261
It gives me character,
but ifI'd known...

1118
01:17:44,334 --> 01:17:46,302
I wouldn't have touched it.

1119
01:17:46,369 --> 01:17:47,495
I'll continue.

1120
01:17:47,571 --> 01:17:51,132
Tits-- two,
because I'm no monster.

1121
01:17:51,208 --> 01:17:55,508
70,000 each,
but I've more than earned that back.

1122
01:17:55,579 --> 01:17:56,773
Silicone in--

1123
01:17:56,846 --> 01:17:58,074
Where?

1124
01:17:58,148 --> 01:18:00,514
Lips, forehead, cheeks...

1125
01:18:00,584 --> 01:18:02,074
hips and ass.

1126
01:18:02,152 --> 01:18:03,813
A pint costs about 1 00,000...

1127
01:18:03,887 --> 01:18:06,549
soyou work it out,
because I've lost count.

1128
01:18:06,623 --> 01:18:08,750
Jaw reduction-- 75,000.

1129
01:18:08,825 --> 01:18:10,417
Complete laser depilation...

1130
01:18:10,493 --> 01:18:12,984
because women, like men,
also come from apes.

1131
01:18:13,063 --> 01:18:14,724
60,000 a session.

1132
01:18:14,798 --> 01:18:19,030
It depends how hairyyou are.
Usually, two to four sessions.

1133
01:18:19,102 --> 01:18:23,129
But ifyou're a flamenco diva,
you'll need more.

1134
01:18:26,643 --> 01:18:28,406
Well, as I was saying...

1135
01:18:28,478 --> 01:18:30,844
it costs a lot
to be authentic, ma'am.

1136
01:18:30,914 --> 01:18:33,041
And one can't be stingy
with these things...

1137
01:18:33,116 --> 01:18:35,550
becauseyou are more authentic...

1138
01:18:35,619 --> 01:18:38,986
the moreyou resemble
whatyou've dreamed ofbeing.

1139
01:18:51,234 --> 01:18:53,065
I'll turn you around.

1140
01:18:53,136 --> 01:18:55,536
- Please, be careful.
- Don't worry.

1141
01:18:56,006 --> 01:18:58,975
We'll lift up a bit.
That's it.

1142
01:19:00,243 --> 01:19:02,177
- Areyou all right?
- Yes.

1143
01:19:02,245 --> 01:19:04,145
Ifyou can push it over here--

1144
01:19:05,415 --> 01:19:07,474
- I'll put this away.
- Thankyou.

1145
01:19:07,550 --> 01:19:09,848
- Can you manage?
- Yes.

1146
01:19:15,458 --> 01:19:17,517
To the Hospital del Mar,
please.

1147
01:19:18,328 --> 01:19:20,990
Can we go
through Medinaceli Square?

1148
01:19:21,064 --> 01:19:24,227
Aren't we meeting your mother
at the hospital?

1149
01:19:25,101 --> 01:19:28,195
- I just want to see the square.
- All right.

1150
01:19:35,879 --> 01:19:37,608
Stop here!

1151
01:19:39,349 --> 01:19:41,943
I played here as a child.

1152
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:49,724
Sapic!

1153
01:20:02,272 --> 01:20:05,264
Come here, boy!

1154
01:20:08,678 --> 01:20:10,839
Hello, Sapic.

1155
01:20:12,515 --> 01:20:15,245
That dog would go
with anybody.

1156
01:20:15,885 --> 01:20:17,682
Doyou have a dog?

1157
01:20:18,254 --> 01:20:20,848
No, but I really like them.

1158
01:20:20,924 --> 01:20:24,360
- How old areyou?
- Twenty-six.

1159
01:20:25,829 --> 01:20:30,027
- And how tall areyou?
- Not very. Five six.

1160
01:20:34,771 --> 01:20:35,863
Come on.

1161
01:20:35,939 --> 01:20:37,873
Go on.
Go back to Dad.

1162
01:20:37,941 --> 01:20:38,965
Come on.

1163
01:20:39,876 --> 01:20:41,901
Good-bye, Dad.

1164
01:20:48,952 --> 01:20:51,386
- You aren't in any pain?
- No.

1165
01:20:52,555 --> 01:20:55,285
That's great.
Painless childbirth.

1166
01:20:57,460 --> 01:20:59,553
When is she going
into surgery?

1167
01:21:00,096 --> 01:21:01,893
In an hour and a half.

1168
01:21:03,867 --> 01:21:07,928
I've got time to go check
on your father and come back.

1169
01:21:08,171 --> 01:21:10,731
You don't have
to come back, Mom.

1170
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,565
I want to be here
with you.

1171
01:21:16,246 --> 01:21:18,043
Give Dad a kiss for me.

1172
01:21:18,114 --> 01:21:20,810
I'm keeping this one.

1173
01:21:29,993 --> 01:21:31,255
So long.

1174
01:21:31,327 --> 01:21:32,919
Good-bye.

1175
01:21:36,566 --> 01:21:39,797
I hope the third Esteban
is the definitive one foryou.

1176
01:21:39,869 --> 01:21:42,133
The third Esteban?

1177
01:21:42,205 --> 01:21:44,400
Lola was the first...

1178
01:21:44,474 --> 01:21:46,101
and your son, the second.

1179
01:21:46,176 --> 01:21:49,168
Soyou knew Lola
was the father ofmy son too.

1180
01:21:49,245 --> 01:21:51,110
Ofcourse.

1181
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:53,479
It didn't take a genius.

1182
01:21:53,550 --> 01:21:55,916
Lola doesn't know
we had a son.

1183
01:21:55,985 --> 01:21:58,215
I never told him.

1184
01:21:58,855 --> 01:22:01,380
Did your son know?

1185
01:22:01,458 --> 01:22:03,653
No, he didn't.

1186
01:22:05,428 --> 01:22:08,522
Let's not talk about sad things.
This is a great day.

1187
01:22:08,598 --> 01:22:12,329
They've put Videla injail,
and your son's going to be born.

1188
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:17,732
- Promise me one thing.
- What?

1189
01:22:18,908 --> 01:22:22,173
- Ifanything happens--
- What could happen?

1190
01:22:22,245 --> 01:22:24,236
Promiseyou won't hide anything
from the child.

1191
01:22:24,314 --> 01:22:28,375
I don't have to. You can tell him
whateveryou wantyourself.

1192
01:22:28,451 --> 01:22:30,942
Promise me.

1193
01:22:31,321 --> 01:22:33,687
Ifit makes you happier.

1194
01:22:35,692 --> 01:22:37,250
All right.

1195
01:22:37,327 --> 01:22:39,795
I promise.

1196
01:22:57,447 --> 01:23:01,816
We are here today
to say good-bye to our sister Rosa.

1197
01:23:33,383 --> 01:23:36,181
Manuela, I'm so happy
to seeyou.

1198
01:23:36,252 --> 01:23:38,015
What a pity
it has to be here.

1199
01:23:38,721 --> 01:23:40,348
It couldn't be
anywhere else.

1200
01:23:41,858 --> 01:23:45,555
You aren't a human being, Lola.
You're an epidemic!

1201
01:23:46,696 --> 01:23:49,256
I was always excessive.

1202
01:23:49,332 --> 01:23:51,732
And I'm very tired.

1203
01:23:52,302 --> 01:23:54,031
Manuela, I'm dying.

1204
01:23:56,105 --> 01:23:57,094
Come.

1205
01:24:00,310 --> 01:24:02,244
I'm saying good-bye
to everything.

1206
01:24:02,312 --> 01:24:05,804
I robbed Agrado
to pay my ticket to Argentina.

1207
01:24:06,482 --> 01:24:09,610
I wanted to take a last look
at the town...

1208
01:24:09,686 --> 01:24:11,244
the river...

1209
01:24:11,321 --> 01:24:12,652
our street.

1210
01:24:14,190 --> 01:24:17,489
And I'm happy
I can say good-bye toyou too.

1211
01:24:18,728 --> 01:24:22,289
Now I just have to see
Sister Rosa's child.

1212
01:24:23,032 --> 01:24:25,227
My son.

1213
01:24:27,236 --> 01:24:30,637
I always dreamed ofhaving a son.
You know that.

1214
01:24:31,407 --> 01:24:33,841
When I left Barcelona,
I was carrying your child.

1215
01:24:34,444 --> 01:24:35,433
What?

1216
01:24:37,246 --> 01:24:38,736
You mean you too-

1217
01:24:40,316 --> 01:24:42,307
Did you have it?

1218
01:24:42,986 --> 01:24:44,681
A beautiful boy.

1219
01:24:44,754 --> 01:24:47,450
I want to see him.
Did you bring him with you?

1220
01:24:47,523 --> 01:24:49,991
He's in Madrid,
butyou can't see him.

1221
01:24:50,860 --> 01:24:54,193
Even from a distance.
I promise he won't see me.

1222
01:24:55,865 --> 01:24:57,799
It's the last thing
I ask ofyou.

1223
01:24:58,601 --> 01:25:00,831
You can't see him.

1224
01:25:01,537 --> 01:25:03,437
Please!

1225
01:25:07,844 --> 01:25:11,610
Six months ago,
he was run over by a car.

1226
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:15,140
He's dead.

1227
01:25:25,328 --> 01:25:28,991
I only came to Barcelona
to tell you.

1228
01:25:29,065 --> 01:25:31,158
I'm sorry.

1229
01:25:58,594 --> 01:26:00,391
The baby!

1230
01:26:00,963 --> 01:26:02,988
Where haveyou been?

1231
01:26:03,066 --> 01:26:04,863
Haven'tyou taken
Sapic outyet?

1232
01:26:04,934 --> 01:26:08,097
- You weren't here.
- I'm here now.

1233
01:26:13,242 --> 01:26:14,573
He's hungry.

1234
01:26:14,644 --> 01:26:17,841
- The bottle's heating.
- Will you get it, please?

1235
01:26:17,914 --> 01:26:19,438
Come here.

1236
01:26:20,083 --> 01:26:22,677
Vicenta, don't let my husband
come in here, please.

1237
01:26:22,752 --> 01:26:25,050
He's convinced
the baby's yours.

1238
01:26:25,121 --> 01:26:27,089
Yes, I know.

1239
01:26:28,658 --> 01:26:30,717
He's veryjealous.

1240
01:26:30,793 --> 01:26:32,954
I told him
the babywas yours.

1241
01:26:33,029 --> 01:26:34,758
I don't dare
tell him the truth.

1242
01:26:34,831 --> 01:26:37,095
He wouldn't understand
anyway.

1243
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,597
Ifonly he were mine.

1244
01:26:42,038 --> 01:26:43,505
What is it?

1245
01:26:43,573 --> 01:26:45,268
Who's that woman?

1246
01:26:45,341 --> 01:26:47,639
It's Manuela,
the new cook.

1247
01:26:47,710 --> 01:26:50,304
She's been with us
four days.

1248
01:26:50,379 --> 01:26:53,780
We've fixed up this room
so she can be here with her child.

1249
01:26:53,850 --> 01:26:55,977
Remember?
I told you.

1250
01:26:56,786 --> 01:26:59,448
- How old areyou?
- Thirty-eight.

1251
01:27:00,089 --> 01:27:03,024
- How tall areyou?
- Five seven.

1252
01:27:04,227 --> 01:27:05,489
All right.

1253
01:27:05,561 --> 01:27:07,927
Nowyou can go
for a walk.

1254
01:27:10,366 --> 01:27:12,334
Go on.

1255
01:27:12,869 --> 01:27:14,131
Thereyou are.

1256
01:27:14,470 --> 01:27:17,166
- The bottle, ma'am.
- Thankyou.

1257
01:27:19,108 --> 01:27:20,769
Thankyou.

1258
01:27:21,110 --> 01:27:23,078
No, no.
We're going to eat now.

1259
01:27:27,450 --> 01:27:28,576
Yes?

1260
01:27:28,651 --> 01:27:30,949
Don't tell anyone
about the antibodies.

1261
01:27:36,058 --> 01:27:37,787
Do the nuns know?

1262
01:27:40,463 --> 01:27:42,328
All right.

1263
01:27:50,673 --> 01:27:54,575
ONE MONTH LATER

1264
01:28:16,465 --> 01:28:18,262
Hello, Lola.

1265
01:28:20,603 --> 01:28:22,400
Take him.

1266
01:28:31,848 --> 01:28:33,679
What did the doctor say?

1267
01:28:33,749 --> 01:28:36,377
He's fine.
You can see-- he's normal.

1268
01:28:39,622 --> 01:28:41,783
You're with Dad.

1269
01:28:42,758 --> 01:28:45,750
- Can I give him a kiss?
- Ofcourse.

1270
01:28:50,967 --> 01:28:54,528
My son, I'm sorry to leaveyou
such an awful inheritance.

1271
01:28:54,604 --> 01:28:56,037
Don't say that.

1272
01:28:56,105 --> 01:28:59,836
There's no reason why
he should develop the disease.

1273
01:29:13,422 --> 01:29:15,083
This is our Esteban.

1274
01:29:18,594 --> 01:29:20,459
You called him Esteban too?

1275
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:26,463
Thankyou.

1276
01:29:31,908 --> 01:29:34,138
He wanted to be a writer.

1277
01:29:34,410 --> 01:29:39,245
This is his notebook.
He took it with him everywhere.

1278
01:29:39,315 --> 01:29:42,216
He wrote this
the morning ofthe day he died.

1279
01:29:44,120 --> 01:29:46,179
Read it.

1280
01:29:46,689 --> 01:29:48,953
''Last night
Mom showed me a picture.

1281
01:29:50,126 --> 01:29:52,253
Halfofit was missing.

1282
01:29:53,162 --> 01:29:57,462
I didn't want to tell her,
but my life is missing that same half.''

1283
01:30:00,369 --> 01:30:02,166
Keep reading.

1284
01:30:06,776 --> 01:30:08,676
''This morning
I looked through her drawers...

1285
01:30:08,744 --> 01:30:11,736
and found
a bundle ofpictures.

1286
01:30:12,515 --> 01:30:14,881
Theywere all missing
a half.

1287
01:30:15,718 --> 01:30:17,447
My father, I suppose.

1288
01:30:20,556 --> 01:30:23,150
I want to meet him.

1289
01:30:23,225 --> 01:30:26,592
I have to make Mom understand
that I don't care who he is...

1290
01:30:26,662 --> 01:30:28,323
orwhat he's like...

1291
01:30:28,397 --> 01:30:30,661
or how he behaved towards her.

1292
01:30:32,068 --> 01:30:34,901
She can't deny me
that right.''

1293
01:30:40,476 --> 01:30:42,137
Keep the picture.

1294
01:30:45,881 --> 01:30:48,076
Thankyou.

1295
01:31:03,499 --> 01:31:05,399
I don't likejust anyone
kissing the baby.

1296
01:31:05,468 --> 01:31:07,868
Who was that woman
in the barwith you?

1297
01:31:07,937 --> 01:31:10,565
That woman is his father.

1298
01:31:10,639 --> 01:31:12,368
What did you say?

1299
01:31:12,441 --> 01:31:15,376
That was his father,
and he's very ill.

1300
01:31:15,778 --> 01:31:19,236
That monster is the one
who killed my daughter?

1301
01:31:21,250 --> 01:31:23,775
Don't think about that,
Rosa.

1302
01:31:35,231 --> 01:31:38,826
There are people who think
children are made in a day.

1303
01:31:39,535 --> 01:31:43,198
But it takes a long time--
a very long time.

1304
01:31:44,173 --> 01:31:48,633
That's why it's so awful to see
your child's blood on the ground.

1305
01:31:49,912 --> 01:31:54,406
A stream that flows for a minute
and yet costs us years.

1306
01:32:00,256 --> 01:32:02,690
When I found my son...

1307
01:32:03,159 --> 01:32:06,253
he was lying
in the middle ofthe street.

1308
01:32:16,605 --> 01:32:20,268
I soaked my hands in his blood
and licked them.

1309
01:32:21,177 --> 01:32:23,668
Because it was mine.

1310
01:32:26,182 --> 01:32:29,276
Animals lick theiryoung,
don't they?

1311
01:32:30,820 --> 01:32:33,983
I'm not disgusted
by my son.

1312
01:32:35,391 --> 01:32:38,383
You don't know
what it's like.

1313
01:32:40,596 --> 01:32:43,588
In a monstrance
ofglass and topaz...

1314
01:32:45,000 --> 01:32:48,766
I would put
the earth soaked by his blood.

1315
01:32:55,678 --> 01:32:57,612
Keep kneading.

1316
01:32:57,680 --> 01:33:00,205
The sadness should go
intoyour hands.

1317
01:33:00,449 --> 01:33:03,577
Work. You have to work.

1318
01:33:04,687 --> 01:33:07,622
- You don't notice my cold?
- No, it's fine.

1319
01:33:08,057 --> 01:33:10,389
Come on.
You shouldn't be in here.

1320
01:33:12,628 --> 01:33:13,822
Hello.

1321
01:33:13,896 --> 01:33:15,887
I've got a bouquet
forAgrado and Huma Rojo.

1322
01:33:15,965 --> 01:33:18,627
- Really?
- Yes. Sign here, please.

1323
01:33:18,701 --> 01:33:21,465
- You sure it's forAgrado?
- Yes, it says so.

1324
01:33:23,606 --> 01:33:24,595
Here.

1325
01:33:24,673 --> 01:33:26,868
Know why they call me
Agrado?

1326
01:33:27,676 --> 01:33:30,873
I've always tried
to make life agreeable for others.

1327
01:33:30,946 --> 01:33:32,641
Right.

1328
01:33:37,887 --> 01:33:39,411
''DearAgrado and Huma:

1329
01:33:39,488 --> 01:33:41,718
Running away once again
with no good-byes...

1330
01:33:41,790 --> 01:33:44,190
though I know how much
you like them, Agrado.''

1331
01:33:44,260 --> 01:33:47,525
Thesituation with Rosa'sparents
is unbearable.

TWO YEARS LATER

1343
01:34:20,629 --> 01:34:24,258
I'm comingback to Barcelona
aftertwoyears...

1344
01:34:24,333 --> 01:34:26,130
but this time
I'm notrunningaway.

1345
01:34:26,202 --> 01:34:30,161
I'mgoing toanAIDSconference
organizedby Can Ruti.

1346
01:34:30,239 --> 01:34:34,175
My Estebanhasneutralized
the virus in record time...

1347
01:34:34,243 --> 01:34:36,143
andthey want tostudy
his case.

1348
01:34:36,212 --> 01:34:38,009
I'msohappy.

1349
01:34:40,382 --> 01:34:42,373
May I?

1350
01:34:45,621 --> 01:34:47,953
Hey, she's mine too!

1351
01:34:49,625 --> 01:34:52,355
You look beautiful!
Your hair's gotten so long.

1352
01:34:52,428 --> 01:34:55,522
- And so has yours.
- No, this is a wig for the play.

1353
01:34:55,598 --> 01:34:58,123
Wait, your earring's loose.
I'll fix it.

1354
01:34:58,200 --> 01:34:59,497
Learn, you animal!

1355
01:34:59,568 --> 01:35:02,401
An animal, but who
takes care ofyou like I do?

1356
01:35:02,471 --> 01:35:04,598
It's great aboutyour son!

1357
01:35:04,673 --> 01:35:07,301
So he's neutralized the virus
practically overnight.

1358
01:35:07,376 --> 01:35:10,812
Yes. Esteban's case
proves the virus can disappear.

1359
01:35:10,879 --> 01:35:14,679
They're still trying to find out why,
but it's a miracle.

1360
01:35:14,750 --> 01:35:17,981
I knew it.
How I prayed for that child.

1361
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,050
Why not staywith us
whileyou're in Barcelona?

1362
01:35:21,123 --> 01:35:22,112
Ofcourse.

1363
01:35:22,191 --> 01:35:24,022
We're staying
with his grandparents.

1364
01:35:24,093 --> 01:35:26,118
Rosa's mother
is looking forward to it.

1365
01:35:26,195 --> 01:35:28,425
She's changed so much.

1366
01:35:28,497 --> 01:35:30,761
- Third call, five minutes.
- I have to go.

1367
01:35:34,403 --> 01:35:36,200
You've got Esteban's picture.

1368
01:35:36,272 --> 01:35:38,638
Lola gave it to me
before she died.

1369
01:35:38,707 --> 01:35:41,608
I was keeping it
until you came back.

1370
01:35:41,677 --> 01:35:43,269
Keep it.

1371
01:35:44,213 --> 01:35:45,976
Thankyou.

1372
01:35:48,651 --> 01:35:50,312
And Nina?

1373
01:35:51,120 --> 01:35:53,088
I have to go.

1374
01:35:54,390 --> 01:35:57,188
Nina got married.
She's back in her home town.

1375
01:35:57,259 --> 01:35:59,921
She's got a baby too.
It's fat and horrible.

1376
01:35:59,995 --> 01:36:02,361
Really, really ugly.

1377
01:36:05,834 --> 01:36:07,768
