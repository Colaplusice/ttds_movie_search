00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,408
[Hubbub]

2
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:35,163
[Munches]

3
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:39,672
- Ah. It was a fine meal.
- Yes, it was, wasn't it?

4
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,270
Yes, what should we do now?

5
00:02:41,344 --> 00:02:44,956
- Let's have lunch.
- Oh, good idea.

6
00:02:45,024 --> 00:02:46,911
Quiet down, you villains.

7
00:02:46,975 --> 00:02:49,431
[Pumpkin] I'm being stolen.
Help me, help me!

8
00:02:49,503 --> 00:02:51,292
[Pumpkin] Put me down!

9
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,694
[Children chatter]

10
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,937
Hello.

11
00:02:56,096 --> 00:02:57,525
[Dog barks]

12
00:03:00,863 --> 00:03:02,587
What about my nose?

13
00:03:02,656 --> 00:03:03,604
[Yelps]

14
00:03:05,088 --> 00:03:07,576
[Woman, cackling]
Banana peels coming down!

15
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,693
Come along, ladies.
Here's a nice Christmas turkey.

16
00:03:12,768 --> 00:03:15,419
Turkey.
Get your Christmas turkey.

17
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,586
Hey, get back in the box, Martin!

18
00:03:18,655 --> 00:03:22,398
Get your boomerang fish.
Guaranteed fresh.

19
00:03:22,464 --> 00:03:26,293
Throw the fish away
and it comes back to me.

20
00:03:26,368 --> 00:03:28,059
Get 'em while they're fresh.

21
00:03:28,128 --> 00:03:30,135
- Christmas apples.
- We got Macintosh.

22
00:03:30,208 --> 00:03:32,095
- Christmas apples.
- Red Delicious.

23
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:33,982
Tuppence apiece, while they last.

24
00:03:34,048 --> 00:03:37,114
We... They won't last long
the way you're eating them.

25
00:03:37,184 --> 00:03:39,835
I'm creating scarcity.
Drives the prices up.

26
00:03:39,904 --> 00:03:41,759
- Rizzo...
- [Rizzo clears throat]

27
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:45,566
Hello. Welcome to
the Muppet Christmas Carol.

28
00:03:45,631 --> 00:03:47,289
I am here to tell the story.

29
00:03:47,359 --> 00:03:49,050
And I am here for the food.

30
00:03:49,119 --> 00:03:50,843
My name is Charles Dickens.

31
00:03:50,912 --> 00:03:52,821
And my name is Rizzo the Rat.

32
00:03:52,896 --> 00:03:55,482
Wait a second,
you're not Charles Dickens.

33
00:03:55,552 --> 00:03:56,729
I am, too.

34
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,669
A blue furry Charles Dickens
who hangs out with a rat?

35
00:03:59,744 --> 00:04:00,823
Absolutely.

36
00:04:00,895 --> 00:04:03,579
Charles Dickens
was a 19th century novelist.

37
00:04:03,648 --> 00:04:04,825
A genius.

38
00:04:04,895 --> 00:04:06,619
You are too kind.

39
00:04:06,688 --> 00:04:08,510
Why should I believe you?

40
00:04:08,575 --> 00:04:12,023
Because I know the story of <i>A Christmas</i>
<i>Carol like the back of my hand.</i>

41
00:04:12,096 --> 00:04:14,201
- Prove it.
- All right.

42
00:04:14,272 --> 00:04:16,541
There's a little mole on my thumb.

43
00:04:16,607 --> 00:04:19,956
And a scar on my wrist
from when I fell off my bicycle...

44
00:04:20,032 --> 00:04:22,847
No, don't tell us your hand,
tell us the story.

45
00:04:22,912 --> 00:04:24,919
Oh, thank you. Yes.

46
00:04:24,991 --> 00:04:27,991
The Marleys were dead,
to begin with.

47
00:04:28,064 --> 00:04:29,209
The... Pardon me?

48
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,938
That's how the story begins,

49
00:04:31,007 --> 00:04:33,309
"The Marleys were dead,
to begin with."

50
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:35,709
As dead as a doornail.

51
00:04:35,776 --> 00:04:39,037
It's a good beginning.
It's creepy and kind of... spooky.

52
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:41,689
- Thank you, Rizzo.
- You're welcome, Mr. Dickens.

53
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:44,411
In life, the Marleys had been
business partners

54
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:48,703
with a shrewd moneylender
named Ebenezer Scrooge.

55
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,735
You will meet him
as he comes around that corner.

56
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:53,052
- Where?
- There.

57
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,127
- When?
- Now.

58
00:04:56,991 --> 00:05:00,308
[Dickens] There he is,
Mr. Ebenezer Scrooge.

59
00:05:04,224 --> 00:05:07,387
Say, is it getting cold around here?
[Shudders]

60
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:15,323
<i>When a cold wind blows,</i>
<i>it chills you</i>

61
00:05:15,392 --> 00:05:17,301
<i>Chills you to the bone</i>

62
00:05:17,376 --> 00:05:19,765
<i>But there's nothing in nature</i>
<i>that freezes your heart</i>

63
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,749
<i>Like years of being alone</i>

64
00:05:21,824 --> 00:05:24,507
<i>It paints you with indifference</i>

65
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:26,812
<i>Like a lady paints with rouge</i>

66
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:29,214
<i>And the worst of the worst,</i>
<i>the most hated and cursed</i>

67
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,516
<i>Is the one that we call Scrooge</i>

68
00:05:31,583 --> 00:05:33,917
- <i>Unkind as any</i>
- <i>And the wrath of many</i>

69
00:05:33,984 --> 00:05:35,926
<i>This is Ebenezer Scrooge</i>

70
00:05:35,999 --> 00:05:40,734
<i>There goes Mr. Humbug</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Grim</i>

71
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:43,320
<i>If they gave a prize for being mean</i>

72
00:05:43,392 --> 00:05:45,399
<i>The winner would be him</i>

73
00:05:45,472 --> 00:05:47,414
<i>Old Scrooge, he loves his money</i>

74
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:50,139
<i>'Cause he thinks it gives him power</i>

75
00:05:50,208 --> 00:05:55,991
<i>If he became a flavor</i>
<i>You can bet he would be sour</i>

76
00:05:56,064 --> 00:05:58,235
Even the vegetables don't like him.

77
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:04,181
<i>There goes Mr. Skinflint</i>
<i>There goes Mr. Greed</i>

78
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,112
<i>The undisputed master</i>
<i>of the underhanded deed</i>

79
00:06:09,183 --> 00:06:11,158
<i>He charges folks a fortune</i>

80
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:13,817
<i>For his dark and drafty houses</i>

81
00:06:13,887 --> 00:06:16,124
<i>Us poor folk live in misery</i>

82
00:06:16,192 --> 00:06:19,541
<i>It's even worse for mouses</i>

83
00:06:19,616 --> 00:06:22,998
Please, sir, I want some cheese.

84
00:06:23,071 --> 00:06:25,526
<i>He must be so lonely</i>

85
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:27,803
<i>He must be so sad</i>

86
00:06:27,871 --> 00:06:32,443
<i>He goes to extremes</i>
<i>to convince us he's bad</i>

87
00:06:32,512 --> 00:06:34,901
<i>He's really a victim</i>

88
00:06:34,976 --> 00:06:37,277
<i>Of fear and of pride</i>

89
00:06:37,344 --> 00:06:42,745
<i>Look close and there must be</i>
<i>a sweet man inside</i>

90
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:44,949
- Nah.
- Uh-uh.

91
00:06:45,024 --> 00:06:47,358
<i>There goes Mr. Outrage</i>

92
00:06:47,423 --> 00:06:49,790
<i>There goes Mr. Sneer</i>

93
00:06:49,855 --> 00:06:51,994
<i>He has no time for friends or fun</i>

94
00:06:52,064 --> 00:06:54,104
<i>His anger makes that clear</i>

95
00:06:54,176 --> 00:06:58,747
<i>Don't ask him for a favor</i>
<i>'cause his nastiness increases</i>

96
00:06:58,815 --> 00:07:01,271
<i>No crust of bread for those in need</i>

97
00:07:01,343 --> 00:07:04,093
<i>No cheeses for us "meeces"</i>

98
00:07:04,159 --> 00:07:05,817
Scrooge liked the cold.

99
00:07:05,887 --> 00:07:08,059
He was hard and sharp as a flint.

100
00:07:08,128 --> 00:07:09,884
Secret and self-contained.

101
00:07:09,952 --> 00:07:12,024
As solitary as an oyster.

102
00:07:12,095 --> 00:07:14,299
<i>There goes Mr. Heartless</i>

103
00:07:14,367 --> 00:07:16,472
<i>There goes Mr. Cruel</i>

104
00:07:16,543 --> 00:07:18,998
<i>He never gives</i>
<i>He only takes</i>

105
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:21,176
<i>He lets his hunger rule</i>

106
00:07:21,247 --> 00:07:25,852
<i>If being mean's a way of life</i>
<i>you practice and rehearse</i>

107
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,287
<i>Then all that work is paying off</i>

108
00:07:28,351 --> 00:07:30,904
<i>'Cause Scrooge is getting worse</i>

109
00:07:30,975 --> 00:07:35,448
<i>Every day, in every way</i>
<i>Scrooge is getting worse</i>

110
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,197
- [male] Oh, boy.
- How the time flies.

111
00:07:38,271 --> 00:07:40,126
Look at this, I've got to move...

112
00:07:40,191 --> 00:07:41,784
[horse brays]

113
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,148
Humbug.

114
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:54,715
Phew! What an unpleasant fellow.

115
00:07:54,783 --> 00:07:59,966
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scroo...

116
00:08:00,031 --> 00:08:02,398
Boy, this really is a dirty city.

117
00:08:02,463 --> 00:08:04,732
Ha. You tellin' me.

118
00:08:05,535 --> 00:08:08,284
[Thud, squeaking]

119
00:08:08,352 --> 00:08:10,872
Thank you for making me
a part of this.

120
00:08:10,943 --> 00:08:14,718
He was a tightfisted hand
at the grindstone, Scrooge.

121
00:08:14,783 --> 00:08:18,711
A squeezing, wrenching,
grasping, clutching...

122
00:08:18,783 --> 00:08:20,987
covetous old sinner.

123
00:08:21,055 --> 00:08:22,844
[Gulps]

124
00:08:22,912 --> 00:08:24,505
Bob Cratchit?

125
00:08:24,576 --> 00:08:25,721
Yes, Mr. Scrooge?

126
00:08:25,792 --> 00:08:27,450
Who is this?

127
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,079
Mr. Applegate, sir.

128
00:08:29,151 --> 00:08:31,672
He's here to speak to you
about his... mortgage.

129
00:08:31,744 --> 00:08:33,980
Mr. Scrooge,
I know you're very angry about this,

130
00:08:34,047 --> 00:08:36,469
and I didn't mean to
fall behind in the payment.

131
00:08:36,544 --> 00:08:38,813
Lord knows,
it being Christmas and all.

132
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,887
Please don't shout at me, sir.

133
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,861
That and, of course, little Gwen.
Her lungs aren't right.

134
00:08:43,935 --> 00:08:46,106
The doctor takes his share, don't he?

135
00:08:46,175 --> 00:08:48,182
You can yell and scream,
and you're right,

136
00:08:48,255 --> 00:08:49,946
but it won't do no good...

137
00:08:50,015 --> 00:08:52,568
because I'm the stone
you can't squeeze blood from.

138
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:54,810
And that's the truth!

139
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,083
[Applegate]
Thank you for not shouting at me.

140
00:08:57,151 --> 00:08:59,901
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 42...

141
00:08:59,967 --> 00:09:03,284
Let us deal with the eviction notices
for tomorrow, Mr. Cratchit.

142
00:09:03,359 --> 00:09:05,115
Uh...

143
00:09:05,183 --> 00:09:06,590
Tomorrow's Christmas, sir.

144
00:09:06,656 --> 00:09:10,300
Very well, you may gift wrap them.

145
00:09:10,367 --> 00:09:12,756
[Worker] Let us help you with that,
Mr. Cratchit.

146
00:09:12,832 --> 00:09:15,003
My, there are certainly a lot today.

147
00:09:15,071 --> 00:09:16,020
We'll get it.

148
00:09:16,095 --> 00:09:18,234
I'm okay, okay.

149
00:09:18,303 --> 00:09:20,158
- Here you go.
- Look out on that end...

150
00:09:20,223 --> 00:09:22,165
[clamoring]

151
00:09:22,239 --> 00:09:24,094
- Uh...
- [workers] Whoa!

152
00:09:25,439 --> 00:09:28,439
Christmas is a very busy time for us,
Mr. Cratchit.

153
00:09:28,511 --> 00:09:31,610
People preparing feasts, giving parties.

154
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,062
Spending the mortgage money
on frivolities.

155
00:09:35,135 --> 00:09:38,681
One might say that December
is the foreclosure season.

156
00:09:38,752 --> 00:09:42,974
Harvest time for the moneylenders.

157
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:44,501
- Boss, ask him.
- Tell him.

158
00:09:44,575 --> 00:09:47,674
- Come on. Come on.
- Do it now. Do it.

159
00:09:47,744 --> 00:09:50,493
If you please, Mr. Scrooge,
it's gotten colder.

160
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:54,138
The bookkeeping staff would like to have
an extra shovel of coal for the fire.

161
00:09:54,208 --> 00:09:57,110
- We can't do the bookkeeping.
- Our pens are like ink-cicles.

162
00:09:57,183 --> 00:09:58,939
Our assets are frozen.

163
00:09:59,008 --> 00:10:02,652
How would the bookkeepers
like to be suddenly unemployed?

164
00:10:02,719 --> 00:10:04,475
[All] Heat wave!

165
00:10:04,543 --> 00:10:07,860
[All sing]
This is my island in the sun!

166
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:11,132
I, I believe you've convinced them
once again, Mr. Scrooge.

167
00:10:14,207 --> 00:10:16,891
At that moment,
who should arrive at the door

168
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,887
but Scrooge's nephew, Fred.
His only living relative.

169
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:23,348
- Nephew Fred? I don't see him.
- Trust me.

170
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:26,839
Hello? Uncle?

171
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,908
Rizzo?

172
00:10:29,984 --> 00:10:32,318
You're very good at that, Mr. Dickens.

173
00:10:32,383 --> 00:10:35,514
A merry Christmas, Uncle Scrooge.
God save you.

174
00:10:35,583 --> 00:10:37,110
Merry Christmas?

175
00:10:37,183 --> 00:10:39,354
Bah. Humbug!

176
00:10:39,423 --> 00:10:41,333
Quick, it'll be warmer in there.

177
00:10:45,344 --> 00:10:48,857
Christmas a humbug, Uncle?
You don't mean that, surely.

178
00:10:48,928 --> 00:10:50,870
Actually, I think it's colder in here.

179
00:10:50,943 --> 00:10:53,726
Merry Christmas, you say?
What right have you to be merry?

180
00:10:53,791 --> 00:10:55,220
You're poor enough.

181
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:57,368
And you to be dismal?
You're rich enough.

182
00:10:57,439 --> 00:10:59,511
He's got him.
The old boy's speechless.

183
00:10:59,583 --> 00:11:01,558
If I could work my will,

184
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,664
every idiot who goes about with
"Merry Christmas" on his lips

185
00:11:04,735 --> 00:11:06,491
would be cooked with his own turkey

186
00:11:06,559 --> 00:11:09,494
and buried with a stake of holly
through his heart.

187
00:11:09,567 --> 00:11:11,323
Well, not quite speechless.

188
00:11:11,391 --> 00:11:12,820
- Uncle...
- Nephew.

189
00:11:12,895 --> 00:11:16,604
You keep Christmas in your own way,
and let me keep it in mine.

190
00:11:16,672 --> 00:11:20,446
Christmas is a loving,
honest and charitable time.

191
00:11:20,512 --> 00:11:23,894
And though it's never put
a scrap of gold or silver in my pocket,

192
00:11:23,967 --> 00:11:26,585
I believe Christmas has done me good
and will do me good,

193
00:11:26,655 --> 00:11:28,248
and I say, God bless it.

194
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:30,042
[Workers cheer]

195
00:11:30,112 --> 00:11:33,789
And how does one celebrate Christmas
on the unemployment line?

196
00:11:35,967 --> 00:11:38,815
Now, in these times,
it was customary on Christmas Eve

197
00:11:38,879 --> 00:11:41,465
for well-meaning gentlemen
to call upon businesses,

198
00:11:41,535 --> 00:11:45,080
collecting donations
for the poor and homeless.

199
00:11:45,727 --> 00:11:47,669
Mr. Scrooge, I presume?

200
00:11:47,744 --> 00:11:49,118
[High-pitched squeak]

201
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:51,224
Who are you?

202
00:11:51,295 --> 00:11:54,840
We're from the Order of Victoria
Charity Foundation.

203
00:11:54,911 --> 00:11:57,595
We'd like to speak to you
about a donation.

204
00:11:57,663 --> 00:11:59,518
Ah! Welcome!

205
00:11:59,583 --> 00:12:02,071
This jolly old gentleman here
is Mr. Scrooge.

206
00:12:02,144 --> 00:12:04,413
He's very generous to charities.

207
00:12:04,479 --> 00:12:05,940
My dear nephew!

208
00:12:06,015 --> 00:12:08,950
At this festive season of the year,
Mr. Scrooge,

209
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:13,147
many of us feel we must
take care of our poor and homeless.

210
00:12:13,215 --> 00:12:15,670
Are there no prisons?
No poor houses?

211
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:17,914
Oh, plenty of those, sir.

212
00:12:17,983 --> 00:12:19,576
Oh. Excellent.

213
00:12:19,647 --> 00:12:21,370
For a moment, I was worried.

214
00:12:21,439 --> 00:12:25,531
Some of us are endeavoring to raise
a fund for the poor and homeless.

215
00:12:25,599 --> 00:12:27,900
What might I put you down for?

216
00:12:27,967 --> 00:12:28,949
Nothing.

217
00:12:29,023 --> 00:12:32,918
- You wish to remain anonymous?
- I wish to be left alone.

218
00:12:32,991 --> 00:12:34,966
I do not make merry myself
for Christmas.

219
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,087
That certainly is true.

220
00:12:36,223 --> 00:12:38,110
I cannot afford
to make idle people merry.

221
00:12:38,175 --> 00:12:39,669
That is certainly not true.

222
00:12:39,743 --> 00:12:42,263
Don't you have other things to do
this afternoon?

223
00:12:42,335 --> 00:12:45,651
Sadly, I do, Uncle.
So I shall make my donation.

224
00:12:45,727 --> 00:12:48,247
And leave you to make yours.

225
00:12:48,319 --> 00:12:49,978
Thank you so very much.

226
00:12:50,047 --> 00:12:54,040
Oh, Uncle, come and have Christmas
dinner with me and Clara tomorrow.

227
00:12:54,111 --> 00:12:55,867
Why ever did you get married?

228
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,877
Why? Because I fell in love.

229
00:12:57,951 --> 00:12:59,893
[Laughs]

230
00:12:59,967 --> 00:13:03,098
That's the only thing in the world
sillier than a merry Christmas.

231
00:13:03,167 --> 00:13:05,917
It's no use, I shall keep
my Christmas humor to the last.

232
00:13:05,983 --> 00:13:09,278
A merry Christmas to you.
And a happy New Year.

233
00:13:09,343 --> 00:13:11,645
- Merry Christmas, Fred.
- Merry Christmas, Bob.

234
00:13:11,711 --> 00:13:12,988
Humbug!

235
00:13:14,175 --> 00:13:15,866
[Softly] Ahem.

236
00:13:15,935 --> 00:13:18,237
[Clock ticks]

237
00:13:23,999 --> 00:13:26,650
Now, then, sir, about the...

238
00:13:26,719 --> 00:13:28,345
donation.

239
00:13:29,023 --> 00:13:30,812
Well, now.

240
00:13:30,879 --> 00:13:32,537
Let's see.

241
00:13:33,727 --> 00:13:36,596
I know how to treat the poor.

242
00:13:36,671 --> 00:13:39,967
My taxes go to pay for the prisons
and the poorhouses.

243
00:13:40,031 --> 00:13:42,682
- The homeless must go there.
- But some would rather die.

244
00:13:42,751 --> 00:13:45,238
If they'd rather die,
then they'd better do it,

245
00:13:45,311 --> 00:13:47,221
and decrease the surplus population.

246
00:13:47,295 --> 00:13:49,848
- [Squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

247
00:13:49,919 --> 00:13:53,662
This is the door, you may use it.

248
00:13:53,727 --> 00:13:55,516
All right, Beaker, come along.

249
00:13:55,583 --> 00:13:59,357
I think we've taken enough
of Mr. Scrooge's time.

250
00:13:59,423 --> 00:14:02,205
- [Beaker squeaks]
- Oh, dear. Dear, dear.

251
00:14:02,271 --> 00:14:05,784
- [Door slams]
- [Workers] 17... 24... 58.

- What do you want?
- Uh... Penny for the song, guvnor?

258
00:14:26,783 --> 00:14:28,027
[Gasps]

259
00:14:28,543 --> 00:14:30,004
Wh... Ow!

260
00:14:30,719 --> 00:14:31,799
[Groans]

00:14:32,959 --> 00:14:34,585
[Worker] 17... 24...

262
00:14:47,647 --> 00:14:52,633
[clears throat] Excuse me, Mr. Scrooge,
but it appears to be closing time.

263
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:57,752
Very well. I'll see you
at eight tomorrow morning.

264
00:14:58,975 --> 00:15:00,252
[Workers] Ask him, ask him.

265
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,042
Um... Tomorrow's Christmas.

266
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:04,315
- 8:30, then.
- [Workers sigh]

267
00:15:04,383 --> 00:15:05,725
If you please, sir,

268
00:15:05,791 --> 00:15:08,573
half an hour off hardly seems customary
for Christmas Day.

269
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:11,454
- [Worker] No.
- [Worker 2] Hardly customary.

270
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:14,170
How much time off is customary,
Mr. Cratchit?

271
00:15:14,239 --> 00:15:17,687
Um... Why, um, the, er, whole day.

272
00:15:17,759 --> 00:15:19,547
- Yeah, that's right.
- The whole day.

273
00:15:19,615 --> 00:15:20,924
The entire day?

274
00:15:20,991 --> 00:15:22,933
- No.
- That's the frog's idea.

275
00:15:23,007 --> 00:15:25,974
If you please,
why open the office tomorrow?

276
00:15:26,047 --> 00:15:29,396
Other businesses will be closed.
You'll have no one to do business with.

277
00:15:29,471 --> 00:15:32,787
It'll waste a lot of expensive coal
for the fire.

278
00:15:32,863 --> 00:15:35,896
- That's definitely a point.
- That's a point.

279
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:39,545
It's a poor excuse for picking
a man's pocket every December the 25th.

280
00:15:39,614 --> 00:15:42,200
[All groan]

281
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:45,370
But as I seem to be
the only person around who knows that...

282
00:15:46,623 --> 00:15:49,209
...take the day off.
- [All cheer]

283
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,674
- Will you stop that?
- [Workers yelp]

284
00:15:57,023 --> 00:15:58,932
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

285
00:16:00,575 --> 00:16:02,463
Be here all the earlier
the next morning.

286
00:16:02,527 --> 00:16:05,047
- [Worker] Okay.
- [Worker 2] You bet. First thing.

287
00:16:08,223 --> 00:16:10,295
With their employer gone at last,

288
00:16:10,367 --> 00:16:12,887
Bob Cratchit and the bookkeepers
immediately began

289
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,596
that most pleasant of activities,
the celebration of Christmas.

290
00:16:17,662 --> 00:16:20,510
- He's gone!
- [Workers cheer]

291

<i>Today, the world has got a glow</i>

That's it. Ha! Ha!

307
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,188
- [Others cheer]
- Mm-hm.

308
00:17:37,151 --> 00:17:39,223
Very good, gentlemen.

- Look at that!

You did good, boss.

318
00:18:30,623 --> 00:18:33,525
Oh, thank you.
Thank you very much.

319
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:39,742
Wow!

320
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:41,945
- No way.
- Come on, Rizzo.

00:18:51,103 --> 00:18:52,347

[Dog barks]

335
00:19:44,574 --> 00:19:47,193
Scrooge lived in chambers
which had once belonged

336
00:19:47,263 --> 00:19:50,230
to his old business partners,
Jacob and Robert Marley.

337
00:19:50,303 --> 00:19:52,245
- Have some bread?
- Not while I'm working.

338
00:19:52,319 --> 00:19:54,206
Suit yourself.

339
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:58,067
The building was a dismal heap of brick
on a dark street.

340
00:19:58,143 --> 00:20:01,274
Once again, you must remember
that the Marleys were dead

341
00:20:01,342 --> 00:20:03,993
- and decaying in their graves.
- Yeuch!

342
00:20:04,063 --> 00:20:06,202
[Whispers] That one thing
you must remember,

343
00:20:06,271 --> 00:20:08,605
or nothing that follows
will seem wondrous.

344
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,132
Why are you whispering?

345
00:20:10,207 --> 00:20:12,312
- It's for dramatic emphasis.
- Oh.

346
00:20:12,383 --> 00:20:13,757
Shh.

347
00:20:36,670 --> 00:20:37,947
Jacob Marley?

348
00:20:38,015 --> 00:20:40,120
[Booming groan]

349
00:20:43,326 --> 00:20:44,788
You okay?

350
00:20:55,391 --> 00:20:56,667
Humbug.

351
00:20:59,550 --> 00:21:01,917
Oh. Gonzo, speak to me.

352
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:05,659
I mean, Mr. Dickens.
Charlie! Are you hurt?

353
00:21:05,726 --> 00:21:08,760
To say that Scrooge
was not startled would be untrue.

354
00:21:08,831 --> 00:21:12,126
Still, the moment had passed,
and the world was as it should be.

355
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:14,646
He ain't hurt.
Didn't even break his concentration.

356
00:21:14,718 --> 00:21:16,376
- Hmm?
- Nothing.

357
00:21:20,926 --> 00:21:23,544
Come on, Rizzo.
We'll follow him in.

358
00:21:23,614 --> 00:21:27,062
In a minute.
I had a bag of jelly beans over here.

359
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:28,792
Will you just get over here?

360
00:21:28,862 --> 00:21:30,935
- All right.
- Sheesh.

361
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:34,359
- [Dickens groans]
- Oh-oh.

362
00:21:36,030 --> 00:21:37,110
Steady, steady.

363
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:39,550
[Strangulated]
Scrooge made his way up the stairs,

364
00:21:39,614 --> 00:21:41,524
caring not a button for the darkness.

365
00:21:41,598 --> 00:21:44,053
Darkness was cheap,
and Scrooge liked it.

366
00:21:46,142 --> 00:21:49,720
<i>But the incident at the door</i>
<i>had made Scrooge wary.</i>

367
00:21:49,791 --> 00:21:53,947
<i>Before he shut himself in for the night,</i>
<i>he searched his rooms.</i>

368
00:21:54,014 --> 00:21:56,348
<i>- [Rizzo] Okay, that does it.</i>
<i>- [Dickens] Pardon?</i>

369
00:21:56,415 --> 00:21:58,586
How do you know
what Scrooge is doing?

370
00:21:58,655 --> 00:22:00,760
We're down here and he's up there.

371
00:22:00,831 --> 00:22:04,443
I keep telling you, storytellers
are omniscient. I know everything.

372
00:22:04,511 --> 00:22:07,293
Hoity-toity, Mr. Godlike Smarty-Pants.

373
00:22:09,567 --> 00:22:13,364
To conduct a proper search,
Scrooge was forced to light the lamps.

374
00:22:15,038 --> 00:22:16,696
How does he do that?

375
00:22:48,606 --> 00:22:50,101
Agh!

376
00:22:57,790 --> 00:22:59,034
Oh.

377
00:23:00,126 --> 00:23:02,363
It's my best dressing gown.

378
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:07,606
No harm done.

Look, it's Ebenezer Scrooge.

387
00:24:20,639 --> 00:24:23,257
Looking older and more wicked
than ever.

388
00:24:23,326 --> 00:24:25,301

Who are you?

391
00:24:31,070 --> 00:24:32,958
In life, we were your partners,

392
00:24:33,022 --> 00:24:36,153
- Jacob...
- And Robert Marley.

393
00:24:36,222 --> 00:24:38,262
It looks like you.

394
00:24:38,334 --> 00:24:42,109
- But I don't believe it.
- Why do you doubt your senses?

395
00:24:42,174 --> 00:24:45,174
Because a little thing
can affect them.

396
00:24:45,246 --> 00:24:48,595
A slight disorder of the stomach
can make them cheat.

397
00:24:48,671 --> 00:24:52,380
You may be a bit of undigested beef.
A blob of mustard.

398
00:24:52,446 --> 00:24:54,170
A crumb of cheese.

399
00:24:54,239 --> 00:24:57,719
Yes, there's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

401
00:25:00,287 --> 00:25:02,326
More of gravy than of grave?

402
00:25:02,398 --> 00:25:05,300
What a terrible pun.
Where do you get those jokes?

403
00:25:05,374 --> 00:25:07,447
Leave comedy to the bears, Ebenezer.

404
00:25:09,406 --> 00:25:13,203
Please, Jacob, Robert,
don't criticize me.

405
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:14,969
You always criticized me.

406
00:25:15,038 --> 00:25:16,794
We were always heckling you.

407
00:25:16,863 --> 00:25:18,717
It's good to be heckling again.

408
00:25:18,783 --> 00:25:20,855
It's good to be doing anything again.

409
00:25:22,814 --> 00:25:24,440
Why do you come to me?

<i>And if you could not pay the rent,</i>
<i>we simply threw you out</i>

414
00:25:43,647 --> 00:25:46,549
There was the year
we evicted the entire orphanage.

415
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:50,649
I remember the little tykes
all standing in the snowbank.

416
00:25:50,719 --> 00:25:53,435
With their little
frostbitten teddy bears.

But my friends, you were not unfeeling
towards your fellow men.

00:26:27,230 --> 00:26:30,361
True, there was something
about mankind we loved.

428
00:26:30,431 --> 00:26:32,121
I think it was their money.

- [Both wail]
- The chains.

437
00:26:57,950 --> 00:27:01,812
We forged these chains in life
by our acts of greed.

leaving him once again
alone in his room.

00:31:57,150 --> 00:31:59,353
[Spirit] It is the past.

523
00:32:02,366 --> 00:32:04,886
Look, it's beautiful, Rizzo.

524
00:32:04,958 --> 00:32:07,162
[Rizzo] Mommy!

525
00:32:14,014 --> 00:32:15,924
Hey, we're going down.

526
00:32:16,510 --> 00:32:18,844
Hang on, Rizzo.

527
00:32:18,910 --> 00:32:21,496
- [Woman screams]
- [Dickens] Sorry, madam.

528
00:32:21,566 --> 00:32:23,421
- [Man grunts]
- [Rizzo] Pardon me, sir.

529
00:32:23,486 --> 00:32:25,242
[Dickens] Look out, Rizzo.

530
00:32:28,221 --> 00:32:30,229
Rizzo, this is Louise.

531
00:32:30,302 --> 00:32:32,211
Yeah, we've met.

532
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:45,430
And so they arrived
in Ebenezer Scrooge's childhood.

533
00:32:45,501 --> 00:32:47,803
That was the worst trip of my life.

534
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:49,179
It's over now.

535
00:32:49,246 --> 00:32:52,180
- Yeah, safe at last.
- [Meows]

536
00:32:52,990 --> 00:32:53,938
No.

537
00:32:54,622 --> 00:32:56,989
No. No! Oh, no!

538
00:32:57,054 --> 00:32:58,396
Nice kitty, nice kitty.

539
00:32:58,462 --> 00:33:00,404
Ow! I'm from New Jersey.

540
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:02,103
[Cat meows, kids shout]

541
00:33:03,102 --> 00:33:05,491
It was the afternoon of Christmas Eve,

542
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:08,729
and Scrooge was conscious
of a thousand odors.

543
00:33:08,797 --> 00:33:13,686
Each one connected with a thousand
thoughts, hopes, joys and cares,

544
00:33:13,758 --> 00:33:15,830
long, long forgotten.

545
00:33:17,918 --> 00:33:19,827
It's my old school.

546
00:33:20,734 --> 00:33:22,294
I was a boy here.

547
00:33:23,262 --> 00:33:25,782
That's Henry.

548
00:33:25,854 --> 00:33:28,025
And Edmund, my best friend.

549
00:33:28,094 --> 00:33:30,614
Hello, boys. Hello.

550
00:33:30,686 --> 00:33:33,336
These are but shadows
of your past, Ebenezer.

551
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:35,926
They can neither see nor hear you.

552
00:33:35,998 --> 00:33:38,234
Come, let us go inside.

553
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:42,420
Rizzo, stop playing with the cat.

554
00:33:42,493 --> 00:33:45,079
- Save me, save me!
- [Cat meows viciously]

555
00:34:02,909 --> 00:34:06,204
And what a flood of memories
came back to him,

556
00:34:06,270 --> 00:34:09,270
as Scrooge beheld his old classroom.

557
00:34:10,270 --> 00:34:12,310
I know it all so well, spirit.

558
00:34:13,246 --> 00:34:14,904
The desks.

559
00:34:16,062 --> 00:34:18,036
The smell of the chalk.

560
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:22,455
I chose my profession in this room.

561
00:34:22,526 --> 00:34:25,144
And is he, too, familiar?

562
00:34:27,998 --> 00:34:31,511
[Dickens] Scrooge beheld a small boy,
a boy he knew,

563
00:34:31,582 --> 00:34:33,949
oh, very well indeed.

564
00:34:36,766 --> 00:34:39,253
Good heavens.

565
00:34:39,326 --> 00:34:40,820
It's me.

566
00:34:40,894 --> 00:34:43,228
Come Ebenezer,
the last coach is leaving.

567
00:34:43,294 --> 00:34:45,497
Come on,
he never goes home for Christmas.

568
00:34:45,566 --> 00:34:47,802
Who cares about stupid old Christmas?

569
00:34:49,693 --> 00:34:51,766
I was often alone.

570
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:56,406
More time for reading... and study.

571
00:34:56,478 --> 00:35:00,252
The Christmas holiday was a chance
to get some extra work done.

572
00:35:01,342 --> 00:35:03,993
A time for... solitude.

573
00:35:07,006 --> 00:35:09,275
Rats don't understand these things.

574
00:35:09,342 --> 00:35:11,382
You were never a lonely child?

575
00:35:11,454 --> 00:35:14,749
I had 1,274 brothers and sisters.

576
00:35:14,813 --> 00:35:18,643
Sheesh.
Rats don't understand these things.

577
00:35:18,718 --> 00:35:22,100
Let us see another Christmas
in this place.

578
00:35:22,174 --> 00:35:24,246
They were all very much the same.

579
00:35:26,589 --> 00:35:28,280
Nothing ever changed.

580
00:35:28,349 --> 00:35:30,357
You changed.

581
00:35:50,302 --> 00:35:52,887
[Dickens] The years performed
their terrible dance.

582
00:35:52,957 --> 00:35:56,951
And in a moment, Scrooge had seen
his entire childhood pass.

583
00:35:57,022 --> 00:36:01,015
He saw his old school room
age and decay.

584
00:36:01,085 --> 00:36:02,841
What the... Hey!

585
00:36:02,909 --> 00:36:03,858
Agh!

586
00:36:03,933 --> 00:36:07,643
So, Master Scrooge, graduation day!

587
00:36:08,702 --> 00:36:11,735
That's my old headmaster.

588
00:36:11,805 --> 00:36:13,911
This man taught me my greatest lesson.

589
00:36:13,981 --> 00:36:17,298
Stand up. Build your life
as this school was built.

590
00:36:17,374 --> 00:36:18,388
Push!

591
00:36:18,462 --> 00:36:20,371
[Strains] My ear, my ear, my ear.

592
00:36:22,302 --> 00:36:27,190
Yes, work hard, work long,
and be constructive.

593
00:36:27,261 --> 00:36:30,076
Ebenezer, life is a golden opportunity.

594
00:36:30,141 --> 00:36:32,956
Today you go forth into the real world.

595
00:36:33,021 --> 00:36:35,803
You must keep your nose
to the grindstone.

596
00:36:35,870 --> 00:36:38,041
Work hard, lad. And one day,

597
00:36:38,110 --> 00:36:40,979
your life will be as solid
as this very building.

598
00:36:42,846 --> 00:36:45,301
Hmm. I've been meaning
to fix that shelf.

599
00:36:45,374 --> 00:36:46,551
Yes, headmaster.

600
00:36:46,621 --> 00:36:51,477
Young man, you have been apprenticed
to a fine company in London.

601
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:55,347
Today, you become a man of business.

602
00:36:55,422 --> 00:36:57,331
I'm looking forward to it, headmaster.

603
00:36:57,406 --> 00:36:59,740
You will love business.

604
00:36:59,805 --> 00:37:01,976
It is the American way.

605
00:37:02,046 --> 00:37:02,994
Sam?

606
00:37:03,070 --> 00:37:05,437
- Mmm?
- [Whispers]

607
00:37:06,365 --> 00:37:08,918
Oh. It is the British way.

608
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:09,938
Good.

609
00:37:10,013 --> 00:37:11,802
Yes, headmaster.

610
00:37:15,581 --> 00:37:17,818
[Headmaster]
Oh, here is your coach, Ebenezer.

611
00:37:17,885 --> 00:37:21,082
Come, Scrooge, there is much to see.

612
00:37:22,718 --> 00:37:24,627
Remember, don't tip the driver.

613
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:36,790
A moment later, Scrooge found himself
standing on a city street,

614
00:37:36,861 --> 00:37:40,790
looking at a building
he had not seen in years.

615
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:43,895
Tell me, Ebenezer Scrooge,
do you know this place?

616
00:37:43,965 --> 00:37:47,314
Know it? My first job was here.

617
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:49,943
This is Fozziwig's
old rubber chicken factory.

618
00:37:50,014 --> 00:37:51,737
Once again, it was Christmas Eve,

619
00:37:51,805 --> 00:37:56,661
night was falling, and the lamplighters
were plying their trade.

620
00:37:56,734 --> 00:38:00,050
Hey, light the lamp, not the rat.
Light the lamp, not the rat!

621
00:38:00,125 --> 00:38:01,816
- My apologies.
- What are you doing?

622
00:38:01,886 --> 00:38:04,025
Put me out, put me out!

623
00:38:04,094 --> 00:38:06,428
- Rizzo!
- What?

624
00:38:06,493 --> 00:38:08,315
[Screams]

625
00:38:08,381 --> 00:38:09,658
[Gurgling]

626
00:38:09,725 --> 00:38:12,791
[Shivers]
Oh, oh, Th-th-th-thank you.

627
00:38:12,861 --> 00:38:14,519
You're welcome.

628
00:38:16,798 --> 00:38:19,416
There he is, old Fozziwig himself.

629
00:38:19,485 --> 00:38:22,998
Look my lads, dusk has fallen,
and the lamplighters are at work.

630
00:38:23,069 --> 00:38:25,208
It's Christmas Eve for certain.

631
00:38:25,278 --> 00:38:27,165
What an employer he was.

632
00:38:27,229 --> 00:38:30,458
As hard and as ruthless
as a rose petal.

633
00:38:30,526 --> 00:38:32,697
It's time for the party to begin.

634
00:38:32,765 --> 00:38:35,285
It's the Fozziwig Christmas party.

635
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:36,983
Rizzo, come on.

636
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:40,089
Rizzo, just grab hold of the stick.

637
00:38:40,157 --> 00:38:42,329
Merry Christmas.

638
00:38:42,398 --> 00:38:44,307
Thank you, thank you.

639
00:38:45,726 --> 00:38:48,409
Excuse me, everyone.
Can we have some quiet, please?

640
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:50,420
[Clucking]

641
00:38:51,229 --> 00:38:52,440
Whoa!

642
00:38:58,397 --> 00:39:00,983
I suppose I should be grateful for that.

643
00:39:01,054 --> 00:39:02,842
You're welcome.

644
00:39:02,910 --> 00:39:05,976
Everyone, please,
can I have your attention for a moment?

645
00:39:06,046 --> 00:39:06,994
[They laugh]

646
00:39:07,070 --> 00:39:10,169
Look, it's the Marley brothers.

647
00:39:10,237 --> 00:39:12,277
My old partners, as they were as lads.

648
00:39:12,350 --> 00:39:14,619
Can I have your attention, please?

649
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:16,147
[Chatter continues]

650
00:39:18,174 --> 00:39:19,962
Quiet!

651
00:39:21,950 --> 00:39:23,259
Thank you.

652
00:39:23,326 --> 00:39:24,886
That's better.

653
00:39:24,958 --> 00:39:28,122
Welcome to Fozziwig and Mom's
annual Christmas party.

654
00:39:28,190 --> 00:39:29,978
At this time in the proceedings,

655
00:39:30,046 --> 00:39:32,763
it is a tradition
for me to make a little speech.

656
00:39:32,830 --> 00:39:35,448
And it's a tradition for us
to take a little nap.

657
00:39:35,518 --> 00:39:37,689
[They laugh]

658
00:39:37,757 --> 00:39:39,797
Uh, pay no attention to them.

659
00:39:39,869 --> 00:39:42,771
My speech,
here is my Christmas speech.

660
00:39:42,845 --> 00:39:46,260
"Thank you all
and merry Christmas."

661
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:48,340
- That was the speech?
- That was dumb.

662
00:39:48,413 --> 00:39:50,071
- It was obvious.
- It was pointless.

663
00:39:50,141 --> 00:39:52,214
It was short.

664
00:39:52,286 --> 00:39:54,707
[Both] I loved it! [both laugh]

665
00:39:54,781 --> 00:39:58,872
I'm bored with speeches.
Let's dance, Son!

666
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,308
Here's Mrs. Fozziwig to start the party.

667
00:40:01,374 --> 00:40:03,795
- Way to go, Ma!
- Hit it, boys!

668
00:40:03,869 --> 00:40:05,462
[Grunts]

669
00:40:07,613 --> 00:40:08,693
Hello.

670
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:12,888
Look, there's a buffet over here.
I'm kind of hungry.

671
00:40:12,958 --> 00:40:16,307
[Sings nonsensically to <i>Deck The Halls]</i>

672
00:40:16,381 --> 00:40:20,757
<i>Fa-la la-la la</i>
<i>La-la la la</i>

673
00:40:20,829 --> 00:40:24,604
Forget it. Mother always taught me,
never eat singing food.

674
00:40:26,877 --> 00:40:29,212
[Fozziwig] A pleasure having you here.

675
00:40:29,278 --> 00:40:31,766
I'm very pleased,
and please enjoy yourself.

676
00:40:31,838 --> 00:40:34,259
Excuse me, Mr. Fozziwig?

677
00:40:34,333 --> 00:40:36,308
Sir, I've been going over the accounts.

678
00:40:36,381 --> 00:40:39,284
Do you know how much the firm
is spending for this party?

679
00:40:39,357 --> 00:40:42,521
Master Scrooge, this is Christmas.

680
00:40:42,589 --> 00:40:44,597
It's a time for generosity.

681
00:40:44,670 --> 00:40:49,939
Stop working, enjoy yourself.
Go meet some people, go ahead.

682
00:40:50,013 --> 00:40:51,093
Hello.

683
00:40:53,149 --> 00:40:55,538
[Pounding]

684
00:40:55,613 --> 00:40:57,522
[Growling, rapid pounding]

685
00:40:59,838 --> 00:41:01,561
[Band strikes up]

686
00:41:04,638 --> 00:41:06,492
You dancing fool!

687
00:41:13,470 --> 00:41:15,771
I love these annual Christmas parties.

688
00:41:15,837 --> 00:41:18,172
I love them so much,
I think we'll do it twice a year.

689
00:41:18,238 --> 00:41:19,482
Excuse me.

690
00:41:19,550 --> 00:41:22,233
- [Fozziwig] Master Scrooge.
- Excuse me.

691
00:41:22,301 --> 00:41:25,236
Belle, I'd like to introduce you
to Ebenezer Scrooge,

692
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,611
the finest young financial mind
in the city.

693
00:41:27,678 --> 00:41:29,979
Ebenezer, this is Belle,

694
00:41:30,046 --> 00:41:31,955
a friend of the Fozziwig family.

695
00:41:32,030 --> 00:41:33,939
I'm pleased to meet you.

696
00:41:35,421 --> 00:41:38,519
Well, I'm glad you two finally met.

697
00:41:38,589 --> 00:41:40,859
[Spirit] Do you remember this meeting?

698
00:41:42,141 --> 00:41:43,799
Remember?

699
00:41:45,822 --> 00:41:46,770
Yes.

700
00:41:47,549 --> 00:41:49,491
I remember.

701
00:41:49,565 --> 00:41:53,460
There was, of course, another
Christmas Eve with this young woman,

702
00:41:53,533 --> 00:41:55,770
some years later.

703
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:59,863
Oh, please,
do not show me that Christmas.

704
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:15,315
[Birdsong]

705
00:42:19,965 --> 00:42:22,518
Another year
before our wedding, Ebenezer.

706
00:42:22,589 --> 00:42:24,564
It can't be helped, Belle.

707
00:42:25,693 --> 00:42:29,654
How could we marry now? There's
not even enough for a decent home.

708
00:42:29,725 --> 00:42:31,897
The investments haven't grown
as they should.

709
00:42:31,965 --> 00:42:33,874
So you said last year.

710
00:42:34,430 --> 00:42:36,535
Business continues to be poor.

711
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:40,726
You're a partner in your own firm now.

712
00:42:42,333 --> 00:42:44,057
Barely clearing expenses.

713
00:42:44,125 --> 00:42:47,387
- You said the partnership was the goal.
- This is for you.

714
00:42:48,701 --> 00:42:51,090
I love you, Belle.

715
00:42:52,670 --> 00:42:54,873
You did, once.

716
00:43:00,445 --> 00:43:01,874
[Sobs]

717
00:43:02,685 --> 00:43:04,343
Oh, Rizzo.

718
00:43:08,797 --> 00:43:10,684
Spirit, show me no more.

719
00:43:11,614 --> 00:43:13,883
Why do you delight in torturing me?

720
00:43:13,949 --> 00:43:18,291
I told you, these are the shadows
of the things that have been.

721
00:43:18,365 --> 00:43:21,911
That they are what they are,
do not blame me.

722
00:43:21,981 --> 00:43:23,890
Leave me.

723
00:43:44,317 --> 00:43:48,408
Scrooge was left alone and exhausted
in his bedchamber.

724
00:43:48,477 --> 00:43:53,234
And thus he remained, until the
nearby clock began to strike the hour.

725
00:43:53,885 --> 00:43:55,259
[Grunts] Oh.

726
00:43:55,325 --> 00:43:58,227
- Oh. Oh, what was that?
- Two o'clock.

727
00:43:58,301 --> 00:44:00,636
- Is it too early for breakfast?
- Yes.

728
00:44:00,701 --> 00:44:03,035
Oh, good, supper time.

729
00:44:03,102 --> 00:44:04,531
[Ding]

730
00:44:06,365 --> 00:44:07,772
[Ding]

731
00:44:07,837 --> 00:44:11,634
[Dickens] Scrooge knew
the second of the ghosts was due.

732
00:44:11,709 --> 00:44:14,808
Yet now,
as the clock finished striking...

733
00:44:16,317 --> 00:44:17,779
Nothing.

734
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,502
[Laughing]

735
00:44:20,573 --> 00:44:23,388
Come in, and know me better, man.

736
00:44:37,405 --> 00:44:40,024
Come in, and know me better, man.

737
00:44:40,093 --> 00:44:42,776
- Did I already say that?
- You did.

738
00:44:42,845 --> 00:44:45,528
I am the Ghost of Christmas Present.

739
00:44:45,598 --> 00:44:49,820
This is the night before the dawn
before the day of Christmas.

740
00:44:49,885 --> 00:44:53,660
Did I tell you that I am
the Ghost of Christmas Present?

741
00:44:53,725 --> 00:44:58,297
- You did.
- Come in, know me better, man.

742
00:44:58,365 --> 00:45:00,438
You're a little absent-minded, spirit.

743
00:45:00,509 --> 00:45:04,764
No, I'm a large
absent-minded spirit. [chuckles]

744
00:45:06,045 --> 00:45:08,860
My mind is filled
with the here and now.

745
00:45:08,925 --> 00:45:12,602
And the now is Christmas. [laughs]

746
00:45:12,669 --> 00:45:16,248
[Scrooge laughs] I don't believe I've
ever met anybody like you before, sir.

747
00:45:16,318 --> 00:45:20,474
Really? Over 1,800 of my brothers
have come before me.

748
00:45:20,541 --> 00:45:23,738
1,800? Lmagine the grocery bills.

749
00:45:23,805 --> 00:45:25,714
[Both laugh]

750
00:45:28,989 --> 00:45:33,113
Have you ever noticed that everything
seems wonderful at Christmas?

751
00:45:34,621 --> 00:45:39,225
Uh, in all honesty, spirit, no.

752
00:45:40,637 --> 00:45:43,452
Perhaps I've never understood
about Christmas.

753
00:45:43,517 --> 00:45:47,379
Before this day is done,
you will understand.

754
00:45:47,453 --> 00:45:49,340
Oh. [laughs]

755
00:45:49,405 --> 00:45:51,162
Oh, no! Oh, no!

756
00:45:53,437 --> 00:45:56,568
We shall go out into the world.

757
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:01,626
I suppose you enjoyed that?

758
00:46:01,693 --> 00:46:03,154
Of course.

759
00:46:08,029 --> 00:46:12,404
May I welcome you
to Christmas morning?

760
00:46:12,477 --> 00:46:14,135
[Laughs]

761
00:46:14,781 --> 00:46:16,275
[They sing]

762
00:46:21,597 --> 00:46:24,412
<i>It's in the singing</i>

763
00:46:24,478 --> 00:46:26,965
<i>It's going home</i>

766
00:46:32,541 --> 00:46:35,127
<i>A cup of kindness</i>

767
00:46:35,197 --> 00:46:37,815
<i>A sweet reunion</i>

00:47:13,213 --> 00:47:15,896
<i>A pair of mittens</i>

<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

797
00:48:28,924 --> 00:48:33,147
It feels like Christmas!

798
00:48:34,749 --> 00:48:41,241
<i>It feels like Christmas</i>

799
00:48:44,221 --> 00:48:45,847
Spirit, I had no idea.

800
00:48:45,917 --> 00:48:49,779
I wish to see friends, kin.
Show me family.

801
00:48:51,869 --> 00:48:55,665
It's Fred. My dear nephew Fred
and his wife, Clara.

802
00:48:55,741 --> 00:48:57,596
Having Christmas with friends.

803
00:48:58,589 --> 00:49:00,017
Hey, look. Fruit.

804
00:49:00,093 --> 00:49:03,060
Well, now, we've had the plum pudding
and sung the carols.

805
00:49:03,132 --> 00:49:05,042
- What now, my lovelies?
- A game, Fred.

806
00:49:05,117 --> 00:49:07,189
Yeah, we must have a game at Christmas.

807
00:49:07,261 --> 00:49:10,610
- Do people play games at Christmas?
- I love games.

808
00:49:10,685 --> 00:49:13,238
Say, do you know that fruit is wax?

809
00:49:13,309 --> 00:49:16,604
Oh, yeah,
I wondered about the texture. Yeuch!

810
00:49:16,669 --> 00:49:19,669
- Let's play "Yes and No."
- Oh, wonderful game.

811
00:49:19,741 --> 00:49:22,676
Yah! That's a great game. I'll be it.

812
00:49:22,749 --> 00:49:25,399
Yes, let Fred be it.
He always thinks of good things.

813
00:49:25,468 --> 00:49:27,770
I do have a good one, Clara. Guess.

814
00:49:27,837 --> 00:49:29,747
Is it vegetable?

815
00:49:29,821 --> 00:49:31,282
- [Fred] No.
- [Clara] Mineral?

816
00:49:31,357 --> 00:49:32,699
- No.
- Animal, then?

817
00:49:32,765 --> 00:49:34,587
- What else?
- What else, indeed.

818
00:49:34,653 --> 00:49:36,792
- Is it found on a farm?
- Never.

819
00:49:36,861 --> 00:49:38,486
- In the city?
- Usually.

820
00:49:38,557 --> 00:49:40,695
Does it pull a hansom cab?

821
00:49:40,765 --> 00:49:42,227
Certainly not.

822
00:49:42,301 --> 00:49:43,959
How about a dog?

823
00:49:44,029 --> 00:49:44,977
No.

824
00:49:45,053 --> 00:49:46,133
- A cat?
- A cat?

825
00:49:46,205 --> 00:49:49,402
- I said it first.
- No.

826
00:49:49,468 --> 00:49:51,923
Wait, is this an unwanted creature?

827
00:49:51,996 --> 00:49:54,101
- Often.
- A mouse?

828
00:49:54,172 --> 00:49:55,350
- No.
- A rat?

829
00:49:55,421 --> 00:49:57,428
- You called?
- A cockroach.

830
00:49:57,500 --> 00:49:58,449
No.

831
00:49:58,525 --> 00:49:59,986
- A leech?
- It's too wonderful.

832
00:50:00,061 --> 00:50:02,931
Wait, I know.
An unwanted creature,

833
00:50:03,004 --> 00:50:05,371
but not a rat, a leech,
or a cockroach?

834
00:50:05,436 --> 00:50:06,451
Then what?

835
00:50:06,525 --> 00:50:08,762
- What?
- It's Ebenezer Scrooge.

836
00:50:08,829 --> 00:50:09,777
Yes.

837
00:50:09,853 --> 00:50:12,024
- [All laugh]
- Wonderful.

838
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:15,639
[Female friend] That's a killer.

839
00:50:22,589 --> 00:50:25,436
Come, there is much to see.

840
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:28,348
No more. I wish to see no more.

841
00:50:32,989 --> 00:50:34,876
Here.

842
00:50:34,940 --> 00:50:37,144
Why have we come
to this odd corner of the town?

843
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,765
It's Christmas here, too, you know.

844
00:50:39,837 --> 00:50:42,423
That's Bob Cratchit's house.

845
00:50:42,493 --> 00:50:45,111
Perhaps it was the spirit's
own generous nature,

846
00:50:45,181 --> 00:50:47,221
and his sympathy for all poor men,

847
00:50:47,293 --> 00:50:51,384
that led them straight to the home
of Scrooge's faithful clerk.

848
00:50:53,245 --> 00:50:55,830
Goose. They're cooking goose down there.

849
00:50:55,901 --> 00:50:57,276
[Sniffs]

850
00:50:57,341 --> 00:50:59,861
Rizzo, get out of the way.

851
00:50:59,933 --> 00:51:02,038
Hey, don't be sweeping
the chimney now.

852
00:51:02,109 --> 00:51:04,051
You're blocking the smell. [sniffs]

853
00:51:05,212 --> 00:51:08,474
- This is Bob Cratchit's house?
- How do you know that?

854
00:51:08,540 --> 00:51:10,547
You just told me.

855
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,468
Hmm. Well, I'm usually trustworthy.

856
00:51:13,533 --> 00:51:14,962
[Chuckles]

857
00:51:15,037 --> 00:51:17,492
[Woman sings inside]

858
00:51:17,565 --> 00:51:20,412
- Who's that?
- Mrs. Cratchit, of course.

859
00:51:20,605 --> 00:51:22,427
[Sings to herself]

860
00:51:23,485 --> 00:51:24,979
[Sniffs] Ahh!

861
00:51:27,388 --> 00:51:30,323
Peter, do not stop turning that spit.

862
00:51:30,397 --> 00:51:33,463
That is the whole secret
of a properly roasted goose.

863
00:51:33,533 --> 00:51:37,756
- It smells so good, Mother.
- It does, doesn't it?

864
00:51:37,821 --> 00:51:40,952
[Sniffs] Oh. That smells wonderful.

865
00:51:42,013 --> 00:51:43,387
Oh, good grief.

866
00:51:43,452 --> 00:51:45,492
Hey, I'm stuck, get me out of here.

867
00:51:45,565 --> 00:51:47,605
I knew you weren't suited
for literature.

868
00:51:48,765 --> 00:51:50,193
[Rizzo screams]

869
00:51:51,709 --> 00:51:54,043
Oh, at least I landed
on something soft.

870
00:51:54,109 --> 00:51:56,084
And hot! Ooh! Ooh! Ooh!

871
00:51:56,157 --> 00:51:58,360
Hot, hot, hot!

872
00:51:59,164 --> 00:52:01,237
Mother, Mother, Mother!

873
00:52:01,309 --> 00:52:06,197
You said we couldn't eat the chestnuts
until Father and Tiny Tim get home.

874
00:52:06,269 --> 00:52:08,276
I wasn't eating them,

875
00:52:08,349 --> 00:52:11,797
I was merely checking them
to see if they were not burnt.

876
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:14,716
It's a chef's thing, dear.
And do not shout, Betina.

877
00:52:14,780 --> 00:52:17,683
- I'm Belinda.
- I'm Betina.

878
00:52:17,757 --> 00:52:20,026
Of course you are, Betina.

879
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:21,554
Belinda.

880
00:52:22,653 --> 00:52:24,311
Whatever.

881
00:52:25,565 --> 00:52:27,899
- [Faint singing]
- Huh?

882
00:52:27,964 --> 00:52:29,720
[Bebop-style singing]

883
00:52:32,220 --> 00:52:33,169
[Cratchit scats]

884
00:52:33,245 --> 00:52:37,522
<i>'Tis the season</i>
<i>to be jolly and joyous, fa la la</i>

885
00:52:37,597 --> 00:52:42,485
<i>With a burst of pleasure</i>
<i>we feel it arrive, fa la la</i>

886
00:52:42,557 --> 00:52:47,161
<i>It's a season when the saints</i>
<i>can employ us, fa la la</i>

887
00:52:47,228 --> 00:52:50,709
<i>To spread the news about</i>
<i>peace and to keep love alive</i>

888
00:52:54,973 --> 00:52:56,217
Come on, son.

889
00:52:56,285 --> 00:52:58,619
Let's go see if Christmas dinner
is ready yet.

890
00:52:58,684 --> 00:53:00,692
- Oh, yeah.
- Yes.

891
00:53:04,573 --> 00:53:06,777
Merry Christmas, everyone.

892
00:53:06,845 --> 00:53:07,924
Daddy!

893
00:53:11,068 --> 00:53:12,345
Merry Christmas, girls.

894
00:53:12,413 --> 00:53:14,518
- Merry Christmas, Peter.
- Merry Christmas.

895
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:17,142
Children, children,
it's time to set the table.

896
00:53:17,213 --> 00:53:19,930
- Go ahead.
- Wait for me.

897
00:53:19,997 --> 00:53:23,292
- Merry Christmas, Emily.
- Merry Christmas...

898
00:53:23,356 --> 00:53:24,633
Crachy.

899
00:53:25,372 --> 00:53:26,321
Emmy.

900
00:53:30,524 --> 00:53:34,648
I fell down the chimney
and landed on a flaming hot goose.

901
00:53:34,716 --> 00:53:37,433
You have all the fun.

902
00:53:37,500 --> 00:53:39,443
What?

903
00:53:39,516 --> 00:53:42,037
Peter, the Christmas dinner.

904
00:53:42,109 --> 00:53:43,963
The goose, the goose.

905
00:53:44,028 --> 00:53:45,817
[Laughs, coughs]

906
00:53:47,292 --> 00:53:51,002
Oh, no, now, son,
you've gotten too excited.

907
00:53:51,069 --> 00:53:55,128
You go sit in your chair a moment.
Rest a moment.

908
00:53:55,197 --> 00:53:58,874
- How was he at church?
- As good as gold and better.

909
00:53:58,941 --> 00:54:01,013
He said he hoped the people
saw him in church

910
00:54:01,084 --> 00:54:04,467
because it might be pleasant for them
to remember upon Christmas Day

911
00:54:04,540 --> 00:54:08,469
who made lame beggars walk
and blind men see.

912
00:54:08,540 --> 00:54:10,450
A remarkable child.

913
00:54:11,869 --> 00:54:14,651
[Dickens] With that,
the Cratchits came to what was surely

914
00:54:14,717 --> 00:54:18,645
the happiest single moment
in all the livelong year.

915
00:54:18,717 --> 00:54:22,361
- Such a meager feast.
- But very much appreciated.

916
00:54:24,157 --> 00:54:26,328
I pay Bob such a small amount.

917
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:28,786
- Mr. Scrooge.
- Bob.

918
00:54:28,861 --> 00:54:30,868
Bob Cratchit?

919
00:54:30,941 --> 00:54:33,788
It only seems right that
I should lift a glass to my employer.

920
00:54:33,852 --> 00:54:36,536
I give you Mr. Scrooge,
the founder of the feast.

921
00:54:36,604 --> 00:54:39,735
The founder of the feast, indeed. Huh!

922
00:54:39,804 --> 00:54:43,514
If I had him here, I would give him
a piece of my mind to feast upon.

923
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:45,435
And I bet he would choke on it.

924
00:54:45,500 --> 00:54:47,867
- Choke!
- My dear, the children.

925
00:54:47,932 --> 00:54:49,110
Christmas Day.

926
00:54:49,181 --> 00:54:53,458
Well, I suppose that
on the blessed day of Christmas,

927
00:54:53,532 --> 00:54:57,012
one must drink to the health
of Mr. Scrooge,

928
00:54:57,084 --> 00:55:00,216
even though he is odious,
stingy, wicked,

929
00:55:00,285 --> 00:55:03,929
and unfeeling, and badly dressed...

930
00:55:03,996 --> 00:55:07,313
To the founder of the feast,
Mr. Scrooge.

931
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:13,401
To Mr. Scrooge, he'll be very merry
and happy this day, I have no doubt.

932
00:55:13,469 --> 00:55:14,417
No doubt.

933
00:55:14,493 --> 00:55:15,737
Mm. Cheers.

934
00:55:17,213 --> 00:55:20,922
God bless us, every one.

935
00:55:23,037 --> 00:55:25,884
<i>Life is full of sweet surprises</i>

936
00:55:25,949 --> 00:55:28,152

<i>Fills me up with song</i>

941
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:44,728
<i>And know that I belong</i>

<i>Bless us all</i>

943
00:55:47,421 --> 00:55:50,071
<i>Who gather here</i>

00:55:50,141 --> 00:55:55,410
<i>The loving family I hold dear</i>

00:55:55,484 --> 00:55:58,070
<i>No place on Earth</i>

946
00:55:58,141 --> 00:56:00,792

<i>And every path will bring me</i>

948

<i>That as we live</i>

00:56:11,389 --> 00:56:16,986
<i>We always comfort and forgive</i>

951
00:56:17,052 --> 00:56:19,223
<i>We have so much</i>

952
00:56:19,292 --> 00:56:22,074
<i>That we can share</i>

953
00:56:22,141 --> 00:56:27,159
<i>With those in need</i>

00:56:27,228 --> 00:56:31,385
<i>Let us always love each other</i>

955
00:56:32,636 --> 00:56:35,768
<i>Lead us to the light</i>

00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:43,354
<i>Let us hear the voice of reason</i>

<i>Singing in the night</i>

958
00:56:48,636 --> 00:56:51,931
<i>Let us run from anger</i>

959
00:56:53,821 --> 00:56:57,683
<i>And catch us when we fall</i>

960
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:04,406
<i>Teach us in our dreams</i>
<i>And please, yes, please,</i>

961
00:57:04,477 --> 00:57:07,673
<i>Bless us, one and all</i>

00:57:10,972 --> 00:57:13,077
<i>Bless us all</i>

<i>We reach for you</i>

966
00:57:23,804 --> 00:57:26,651
<i>And we stand tall</i>

00:57:26,717 --> 00:57:32,052
<i>And in our prayers and dreams</i>
<i>We ask you, bless us all</i>

00:57:32,125 --> 00:57:34,678

00:57:42,781 --> 00:57:46,642

972
00:57:46,716 --> 00:57:48,505
[coughs]

973
00:57:52,668 --> 00:57:55,985
[Emmy] Let's all take our seats now.
Let's have dinner.

974
00:57:56,060 --> 00:58:00,054
Spirit, tell me if Tiny Tim will live.

975
00:58:00,124 --> 00:58:02,099
That is the future.

976
00:58:02,172 --> 00:58:04,082
My realm is the present.

977
00:58:04,157 --> 00:58:09,307
However, I see a vacant seat
by the chimney corner.

978
00:58:09,372 --> 00:58:11,609
And a crutch without an owner.

979
00:58:11,676 --> 00:58:16,946
If these shadows remain unaltered,
I believe the child will die.

980
00:58:17,020 --> 00:58:20,337
But then, if he's going to die,
he'd better do it,

981
00:58:20,412 --> 00:58:23,544
and decrease the surplus population.

982
00:58:23,613 --> 00:58:24,954
Oh, spirit.

983
00:58:25,020 --> 00:58:28,020
[Dickens] As the Cratchit family
vanished into the darkness,

984
00:58:28,092 --> 00:58:32,183
Scrooge kept his eyes upon Tiny Tim,
until the last.

985
00:58:32,253 --> 00:58:35,668
Come. My time grows short.

986
00:58:35,741 --> 00:58:37,650
[Wind whistles]

987
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:44,123
Spirit, do you grow old?

988
00:58:44,188 --> 00:58:46,643
I do. [chuckles]

989
00:58:48,796 --> 00:58:50,967
Are spirits' lives so short?

990
00:58:51,036 --> 00:58:53,906
My time upon this globe is very brief.

991
00:58:53,981 --> 00:58:59,960
I believe it will end
upon the stroke of 12.

992
00:59:00,028 --> 00:59:01,817
- [Ding]
- [Rizzo] One.

993
00:59:01,884 --> 00:59:06,456
Now? But spirit,
I have learned so much from you.

994
00:59:06,557 --> 00:59:09,240
Nothing Scrooge could do or say
could stop

995
00:59:09,308 --> 00:59:12,374
the relentless march
of those terrible bells.

996
00:59:12,444 --> 00:59:14,353
[Rizzo] Five!

997
00:59:14,428 --> 00:59:16,665
Oh, spirit, do not leave me.

998
00:59:16,732 --> 00:59:19,415
I think I must, in fact.

999
00:59:19,516 --> 00:59:22,451
You have meant so much to me.
You have changed me.

1000
00:59:22,556 --> 00:59:27,674
And now I leave you with
the Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come.

1001
00:59:27,740 --> 00:59:31,002
- You mean, the future?
- Mm.

1002
00:59:31,069 --> 00:59:32,083
Must I?

1003
00:59:32,156 --> 00:59:37,688
Go forth, and know him better, man.
[Laughs]

1004
01:00:18,396 --> 01:00:22,258
Am I in the presence of the
Ghost of Christmas Yet To Come?

1005
01:00:25,948 --> 01:00:32,112
Spirit, I fear you more
than any specter I have yet met.

1006
01:00:33,469 --> 01:00:36,502
This is too scary.
I don't think I want to see any more.

1007
01:00:36,572 --> 01:00:39,703
When you're right, you're right.
You're on your own, folks.

1008
01:00:39,772 --> 01:00:43,449
- We'll meet you at the finale.
- Yeah.

1009
01:00:44,284 --> 01:00:48,823
I am prepared to follow and to learn,
with a thankful heart.

1010
01:00:52,028 --> 01:00:54,395
Will you not speak to me?

1011
01:00:58,525 --> 01:01:02,419
Oh, yes, the night is waning fast.

1012
01:01:02,492 --> 01:01:04,402
Lead on, spirit.

1013
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:29,398
No, I don't know much about it,
either way.

1014
01:01:29,468 --> 01:01:32,053
I only know he's dead.

1015
01:01:32,124 --> 01:01:35,158
- When?
- Last night, I believe.

1016
01:01:35,228 --> 01:01:38,392
Wonder what he died of.
I thought he'd never go.

1017
01:01:38,460 --> 01:01:39,769
[All laugh]

1018
01:01:39,836 --> 01:01:41,941
I don't know or care why he's gone.

1019
01:01:42,012 --> 01:01:44,347
I'd just like to know
what he's done with his money.

1020
01:01:44,412 --> 01:01:45,873
Wouldn't we all?

1021
01:01:45,948 --> 01:01:47,639
He didn't give it to me.

1022
01:01:48,956 --> 01:01:51,444
It's likely to be a cheap funeral.

1023
01:01:51,516 --> 01:01:54,233
I don't know a single soul
who would go to it.

1024
01:01:54,300 --> 01:01:56,537
- I wouldn't mind going.
- Eh?

1025
01:01:56,604 --> 01:01:58,743
If lunch is provided.

1026
01:01:58,812 --> 01:02:00,851
[All snort and laugh]

1027
01:02:00,924 --> 01:02:03,161
- Speaking of lunch...
- Oh, yes.

1028
01:02:06,364 --> 01:02:09,047
I know some of those gentlemen, spirit.

1029
01:02:09,117 --> 01:02:12,019
Of what poor wretch do they speak?

1030
01:02:26,844 --> 01:02:30,706
So, back from the house of sadness,
I see.

1031
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,163
Sad that he didn't die years ago,
the old skinflint.

1032
01:02:34,236 --> 01:02:36,276
- Hear, hear.
- Let me see.

1033
01:02:36,349 --> 01:02:38,552
What have you got for old Joe?

1034
01:02:38,620 --> 01:02:42,265
What have you got for me
to remember him by?

1035
01:02:42,332 --> 01:02:44,055
Joe, get off.

1036
01:02:44,124 --> 01:02:47,954
Well, I got these collar buttons
from his dresser.

1037
01:02:48,988 --> 01:02:51,126
Mother of pearl.

1038
01:02:51,196 --> 01:02:53,847
No, I got his bed curtains.

1039
01:02:53,916 --> 01:02:56,851
Very fine damask. [laughs]

1040
01:02:56,924 --> 01:03:00,568
Very cheap damask.
But worth a few coins.

1041
01:03:00,636 --> 01:03:02,775
I've got his blankets.

1042
01:03:02,844 --> 01:03:08,146
His blankets?
Why, Mrs. Dilber, they're still warm.

1043
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:11,668
I don't pay extra for the warmth,
you know.

1044
01:03:11,740 --> 01:03:14,642
You should.
It's the only warmth he ever had.

1045
01:03:14,716 --> 01:03:16,243
[All laugh]

1046
01:03:21,724 --> 01:03:23,284
I understand, spirit.

1047
01:03:23,356 --> 01:03:26,585
The case of this unhappy man
might be my own.

1048
01:03:26,652 --> 01:03:29,205
My life turns that way now.

1049
01:03:29,276 --> 01:03:31,185
Merciful heavens.

1050
01:03:32,124 --> 01:03:35,507
Let me see some tenderness
connected with this world,

1051
01:03:35,580 --> 01:03:38,809
or I'll be haunted
by that terrible conversation forever.

1052
01:03:46,108 --> 01:03:48,825
It's Bob Cratchit's house.

1053
01:03:48,892 --> 01:03:51,226
Oh, yes, spirit.

1054
01:03:51,292 --> 01:03:53,201
A place of joy and laughter.

1055
01:03:54,109 --> 01:03:56,530
Thank you for bringing me here.

1056
01:04:01,852 --> 01:04:04,056
It's so quiet.

1057
01:04:06,332 --> 01:04:08,601
Why is it so quiet, spirit?

1058
01:04:20,444 --> 01:04:22,266
[Sniffing]

1059
01:04:24,956 --> 01:04:26,712
Mother, you're crying again.

1060
01:04:26,780 --> 01:04:30,075
It's just the lamplight,
that hurts my eyes.

1061
01:04:34,428 --> 01:04:36,338
Not Tiny Tim?

1062
01:04:37,756 --> 01:04:41,979
There, now.
My eyes get weak in the dim light.

1063
01:04:42,044 --> 01:04:45,273
I would not want to show
weak eyes to your father,

1064
01:04:45,340 --> 01:04:47,511
when he gets home,
for anything in the world.

1065
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:50,297
He should be back now.

1066
01:04:50,364 --> 01:04:55,001
I think he's walked a little slower
these past two evenings.

1067
01:04:56,028 --> 01:04:58,068
Hello, my dears.

1068
01:04:58,140 --> 01:04:59,219
Daddy.

1069
01:05:01,563 --> 01:05:03,254
Hello, girls.

1070
01:05:03,324 --> 01:05:04,339
Hello, Peter.

1071
01:05:04,412 --> 01:05:07,608
Children, please go set the table.

1072
01:05:07,676 --> 01:05:09,465
Thank you.

1073
01:05:09,532 --> 01:05:11,059
How was the churchyard?

1074
01:05:11,132 --> 01:05:12,659
It will be lovely, Emily.

1075
01:05:12,731 --> 01:05:16,660
It would have done you good
to see how green the place is.

1076
01:05:16,732 --> 01:05:21,369
I picked a spot for Tim
where he can see...

1077
01:05:21,436 --> 01:05:24,152
It's, it's a spot on the hill.

1078
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:26,587
You can see the ducks on the river.

1079
01:05:26,652 --> 01:05:27,829
Tiny Tim...

1080
01:05:27,900 --> 01:05:31,544
Tiny Tim always loved
watching the ducks on the river.

1081
01:05:34,652 --> 01:05:39,770
Spirit, must there be a Christmas
that brings this awful scene?

1082
01:05:41,660 --> 01:05:43,569
How can we endure it?

1083
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,471
It's all right, children.

1084
01:05:49,628 --> 01:05:51,897
Life is made up
of meetings and partings.

1085
01:05:51,964 --> 01:05:53,720
That is the way of it.

1086
01:05:54,844 --> 01:05:57,844
I am sure we shall never forget
Tiny Tim.

1087
01:05:57,916 --> 01:06:00,599
Or this first parting
that there was among us.

1088
01:06:06,204 --> 01:06:08,277
[Quiet sniffing]

1089
01:06:35,676 --> 01:06:37,749
Must we return to this place?

1090
01:06:41,148 --> 01:06:43,220
There is something else
that I must know?

1091
01:06:43,292 --> 01:06:45,713
Is that not true?

1092
01:06:47,227 --> 01:06:50,457
Spirit, I know what I must ask.

1093
01:06:50,524 --> 01:06:52,858
I fear to, but I must.

1094
01:06:54,108 --> 01:06:55,701
Who was the wretched man

1095
01:06:55,772 --> 01:06:58,521
whose death brought
so much glee and happiness to others?

1096
01:07:11,036 --> 01:07:12,890
Answer me one more question.

1097
01:07:12,956 --> 01:07:15,323
Are these the shadows
of things that will be?

1098
01:07:15,388 --> 01:07:17,941
Or are they the shadows
of things that may be, only?

1099
01:07:27,035 --> 01:07:29,272
These events can be changed.

1100
01:07:41,116 --> 01:07:43,352
A life can be made right.

1101
01:08:03,388 --> 01:08:05,428
Ebenezer Scrooge.

1102
01:08:05,500 --> 01:08:08,217
Oh, please, spirit, no.

1103
01:08:08,284 --> 01:08:10,705
Hear me, I'm not the man I was.

1104
01:08:12,411 --> 01:08:15,608
Why would you show me this
if I was past all hope?

1105
01:08:17,211 --> 01:08:20,986
I will honor Christmas,
and try to keep it all the year.

1106
01:08:23,452 --> 01:08:27,674
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1107
01:08:27,740 --> 01:08:31,351
I will not shut out the lessons
the spirits have taught me.

1108
01:08:31,420 --> 01:08:34,616
Tell me that I may sponge out
the writing on this stone.

1109
01:08:37,211 --> 01:08:39,829
Spirit, please speak to me.

1110
01:08:43,612 --> 01:08:45,368
[Clock ticks]

1111
01:08:58,108 --> 01:08:59,701
I'm home.

1112
01:09:03,131 --> 01:09:05,073
[Dickens]
Yes, the bedposts were his own.

1113
01:09:05,148 --> 01:09:08,312
The bed was his own.
The room was his own.

1114
01:09:08,380 --> 01:09:10,519
Hi, guys, we're back.

1115
01:09:10,588 --> 01:09:12,475
We promised we would be.

1116
01:09:12,539 --> 01:09:14,928
But the thing that made Scrooge
happiest of all

1117
01:09:15,003 --> 01:09:16,912
was that his life lay before him.

1118
01:09:16,988 --> 01:09:18,995
And it could be changed.

1119
01:09:19,068 --> 01:09:22,363
I will live my life in the past,
the present, and the future.

1120
01:09:22,428 --> 01:09:24,850
Oh, Jacob and Robert Marley.

1121
01:09:24,924 --> 01:09:27,411
Heaven in the Christmas time
be praised for this day.

1122
01:09:27,483 --> 01:09:29,556
I say it on my knees,
Jacob and Robert.

1123
01:09:29,627 --> 01:09:30,838
On my knees.

1124
01:09:30,908 --> 01:09:34,290
Oh, they're not torn down.
They're here.

1125
01:09:34,363 --> 01:09:36,884
And I'm here. It's a miracle.

1126
01:09:41,787 --> 01:09:44,308
I don't know what to do.
I'm as light as a feather.

1127
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:47,576
I'm as happy as an angel,
I'm as merry as a schoolboy.

1128
01:09:47,643 --> 01:09:50,261
Do you think it's safe
for us to be up here?

1129
01:09:50,331 --> 01:09:52,273
Scrooge is saved,
what can happen now?

1130
01:09:52,347 --> 01:09:53,460
Yeah.

1131
01:09:57,052 --> 01:09:58,873
You there, boy.

1132
01:09:58,939 --> 01:10:00,401
What, me?

1133
01:10:01,404 --> 01:10:03,640
Uh, that is, "What, me, sir?"

1134
01:10:03,708 --> 01:10:05,945
- What's today?
- Pardon?

1135
01:10:06,012 --> 01:10:07,986
What's today, my fine fellow?

1136
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:10,645
Today? Today is Christmas Day.

1137
01:10:10,716 --> 01:10:12,178
It's Christmas Day?

1138
01:10:12,251 --> 01:10:15,350
I haven't missed it.
The spirits did it all in one night.

1139
01:10:15,420 --> 01:10:18,354
They can do anything they like.
Of course they can.

1140
01:10:18,428 --> 01:10:20,794
- Of course they can.
- Of course they can.

1141
01:10:20,859 --> 01:10:22,616
Know the poultry shop nearby?

1142
01:10:22,684 --> 01:10:24,953
- Yes, sir, I do.
- An intelligent lad.

1143
01:10:25,020 --> 01:10:27,409
A remarkable lad.

1144
01:10:27,484 --> 01:10:30,451
Do you know whether the prize turkey
has been sold in the window?

1145
01:10:30,524 --> 01:10:33,491
The one twice as big as me?
It's still there.

1146
01:10:33,564 --> 01:10:35,538
It's a pleasure talking with you, lad.

1147
01:10:35,612 --> 01:10:37,946
- Go and buy it.
- Be serious.

1148
01:10:38,012 --> 01:10:40,979
I am serious. Buy it for me
and I'll give you a shilling.

1149
01:10:41,051 --> 01:10:43,287
No, I'll give you five shillings.

1150
01:10:45,180 --> 01:10:46,358
Wow!

1151
01:10:46,428 --> 01:10:49,111
And so the boy was off like a shot.
So even...

1152
01:10:50,683 --> 01:10:52,407
Um... Sorry.

1153
01:10:53,531 --> 01:10:55,571
I'll bring it to Bob Cratchit's house.

1154
01:10:55,644 --> 01:10:59,353
What a surprise it'll be.
It's twice the size of Tiny Tim.

1155
01:10:59,419 --> 01:11:02,682
And a few moments later,
dressed in his finest,

1156
01:11:02,747 --> 01:11:05,203
Scrooge appeared
on the streets of the city

1157
01:11:05,275 --> 01:11:08,920
to wish Merry Christmas
to all the world.

1158
01:11:08,988 --> 01:11:10,995
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1159
01:11:11,067 --> 01:11:12,922
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

1160
01:11:12,987 --> 01:11:15,191
Merry Christmas.
Merry Christmas.

1161
01:11:16,988 --> 01:11:18,711
Gee, thanks.

1162
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:22,227
Everyone was out and about
this fine morning.

1163
01:11:22,299 --> 01:11:25,529
And soon he encountered
two familiar faces.

1164
01:11:25,596 --> 01:11:27,025
- [Yelps]
- [Gasps]

1165
01:11:27,100 --> 01:11:28,594
Mr. Scrooge.

1166
01:11:28,667 --> 01:11:31,155
Pardon me, gentlemen,
but about the charity donation

1167
01:11:31,227 --> 01:11:32,950
you asked me for yesterday?

1168
01:11:33,019 --> 01:11:34,514
Put me down for...

1169
01:11:36,764 --> 01:11:37,843
That much?

1170
01:11:37,915 --> 01:11:39,672
Not a penny less.

1171
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:42,609
A great many back payments
are included in it, I assure you.

1172
01:11:42,684 --> 01:11:45,401
My goodness,
I don't know what to say.

1173
01:11:45,468 --> 01:11:48,338
I just wish there was something
we could give you.

1174
01:11:53,436 --> 01:11:55,540
A gift?

1175
01:11:55,612 --> 01:11:57,619
A gift for me?

1176
01:12:04,923 --> 01:12:06,385
Thank you.

1177
01:12:07,067 --> 01:12:08,212
Thank you.

1178
01:12:08,284 --> 01:12:12,309
- 50 times! And a Merry Christmas.
- Here's your turkey, Mr. Scrooge.

1179
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,289
Follow me, lad.

1180
01:12:15,868 --> 01:12:18,257
<i>With a thankful heart,</i>
<i>with an endless joy</i>

1181
01:12:18,331 --> 01:12:20,698
<i>With a growing family</i>
<i>Every girl and boy</i>

1182
01:12:20,764 --> 01:12:23,130
<i>Will be nephew and niece to me</i>

1183
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:25,301
<i>Nephew and niece to me</i>

1184
01:12:25,371 --> 01:12:28,121
<i>Will bring love, hope,</i>
<i>and peace to me</i>

1185
01:12:28,187 --> 01:12:30,227
<i>Love, hope, and peace to me</i>

1186
01:12:30,299 --> 01:12:32,404
<i>Yes, and every night will end</i>

1187
01:12:32,475 --> 01:12:34,679
<i>And every day will start</i>

1188
01:12:34,747 --> 01:12:39,482
<i>With a grateful prayer</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1189
01:12:39,547 --> 01:12:41,936
<i>With an open smile</i>
<i>and with open doors</i>

1190
01:12:42,011 --> 01:12:44,346
<i>I will bid you welcome</i>
<i>What is mine is yours</i>

1191
01:12:44,412 --> 01:12:46,746
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1192
01:12:46,811 --> 01:12:49,232
<i>With a glass raised</i>
<i>to toast your health</i>

1193
01:12:49,308 --> 01:12:51,641
<i>And a promise to share the wealth</i>

1194
01:12:51,708 --> 01:12:53,879
<i>A promise to share the wealth</i>

1195
01:12:53,947 --> 01:12:56,019
<i>I will sail a friendly course</i>

1196
01:12:56,092 --> 01:12:58,295
<i>Follow a friendly chart</i>

1197
01:12:58,363 --> 01:13:02,520
<i>On a sea of love</i>
<i>and a thankful heart</i>

1198
01:13:02,587 --> 01:13:04,889
<i>Life is like a journey</i>

1199
01:13:06,971 --> 01:13:09,240
<i>Who knows when it ends?</i>

1200
01:13:12,507 --> 01:13:14,896
<i>Yes, and if you need to know</i>

1201
01:13:14,972 --> 01:13:17,306
<i>The measure of a man</i>

1202
01:13:17,372 --> 01:13:21,332
<i>You simply count his friends</i>

1203
01:13:21,404 --> 01:13:24,633
<i>Stop and look around you</i>

1204
01:13:25,755 --> 01:13:29,268
<i>The glory that you see</i>

1205
01:13:31,643 --> 01:13:36,182
<i>Is born again each day</i>
<i>Don't let it slip away</i>

1206
01:13:36,251 --> 01:13:39,929
<i>How precious life can be</i>

1207
01:14:24,091 --> 01:14:26,480
<i>With a thankful heart</i>
<i>that is wide awake</i>

1208
01:14:26,555 --> 01:14:28,857
<i>I do make this promise,</i>
<i>every breath I take</i>

1209
01:14:28,923 --> 01:14:31,541
<i>Will be used now to sing your praise</i>

1210
01:14:31,611 --> 01:14:33,716
<i>Used now to sing your praise</i>

1211
01:14:33,787 --> 01:14:36,242
<i>And to beg you to share my days</i>

1212
01:14:36,315 --> 01:14:38,519
<i>Beg you to share my days</i>

1213
01:14:38,587 --> 01:14:40,692
<i>With a loving guarantee</i>

1214
01:14:40,764 --> 01:14:43,032
<i>That even if we part</i>

1215
01:14:43,099 --> 01:14:46,482
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1216
01:14:47,804 --> 01:14:52,921
<i>I will hold you close</i>
<i>in a thankful heart</i>

1217
01:15:14,811 --> 01:15:16,818
Bob Cratchit?

1218
01:15:19,419 --> 01:15:20,728
So, here you are.

1219
01:15:20,795 --> 01:15:22,737
M-M-M-Mr. Scrooge.

1220
01:15:23,099 --> 01:15:26,165
You, sir, were not at work this morning
as we had discussed.

1221
01:15:26,235 --> 01:15:28,919
But, Mr. Scrooge, sir,
we did discuss it.

1222
01:15:28,988 --> 01:15:31,159
It's Christmas Day.
You gave me the day off.

1223
01:15:31,227 --> 01:15:32,274
I?

1224
01:15:32,347 --> 01:15:34,714
I, Ebenezer Scrooge?

1225
01:15:34,779 --> 01:15:36,568
- Would I do a thing like that?
- No.

1226
01:15:36,635 --> 01:15:38,326
I mean, yes, but you did.

1227
01:15:38,396 --> 01:15:40,283
Bob Cratchit, I've had my fill of this.

1228
01:15:40,348 --> 01:15:42,998
And I have had my fill of you,
Mr. Scrooge.

1229
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:44,561
And therefore, Bob Cratchit...

1230
01:15:44,635 --> 01:15:46,937
And therefore,
you can leave this house at once.

1231
01:15:47,003 --> 01:15:49,272
And therefore,
I'm about to raise your salary.

1232
01:15:49,339 --> 01:15:53,016
And I am about to raise you
right off the pavement...

1233
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,131
- Pardon?
- Pardon?

1234
01:15:54,204 --> 01:15:55,611
Yes, Bob.

1235
01:15:55,676 --> 01:15:57,269
Raise your salary.

1236
01:15:57,340 --> 01:16:00,154
And pay your mortgage
on this house.

1237
01:16:01,915 --> 01:16:03,737
Please, sir, come inside.

1238
01:16:03,804 --> 01:16:05,014
Yes, yes.

1239
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:08,280
Bob Cratchit, would you and your family
care to join us

1240
01:16:08,348 --> 01:16:11,828
for a little turkey dinner
on this fine Christmas Day?

1241
01:16:11,899 --> 01:16:13,808
Merry Christmas.

1242
01:16:23,516 --> 01:16:25,850
[Dickens] And Scrooge
was better than his word.

1243
01:16:25,915 --> 01:16:28,533
He did it all, and infinitely more.

1244
01:16:28,603 --> 01:16:30,426
And, er, Tiny Tim?

1245
01:16:30,491 --> 01:16:31,985
And Tiny Tim,

1246
01:16:32,059 --> 01:16:33,619
who did not die...

1247
01:16:33,691 --> 01:16:35,153
Isn't that swell?

1248
01:16:35,227 --> 01:16:38,359
To Tiny Tim,
Scrooge became a second father.

1249
01:16:38,427 --> 01:16:40,979
He became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1250
01:16:41,051 --> 01:16:44,662
and as good a man
as the good old city ever had.

1251
01:16:44,731 --> 01:16:47,666
It was always said of him that
he knew how to keep Christmas well,

1252
01:16:47,739 --> 01:16:50,008
if any man alive
possessed the knowledge.

1253
01:16:50,076 --> 01:16:54,134
May that truly be said of us
and all of us.

1254
01:16:54,203 --> 01:16:56,624
And so, as Tiny Tim observed...

1255
01:16:56,699 --> 01:16:59,547
- God bless us.
- God bless us.

1256
01:16:59,611 --> 01:17:01,269
Every one.

1257
01:17:02,811 --> 01:17:05,943
<i>The love we found</i>

1258
01:17:06,011 --> 01:17:09,426
<i>The love we found</i>

1259
01:17:09,499 --> 01:17:11,920
<i>We carry with us</i>

1260
01:17:11,995 --> 01:17:15,923
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1261
01:17:16,891 --> 01:17:20,339
<i>The love we found</i>

1262
01:17:20,411 --> 01:17:23,193
<i>The love we found</i>

1263
01:17:24,155 --> 01:17:26,741
<i>The sweetest dream</i>

1264
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:30,935
<i>That we have ever known</i>

1265
01:17:31,003 --> 01:17:33,786
Hey, say goodbye!

1266
01:17:34,939 --> 01:17:37,721
<i>The love we found</i>

1267
01:17:39,131 --> 01:17:41,040
Goodbye, goodbye.

1268
01:17:41,115 --> 01:17:45,370
<i>So we're never quite alone</i>

1269
01:17:46,267 --> 01:17:48,023
[Rizzo] Nice story, Mr. Dickens.

1270
01:17:48,091 --> 01:17:51,223
[Dickens] Thanks. If you like this,
you should read the book.

1285
01:18:35,546 --> 01:18:40,882
[Ghost of Christmas Present]
Oh, Yes! Make it last all year.

1286
01:18:40,954 --> 01:18:42,842
