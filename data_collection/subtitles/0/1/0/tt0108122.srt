1
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,715
<i>The time has come
to go to war again.</i>

2
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:16,303
<i>Not with Iraq, international terrorists,
or what was once Yugoslavia...</i>

3
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:18,138
<i>but with the medfly...</i>

4
00:02:18,222 --> 00:02:20,182
<i>a potentially devastating insect...</i>

5
00:02:20,224 --> 00:02:24,102
<i>that has chosen to make
California its new home.</i>

6
00:02:24,228 --> 00:02:29,399
<i>Despite assurances that spraying poses
no significant health risks to the public...</i>

7
00:02:29,441 --> 00:02:32,152
<i>the public is not convinced.</i>

8
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:35,239
<i>People sense they're being
kept in the dark purposely.</i>

9
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:38,242
<i>Furthermore, there is
no consensus...</i>

10
00:02:38,325 --> 00:02:41,411
<i>as to whether the objectives
are even realistic.</i>

11
00:02:41,912 --> 00:02:44,581
<i>Is this a war that can be won?</i>

12
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:46,416
<i>Some say no.</i>

13
00:02:46,542 --> 00:02:50,587
<i>Are we just going through the motions
so certain people can cover themselves?</i>

14
00:02:50,671 --> 00:02:53,257
<i>- Honey, it's on!
- Some say yes.</i>

15
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:56,218
<i>- Okay, I'm coming.
- How is this war fought?</i>

16
00:02:56,301 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>It's like fishing.
We use bait.</i>

17
00:02:59,596 --> 00:03:04,685
<i>Actually, the bait is spread over
our city at night, like a glaze.</i>

18
00:03:04,768 --> 00:03:06,270
<i>This is very discriminate bait...</i>

19
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:08,772
<i>- Do you have to wear your glasses on TV?
- like smart bombs...</i>

20
00:03:08,814 --> 00:03:11,608
<i>that destroy one thing,
but nothing else.</i>

21
00:03:11,692 --> 00:03:15,445
<i>The bait attracts the hungry,
newly hatched medflies...</i>

22
00:03:15,529 --> 00:03:17,531
<i>and poisons only them.</i>

23
00:03:18,448 --> 00:03:20,701
<i>The war's objective is clear.</i>

24
00:03:20,784 --> 00:03:25,247
<i>To destroy the medfly before
it has a chance to destroy us.</i>

25
00:03:53,734 --> 00:03:55,694
All right.

26
00:03:58,989 --> 00:04:01,366
Look over there.

27
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:05,162
Marian, what's so interesting?

28
00:04:05,245 --> 00:04:08,165
- Isn't that Alex Trebek?
- Alex Trebek? Where?

29
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:11,293
Over there, next to the woman
with the white hair.

30
00:04:11,376 --> 00:04:12,628
Is that Alex Trebek?

31
00:04:12,711 --> 00:04:15,088
Yes, I'm sure it is.

32
00:04:15,172 --> 00:04:16,715
Who's Alex Trebek?

33
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,425
Marian.

34
00:04:19,593 --> 00:04:20,677
Please.

35
00:04:58,382 --> 00:05:02,511
<i>...taken their time adopting a policy
of coexistence with the medfly...</i>

36
00:05:02,553 --> 00:05:05,681
<i>'cause that's the only
realistic course open to us.</i>

37
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:08,725
Oh, Andy, you're
a long ways away.

38
00:05:08,809 --> 00:05:12,646
I'm in L.A. Can you
hear the helicopters?

39
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:15,941
What are you wearing?

40
00:05:16,984 --> 00:05:19,903
Already?
That was fast.

41
00:05:30,372 --> 00:05:34,001
<i>If you're looking for a rainbow</i>

42
00:05:34,084 --> 00:05:37,629
<i>You know there's
gonna be some rain</i>

43
00:05:37,754 --> 00:05:41,508
<i>One minute you're
filled with happiness</i>

44
00:05:41,592 --> 00:05:44,553
<i>Next minute there's
nothing but pain</i>

45
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,597
<i>When you're a prisoner</i>

46
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,267
<i>And I'm a prisoner</i>

47
00:05:51,435 --> 00:05:53,896
<i>I'm a prisoner of life</i>

48
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,985
<i>One day your man is here</i>

49
00:06:00,110 --> 00:06:03,030
<i>The next day
he's walked out and gone</i>

50
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,742
<i>But no matter what happens</i>

51
00:06:06,867 --> 00:06:09,953
<i>You simply somehow
gotta carry on</i>

52
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:12,331
<i>When you're a prisoner</i>

53
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,959
<i>And I'm a prisoner</i>

54
00:06:17,002 --> 00:06:19,963
<i>I'm a prisoner of life</i>

55
00:06:22,049 --> 00:06:23,509
What are you doing here?

56
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,302
Just give me some coffee,
will you, babe?

57
00:06:25,385 --> 00:06:27,596
- Are you working, Earl?
- Yeah.

58
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:30,349
- You got somebody in the car?
- Yeah.

59
00:06:30,432 --> 00:06:33,393
- How come you got 'em here?
- They're passed out.

60
00:06:33,477 --> 00:06:35,729
It's one of those
drive-arounds.

61
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,190
You're not drinkin', are ya?

62
00:06:38,315 --> 00:06:40,984
Just give me
some coffee, baby.

63
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:45,322
I come all the way down here to see you.
I'd think you'd be happy to see me.

64
00:06:48,325 --> 00:06:50,118
<i>Life's good</i>

65
00:06:50,244 --> 00:06:51,912
<i>It's bad</i>

66
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:54,456
<i>It's somewhere in between</i>

67
00:06:54,831 --> 00:06:58,126
<i>But it's the unexpected
and the uncertainty</i>

68
00:06:58,210 --> 00:06:59,962
<i>That keeps us goin'</i>

69
00:07:00,045 --> 00:07:02,881
<i>You know what I mean</i>

70
00:07:03,006 --> 00:07:06,510
<i>Yesterday you owned the world</i>

71
00:07:06,635 --> 00:07:10,472
<i>The next day the world owns you</i>

72
00:07:10,556 --> 00:07:14,142
<i>One day everything's a lie</i>

73
00:07:14,268 --> 00:07:16,353
<i>The next day
you swear it's all true</i>

74
00:07:16,478 --> 00:07:19,147
<i>That's what happens

75
00:07:20,190 --> 00:07:22,818

76
00:07:23,819 --> 00:07:26,238
<i>I'm a prisoner of life</i>

77
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,325
You okay?

78
00:07:33,203 --> 00:07:36,790
<i>I told you I canceled
the Times, right?</i>

79
00:07:36,874 --> 00:07:38,041
Stopped the mail.

80
00:07:38,083 --> 00:07:41,920
All you have to do is come in and
check up on everything and feed the fish.

81
00:07:42,045 --> 00:07:45,674
I'll write... I got it all written down.
Didn't I put it on the, um, fridge?

82
00:07:45,757 --> 00:07:48,719
- Yeah, she wrote it down. I watched her.
- I got it written...

83
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:51,722
- Just come back tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

84
00:07:51,805 --> 00:07:54,516
- You are gonna...
- I... Your fish are gonna be fine.

85
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,727
What about the lionfish?
Feeding the lionfish?

86
00:07:56,852 --> 00:07:59,688
- That was just a joke, honey!
- No, no, no, no. No, no.

87
00:07:59,771 --> 00:08:02,983
- Lionfish like goldfish.
- That's what you wrote down.

88
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:06,820
- Yes. You feed them live goldfish.
- I thought you were joking.

89
00:08:06,904 --> 00:08:08,322
- No!
- You do that.

90
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:15,120
<i>Earthquakes, water shortages...</i>

91
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,122
<i>fires, mud slides...</i>

92
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:19,958
<i>Crime, gang warfare,
massive overcrowding.</i>

93
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,377
"His mother's name was
Speckled Hen. She looked..."

94
00:08:22,419 --> 00:08:26,757
<i>What will our lives be like if we
have to share space with the medfly?</i>

95
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:32,429
Gene! Gene, the helicopters
are here! Shut the windows!

96
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:35,849
Watch your brother. Okay?
Watch your brother.

97
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:39,770
Suzy! Come here,
my good little boy. Yes!

98
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,939
Sandy, shut the windows
for me, please.

99
00:08:43,106 --> 00:08:43,732
What are you doing?

100
00:08:43,774 --> 00:08:45,859
The dog stays outside.
I've told you a hundred times!

101
00:08:45,901 --> 00:08:49,238
Don't put Suzy outside. The spraying...
It's gonna give him cancer!

102
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:51,907
It's not gonna give it cancer!
Don't you get environmental on me, Sherri.

103
00:08:51,949 --> 00:08:54,451
Have you listened to
the news lately? It's dangerous!

104
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:56,870
They wouldn't be doing it
if it was dangerous!

105
00:08:56,912 --> 00:09:00,541
<i>Come on, kids!
It's all right! Come on outside!</i>

106
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:04,545
<i>It's all right!
It's safe! Come on!</i>

107
00:09:04,628 --> 00:09:08,173
Oh! Oh, yeah! Yeah, go on!
Get cancer!

108
00:09:10,133 --> 00:09:11,760
- Gene!
- Get the dog out!

109
00:09:11,844 --> 00:09:14,888
- Leave the dog alone!
- Stupid...

110
00:09:16,139 --> 00:09:19,560
The dog stays out.
The dog drives me out of my mind.

111
00:09:19,643 --> 00:09:21,520
- Where you going, Gene?
- Out of here.

112
00:09:21,603 --> 00:09:24,481
This is the third night
this week, Gene!

113
00:09:24,565 --> 00:09:26,942
Why don't you start
smoking again?

114
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,555
<i>How about Friday?</i>

115
00:09:56,638 --> 00:09:57,890
Are you free this weekend?

116
00:09:58,015 --> 00:10:02,060
I don't get back till Saturday, but if you
make it Sunday, I'll bring fresh trout.

117
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:08,025
Marian, why did you do that?

118
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,485
- What?
- Invite them to our house for supper?

119
00:10:10,569 --> 00:10:11,987
I didn't. You did.

120
00:10:12,070 --> 00:10:13,989
- No, I didn't.
- You said, "Let's set a date".

121
00:10:14,072 --> 00:10:16,783
No. I had to say "Let's set a date"
because you invited 'em to our house.

122
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:18,744
That was just
a comment, Ralph.

123
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:20,954
What's his name again?

124
00:10:21,038 --> 00:10:24,374
He's some kind of a doctor.
I think he's a dentist.

125
00:10:24,458 --> 00:10:25,751
Her name is Marian.

126
00:10:25,834 --> 00:10:28,128
- Marian, we don't even know them.
- Just relax.

127
00:10:28,212 --> 00:10:32,216
Okay? Just... relax.

128
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:35,511
Any of those medflies
get on you today?

129
00:10:36,011 --> 00:10:37,554
Ow! I got one.

130
00:10:37,638 --> 00:10:40,349
Do you want me to
describe myself for you?

131
00:10:40,432 --> 00:10:42,476
I'm a blonde...

132
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:45,562
36-24-34.

133
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,607
You don't do that.

134
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:53,237
<i>- What do you do?
- Oh, yeah?</i>

135
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,738
<i>These countries
ship their food...</i>

136
00:10:54,821 --> 00:10:57,824
Oh, yeah? But I'm not
gonna suck it yet.

137
00:10:57,908 --> 00:10:59,535
Come on. Let's go
play in your room.

138
00:11:00,577 --> 00:11:01,870
Come on.

139
00:11:01,954 --> 00:11:04,039
<i>What if all this is telling us...</i>

140
00:11:04,122 --> 00:11:07,209
<i>that every expert...
before every expert...</i>

141
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:10,254
Can you speak up, honey?
I can barely hear you.

142
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:14,424
Yeah, baby. Ooh.

143
00:11:14,508 --> 00:11:17,427
My panties are
getting a little wet.

144
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:21,682
Well, I'm on my bed, and
I'm on my hands and knees...

145
00:11:21,765 --> 00:11:25,894
and my mouth is
so close to your balls...

146
00:11:26,645 --> 00:11:28,480
Can you hear that?

147
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:30,524
Can you feel it?

148
00:11:30,607 --> 00:11:33,318
Don't you want me
to lick your balls first?

149
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:37,197
Mmm. Mmm.
You taste so good.

150
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:41,869
Ooh, your cock is
getting so big in my mouth.

151
00:11:41,952 --> 00:11:43,704
So big.

152
00:11:43,787 --> 00:11:46,582
Oh, yeah, baby,
I'm just gonna lick it...

153
00:11:46,707 --> 00:11:49,918
<i>Life's good, life's bad</i>

Honey, what's the matter?
Did you have a bad dream?

168
00:12:34,087 --> 00:12:37,257
Come on, sweetie.
Let's watch Daddy on TV.

169
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:41,178
- We'll all snuggle.
- What happened?

170
00:12:41,261 --> 00:12:44,973
- The helicopters scare you?
- I thought it was an earthquake.

171
00:12:45,057 --> 00:12:46,892
<i>- This is Howard Finnigan...
- He was just frightened.</i>

172
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,645
<i>With thoughts
to make you think.</i>

173
00:13:12,626 --> 00:13:16,255
Go ahead, shut it down.
I gotta go make a phone call.

174
00:13:17,047 --> 00:13:18,924
It's my wife's birthday.

175
00:13:20,008 --> 00:13:23,887
Okay, guys, gather 'round.

176
00:13:24,012 --> 00:13:25,806
Get in line. Specimen time.

177
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:28,892
That time of the month, guys.
Fill it up.

178
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,894
- Yvonne!
- Hey, sweetheart.

179
00:13:31,019 --> 00:13:32,771
- Cheers!
- You need some help?

180
00:13:32,813 --> 00:13:35,274
- There you go.
- We just spray the stuff. We don't drink it.

181
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:39,736
You need a magnifying glass
and a tweezers to help you out?

182
00:13:40,737 --> 00:13:43,407
<i>Hey, sweetheart.
Okay, you two.</i>

183
00:13:43,532 --> 00:13:46,368
<i>Y'all haven't been
taking anything, I hope.</i>

184
00:13:46,451 --> 00:13:50,706
<i>Don't let anything run on the sides,
okay? 'Cause that gets real nasty.</i>

185
00:14:02,926 --> 00:14:04,386
<i>- Hello?
- Chad!</i>

186
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:06,138
<i>What are you doing
up so early?</i>

187
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:09,141
- It's Mommy's birthday.
- Hey, that's right!

188
00:14:09,266 --> 00:14:11,643
<i>- Did Mom ask you to remind me?
- No.</i>

189
00:14:11,727 --> 00:14:13,937
- I'll bet she did.
- No, she didn't!

190
00:14:14,062 --> 00:14:16,899
<i>- I'll bet she did. You can tell Daddy.
- Give me that.</i>

191
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:20,444
- She did not!
- Go back to bed, young man.

192
00:14:20,527 --> 00:14:22,362
<i>- Stormy.
- Yeah!</i>

193
00:14:22,446 --> 00:14:24,114
<i>How'd you know?</i>

194
00:14:24,198 --> 00:14:26,992
Two more hours. Please!

195
00:14:27,075 --> 00:14:31,788
- Who else would call me at the crack of dawn?
- Hey, who was that? Chad?

196
00:14:31,872 --> 00:14:33,332
What do you want, Stormy?

197
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,917
I just wanted to see
what was on the agenda.

198
00:14:34,958 --> 00:14:38,795
I got Chad tonight, you know.
Wanna join us?

199
00:14:54,436 --> 00:14:56,688
Whoops. Sorry, sweetie.

200
00:15:07,908 --> 00:15:10,494
I really like the Wymans.
Don't you?

201
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:11,912
Who?

202
00:15:11,995 --> 00:15:14,456
The doctor and his wife.
Marian.

203
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:17,125
And Ralph, I think his name is.
You know, the ones from the concert.

204
00:15:17,209 --> 00:15:19,461
He seems, uh, kinda lofty.

205
00:15:21,088 --> 00:15:22,673
Off to work early, huh?

206
00:15:22,756 --> 00:15:25,467
Well, I got two birthdays today.

207
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,011
He's a doctor. Remember?

208
00:15:28,095 --> 00:15:31,223
- And she's an artist, I think.
- Oh, yeah? What kind?

209
00:15:31,306 --> 00:15:33,892
What kind? She's a painter.

210
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,436
You know.
She paints pictures.

211
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:39,940
- There's Vern.
- They really want us to come to dinner.

212
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:43,026
Well, we'll see. I'm off.

213
00:15:43,902 --> 00:15:45,571
What does that mean?

214
00:15:45,654 --> 00:15:48,824
We already agreed to go.
We made a date.

215
00:15:51,076 --> 00:15:52,828
Bye.

216
00:15:54,496 --> 00:15:56,790
Close the door, Stuart!

217
00:15:58,417 --> 00:16:00,377
Sorry.

218
00:16:11,054 --> 00:16:12,431
Got it.

219
00:16:13,849 --> 00:16:17,311
- Oh, Christ.
- I think it's broken.

220
00:16:17,394 --> 00:16:18,729
The little thing didn't come up.

221
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:20,522
Fuck!

222
00:16:21,231 --> 00:16:22,983
Why'd you let me sleep?

223
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:25,986
- How am I gonna explain this?
- I don't know.

224
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,363
- What, is it broken?
- Yeah.

225
00:16:28,447 --> 00:16:31,533
Is your kid awake?
I don't want him to see me here.

226
00:16:32,326 --> 00:16:34,036
Is he?

227
00:16:34,119 --> 00:16:36,538
He won't, baby.
He's still asleep.

228
00:16:37,206 --> 00:16:40,626
'Cause kids shouldn't see
that kind of thing.

229
00:16:40,709 --> 00:16:41,877
Jesus, how am I
gonna explain this?

230
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,338
Jesus. Okay.

231
00:16:44,421 --> 00:16:46,924
Kids. Crack.

232
00:16:47,007 --> 00:16:49,510
Kids... Kids on crack.
Okay.

233
00:16:49,593 --> 00:16:51,762
- What?
- Fucking dog.

234
00:16:51,845 --> 00:16:54,890
Fucking dog knows. I know.
That fucking dog.

235
00:16:54,973 --> 00:16:59,353
- Hey. Ruff! Ruff!
- Just can't live with all this.

236
00:16:59,436 --> 00:17:02,356
I need to... What are you
gotta smoke in the morning for?

237
00:17:02,439 --> 00:17:04,900
No, I told you I don't
wanna do that anymore.

238
00:18:03,458 --> 00:18:05,419
Honey?

239
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:09,590
Honey? You home?

240
00:18:10,507 --> 00:18:12,467
Make me some coffee!

241
00:18:13,552 --> 00:18:16,513
Oh. Something hit me
in the fuckin' head last night.

242
00:18:23,979 --> 00:18:25,856
Hello.

243
00:18:25,981 --> 00:18:27,566
Shut up.

244
00:18:36,533 --> 00:18:39,119
These you can mist.
Water them once a week.

245
00:18:39,203 --> 00:18:40,954
Harriet, we're running
behind schedule.

246
00:18:41,038 --> 00:18:44,041
- I'm gonna bring the bags down to the car.
- Okay. All right.

247
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,294
- Yeah. So those you can mist. Right.
- So these are the same...

248
00:18:48,545 --> 00:18:51,798
Jerry? Saturday's
Casey's birthday party.

249
00:18:51,882 --> 00:18:53,884
The plan was to swim.

250
00:18:53,967 --> 00:18:57,513
Howard's nephew's a lifeguard.
We were gonna pay him to watch the kids.

251
00:18:57,596 --> 00:19:00,140
But...
I don't know now.

252
00:19:00,224 --> 00:19:02,768
Maybe you should drain
the pool, change the water.

253
00:19:02,851 --> 00:19:05,812
Won't the "methalanon"
contaminate the water?

254
00:19:05,896 --> 00:19:07,731
They sprayed again last night.

255
00:19:07,773 --> 00:19:12,319
It's safe, Mrs. Finnigan.
It's only toxic for a few hours.

256
00:19:12,402 --> 00:19:14,321
The water actually
dilutes it, so...

257
00:19:14,363 --> 00:19:16,615
water's probably
the safest place to be.

258
00:19:16,698 --> 00:19:20,577
So irresponsible. Casey has allergies.
The slightest thing sets him off.

259
00:19:20,661 --> 00:19:22,454
I wouldn't worry about it,
Mrs. Finnigan.

260
00:19:22,538 --> 00:19:25,499
Well... why don't you
come again Saturday?

261
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:28,001
When's your next
regular day?

262
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:30,295
Tuesday.
I can't make it Saturday.

263
00:19:30,379 --> 00:19:32,506
- Hi.
- But really, I wouldn't worry about it.

264
00:19:32,589 --> 00:19:37,302
I was wondering if your guy
could treat my pool. Can you?

265
00:19:37,386 --> 00:19:39,096
Can I what?

266
00:19:39,221 --> 00:19:42,724
Whatever you put in it
to kill the bug spray.

267
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:44,393
I'll pay you.

268
00:19:44,476 --> 00:19:45,936
I'm afraid to go in.

269
00:19:46,019 --> 00:19:49,857
- I only have time to take care of
my regular customers, ma'am. I'm sorry.
- Hey, Jerry, can I help with the pool today?

270
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:53,652
- Casey, get back in the house.
It's still dangerous out here.
- Well, maybe I'll become a regular customer.

271
00:19:53,694 --> 00:19:55,737
- Get ready for school.
- Have you seen my wallet?

272
00:19:55,821 --> 00:19:58,532
- Oh. It's next to the phone.
- What's it doing there?

273
00:19:58,615 --> 00:20:02,160
Oh, I was ordering something
from this catalog.

274
00:20:02,202 --> 00:20:05,622
- Will you at least come over and look at it?
- Not now, ma'am!

275
00:20:05,706 --> 00:20:09,042
I... You know, I might be able to
swing back by in a couple of hours.

276
00:20:09,084 --> 00:20:12,629
I'm late. We'll talk about
your bearded iris tonight.

277
00:20:12,713 --> 00:20:15,799
Hey, Jer!
How goes the war?

278
00:20:15,883 --> 00:20:17,259
Bad guys are winning, sir.

279
00:20:17,301 --> 00:20:19,720
Yeah, well,
thank you very much.

280
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:36,945
Now, see, these bugs...
This Humphrey or this Royal Coachman...

281
00:20:36,987 --> 00:20:39,448
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

282
00:20:39,531 --> 00:20:42,075
"Doreen".
Is that your name? Doreen?

283
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:44,703
- That's it.
- Hey, Gordon, isn't that your first wife's name?

284
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:46,413
- Darlene.
- Oh.

285
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,832
- Darlene.
- Are you sure?

286
00:20:49,124 --> 00:20:50,501
No.

287
00:20:51,168 --> 00:20:54,963
- So, where we going, anyway, guys?
- An hour outside of Bakersfield.

288
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:57,508
- Then we're gonna walk.
- How far?

289
00:20:57,591 --> 00:21:00,594
Four or five hours.
There's nobody there.

290
00:21:00,677 --> 00:21:03,597
- You say it's good, right?
- Yeah. Is the fishing good?

291
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,265
- It's gorgeous.
- Oh, good.

292
00:21:05,349 --> 00:21:09,728
You've never seen anything like it.
They want to be caught.

293
00:21:09,811 --> 00:21:11,605
They're desperate
to be caught.

294
00:21:11,688 --> 00:21:13,774
What's that for?

295
00:21:14,691 --> 00:21:18,987
I thought I might have
to examine you later on.

296
00:21:19,071 --> 00:21:20,197
Where'd you get it?

297
00:21:20,322 --> 00:21:24,117
Some doctor left it in my web.

298
00:21:24,201 --> 00:21:26,954
- Better take it to the lost and found.
- Yeah.

299
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,914
What's the menu like, babe?

300
00:21:28,997 --> 00:21:32,709
The Greek's watching. Don't order
anything you can't pay for.

301
00:21:40,467 --> 00:21:42,427
Daddy's home!

302
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,679
Pow! Pow! Pow!

303
00:21:43,762 --> 00:21:46,306
Daddy, you gonna take us
to the park today?

304
00:21:46,390 --> 00:21:48,725
Off me! Off me!

305
00:21:48,809 --> 00:21:50,894
- Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!
- Quiet!

306
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:53,605
Cut it out.

307
00:21:55,566 --> 00:21:57,985
Quiet! Quiet!

308
00:21:58,902 --> 00:22:00,070
Get in the house.

309
00:22:00,153 --> 00:22:03,115
- Did you do this?
- No. The dog did!

310
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:06,243
Mommy, Mommy, Daddy's home!
Daddy's home!

311
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,203
That's really exciting, sweetheart.
Please finish eating.

312
00:22:08,287 --> 00:22:11,206
- Bang! Bang! I saw Dada!
- Please don't point that gun at me.

313
00:22:11,290 --> 00:22:13,292
Who gave the dog my belt?

314
00:22:14,877 --> 00:22:16,336
This is completely destroyed.

315
00:22:16,420 --> 00:22:18,463
Completely ruined.
It's a piece of trash.

316
00:22:18,547 --> 00:22:20,424
It's a $35 belt!

317
00:22:20,507 --> 00:22:21,592
Shut up!

318
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,928
- That dog has got to go.
- Wanna talk about where you were last night?

319
00:22:25,012 --> 00:22:28,056
No, I don't.
Not in front of the kids, I don't.

320
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:32,603
I don't want them to hear about all the
"ain-pay" and "isery-may" I saw last night.

321
00:22:32,686 --> 00:22:36,106
If you would like to hear
about kids on C-R-A-C-K...

322
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,108
you can come in
the other room.

323
00:22:42,237 --> 00:22:45,157
Whose crack are we
talking about, Gene?

324
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:46,950
<i>I got a list here.</i>

325
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,620
<i>Um, I canceled the 'Times'.
I stopped the mail.</i>

326
00:22:49,703 --> 00:22:51,622
<i>Just check up on the fish...</i>

327
00:22:51,747 --> 00:22:54,374
Harriet! Enough about
the fish. Let's go.

328
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:56,168
- Okay, okay.
- Which one takes the, um, goldfish?

329
00:22:56,251 --> 00:22:59,046
These are the lionfish,
and these are the goldfish.

330
00:22:59,087 --> 00:23:01,632
- Come on. I don't wanna miss that plane.
- Okay.

331
00:23:01,757 --> 00:23:04,551
Just feed the other fish
regular food.

332
00:23:08,805 --> 00:23:12,100
- Hey, sorry. You guys are running late, huh?
- Yeah. She keeps running her mouth.

333
00:23:12,226 --> 00:23:15,187
Uh-huh.
You need a hand with those?

334
00:23:20,692 --> 00:23:24,696
- I gotta go. Jim's gonna have a fit,
and I gotta make sure I have the tickets.
- Have a good time in Memphis.

335
00:23:24,738 --> 00:23:26,615
Thank you.
Have you got the keys?

336
00:23:26,698 --> 00:23:28,617
- And, um, that's it.
- All right.

337
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,827
- Say happy birthday to your mom.
- Bye.

338
00:23:30,911 --> 00:23:33,330
Bring us back some
of that country ham.

339
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:35,332
- You're not gonna smoke in my house.
- I'm sorry.

340
00:23:35,415 --> 00:23:37,626
- Thanks. Bye.
- Bye-bye.

341
00:23:37,709 --> 00:23:39,336
Bye-bye, Harriet.

342
00:23:39,419 --> 00:23:41,213
- Come on.
- They are so full of shit.

343
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,215
They've been good to us.
Don't smoke, Bill.

344
00:23:43,257 --> 00:23:46,009
They brought us to a jazz bar, gave us
a couple of drinks. And what do we do?

345
00:23:46,051 --> 00:23:49,847
We're taking care of their apartment free
for a month. They're taking advantage of us.

346
00:23:49,930 --> 00:23:53,976
- Don't you have some classes or something?
- I don't punch a time card. I'm not in high school.

347
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:55,352
So, what are you
gonna order?

348
00:23:55,394 --> 00:23:57,980
Uh, let's see, baby.

349
00:23:58,856 --> 00:24:02,067
- I can't read this.
- Honey, put on your real glasses.

350
00:24:05,696 --> 00:24:07,447
Let's see.

351
00:24:09,575 --> 00:24:12,953
- Tuna melt.
- Tuna melt? It's breakfast.

352
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:17,457
- Have a steak and some eggs.
- Not if I have to pay for it, baby.

353
00:24:17,541 --> 00:24:19,543
You're not drinkin', are you?

354
00:24:20,627 --> 00:24:22,754
- Is that what's startin'?
- No.

355
00:24:27,009 --> 00:24:28,719
Very... Ohh!

356
00:24:31,013 --> 00:24:33,515
Suddenly there's God
so quickly.

357
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:36,268
My goodness.

358
00:24:36,977 --> 00:24:39,438
Gordon, how about that ass?

359
00:24:39,521 --> 00:24:40,856
I've seen better.

360
00:24:40,939 --> 00:24:43,525
I just saw what
she had for breakfast.

361
00:24:43,609 --> 00:24:47,029
Where have you seen better? Penthouse?
I say that's money in the bank.

362
00:24:47,112 --> 00:24:49,865
- What do you think, Stuart?
- Not for breakfast.

363
00:24:49,948 --> 00:24:52,034
- Excuse me, honey.
- Yeah?

364
00:24:52,117 --> 00:24:53,994
Uh, could we have...

365
00:24:54,077 --> 00:24:56,455
What was it in the bottom drawer
over there you were getting?

366
00:24:56,538 --> 00:24:59,833
- What, butter?
- Yeah. Could we have more butter, please?

367
00:25:07,216 --> 00:25:10,677
Here you go. Oh, hey,
is my tuna melt workin'?

368
00:25:10,761 --> 00:25:13,430
Well, I'd say this trip's
off to a pretty good start.

369
00:25:13,514 --> 00:25:14,973
Yeah.

370
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:18,602
I say the tuna melt works.

371
00:25:18,685 --> 00:25:21,230
- Cup of coffee.
- Yeah, okay.

372
00:25:23,273 --> 00:25:24,775
You know what we need?

373
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,319
More, uh, you-know-what.

374
00:25:27,402 --> 00:25:30,072
Uh, could we have
some more butter, please?

375
00:25:31,114 --> 00:25:33,617
Oh, yeah. Okay. Butter.
Coming up.

376
00:25:39,623 --> 00:25:42,918
Is that your face,
or your neck just threw up?

377
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:46,213
- We're out of butter.
- Out of butter.

378
00:25:46,296 --> 00:25:48,257
Ask for margarine.

379
00:25:49,007 --> 00:25:50,259
Well, then what did he do?

380
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:52,553
<i>He walks in at
7:30 in the morning.</i>

381
00:25:52,594 --> 00:25:56,139
<i>The kids are screaming. They're
happy to see him. Same old story.</i>

382
00:25:56,181 --> 00:25:58,433
<i>Sits down. He's acting
like nothing's happened.</i>

383
00:25:58,517 --> 00:26:00,644
<i>I have no explanation.
Nothing.</i>

384
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:03,397
<i>- So he's out having breakfast with her.
- Are you serious?</i>

385
00:26:03,438 --> 00:26:06,900
<i>Yeah! I mean, I tried
to ask him where he was, and...</i>

386
00:26:06,984 --> 00:26:08,443
<i>he gave me some...
- I'm going.</i>

387
00:26:08,527 --> 00:26:11,154
<i>- Where's he going?
- He's going to work. Okay.</i>

388
00:26:11,238 --> 00:26:14,491
<i>He gives me some ridiculous
excuse like... like crack kids...</i>

389
00:26:14,616 --> 00:26:16,952
- Who you talking to?
- I'm talking to Sherri.

390
00:26:17,035 --> 00:26:19,037
<i>- And, um... And, um...
- Bye!</i>

391
00:26:19,079 --> 00:26:22,332
<i>And now I'm not even supposed to
say the word "crack" in front of them.</i>

392
00:26:22,416 --> 00:26:24,459
<i>Now tell me about
the Alex Trebek thing.</i>

393
00:26:24,501 --> 00:26:25,586
Did he flirt with you?

394
00:26:25,627 --> 00:26:27,045
<i>- Who?
- Alex Trebek.</i>

395
00:26:27,087 --> 00:26:30,507
<i>No! Oh, no. I mean...</i>

396
00:26:30,591 --> 00:26:32,593
- Shut up!
- What's so threatening about that?

397
00:26:32,634 --> 00:26:35,596
<i>- Nothing.
- Sherri, where are my keys?</i>

398
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,308
Will you get out of here?

399
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:43,854
Sherri! The dog pissed
on the bed again, Sherri.

400
00:26:43,979 --> 00:26:47,065
<i>Shoot him, man!
Shoot him! He's crazy!</i>

401
00:26:47,149 --> 00:26:48,275
Who are you
talking to, anyway?

402
00:26:48,358 --> 00:26:51,987
Yeah, in those nice, tight pants he likes
'cause it makes his dick look big.

403
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,282
What? I can't hear you.
The dog's barking.

404
00:26:55,365 --> 00:26:57,075
I'm talking to my sister.

405
00:26:57,159 --> 00:27:00,621
Yap, yap, yap.
Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!

406
00:27:00,704 --> 00:27:05,459
- Yap, yap, yap, yap, yap!
- Where are you going, Gene?

407
00:27:05,542 --> 00:27:08,003
I thought you had
some time off this week.

408
00:27:08,086 --> 00:27:10,380
I gotta check on my work.
Quality control.

409
00:27:10,506 --> 00:27:12,758
Uh-huh.
How about tonight, Gene?

410
00:27:15,135 --> 00:27:17,137
- Oh, God.
- Sherri.

411
00:27:17,221 --> 00:27:18,388
<i>- Just a minute.
- Okay.</i>

412
00:27:18,472 --> 00:27:22,059
You know what kind of
work I do, right? Look at me!

413
00:27:24,228 --> 00:27:27,064
You know it's dangerous...

414
00:27:27,147 --> 00:27:30,817
and you know there's things you
can't know for your own safety, right?

415
00:27:30,901 --> 00:27:33,487
I was just asking
about dinner.

416
00:27:35,989 --> 00:27:38,575
Don't you worry your
pretty little head about it.

417
00:27:43,413 --> 00:27:45,707
- He's out of here.
- All right, kids.

418
00:27:47,251 --> 00:27:50,629
<i>What is he talking about?</i>

419
00:27:50,754 --> 00:27:53,632
- The king is gone.
- Come on, Suzy. Come on.

420
00:27:53,757 --> 00:27:56,552
Close the gate when you go!
I don't want Suzy to get out!

421
00:27:56,635 --> 00:27:58,512
He might get run over!

422
00:27:58,595 --> 00:28:00,681
Casey?

423
00:28:01,515 --> 00:28:04,434
You are gonna be late
for school, young man.

424
00:28:04,518 --> 00:28:07,354
- Now, do you want me to drive you?
- No. I'll walk.

425
00:28:07,437 --> 00:28:10,899
You sure?
All right, kisses. Okay.

426
00:29:00,574 --> 00:29:03,535
Oh, my God.

427
00:29:04,745 --> 00:29:06,455
Honey! Honey, you all right?

428
00:29:06,538 --> 00:29:08,916
- I... I'm fine.
- Wait, wait, wait!

429
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:12,085
Let me get your stuff.
Here. Wait, I'll...

430
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:14,713
- Come on, let's get in my car.
- No, I-I'm fine.

431
00:29:14,796 --> 00:29:17,424
My mom doesn't want me
to go in a car with strangers.

432
00:29:17,508 --> 00:29:21,678
No, wait a minute. Let me give you
a ride home, make sure you're okay.

433
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:24,348
I'm... I'm fine.
For sure.

434
00:29:24,473 --> 00:29:27,309
No, no. Look.

435
00:29:27,392 --> 00:29:29,228
Come on.
How old are you?

436
00:29:29,311 --> 00:29:31,730
I'm eight.
My birthday's tomorrow.

437
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:34,816
I wanna see your mom and dad.
I wanna make sure you're okay.

438
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:39,738
My mom said
I can't talk with strangers.

439
00:29:47,538 --> 00:29:49,498
Hey, bye.

440
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:20,028
- Have you got ready-made birthday cakes?
- Yeah. They're right here.

441
00:30:20,153 --> 00:30:23,031
- Have you got one with "Betty" on it already?
- Just what you see here.

442
00:30:23,156 --> 00:30:25,200
I can do something special,
but not for today.

443
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:28,579
Yeah. Well, all right,
I'll take that one. What is it?

444
00:30:28,662 --> 00:30:31,790
- It's a lemon cake.
- Can you maybe put her name on it?

445
00:30:31,874 --> 00:30:34,585
- I can't do it today.
- All right. Well, how much is it?

446
00:30:34,668 --> 00:30:37,588
It's 14.75 with tax.
Mrs. Schwarzmeier, can you box this up?

447
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:39,590
Jawohl, Herr Bitkower.

448
00:30:39,673 --> 00:30:43,635
Mrs. Schw... Could you maybe...
Could you just write "Betty" on here?

449
00:30:43,719 --> 00:30:45,345
"Betty"? No. No.

450
00:30:49,933 --> 00:30:52,192
- Hi.
- I'd like to order a birthday cake.

451
00:30:52,269 --> 00:30:54,354
- Sure. What kind?
- Birthdays. They keep adding up, huh?

452
00:30:54,438 --> 00:30:56,023
- Here is your cake and your change.
- Thanks.

453
00:30:56,064 --> 00:30:58,859
Oh, I've got a couple
ideas here.

454
00:30:58,942 --> 00:31:01,862
Okay, this is what I'd like.

455
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:04,198
What's that say?
"Happy Birthday, Casey"?

456
00:31:04,281 --> 00:31:06,658
- Oh, excuse me.
- Yes. Casey.

457
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:09,328
- And is that supposed to be a baseball bat?
- Hi, Mrs. Schwarzmeier.

458
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:11,622
Yes, that's a baseball bat.
I don't draw very well.

459
00:31:11,663 --> 00:31:14,333
- I came to pick up the cake
for Debbie Eggenweiler.
- Are you sure you want this?

460
00:31:14,374 --> 00:31:16,960
Because I have some
very nice baseball designs.

461
00:31:17,044 --> 00:31:18,670
- I think it's prepaid.
- Yes. Yes.

462
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:22,341
- If you like this, I can do it.
- No, I like this.

463
00:31:22,466 --> 00:31:26,094
He's, um, he's starting Little League,
so we're real excited.

464
00:31:26,178 --> 00:31:29,097
That's really sweet. His name
is Casey, and he plays baseball.

465
00:31:30,265 --> 00:31:32,851
- Down, down.
- No, no, no, no, no.

466
00:31:39,858 --> 00:31:41,944
Beautiful shot, man.

467
00:31:45,989 --> 00:31:48,408
Hey. Casey. What's up?

468
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:50,410
How come you're
not in school?

469
00:31:50,494 --> 00:31:53,038
- Let him go.
- Hey, Casey, you wanna see the dribble?

470
00:31:53,163 --> 00:31:55,707
- Come on, Joe!
- Hey! Heads up!

471
00:31:55,832 --> 00:31:57,751
- Come on. We're ahead too.
- Let's go.

472
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,962
Pass you. Pass you.

473
00:32:00,796 --> 00:32:02,923
Yo, good pass, good pass.

474
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:18,564
Take a right
down by that tree.

475
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:23,986
- That's all?
- Okay. I got it, I got it.

476
00:32:24,069 --> 00:32:26,530
Goddamn back seat.

477
00:32:31,827 --> 00:32:33,787
Hey, Doreen.

478
00:32:35,330 --> 00:32:39,209
<i>Paul Grossman got me
more than $1 million.</i>

479
00:32:39,334 --> 00:32:43,213
<i>Call me. Paul Grossman.
I'll be your attorney too.</i>

480
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:47,342
<i>Call toll-free. We'll come to your
home or office anywhere in California.</i>

481
00:32:47,467 --> 00:32:52,681
<i>1-800-462-5555</i>

482
00:32:52,764 --> 00:32:55,684
<i>Once a year, the P.B.A.
Touring pros join forces...</i>

483
00:32:55,767 --> 00:32:58,228
<i>in doubles competitions.</i>

484
00:32:58,312 --> 00:33:01,356
What's the door doing
standing wide open?

485
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,694
Hey, you...
you hungry, honey?

486
00:33:05,777 --> 00:33:07,404
What are you doing, anyway?

487
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,741
How come you're not workin'?

488
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:12,618
You're not gonna lose
your job again, are you?

489
00:33:12,701 --> 00:33:15,495
You'd better give that back.
Some doctor's gonna be looking for it.

490
00:33:15,579 --> 00:33:19,166
I got London broil from the Greek.
You want me to fix it? Want me to freeze it?

491
00:33:19,249 --> 00:33:22,294
Doreen, Doreen
the question queen

492
00:33:22,377 --> 00:33:26,507
Stole a London broil
thick and lean

493
00:33:26,590 --> 00:33:29,384
Hey, how 'bout a fruit plate?
Somethin' light?

494
00:33:29,468 --> 00:33:32,387
How 'bout a
short skirt, Doreen?

495
00:33:32,471 --> 00:33:35,724
Short enough so I can see every
inch of your ass. How'd that be?

496
00:33:35,807 --> 00:33:38,977
- What are you talkin' crazy for?
- Yeah.

497
00:33:39,061 --> 00:33:41,063
We don't wanna talk
about that, do we?

498
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:44,191
We just wanna talk about Earl.

499
00:33:44,274 --> 00:33:46,985
Let's hear more about Earl.

500
00:33:47,444 --> 00:33:49,238
How 'bout cops, baby?

501
00:33:49,321 --> 00:33:51,990
I bet they love
those short skirts.

502
00:33:52,115 --> 00:33:54,409
I know fishermen like 'em!

503
00:33:56,912 --> 00:33:59,122
- Whoa!
- No, man, wait a second.

504
00:34:04,127 --> 00:34:06,088
What happened?

505
00:34:08,465 --> 00:34:10,551
- Aw, Christ!
- What happened?

506
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:14,513
That's half my supply.

507
00:34:17,307 --> 00:34:19,726
- Okay? Let's do it.
- All right. Let's go.

508
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,318
- Watch your step.
- Man, I'm thirsty already.

509
00:34:28,443 --> 00:34:31,905
Well, we only got
3 hours and 59 minutes left.

510
00:34:34,741 --> 00:34:38,370
Well, I don't think
it's gonna rain.

511
00:35:10,152 --> 00:35:11,904
Casey?

512
00:35:11,987 --> 00:35:15,157
What are you doing home, honey?
Why aren't you at school?

513
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:18,535
Honey? What happened?

514
00:35:18,619 --> 00:35:20,412
I got hit by a car.

515
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:25,042
What? What do you mean,
you got hit by a car? Where? How?

516
00:35:25,125 --> 00:35:27,836
Casey, now you tell Mommy
exactly what happened.

517
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:30,631
I got hit in the back
and knocked down hard.

518
00:35:30,714 --> 00:35:33,717
- Well, how did you get home?
- Walked.

519
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:36,678
Well...
Casey, let me look at you.

520
00:35:36,803 --> 00:35:39,264
Ohh. Now, um...

521
00:35:40,766 --> 00:35:45,020
What about this car?
How fast was it going? Who hit you?

522
00:35:45,145 --> 00:35:48,607
She was a lady.
She was nice.

523
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:50,484
Listen, honey...

524
00:35:50,609 --> 00:35:52,611
today...

525
00:35:52,736 --> 00:35:55,072
something terrible happened.

526
00:35:55,864 --> 00:35:58,659
I hit this little kid with my car.

527
00:35:58,742 --> 00:36:00,786
- Oh...
- He didn't get hurt. He was okay.

528
00:36:00,869 --> 00:36:05,832
- But, Jesus, it scared the hell out of me.
- Oh, Jesus. All right, were the cops there?

529
00:36:05,916 --> 00:36:07,709
I told you, he wasn't hurt.

530
00:36:07,793 --> 00:36:09,711
Okay. All right, listen.

531
00:36:09,795 --> 00:36:11,713
Did they get your name?

532
00:36:11,797 --> 00:36:14,049
I told you, nobody was there.
He's all right.

533
00:36:14,091 --> 00:36:16,343
Okay. All right.
I just don't wanna get sued.

534
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:19,763
No, it was just a
stroke of luck I didn't kill him.

535
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:22,266
I'm glad somebody's
luck's holdin' out.

536
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,686
Excuse me. Excuse me. Howard?
You have a phone call.

537
00:36:25,769 --> 00:36:27,688
It's... It's your wife.

538
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:29,690
I think you've got time.

539
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,442
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

540
00:36:32,526 --> 00:36:34,194
Excuse me.

541
00:36:34,278 --> 00:36:38,115
Jerry, we've got some great stuff,
good footage coming in on the satellite.

542
00:36:38,198 --> 00:36:39,449
<i>- Hello.
- Howard?</i>

543
00:36:39,491 --> 00:36:41,660
<i>- Yeah?
- Casey got hit by a car.</i>

544
00:36:41,785 --> 00:36:44,621
<i>He's all right, though.</i>

545
00:36:44,705 --> 00:36:46,123
What do you mean,
hit by a car?

546
00:36:46,206 --> 00:36:47,708
<i>When? Where is he?</i>

547
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:50,878
Well, h-h-he's here.
He's home with me.

548
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:52,796
He's... He's all right.
He's not hurt.

549
00:36:52,921 --> 00:36:56,175
<i>Annie, calm down,
start from the beginning,</i>

550
00:36:56,258 --> 00:36:58,552
<i>and tell me exactly
what happened.</i>

551
00:36:58,635 --> 00:37:01,054
Well, I put him in bed, and...

552
00:37:01,138 --> 00:37:03,390
he fell fast asleep.

553
00:37:03,473 --> 00:37:05,809
He's all right, I'm sure.

554
00:37:05,893 --> 00:37:09,146
Why'd you let him go to sleep?
You shouldn't have done that, honey.

555
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:12,399
Jesus Christ! I mean, wh...
Who hit him? How did this happen?

556
00:37:12,482 --> 00:37:16,904
I don't know!
I came home and he was here.

557
00:37:16,987 --> 00:37:20,908
I... He went to sleep.
I should let him sleep, shouldn't I?

558
00:37:20,991 --> 00:37:22,451
<i>No. No, you wake him up...</i>

559
00:37:22,534 --> 00:37:25,871
<i>and you take him to the emergency room.
You gotta get him looked at right away.</i>

560
00:37:25,954 --> 00:37:28,123
Call Bob Winslow.
No, wait, I'll call him.

561
00:37:28,248 --> 00:37:31,168
<i>Um, just hang up the phone.
I'll call you right back. Okay?</i>

562
00:37:31,251 --> 00:37:34,546
<i>- All right. I understand.
- Okay. Don't worry.</i>

563
00:37:34,630 --> 00:37:37,007
Everything's gonna be all right.
He's gonna be fine.

564
00:37:39,468 --> 00:37:41,553
Casey?

565
00:37:41,678 --> 00:37:45,599
Casey, we're... we're gonna
get up and have some milk now.

566
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,353
Casey? Casey, um...

567
00:37:50,687 --> 00:37:52,898
Casey, Daddy's coming home.

568
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:56,693
Casey.

569
00:37:56,944 --> 00:37:59,238
Casey.

570
00:37:59,363 --> 00:38:02,658
Casey. Casey, wake up!

571
00:38:02,741 --> 00:38:04,701
Casey, wake up!

572
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:07,829
<i>Accidents happen every day.</i>

573
00:38:07,955 --> 00:38:10,791
<i>Fortunately, most are harmless.</i>

574
00:38:10,874 --> 00:38:13,168
<i>But some are very serious.</i>

575
00:38:13,252 --> 00:38:16,004
He's eight years old.
I asked him.

576
00:38:16,088 --> 00:38:18,507
Tomorrow's his birthday.

577
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:20,676
Such a close call.

578
00:38:21,635 --> 00:38:23,679
Everything could have changed.
Our whole lives could have changed.

579
00:38:23,804 --> 00:38:28,350
Yeah, well, I wish somethin'
would come along and change our life.

580
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:33,021
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Oh, nothin'.

581
00:38:34,064 --> 00:38:38,360
Look, maybe I'm just sick and tired of
watching you show off your ass at work.

582
00:38:38,485 --> 00:38:41,738
Oh, you're drunk. And you lied to me.
Get the hell out of here.

583
00:38:41,864 --> 00:38:45,701
You want me out of here?
You got it.

584
00:38:45,784 --> 00:38:49,246
You told me you weren't gonna lie no more.
That was the deal... no more lies.

585
00:38:49,371 --> 00:38:51,248
Okay. Watch me go, baby.

586
00:38:51,373 --> 00:38:55,752
You know, a lot of guys don't like a big ass
in their face when they're trying to eat.

587
00:38:55,878 --> 00:38:58,755
Oh, pick a fight. Go ahead.
Pick a fight with me.

588
00:39:00,883 --> 00:39:02,759
Tell you something...

589
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:07,014
I don't know who you think would wanna
look at your sad, middle-aged ass anyway.

590
00:39:07,097 --> 00:39:09,183
Don't you talk to me like that.
And don't you come back here.

591
00:39:09,224 --> 00:39:12,603
I'm not taking you back no more.
You understand? No more!

592
00:39:12,728 --> 00:39:15,272
- No more I'm not taking you back!
- I'm not coming back!

593
00:39:15,355 --> 00:39:18,650
- Slobberin' all over Honey like that.
- I never touched Honey!

594
00:39:18,734 --> 00:39:20,986
I didn't say you touched her!
I said you slobbered on her!

595
00:39:21,028 --> 00:39:23,405
How come you don't wear your
wedding ring to work anymore?

596
00:39:23,447 --> 00:39:24,698
Oh, you're such
a bullshit artist.

597
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:28,952
You're the one chippin' away at
our mansion of love, baby, not me!

598
00:39:29,036 --> 00:39:31,371
Why don't you go get drunk
and pee on Irmadine's drapes again!

599
00:39:31,413 --> 00:39:32,581
<i>I'm gonna
go get drunk!</i>

600
00:39:32,623 --> 00:39:35,417
I'm gonna get drunk
right now, goddamn it!

601
00:39:38,629 --> 00:39:41,215
Look how stupid you're acting.

602
00:39:44,635 --> 00:39:46,970
What if I'd killed him?
Then what?

603
00:39:49,389 --> 00:39:52,601
Oh, Pat! What are you lookin' at?
It's nothin' new!

604
00:39:52,684 --> 00:39:54,520
Have a nice day.

605
00:39:55,646 --> 00:39:59,650
<i>And now back
to 'Captain Planet'.</i>

606
00:39:59,733 --> 00:40:04,446
<i>It's as much fun poaching
Planeteers as it is poaching elephants!</i>

607
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:06,823
<i>I have had enough of this!</i>

608
00:40:11,328 --> 00:40:13,664
<i>- Betty! Chad! It's me!
- Your dad's here.</i>

609
00:40:13,747 --> 00:40:15,874
Come on. Let's go.

610
00:40:15,958 --> 00:40:17,626
All right! I'm coming!

611
00:40:17,751 --> 00:40:19,628
- Let's go.
- Give me that.

612
00:40:19,753 --> 00:40:22,214
<i>- Betty, the key doesn't work!
- Yeah!</i>

613
00:40:22,297 --> 00:40:25,008
Listen, don't you have any fun.
Stay up really late. Okay?

614
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,635
- Give me a kiss.
- Okay.

615
00:40:28,762 --> 00:40:31,682
You changed the lock.
Happy birthday!

616
00:40:31,765 --> 00:40:36,270
- Look at this helicopter I got! Isn't it neat?
- Cool! Come on. Make a wish and blow.

617
00:40:36,353 --> 00:40:38,647
And there's a net
to catch the Planeteers in it.

618
00:40:38,730 --> 00:40:41,942
It's really neat. And there's
Verminous Skumm inside.

619
00:40:42,025 --> 00:40:45,863
He's one of the Eco-villains. Not a good guy.
I don't really like him very much.

620
00:40:45,988 --> 00:40:49,157
- But it's neat.
- You're not all blown out, are you?

621
00:40:49,241 --> 00:40:51,827
Hey, how come there's
only one candle?

622
00:40:51,910 --> 00:40:53,495
Mommy's 29.

623
00:40:53,579 --> 00:40:55,205
- Sure she is.
- Shut up.

624
00:40:55,289 --> 00:40:56,248
That's what she told me.

625
00:40:56,290 --> 00:41:00,294
I'm just trying to get Mommy used to
one big candle instead of a lot of little ones.

626
00:41:00,419 --> 00:41:03,630
Is that a joke?

627
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:05,090
Come on. Blow!

628
00:41:06,550 --> 00:41:07,801
<i>Wait till you discover...</i>

629
00:41:07,885 --> 00:41:09,678
<i>the rest of my surprises!
- Ohh!</i>

630
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:12,055
- You got your wish!
- What'd you wish for?

631
00:41:12,139 --> 00:41:14,224
That the two of you
would get the hell out of here.

632
00:41:14,308 --> 00:41:16,393
Oh, Betty, you gotta
keep this wound.

633
00:41:16,476 --> 00:41:19,688
It's your clock, Stormy.
You take it and keep it wound.

634
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:22,900
I want you gone when
I'm out of the shower.

635
00:41:43,754 --> 00:41:45,214
Suzy, come on, boy.

636
00:41:47,174 --> 00:41:51,303
All right, now, you go run away.
We don't want you anymore.

637
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,389
Go ahead.

638
00:41:54,515 --> 00:41:56,391
Hey, hey, hey.
Sniff this.

639
00:41:56,517 --> 00:41:59,269
Mm-mmm! Look at that.
It's a bone. Mmm!

640
00:41:59,353 --> 00:42:02,481
All right, go get it.

641
00:42:12,908 --> 00:42:15,077
Make sure they do the
neuro checks every half hour.

642
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:17,996
And diligent suctioning.

643
00:42:20,374 --> 00:42:22,334
Mr. Finnigan.

644
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,713
- Yeah?
- He's resting comfortably.

645
00:42:26,797 --> 00:42:30,425
That's good. We'll let him sleep.
That's the best thing for him right now.

646
00:42:30,884 --> 00:42:32,928
The medfly editorial.

647
00:42:33,011 --> 00:42:35,764
Not too sure about
that malathion.

648
00:42:35,848 --> 00:42:37,057
Nurse, can you get me
some aspirin?

649
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,976
- Sure, Doctor.
- It's for me.

650
00:42:41,562 --> 00:42:44,606
He's got a small blood clot,
a little brain swelling,

651
00:42:44,690 --> 00:42:47,192
but it probably
won't require surgery.

652
00:42:47,276 --> 00:42:50,112
He's aspirated, but we're
not too concerned about that.

653
00:42:50,195 --> 00:42:52,823
- Aspirated? What is that?
- He's got some fluid in his lungs.

654
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:56,159
Listen, we'll keep
a close eye on him. Okay?

655
00:42:59,830 --> 00:43:03,083
He knows what he's doing.
It's gonna be all right, honey.

656
00:43:03,166 --> 00:43:05,210
- I, uh...
- Three more.

657
00:43:06,336 --> 00:43:09,173
Damn shame you can't feel safe
driving in this city no more.

658
00:43:09,256 --> 00:43:12,426
His vital signs are good. We're just
gonna have to wait till he wakes up.

659
00:43:12,509 --> 00:43:16,471
Is there something we could do?
Something we should do?

660
00:43:16,555 --> 00:43:18,765
You can wait. There's a
waiting room down the hall.

661
00:43:18,849 --> 00:43:21,768
There's smoking out on the porch,
if you want to smoke.

662
00:43:21,852 --> 00:43:24,771
He may be waking up soon.
You'll wanna be here when he does.

663
00:43:24,855 --> 00:43:28,525
Yeah, well, uh, listen, how...
how long you think it'll... it'll be?

664
00:43:28,650 --> 00:43:30,569
You never know with
these things. I just...

665
00:43:30,652 --> 00:43:33,113
want you to do whatever
makes you feel comfortable.

666
00:43:33,197 --> 00:43:36,200
<i>Come on, come on, come on!</i>

667
00:43:36,325 --> 00:43:38,577
- You made it.
- Yeah!

668
00:43:40,329 --> 00:43:43,123
I hope you don't have to
put too much chlorine in.

669
00:43:43,207 --> 00:43:45,000
It's bad for my voice.

670
00:43:45,542 --> 00:43:47,085
The pool's around the back.

671
00:43:51,632 --> 00:43:54,009
Jonathan, that's you, babe!
Go up, go up!

672
00:43:54,134 --> 00:43:56,803
- Right here, right here, right here!
- Zoe!

673
00:43:59,014 --> 00:44:00,057
Excuse me.

674
00:44:00,140 --> 00:44:02,518
Um, see how
that bruise is... is...

675
00:44:02,601 --> 00:44:05,437
it's intense,
but it's not glowing.

676
00:44:05,521 --> 00:44:08,190
So you'll wanna work on that.
Let's take a look at yours.

677
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:11,527
This is good. I like that. Yeah.
The bruise is really good.

678
00:44:11,652 --> 00:44:16,532
Um... I want you to put
a little bit more blood in there.

679
00:44:16,657 --> 00:44:18,534
Oh, on the...
on the, uh... on...

680
00:44:18,659 --> 00:44:20,536
Yeah, blend off
that one edge.

681
00:44:20,661 --> 00:44:23,038
- And take the brush out of your mouth.
- Sorry.

682
00:44:23,163 --> 00:44:25,123
Filter? What's the filter
got to do with it?

683
00:44:25,165 --> 00:44:29,211
Well, if your filter ain't workin', and I don't
think it is, there's not much I can do.

684
00:44:29,336 --> 00:44:32,381
How dangerous is
this malathion?

685
00:44:32,506 --> 00:44:35,384
Well... How long
have you had this system?

686
00:44:35,509 --> 00:44:37,094
Came with the house.

687
00:44:37,177 --> 00:44:39,054
Yeah? Well,

688
00:44:39,137 --> 00:44:42,683
I hate to be the one to tell you,
but I think it's on its last legs.

689
00:44:42,766 --> 00:44:45,185
Oh, no. Don't tell me.

690
00:44:45,352 --> 00:44:48,730
- So, Ace, what's up tonight?
- I don't know. What do you wanna do?

691
00:44:48,814 --> 00:44:52,776
I mean, with Mom. Is she celebrating
her birthday alone, or what?

692
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:55,195
Uh, with Gene.

693
00:44:55,279 --> 00:44:56,947
Jean, huh?

694
00:44:57,072 --> 00:44:58,782
Jean.

695
00:44:58,949 --> 00:45:00,951
Jean.

696
00:45:01,076 --> 00:45:02,995
Well, who's she?

697
00:45:03,078 --> 00:45:05,706
<i>He's a friend of Mommy's.</i>

698
00:45:30,898 --> 00:45:33,609
May I see your license
and registration, ma'am?

699
00:45:41,408 --> 00:45:42,868
Did I do something wrong,
Officer?

700
00:45:42,951 --> 00:45:45,579
Take your
sunglasses off, ma'am.

701
00:45:51,543 --> 00:45:54,087
You know, this clown
is detachable.

702
00:45:54,171 --> 00:45:56,340
I, um... I have
a permit for it.

703
00:45:56,423 --> 00:45:58,926
It's to code. I've been stopped before.
There's never been a problem.

704
00:45:58,967 --> 00:46:03,388
- Phone number, ma'am?
- 504-0361.

705
00:46:04,765 --> 00:46:07,643
I'm gonna let you go with
a warning this time, ma'am.

706
00:46:07,768 --> 00:46:12,147
You were driving too slow.
Just as dangerous as driving too fast.

707
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,401
Please refrain from
doing so in the future.

708
00:46:20,572 --> 00:46:22,282
Can I go now?

709
00:46:22,366 --> 00:46:25,494
No, ma'am.
I have one more question.

710
00:46:25,577 --> 00:46:27,538
What's that?

711
00:46:29,665 --> 00:46:32,000
How many clowns
can you fit in this car?

712
00:46:32,835 --> 00:46:34,586
I beg your pardon?

713
00:46:34,670 --> 00:46:37,130
How many clowns can you
fit in this car, ma'am?

714
00:46:37,256 --> 00:46:39,675
Why'd you take
my phone number?

715
00:46:39,758 --> 00:46:43,762
Well, you never know when you might
need the services of a clown, ma'am.

716
00:46:43,887 --> 00:46:46,306
- You have children?
- No, ma'am.

717
00:46:46,390 --> 00:46:51,186
I, uh... I can use some cheering up
from time to time myself, ma'am.

718
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:54,189
Being a cop isn't easy.

719
00:46:54,273 --> 00:46:55,858
You have a nice day now.

720
00:46:58,819 --> 00:47:02,072
<i>If there's anything I like
more than being mean...</i>

721
00:47:02,197 --> 00:47:04,700
<i>it's being sneaky.</i>

722
00:47:07,411 --> 00:47:09,288
<i>It's a trap!</i>

723
00:47:09,413 --> 00:47:12,958
<i>- Of course it's a trap!
- Gene?</i>

724
00:47:13,083 --> 00:47:15,460
<i>- Is that you?
- Affirmative!</i>

725
00:47:15,586 --> 00:47:17,671
<i>With the Planeteers
out of our way...</i>

726
00:47:17,754 --> 00:47:19,965
Chad left the TV on.

727
00:47:21,466 --> 00:47:24,970
<i>Man dares to go where
only cows have gone before.</i>

728
00:47:25,095 --> 00:47:28,515
<i>Bandini is the word
for fertilizer.</i>

729
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:32,895
Oh, my God! Chad,
what are you doing here?

730
00:47:32,978 --> 00:47:35,898
- Where's your dad?
- He had to go somewhere.

731
00:47:35,981 --> 00:47:38,192
He had to go somewhere
without you?

732
00:47:38,275 --> 00:47:39,985
He said he had
to do something.

733
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:42,779
- Something came up.
- Yeah.

734
00:47:42,863 --> 00:47:43,739
I'll bet it did.

735
00:47:43,822 --> 00:47:45,991
I'll bet something came up.

736
00:47:46,491 --> 00:47:48,076
So, what'd he say
about you?

737
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:50,996
He said we'll have
to do it some other time.

738
00:47:51,788 --> 00:47:53,457
Hey.

739
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,375
He's a son of a bitch.

740
00:47:56,627 --> 00:48:00,672
He's a son of a bitch.

741
00:48:14,603 --> 00:48:17,189
- Now?
- Bring in the...

742
00:48:26,573 --> 00:48:27,491
Jerry Kaiser.

743
00:48:27,574 --> 00:48:29,785
<i>- Hey, buddy, it's me.
- Hey.</i>

744
00:48:29,868 --> 00:48:32,788
Listen, I'm walking around
with a fuckin' serious chubby.

745
00:48:32,871 --> 00:48:34,540
Listen to what's going on.

746
00:48:34,623 --> 00:48:36,583
There's this girl
at school here...

747
00:48:36,625 --> 00:48:40,671
<i>She's 18, she's got a body to kill for,
beautiful face, and she asked me...</i>

748
00:48:40,712 --> 00:48:43,298
<i>- Why are you whispering?
- to do her body makeup for this...</i>

749
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:46,176
<i>I'm not whispering. I'm just...
I'm... I'm throaty. I'm excited.</i>

750
00:48:46,218 --> 00:48:50,347
<i>So I gotta do full-body makeup
on her. That takes an hour.</i>

751
00:48:50,430 --> 00:48:54,893
<i>That means I'm rubbing base
up and down the insides of her thighs...</i>

752
00:48:55,018 --> 00:48:56,895
like, right around her puddy...

753
00:48:56,937 --> 00:48:58,814
and I'm just like, "Oh, man!"

754
00:48:58,856 --> 00:49:02,359
I gotta run it up and down, up her...
on the inside of her elastic...

755
00:49:02,401 --> 00:49:04,528
and inside her perfect ass.

756
00:49:04,653 --> 00:49:07,072
I'm just, like...
I'm losing it, man.

757
00:49:07,155 --> 00:49:11,076
I was, like, rubbing some on her titties and
she looked at me and said, "What's your name?"

758
00:49:11,118 --> 00:49:12,953
I said, "My name is Bill."

759
00:49:13,036 --> 00:49:15,831
<i>She said, "Bill, you're
giving me a nipple boner."</i>

760
00:49:15,914 --> 00:49:17,875
<i>I said, "That's right."</i>

761
00:49:17,916 --> 00:49:21,336
<i>And I was just, like... I was about
to drop my brushes and just fuckin'...</i>

762
00:49:21,420 --> 00:49:25,007
<i>Oh! It was amazing.
What do you think about that, man?</i>

763
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:27,467
<i>Pretty amazing... Jerry?</i>

764
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:30,012
<i>Jerry? Kaiser?</i>

765
00:49:38,270 --> 00:49:41,190
Oh... Uh, d-did you
get a good grade?

766
00:49:41,273 --> 00:49:44,026
<i>Yeah, they gave me
an A-plus, baby.</i>

767
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:46,278
<i>- That's great.
- Why are you whispering?</i>

768
00:49:46,361 --> 00:49:48,280
<i>- Shh! Shh, shh.
- What? What are you doing?</i>

769
00:49:48,363 --> 00:49:49,823
I told you! I'm working.

770
00:49:49,865 --> 00:49:52,868
<i>You don't sound like you're... What are
you doing, waiting for some rich dame...</i>

771
00:49:52,910 --> 00:49:55,829
Okay, I gotta go.
I'll call you back later. Bye.

772
00:50:03,504 --> 00:50:05,714
I wish you wouldn't do that.

773
00:50:06,673 --> 00:50:09,176
You're not fooling me,
you know.

774
00:50:31,949 --> 00:50:35,452
Hey Stuart, nothing counts against first,
most or biggest unless we're all fishin', man.

775
00:50:35,536 --> 00:50:38,205
Yeah, I'm just settin' up
this new line. All right?

776
00:50:38,288 --> 00:50:41,124
What about somebody...
What about setting up the camp here?

777
00:50:41,166 --> 00:50:42,668
Somebody's gotta dig the hole.

778
00:50:42,751 --> 00:50:45,921
I'll do that! Just give me
a couple of minutes here!

779
00:50:46,004 --> 00:50:49,174
I'll help you.
Just let me take a leak first.

780
00:50:49,258 --> 00:50:52,886
Hey, don't piss
on any firewood!

781
00:50:52,970 --> 00:50:55,013
Yeah, and don't piss
in the water!

782
00:51:08,569 --> 00:51:10,195
Shit.

783
00:51:14,658 --> 00:51:17,035
What are you
pissin'in the water for, Vern?

784
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:19,454
I kinda like the way it sounds.

785
00:51:26,628 --> 00:51:27,588
Hey.

786
00:51:27,671 --> 00:51:29,923
Hey, Stuart, Gordon!

787
00:51:30,007 --> 00:51:31,550
Come here a second.

788
00:51:31,633 --> 00:51:35,470
What the hell is this?
Stuart, come here!

789
00:51:35,554 --> 00:51:37,306
Gordon, get over here!

790
00:51:37,389 --> 00:51:39,766
Holy Christ!
It's a dead body!

791
00:51:41,518 --> 00:51:44,062
Look at that. Jesus!

792
00:51:45,647 --> 00:51:47,774
Who do you think it is?

793
00:51:47,858 --> 00:51:51,361
- It's a dead body, isn't it?
- Yeah, it's a woman, huh?

794
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,238
She's dead, isn't she?

795
00:51:53,322 --> 00:51:55,324
Yeah, dead. I'll say.
Look at her.

796
00:51:55,407 --> 00:51:57,701
I wonder how.

797
00:51:58,368 --> 00:52:00,454
We gotta pull her out.

798
00:52:00,537 --> 00:52:02,164
Pull her out?
What are you, crazy?

799
00:52:02,247 --> 00:52:04,374
I don't think we should
touch her. Should we?

800
00:52:04,458 --> 00:52:07,252
No, we should call somebody.
I think we should call the police.

801
00:52:07,294 --> 00:52:10,380
I don't think we should touch
anything until we call somebody.

802
00:52:10,464 --> 00:52:15,969
Great idea. How we gonna do that? You got
a portable cellular phone or something?

803
00:52:16,053 --> 00:52:18,639
We can't just leave
her there, can we?

804
00:52:18,722 --> 00:52:21,308
Well, I know what
I'm gonna do.

805
00:52:21,391 --> 00:52:23,393
I'm gonna have a drink.

806
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:26,939
Uh, I think Vern
has the right idea.

807
00:52:27,022 --> 00:52:29,733
Hey, wait...
wait a minute!

808
00:52:32,069 --> 00:52:34,696
Why don't you go home,
get some rest?

809
00:52:34,780 --> 00:52:36,323
I'll call you if there's
any change.

810
00:52:36,406 --> 00:52:40,661
No, you go. I'll stay. You go rest up.
You've got things at the station.

811
00:52:40,744 --> 00:52:42,454
I'm all right.

812
00:52:42,829 --> 00:52:44,456
I could make some calls.

813
00:52:44,581 --> 00:52:46,708
Probably a good time.

814
00:52:46,792 --> 00:52:49,461
Look, I'll take the number
of the pay phone here.

815
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:51,213
- That's a good idea.
- Yeah.

816
00:52:51,296 --> 00:52:53,590
Sometimes it takes forever
to get through here.

817
00:52:53,674 --> 00:52:55,425
Uh, could you bring me some...

818
00:52:55,509 --> 00:52:57,135
shoes, some flats,
and a sweater?

819
00:52:57,219 --> 00:52:59,555
And maybe some mail?

820
00:52:59,638 --> 00:53:01,223
Magazines or something?

821
00:53:01,306 --> 00:53:02,975
It's gonna be all right.

822
00:53:03,100 --> 00:53:05,060
Bye.

823
00:53:18,365 --> 00:53:20,200
<i>- Marian?
- What? What's the matter?</i>

824
00:53:20,242 --> 00:53:23,245
Something horrible's happened.
This has been the worst day of my life.

825
00:53:23,287 --> 00:53:26,290
<i>Oh, my God.
What happened, Sherri? Tell me.</i>

826
00:53:26,373 --> 00:53:29,585
<i>- Suzy ran away.
- Oh, Jesus.</i>

827
00:53:29,668 --> 00:53:32,754
I thought you were gonna say something
happened to one of the kids, or to Gene.

828
00:53:32,838 --> 00:53:36,008
<i>- It's Gene's fault. He's the one who let him out.
- Oh, I'm sure you'll find her.</i>

829
00:53:36,091 --> 00:53:36,842
<i>- Him.
- Yeah.</i>

830
00:53:36,884 --> 00:53:40,262
I've been going up and down
the streets all day trying to find him.

831
00:53:40,345 --> 00:53:42,764
<i>- Kids are going nuts!
- Did you call the pound?</i>

832
00:53:42,806 --> 00:53:45,434
- Dad, Suzy's gone!
- I called everyone I could think of.

833
00:53:45,475 --> 00:53:49,646
- Honey, he's out running around. Don't worry.
- No, Daddy, he's really gone!

834
00:53:49,730 --> 00:53:52,858
Honey, he'll come back
when he's ready. Don't worry.

835
00:53:52,941 --> 00:53:55,027
Daddy, we looked and looked.

836
00:53:55,110 --> 00:54:00,282
Sweetheart, Suzy will be back
as soon as he gets hungry.

837
00:54:00,407 --> 00:54:03,493
Daddy, I want Suzy back!

838
00:54:03,577 --> 00:54:05,329
Daddy, we can't find Suzy!

839
00:54:05,370 --> 00:54:08,207
Listen to me, all of you.
Suzy will come back... sometime.

840
00:54:08,248 --> 00:54:12,586
- What if she doesn't?
- Well, then we'll have to get another dog.

841
00:54:12,669 --> 00:54:16,548
- We'll get a puppy this time. How's that?
- I don't want another dog. I want Suzy!

842
00:54:16,590 --> 00:54:18,884
I want Suzy!

843
00:54:18,967 --> 00:54:22,387
<i>- Tell me how much you want it.
- Put those on my side.</i>

844
00:54:22,471 --> 00:54:23,889
Why should I, Big?

845
00:54:23,972 --> 00:54:26,767
Still got three fingers
in your ass?

846
00:54:26,850 --> 00:54:29,269
Slut. I should make you
get an egg.

847
00:54:29,353 --> 00:54:32,189
You got an egg
in that refrigerator?

848
00:54:32,272 --> 00:54:34,191
No, you don't got an egg?

849
00:54:34,274 --> 00:54:37,319
- What about a candle?
- Candle.

850
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,738
What about the rubber bands
I told you about?

851
00:54:39,821 --> 00:54:42,699
I don't think you got 'em
tight enough. Snap 'em!

852
00:54:42,824 --> 00:54:45,035
<i>- Good.
- Okay. Geez!</i>

853
00:54:45,118 --> 00:54:47,704
Okay, take the rubber bands
off your dick.

854
00:54:47,788 --> 00:54:50,290
I'm gonna suck your dick now.

855
00:54:50,374 --> 00:54:52,125
I'm gonna introduce
your dick to my tonsils.

856
00:54:52,167 --> 00:54:54,711
Sit back down.
Joe, now!

857
00:54:54,795 --> 00:54:56,922
- Baby...
- How long you gonna stay on that phone, Lois?

858
00:54:57,005 --> 00:55:00,175
- Sit down. Look at the cards.
- Say, "Please, mistress."

859
00:55:00,259 --> 00:55:02,010
<i>- Sit down.
- I didn't tell you to come!</i>

860
00:55:02,094 --> 00:55:04,763
<i>So tell me, how did it feel?</i>

861
00:55:04,847 --> 00:55:08,517
Next time I'm gonna make you
get a Q-Tip with some aftershave...

862
00:55:08,600 --> 00:55:11,687
and I'm gonna make you
stick it up that dick of yours.

863
00:55:11,812 --> 00:55:14,606
3:30 Wednesday.
Call me, bitch.

864
00:55:15,732 --> 00:55:17,693
<i>Bend the card!</i>

865
00:55:21,363 --> 00:55:23,365
They don't want another dog.

866
00:55:23,448 --> 00:55:24,950
- Well, neither do I.
- Neither do I.

867
00:55:25,033 --> 00:55:26,660
- Neither do I.
- Neither do I!

868
00:55:26,743 --> 00:55:28,370
- Neither do I!
- I! I! I!

869
00:55:28,495 --> 00:55:30,414
I!

870
00:55:32,541 --> 00:55:35,669
I don't even see
what the difference is.

871
00:55:35,752 --> 00:55:38,755
They're not even gonna know
who Suzy is in a week.

872
00:55:38,839 --> 00:55:43,719
Let's take the kids, put them in the car,
drive around and see if anybody's seen him.

873
00:55:43,802 --> 00:55:46,763
- Can't do it. I got plans.
- Oh, Gene, come on!

874
00:55:46,847 --> 00:55:48,515
Sherri, I told you
a week and a half ago...

875
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:52,978
I got the leadership...
council thing on the... crack kids.

876
00:55:55,314 --> 00:55:58,442
What you should do is,
you should go out with the kids...

877
00:55:58,525 --> 00:56:00,986
put up some signs, offer
a reward... not too much.

878
00:56:01,028 --> 00:56:03,947
- Remember, it's a dog.
- Who's Claire "The Clown" Kane?

879
00:56:05,324 --> 00:56:06,742
What are you doing
looking in my pockets?

880
00:56:06,825 --> 00:56:10,662
What are you doing with her
driver's license and telephone number?

881
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:14,875
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.

882
00:56:14,958 --> 00:56:18,712
Claire Kane, a.k.a.
"The Clown"...

883
00:56:18,795 --> 00:56:21,590
is a bunco artist
wanted in three states.

884
00:56:21,715 --> 00:56:26,386
I have her phone number because I'm
running a sting operation. Now you know.

885
00:56:26,470 --> 00:56:28,388
And now, unfortunately...

886
00:56:28,472 --> 00:56:32,643
I have compromised your safety
and the children's safety.

887
00:56:32,726 --> 00:56:34,561
Are you happy now?

888
00:56:41,985 --> 00:56:44,655
<i>There is a...
a hard, heavy physicality...</i>

889
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:46,365
<i>in my new paintings.</i>

890
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:50,369
<i>In part because I've executed them
on large panels of wood...</i>

891
00:56:50,494 --> 00:56:52,955
<i>but I'd say that
they're tempered by the...</i>

892
00:56:53,038 --> 00:56:55,374
- Oh. Sorry.
- Sorry.

893
00:56:55,457 --> 00:56:58,085
Um, tempered by the
ephemeral use of color.

894
00:56:58,168 --> 00:57:00,754
You could almost say that
it's beyond natural color.

895
00:57:00,838 --> 00:57:02,471
<i>What are they about?</i>

896
00:57:02,506 --> 00:57:04,508
Well...

897
00:57:04,591 --> 00:57:06,426
I think they're about seeing...

898
00:57:06,510 --> 00:57:09,555
and the responsibility
that comes with that.

899
00:57:09,638 --> 00:57:12,182
<i>- Okay.
- And call next week.</i>

900
00:57:12,307 --> 00:57:15,519
<i>- Thanks. Thank you very much.
- Bye.</i>

901
00:57:15,644 --> 00:57:17,354
Bye-bye.

902
00:57:18,272 --> 00:57:20,607
Who was that? Sherri?

903
00:57:20,691 --> 00:57:23,527
No, that was David...

904
00:57:23,610 --> 00:57:25,612
at the gallery.

905
00:57:25,737 --> 00:57:27,865
Oh. David at the gallery.

906
00:57:27,948 --> 00:57:30,075
I'm hoping to get
a show there.

907
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:35,289
Is this "David at the gallery" going to be
another Mitchell Anderson in our lives?

908
00:57:35,372 --> 00:57:36,665
What's that supposed to mean?

909
00:57:36,790 --> 00:57:40,627
Well, that's the sort of stuff you two
used to blather on about, isn't it?

910
00:57:40,711 --> 00:57:42,921
What are you talking about?

911
00:57:43,005 --> 00:57:47,426
The lousy painter. The one who never
sold anything. Mitchell Anderson.

912
00:57:49,261 --> 00:57:53,390
Just because he never sold anything
doesn't mean he was a lousy painter.

913
00:57:53,473 --> 00:57:54,892
So you've said.

914
00:57:54,975 --> 00:57:56,602
Well, it's true.

915
00:57:56,727 --> 00:57:58,979
You know,
scientifically speaking, Marian...

916
00:57:59,062 --> 00:58:02,733
there's no such thing as
"beyond natural color".

917
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,652
<i>I don't know why we're sittin'
around here actin'like it was our fault.</i>

918
00:58:05,736 --> 00:58:07,112
<i>We didn't have
anything to do with it.</i>

919
00:58:07,196 --> 00:58:09,990
<i>Yeah. Suppose we'd never
come up here in the first place.</i>

920
00:58:10,073 --> 00:58:12,117
When would she have
been found? Maybe never.

921
00:58:12,201 --> 00:58:14,286
Nothing we can do to help.

922
00:58:14,369 --> 00:58:18,707
She must have been murdered.
I mean, she's naked and everything.

923
00:58:18,790 --> 00:58:22,085
Nothing we're gonna do
about it tonight, anyway.

924
00:58:22,169 --> 00:58:23,795
Suppose it floats away.

925
00:58:23,879 --> 00:58:26,006
Then it's out of our hands.

926
00:58:26,089 --> 00:58:29,051
Maybe that's what we oughta do...
kick it loose and let somebody else find it.

927
00:58:29,134 --> 00:58:32,095
Ah, I don't know.
I think...

928
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,764
I think we oughta tie it up
so it won't float away.

929
00:58:33,847 --> 00:58:37,434
Then we can, uh, you know,
deal with it in the morning.

930
00:58:37,518 --> 00:58:38,769
What do you say about that?

931
00:58:38,852 --> 00:58:42,397
I say we got 2 hours of prime trout
time left. That's what we oughta deal with.

932
00:58:42,439 --> 00:58:45,651
Hey, let's take a vote.

933
00:58:45,776 --> 00:58:47,528
All right by me.

934
00:58:48,028 --> 00:58:50,656
Fish now,
or deal with the body.

935
00:58:50,781 --> 00:58:52,658
I say fish now.

936
00:58:52,783 --> 00:58:55,953
Suppose the current
takes it away.

937
00:58:56,036 --> 00:58:57,746
Then it's not our problem.

938
00:58:59,122 --> 00:59:02,584
The Planeteers are trying to save
the planet and the environment.

939
00:59:02,668 --> 00:59:05,796
Uh, they're all
wonderful characters.

940
00:59:05,879 --> 00:59:09,007
- Tell Gene where he comes from.
- The tropical rain forest.

941
00:59:09,091 --> 00:59:10,926
- This one?
- This is Ma-Ti.

942
00:59:11,009 --> 00:59:14,429
And his power is heart.
Let's see. Where is his ring?

943
00:59:14,513 --> 00:59:15,514
They all come with little...

944
00:59:15,597 --> 00:59:18,225
Stormy did this to me on purpose.
I'm gonna kill him.

945
00:59:18,308 --> 00:59:22,312
Let's say he points his ring
at, maybe, Earth, and...

946
00:59:22,396 --> 00:59:24,648
Chad, you know what?

947
00:59:24,773 --> 00:59:27,776
I think that it was really nice
that Gene brought us here tonight...

948
00:59:27,860 --> 00:59:29,820
and I think we should
say thank you.

949
00:59:29,945 --> 00:59:33,448
- Don't you?
- Mommy, can I go to the bathroom, please?

950
00:59:33,532 --> 00:59:34,992
Yeah.

951
00:59:36,118 --> 00:59:39,788
- Wait. Where is it?
- Uh, excuse me, miss.

952
00:59:39,872 --> 00:59:41,623
Where's the restroom?

953
00:59:41,748 --> 00:59:43,625
- For him? I'll take him.
- Thanks.

954
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:45,711
Come on. I'll show you.

955
01:00:00,184 --> 01:00:01,310
What's that?

956
01:00:01,393 --> 01:00:03,478
- What?
- That.

957
01:00:05,564 --> 01:00:07,733
Happy birthday.

958
01:00:07,816 --> 01:00:10,277
What is it?
An alarm clock?

959
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,571
It's pretty.

960
01:00:15,699 --> 01:00:18,118
My marriage is breaking up.

961
01:00:18,202 --> 01:00:19,703
Oh, honey, really?

962
01:00:19,786 --> 01:00:21,330
Really.

963
01:00:21,455 --> 01:00:24,333
I can't think of
anything but you.

964
01:00:24,458 --> 01:00:26,668
Not at work,

965
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:29,338
not about the trial.
Just you.

966
01:00:29,963 --> 01:00:31,423
I think I'm, uh...

967
01:00:32,633 --> 01:00:35,052
I think I'm, uh,
getting serious.

968
01:00:35,135 --> 01:00:38,430
Oh, honey, I wanna be
with you too.

969
01:00:47,523 --> 01:00:49,900
<i>- Hello?
- Mrs. Finnigan, please.</i>

970
01:00:49,983 --> 01:00:52,027
Uh, sorry, she's
not here right now.

971
01:00:52,110 --> 01:00:54,321
<i>- Who's this?
- This is Mr. Bitkower.</i>

972
01:00:54,404 --> 01:00:58,325
<i>She placed an order today, and I just wanted
to make sure I was clear about what she wanted.</i>

973
01:00:58,408 --> 01:01:00,118
<i>Her drawing's a little messy.</i>

974
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:03,705
Well, she isn't here right now.
Call her back next week. All right?

975
01:01:20,264 --> 01:01:21,598
Hello.

976
01:01:21,682 --> 01:01:23,225
<i>I don't appreciate
being hung up on...</i>

977
01:01:23,267 --> 01:01:25,060
<i>when I'm calling
about your order.</i>

978
01:01:25,143 --> 01:01:28,564
<i>I need to know whether Mrs. Finnigan
wanted a bat or a mitt. May I speak to her?</i>

979
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:33,110
No, you may not. Whatever it is,
just cancel it and stop calling here.

980
01:01:33,193 --> 01:01:34,319
Now, we've got
a problem here.

981
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:37,656
We don't need the line tied up
with unimportant stuff!

982
01:01:49,960 --> 01:01:51,295
<i>Either you give me
an answer now...</i>

983
01:01:51,378 --> 01:01:54,548
Look, fuck you, asshole.
Fuck you!

984
01:01:58,468 --> 01:01:59,511
Jesus.

985
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,438
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

986
01:02:16,195 --> 01:02:18,780
All right, tomorrow night
we'll get a motel room.

987
01:02:18,906 --> 01:02:20,574
- When?
- Tomorrow night.

988
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:23,076
Oh, no, I can't.
I'm going away for the weekend.

989
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:25,537
- What?
- Goin' to Tahoe, see my sister.

990
01:02:25,579 --> 01:02:29,958
- Tahoe? When did that get decided on?
- I don't know. Last week.

991
01:02:30,042 --> 01:02:32,961
Your sister? Thought your
sister lived in Michigan.

992
01:02:33,045 --> 01:02:34,087
That's Phyllis. This is Bunny.

993
01:02:34,129 --> 01:02:36,924
- Bunny lives in Tahoe.
- Bunny? Who's Bunny?

994
01:02:37,007 --> 01:02:38,091
You never mentioned
her before.

995
01:02:38,133 --> 01:02:40,511
- Yes, I did. She's my half sister.
- Half sister?

996
01:02:40,552 --> 01:02:44,348
And besi... Gene, you were always
with your family on the weekend.

997
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,351
How was I supposed to know
you could get away?

998
01:02:48,852 --> 01:02:51,772
Oh, well...

999
01:02:51,855 --> 01:02:54,816
I don't know what
to think, Betty.

1000
01:02:54,942 --> 01:02:56,818
Huh.

1001
01:03:00,155 --> 01:03:02,241
So, is B...
Who is Bunny?

1002
01:03:02,324 --> 01:03:03,534
- Bunny...
- Bunny... Who's...

1003
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:06,870
- Bunny is my half-stepsister.
- These your mother's kids or your father's kids?

1004
01:03:06,954 --> 01:03:08,330
- My dad's wife's kid.
- Oh, yeah.

1005
01:03:08,413 --> 01:03:10,499
We have been planning to
get together for over a year.

1006
01:03:10,582 --> 01:03:12,501
- Oh, yeah? Well, what's she do in Tahoe?
- What?

1007
01:03:12,584 --> 01:03:15,045
What does she do in Tahoe?

1008
01:03:15,170 --> 01:03:17,881
She work? Is she married?

1009
01:03:18,006 --> 01:03:21,301
- Tahoe's a fancy place to live, you know.
- Gene, stop this.

1010
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:25,639
I'm going away for a few days
to visit my sister.

1011
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:29,101
Don't try to make me feel
guilty about nothing.

1012
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:31,103
You're making mountains
out of molehills.

1013
01:03:31,186 --> 01:03:33,897
- Come on...
- Shh. Kid's back.

1014
01:03:34,022 --> 01:03:35,941
There's this really
neat camera up front.

1015
01:03:36,024 --> 01:03:37,734
- It's not a real camera.
- Did you find the bathroom okay?

1016
01:03:37,818 --> 01:03:40,070
Uh, yeah. There's a man
throwing up in there.

1017
01:03:40,153 --> 01:03:42,823
- Oh, my God. How awful. Is he all right?
- Chad.

1018
01:03:42,906 --> 01:03:45,826
- I don't know.
- You going to visit Aunt Bunny this weekend?

1019
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:48,203
How about those peas?
Let's eat up some of those peas.

1020
01:03:48,287 --> 01:03:49,705
Bunny?

1021
01:03:49,788 --> 01:03:51,790
He's too young to
remember Bunny, okay?

1022
01:03:51,874 --> 01:03:54,459
Does not remember Bunny.
Eat 'em up.

1023
01:03:54,585 --> 01:03:58,881
Anyway, it squirts water...
It looks like a real camera. Please?

1024
01:03:58,964 --> 01:04:02,050
I really want it. Come on.
Daddy would buy it for me.

1025
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:14,354
You boys have obviously not heard
of the Joe Robbins legend, have you?

1026
01:04:14,438 --> 01:04:16,732
- What can I get you, pal?
- Same, Jay.

1027
01:04:16,815 --> 01:04:19,234
Are you laughin' at me?

1028
01:04:19,318 --> 01:04:21,904
- No one was laughin'at you.
- Go ahead.

1029
01:04:25,324 --> 01:04:27,951
Next to my cell,
a big Spanish brother.

1030
01:04:28,076 --> 01:04:31,747
6'4", 6'5", Eddie Valdez.
We called him "Big Ed."

1031
01:04:31,872 --> 01:04:34,708
I said, "Big Ed, yo, listen.
Don't fuck with me."

1032
01:04:34,791 --> 01:04:38,879
Cat fuck with me. I get my hands
on about 30 feet of rope.

1033
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,881
Now, you may wonder
where I get rope in prison.

1034
01:04:40,964 --> 01:04:44,551
Like I told you, I'm Joe Robbins.
Inside or out.

1035
01:04:46,762 --> 01:04:48,639
It's all in my cell.

1036
01:04:49,056 --> 01:04:50,641
How you doin'?

1037
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:52,809
Good.

1038
01:04:52,935 --> 01:04:56,772
<i>Here's a song I want
to sing for myself.</i>

1039
01:04:56,855 --> 01:04:59,191
I lay low, like a black cat
in the shadows.

1040
01:05:00,526 --> 01:05:05,155
And I wait for this big Spanish
motherfucker to come moseyin' down.

1041
01:05:05,280 --> 01:05:07,282
As soon as he
crossed my path, boom.

1042
01:05:07,407 --> 01:05:10,452
<i>- I'm tired
- Flies on shit...</i>

1043
01:05:10,577 --> 01:05:12,704
<i>So tired</i>

1044
01:05:12,788 --> 01:05:17,251
Around his neck so quick, then
pushed him over the fucking guardrail.

1045
01:05:17,376 --> 01:05:21,171
The rope snaps tight.
His fuckin' head pops off.

1046
01:05:21,296 --> 01:05:24,383
His body keeps plummeting
downward, and he falls...

1047
01:05:24,508 --> 01:05:27,386
neck hole first
into the ground.

1048
01:05:27,511 --> 01:05:29,471
My point is...

1049
01:05:29,596 --> 01:05:31,473
Big Ed pissed me off
just a little bit.

1050
01:05:31,598 --> 01:05:34,726
You wanna keep it down
so the lady can sing?

1051
01:05:34,810 --> 01:05:36,436
Wait.

1052
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,565
Hey, come on.

1053
01:05:39,648 --> 01:05:43,277
- I made a mistake, all right?
- Yeah, you made a mistake.

1054
01:05:45,696 --> 01:05:47,322
- See, my shit's live.
- Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

1055
01:05:47,406 --> 01:05:50,492
Where was I?
I was tellin' a story here.

1056
01:05:50,617 --> 01:05:54,162
<i>But I won't be sorry</i>

1057
01:05:55,664 --> 01:05:57,958
<i>If you won't be</i>

1058
01:06:00,169 --> 01:06:04,006
<i>And I don't want your pity</i>

1059
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:09,219
<i>Or your sympathy</i>

1060
01:06:11,471 --> 01:06:14,975
<i>But with $45</i>

1061
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:16,977
<i>I can make it
- Hi.</i>

1062
01:06:18,562 --> 01:06:21,398
<i>- Hi. How's he doin'?
- You wait and see</i>

1063
01:06:21,523 --> 01:06:23,859
He's still asleep.
He really hasn't moved.

1064
01:06:26,904 --> 01:06:29,198
What's, uh...
What's all this?

1065
01:06:29,323 --> 01:06:32,242
I don't know.
Dr. Wyman ordered it.

1066
01:06:33,535 --> 01:06:35,495
Any change?

1067
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:39,458
- Well, he says the numbers look good.
- Yeah?

1068
01:06:39,541 --> 01:06:43,462
I don't think it's good he keeps sleeping
like this. I don't think that's a good sign.

1069
01:06:43,545 --> 01:06:45,714
He's okay.
He's gonna be all right.

1070
01:06:45,839 --> 01:06:47,716
He'll wake up soon.

1071
01:06:48,759 --> 01:06:52,554
I talked to, uh, Bob Winslow.
He's in Hawaii.

1072
01:06:52,638 --> 01:06:56,183
And he knows this... this Wyman fellow.
He says we're in good hands.

1073
01:06:56,308 --> 01:06:58,936
- He knows what's what.
- Good.

1074
01:06:59,978 --> 01:07:02,064
I'm gonna go get
a cup of coffee.

1075
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:04,066
- You stay with Casey.
- Okay.

1076
01:07:07,861 --> 01:07:10,739
Oh, God.
Why won't he wake up?

1077
01:07:11,114 --> 01:07:14,618
<i>It isn't as if</i>

1078
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:19,248
<i>I was just anybody</i>

1079
01:07:20,290 --> 01:07:24,586
<i>On Broadway I danced</i>

1080
01:07:24,711 --> 01:07:27,214
<i>For that senator</i>

1081
01:07:29,424 --> 01:07:34,137
<i>They know me in London</i>

1082
01:07:34,263 --> 01:07:38,100
<i>And they know me in Paris</i>

1083
01:07:39,601 --> 01:07:42,980
<i>- Hmm.
- I'm only talking</i>

1084
01:07:43,105 --> 01:07:47,526
<i>'Cause you looked like
you needed a friend</i>

1085
01:07:54,116 --> 01:07:55,826
Here. Gimme that. Gimme that.
I'll tie it around the wrist.

1086
01:07:55,909 --> 01:07:58,245
Never thought I'd be
doing anything like this.

1087
01:07:58,328 --> 01:08:00,122
- Yeah, me neither.
- What's she feel like, Stuart?

1088
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:03,292
- Oh, God.
- Feel her tits?

1089
01:08:03,375 --> 01:08:05,294
You know, I just realized...

1090
01:08:05,377 --> 01:08:07,880
there's probably a thousand guys in L.A.
Who'd be ballin' her right now.

1091
01:08:07,963 --> 01:08:09,423
Will you shut up!

1092
01:08:09,506 --> 01:08:12,092
I'm just trying to lighten things up
a little bit, all right?

1093
01:08:12,176 --> 01:08:14,845
Yeah, let's get the hell out of here.
Come on. Tie that up.

1094
01:08:14,970 --> 01:08:17,639
Man, if you'd have told me I was
fooling around with a dead body up here...

1095
01:08:17,723 --> 01:08:20,475
- I'd have told you you were full of shit.
- Yeah. Okay, let's go.

1096
01:09:24,122 --> 01:09:28,544
- Stop stealing.
- Bill, God. What'd ya sneak... Bill.

1097
01:09:28,627 --> 01:09:29,837
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me.

1098
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:31,547
- You want to make up?
- Why did you sneak up on me?

1099
01:09:31,588 --> 01:09:34,299
- What time are your classes, huh?
- I'm ditching.

1100
01:09:34,383 --> 01:09:35,968
I wanna see you.
It's true.

1101
01:09:36,051 --> 01:09:38,011
- You've got to go to class.
- Are you snoopin' around?

1102
01:09:38,095 --> 01:09:41,682
- All you're supposed to do is just feed the fish.
- Look at this one, though. Look at this one.

1103
01:09:41,765 --> 01:09:43,725
- Look it, that's a lionfish, honey.
- Oh, really?

1104
01:09:43,851 --> 01:09:47,187
- He is. Go on. You should go to classes.
- Okay.

1105
01:09:47,271 --> 01:09:49,898
- These are strange people, honey.
- I know.

1106
01:09:50,023 --> 01:09:53,110
- What's in here?
- Bill... Don't snoop, Bill.

1107
01:09:53,235 --> 01:09:54,820
- Don't snoop.
- Why not?

1108
01:09:54,903 --> 01:09:56,822
You respect their privacy.

1109
01:09:56,905 --> 01:09:59,241
Why not snoop around with
their "Hot Fudge" videos out?

1110
01:09:59,324 --> 01:10:01,869
Their sick, dirty pornography.

1111
01:10:01,994 --> 01:10:04,329
These people are creepy.
They're creepy.

1112
01:10:04,413 --> 01:10:05,956
Use an ashtray
when you smoke in here.

1113
01:10:06,081 --> 01:10:08,041
- That's a rule. That's a rule.
- Why? There's no...

1114
01:10:08,125 --> 01:10:10,919
- Oh, you brought my ashtray.
- Our ashtray.

1115
01:10:11,003 --> 01:10:13,255
See, on the list it says
it's good for the carpet.

1116
01:10:13,338 --> 01:10:16,008
- Oh, Bill.
- How long are these creeps gonna be out of town?

1117
01:10:16,091 --> 01:10:18,010
A month.

1118
01:10:19,052 --> 01:10:21,388
You know what?

1119
01:10:21,471 --> 01:10:23,807
- I think we should move in here.
- No.

1120
01:10:23,932 --> 01:10:25,893
- And really... Yeah!
- We can't do that.

1121
01:10:26,018 --> 01:10:28,437
It's the only respectful
thing to do.

1122
01:10:28,562 --> 01:10:30,272
- Nah, that wouldn't be right.
- Why not?

1123
01:10:30,397 --> 01:10:32,024
'Cause that's not right, Bill.

1124
01:10:34,109 --> 01:10:36,320
- Okay.
- She's right.

1125
01:10:36,445 --> 01:10:39,281
- So, I'll see you around 6:00, okay?
- Yeah. I'll come home.

1126
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:45,662
But you know we're gonna do
the right thing in their bed tonight, right?

1127
01:10:45,787 --> 01:10:47,915
Oh, uh... I don't know.

1128
01:11:06,475 --> 01:11:08,227
Whoo-hoo!

1129
01:11:10,938 --> 01:11:12,814
Hey, Vern!

1130
01:11:14,233 --> 01:11:15,859
- Hey!
- Look at here!

1131
01:11:15,943 --> 01:11:18,820
- How big?
- It's about three or four pounds.

1132
01:11:18,904 --> 01:11:21,865
I got it!
Hey! Didn't I tell ya?

1133
01:11:21,990 --> 01:11:25,285
It's Moby fuckin' Dick here!
Look at this!

1134
01:11:26,370 --> 01:11:28,330
Come on, baby. Come on!

1135
01:11:28,413 --> 01:11:30,457
Come to Papa.

1136
01:11:56,859 --> 01:12:00,320
How long are you gonna do that?
Do you know what time it is?

1137
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:10,956
Do you have to play so loud?

1138
01:12:16,044 --> 01:12:21,800
That's Chick's fault. He was always
hot for the string players.

1139
01:12:21,884 --> 01:12:23,385
I always thought
they were weird.

1140
01:12:23,468 --> 01:12:27,014
- String players and girl singers.
- How come...

1141
01:12:27,097 --> 01:12:29,057
That was his weakness.

1142
01:12:29,933 --> 01:12:32,186
I don't remember him.

1143
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:36,481
Well, mainly because
he wasn't around that much.

1144
01:12:36,565 --> 01:12:40,736
Hell, he exploded
when you were barely six.

1145
01:12:40,819 --> 01:12:43,822
Get me another
"Veggie Mary," will ya?

1146
01:12:44,323 --> 01:12:46,450
Talk... Talk more about Dad.

1147
01:12:46,533 --> 01:12:48,535
Not much more to tell, baby.

1148
01:12:48,619 --> 01:12:52,122
He was a prick.
That's the long and the short of it.

1149
01:12:53,081 --> 01:12:55,542
- Wanna get the door?
- Mommy, Daddy's here.

1150
01:12:59,421 --> 01:13:01,298
- Hey!
- Go to your room.

1151
01:13:01,381 --> 01:13:04,510
Finish up what I told you to do.
What do you want?

1152
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:06,678
I came to get
my mother's clock.

1153
01:13:06,762 --> 01:13:09,389
- What's wrong with you?
- Well, it is my clock, isn't it?

1154
01:13:10,766 --> 01:13:13,894
- Finish. Do what I told you.
- Oh, Betty.

1155
01:13:13,977 --> 01:13:15,938
What you did to your son
is unforgivable.

1156
01:13:16,063 --> 01:13:19,525
What, he didn't tell you Daddy's been
flying nights, bombin' the dirty medflies?

1157
01:13:20,776 --> 01:13:23,153
Get it and get out.

1158
01:13:23,278 --> 01:13:26,490
- This house is half mine, you know.
- Liar!

1159
01:13:26,615 --> 01:13:29,451
- I pay for it.
- Take what you think is yours...

1160
01:13:29,535 --> 01:13:31,286
and get out of my life!

1161
01:13:31,411 --> 01:13:34,873
New sheets.
Jungle theme, huh?

1162
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:36,708
- Goin' somewhere?
- Yeah, I am.

1163
01:13:36,792 --> 01:13:40,212
- Yeah? Where?
- None of your business.

1164
01:13:40,295 --> 01:13:43,841
Your... condom
file drawer is open.

1165
01:13:43,966 --> 01:13:45,717
Going with Gene?

1166
01:13:45,801 --> 01:13:50,138
Going somewhere
with Jungle Gene?

1167
01:13:50,264 --> 01:13:52,891
Get your fucking clock
and get out of here!

1168
01:14:14,580 --> 01:14:15,831
Oh!

1169
01:14:33,432 --> 01:14:36,018
<i>Goddamn it, Zoe!
What was that?</i>

1170
01:15:07,841 --> 01:15:09,259
Thank you.

1171
01:15:09,343 --> 01:15:12,721
- What was the patient's name?
- Eh, the boy's name is... is Finnigan.

1172
01:15:12,804 --> 01:15:16,600
Uh, h-his father is
Howard Finnigan, if that helps.

1173
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:18,519
Excuse me.
I'm Claire the Clown.

1174
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,604
I'm here to do a party
in the pediatrics ward.

1175
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:23,690
- Yes. I'll call the head nurse.
- Uh... excuse me. Uh, Claire?

1176
01:15:23,774 --> 01:15:26,818
- Do you do tricks in your, uh, routine?
- Yes. Uh-huh.

1177
01:15:26,902 --> 01:15:29,488
Oh, I've got something to show you.
I brought this stuff along.

1178
01:15:29,530 --> 01:15:31,990
I wanted to do this trick
for my grandson.

1179
01:15:32,032 --> 01:15:33,492
He's a patient in there.

1180
01:15:33,575 --> 01:15:36,078
I used to do this for his dad
when he was just a kid.

1181
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:39,706
Now, I am going to move
that egg from this glass...

1182
01:15:39,790 --> 01:15:43,377
into that glass
without touching it.

1183
01:15:43,502 --> 01:15:45,921
You say to me, "How could you
possibly do that?" Go ahead.

1184
01:15:46,004 --> 01:15:47,840
How could you possibly do that?

1185
01:15:47,881 --> 01:15:49,925
I'm going to show you.

1186
01:15:51,051 --> 01:15:54,429
I-Is that a touch of terrific?
It's yours!

1187
01:15:54,555 --> 01:15:57,724
Thanks. It's good for bars,
but I don't think it's a children's trick.

1188
01:15:57,766 --> 01:16:00,102
<i>- Claire.
- I'm here.</i>

1189
01:16:00,185 --> 01:16:02,604
The Finnigan boy's
in Intensive Care, sir.

1190
01:16:02,729 --> 01:16:06,316
- But I think that's his mother over there.
- Oh.

1191
01:16:06,441 --> 01:16:08,610
Dr. Wyman, it's Claire.

1192
01:16:08,735 --> 01:16:11,446
Claire Kane. Remember?
From the concert.

1193
01:16:11,572 --> 01:16:16,368
Um... This is what I do.
I'm doing a chil... I'm... I'm a clown.

1194
01:16:16,451 --> 01:16:18,704
I'm really looking forward
to dinner.

1195
01:16:18,787 --> 01:16:21,290
- Stuart's bringing the fish. Remember?
- Right.

1196
01:16:22,749 --> 01:16:25,043
- Who's that?
- I have no idea.

1197
01:16:27,045 --> 01:16:30,090
Ann? Ann Finnigan?

1198
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:33,260
Oh, good. The girl said that
she thought you were...

1199
01:16:33,385 --> 01:16:36,138
Yeah, I just didn't want to walk
into the boy's room alone, you know.

1200
01:16:36,263 --> 01:16:38,849
- Do I... Do...
- Oh, I'm sorry. Paul Finnigan, huh?

1201
01:16:38,932 --> 01:16:40,642
Howard's dad.

1202
01:16:40,767 --> 01:16:42,644
- Howard's dad?
- Yeah. Yeah. Howard's dad.

1203
01:16:42,769 --> 01:16:44,646
I was just passing
through L.A., and I, uh...

1204
01:16:44,771 --> 01:16:47,566
Well, actually, I've been living
in Riverside for a number of years.

1205
01:16:47,649 --> 01:16:50,694
Olla filled me in on what
was going on around here.

1206
01:16:50,819 --> 01:16:52,905
- Olla?
- Yeah, Olla.

1207
01:16:52,988 --> 01:16:55,532
How's the boy?
Well, he has a head injury...

1208
01:16:55,657 --> 01:16:58,076
a little clot and some swelling.

1209
01:16:58,160 --> 01:17:02,039
But they don't have to operate. We're
a little worried because he won't wake up.

1210
01:17:02,122 --> 01:17:03,874
- Oh.
- So you're Howard's dad?

1211
01:17:03,957 --> 01:17:07,294
- Yeah, yeah.
- Well, it was very thoughtful of you to come by.

1212
01:17:07,419 --> 01:17:09,588
Yeah. Oh, hey, hey.
I was gonna come by...

1213
01:17:09,671 --> 01:17:11,673
but I just heard about this now.

1214
01:17:11,798 --> 01:17:15,677
You know, I've never even seen him.
You know, uh, Kevin... It's, uh...

1215
01:17:15,761 --> 01:17:19,431
- Casey.
- Casey, yeah. Yeah, Casey.

1216
01:17:19,515 --> 01:17:22,434
- Howard's doing real good, isn't he?
- Well, we're...

1217
01:17:22,518 --> 01:17:26,563
We're very worried. You know,
he... he... he won't wake up.

1218
01:17:26,688 --> 01:17:32,069
Uh, but other than that, he doesn't
have any broken bones, so...

1219
01:17:32,528 --> 01:17:35,489
<i>No, I mean, Howard's
doing real good.</i>

1220
01:17:35,572 --> 01:17:38,575
- Oh.
- The TV editorials, you know.

1221
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:40,577
Yeah.

1222
01:18:00,389 --> 01:18:01,515
<i>- Hello?
- Who's this?</i>

1223
01:18:01,640 --> 01:18:03,809
<i>- Well, who's this?
- Let me speak to Betty.</i>

1224
01:18:03,892 --> 01:18:07,521
- Give me that phone.
- No, she's not dressed right now.

1225
01:18:07,604 --> 01:18:09,565
- Give it to me!
- Honey, put your panties on!

1226
01:18:10,357 --> 01:18:11,859
<i>- Who is this?
- Give me that phone! Who is it?</i>

1227
01:18:11,942 --> 01:18:14,736
Give it to me! Give it to me!

1228
01:18:14,820 --> 01:18:17,573
- Have a nice weekend!
- Get out of here!

1229
01:18:17,656 --> 01:18:19,992
Hello! Hello!

1230
01:18:24,955 --> 01:18:27,207
Hello? Betty Weathers.

1231
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:47,060
- Take it easy with him.
- What is it?

1232
01:18:47,144 --> 01:18:50,939
They're gonna operate again.
He's gonna be all right. Thank you.

1233
01:18:51,023 --> 01:18:53,525
- Now, don't bump him!
- Keep that hallway clear.

1234
01:18:53,609 --> 01:18:57,487
You're not gonna believe this,
but your father's out there.

1235
01:18:57,571 --> 01:18:59,281
My father?
You mean Paul?

1236
01:18:59,364 --> 01:19:00,824
Yes!

1237
01:19:00,949 --> 01:19:02,784
He was always
such a good kid.

1238
01:19:02,868 --> 01:19:07,289
- Who's Olla?
- Olla? That's my aunt.

1239
01:19:07,414 --> 01:19:10,250
That's who your father
talked to.

1240
01:19:10,334 --> 01:19:11,793
What happened
to the Willis boy?

1241
01:19:11,835 --> 01:19:14,004
He's in surgery.

1242
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:17,382
So, when did you last...

1243
01:19:19,218 --> 01:19:20,886
So, when did you
talk to him last?

1244
01:19:20,969 --> 01:19:23,430
He lives in Riverside.
That's not that far away.

1245
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:27,100
I don't know. This is as much of a
urprise to me as it is to anybody.

1246
01:19:27,184 --> 01:19:30,062
I mean, I haven't seen him
in years. I haven't...

1247
01:19:30,145 --> 01:19:32,481
talked to him since
the divorce.

1248
01:19:33,899 --> 01:19:36,527
I wonder why he picked now.

1249
01:19:41,740 --> 01:19:45,035
- Hi, Dad.
- Hey, son. Ah!

1250
01:19:45,160 --> 01:19:49,414
Oh, you are lookin' good.

1251
01:19:49,498 --> 01:19:52,459
Hey, oh, I'm sorry to hear
about what happened to, um, uh...

1252
01:19:52,543 --> 01:19:55,838
- Casey.
- Yeah, the kid. Oh, I'm sure he's gonna be fine.

1253
01:19:55,921 --> 01:19:57,464
- We're praying.
- Yeah.

1254
01:19:57,548 --> 01:20:01,385
- You, uh... You... You've met Ann?
- Oh, sure. Yeah. Yeah, sure.

1255
01:20:01,510 --> 01:20:05,347
I seen you a couple of times on
television there. You're a real authority.

1256
01:20:05,430 --> 01:20:08,225
- Huh? Huh?
- Yeah.

1257
01:20:08,350 --> 01:20:12,479
So, uh... uh...
It's a bit of a surprise seeing...

1258
01:20:12,604 --> 01:20:14,523
- Yeah.
- How'd you find us?

1259
01:20:14,606 --> 01:20:17,192
Olla. Yeah.

1260
01:20:17,317 --> 01:20:20,320
So, uh, how you been?

1261
01:20:22,239 --> 01:20:23,699
Pretty good.

1262
01:20:23,782 --> 01:20:26,034
You know. It's...

1263
01:20:29,288 --> 01:20:34,209
Well, I'm gonna go back with Casey.
It was nice to meet you.

1264
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:38,172
- Yeah, wasn't it?
- I'll see you back there, honey.

1265
01:20:38,255 --> 01:20:40,215
Well, at least
he came home last night.

1266
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:42,217
That's more than
I can say for the dog.

1267
01:20:42,342 --> 01:20:44,303
Why don't you say
something to him?

1268
01:20:44,386 --> 01:20:45,262
Tell him what you think.

1269
01:20:45,345 --> 01:20:47,264
Oh, he'd just deny it.

1270
01:20:47,389 --> 01:20:49,308
If I start to get specific
about things...

1271
01:20:49,391 --> 01:20:52,186
he starts screaming about
what kind of job he has.

1272
01:20:52,269 --> 01:20:54,605
He's a pathological liar.

1273
01:20:55,856 --> 01:20:58,066
To tell you the truth,
I'm more worried about the dog.

1274
01:20:58,192 --> 01:21:01,278
- Mm-hmm. I know what you mean.
- Hi, Sherri. How are the kids?

1275
01:21:01,361 --> 01:21:04,323
They lost their dog.
Suzy ran away.

1276
01:21:04,406 --> 01:21:06,366
That's a shame.
She'll probably be back.

1277
01:21:06,450 --> 01:21:08,368
I wouldn't worry about it.

1278
01:21:08,452 --> 01:21:11,163
It's a he. Suzy's a boy.

1279
01:21:11,246 --> 01:21:12,789
Yeah, yeah. That's...
That's what I meant.

1280
01:21:12,915 --> 01:21:16,335
What are you doing home?
You're not supposed to be home now.

1281
01:21:16,418 --> 01:21:19,755
Oh, we have... we have
that thing with the, uh...

1282
01:21:19,838 --> 01:21:22,424
You know, the, uh,
the husband and wife?

1283
01:21:22,549 --> 01:21:24,426
- Kanes.
- Who are the Kanes?

1284
01:21:24,551 --> 01:21:26,386
They're these people
that we met at the concert.

1285
01:21:26,470 --> 01:21:29,389
They have tickets next to us.
It's not tonight. It's tomorrow night.

1286
01:21:29,473 --> 01:21:32,434
Remember? He's going fishing.
We're gonna eat his fish.

1287
01:21:32,518 --> 01:21:35,229
Tomorrow? Oh, shit!

1288
01:21:35,312 --> 01:21:36,980
Excuse me, Sherri. Um...

1289
01:21:37,105 --> 01:21:40,067
I told Sherri I'd go home, have dinner
with her and the kids. They're really upset.

1290
01:21:40,192 --> 01:21:42,861
Ralph, you're welcome to come.
But Gene's not gonna be there.

1291
01:21:42,945 --> 01:21:45,239
I don't think you want to come, honey.
You don't want to come, do you?

1292
01:21:45,322 --> 01:21:48,033
You don't want
to come, do you?

1293
01:21:48,116 --> 01:21:50,410
No. No, I-I-I can't.

1294
01:21:50,494 --> 01:21:52,829
I've got, uh, work.

1295
01:21:53,330 --> 01:21:54,957
Some lemons.

1296
01:22:03,549 --> 01:22:06,009
I will for a little bit.
Maybe he'll wake up if I'm not here.

1297
01:22:06,093 --> 01:22:08,512
Yeah. Well, when you get home,
just sit and rest...

1298
01:22:08,595 --> 01:22:11,807
or get something to eat,
or just have a bath.

1299
01:22:11,890 --> 01:22:15,727
And let's try to, uh, just, uh,
forget about it, okay?

1300
01:22:15,811 --> 01:22:18,814
- Everything's gonna be all right.
- Oh, yeah.

1301
01:22:18,939 --> 01:22:22,234
Uh, excuse me. I think... Oh, I'm sorry.
I didn't know you were asleep.

1302
01:22:22,317 --> 01:22:25,946
I think your son is in the room
next to my grandson, you know?

1303
01:22:26,029 --> 01:22:28,490
At least, I assume it's your son.
I'm not from around here.

1304
01:22:28,574 --> 01:22:30,951
I'm just here because
the kid got hit by a car.

1305
01:22:31,034 --> 01:22:34,079
Uh, are you the father of
that newsman on Channel 9?

1306
01:22:34,162 --> 01:22:36,498
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

1307
01:22:36,582 --> 01:22:39,168
- Yeah. Well, I'm Knute. This is my wife, Dora.
- Oh, hi. Paul Finnigan.

1308
01:22:39,251 --> 01:22:41,545
Oh, that's your wife?
You two...

1309
01:22:41,670 --> 01:22:44,590
- I'm sorry to hear about your grandson.
- Yeah, he got a cracked skull...

1310
01:22:44,673 --> 01:22:45,841
- and a concussion.
- Oh, no.

1311
01:22:45,966 --> 01:22:48,677
No, he's gonna be all right.
But they said he's in shock right now.

1312
01:22:48,760 --> 01:22:51,638
- I... I...
- Well, our son, Brian...

1313
01:22:51,722 --> 01:22:53,974
- Well, he's been operated on twice.
- Twice.

1314
01:22:54,057 --> 01:22:56,310
- No kidding.
- Somebody shot him on the freeway.

1315
01:22:56,393 --> 01:22:58,020
- What?
- Yes.

1316
01:22:58,145 --> 01:23:00,898
- Just driving along, minding his own business.
- Driving along, minding his own business.

1317
01:23:00,939 --> 01:23:03,317
- And somebody shot him.
- Oh, my God. What's the world coming to?

1318
01:23:03,358 --> 01:23:05,777
I don't know.
Nobody knows who did it.

1319
01:23:05,861 --> 01:23:08,780
Jesus. Well, ours was like
a hit-and-run too.

1320
01:23:21,460 --> 01:23:23,629
<i>A recent graduate of
Seton Hall University...</i>

1321
01:23:23,712 --> 01:23:26,924
<i>he drank every day
of his college life.</i>

1322
01:23:27,049 --> 01:23:28,926
<i>- Beer and Jack Daniel's.
- Mom?</i>

1323
01:23:29,051 --> 01:23:31,178
<i>- Yeah, I'm in here.
- Not necessarily together.</i>

1324
01:23:31,261 --> 01:23:33,013
<i>- He still loves to get buzzed.
- Hi.</i>

1325
01:23:33,096 --> 01:23:34,932
<i>He doesn't do it
quite as much.</i>

1326
01:23:35,015 --> 01:23:36,642
<i>But he's not about
to give up drinking.</i>

1327
01:23:36,725 --> 01:23:38,519
- Hi.
- Shh. I'm watching.

1328
01:23:38,602 --> 01:23:40,604
<i>- What are you watching?
- Don't call it a disease.</i>

1329
01:23:40,729 --> 01:23:43,982
- Why do you like that guy?
- Phil? I love him.

1330
01:23:44,066 --> 01:23:45,984
- Got you something.
- Huh?

1331
01:23:46,068 --> 01:23:49,821
- Look.
- Oh, cute. Goldfish. Haven't seen those in years.

1332
01:23:49,905 --> 01:23:51,907
Aren't those nice?

1333
01:23:52,032 --> 01:23:54,576
- I'll set it up for ya.
- How you feed 'em?

1334
01:23:54,701 --> 01:23:56,495
I'll show ya.

1335
01:23:56,578 --> 01:23:58,997
Jesus. Ma, it smells
like a bar in here.

1336
01:24:00,165 --> 01:24:04,419
Well, Earl's startin' on another one.
I don't know if I can take it anymore.

1337
01:24:04,503 --> 01:24:06,755
He gets so mean.
Didn't use to.

1338
01:24:06,839 --> 01:24:09,091
We used to have a good time
when we drank.

1339
01:24:09,174 --> 01:24:11,468
How long you gonna
let that guy ruin your life?

1340
01:24:15,180 --> 01:24:18,392
Mom, what are you doing smoking?
You said you quit.

1341
01:24:18,475 --> 01:24:21,061
I can't quit smokin' when I got
a lot of other stuff goin' on.

1342
01:24:21,186 --> 01:24:23,730
Why don't you think
about yourself for a change, huh?

1343
01:24:23,856 --> 01:24:25,524
I got to think about Earl.

1344
01:24:25,607 --> 01:24:27,985
Mom, he is a... he is a pig.
Do you know that?

1345
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,945
He's a drunken, stupid pig.

1346
01:24:30,028 --> 01:24:32,072
I don't want you to talk that way
about your father.

1347
01:24:32,155 --> 01:24:33,991
He's not my father.

1348
01:24:34,116 --> 01:24:35,868
Well, he's my husband.
Don't you forget it.

1349
01:24:35,951 --> 01:24:39,079
He's an asshole.
I know, Mom.

1350
01:24:39,162 --> 01:24:41,665
- Believe me, I know. He's a...
- You don't know.

1351
01:24:41,748 --> 01:24:44,585
I don't want to
hear that anymore.

1352
01:24:44,668 --> 01:24:46,628
You told that story
one time too many.

1353
01:24:46,712 --> 01:24:50,007
Look at me. He was
drunk anyway, and you know it.

1354
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:53,552
He's all I've got.
I need company.

1355
01:24:53,635 --> 01:24:56,054
<i>We're addicted to addiction.</i>

1356
01:24:57,556 --> 01:25:00,726
Honey, yesterday I hit a kid.

1357
01:25:00,809 --> 01:25:03,520
- What?
- I hit an eight-year-old kid.

1358
01:25:03,604 --> 01:25:05,814
He wasn't hurt. I just kind of
brushed him, knocked him down.

1359
01:25:05,939 --> 01:25:09,568
But it was so close.
He's such a little sweetie too.

1360
01:25:09,651 --> 01:25:12,446
I tried to give him a lift to his house.
He told me his mom and dad told him...

1361
01:25:12,529 --> 01:25:15,032
never to get into the car with anybody
unless they said it was okay.

1362
01:25:15,157 --> 01:25:18,744
Oh. You're very lucky,
you know that?

1363
01:25:19,703 --> 01:25:21,997
If I'd been going faster,
I would've killed him.

1364
01:25:22,873 --> 01:25:24,082
Imagine.

1365
01:25:24,166 --> 01:25:27,169
How could you get over that?
You couldn't.

1366
01:25:28,712 --> 01:25:32,216
I came home. I told Earl
our whole life could change.

1367
01:25:32,341 --> 01:25:34,635
Earl tells me
to go on a diet.

1368
01:25:34,718 --> 01:25:36,637
That's all he could
think of to say.

1369
01:25:46,188 --> 01:25:48,065
Hey!

1370
01:25:54,404 --> 01:25:57,241
I tell ya? Did I tell ya?

1371
01:25:57,366 --> 01:25:59,243
That's the best fishing
I've ever had.

1372
01:25:59,368 --> 01:26:01,328
Yeah, but I lost four
of those motherfuckers.

1373
01:26:03,997 --> 01:26:09,294
Yeah, but tell me it wasn't worth it. I mean,
even four hours of walking is worth this.

1374
01:26:11,713 --> 01:26:13,924
Yeah, but what
are we gonna...

1375
01:26:14,049 --> 01:26:16,009
do about you-know-what?

1376
01:26:18,470 --> 01:26:20,806
I'm gonna take
another picture.

1377
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:51,295
Okay. Uh, right there, bring it down a little bit.
Right on the cantabile. A little bit down.

1378
01:26:51,378 --> 01:26:53,839
Zoe, is that bothering you?

1379
01:26:53,922 --> 01:26:56,466
- It looks terrible.
- Oh, no.

1380
01:26:56,592 --> 01:26:58,969
- Can we start right...
- How did you do that?

1381
01:26:59,094 --> 01:27:01,847
Um, I fell carrying
my mom's lunch tray.

1382
01:27:01,930 --> 01:27:04,558
- Can we start right at... at...
- By the way, how is your mother?

1383
01:27:04,683 --> 01:27:08,645
- Is... Is she all right?
- No.

1384
01:27:08,770 --> 01:27:13,984
I don't think she's got much time left.
I can see her change right in front of my eyes.

1385
01:27:14,067 --> 01:27:16,945
It's a cruel disease. Can...
Can we start at number six?

1386
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,947
Okay. Number six.

1387
01:27:38,050 --> 01:27:39,635
Ah.

1388
01:27:47,184 --> 01:27:50,437
<i>- Hello? Howard?
- No, this is not Howard.</i>

1389
01:27:50,521 --> 01:27:52,606
Oh, I'm sorry.
Who are you calling?

1390
01:27:52,731 --> 01:27:54,858
<i>Casey.</i>

1391
01:27:54,983 --> 01:27:57,945
<i>I want to talk about
that little bastard Casey.</i>

1392
01:27:58,070 --> 01:28:00,822
Casey? Who is this?

1393
01:28:02,366 --> 01:28:04,368
Hello?

1394
01:28:05,661 --> 01:28:06,745
Hello?

1395
01:29:42,716 --> 01:29:44,510
This is good. Is that Suzy?

1396
01:29:45,677 --> 01:29:47,721
Is that her tail?
That's nice. I really like that.

1397
01:29:47,846 --> 01:29:49,890
- Marian.
- Okay.

1398
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:56,104
- Don't let the kids see.
- Why?

1399
01:29:56,146 --> 01:29:56,188
END OF CD1

1400
01:29:56,271 --> 01:29:58,607
'Cause I don't want to hear
Gene's bullshit.

1401
01:29:58,691 --> 01:30:00,609
<i>No!</i>

1402
01:30:02,403 --> 01:30:04,947
He's playing around.
I can smell it on him.

1403
01:30:05,030 --> 01:30:07,574
- You think it's serious?
- As serious as it ever is.

1404
01:30:07,658 --> 01:30:09,535
Why do you put up
with it, Sherri?

1405
01:30:09,660 --> 01:30:11,829
I just got to sweat it out.

1406
01:30:11,912 --> 01:30:16,291
She'll dump him, and then he'll come
running home to Mommy all lovey-dovey.

1407
01:30:16,375 --> 01:30:18,585
- It's always the same story.
- He's such an asshole.

1408
01:30:18,669 --> 01:30:20,879
He's such a liar.

1409
01:30:22,548 --> 01:30:25,926
Sometimes I ask him stuff
just to entertain myself.

1410
01:30:26,009 --> 01:30:26,969
What do you mean?

1411
01:30:27,052 --> 01:30:30,889
Just to see what kind of cockamamy lie
he's gonna come up with next.

1412
01:30:30,973 --> 01:30:33,809
I mean, some of the stories
are really fantastic.

1413
01:30:42,026 --> 01:30:44,194
Betty.

1414
01:32:17,955 --> 01:32:19,498
How's the sex?

1415
01:32:23,293 --> 01:32:25,295
Well, he's real quick.

1416
01:32:26,839 --> 01:32:29,174
He's too quick for me.

1417
01:32:29,258 --> 01:32:32,302
Plus, he won't do oral.

1418
01:32:32,386 --> 01:32:35,931
- Do you?
- I used to, before we got married.

1419
01:32:36,014 --> 01:32:39,351
I would if he would stop
fooling around. I kind of like it.

1420
01:32:42,938 --> 01:32:44,481
What about you?

1421
01:32:46,066 --> 01:32:48,444
- Ralph's pretty conservative.
- Yeah?

1422
01:32:49,028 --> 01:32:50,946
<i>No!</i>

1423
01:32:51,238 --> 01:32:54,074
How about other than Ralph?

1424
01:32:54,199 --> 01:32:56,827
Oh, we've been married
a long time, Sherri.

1425
01:32:58,454 --> 01:33:00,914
There's never been anybody else
since you've been married?

1426
01:33:04,626 --> 01:33:06,545
No.

1427
01:33:08,130 --> 01:33:10,049
Yeah. Me neither.

1428
01:33:13,177 --> 01:33:15,054
Not since the kids.

1429
01:33:36,075 --> 01:33:39,328
This atmosphere sure brings it
back to me, son, I'll tell ya.

1430
01:33:39,411 --> 01:33:43,582
How many years has it been?
Say, what? Maybe 25 years?

1431
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:46,251
- What?
- Your accident.

1432
01:33:46,377 --> 01:33:49,380
Oh, it's about, uh, 30.

1433
01:33:49,463 --> 01:33:52,091
I don't know where
all that time went.

1434
01:33:53,384 --> 01:33:54,551
Oh.

1435
01:33:55,636 --> 01:33:58,305
Howard. Uh-oh.

1436
01:33:59,264 --> 01:34:02,393
You remember?
I brought it along to show, uh...

1437
01:34:02,518 --> 01:34:04,603
- Casey.
- Casey. Yeah.

1438
01:34:04,728 --> 01:34:06,605
Casey.

1439
01:34:09,566 --> 01:34:12,069
Speaking of that,
you know the creek?

1440
01:34:12,194 --> 01:34:15,322
You can't cross it anymore now.
They put a gate up about 10, 11 year...

1441
01:34:15,447 --> 01:34:18,617
- Yeah, 11 years ago. Just before I left.
- Yeah? That's good.

1442
01:34:18,742 --> 01:34:22,538
Of course, if they'd had
a gate, that would have...

1443
01:34:22,621 --> 01:34:23,706
changed things, wouldn't it?

1444
01:34:23,789 --> 01:34:25,833
I mean, you wouldn't have been
in the hospital that day.

1445
01:34:25,958 --> 01:34:28,877
And I... Hell, you probably
wouldn't be out here.

1446
01:34:28,961 --> 01:34:32,047
You might not have even had Casey,
let alone him being in the hospital.

1447
01:34:32,131 --> 01:34:34,425
We could still be back in
Minnesota with me, and married...

1448
01:34:34,508 --> 01:34:36,135
Pop, stop it.

1449
01:34:58,782 --> 01:35:00,617
<i>Hi. This is the Finnigan home.</i>

1450
01:35:00,701 --> 01:35:03,537

01:35:25,768 --> 01:35:29,021
<i>"but there is no joy
in Mudville...</i>

1459
01:35:29,146 --> 01:35:32,983
<i>mighty Casey has struck out."</i>

1460
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:37,279
You still resent my not being
in the hospital with you, don't ya?

1461
01:35:37,363 --> 01:35:39,448
No, I don't.
I don't even remember.

1462
01:35:39,531 --> 01:35:41,742
Yeah, you do.

1463
01:35:42,576 --> 01:35:45,746
You know it, uh...
it wasn't my decision.

1464
01:35:45,871 --> 01:35:49,458
Things had gotten so out of hand between
your mother and me by then that I...

1465
01:35:49,541 --> 01:35:52,711
Hell, I didn't want to be in
your room and make it worse.

1466
01:35:52,836 --> 01:35:54,505
I don't even remember
the hospital.

1467
01:35:54,588 --> 01:35:58,008
I remember, uh,
the car flippin' over...

1468
01:35:58,133 --> 01:36:01,470
and gettin' washed away.

1469
01:36:01,553 --> 01:36:03,222
That's about it.

1470
01:36:05,599 --> 01:36:08,685
I did something that day
that I'd never done in my life.

1471
01:36:12,272 --> 01:36:14,566
I didn't tell your mother
the truth.

1472
01:36:15,901 --> 01:36:18,278
Called in sick, and then I left
like I was going to work.

1473
01:36:18,362 --> 01:36:20,531
And I didn't tell your mother
I was going over to Olla's house...

1474
01:36:20,572 --> 01:36:22,866
to hook up a new fridge
and an ice maker.

1475
01:36:22,950 --> 01:36:24,660
She'd have had a fit!

1476
01:36:24,702 --> 01:36:26,870
I mean, even if she knew that
I was getting paid for my time...

1477
01:36:26,954 --> 01:36:28,872
she would have had a fit.

1478
01:36:28,956 --> 01:36:31,041
It was okay for her to help Olla.
Oh, not for me.

1479
01:36:31,125 --> 01:36:33,293
See? She was very
possessive that way.

1480
01:36:33,419 --> 01:36:35,504
Well, sisters are funny,
you know.

1481
01:36:35,587 --> 01:36:39,174
Hell, in this case, I was happy to oblige.
I needed the extra money.

1482
01:36:39,258 --> 01:36:41,176
And it was Olla's idea
not to involve your mother.

1483
01:36:41,260 --> 01:36:44,471
It was Olla's idea
for me to lie.

1484
01:36:45,764 --> 01:36:49,476
I figured it would take a couple hours. Then
I'll go to work, tell 'em I'm feeling better.

1485
01:36:49,601 --> 01:36:52,104
Anyway, I... I told Olla
I'd be over early, and I was.

1486
01:36:52,229 --> 01:36:54,898
But there was no answer.
So, uh, the... the door was open.

1487
01:36:54,982 --> 01:36:58,277
I go in. I hear that she's up
in the shower. So, I holler out...

1488
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:00,904
you know, so that she won't get scared
when she comes out of the shower...

1489
01:37:00,946 --> 01:37:03,615
and hears me working down
in the basement, and so forth.

1490
01:37:03,699 --> 01:37:06,452
Anyway, I go down.
After a while, Olla...

1491
01:37:06,535 --> 01:37:08,537
comes down to the basement...

1492
01:37:09,872 --> 01:37:12,166
In a robe.

1493
01:37:12,249 --> 01:37:13,709
Huh?

1494
01:37:14,209 --> 01:37:18,505
And she says that
she got cleaned up... for me.

1495
01:37:18,589 --> 01:37:22,760
And I think that's very odd
to say under the circumstances.

1496
01:37:22,843 --> 01:37:26,680
But you know Olla. Anyhow,
she says, "How's it going?"

1497
01:37:26,764 --> 01:37:29,641
I said, "Fine".
And, uh, after a while she...

1498
01:37:29,725 --> 01:37:31,977
Yeah, she asked me if I wanted a beer.
She says, "You want a beer?"

1499
01:37:32,061 --> 01:37:35,022
I said, "Geez, it's a little early in the morning
for that sort of thing, isn't it?"

1500
01:37:35,105 --> 01:37:38,400
She says, "Well, I'm not your employer,
am I? Do you want one or not?"

1501
01:37:38,484 --> 01:37:42,821
I said, "Oh, well, what the hell. Why not?"
It seemed like a good idea at the time.

1502
01:37:42,905 --> 01:37:44,239
She comes back
with two beers.

1503
01:37:44,323 --> 01:37:47,826
I tell ya, every time I finish a beer...
foom! There's another one in my hand.

1504
01:37:47,868 --> 01:37:50,913
Christ, now we're up in the kitchen. And
I'm havin' trouble makin' the joints connect...

1505
01:37:50,996 --> 01:37:53,248
I... 'Cause I'm on
my fourth or fifth beer.

1506
01:37:53,332 --> 01:37:55,793
And I said, "Olla..."
In fact, this is exactly what I said.

1507
01:37:55,876 --> 01:37:57,920
Oh, I'll never forget this.

1508
01:37:58,003 --> 01:38:02,383
I said, "Olla, if I have one more beer,
I'm gonna have to take a nap."

1509
01:38:02,466 --> 01:38:04,968
And she says,
"I wondered what it would take...

1510
01:38:05,094 --> 01:38:07,930
to get you into bed."

1511
01:38:08,013 --> 01:38:09,431
Hey.

1512
01:38:10,140 --> 01:38:12,184
Now, I laughed. You know, I...

1513
01:38:12,309 --> 01:38:16,105
She says, "Don't tell me it didn't
cross your mind, because I'll call you a liar."

1514
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:18,232
Well, I'll tell you the truth.
It didn't... ever!

1515
01:38:18,315 --> 01:38:20,109
Yeah, I found
her company attractive.

1516
01:38:20,192 --> 01:38:22,444
But, Jesus,
there was no real...

1517
01:38:22,528 --> 01:38:25,614
And I didn't...

1518
01:38:26,532 --> 01:38:30,285
I don't know. I didn't want
to hurt her feelings, you know?

1519
01:38:30,369 --> 01:38:32,871
I mean, after all,
it was your mother's sister.

1520
01:38:34,081 --> 01:38:36,750
Anyway, I, uh... I don't know
how much time passed.

1521
01:38:36,834 --> 01:38:41,213
All I know is that I am working like hell on that
ice maker trying to get the damn thing going.

1522
01:38:41,255 --> 01:38:43,924
And she is saying
things like, uh...

1523
01:38:44,007 --> 01:38:47,594
"If the positions were reversed,
my sister would be doing the same thing."

1524
01:38:47,678 --> 01:38:51,056
Do you believe... You know, like this is
some little thing between the two of...

1525
01:38:51,140 --> 01:38:54,935
I started sweating. I tell you, my knees
are shaking. I don't know what the hell to do.

1526
01:38:55,060 --> 01:38:57,980
- I don't know which way to turn.
- There's no smokin'in here, Pop.

1527
01:38:58,063 --> 01:38:59,189
- Huh?
- No smoking.

1528
01:38:59,231 --> 01:39:01,859
That's good.
Down to four a day.

1529
01:39:02,526 --> 01:39:05,279
And then...

1530
01:39:05,404 --> 01:39:07,322
She opens the robe.

1531
01:39:07,406 --> 01:39:11,326
And I get a load... Oh, Jesus.
God, that woman was put together...

1532
01:39:11,410 --> 01:39:14,163
a hell of lot better than you'd think
when she was just in a dress.

1533
01:39:14,246 --> 01:39:17,291
I'm tellin' ya. Jesus,
that's hard for any man to resist.

1534
01:39:17,374 --> 01:39:20,836
I mean... I don't know about you...
it sure as hell was for me.

1535
01:39:20,919 --> 01:39:22,838
Yeah, well, that, uh...

1536
01:39:22,921 --> 01:39:25,049
that's a long time ago, Pop.

1537
01:39:25,591 --> 01:39:27,092
So...

1538
01:39:34,892 --> 01:39:37,061
Neither of us heard
your mother come in.

1539
01:39:37,144 --> 01:39:39,480
Oh, God Almighty.

1540
01:39:40,773 --> 01:39:43,233
She was in such a state.
You know, she...

1541
01:39:43,317 --> 01:39:46,070
Sh-She... She didn't really
look at Olla. She just...

1542
01:39:46,153 --> 01:39:48,739
She looked at me, and she said,
"Howard's in the hospital."

1543
01:39:48,822 --> 01:39:52,534
And then on... on the way
to the hospital, she said...

1544
01:39:52,618 --> 01:39:56,747
Well, she cried a little bit.
But... But she... she only said...

1545
01:39:56,830 --> 01:40:00,209
"Why didn't you tell me that
you weren't going to work?

1546
01:40:00,292 --> 01:40:01,585
They told me you were sick."

1547
01:40:01,668 --> 01:40:04,713
Oh, Christ, I was
so ashamed. I just...

1548
01:40:06,131 --> 01:40:08,050
It was... It was an
unlucky day, you know?

1549
01:40:08,133 --> 01:40:10,386
Bad... timing.

1550
01:40:10,469 --> 01:40:12,221
But I tell you, that
first day in the hospital...

1551
01:40:12,304 --> 01:40:16,308
your mother and I stood side by side
while those doctors reported to us.

1552
01:40:16,392 --> 01:40:19,812
And most of the news was bad.
But still, we stood there together.

1553
01:40:19,895 --> 01:40:22,064
We took it together!

1554
01:40:22,898 --> 01:40:25,234
And then Olla lied.

1555
01:40:26,902 --> 01:40:30,406
God! Olla told your mother
that... that...

1556
01:40:30,489 --> 01:40:32,408
we'd been having
affairs in the past.

1557
01:40:32,491 --> 01:40:36,328
It was only that one time. I tr...
Oh, I tried to explain to your mother...

1558
01:40:36,412 --> 01:40:38,497
exactly how it happened.

1559
01:40:40,916 --> 01:40:42,835
You know what
your mother said...

1560
01:40:44,169 --> 01:40:46,004
to me?

1561
01:40:46,964 --> 01:40:49,341
"I don't want you
around anymore.

1562
01:40:51,635 --> 01:40:55,597
"I'll get through
this thing alone... better.

1563
01:40:56,473 --> 01:40:59,101
No matter what
happens to Howard."

1564
01:41:00,102 --> 01:41:01,854
I had to respect
her wishes, Howard.

1565
01:41:01,937 --> 01:41:04,732
I mean, whether I
wanted to or not. I had to.

1566
01:41:06,442 --> 01:41:09,987
Christ, I kept thinking, you know,
someday... some... some... some...

1567
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:13,198
The truth will come out, you know,
and she'll understand.

1568
01:41:17,327 --> 01:41:20,497
We both know that
never happened, so...

1569
01:41:22,458 --> 01:41:24,626
Mr. Finnigan?
Excuse me, Mr. Finnigan.

1570
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:25,878
You have a telephone call.

1571
01:41:25,961 --> 01:41:29,214
It's Mrs. Finnigan. Oh, you can
use that phone right there.

1572
01:41:32,634 --> 01:41:35,596
Yeah, hi. Everything's
okay here. You all right?

1573
01:41:35,679 --> 01:41:38,390
Um, I'm coming back to the hospital.
Do you want me to bring you anything?

1574
01:41:38,474 --> 01:41:41,435
<i>Why? You should get
a good night's sleep.</i>

1575
01:41:41,477 --> 01:41:44,021
<i>- Casey's gonna be all right.
- I'm not staying here.</i>

1576
01:41:44,146 --> 01:41:46,607
That crazy person keeps calling.
I'm scared to death.

1577
01:41:46,690 --> 01:41:49,068
Well, don't, uh...
don't answer the phone, honey.

1578
01:41:49,151 --> 01:41:51,987
Maybe it's the...
the driver from the car.

1579
01:41:52,071 --> 01:41:55,282
Maybe she's, uh, feeling
guilty or something.

1580
01:41:55,366 --> 01:41:57,368
It's a man.

1581
01:41:58,202 --> 01:41:59,703
<i>Well, don't worry.</i>

1582
01:41:59,787 --> 01:42:01,705
<i>I mean, I'm here with Casey.</i>

1583
01:42:01,789 --> 01:42:04,666
<i>The doctors and the nurses
are there with him all the time.</i>

1584
01:42:04,750 --> 01:42:08,087
<i>- He's gonna be all right.
- No, I'm comin'.</i>

1585
01:42:08,170 --> 01:42:12,007
No... I wish you wouldn't.
Honey?

1586
01:42:16,428 --> 01:42:19,848
Uh, you finish your coffee.
I gotta get back.

1587
01:42:43,288 --> 01:42:45,040
<i>Hi. This is the Finnigan home.</i>

1588
01:42:45,124 --> 01:42:47,960
<i>We can't get to
the phone right now,</i>

1589
01:42:48,043 --> 01:42:50,796
<i>so leave a message
after the beep.</i>

1590
01:43:04,393 --> 01:43:08,355
- That is a good painting.
- Yeah.

1591
01:43:08,439 --> 01:43:10,399
Really good.

1592
01:43:12,192 --> 01:43:13,360
- Colors are good.
- Yeah.

1593
01:43:13,444 --> 01:43:15,738
- Goes with the walls.
- But look at these fish, though.

1594
01:43:15,821 --> 01:43:17,990
- Aren't those cool?
- Mmm.

1595
01:43:18,115 --> 01:43:21,118
- Aren't those cool?
- Yeah, I don't really give a fuck about fish.

1596
01:43:21,243 --> 01:43:23,454
They just kinda swim and shit.

1597
01:43:24,663 --> 01:43:27,041
- Hey, your makeup looks good.
- Yeah?

1598
01:43:27,166 --> 01:43:30,502
- You think it's too much, though?
- No. You're like a model.

1599
01:43:30,627 --> 01:43:32,379
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

1600
01:43:32,463 --> 01:43:33,380
- Hey.
- Almost ready.

1601
01:43:33,464 --> 01:43:35,674
- Did Bill do it?
- Yeah. Of course he did.

1602
01:43:35,758 --> 01:43:39,011
- Bill, you've gotta do me sometime.
- Yeah, sure.

1603
01:43:39,094 --> 01:43:41,013
Hey, make mine well-done.

1604
01:43:42,431 --> 01:43:43,682
Hey.

1605
01:43:44,308 --> 01:43:45,976
Look at that.

1606
01:43:47,644 --> 01:43:49,313
- Look at that.
- Looks pretty.

1607
01:43:49,396 --> 01:43:51,774
So, what were you saying
about, um, the virt...

1608
01:43:51,857 --> 01:43:53,776
- What is it? The virtual...
- Virtual reality.

1609
01:43:53,859 --> 01:43:55,402
- Yeah.
- Okay.

1610
01:43:55,486 --> 01:43:56,862
You know what "virtual" means?

1611
01:43:56,945 --> 01:43:58,405
Uh, sort of.

1612
01:43:58,947 --> 01:44:01,700
Okay, it's like really real.

1613
01:44:01,825 --> 01:44:03,827
So, virtual reality...

1614
01:44:03,952 --> 01:44:07,915
is practically, totally real...

1615
01:44:07,998 --> 01:44:09,958
- but not.
- Mm-hmm.

1616
01:44:10,459 --> 01:44:12,252
<i>- Claire?
- Stand by.</i>

1617
01:44:13,003 --> 01:44:14,046
<i>At my command...</i>

1618
01:44:14,171 --> 01:44:17,216
<i>- Claire?
- Get back here!</i>

1619
01:44:25,849 --> 01:44:27,726
<i>Goddamn it!</i>

1620
01:44:29,144 --> 01:44:30,229
<i>Listen!</i>

1621
01:44:36,652 --> 01:44:38,153
Stuart.

1622
01:44:39,905 --> 01:44:41,865
I thought you weren't
coming home till tomorrow.

1623
01:44:41,949 --> 01:44:44,702
- Well, you know.
- Oh.

1624
01:44:44,785 --> 01:44:47,788
God, I hate that fish smell.

1625
01:44:48,872 --> 01:44:52,376
They said on the TV that
there was rain up there.

1626
01:44:52,459 --> 01:44:55,546
- Did you get rained out?
- No. Caught our limit.

1627
01:44:55,671 --> 01:44:57,589
- Oh.
- Mmm. Mmm, mmm, mmm.

1628
01:44:57,715 --> 01:44:59,591
And I missed you.

1629
01:44:59,717 --> 01:45:02,594
That'll be the day.

1630
01:45:02,720 --> 01:45:05,222
- Your hands stink.
- Mmm.

1631
01:45:06,265 --> 01:45:08,600
- Phew.
- Kind of smells like pussy, don't you think?

1632
01:45:08,726 --> 01:45:12,730
I hate that.
Go wash your hands.

1633
01:45:13,731 --> 01:45:16,608
- Stop it!
- Smells like a rainbow to me.

1634
01:45:16,734 --> 01:45:19,069
- Go wash your hands.
- Come on. Come on, come on.

1635
01:45:19,153 --> 01:45:21,238
What are you doing?

1636
01:45:22,573 --> 01:45:25,367
Come on. I've been sleeping
with men for three days.

1637
01:45:53,729 --> 01:45:55,898
Bunny, my ass.

1638
01:46:17,044 --> 01:46:19,922
- I'm glad you came home early.
- Oh, me too.

1639
01:46:26,428 --> 01:46:28,347
- Oh.
- Ooh, you're all wet.

1640
01:46:28,430 --> 01:46:30,724
Yeah. You'll have
to dry me off.

1641
01:46:37,981 --> 01:46:41,527
Did I ever tell you about what happened
in the last Pomona game in '83?

1642
01:46:42,319 --> 01:46:46,156
- You remember that game?
- Yeah, I broke my... broke my ankle.

1643
01:46:46,240 --> 01:46:50,869
Right. Okay, well, while
you were snapping your ankle...

1644
01:46:50,994 --> 01:46:53,664
me and Red...

1645
01:46:53,789 --> 01:46:57,084
we slipped Mickeys
on these four girls.

1646
01:46:57,167 --> 01:46:59,461
This is true. These, like,
bootleg quaaludes.

1647
01:46:59,545 --> 01:47:01,964
Like... Like
dangerous stuff, right?

1648
01:47:02,047 --> 01:47:05,426
And I remember 'cause two of
the girls' names was Kelly. Remember?

1649
01:47:05,551 --> 01:47:08,262
I think you might have met
those two Kellys before.

1650
01:47:10,806 --> 01:47:12,975
He doesn't call you, does he?

1651
01:47:13,058 --> 01:47:16,520
- What do you mean?
- You know, when you're workin'.

1652
01:47:16,603 --> 01:47:20,149
Oh. I don't think so.

1653
01:47:20,232 --> 01:47:23,027
I mean, I get a lot of Bills...

1654
01:47:23,110 --> 01:47:25,571
but it's... it's a
common name.

1655
01:47:25,654 --> 01:47:28,449
'Cause you'd recognize
his voice, right?

1656
01:47:28,532 --> 01:47:30,159
Oh, yeah.

1657
01:47:30,242 --> 01:47:32,995
Oh, it was so weird.

1658
01:47:33,078 --> 01:47:36,081
The bishop in my
parents' church called me.

1659
01:47:36,206 --> 01:47:39,376
Oh, and he wanted,
um, an incest call...

1660
01:47:39,460 --> 01:47:41,879
with, like, a four-year-old girl.

1661
01:47:41,962 --> 01:47:45,632
I mean, I look at, you know,
Joe-Joe or Josette.

1662
01:47:45,716 --> 01:47:48,385
Man, that is fucked up.

1663
01:47:48,469 --> 01:47:49,887
Oh, man.

1664
01:47:49,970 --> 01:47:52,681
Oh, that could just
fuck your life up.

1665
01:47:52,765 --> 01:47:54,683
I mean, a little
eight-year-old girl...

1666
01:47:54,767 --> 01:47:57,853
she just does whatever
the adult tells her to do.

1667
01:47:57,936 --> 01:48:00,064
Oh, man. I... I know.

1668
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:02,232
Believe me, that's fucked.

1669
01:48:02,358 --> 01:48:04,693
Okay, look, I...
I don't condone it...

1670
01:48:04,777 --> 01:48:07,404
but it's a money call.

1671
01:48:07,529 --> 01:48:11,283
And... keeps him off
the streets, anyway.

1672
01:48:11,408 --> 01:48:12,785
I like this music.

1673
01:48:12,868 --> 01:48:16,038
Yeah. This is good, huh? It's like
it's not... I don't know. It's different.

1674
01:48:16,121 --> 01:48:19,833
It's kind of dry.
It's like a dry humping...

1675
01:48:19,958 --> 01:48:23,962
some wet... pussy... flap.

1676
01:48:26,048 --> 01:48:28,258
Wet pussy.

1677
01:48:28,384 --> 01:48:30,302
I know what that's
all about.

1678
01:48:43,232 --> 01:48:45,609
You make me very happy.

1679
01:48:49,405 --> 01:48:52,658
- Claire.
- Hmm?

1680
01:48:52,783 --> 01:48:55,661
We found a body up there.

1681
01:48:55,744 --> 01:48:58,330
A girl.

1682
01:48:58,455 --> 01:49:00,499
Guess she was murdered.

1683
01:49:04,503 --> 01:49:06,505
Stuart.

1684
01:49:07,756 --> 01:49:09,258
Well, when we
got there, she was...

1685
01:49:09,341 --> 01:49:13,387
This, uh, naked body
in the water...

1686
01:49:13,470 --> 01:49:15,264
just floatin' there.

1687
01:49:16,014 --> 01:49:17,766
Dead.

1688
01:49:20,102 --> 01:49:22,020
Jesus.

1689
01:49:24,148 --> 01:49:26,650
When? Were you fishing?

1690
01:49:26,775 --> 01:49:29,028
Nah. No, we...
we just got up there.

1691
01:49:29,111 --> 01:49:31,363
We're setting up camp, and...

1692
01:49:31,488 --> 01:49:35,075
Well, Vern saw it
in the water.

1693
01:49:36,535 --> 01:49:38,120
It was really somethin'.

1694
01:49:38,912 --> 01:49:41,165
I never experienced
anything like it before.

1695
01:49:42,291 --> 01:49:44,209
Hell, no one knew
what to do.

1696
01:49:46,086 --> 01:49:48,213
What did you do?

1697
01:49:48,881 --> 01:49:52,009
Well, you know, there wasn't
much we could do.

1698
01:49:52,134 --> 01:49:54,303
It was... It was gettin' dark...

1699
01:49:54,386 --> 01:49:58,223
and, uh, she was dead.

1700
01:49:59,183 --> 01:50:01,351
Nothin' was gonna
change that.

1701
01:50:02,686 --> 01:50:05,356
- How old was she?
- Huh?

1702
01:50:05,439 --> 01:50:07,900
How old was she?

1703
01:50:08,025 --> 01:50:10,444
Uh...
Oh, I don't know.

1704
01:50:10,569 --> 01:50:13,530
In her 20s, maybe.
You couldn't tell.

1705
01:50:17,659 --> 01:50:19,578
Must have been horrible.

1706
01:50:21,830 --> 01:50:23,749
What did you do?

1707
01:50:23,832 --> 01:50:25,334
Nothin'.

1708
01:50:27,002 --> 01:50:28,921
Nothing?

1709
01:50:30,255 --> 01:50:33,842
I mean, after you
got her out of the water.

1710
01:50:33,926 --> 01:50:36,637
- Did she drown?
- We don't know.

1711
01:50:37,679 --> 01:50:40,099
I didn't think we should
move her, you know?

1712
01:50:40,182 --> 01:50:41,934
You left her in the water?

1713
01:50:42,059 --> 01:50:43,936
Yeah.

1714
01:50:53,570 --> 01:50:55,698
For how long?

1715
01:50:55,781 --> 01:50:57,991
Until we left
and reported it.

1716
01:50:58,075 --> 01:50:59,993
I tied her to the bank.

1717
01:51:21,140 --> 01:51:24,518
How long did you say
you left her in the water?

1718
01:51:24,601 --> 01:51:26,603
Claire...

1719
01:51:26,687 --> 01:51:28,772
she was dead.

1720
01:51:28,856 --> 01:51:31,650
We didn't think we should
move her. It was dark.

1721
01:51:31,775 --> 01:51:35,404
We made a decision to leave her there
until we could report it!

1722
01:51:35,487 --> 01:51:37,614
She was already dead!

1723
01:51:38,449 --> 01:51:40,576
And when did you report it?

1724
01:51:40,659 --> 01:51:42,953
This morning. Today.

1725
01:51:43,037 --> 01:51:45,205
- Today?
- Yeah.

1726
01:51:48,292 --> 01:51:50,836
And when did you find her?

1727
01:51:50,961 --> 01:51:53,255
I told you.

1728
01:51:53,338 --> 01:51:55,716
Well, when did you
catch the fish?

1729
01:51:55,799 --> 01:51:57,384
Christ!

1730
01:51:59,011 --> 01:52:00,429
That's what we
went up there for.

1731
01:52:00,512 --> 01:52:02,097
To fish.

1732
01:52:02,181 --> 01:52:04,850
You fished while she
was in the water?

1733
01:52:04,933 --> 01:52:07,770
- You just left her there?
- Claire...

1734
01:52:08,979 --> 01:52:10,856
You're making me sick!

1735
01:52:11,357 --> 01:52:14,568
Marian's got a crush
on Alex Trebek.

1736
01:52:14,693 --> 01:52:17,404
- Alex Trebek?
- Yeah.

1737
01:52:17,529 --> 01:52:20,157
- Where'd she meet him?
- At a party.

1738
01:52:21,408 --> 01:52:25,037
He's an art collector or something.
She thinks he might buy one of her paintings.

1739
01:52:29,625 --> 01:52:31,794
- Nah, I don't think so.
- No?

1740
01:52:31,877 --> 01:52:34,671
<i>I don't see how she could even
give those things away.</i>

1741
01:52:34,755 --> 01:52:37,466
Well, she sells a lot more
than you think.

1742
01:52:42,012 --> 01:52:44,556
I posed for her today.

1743
01:52:44,681 --> 01:52:47,351
- Ralph walked in the middle of it.
- Ralph. What a jerk.

1744
01:52:47,434 --> 01:52:49,686
I don't know if I
know a bigger jerk.

1745
01:52:49,812 --> 01:52:51,855
It was embarrassing, but
I guess they're used to it...

1746
01:52:51,939 --> 01:52:53,857
being doctors and
artists and all.

1747
01:52:53,941 --> 01:52:56,276
What was embarrassing
about it?

1748
01:52:56,402 --> 01:52:58,987
Well, you know.

1749
01:52:59,071 --> 01:53:00,989
I was nude.

1750
01:53:08,247 --> 01:53:10,374
You mean, like,
you were naked?

1751
01:53:10,499 --> 01:53:13,711
Mm-hmm.
"Nude", they call it.

1752
01:53:14,920 --> 01:53:17,464
You mean...

1753
01:53:17,589 --> 01:53:19,550
- without any underpants on...
- Mm-hmm.

1754
01:53:19,633 --> 01:53:21,552
Naked?

1755
01:53:33,772 --> 01:53:38,027
Wouldn't it be a trip if Alex Trebek
bought a nude painting of me?

1756
01:53:58,922 --> 01:54:01,508
<i>Can't stand the suspense</i>

1757
01:54:02,801 --> 01:54:05,846
<i>The endless embraces</i>

1758
01:54:07,056 --> 01:54:08,682
<i>Each episode</i>

1759
01:54:08,766 --> 01:54:11,060
Yeah. Sit over there
under Art Blakey.

1760
01:54:11,143 --> 01:54:12,644
- Why's he here? There's a...
- Who?

1761
01:54:12,770 --> 01:54:15,105
- Art... Where's Art Blakey?
- Where?

1762
01:54:15,189 --> 01:54:18,650
- He's at the bar. Can you block me?
- Oh, yeah. He's listening to the music.

1763
01:54:18,734 --> 01:54:20,736
- He don't see you.
- Can you block me?

1764
01:54:20,819 --> 01:54:22,988
You're blocked, babe.

1765
01:54:23,072 --> 01:54:25,199
- Okay. Okay?
- Earl's here.

1766
01:54:25,282 --> 01:54:26,784
- What?
- Earl's here.

1767
01:54:26,825 --> 01:54:27,701
Where?

1768
01:54:27,785 --> 01:54:29,912
Hey, that's that lady.
I... I just cleaned her pool.

1769
01:54:29,995 --> 01:54:31,997
<i>Kiss</i>

1770
01:54:35,626 --> 01:54:38,587
- It's all black people.
- Is he lookin' over here?

1771
01:54:38,670 --> 01:54:39,671
- No.
- No?

1772
01:54:39,713 --> 01:54:43,258
- I can't believe he's here.
- Wanna go to the Troubadour after this?

1773
01:54:43,342 --> 01:54:46,845
- Did he see me?
- Now he's looking. Now he's not.

1774
01:54:49,056 --> 01:54:52,101
<i>I favor</i>

1775
01:54:52,184 --> 01:54:54,478
<i>A good</i>

<i>Punishing kiss</i>

1777
01:55:01,610 --> 01:55:02,945
Thank you.

1778
01:55:03,028 --> 01:55:04,822
- Whoo!
- Want to puff one? Want to puff?

1779
01:55:04,905 --> 01:55:07,116
- We'll be right back.
- Don't worry. I'll take care of it.

1780
01:55:07,157 --> 01:55:10,911
<i>- Please. He'll see me.
- How you doing?</i>

1781
01:55:11,036 --> 01:55:13,664
<i>Good. I'd like to
sing you some songs...</i>

1782
01:55:13,747 --> 01:55:17,376
<i>that I used to do
with my ex, Chick Trainer.</i>

1783
01:55:17,459 --> 01:55:20,087
That was before
he got me pregnant...

1784
01:55:20,713 --> 01:55:22,589
in Miami...

1785
01:55:22,715 --> 01:55:25,300
and before he
blew his brains out...

1786
01:55:25,384 --> 01:55:27,302
through the hole in his arm.

1787
01:55:27,845 --> 01:55:30,305
<i>- Come here.
- And that was, like, 20 years ago. </i>

1788
01:55:30,389 --> 01:55:33,517
- I don't want to talk to you, Earl.
I'm with some people. Okay?
- I'm with...

1789
01:55:33,642 --> 01:55:35,894
I'm with some people, Earl!
You're embarrassing me!

1790
01:55:35,978 --> 01:55:37,980
You're embarrassing me.

1791
01:55:38,063 --> 01:55:39,773
- Come on, have a drink.
- Earl!

1792
01:55:39,898 --> 01:55:41,567
<i>- Here's a song that says something...
- Go!</i>

1793
01:55:41,650 --> 01:55:44,445
<i>that I think we've all said
at one time or another...</i>

1794
01:55:44,570 --> 01:55:46,864
<i>- To hell with love.
- You okay?</i>

1795
01:55:46,947 --> 01:55:48,574
Mm-hmm.

1796
01:55:56,999 --> 01:55:59,418
- Hey, even if the music sucks here...
- Mm-hmm.

1797
01:55:59,501 --> 01:56:01,045
we're still gonna have fun.

1798
01:56:01,128 --> 01:56:02,588
- All right?
- Yup.

1799
01:56:05,340 --> 01:56:08,260
<i>I'm gonna like somebody</i>

1800
01:56:09,803 --> 01:56:12,306
<i>And let them like me</i>

1801
01:56:13,891 --> 01:56:15,934
<i>- Going further means chains
- You got a light?</i>

1802
01:56:16,060 --> 01:56:18,228
Uh, no.

1803
01:56:18,312 --> 01:56:20,981
<i>And I was born to be free</i>

1804
01:56:21,148 --> 01:56:22,775
<i>To hell with love</i>

1805
01:56:23,901 --> 01:56:27,946
<i>- I like this one. The sentiment anyway.
- To hell with love</i>

1806
01:56:28,072 --> 01:56:30,657
- Shit. You want some?
- Yep.

1807
01:56:30,783 --> 01:56:32,868
<i>I find a way to keep</i>

1808
01:56:32,951 --> 01:56:34,953
<i>From gettin' in too deep</i>

1809
01:56:36,205 --> 01:56:38,123
<i>To hell with love</i>

1810
01:56:38,248 --> 01:56:41,251
- Yeah. It looks good.
- I like this one.

1811
01:56:41,335 --> 01:56:43,462
You looking for a friend, Trixie?

1812
01:56:43,587 --> 01:56:46,090
Uh, I don't need a friend.
I got a husband.

1813
01:56:47,633 --> 01:56:51,136
- You mean them boys that just left?
- Yeah. And they're coming right back.

1814
01:56:51,220 --> 01:56:53,055
I hope they don't
catch you talking to us.

1815
01:56:53,138 --> 01:56:56,475
- Yeah, they'll probably cut your dick off.
- Oh-ho-ho.

1816
01:56:56,600 --> 01:56:59,395
I think they went
to get a blow job.

1817
01:56:59,478 --> 01:57:01,438
That's what I think.

1818
01:57:01,522 --> 01:57:04,316
And I thought you had
to have a brain to think.

1819
01:57:06,151 --> 01:57:08,487
I'll tell you what, Trixie.

1820
01:57:08,612 --> 01:57:11,657
<i>Why don't you
come with me...</i>

1821
01:57:11,782 --> 01:57:14,159
out back...

1822
01:57:14,243 --> 01:57:16,787
and suck on my joint, hmm?

1823
01:57:18,580 --> 01:57:19,748
Hmm?

1824
01:57:19,832 --> 01:57:22,793
Then I'll give you
these two yards.

1825
01:57:22,876 --> 01:57:24,795
Go ahead.
You wanna touch 'em?

1826
01:57:26,338 --> 01:57:30,134
- Would you just leave us alone, please?
- Honey, it's okay.

1827
01:57:30,217 --> 01:57:32,678
It shouldn't take too long.
I just got out of three years of lockup.

1828
01:57:32,803 --> 01:57:35,848
- What's your name?
- My name is Joe, baby.

1829
01:57:37,766 --> 01:57:41,019
- Fuck off, Joe.
- Oh, Trixie.

1830
01:57:41,145 --> 01:57:45,524
Come on, now. You can buy
a lot of mouthwash with that.

1831
01:57:50,279 --> 01:57:51,405
Think about it.

1832
01:58:00,873 --> 01:58:04,168
- What's this?
- Hey, I believe that belongs to me.

1833
01:58:04,251 --> 01:58:06,462
Thank you very much.

1834
01:58:06,545 --> 01:58:08,505
Will you shut up?
The lady's trying to sing.

1835
01:58:09,381 --> 01:58:11,884
<i>I thought that I would die</i>

1836
01:58:11,967 --> 01:58:13,552
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1837
01:58:13,677 --> 01:58:16,805
<i>I could have built
a water bed</i>

1838
01:58:16,889 --> 01:58:20,934
<i>- You want to say somethin'?
- With all the tears I cried</i>

1839
01:58:21,060 --> 01:58:23,896
<i>To hell with love</i>

1840
01:58:24,021 --> 01:58:29,151
<i>- I didn't think so.
- To hell with love</i>

1841
01:58:29,234 --> 01:58:32,488
- Forget him. Forget it.
- Hey.

1842
01:58:32,571 --> 01:58:35,074
<i>When it comes to me and you</i>

1843
01:58:35,824 --> 01:58:38,035
<i>To hell with love</i>

1844
01:58:38,118 --> 01:58:40,204
We could have used
that money, Jerry.

1845
01:58:40,287 --> 01:58:42,373
<i>- I feel a little sick.
- To hell</i>

1846
01:58:42,456 --> 01:58:44,500
<i>- Don't worry about it.
- With love</i>

1847
01:58:44,583 --> 01:58:46,919
Gotta pick your moments.

1848
01:58:47,044 --> 01:58:51,340
<i>When it comes to you and me
that's the way it's gonna be</i>

1849
01:58:51,423 --> 01:58:53,509
<i>If you share my point of view</i>

1850
01:58:53,592 --> 01:58:55,844
<i>I'm the woman made for you</i>

1851
01:58:55,928 --> 01:58:57,846
<i>When it comes to push or shove</i>

1852
01:58:57,930 --> 01:59:00,891
<i> If you're holding out for love</i>

1853
01:59:00,974 --> 01:59:04,228
<i>To hell with love</i>

1854
01:59:11,485 --> 01:59:13,404
Doreen?

1855
01:59:16,073 --> 01:59:17,950
Doreen, it's Earl.

1856
01:59:27,626 --> 01:59:31,296
Doreen! Goddamn it.

1857
01:59:38,512 --> 01:59:40,431
Doreen, baby.

1858
01:59:54,111 --> 01:59:55,988
Doreen?

1859
01:59:57,114 --> 02:00:00,617
Pat. Pat!

1860
02:00:06,457 --> 02:00:08,333
Wilby!

1861
02:00:10,794 --> 02:00:12,671
Wilby!

1862
02:00:26,977 --> 02:00:28,854
Goddamn it!

1863
02:01:20,739 --> 02:01:22,658
What are you doing
up so early?

1864
02:01:26,578 --> 02:01:28,956
Did I leave a roach here?

1865
02:01:29,081 --> 02:01:30,958
Did you see a roach here?

1866
02:01:32,835 --> 02:01:35,170
Damn.

1867
02:01:46,932 --> 02:01:49,435
Had a lousy night.

1868
02:01:49,560 --> 02:01:52,146
Couldn't sing for shit.

1869
02:01:52,271 --> 02:01:54,148
It was a lousy crowd.

1870
02:01:55,399 --> 02:01:57,568
I hate L.A.

1871
02:01:57,651 --> 02:02:00,904
All they do is
snort coke and talk.

1872
02:02:03,741 --> 02:02:07,119
<i>La-la-da-da-da</i>

1873
02:02:08,245 --> 02:02:11,123
<i>La-la
Yeah, I recognize that. I like that.</i>

1874
02:02:14,460 --> 02:02:16,378
I wish Chick was here.

1875
02:02:17,629 --> 02:02:19,715
Maybe I'll get
a job in Amsterdam.

1876
02:02:20,841 --> 02:02:23,802
Chick loved it there.
Everyone does.

1877
02:02:23,927 --> 02:02:26,805
They really know how to treat
a jazz person there.

1878
02:02:29,141 --> 02:02:33,145
How was your night?
How'd your hand do?

1879
02:02:33,270 --> 02:02:37,816
I remember, Chick damn near
cut his finger off once.

1880
02:02:39,318 --> 02:02:41,528
It was in Kansas City.

1881
02:02:41,653 --> 02:02:45,866
And he was working with
Anita O'Day, and, uh... I forget.

1882
02:02:45,991 --> 02:02:48,827
And he punched
the window of a car out...

1883
02:02:48,911 --> 02:02:50,996
'cause he'd left
the keys inside.

1884
02:02:52,956 --> 02:02:55,084
That was really a hard time
for him to play...

1885
02:02:55,167 --> 02:02:59,296
because... the cut
was on his slide hand.

1886
02:02:59,421 --> 02:03:02,633
It kept openin' up.
And I knew it hurt him.

1887
02:03:04,718 --> 02:03:08,055
And when I saw that guy
walk in that club...

1888
02:03:08,180 --> 02:03:11,141
I knew it wasn't
gonna hurt much longer.

1889
02:03:12,434 --> 02:03:14,603
He walked straight to Chick.

1890
02:03:15,854 --> 02:03:19,066
Chick bent down...

1891
02:03:19,191 --> 02:03:22,194
looked up at me and smiled.

1892
02:03:22,319 --> 02:03:26,782
He said, "Five minutes.
Five minutes."

1893
02:03:28,367 --> 02:03:30,285
Well, I'd heard that before.

1894
02:03:31,745 --> 02:03:33,997
Five hours later
I got a phone call.

1895
02:03:35,457 --> 02:03:39,461
Could I please come
and get my old man 'cause...

1896
02:03:39,545 --> 02:03:43,132
he'd O.D.'d, and they didn't
want him in the house.

1897
02:03:44,967 --> 02:03:47,678
So...

1898
02:03:47,761 --> 02:03:50,222
I got there as fast
as I could.

1899
02:03:51,890 --> 02:03:55,853
And...
He was turnin' blue.

1900
02:03:58,105 --> 02:04:01,066
<i>Blue</i>

1901
02:04:01,150 --> 02:04:04,445
<i>And wrapped up in sorrow</i>

1902
02:04:05,779 --> 02:04:08,032
<i>Blue</i>

1903
02:04:08,115 --> 02:04:11,326
<i>Like there's</i>

1904
02:04:11,410 --> 02:04:13,328
<i>No</i>

1905
02:04:47,279 --> 02:04:49,156
Well, you're up early.

1906
02:04:50,366 --> 02:04:52,284
I have things to do.

1907
02:05:10,677 --> 02:05:12,596
Work?

1908
02:05:12,679 --> 02:05:14,598
Yes.

1909
02:05:20,979 --> 02:05:24,108
Uh, aren't we supposed
to have dinner with, uh...

1910
02:05:24,191 --> 02:05:26,652
with, uh, those
concert people tonight?

1911
02:05:27,277 --> 02:05:30,114
- The Wymans.
- Yeah, them.

1912
02:05:32,408 --> 02:05:34,535
- Yes, we are.
- Claire, about last night...

1913
02:05:34,660 --> 02:05:36,870
- Uh...
- Read the paper.

1914
02:05:38,580 --> 02:05:41,417
Does it say
something about it?

1915
02:05:41,500 --> 02:05:43,877
<i>It had a name...</i>

1916
02:05:44,002 --> 02:05:46,296
Caroline Avery.

1917
02:05:46,422 --> 02:05:48,716
She was 23 years old.

1918
02:05:50,384 --> 02:05:53,345
She'd been raped and then
smothered to death.

1919
02:05:54,847 --> 02:05:56,974
She was from Bakersfield.

1920
02:06:14,700 --> 02:06:16,285
Thank you.

1921
02:06:17,703 --> 02:06:20,581
Hey, baby.
Could I, uh, get a...

1922
02:06:27,212 --> 02:06:29,423
Some day, huh, buddy?

1923
02:06:36,555 --> 02:06:39,099
Earl, what are you
doing here?

1924
02:06:39,224 --> 02:06:42,061
I'm here to see you.
What else?

1925
02:06:46,065 --> 02:06:47,941
Baby, I've looked
everywhere for you.

1926
02:06:48,067 --> 02:06:50,361
I was at the trailer last night.
You weren't there.

1927
02:06:50,444 --> 02:06:53,530
Your car was there,
but you weren't there.

1928
02:06:53,614 --> 02:06:56,200
Honey, where you been sleeping?
Look at your hair.

1929
02:06:57,701 --> 02:07:00,913
I... I slept outside.

1930
02:07:02,664 --> 02:07:04,708
I didn't wanna
sleep in our bed.

1931
02:07:07,961 --> 02:07:10,214
People are looking.
You wanna order something?

1932
02:07:10,297 --> 02:07:14,259
Yeah. How about
you on a bed of rice?

1933
02:07:14,802 --> 02:07:16,720
Cut it out.

1934
02:07:18,806 --> 02:07:22,518
- You want a cup of coffee?
- Oh, yeah. Give me some coffee.

1935
02:07:23,644 --> 02:07:27,022
- How about an egg sandwich?
- With a broke yolk?

1936
02:07:27,106 --> 02:07:29,066
Yeah, with a broke yolk.

1937
02:07:35,072 --> 02:07:37,866
Thanks, baby.
How did you get here?

1938
02:07:37,950 --> 02:07:40,703
Peg brought me. I didn't wanna
use the car after what happened.

1939
02:07:40,786 --> 02:07:42,955
Yeah, right.

1940
02:07:43,038 --> 02:07:45,040
What time you gettin' off?

1941
02:07:48,001 --> 02:07:51,547
- About an hour.
- What do you say I chauffeur you around...

1942
02:07:51,630 --> 02:07:55,551
to the manner in which you are
soon to become accustomed?

1943
02:07:56,802 --> 02:08:00,347
- I'm sure.
- I'm getting us out of here, baby.

1944
02:08:01,140 --> 02:08:03,392
I'm getting us
out of Downey.

1945
02:08:03,475 --> 02:08:05,811
Till the wheels come off, baby.

1946
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:08,939
Till the wheels come off.

1947
02:08:16,321 --> 02:08:19,283
Is that a fine-lookin' woman
or what?

1948
02:08:19,366 --> 02:08:21,994
I beg your pardon?

1949
02:08:22,119 --> 02:08:24,747
How'd you like to be married
to something like that?

1950
02:08:26,373 --> 02:08:28,292
I am.

1951
02:08:47,519 --> 02:08:50,189
Mommy, Daddy.

1952
02:08:51,565 --> 02:08:52,983
Shit!

1953
02:08:54,526 --> 02:08:57,613
Ah, silly Daddy,
sleeping on Mommy.

1954
02:08:58,614 --> 02:09:01,658
Daddy, Austin's crying
and he woke me up.

1955
02:09:01,784 --> 02:09:04,703
- What is it?
- He misses Suzy.

1956
02:09:04,787 --> 02:09:07,247
Well, you go tell Austin...

1957
02:09:07,331 --> 02:09:08,749
to come in here, and Will too.

1958
02:09:08,874 --> 02:09:11,502
- I got some good news, a surprise.
- About Suzy?

1959
02:09:11,585 --> 02:09:14,546
Maybe. You go and get them
and bring 'em back here.

1960
02:09:14,630 --> 02:09:16,632
Will, Austin!

1961
02:09:16,715 --> 02:09:18,675
Wake up, wake up.

1962
02:09:28,811 --> 02:09:30,646
Okay.

1963
02:09:36,985 --> 02:09:39,905
Come here. It's okay.
It's gonna be all right. Listen.

1964
02:09:40,030 --> 02:09:41,907
- Kids, can you keep a secret?
- Yeah.

1965
02:09:42,032 --> 02:09:43,033
Okay.

1966
02:09:43,117 --> 02:09:44,785
Daddy did something last night
he shouldn't have done.

1967
02:09:44,868 --> 02:09:46,161
That's why you have
to keep it a secret.

1968
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:49,748
Daddy went down to the police station
and put an A.P.B. Out on Suzy.

1969
02:09:49,832 --> 02:09:50,666
An A.P.B.?

1970
02:09:50,749 --> 02:09:53,377
You're not supposed to put A.P.B.'s
out on dogs, but I did it.

1971
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:56,255
And I got a call this morning.

1972
02:09:56,380 --> 02:09:58,632
I think they think
they know where Suzy is.

1973
02:09:58,757 --> 02:10:01,552
- Really?
- Yes. And as soon as I have my coffee...

1974
02:10:01,635 --> 02:10:03,762
I'm gonna go down and
see if I can find her, okay?

1975
02:10:03,887 --> 02:10:05,848
- Now you guys go and get dressed.
- I wanna go with you.

1976
02:10:05,931 --> 02:10:08,851
No. You go get dressed, and we'll see
if we can't find our little doggy.

1977
02:10:08,934 --> 02:10:11,061
Put your clothes on, Will.
Do what your dad says.

1978
02:10:17,276 --> 02:10:20,070
Gene, not now.
The kids will...

1979
02:10:20,154 --> 02:10:21,905
Oh.

1980
02:10:23,949 --> 02:10:27,411
<i>There's a line of prose from
the writings of St. Teresa...</i>

1981
02:10:27,536 --> 02:10:31,540
<i>which seemed more and more
appropriate as I thought toward this.</i>

1982
02:10:31,623 --> 02:10:34,293
<i>So I want to offer a
meditation on the sentence.</i>

1983
02:10:35,335 --> 02:10:40,716
<i>St. Teresa, that extraordinary woman
who lived 373 years ago...</i>

1984
02:10:40,799 --> 02:10:44,595
<i>said, "Words lead to deeds.</i>

1985
02:10:44,720 --> 02:10:47,848
<i>"They prepare the soul,
make it ready...</i>

1986
02:10:47,973 --> 02:10:50,267
<i>and move it to tenderness."</i>

1987
02:10:50,350 --> 02:10:55,064
<i>There's a clarity and beauty in that
thought expressed in just this way.</i>

1988
02:10:55,147 --> 02:10:58,233
<i>There's also something
a little foreign in the sentiment...</i>

1989
02:10:58,317 --> 02:11:00,861
<i>coming to our attention
in these times...</i>

1990
02:11:07,493 --> 02:11:10,913
How are you today, sir?
My name is Aubrey Bell.

1991
02:11:11,955 --> 02:11:13,749
- You must be Mr. Weathers.
- Yeah.

1992
02:11:13,832 --> 02:11:16,043
I have something here for
Mrs. Weathers. She won something.

1993
02:11:16,168 --> 02:11:19,588
- Is Mrs. Weathers home?
- Oh, she's not at home.

1994
02:11:19,671 --> 02:11:21,757
- What did she win?
- I'll have to show you. May I come in?

1995
02:11:21,840 --> 02:11:24,468
I'm kind of busy right now.
Tell me what it is.

1996
02:11:24,551 --> 02:11:29,014
She won a free vacuuming and
carpet shampoo, no strings attached.

1997
02:11:29,098 --> 02:11:30,808
I'll even do your mattress.

1998
02:11:30,891 --> 02:11:35,938
You'd be surprised what could build up under
a mattress over the months, over the years.

1999
02:11:36,021 --> 02:11:37,981
- Same with the pillows.
- Really?

2000
02:11:38,065 --> 02:11:39,983
Yes, sir.
This is your lucky day.

2001
02:11:52,705 --> 02:11:56,333
Well, I can see you've had
some kind of problem here.

2002
02:11:56,458 --> 02:11:58,794
That doesn't affect
my work any.

2003
02:11:58,877 --> 02:12:01,171
I've seen about everything
there is to see.

2004
02:12:27,072 --> 02:12:30,951
- So, what do you want to do today?
- Maybe go to the beach.

2005
02:12:31,368 --> 02:12:34,079
No way.
Who's gonna drive us?

2006
02:12:34,163 --> 02:12:38,250
- I don't know. Let's go look at the cop.
- Yeah, come on.

2007
02:12:38,333 --> 02:12:40,836
- Cops freak me out.
- He's looking at us.

2008
02:12:40,919 --> 02:12:42,963
- Oh, what is that cop doing?
- Hello, boys.

2009
02:12:43,088 --> 02:12:45,716
- Hi. What's the problem?
- No problem.

2010
02:12:45,799 --> 02:12:51,055
- I'm gonna have to take that dog, though.
- What... Take? Take? Dad! Dad!

2011
02:12:51,180 --> 02:12:53,515
<i>- Yeah? What's the matter?
- He's taking my dog.</i>

2012
02:12:53,599 --> 02:12:57,102
Hey, hey. Excuse me. Officer,
what's going on here anyway?

2013
02:12:57,770 --> 02:12:59,521
How long have you
had this dog, sir?

2014
02:12:59,605 --> 02:13:01,231
What the hell difference
does it make? It's my kid's dog.

2015
02:13:01,357 --> 02:13:04,151
I'm afraid I'm gonna have to take this dog,
sir. It's been missing for a couple of days.

2016
02:13:04,276 --> 02:13:07,071
- It's highly dangerous. It bit an infant.
- A police officer's taking the dog.

2017
02:13:07,154 --> 02:13:09,073
We have to check it for rabies.

2018
02:13:09,156 --> 02:13:11,075
It doesn't look sick to me.
You sure you got the right dog?

2019
02:13:11,158 --> 02:13:13,827
- It fits the description, sir.
- Please, sir. Don't take my dog.

2020
02:13:13,952 --> 02:13:16,914
I'm sorry, son. I have to.
It's for your own safety.

2021
02:13:16,997 --> 02:13:20,751
And kids, in the future,
if you find a lost dog, report it.

2022
02:13:20,834 --> 02:13:23,504
Every animal has
their rightful owner.

2023
02:13:23,629 --> 02:13:26,423
- Don't let him take my dog.
- Don't worry about it.
- In you go, Suzy.

2024
02:13:26,507 --> 02:13:30,135
Don't you have anything better to do
than take dogs away from kids?

2025
02:13:30,260 --> 02:13:34,765
Keep up with that lip, sir, I'm gonna
have to cite you for an open container.

2026
02:13:34,848 --> 02:13:37,142
Dad, aren't you gonna
do something?

2027
02:13:37,226 --> 02:13:39,520
- Aren't you gonna get him back?
- We'll get you a new dog.

2028
02:13:39,645 --> 02:13:41,397
- But I don't want a new dog.
- Let's get inside.

2029
02:13:41,480 --> 02:13:43,565
- Frisbee was special.
- Don't worry about it.

2030
02:14:24,690 --> 02:14:27,317
I've asked one of my
colleagues to come by.

2031
02:14:27,443 --> 02:14:30,070
We're not sure why
Casey's not responsive.

2032
02:14:30,195 --> 02:14:32,531
His CAT scan shows
the blood clot's still small...

2033
02:14:32,656 --> 02:14:34,950
but there's still
more brain swelling.

2034
02:14:35,034 --> 02:14:38,495
I'd like to suggest some minor surgery.
Intracranial pressure monitor.

2035
02:14:38,620 --> 02:14:41,081
- Oh, God.
- There's no cause for alarm.

2036
02:14:41,206 --> 02:14:43,083
Casey's making small
improvements in other areas.

2037
02:14:43,208 --> 02:14:45,919
His lungs have cleared up
substantially. That's a big plus.

2038
02:14:46,045 --> 02:14:48,172
Brian, the Negro boy in 111.

2039
02:14:48,255 --> 02:14:51,842
I think he was operated on yesterday.
Could I inquire about his condition?

2040
02:14:51,967 --> 02:14:53,886
- Oh, yeah. He's doing very well.
- Yeah?

2041
02:14:53,969 --> 02:14:57,723
He's out of critical condition. We'll be
taking him out of the I.C.U. Today.

2042
02:14:57,848 --> 02:14:59,475
Oh, that's nice.
Thanks.

2043
02:14:59,558 --> 02:15:01,477
Excuse me just one minute.

2044
02:15:02,978 --> 02:15:07,733
- Excuse me. What exactly is a diuretic?
- It makes him urinate more.

2045
02:15:07,858 --> 02:15:12,529
- I see. So, that's to alleviate pressure?
- Casey. Casey, please wake up.

2046
02:15:12,613 --> 02:15:14,531
- Yeah, okay. I'll be right there.
- Dr. Wyman.

2047
02:15:14,615 --> 02:15:18,285
I wanted to thank you for saving
my son's life. You are a miracle worker.

2048
02:15:18,410 --> 02:15:20,287
- That's my job.
- He'll have a minor surgery?

2049
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:23,374
Nurse, are you clear about this?
Mr. Finnigan, I'm sorry, I...

2050
02:15:23,457 --> 02:15:25,834
Hey, Knute. I just
was hearing the good news.

2051
02:15:25,918 --> 02:15:28,420
Congratulations.
I can't tell you how pleased I am.

2052
02:15:28,504 --> 02:15:32,257
Thank you very much. I mean,
everybody has been so nice.

2053
02:15:32,341 --> 02:15:34,051
Casey.

2054
02:15:34,134 --> 02:15:37,221
Casey, we love you, honey.
Please wake up.

2055
02:15:37,304 --> 02:15:41,266
Any change in my grandson
that you know of? I mean...

2056
02:15:41,350 --> 02:15:43,852
I'm sorry. I don't have
any additional information.

2057
02:15:43,936 --> 02:15:48,148
Casey. Casey?

2058
02:15:48,273 --> 02:15:50,401
Hey, sweetie.

2059
02:15:50,567 --> 02:15:52,653
Hey, sweetie.

2060
02:15:52,778 --> 02:15:55,197
Casey. Howard!

2061
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,408
- How's your little boy?
- Howard, Casey's waking up.

2062
02:15:57,491 --> 02:15:59,076
Look, his eyes are open.

2063
02:16:00,452 --> 02:16:02,371
- Hey, sweetie.
- Hey, Case.

2064
02:16:02,454 --> 02:16:06,333
Hey, Case. Hey, buddy.
How you doing?

2065
02:16:06,458 --> 02:16:08,544
Hey, can you hear me?

2066
02:16:08,627 --> 02:16:10,379
Hi, son.

2067
02:16:10,462 --> 02:16:13,966
- Hey, Casey.
- Case?

2068
02:16:14,091 --> 02:16:16,885
Casey. Hey, Case,
can you hear...

2069
02:16:16,969 --> 02:16:20,055
Howard. Howard, what's that?
Howard, what's happening?

2070
02:16:20,139 --> 02:16:23,350
Ca... Nurse! Nurse!
Come here!

2071
02:16:23,434 --> 02:16:25,811
- Howard, do something!
- Hurry up. Hurry up.

2072
02:16:25,936 --> 02:16:28,522
- Come here. I don't think he's breathing here.
- Casey, are you all right?

2073
02:16:28,647 --> 02:16:30,691
He opened his eyes
and then he stopped breathing.

2074
02:16:30,774 --> 02:16:33,027
Call a code blue and get me
some help in here immediately.

2075
02:16:33,110 --> 02:16:35,696
<i>- Can you hear me, son? Casey?
- Code blue. I.C.U.</i>

2076
02:16:35,779 --> 02:16:38,574
I need you to clear the room.
I need to make some space.

2077
02:16:38,657 --> 02:16:39,783
Let the doctors work. Please.

2078
02:16:39,867 --> 02:16:43,328
- We have to go clear the room.
- No!

2079
02:16:43,454 --> 02:16:45,539
Come on. We'll wait outside.
We'll be right outside.

2080
02:16:45,664 --> 02:16:47,708
Just give them room.
Just give them room to work.

2081
02:16:47,833 --> 02:16:51,128
- Just give them room to work.
- Get the bed and pull it out for me.

2082
02:16:52,504 --> 02:16:54,590
Mrs. Finnigan, I'm sure you'd be more
comfortable. You don't wanna...

2083
02:16:54,673 --> 02:16:56,383
Get out of here!

2084
02:17:00,304 --> 02:17:02,347
Let's put him up on this.

2085
02:17:05,768 --> 02:17:08,937
- Oh!
- Can we get the thallium?

2086
02:17:09,021 --> 02:17:12,691
Nothing. No. 4 of
epinephrine, please.

2087
02:17:12,775 --> 02:17:16,111
- After that, you can draw up. 4 of atropine.
- Excuse me. Excuse me.

2088
02:17:16,195 --> 02:17:18,113
Start C.P.R.

2089
02:17:19,323 --> 02:17:21,617
Okay, atropine ready.

2090
02:17:23,035 --> 02:17:24,745
How long we been doing this?

2091
02:17:24,870 --> 02:17:26,747
- Uh, two minutes.
- Good.

2092
02:17:31,043 --> 02:17:32,378
Check for pulse.

2093
02:17:45,432 --> 02:17:47,559
<i>How long?</i>

2094
02:17:48,560 --> 02:17:50,062
<i>I'll continue C.P.R.</i>

2095
02:18:22,261 --> 02:18:24,388
I can't believe it.
Can you?

2096
02:18:25,431 --> 02:18:28,684
She was just over at
my apartment two weeks ago.

2097
02:18:28,767 --> 02:18:30,686
Do you know her from work?

2098
02:18:33,439 --> 02:18:37,067
- Did you sign the guest book?
- No. No, not yet.

2099
02:18:37,151 --> 02:18:38,944
Excuse me.

2100
02:19:09,808 --> 02:19:12,853
<i>- Zoe, Zoe, Zoe.
- Let's go, Zoe. Zoe.</i>

2101
02:19:14,480 --> 02:19:16,482
Mrs. Finnigan!

2102
02:19:18,233 --> 02:19:19,818
How's Casey?

2103
02:19:34,958 --> 02:19:37,503
Casey didn't make it, Zoe.

2104
02:19:37,628 --> 02:19:40,923
Come on, honey.
Come on. Let's go.

2105
02:20:00,025 --> 02:20:03,320
Well, I filled out an application
about two weeks ago.

2106
02:20:03,445 --> 02:20:06,073
A Mr. Walsh told me
to call him in case I hadn't heard.

2107
02:20:06,198 --> 02:20:08,283
Well, I've been away
on family business.

2108
02:20:08,367 --> 02:20:10,994
<i>- Please hold a minute.
- Okay. All right. I'll hold.</i>

2109
02:20:11,120 --> 02:20:13,038
Where you been all day?

2110
02:20:14,540 --> 02:20:18,293
- What time is it?
- I asked you where you been.

2111
02:20:18,585 --> 02:20:21,714
<i>Sir, give me your number, and
I'll have Mr. Walsh get back to you.</i>

2112
02:20:21,797 --> 02:20:24,550
Yeah, well, it's 504-0361.

2113
02:20:24,633 --> 02:20:27,219
<i>- But it should be on the application.
- Okay, I'll tell him you called.</i>

2114
02:20:27,344 --> 02:20:29,304
Okay, thank you.

2115
02:20:39,982 --> 02:20:42,317
So this is what it's
gonna be, huh?

2116
02:20:43,402 --> 02:20:45,779
Oh, yeah.

2117
02:20:45,904 --> 02:20:47,906
We have to be there
at 7:00, you know.

2118
02:20:47,990 --> 02:20:49,533
You don't have very much time.

2119
02:20:49,616 --> 02:20:52,119
<i>- What's the big deal? It's just a barbecue.
- Personnel.</i>

2120
02:20:52,202 --> 02:20:54,663
- This is Stuart Kane.
- You made the date, Stuart.

2121
02:20:54,747 --> 02:20:55,622
With a "K".

2122
02:20:55,706 --> 02:20:58,876
Aren't you the big sportsman
who's supposed to be bringing the fish?

2123
02:20:59,668 --> 02:21:01,253
Why are they always naked?

2124
02:21:02,504 --> 02:21:05,924
Why does naked make it art?

2125
02:21:06,050 --> 02:21:09,344
- Did you make me a drink?
- It's in the blender.

2126
02:21:17,519 --> 02:21:19,813
It smells strong.

2127
02:21:19,938 --> 02:21:21,815
I'm gonna have some wine.

2128
02:21:21,940 --> 02:21:25,069
- Is that what you're wearing?
- Yes.

2129
02:21:25,152 --> 02:21:27,071
I thought we were
cooking out.

2130
02:21:27,154 --> 02:21:30,157
Stuart's bringing fish,
remember?

2131
02:21:30,240 --> 02:21:32,659
Well, if it's just a barbecue,
why are you getting dressed up?

2132
02:21:32,743 --> 02:21:35,788
- This isn't dressed up.
- I'm not changing.

2133
02:21:35,913 --> 02:21:37,915
She'll probably dress up.

2134
02:21:39,041 --> 02:21:42,252
- Are you competing?
- Competing with who?

2135
02:21:42,378 --> 02:21:44,713
Claire, honey.
We're talking about Claire.

2136
02:21:44,797 --> 02:21:47,299
- Are you completing with Claire?
- For what?

2137
02:21:47,383 --> 02:21:49,676
What women
compete for, I guess.

2138
02:21:49,802 --> 02:21:52,096
- Do you think he's attractive?
- Who?

2139
02:21:52,179 --> 02:21:54,973
- The husband.
- Stuart is.

2140
02:21:55,099 --> 02:21:57,893
He's the kind of guy
women find attractive, isn't he?

2141
02:21:57,976 --> 02:22:01,230
- The outdoorsman type.
- We don't know a lot about them.

2142
02:22:01,355 --> 02:22:04,650
I hope they like something
other than chamber music.

2143
02:22:04,775 --> 02:22:08,195
Isn't it wonderful, Marian,
how we can skate around an issue...

2144
02:22:08,278 --> 02:22:10,114
always playing our little game?

2145
02:22:10,197 --> 02:22:12,825
That's a good idea, a game.

2146
02:22:12,908 --> 02:22:16,495
Might help break the ice.
Jeopardy, maybe.

2147
02:22:16,620 --> 02:22:19,581
I'm talking about us.
I'm talking about now.

2148
02:22:20,833 --> 02:22:24,253
- What about us?
- You know.

2149
02:22:24,336 --> 02:22:26,255
Know what?

2150
02:22:27,840 --> 02:22:29,591
Let's forget it.

2151
02:22:30,759 --> 02:22:33,929
Forget what?
What are you talking about?

2152
02:22:34,012 --> 02:22:36,265
- It's nothing. It's ancient history.
- No.

2153
02:22:37,349 --> 02:22:39,268
Something's on your mind.

2154
02:22:40,310 --> 02:22:44,857
- That party.
- What party?

2155
02:22:44,982 --> 02:22:48,193
You know what party I'm talking about,
Marian. The one with Mitchell Anderson.

2156
02:22:48,277 --> 02:22:50,863
Jesus, Ralph.
That was three years ago.

2157
02:22:50,946 --> 02:22:52,406
- You kissed him, didn't you?
- No!

2158
02:22:52,531 --> 02:22:56,660
- Your lipstick was smeared when you came back.
- How would you know? You were drunk!

2159
02:22:56,744 --> 02:23:00,164
Jesus Christ, look at this.
Goddamn it! Look at this!

2160
02:23:00,247 --> 02:23:02,791
Look what you made me do!
Goddamn it!

2161
02:23:02,875 --> 02:23:04,460
I wanted to wear this.

2162
02:23:06,712 --> 02:23:10,799
That's the way you looked that night with
Mitchell Anderson when you were out necking.

2163
02:23:10,883 --> 02:23:12,760
- He kissed you, didn't he?
- Come on, Ralph.

2164
02:23:12,885 --> 02:23:15,387
I thought we were
through with that.

2165
02:23:15,512 --> 02:23:18,182
I want you to tell me about
that night with Mitchell Anderson.

2166
02:23:18,265 --> 02:23:20,225
- There's nothing to tell.
- All right.

2167
02:23:20,309 --> 02:23:23,979
Then tell me about nothingness. I'd like
to hear a complete account of nothing...

2168
02:23:24,063 --> 02:23:26,231
what you didn't do
for two and a half hours.

2169
02:23:26,315 --> 02:23:29,443
Why, Ralph? What's so important?
It was three years ago.

2170
02:23:29,568 --> 02:23:31,987
All right, it's not important.
It's water under the bridge.

2171
02:23:32,071 --> 02:23:35,282
But what irritates me, Marian...
if that's the right word for it...

2172
02:23:35,407 --> 02:23:37,534
is that you won't
tell me the truth.

2173
02:23:37,618 --> 02:23:40,996
You can't say the obvious.
You can't admit that you lied!

2174
02:23:41,121 --> 02:23:44,291
That's what I don't like, Marian,
having to play this charade.

2175
02:23:44,416 --> 02:23:46,752
God, Ralph.
How did this start?

2176
02:23:46,877 --> 02:23:48,504
Do you know how this started?

2177
02:23:48,587 --> 02:23:50,005
'Cause I really...

2178
02:23:50,089 --> 02:23:52,341
- I really don't know how this started.
- Marian, look at me!

2179
02:23:52,424 --> 02:23:55,052
- You don't have any panties on.
- Do you know how this started?

2180
02:23:55,135 --> 02:23:57,763
What do you think you are,
one of your goddamn paintings?

2181
02:24:00,099 --> 02:24:02,393
Marian, I'm giving you
a chance to come clean...

2182
02:24:02,476 --> 02:24:05,604
clear the slate, on to
a higher consciousness.

2183
02:24:05,687 --> 02:24:08,524
And then, don't ever
lie to me again, Marian.

2184
02:24:08,607 --> 02:24:12,736
- This is not like you, Ralph.
- What, to demand? You're right, Marian.

2185
02:24:12,820 --> 02:24:15,114
But I wanna know.
I wanna know the truth.

2186
02:24:15,239 --> 02:24:18,701
- We're just talking, right?
- Yes, Marian. We're just talking!

2187
02:24:18,826 --> 02:24:23,622
- You want me to tell you the truth?
- That's all I've ever asked, Marian.

2188
02:24:23,706 --> 02:24:25,249
Okay.

2189
02:24:29,628 --> 02:24:32,214
He kissed me.

2190
02:24:32,297 --> 02:24:34,508
Does that satisfy you?

2191
02:24:34,591 --> 02:24:35,676
Did it satisfy you?

2192
02:24:35,759 --> 02:24:37,761
Everybody was pretty far gone,
as you may or may not know.

2193
02:24:37,845 --> 02:24:40,347
Marian, I don't really need
all this perspective, just the facts.

2194
02:24:40,389 --> 02:24:43,016
All right.
All right, Ralph. Okay.

2195
02:24:43,142 --> 02:24:47,813
Somehow... Somehow the two of us
were elected to go out and get liquor.

2196
02:24:47,938 --> 02:24:49,773
We drove to the Foremost,
which was closed...

2197
02:24:49,898 --> 02:24:51,775
and then to Cappy's,
which was also closed.

2198
02:24:51,859 --> 02:24:52,901
In fact, everything was closed.

2199
02:24:52,943 --> 02:24:55,571
I mean, I was beginning to wonder
whether anything would be open...

2200
02:24:55,654 --> 02:24:58,490
and all I could think of were those
all-night supermarkets, and...

2201
02:24:59,908 --> 02:25:02,453
I wondered whether anybody
would even be in the mood for a drink...

2202
02:25:02,536 --> 02:25:06,331
if we had to drive around half the night
looking for an open market.

2203
02:25:06,415 --> 02:25:07,958
He was really drunk.

2204
02:25:08,083 --> 02:25:10,878
I hadn't even realized how drunk he was
until we started driving.

2205
02:25:11,003 --> 02:25:13,797
And he was driving...
he was driving terribly slow.

2206
02:25:13,881 --> 02:25:16,717
He was all hunched over
the wheel, and we were talking.

2207
02:25:16,842 --> 02:25:18,886
We were talking about
a lot of things...

2208
02:25:19,970 --> 02:25:21,138
A lot of things that
didn't make sense...

2209
02:25:21,221 --> 02:25:23,515
I mean, about, uh,
religious images...

2210
02:25:23,640 --> 02:25:26,060
and about this...

2211
02:25:26,185 --> 02:25:28,645
about this painter,
this painter named Larry Rivers.

2212
02:25:28,729 --> 02:25:32,483
And, uh... And then he started
talking about Norman Mailer...

2213
02:25:32,566 --> 02:25:38,030
and about how Norman Mailer
stabbed his wife in the breast.

2214
02:25:38,155 --> 02:25:41,575
And he said he'd hate it
if anybody did that to me.

2215
02:25:42,701 --> 02:25:44,787
He said he'd like
to kiss my breast.

2216
02:25:44,870 --> 02:25:48,999
And then he pulled the car over
to the side of the road, and...

2217
02:25:49,083 --> 02:25:50,292
then he kissed me.

2218
02:25:52,753 --> 02:25:54,546
How long?

2219
02:25:59,718 --> 02:26:01,637
How long what?

2220
02:26:01,720 --> 02:26:03,639
How long did he kiss you?

2221
02:26:09,895 --> 02:26:11,647
Then what?

2222
02:26:14,400 --> 02:26:16,985
Then he said,
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

2223
02:26:17,194 --> 02:26:20,114
Jesus, Marian.
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

2224
02:26:20,531 --> 02:26:23,951
What...
"Do you wanna have a go at it?

2225
02:26:24,076 --> 02:26:26,161
Do you wanna have a go at it?"

2226
02:26:26,245 --> 02:26:30,124
What does that mean, Marian?
"Do you wanna have a go at it?"

2227
02:26:30,249 --> 02:26:32,334
Did he kiss your tits?
Did you touch him?

2228
02:26:32,418 --> 02:26:35,212
Touch him? Touch him?

2229
02:26:35,337 --> 02:26:38,257
Okay, Ralph. Ralph, you wanna
know what happened?

2230
02:26:38,340 --> 02:26:40,384
He kissed me,
and I kissed him back.

2231
02:26:40,509 --> 02:26:43,011
And then we did it.
We did it right there in the car.

2232
02:26:43,095 --> 02:26:45,097
He fucked me
right there in the car.

2233
02:26:45,222 --> 02:26:47,433
I was drunk. It didn't
mean anything to me.

2234
02:26:47,558 --> 02:26:49,435
I wish it hadn't happened,
but it did.

2235
02:26:49,560 --> 02:26:53,105
Is that all? Is that all
you wanna know? Is that all?

2236
02:27:00,612 --> 02:27:02,531
Yes, Marian.

2237
02:27:04,908 --> 02:27:07,369
- That's all.
- Ralph, he didn't come in me.

2238
02:27:07,494 --> 02:27:08,912
I swear to God,

2239
02:27:08,996 --> 02:27:11,749
- he didn't come in me.
- Okay.

2240
02:27:11,832 --> 02:27:14,043
Where are you going, Ralph?

2241
02:27:15,753 --> 02:27:20,215
Well, Marian, we have guests coming,
and I'm gonna go and light the barbecue.

2242
02:27:26,638 --> 02:27:29,058
<i>Each day</i>

2243
02:27:30,476 --> 02:27:32,853
<i>Just about sunset</i>

2244
02:27:34,480 --> 02:27:36,607
<i>I watch you</i>

2245
02:27:37,232 --> 02:27:39,860
<i>Passing my door</i>

2246
02:27:41,737 --> 02:27:44,740
<i>It's all I can do</i>

2247
02:27:45,783 --> 02:27:48,869
<i>Not to run to you</i>

2248
02:27:49,912 --> 02:27:52,081
<i>- We're closed.
- But I don't wanna cry</i>

2249
02:27:52,164 --> 02:27:54,500
- Can I help you?
- No, I just came to talk to my mom.

2250
02:27:54,625 --> 02:27:57,252
- Who's your mom?
- That's my mom.

2251
02:27:57,336 --> 02:27:59,254
<i>Nighttime</i>

2252
02:28:01,090 --> 02:28:03,801
- Who's that?
- She says she's Tess's kid.

2253
02:28:03,884 --> 02:28:05,803
You're kidding me.
A string player?

2254
02:28:05,886 --> 02:28:09,181
<i>The same old moon</i>

2255
02:28:09,306 --> 02:28:12,267
<i>We knew before</i>

2256
02:28:14,144 --> 02:28:17,106
<i>It's all I can do</i>

2257
02:28:18,315 --> 02:28:21,360
<i>Not to run to you</i>

2258
02:28:22,403 --> 02:28:24,738
Hold it.

2259
02:28:26,031 --> 02:28:28,450
What are you doing here, Zoe?

2260
02:28:29,326 --> 02:28:33,247
- Mom, Casey died.
- Casey? Who's that?

2261
02:28:33,372 --> 02:28:35,833
The little boy who lives
right next door.

2262
02:28:35,916 --> 02:28:39,420
- He got run over by a car.
- I'll be damned. Just like that?

2263
02:28:39,545 --> 02:28:41,505
Kids.

2264
02:28:43,006 --> 02:28:44,967
I just saw Mrs. Finnigan.

2265
02:28:46,051 --> 02:28:50,931
I feel so bad for them,
and I thought you'd wanna know.

2266
02:28:51,014 --> 02:28:52,725
It's a cryin' shame, baby.

2267
02:28:52,850 --> 02:28:54,727
- She must feel like shit.
- Mom.

2268
02:28:54,852 --> 02:28:57,730
Why don't you go sit over here?
We're just rehearsing.

2269
02:28:57,813 --> 02:28:59,940
- Okay, let's try it again.
- Mom...

2270
02:29:00,024 --> 02:29:01,525
From the top, okay?

2271
02:29:04,611 --> 02:29:07,364
<i>Each day</i>

2272
02:29:09,867 --> 02:29:12,536
<i>Just about sunset</i>

2273
02:29:13,996 --> 02:29:16,373
<i>I watch you</i>

2274
02:29:17,416 --> 02:29:19,710
<i>Passing my door</i>

2275
02:29:22,004 --> 02:29:25,507
<i>It's all I can do</i>

2276
02:29:25,591 --> 02:29:28,969
<i>Not to run to you</i>

2277
02:29:30,095 --> 02:29:34,224
<i>But I don't wanna cry</i>

2278
02:29:34,308 --> 02:29:37,227
<i>Anymore</i>

2279
02:29:47,446 --> 02:29:51,408
Suzy! Daddy,
you found Suzy!

2280
02:29:51,492 --> 02:29:55,204
- Suzy!
- Suzy, we missed you.

2281
02:29:55,287 --> 02:29:57,206
Suzy.

2282
02:30:00,042 --> 02:30:01,168
Suzy's here.

2283
02:30:01,293 --> 02:30:04,588
I missed you, Suzy.
I love you.

2284
02:30:06,757 --> 02:30:10,302
Daddy, why can't I
have a monkey?

2285
02:30:21,689 --> 02:30:24,108
Geez, I hate this
goddamn thing.

2286
02:30:24,233 --> 02:30:27,319
Well, if you'd get a job,
you could get your car fixed.

2287
02:30:28,529 --> 02:30:30,656
You sure this is
the right address?

2288
02:30:31,865 --> 02:30:34,159
We should've parked
about three blocks away.

2289
02:30:40,332 --> 02:30:42,459
- Hi.
- Come in. Come on in.

2290
02:30:42,543 --> 02:30:44,461
- We're not early, are we?
- No, not at all.

2291
02:30:44,545 --> 02:30:46,463
- Did you have any trouble finding the house?
- Not at all.

2292
02:30:46,547 --> 02:30:48,465
I got the fish. Where do you
want me to put this?

2293
02:30:48,549 --> 02:30:52,636
- Come on in. Just come right this way.
- Oh, wow.

2294
02:30:52,720 --> 02:30:55,681
- Ralph?
- Hi.

2295
02:30:56,682 --> 02:30:59,101
- Like a drink?
- Oh, thank you.

2296
02:30:59,184 --> 02:31:01,186
- How are you?
- Why don't we go out to the patio?

2297
02:31:01,270 --> 02:31:03,605
- Hello, Steven. How are you?
- Stuart.

2298
02:31:03,689 --> 02:31:05,816
- Right. I'm sorry, Stuart.
- Oh, wow. Look at these pictures.

2299
02:31:05,899 --> 02:31:08,652
- Where did you get them?
- Uh, they're mine. I painted them.

2300
02:31:08,736 --> 02:31:10,863
- You're kidding.
- Pia colada.

2301
02:31:10,988 --> 02:31:13,449
- Pia colada?
- How was the trip?

2302
02:31:13,574 --> 02:31:17,036
- Oh, not bad. Took the 405 to the 10...
- No, I meant the fishing trip.

2303
02:31:17,161 --> 02:31:19,038
Oh, it was great.

2304
02:31:20,456 --> 02:31:23,167
I got it right here. Want me to take it
to the kitchen or something, or...

2305
02:31:23,250 --> 02:31:25,335
Why don't we just take it out
the the barbecue?

2306
02:31:25,419 --> 02:31:27,671
Okay. Out here, huh?

2307
02:31:29,048 --> 02:31:31,467
- You like fishing?
- Oh, I love to fish.

2308
02:31:31,550 --> 02:31:32,760
- Uh-huh?
- Yeah.

2309
02:31:32,885 --> 02:31:35,721
- Is that your hobby, fishing?
- No, not really.

2310
02:31:35,846 --> 02:31:37,848
Uh, I do enjoy it though.

2311
02:31:37,931 --> 02:31:39,808
But I don't like fishing in boats
because I don't swim.

2312
02:31:39,892 --> 02:31:43,479
- So I'll go to lakes or rivers.
- I'll give you a tour. We can...

2313
02:31:43,562 --> 02:31:47,358
- start with the upstairs.
- Oh, look at this.

2314
02:31:47,483 --> 02:31:49,777
- I'll show you the bedrooms first.
- Okay.

2315
02:31:49,902 --> 02:31:52,529
<i>I don't get out
as much as I'd like to.</i>

2316
02:31:52,654 --> 02:31:55,157
<i>How about you?
You a fisherman?</i>

2317
02:32:17,429 --> 02:32:21,308
I'm sorry I had to do that,
but you just got out ofline.

2318
02:32:21,392 --> 02:32:22,309
Come on, Bill.

2319
02:32:22,393 --> 02:32:25,729
- And I know I'm just a gardener.
- I'm getting tired of this.

2320
02:32:25,813 --> 02:32:31,485
Good-bye. Oh, no, let me
fix it there for you. Don't.

2321
02:32:31,568 --> 02:32:34,113
- Bill, this has taken fucking hours.
- Yeah, well, you know.

2322
02:32:34,196 --> 02:32:36,782
- Come on.
- Stop it, stop it. Don't move.

2323
02:32:36,907 --> 02:32:38,867
I gotta go to the bathroom.
Don't lean on me like that.

2324
02:32:38,951 --> 02:32:42,204
- I'm taking this thing out till...
- No. Okay, okay.

2325
02:32:42,287 --> 02:32:43,956
- Just keep it in for the picture!
- Hold on a second.

2326
02:32:44,039 --> 02:32:46,333
Support your husband.

2327
02:32:46,458 --> 02:32:48,585
Now, look like I...
like someone really hurt you...

2328
02:32:48,669 --> 02:32:50,796
like Earl beat you.

2329
02:32:50,921 --> 02:32:52,381
- Thank you.
- Shut up.

2330
02:32:52,464 --> 02:32:54,258
- Did he?
- You know he didn't.

2331
02:32:54,383 --> 02:32:56,093
I know he didn't literally.
What else did he do?

2332
02:32:56,176 --> 02:32:57,845
What do you think about
when you think about Earl?

2333
02:32:57,886 --> 02:32:59,012
Can we stop?

2334
02:32:59,138 --> 02:33:01,390
I don't wanna talk
about that, okay?

2335
02:33:01,473 --> 02:33:03,350
- Come on, Bill. Let's get going.
- I was in the shower sometimes...

2336
02:33:03,392 --> 02:33:05,394
and I hear the sound of the water
going down the drain...

2337
02:33:05,436 --> 02:33:07,521
and I think it's somebody hurting you
in the other room and it scares me.

2338
02:33:07,646 --> 02:33:09,815
- Bill, come on.
- Open your blouse a little for this one.

2339
02:33:09,857 --> 02:33:12,067
- No, I don't do those shots.
- Come on, just for me.

2340
02:33:12,109 --> 02:33:14,653
I don't wanna do this anymore. I've been
doing this for... I've been very patient.

2341
02:33:14,778 --> 02:33:17,865
- I mean, I could've sped up the process.
- No.

2342
02:33:18,741 --> 02:33:21,285
I could've just done it my...
my quick version.

2343
02:33:21,368 --> 02:33:26,331
Just, crunch! Crack!

2344
02:33:28,333 --> 02:33:29,209
Please, let's...

2345
02:33:29,334 --> 02:33:32,671
- But I didn't, because I loved you so.
- I love you too.

2346
02:33:32,755 --> 02:33:35,466
Why did that excite me? I started getting
a little chubby when I was doing that.

2347
02:33:35,549 --> 02:33:38,260
That's weird. Okay,
this is my last request.

2348
02:33:38,343 --> 02:33:41,055
- That's it. I'm getting restless. I am.
- Okay. This is it, okay.

2349
02:33:41,180 --> 02:33:44,016
- Let's go. Where do you want this?
- Right under your armpit.

2350
02:33:44,141 --> 02:33:46,435
- This is it. I've been a sport.
- Okay.

2351
02:33:46,518 --> 02:33:49,104
- All right. It's perfect now.
- I want you to just hold this.

2352
02:33:49,146 --> 02:33:52,608
- You're dead, and your husband is a creep.
- All right. Okay, go.

2353
02:33:52,691 --> 02:33:55,361
- Do it. Do it. I'm ready.
- I love you.

2354
02:33:55,486 --> 02:33:59,531
I'm in sales. Hardware, primarily,
but I've sold about everything else.

2355
02:33:59,615 --> 02:34:01,992
- Clothes.
- I've never sold clothes.

2356
02:34:02,076 --> 02:34:04,078
That's what I'm saying,
everything but clothes.

2357
02:34:04,203 --> 02:34:06,580
- So you're retired?
- You know what? I'm almost set up here.

2358
02:34:06,705 --> 02:34:09,958
- I wish.
- Ralph, could you bring everybody to the table?

2359
02:34:10,042 --> 02:34:12,294
- Claire.
- I been...

2360
02:34:12,378 --> 02:34:14,880
- I been out of work for three months now.
- Stuart.

2361
02:34:14,963 --> 02:34:18,509
I mean, nobody seems to be
interested in salesmen anymore.

2362
02:34:18,592 --> 02:34:20,552
Everything's gonna
become self-serve.

2363
02:34:20,636 --> 02:34:23,472
Could you sit
over there with him?

2364
02:34:23,555 --> 02:34:25,557
Are you gonna be
Alex Trebek?

2365
02:34:25,641 --> 02:34:28,477
- Yes, I'm gonna be Alex Trebek.
- Salesmen will be kind of like the...

2366
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:29,895
middlemen everybody's
trying to cut out.

2367
02:34:29,978 --> 02:34:32,731
Well, on that note, why don't we just
go ahead and start the game?

2368
02:34:32,815 --> 02:34:35,484
- Claire, do you wanna pick a category?
- It's your buzzer.

2369
02:34:35,567 --> 02:34:38,904
"The Night Sky",
"Political Quotes", "Racy Movies"...

2370
02:34:38,987 --> 02:34:41,156
- Oh, "Racy Movies". "Racy Movies".
- "The Blues"...

2371
02:34:41,240 --> 02:34:43,867
Oh, my panties
are getting a little wet.

2372
02:34:45,452 --> 02:34:49,289
Oh, baby, why don't you
take your fingers...

2373
02:34:49,373 --> 02:34:52,501
and rub my hot, pink pussy?

2374
02:34:53,127 --> 02:34:55,921
Oh, yeah, right on my clit.

2375
02:34:56,046 --> 02:34:58,507
And now take your fingers
and put them inside me and...

2376
02:34:58,590 --> 02:35:01,969
Oh, yeah. Just fuck me
with your fingers, baby.

2377
02:35:02,052 --> 02:35:04,638
Oh, don't you
wanna go inside?

2378
02:35:04,722 --> 02:35:06,473
You wanna hear
how wet I am?

2379
02:35:11,603 --> 02:35:14,064
- What are you doing?
- Getting a roach.

2380
02:35:14,189 --> 02:35:16,483
That's how wet you
make my pussy, baby.

2381
02:35:17,693 --> 02:35:20,946
Oh, I really want you
to fuck me now.

2382
02:35:21,030 --> 02:35:24,450
I want you to go inside
with your big, hard cock.

2383
02:35:24,533 --> 02:35:25,909
Oh, but wait. Wait.

2384
02:35:25,993 --> 02:35:30,456
Make me beg for it.
Just tease my clit. Please, baby.

2385
02:35:30,581 --> 02:35:34,251
Oh, my legs are
spread so wide.

2386
02:35:34,334 --> 02:35:36,587
Oh, I feel you
fucking me so deep.

2387
02:35:36,670 --> 02:35:39,173
Oh, please, harder.

2388
02:35:39,256 --> 02:35:40,674
Harder.

2389
02:35:40,799 --> 02:35:43,886
Oh, I can feel your balls
against my ass, baby.

2390
02:35:43,969 --> 02:35:46,805
Oh, yeah. Oh, lift my legs
above your shoulders.

2391
02:35:46,930 --> 02:35:49,349
Yeah, just fuck me so hard.

2392
02:35:49,475 --> 02:35:51,351
Oh, I'm gonna come.

2393
02:36:07,659 --> 02:36:10,287
Sounded like you really got hot
talking to that guy.

2394
02:36:11,163 --> 02:36:15,250
Right. Did you give
Joe-Joe his eardrops?

2395
02:36:16,919 --> 02:36:18,962
Talking about his dick
and everything.

2396
02:36:20,255 --> 02:36:22,758
"Dick". I never say that word.

2397
02:36:22,883 --> 02:36:26,804
- Cock, whatever.
- I hate that word. "Dick".

2398
02:37:24,945 --> 02:37:27,614
<i>- Who is Mariette Hartley?
- That's right.</i>

2399
02:37:27,740 --> 02:37:29,616
<i>It's not really fair that I
should win all the time, is it?</i>

2400
02:37:29,742 --> 02:37:33,829
- Are you cheating, Ralph?
- No, Marian. You cheat, remember?

2401
02:37:33,912 --> 02:37:35,581
- Ooh.
- All right.

2402
02:37:35,706 --> 02:37:38,751
This time you be Alex Trebek now,
okay? Time to switch.

2403
02:37:38,834 --> 02:37:41,295
- Finished with this one. Let's switch.
- We're gonna switch places?

2404
02:37:41,420 --> 02:37:44,798
- Okay, Stuart, you have to sit in the middle.
- Does Alex Trebek cheat?

2405
02:37:44,923 --> 02:37:47,051
Move over.
You gotta be in the middle.

2406
02:37:49,011 --> 02:37:50,888
- Hey, hey, hey!
- Hey, hey, hey.

2407
02:37:51,013 --> 02:37:51,972
Here's the categories:

2408
02:37:52,056 --> 02:37:55,476
"Little Songs", "Celebrities",
"Gourmet Cooking", "Family Life"...

2409
02:37:55,601 --> 02:37:57,978
Gourmet cooking. Shit!

2410
02:37:58,604 --> 02:38:00,814
- Aw, shit!
- Oh, Jesus, Ralph!

2411
02:38:00,939 --> 02:38:03,359
- Oh, God.
- You said 10 minutes an inch, Stuart.

2412
02:38:03,442 --> 02:38:06,111
I did. The thickness,
not the length.

2413
02:38:06,236 --> 02:38:08,989
How about we have
another pia colada?

2414
02:38:55,828 --> 02:38:58,872
<i>You may mean me some good</i>

2415
02:39:00,833 --> 02:39:03,836
<i>You may mean me some harm</i>

2416
02:39:06,839 --> 02:39:09,174
<i>You may be a fire</i>

2417
02:39:11,510 --> 02:39:14,304
<i>You may be a false alarm</i>

2418
02:39:17,349 --> 02:39:19,977
<i>'Cause I don't know you</i>

2419
02:39:22,438 --> 02:39:25,107
<i>I don't know you</i>

2420
02:39:29,528 --> 02:39:35,034
<i>I don't know you</i>

2421
02:39:36,201 --> 02:39:38,287
I don't think you should talk
that way in front of the kids.

2422
02:39:38,370 --> 02:39:40,372
- They don't understand.
- How do you know?

2423
02:39:40,456 --> 02:39:42,791
It goes in one ear,
and it goes out the other.

2424
02:39:42,875 --> 02:39:46,170
You should be happy that I have a job
where I'm home all the time, you know.

2425
02:39:46,295 --> 02:39:48,756
We don't send them
to some funky day care.

2426
02:39:48,881 --> 02:39:50,841
I make damn good money.

2427
02:39:51,884 --> 02:39:55,512
Hey, did you collect
from the Ryans yet?

2428
02:39:55,637 --> 02:39:59,266
I don't want you servicing their pool,
you know, if they haven't paid.

2429
02:40:04,188 --> 02:40:06,648
How come you never
talk to me like that?

2430
02:40:06,732 --> 02:40:08,942
Like what?

2431
02:40:10,152 --> 02:40:12,946
Like the way you
talk those guys off.

2432
02:40:13,072 --> 02:40:14,990
Are you kidding me?

2433
02:40:17,201 --> 02:40:19,078
Well, that might
spice things up.

2434
02:40:20,454 --> 02:40:24,249
Look, you wanna fuck me, fuck me.
I'm just a little talked out, you know.

2435
02:40:26,627 --> 02:40:28,962
Shit. Can you get this for me?

2436
02:40:31,173 --> 02:40:34,468
Jerry, big bear.

2437
02:40:34,593 --> 02:40:36,637
Did I hurt your feelings?

2438
02:40:36,762 --> 02:40:39,014
- Look at me.
- No.

2439
02:40:39,098 --> 02:40:41,392
- Look at me.
- It's all right. Let me just get this.

2440
02:40:42,935 --> 02:40:46,230
I'm so glad Joe-Joe got your eyes.
You know that?

2441
02:40:49,316 --> 02:40:51,944
You wanna fuck? Hmm?

2442
02:40:52,986 --> 02:40:56,073
Yeah, let's fuck. Come on.
We can fuck.

2443
02:40:58,200 --> 02:41:02,246
Oh, shit. Wait a minute.
Sorry, I... The TV.

2444
02:41:02,371 --> 02:41:04,248
Be right back.

2445
02:41:22,099 --> 02:41:24,560
<i>My little puppy's name is Rags</i>

2446
02:41:24,685 --> 02:41:27,521
<i>He eats so much
that his tummy sags</i>

2447
02:41:27,646 --> 02:41:30,441
<i>His ears flip-flop
and his tail wig-wags</i>

2448
02:41:30,524 --> 02:41:33,152
<i>He walks back and forth
in a big zigzag</i>

2449
02:41:33,277 --> 02:41:35,571
I mean, being a doctor and all...

2450
02:41:35,654 --> 02:41:37,740
do you touch many
dead bodies?

2451
02:41:37,823 --> 02:41:39,867
<i>Wig-wag, zigzag</i>

2452
02:41:39,992 --> 02:41:43,620
<i>- He doesn't have any pedigree
- That's kind of a strange question, isn't it?</i>

2453
02:41:43,704 --> 02:41:45,748
<i>But I love him and he loves me</i>

2454
02:41:47,583 --> 02:41:49,376
Come on, it's your turn.

2455
02:41:49,793 --> 02:41:51,462
You know, a little makeup,
a little costume.

2456
02:41:51,545 --> 02:41:53,047
Oh, no.

2457
02:41:53,130 --> 02:41:55,591
A littler weird behavior.
Isn't that what it's all about?

2458
02:41:55,674 --> 02:41:57,968
Don't look at me
like that, Stuart.

2459
02:41:58,093 --> 02:42:00,554
It's always me underneath.
You know, I can change.

2460
02:42:00,679 --> 02:42:03,015
But I can always
go back to me.

2461
02:42:03,098 --> 02:42:06,101
- Don't you wish you could do that?
- Marian, what have you got on underneath?

2462
02:42:06,185 --> 02:42:08,312
You know, Ralph. Nothing.

2463
02:42:08,395 --> 02:42:10,439
So what do you wanna be?

2464
02:42:10,564 --> 02:42:13,776
- I wanna be nothing.
- And I'm gonna make you...

2465
02:42:13,859 --> 02:42:15,736
a pussycat.

2466
02:42:15,819 --> 02:42:18,364
- Wait, does this stuff come off?
- Oh, sure.

2467
02:42:18,489 --> 02:42:21,658
Well, I know how to do nothing.
We'll just erase your face.

2468
02:42:23,702 --> 02:42:27,373
<i>In a setting by the woods</i>

2469
02:42:27,498 --> 02:42:31,627
<i>A little man by the river stood</i>

2470
02:42:31,710 --> 02:42:35,964
<i>Saw a girl come floating by</i>

2471
02:42:36,048 --> 02:42:39,510
<i>And he heard her cry</i>

2472
02:42:39,635 --> 02:42:42,763
"Help me, help me, help me",
she said.

2473
02:42:42,888 --> 02:42:45,599
He couldn't help her.
She was dead.

2474
02:42:51,397 --> 02:42:53,899
I know who it was.

2475
02:42:53,982 --> 02:42:55,526
The baker.

2476
02:42:55,651 --> 02:42:58,654
- What, honey?
- Casey's birthday gift.

2477
02:43:03,242 --> 02:43:05,452
- Howard.
- What? What is it?

2478
02:43:05,536 --> 02:43:08,372
- I know who made the phone calls.
- Who?

2479
02:43:08,455 --> 02:43:10,457
The baker, Mr. Bitkower.

2480
02:43:10,582 --> 02:43:13,377
- Oh, sweetie.
- Stop. Don't do that.

2481
02:43:28,517 --> 02:43:31,395
<i>I don't know you well</i>

2482
02:43:36,942 --> 02:43:41,739
<i>I don't know you at all</i>

2483
02:43:44,116 --> 02:43:46,410
<i>I don't know you</i>

2484
02:43:48,162 --> 02:43:51,081
<i>I don't know you</i>

2485
02:43:53,125 --> 02:43:56,462
<i>I don't know you</i>

2486
02:43:59,048 --> 02:44:01,884
You know, my mother
was an artist, sort of.

2487
02:44:02,926 --> 02:44:07,181
She always said I should draw
or that I could, but... I don't know.

2488
02:44:10,392 --> 02:44:14,605
You know, when I was in
art school, I had a teacher.

2489
02:44:15,898 --> 02:44:18,567
Eventually killed himself.
He couldn't sell anything.

2490
02:44:20,235 --> 02:44:23,530
But he used to have us paint
with sticks and rocks...

2491
02:44:24,698 --> 02:44:27,951
whatever you could find, like...
like cavemen or something.

2492
02:44:28,077 --> 02:44:30,079
I guess it was
supposed to be like...

2493
02:44:31,497 --> 02:44:37,127
He never allowed brushes
or pencils or... or real paint...

2494
02:44:37,252 --> 02:44:39,213
the paint you
could buy, anyway...

2495
02:44:40,881 --> 02:44:43,967
just to get you to feel,
or something.

2496
02:44:45,928 --> 02:44:47,262
I've forgotten.

2497
02:45:25,217 --> 02:45:28,387
Zoe! Zoe, don't do this to me.

2498
02:45:29,555 --> 02:45:31,682
Zoe!

2499
02:45:40,566 --> 02:45:42,484
No!

2500
02:45:47,406 --> 02:45:49,825
Oh, baby. Oh, my God.

2501
02:45:55,748 --> 02:45:58,417
Oh, baby. Oh, baby.

2502
02:45:58,542 --> 02:46:01,837
Oh! No. Zoe, no.

2503
02:46:15,434 --> 02:46:18,520
I'm not open yet.
The bakery's closed for business.

2504
02:46:18,604 --> 02:46:21,357
We can see you're closed,
but I'm sure you'll see us.

2505
02:46:21,940 --> 02:46:23,692
Mr. Bitkower!

2506
02:46:24,401 --> 02:46:27,237
Mr. Bitkower!

2507
02:46:33,911 --> 02:46:36,163
- Hey, you're not allowed in here.
- Mr. Bitkower.

2508
02:46:36,288 --> 02:46:38,999
- What do you want?
- I'm Casey's mother. This is Casey's father.

2509
02:46:39,083 --> 02:46:41,043
I'm busy.
You come back when I'm open.

2510
02:46:41,168 --> 02:46:44,296
- No.
- All right.

2511
02:46:44,380 --> 02:46:46,632
You want your cake now. Is that it?
You finally want the cake you ordered?

2512
02:46:46,757 --> 02:46:48,884
We wanna talk to you about
the cake that wasn't picked up.

2513
02:46:48,967 --> 02:46:51,261
- Or paid for.
- You're a terrible person, Mr. Bitkower.

2514
02:46:51,345 --> 02:46:53,555
It cost me time and money
to make that cake.

2515
02:46:53,639 --> 02:46:55,224
I have work to do.
I don't wanna talk to you.

2516
02:46:55,307 --> 02:46:57,434
You're gonna talk to her, or I'm
gonna knock you on your ass, pal.

2517
02:46:57,476 --> 02:47:02,022
- How can you be so cheap and insensitive?
- Lady, I work 16 hours a day to make ends meet.

2518
02:47:02,147 --> 02:47:05,192
- I bake all night and work all day.
- Oh, you bake all night?

2519
02:47:06,652 --> 02:47:09,405
I thought you made phone calls
at night, you bastard.

2520
02:47:11,323 --> 02:47:14,910
I'll call somebody.
Get out of my store.

2521
02:47:17,162 --> 02:47:19,665
I don't want any
trouble here.

2522
02:47:22,501 --> 02:47:24,628
My son is dead.

2523
02:47:25,963 --> 02:47:28,215
He is dead, Mr. Bitkower.

2524
02:47:28,298 --> 02:47:31,927
He was hit by a car the day
I came in here to order the cake.

2525
02:47:32,010 --> 02:47:35,431
We have been waiting
with him until he died.

2526
02:47:35,514 --> 02:47:38,475
And now he is dead.

2527
02:47:38,559 --> 02:47:41,687
There are no more birthdays.

2528
02:47:44,148 --> 02:47:46,025
He is dead!

2529
02:47:46,150 --> 02:47:50,279
You bastard! You bastard!
Goddamn you!

2530
02:47:50,362 --> 02:47:52,364
- Goddamn you!
- Come on.

2531
02:47:52,489 --> 02:47:55,909
- Goddamn you!
- Shame on you.

2532
02:47:57,327 --> 02:47:58,871
Shame.

2533
02:48:05,252 --> 02:48:08,088
Wait. Wait, don't go.

2534
02:48:08,172 --> 02:48:09,548
Don't go. Don't go.

2535
02:48:09,673 --> 02:48:11,300
Wait.

2536
02:48:14,553 --> 02:48:16,847
Let me get you a chair.
Here, sit down.

2537
02:48:28,067 --> 02:48:32,071
- What are you doing, Joe?
- I've never seen more fucking homeless people.

2538
02:48:32,196 --> 02:48:34,865
Hey, you.
Drink that. Don't spill it.

2539
02:48:36,575 --> 02:48:38,911
- So...
- Josette, stay in the car.

2540
02:48:39,036 --> 02:48:40,913
- Joe-Joe, watch your sister.
- What do you guys want?

2541
02:48:41,038 --> 02:48:42,498
- Cigarettes.
- Beers.

2542
02:48:42,581 --> 02:48:45,042
- Yeah, we're here for beer.
- Lots of beer.

2543
02:48:45,167 --> 02:48:46,960
We're already gonna
get some beer.

2544
02:48:47,086 --> 02:48:49,546
- We'll be right back, Joe.
- Where you going?

2545
02:48:49,630 --> 02:48:53,217
We're going to get Aunt Honey's
photographs. You watch Josette.

2546
02:48:55,427 --> 02:48:57,763
How much is that gonna cost?

2547
02:48:58,806 --> 02:49:02,267
- What was your last name?
- Keep your eye on her.

2548
02:49:00,724 --> 02:49:02,309
Don't let her get to the edge.

2549
02:49:02,393 --> 02:49:05,270
- No, Honey Bush.
- Keep your eye on your sister.

2550
02:49:05,396 --> 02:49:07,272
- Honey, Honey Bush.
- Hey.

2551
02:49:07,398 --> 02:49:11,568
Hey, Mr. Johnson, how's it going?
Thank you. Sorry.

2552
02:49:11,652 --> 02:49:14,780
- Is five dollars enough?
- Yeah. That's how much it is.

2553
02:49:14,905 --> 02:49:16,865
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2554
02:49:17,950 --> 02:49:19,827
Let me see.

2555
02:49:21,078 --> 02:49:22,955
Who are these?

2556
02:49:24,790 --> 02:49:26,500
She's dead.

2557
02:49:40,556 --> 02:49:44,309
- Ew, that is gross.
- She's dead.

2558
02:49:44,393 --> 02:49:45,978
Ew, Honey, he's coming. Go.

2559
02:49:46,103 --> 02:49:48,564
- Oh, my God.
- Careful.

2560
02:50:03,579 --> 02:50:06,457
Come on, get in. Are we gonna
do this picnic or what?

2561
02:50:07,833 --> 02:50:09,752
Do you have a pen?
"7 NZ"...

2562
02:50:09,835 --> 02:50:11,962
- He's going to that one.
- Come on.

2563
02:50:12,087 --> 02:50:14,089
Remember this.
"7 NZ699."

2564
02:50:14,173 --> 02:50:16,091
7 NZ699.

2565
02:50:16,175 --> 02:50:20,471
6048364. 6048364.

2566
02:50:25,851 --> 02:50:27,770
Mmm.

2567
02:50:27,853 --> 02:50:30,147
See, look what you do.

2568
02:50:30,272 --> 02:50:33,025
You make the food look...

2569
02:50:33,108 --> 02:50:35,569
like a little show
down there on the plate.

2570
02:50:35,652 --> 02:50:40,532
It looks like a little stage with little...
little sausage people on it.

2571
02:50:40,616 --> 02:50:41,867
It's so cute.

2572
02:50:42,951 --> 02:50:44,995
I love all those things
about you.

2573
02:50:45,120 --> 02:50:47,247
I love everything you say.

2574
02:50:49,541 --> 02:50:52,878
I'm getting us out of Downey, baby.
Don't worry about it.

2575
02:50:52,961 --> 02:50:54,671
It's all temporary.

2576
02:50:56,465 --> 02:50:58,425
Oh, I don't want it to be over.

2577
02:50:58,509 --> 02:51:00,677
- We'll do it again.
- When?

2578
02:51:00,803 --> 02:51:04,765
Well, I've got three round trips
out of J.F.K. To Berlin.

2579
02:51:04,890 --> 02:51:09,645
And then a little stopover in Bangkok
that I requested, a four-day layover there.

2580
02:51:09,728 --> 02:51:13,982
That'll be great.
So, uh... next month.

2581
02:51:14,108 --> 02:51:18,362
- Maybe we should go to Hawaii.
- Yeah.

2582
02:51:18,445 --> 02:51:21,699
Chad could stay with his father.
I mean, he'll be in school, right?

2583
02:51:21,824 --> 02:51:25,494
- Chad had a great time.
- Wally had a great time.

2584
02:51:25,577 --> 02:51:28,330
How about little Wally?

2585
02:51:28,414 --> 02:51:30,332
A smokin' good time.

2586
02:51:32,543 --> 02:51:34,044
Yippee-aye-ay!

2587
02:51:36,922 --> 02:51:40,217
- Are we there?
- We're here. Finally.

2588
02:51:41,301 --> 02:51:43,262
Whoo!

2589
02:51:54,106 --> 02:51:56,942
Get out. We're here, babe.

2590
02:51:57,067 --> 02:51:59,069
It's not stupid.
It's gonna be fun.

2591
02:52:00,195 --> 02:52:01,155
Out.

2592
02:52:03,699 --> 02:52:06,076
Hey, you didn't have
to do that.

2593
02:52:07,119 --> 02:52:09,913
- Let's go get in the dirt.
- It's my pleasure.

2594
02:52:09,997 --> 02:52:13,625
Josette, watch out
for the dog shit.

2595
02:52:13,709 --> 02:52:14,877
Stay away from the dog poop.

2596
02:52:14,960 --> 02:52:17,129
<i>Gettin' out of Downey</i>

2597
02:52:17,254 --> 02:52:21,884
<i>- Take me out of Downey
- I'm gonna get you out of Downey</i>

2598
02:52:21,967 --> 02:52:24,178
<i>Take me out of Downey</i>

2599
02:52:25,721 --> 02:52:28,015
<i>I'm gonna get you
out of Downey</i>

2600
02:52:28,140 --> 02:52:31,435
<i>- Wait. Show me how you do it.
- Gettin' out of Downey</i>

2601
02:52:31,518 --> 02:52:34,563
<i>I'm gonna get you
out of Downey</i>

2602
02:52:37,941 --> 02:52:39,985
- Come on.
- Josette!

2603
02:52:40,110 --> 02:52:43,280
<i>- Come on, we're like two innings in, and you're winning.
- Oh, big girlie.</i>

2604
02:52:45,991 --> 02:52:48,285
You're such a wild thing.

2605
02:52:48,369 --> 02:52:50,079
Such a wild girl.

2606
02:52:52,164 --> 02:52:56,085
- Why do you even want to go down this hill?
- Mountain bikes, Nancy.

2607
02:52:56,168 --> 02:52:58,420
When you slide, just keep
your feet to the side.

2608
02:52:59,838 --> 02:53:03,592
For God's sakes. Jesus.

2609
02:53:06,512 --> 02:53:08,639
- You okay?
- Fine.

2610
02:53:08,722 --> 02:53:10,641
- There's something in my eye.
- Hi.

2611
02:53:10,724 --> 02:53:12,643
- How's the car?
- It's fine.

2612
02:53:12,726 --> 02:53:14,645
- You all right?
- Yeah.

2613
02:53:14,728 --> 02:53:18,190
- I agree.
- Hey, really funny.

2614
02:53:19,692 --> 02:53:22,069
- All right.
- You have a nice afternoon.

2615
02:53:24,613 --> 02:53:26,156
- Joe!
- Joe, come on.

2616
02:53:26,198 --> 02:53:28,325
Leave those girls alone.

2617
02:53:28,409 --> 02:53:31,120
Just like his dad.
Totally out of control.

2618
02:53:32,329 --> 02:53:35,207
How'd you like a little of that
stickin' on your drop chute?

2619
02:53:35,332 --> 02:53:37,501
Ten bucks says they're
waiting for us.

2620
02:53:38,919 --> 02:53:41,714
- Let's go.
- All right.

2621
02:53:41,839 --> 02:53:43,841
All right.

2622
02:53:46,051 --> 02:53:48,345
Honey. Honey.

2623
02:53:48,470 --> 02:53:50,347
- Okay.
- Okay? Be back in five.

2624
02:53:50,472 --> 02:53:52,349
- Could you hand me a beer?
- Yeah.

2625
02:53:54,226 --> 02:53:57,521
- Where are you going?
- What? We're gonna go, uh...

2626
02:53:57,646 --> 02:53:59,773
Discretion around
the little ones.

2627
02:53:59,898 --> 02:54:02,901
- When are we gonna eat?
- I can't hear you.
- I said move.

2628
02:54:03,027 --> 02:54:04,486
- Here, sweetie.
- Thanks.

2629
02:54:04,570 --> 02:54:06,780
We're gonna eat now?
What do you wanna eat?

2630
02:54:06,905 --> 02:54:09,867
Ow! Don't hit me.
Very good.

2631
02:54:09,950 --> 02:54:12,202
- Come on, Josette. You wanna eat?
- What do you want?

2632
02:54:12,286 --> 02:54:14,955
We have baloney.
We have Swiss cheese.

2633
02:54:15,080 --> 02:54:18,667
We have peanut butter
and jelly. We have ham.

2634
02:54:19,835 --> 02:54:21,712
- What?
- What do you want, baloney?

2635
02:54:21,837 --> 02:54:23,839
- Baloney sandwich?
- Okay.

2636
02:54:30,054 --> 02:54:32,848
Here, eat these. You need to
eat something to keep going.

2637
02:54:32,931 --> 02:54:35,934
Eating's a good thing
at a time like this.

2638
02:54:36,060 --> 02:54:38,604
- Thank you.
- I hope you like my muffins.

2639
02:54:40,230 --> 02:54:43,942
- Mr. Bitkower.
- Yes, Mrs. Finnigan, what can I get you?

2640
02:54:44,026 --> 02:54:46,028
I'd like to see the cake.

2641
02:54:55,287 --> 02:54:57,206
You can't.

2642
02:54:59,375 --> 02:55:01,835
I threw it away.

2643
02:55:06,590 --> 02:55:10,719
- Here we are.
- Here we are. Let's go, Chad.

2644
02:55:14,473 --> 02:55:16,392
Don't forget these, bud.

2645
02:55:17,935 --> 02:55:19,895
Okay.

2646
02:55:27,444 --> 02:55:30,114
- Thanks.
- See you.

2647
02:55:30,197 --> 02:55:32,783
- Bye, Gene.
- Wally, Wally. Bye, Wally.

2648
02:55:32,908 --> 02:55:34,785
- Bye, Wally.
- See you.

2649
02:55:42,835 --> 02:55:45,421
- Oh, home, sweet home.
- Really.

2650
02:55:48,173 --> 02:55:50,718
<i>Now to seal it off.</i>

2651
02:55:51,844 --> 02:55:55,764
<i>First order of business,
put all this oil back where it came from.</i>

2652
02:56:03,022 --> 02:56:06,316
Aubrey Bell?
Mommy, who's Aubrey Bell?

2653
02:56:10,779 --> 02:56:14,158
<i>Captain Planet's doing it!
He's sucking the oil back!</i>

2654
02:56:14,241 --> 02:56:16,201
<i>Go, Planet!</i>

2655
02:56:21,373 --> 02:56:24,043
<i>The fourth of July</i>

2656
02:56:24,168 --> 02:56:27,046
<i>Before the fourth of July</i>

2657
02:56:27,171 --> 02:56:29,965
<i>Fourth of July</i>

2658
02:56:30,049 --> 02:56:31,508
Come on.

2659
02:56:34,053 --> 02:56:35,971
- They're on bikes, Bill.
- Come on, come on.

2660
02:56:36,055 --> 02:56:38,849
- They gotta cut through here.
- Let's go in here.

2661
02:56:38,974 --> 02:56:43,062
I don't wanna run all over these mountains
for a couple of cockteasers.

2662
02:56:44,438 --> 02:56:47,316
Oh, I don't think
this goes all the way.

2663
02:56:48,567 --> 02:56:51,362
Looks like we're stopping here.

2664
02:56:52,112 --> 02:56:53,447
Those guys are following us.

2665
02:56:53,530 --> 02:56:57,117
Okay, let me... I'll warm them up.
And then you just come in.

2666
02:56:57,242 --> 02:56:59,161
I'll get one of them
to go there, man.

2667
02:57:01,330 --> 02:57:04,500
Hey. How are you?

2668
02:57:04,625 --> 02:57:06,418
Okay.

2669
02:57:06,960 --> 02:57:09,004
Wait, I-I... I know you.

2670
02:57:09,088 --> 02:57:12,966
From, uh... No, I'm sure I do.
From that photo shoot.

2671
02:57:13,092 --> 02:57:15,052
- When I did your makeup.
- I don't know what you're talking about.

2672
02:57:15,135 --> 02:57:17,054
The maquillage for the photo shoot.
I'm a makeup artist.

2673
02:57:17,137 --> 02:57:19,139
I thought that you were
someone I'd done for a shoot.

2674
02:57:19,264 --> 02:57:21,350
- That funny?
- Sorry.

2675
02:57:21,433 --> 02:57:23,352
Are you guys
actresses or models?

2676
02:57:23,435 --> 02:57:25,813
We're not either. I'm...
We're not either one.

2677
02:57:25,896 --> 02:57:28,941
You're not? I just mean, just 'cause
you have the looks for it. You could be.

2678
02:57:29,066 --> 02:57:31,694
If, you know,
if you wanted to.

2679
02:57:31,777 --> 02:57:36,740
Well, if it happened, that would be okay.
If it doesn't, that's okay too.

2680
02:57:36,824 --> 02:57:40,160
But, hey, I mean, sometimes
I do some talent scout stuff too and...

2681
02:57:40,285 --> 02:57:43,414
I mean, if you ever want to.
I'm Bill. This is Jerry.

2682
02:57:43,497 --> 02:57:45,582
You want a beer?

2683
02:57:45,708 --> 02:57:47,960
No, thanks. You want...

2684
02:57:48,544 --> 02:57:52,631
- No, that's okay.
- So, have you done any movie stars?

2685
02:57:52,715 --> 02:57:54,508
Uh, yeah... Yes, ma'am.

2686
02:57:54,591 --> 02:57:56,844
Really? Who was the biggest
movie star you've done?

2687
02:57:56,969 --> 02:58:01,724
What was that last one I did?
What was that big one I did last time?

2688
02:58:03,142 --> 02:58:05,728
I think it was Roseanne Barr.

2689
02:58:05,811 --> 02:58:07,521
- She's big.
- She's huge.

2690
02:58:07,604 --> 02:58:11,233
- You're lying. I can tell you're lying.
- Yeah, that didn't work.

2691
02:58:11,316 --> 02:58:15,320
- What's your name?
- I'm Barbara. That's Nancy.

2692
02:58:15,404 --> 02:58:16,780
Hi.

2693
02:58:17,865 --> 02:58:21,785
- So, you married?
- No.

2694
02:58:21,869 --> 02:58:23,537
Uh, we were.

2695
02:58:24,997 --> 02:58:26,665
Very unfortunate,
what happened.

2696
02:58:26,790 --> 02:58:29,918
Uh, I'll have
one of those beers.

2697
02:58:30,002 --> 02:58:32,796
Hey, you know what's a hundred
yards away? You know the Bat Caves?

2698
02:58:32,921 --> 02:58:34,715
You ever watch Batman?
Remember the series Batman?

2699
02:58:34,798 --> 02:58:37,051
- Yeah.
- Well, the Bat Caves where they shot it...

2700
02:58:37,134 --> 02:58:38,802
Let me show you this cave.
Here's your beer.

2701
02:58:38,886 --> 02:58:40,721
Let me take Barbara away
from you for one second.

2702
02:58:40,804 --> 02:58:42,598
Come here. It'll just take a second.
Don't worry about it.

2703
02:58:42,681 --> 02:58:44,850
- Okay, I'll just have one beer.
- All right, one.

2704
02:58:44,975 --> 02:58:47,269
Come here.
Don't worry about it.

2705
02:58:47,352 --> 02:58:49,229
- Where you guys live?
- Malibu.
- Come back.

2706
02:58:49,354 --> 02:58:50,981
- That's on the beach, right?
- Yep, it's on the beach.

2707
02:58:51,065 --> 02:58:54,485
Can I have a beer? Thanks.

2708
02:58:54,610 --> 02:58:58,030
Oh, Jesus. Excuse me.

2709
02:58:58,155 --> 02:59:00,783
No, it's one of the streets
that goes up.

2710
02:59:00,866 --> 02:59:02,534
- Oh.
- Come here. It's right down here.

2711
02:59:02,618 --> 02:59:04,953
<i>- Do you mind?
- We had a place up there for a while.</i>

2712
02:59:05,037 --> 02:59:07,164
<i>Now, after we split up
with our wives, you know...</i>

2713
02:59:07,247 --> 02:59:09,750
<i>- Oh, you lived with your wives?
- Well, yeah.</i>

2714
02:59:09,833 --> 02:59:12,461
<i>So now we got this place.</i>

2715
02:59:12,544 --> 02:59:15,005
We got this fish tank thing,
like a fish tank.

2716
02:59:15,089 --> 02:59:17,383
<i>Hey, stop that!
Don't... Leave me...</i>

2717
02:59:17,508 --> 02:59:20,302
<i>- What are you doing? Leave me alone!
- What the fuck is he doing? Jerry!</i>

2718
02:59:21,762 --> 02:59:23,013
Jerry!

2719
02:59:24,556 --> 02:59:25,224
Jerry!

2720
02:59:31,855 --> 02:59:33,440
- Fuck!
- Whoa!

2721
02:59:33,524 --> 02:59:36,527
Earthquake.
Earthquake, you fucking nut!

2722
02:59:46,161 --> 02:59:49,081
All right, Josette. Come here.

2723
02:59:52,751 --> 02:59:54,503
Jerry!

2724
02:59:55,504 --> 02:59:58,006
Okay, look. Look here.

2725
03:00:00,300 --> 03:00:03,095
What's happening, Howard?
Howard?

2726
03:00:03,220 --> 03:00:05,723
We have to get under a table.

2727
03:00:06,932 --> 03:00:10,144
Gene, earthquake!
Get under the doorway!

2728
03:00:10,269 --> 03:00:12,896
- Quick!
- Underneath the door!

2729
03:00:13,772 --> 03:00:16,942
This is Officer Gene Shepard of
the Los Angeles Police Department.

2730
03:00:17,026 --> 03:00:19,361
We are currently
experiencing an earthquake.

2731
03:00:19,445 --> 03:00:22,740
<i>On Broadway I danced</i>

2732
03:00:22,865 --> 03:00:24,992
<i>For that senator</i>

2733
03:00:26,493 --> 03:00:28,662
<i>They know me in London</i>

2734
03:00:28,746 --> 03:00:31,582
<i>They know me in Paris</i>

2735
03:00:31,665 --> 03:00:33,292
Ralph!

2736
03:00:34,251 --> 03:00:36,712
Jesus. This is bigger
than the one in '71.

2737
03:00:36,795 --> 03:00:39,465
Don't worry. Don't worry.
It's not the big one.

2738
03:00:39,590 --> 03:00:42,885
Earthquake!
Mommy, get over here, quick!

2739
03:00:42,968 --> 03:00:47,598
Just lay down, Mommy.
Just lay down.

2740
03:00:47,681 --> 03:00:49,600
Whoa! I lost my umbrella.

2741
03:00:52,644 --> 03:00:54,938
Here we go, baby.

2742
03:00:55,022 --> 03:00:56,940
In the doorway.

2743
03:00:57,024 --> 03:01:00,736
If you are close in proximity to any
power lines, please move quickly away.

2744
03:01:00,819 --> 03:01:05,407
Falling power lines can result in
electrocution. There is a possibility of...

2745
03:01:05,491 --> 03:01:08,077
This is it, baby.
We're going out together.

2746
03:01:09,953 --> 03:01:12,081
This is the big one, baby.

2747
03:01:16,835 --> 03:01:19,630
- It wasn't the big one.
- No.

2748
03:01:28,180 --> 03:01:31,058
You're such a big, brave boy.

2749
03:01:31,141 --> 03:01:34,269
- Where the fuck are they? Jerry!
- Jesus Christ.

2750
03:01:40,192 --> 03:01:42,861
All right. It's okay.

2751
03:01:52,538 --> 03:01:55,332
Well, we should probably eat,
is what we should do.

2752
03:01:55,457 --> 03:01:57,376
Yeah, what happened to that
big meal we were supposed to have?

2753
03:01:57,459 --> 03:01:59,294
We should probably have a
whole bunch of eggs or something.

2754
03:01:59,378 --> 03:02:02,423
We should turn on the TV
and see what the damage is.

2755
03:02:20,524 --> 03:02:22,317
<i>We're beginning to
receive reports now...</i>

2756
03:02:22,401 --> 03:02:24,403
<i>on that 7.4 magnitude earthquake...
- Dunphy's on.</i>

2757
03:02:24,528 --> 03:02:26,405
<i>we experienced earlier this morning.
- Dunphy will tell us the truth.</i>

2758
03:02:26,530 --> 03:02:30,159
<i>- Around Joshua Tree, huh?
- A house on fire in Baldwin Hills.</i>

2759
03:02:29,992 --> 03:02:33,579
- Seven-point-four. That's big.
- Well, that's pretty big.

2760
03:02:33,662 --> 03:02:36,665
You know, that's really
not that bad. Eight is bad.

2761
03:02:36,749 --> 03:02:38,000
That's not as bad as an eight.

2762
03:02:38,042 --> 03:02:40,794
- Obviously it's not as bad as an eight.
- Well, no. But I mean...

2763
03:02:40,878 --> 03:02:43,047
When you come from California,
you don't worry about that stuff.

2764
03:02:43,172 --> 03:02:46,300
<i>At least 15 people have been injured
and we're told one person died.</i>

2765
03:02:46,383 --> 03:02:49,845
- One person killed.
- One fatality, yeah.

2766
03:02:49,970 --> 03:02:51,597
You know, that's really
not bad, one person.

2767
03:02:51,722 --> 03:02:53,807
Wait, here he's talking to...
Look at this.

2768
03:02:53,891 --> 03:02:56,727
<i>- Stormy was in the air when the quake happened.
- Here's a helicopter pilot.</i>

2769
03:02:56,810 --> 03:02:58,729
<i>Tell us exactly what you saw.</i>

2770
03:02:58,854 --> 03:03:01,231
You think that's his real name,
Stormy Weathers?

2771
03:03:01,315 --> 03:03:03,776
<i>- God, I hope not.
- It all looked pretty normal to me.</i>

2772
03:03:03,859 --> 03:03:04,693
Where'd they get this guy?

2773
03:03:04,777 --> 03:03:07,946
- Ralph, you have any bourbon?
- What about some tequila?

2774
03:03:08,072 --> 03:03:10,866
<i>- Yeah, I'd have a tequila.
- As I was landing I was remarking to myself...</i>

2775
03:03:10,949 --> 03:03:13,827
<i>- That stuff gives you a headache, Claire.
- What a beautiful sight L.A. is.</i>

2776
03:03:13,911 --> 03:03:17,539
- Where's those lemons I brought home?
- I don't know. Maybe by the bar.

2777
03:03:17,623 --> 03:03:20,584
<i>Every Angeleno says
to himself or herself...</i>

2778
03:03:20,667 --> 03:03:24,088
<i>just how lucky he or she is
to be living in L.A.</i>

2779
03:03:24,171 --> 03:03:26,965
- I'll have some too.
- I hope nothing happened to your house.

2780
03:03:27,091 --> 03:03:29,385
<i>Now here is the latest news
on the earthquake.</i>

2781
03:03:29,468 --> 03:03:32,179
<i>There is one fatality.
This has been confirmed now.</i>

2782
03:03:32,262 --> 03:03:36,558
<i>A young woman in Griffith Park was killed
by falling rocks, apparently while hiking.</i>

2783
03:03:36,642 --> 03:03:40,104
<i>- We're not sure if the death was earthquake-related.
- Here's to lemonade.</i>

2784
03:03:40,229 --> 03:03:43,482
<i>We're told that 60 people
have been treated at area hospitals.</i>

2785
03:03:47,861 --> 03:03:50,656
<i>If you're looking for a rainbow</i>

2786
03:03:51,824 --> 03:03:54,451
<i>You know there's
gonna be some rain</i>

2787
03:03:55,494 --> 03:03:58,414
<i>One minute you're
filled with happiness</i>

2788
03:03:59,331 --> 03:04:02,167
<i>And the next minute
there's nothing but pain</i>

2789
03:04:02,292 --> 03:04:05,838
<i>If you're a prisoner
- Let's have another one.</i>

2790
03:04:05,963 --> 03:04:09,633
<i>And I'm a prisoner
- And then back in the tub!</i>

2791
03:04:09,758 --> 03:04:12,720
<i>I'm a prisoner of life</i>

2792
03:04:15,347 --> 03:04:18,434
<i>One day your man is here</i>

2793
03:04:18,517 --> 03:04:21,895
<i>And the next day
he's walked out and gone</i>

2794
03:04:23,313 --> 03:04:25,899
<i>But no matter what happens</i>

2795
03:04:25,983 --> 03:04:29,611
<i>You gotta somehow carry on</i>

2796
03:04:29,737 --> 03:04:31,655
<i>When you're a prisoner</i>

2797
03:04:33,157 --> 03:04:35,784
<i>And I'm a prisoner</i>

2798
03:04:37,077 --> 03:04:39,371
<i>I'm a prisoner of life</i>

2799
03:04:42,750 --> 03:04:44,668
<i>Life's good</i>

2800
03:04:44,752 --> 03:04:46,795
<i>It's bad</i>

2801
03:04:46,920 --> 03:04:49,423
<i>It's in between</i>

2802
03:04:49,506 --> 03:04:54,970
<i>But it's the unexpected
and the uncertainty that keeps us going</i>

2803
03:04:55,095 --> 03:04:57,514
<i>You know what I mean</i>

2804
03:04:57,598 --> 03:05:01,518
<i>Oh, one day you own the world</i>

2805
03:05:01,602 --> 03:05:04,855
<i>And the next day
the world owns you</i>

2806
03:05:06,023 --> 03:05:09,151
<i>One day everything's a lie</i>

2807
03:05:09,276 --> 03:05:12,571
<i>And the next day
you swear it's all true</i>

2808
03:05:12,696 --> 03:05:15,157
<i>When you're a prisoner</i>

2809
03:05:16,200 --> 03:05:19,661
<i>And I'm a prisoner</i>

2810
03:05:19,745 --> 03:05:21,663
<i>I'm a prisoner of</i>

2811
03:05:29,922 --> 03:05:32,549
<i>Woke up this morning</i>

2812
03:05:32,674 --> 03:05:34,551
<i>Wanted to cry</i>

2813
03:05:35,594 --> 03:05:38,180
<i>Then I remembered</i>

2814
03:05:38,305 --> 03:05:41,475
<i>Yes, I knew why</i>

2815
03:05:41,558 --> 03:05:44,144
<i>He's a real good one
for havin' his cake</i>

2816
03:05:44,228 --> 03:05:47,064
<i>I'm gonna go fishing
or jump in the lake</i>

2817
03:05:49,400 --> 03:05:51,902
<i>I'm gonna go fishing</i>

2818
03:05:52,027 --> 03:05:54,029
<i>That's what I'll do</i>

2819
03:05:55,072 --> 03:05:57,741
<i>Think about nothing</i>

2820
03:05:57,825 --> 03:05:59,868
<i>Not even you</i>

2821
03:06:00,953 --> 03:06:03,414
<i>Catch me a big one
a big speckled trout</i>

2822
03:06:03,497 --> 03:06:06,250
<i>Snap him in the water
I'll pull him on out</i>

2823
03:06:08,627 --> 03:06:11,422
<i>Sweet-talkin' liar</i>

2824
03:06:11,547 --> 03:06:14,466
<i>Spin me a yarn</i>

2825
03:06:14,591 --> 03:06:17,219
<i>Tell me a story</i>

2826
03:06:17,302 --> 03:06:19,430
<i>Big as a barn</i>

2827
03:06:20,472 --> 03:06:23,100
<i>You wanna stop and listen
I won't hear you out</i>

2828
03:06:23,225 --> 03:06:25,936
<i>I'm gonna go fishing
and catch me a trout</i>

2829
03:06:28,105 --> 03:06:30,816
<i>A man is a liar</i>

2830
03:06:30,941 --> 03:06:33,110
<i>A man is a fool</i>

2831
03:06:34,153 --> 03:06:36,613
<i>Playing for keepers</i>

2832
03:06:36,739 --> 03:06:38,949
<i>And breaking the rules</i>

2833
03:06:40,034 --> 03:06:42,494
<i>He'll be the loser
You'll see, you'll find out</i>

2834
03:06:42,619 --> 03:06:46,123
<i>I'm gonna go fishing
and catch me a trout</i>

2835
03:06:46,248 --> 03:06:48,876
<i>Down in the water</i>

2836
03:06:49,001 --> 03:06:51,003
<i>Look at him shine</i>

2837
03:06:52,046 --> 03:06:54,673
<i>There goes a big one</i>

2838
03:06:54,798 --> 03:06:56,759
<i>That one is mine</i>

2839
03:06:57,801 --> 03:07:00,429
<i>Catches are real now
I've got the feel now</i>

2840
03:07:00,512 --> 03:07:03,348
<i>I'll snap with a fine fly rod
I'll catch me a trout</i>

2841
03:07:05,601 --> 03:07:08,395
<i>Sweet-talking liar</i>

2842
03:07:08,479 --> 03:07:11,315
<i>You're in for a fall</i>

2843
03:07:11,398 --> 03:07:13,984
<i>You tell me a story</i>

2844
03:07:14,109 --> 03:07:16,362
<i>You talk to the wall</i>

2845
03:07:17,404 --> 03:07:19,865
<i>Gonna go my way
on down the highway</i>

2846
03:07:19,990 --> 03:07:22,743
<i>I'm gonna go fishin'
and catch me a trout</i>

2847
03:07:24,536 --> 03:07:26,497
<i>Catch me a trout</i>

2848
03:07:27,498 --> 03:07:29,416
<i>Catch me a trout</i>

2849
03:07:30,459 --> 03:07:32,336
<i>Catch me a trout</i>

2850
03:07:34,463 --> 03:07:37,424
<i>On drums, Bobby Previte.</i>

2851
03:07:37,508 --> 03:07:41,387
<i>On bass, Greg Cohen.</i>

2852
03:07:41,512 --> 03:07:44,556
<i>And on piano, Terry Adams.</i>

2853
03:07:45,974 --> 03:07:49,436
<i>On the vibes, Gene Estes.</i>

2854
03:07:49,520 --> 03:07:53,691
<i>And on trombone, Bruce Fowler.</i>

2855
03:07:53,774 --> 03:07:58,028
<i>That's it. Good night! Yeah!</i>

2856
03:08:07,496 --> 03:08:07,538
THE END
