1
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
2 pounds. And fat ones.

2
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:47,600
That's shoulder, right?

3
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:51,300
The Kube Brother's 
usual. Tell me about it!

4
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:53,900
How much?

5
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:55,700
2 measures.

6
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,900
Well, Mr Interligator... 
How's your wife doing?

7
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,800
Poorly.

8
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,600
Roger, your muffler.

9
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,700
I've got it.

10
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:17,900
She tried to 
take her life again?

11
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,500
Thank heaven, she's alive.

12
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,900
Butcher...,

13
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:31,900
I think you've 
got a customer coming.

14
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:33,300
Who's next?

15
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:34,400
I am!

16
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:43,500
That for me?

17
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:44,800
At your service.

18
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:46,800
Put it on my bill.

19
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:47,800
We know where...

20
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:49,200
she keeps her bill alright!

21
00:05:52,100 --> 00:05:53,000
Your turn!

22
00:05:57,500 --> 00:06:00,700
Carburator's acting up again.

23
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:12,800
That'll cost you... 
the ride, plus luggage...

24
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,100
How're you paying?

25
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,400
Lentils?

26
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,800
That's all I've got.

27
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,800
Listen. Those shoes 
there would do the trick...

28
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:35,900
Closed.

29
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:36,800
That's all today.

30
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,200
I didn't come for that.

31
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,600
Anyway, I don't eat meat. 
I came about the ad.

32
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,800
What ad?

33
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:44,900
In the paper.

34
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:46,600
What paper?

35
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:48,300
"Hard Times".

36
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:57,600
"Light building 
maintenance. Odd jobs..."

37
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,500
"Room and board. 
Southern exposure."

38
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:04,300
It's the right place, number 129a?

39
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,100
Here or there, 
this is nowhere.

40
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:08,700
There's no neighbor hassle!

41
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:14,800
And no visitors.

42
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:20,000
Well... 
I must've made a mistake.

43
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:43,000
Not so fast! If I got you 
right, you're looking for a job?

44
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,700
Come here.

45
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:46,400
Turn around.

46
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,200
Pardon?

47
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,600
Turn around!

48
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:52,000
What do you weigh?

49
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:55,400
137... 140. Why?

50
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,800
You're no heavyweight! 
I've got work...

51
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,000
...but it takes muscle.

52
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,100
No problem!

53
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,600
I'm a butcher 
but I don't mince words.

54
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:08,700
You don't seem to 
be cut out for the job.

55
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,600
You don't have the bones, the chest...

56
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:17,300
I'll try you out, 
but you'll have to bust ass!

57
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:21,200
What a stroke of luck!

58
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:23,700
Thanks.

59
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,900
Come on.

60
00:08:25,300 --> 00:08:27,400
So what does the work involve?

61
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,500
"Light building 
maintenance. Odd jobs.."

62
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:34,300
"Room and board. 
Southern exposure."

63
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:35,900
Like in the ad?

64
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,800
How about that? 
Just like the ad!

65
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:46,300
Watch it, there's a step loose. 
You'll fix it with the rest...

66
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:49,700
Paint, electricity, cleaning...

67
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,100
The works!

68
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,200
You'll like it here.

69
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:02,800
And there're no neighbors opposite.

70
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:05,600
Hang the key there.

71
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll let you get settled.

72
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:13,900
Thanks.

73
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,300
How're things in town?

74
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,700
Terrible.

75
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:46,400
With rationing, people'd 
eat their shoes. It's touchy.

76
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,300
They have no smarts.

77
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:51,500
It's a mess. 
And till things grow back...!

78
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,700
They'll never grow back.

79
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:56,500
You're no optimist.

80
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,900
Get that into your skull, 
for chrissake!

81
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,100
Your hair isn't growing back.

82
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:04,800
Same difference.

83
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:17,500
Can't we open 
the windows 5 minutes?

84
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:22,800
I like the smell of glue.

85
00:11:23,300 --> 00:11:26,600
It smells like fish. 
It brings back memories.

86
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,400
What do you think of the new guy?

87
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
You deaf?

88
00:11:43,100 --> 00:11:44,500
He's skinny.

89
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:51,500
Thinking about her again?

90
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:55,500
They say she hears voices now.

91
00:12:20,100 --> 00:12:22,200
Is it too much effort 
to put that closer?

92
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,300
Hi!

93
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,200
Forget it, she's deaf as a post.

94
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:51,200
If she gets lost, we'll find her.

95
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,800
Go back home, 
there's nothing left.

96
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:57,100
I'm telling you 
there's nothing left!

97
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:02,400
You finished?

98
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:05,300
Don't stay up there. 
Fix the 3rd floor bulb.

99
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:15,000
-Hi Butcher!
-Hi, Postman!

100
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,000
Got a parcel for you daughter.

101
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,300
Upstairs.

102
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,200
Watch the step.

103
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,300
Mind your business!

104
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:38,300
Go for it, Marcel!

105
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:39,600
Grab it!

106
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,700
I've got it!

107
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:44,800
Throw it here!

108
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:49,300
You bastard!

109
00:18:00,200 --> 00:18:01,900
Postal Administration!

110
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:03,300
Article 12:

111
00:18:03,700 --> 00:18:07,300
"You have 20 sec to scatter 
and return to your domiciles."

112
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:08,500
Now!

113
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:11,100
You have no kids to feed.

114
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:17,900
That means kids too!

115
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:32,200
Can't you read? idiot!

116
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:34,200
"Julie Clapet"

117
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,100
He's a friend.

118
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,700
A friend?

119
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,000
Here, Julie...

120
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,500
Sign here, Julie.

121
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:50,400
I call you Julie because
I like you. But I won't rush you.

122
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:56,500
See you soon, Julie.

123
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,700
Here... for the ad.

124
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,200
At your service.

125
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,600
That new guy looks weird!

126
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,800
An ex-circus man!

127
00:19:12,100 --> 00:19:13,000
From the circus?

128
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:22,300
It must be nibbles.
That's why they...

129
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,600
Would you care to taste them?

130
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,100
Yes! I'd love to.

131
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,900
Then 7pm at my place,
time to prepare.

132
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:45,700
-Say, he after her?
-After who?

133
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:50,100
Your girl. She's sure a cute 
young lady. She needs someone...

134
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,200
She's got me! Got that!

135
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:53,800
By the way, I've got news.

136
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:58,200
They shot one down 2 days ago.
A superb 30 yard moving target.

137
00:19:58,500 --> 00:19:59,300
No body?

138
00:19:59,600 --> 00:20:00,600
They cart their dead away.

139
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:04,300
Vermin! They say 
they even eat money.

140
00:20:04,700 --> 00:20:08,200
Got to get rid 
of them for good, see?

141
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:11,800
Those seed eating faggots... 
They'll get it, alright!

142
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:16,800
Bye Butcher!

143
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,200
Bye Postman!

144
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Think it's for tonight?

145
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:29,300
I hope so.

146
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,800
Goddamn Butcher! 
I know he won't do it tonight.

147
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:38,500
He dawdles just to piss me off!

148
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,500
It works.

149
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,900
What is he waiting for?

150
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:45,900
For the new guy to 
escape in a garbage can too?

151
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:49,900
How long did he last us?

152
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,100
A week.

153
00:20:57,300 --> 00:20:59,200
Not counting the bouillon

154
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:15,600
A week! We finished 
the last chunk 2 days ago.

155
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,700
I'm hungry.

156
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,300
I have a pit inside!

157
00:22:24,900 --> 00:22:28,300
My dear Hercules... 
Every man for himself...

158
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:13,300
It's me.

159
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,700
Hi.

160
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,200
Come in.

161
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:21,600
Please, come in.

162
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,600
This is for you.

163
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,900
Thanks

164
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,200
Sit down.

165
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,900
Did you paint this?

166
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,800
Yes... its nothing much.

167
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,100
I made tea.

168
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,300
Shall I pour it?

169
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:59,000
yes, please.

170
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:06,300
I hope you don't 
find me too forward.

171
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:09,500
Not at all. Why should I?

172
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:13,800
A girl invites you to her 
home... a bit improper, maybe?

173
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,400
Well, actually...

174
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,100
I wanted to thank you 
for this morning.

175
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,000
Thank me for what?

176
00:25:23,300 --> 00:25:25,400
You rescued my package in the stairs.

177
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:28,700
I was moved by your gesture.

178
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,600
It's only natural.

179
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:38,300
But usually, 
people only think of themselves...

180
00:25:39,500 --> 00:25:41,300
...these days.

181
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:53,500
It's normal,...

182
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,600
they have nothing.

183
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:56,900
Deep down, they're good people.

184
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:00,300
I'm glad they like me.

185
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:01,900
They're very kind.

186
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,900
Things're fine with your dad too.

187
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:09,100
I believe he thinks 
I'm a nice guy.

188
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,700
"Why not try gourmet cheese spread?"

189
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:13,900
"That's new!"

190
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:14,800
"And it's handy."

191
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,700
They talk to me about you.

192
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,100
Who?

193
00:26:19,600 --> 00:26:21,200
The voices in my head.

194
00:26:22,500 --> 00:26:25,900
Of course, the voices! 
What do they say?

195
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:31,800
Let me think...

196
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,500
They talk in such a way...

197
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,800
Do they talk about love?

198
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:53,100
Aurore, you're missing 
something hilarious!

199
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:57,500
Anyway, I have no choice. 
Here... Tomorrow, at 11 sharp.

200
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,300
Ring! Don't let me down.

201
00:27:05,700 --> 00:27:09,600
Move out? What for? 
I've just moved in!

202
00:27:10,500 --> 00:27:12,600
This place isn't that great.

203
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:16,700
Its insanitary, the walls 
are crumbling, it leaks...

204
00:27:18,400 --> 00:27:20,200
Maybe you don't like me?

205
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,900
You act as if you want me to leave...

206
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,200
On the contrary,...

207
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,200
That's not what I meant.

208
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,800
It does that...

209
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:31,800
sometimes.

210
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:44,400
Did I hurt you?

211
00:27:45,800 --> 00:27:47,100
I'm alright.

212
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,400
We really clashed.

213
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,500
I'm so clumsy.

214
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,800
Don't budge.

215
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:13,800
I'm blind as a mole.
Everything's foggy.

216
00:28:16,100 --> 00:28:17,900
I could get lost in it.

217
00:28:28,600 --> 00:28:31,200
Since I break things, 
I always buy two.

218
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,900
You play the cello.

219
00:28:43,900 --> 00:28:46,000
I play music too.

220
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,200
Wait, I'll be back.

221
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,400
Shit not again!

222
00:28:55,900 --> 00:28:57,000
What're you doing?

223
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:58,500
I wanted to take a bath.

224
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,500
Again?

225
00:28:59,900 --> 00:29:02,700
You sharpen your knives enough!

226
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,800
A musical saw!

227
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,400
It has nice sound.

228
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:13,400
Sit down.

229
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,200
I used to play it with the doctor.

230
00:29:20,500 --> 00:29:23,800
Livingstone...
"Dr Livingstone"!

231
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,600
He was my partner.

232
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,900
It'll rust now that he's gone.

233
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:30,200
Where did he go?

234
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,300
He disappeared after a show... 
We only found his carcass.

235
00:29:36,800 --> 00:29:38,000
They ate him.

236
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:42,000
Can you imagine, they ate him!

237
00:29:44,600 --> 00:29:47,800
That night, I lost everything. 
So, the 1st ad I read...

238
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,100
And here I am.

239
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,600
I must tell you something.

240
00:29:55,300 --> 00:29:56,600
Hush... listen!

241
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:10,600
Do you know that tune?

242
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:13,700
It was his favorite.

243
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,200
Notice how the nights are clear?

244
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:09,400
We're entering 
the Virgo age. That's my sign.

245
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:11,800
No joke?

246
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,200
I swear it!
Virgo, ascendant Leo.

247
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:20,400
Cut it out, not everyone's 
Gorilla, ascendant Bulldozer!

248
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:24,300
I'm in luck, there's lots in store.

249
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:25,300
"Get ready, the wind's shifting."

250
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,000
You'd like to pack up 
and leave, right?

251
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,500
You wouldn't get far.
It's worse out there, they draw straws.

252
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:36,500
It'd be ashamed to see those hams go.

253
00:31:37,700 --> 00:31:39,700
And those little sucklings...

254
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:42,500
Don't joke about that, I hate it.

255
00:31:46,800 --> 00:31:47,800
You're better off here.

256
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,700
At least, we got a system.

257
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:53,900
My ass! Those helpers 
you ice are drawing straws too.

258
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,600
That's fate!

259
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,200
And you can't help Fate.

260
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:09,200
Just like you said:

261
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,300
"The wind's shifting."

262
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:14,300
Everyone's gonna get it.

263
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:44,600
Mr Louison, 
I'm not supposed to tell you but...

264
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,400
...what happened to
your friend happens here.

265
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:53,100
It takes place at night in the stairs.

266
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,700
That's why no one goes out.

267
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,400
And my father...

268
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,800
SOPORIFIC HERBS

269
00:36:06,700 --> 00:36:07,700
Hi.

270
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,500
-I'm here for the springs. 
-Come in.

271
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:22,300
This is antique! 
It has seen a lot of use.

272
00:36:23,200 --> 00:36:24,500
What's the problem?

273
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:26,800
It squeaks. That's a pain.

274
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:32,900
Could you bounce just a little?

275
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,800
I can't see anything.

276
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:43,200
It does it most...

277
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,200
when there're 2 of us.

278
00:36:47,900 --> 00:36:48,900
Let's try it.

279
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,300
As I thought, 
the 2nd spring to the right.

280
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:01,900
"Come, Aurore..."

281
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:06,600
"Come..."

282
00:38:07,700 --> 00:38:11,100
"We are here..."

283
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:15,400
"...to help you..."

284
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,500
"Come..."

285
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,700
"Come..."

286
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,900
"Freed from life.."

287
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,200
"Come with us, Aurore."

288
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:32,800
"Soothed..."

289
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,600
COME AT 11 SHARP. RING HARD!

290
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,400
"Rotten world..."

291
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,500
That should do it.

292
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:53,200
Here.

293
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:54,500
Thanks.

294
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:57,800
What are Troglodists?

295
00:39:58,200 --> 00:40:01,200
Outlaws. It's the big story,
but no one sees them.

296
00:40:01,700 --> 00:40:03,800
Tales to keep people busy.

297
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:06,100
A typical Capricorn statement!

298
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:07,900
You lose, I'm Aquarius.

299
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,900
The sign of the future!

300
00:40:10,300 --> 00:40:11,400
The future...

301
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
It's soon history around here.

302
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,400
It's so easy to miss a step.

303
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,300
Don't worry about me.

304
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:21,800
You little brats, 
give that back!

305
00:40:22,400 --> 00:40:25,500
Quit sneering, 
or I'll whack you one!

306
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:27,800
I'll beat one with the other!

307
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,500
Give that back, 
I won't stand for it!

308
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:32,900
Nice work!

309
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,700
Little rugrats,...

310
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:36,100
How'll we get it down?

311
00:40:36,500 --> 00:40:38,900
This is a job for the Australian!

312
00:40:39,500 --> 00:40:40,300
The Australian?

313
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,000
Stand back.

314
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,600
That's some tool!

315
00:41:02,900 --> 00:41:05,800
The Australian is nothing
without its master.

316
00:41:07,100 --> 00:41:07,900
How about that!

317
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,400
So, Tapioca, you find a job?

318
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,400
No, not yet.

319
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,300
That's bad news,
your bill's running up.

320
00:41:16,700 --> 00:41:18,300
Not to mention the rent.

321
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:22,000
I'm in a bit of a fix.
But I've got some good stuff.

322
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:23,300
Have a look?

323
00:41:23,700 --> 00:41:26,500
Black market? You're a louse!

324
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:28,500
But take a look.

325
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:29,700
What's that?

326
00:41:31,100 --> 00:41:34,400
A rat-call. That's the
female cry. It attracts males.

327
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,900
But there're no 
rats left. And what?

328
00:41:37,700 --> 00:41:41,000
That is a bullshit detector.

329
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,000
Try it.

330
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,300
Try what?

331
00:41:45,700 --> 00:41:47,900
Give me some bullshit.

332
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:49,400
Come on!

333
00:41:49,800 --> 00:41:51,000
I can't do it on cue.

334
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,800
"Life is beautiful."

335
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:58,100
A bullshit of a
detector! Turn it off!

336
00:41:58,600 --> 00:41:59,500
We can't hear anything.

337
00:41:59,800 --> 00:42:02,500
If you can't pay up,
we'll have to find a way.

338
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:05,600
Fast. Otherwise,...
you'll wind up hooked to me.

339
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:07,100
Very funny!

340
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:11,000
What about that clown?
He's been around long enough.

341
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:12,500
We're edgy

342
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,100
Don't care!
He'll redo the ceilings.

343
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:18,700
Meanwhile, he takes
root and we wither away.

344
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:21,100
I have mouths to feed.

345
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:24,000
I bet! The granny's, for instance.

346
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,300
Why do you mention her?

347
00:42:26,700 --> 00:42:27,600
I know why.

348
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,600
What do you mean?

349
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:31,600
Want to pay up?

350
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,600
Give up granny . Tonight.

351
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:34,800
Take it easy.

352
00:42:35,100 --> 00:42:36,300
She's one of ours. 
The rules say...

353
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:37,600
The rules...

354
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:40,900
Age limit is a rule too. 
She soon won't be...

355
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,600
...good for more than marrow paste.

356
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,700
She's my mother-in-law!

357
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:46,800
Take Mrs Interligator, that's all...

358
00:42:47,100 --> 00:42:48,000
...she wants.

359
00:42:48,400 --> 00:42:49,000
Quit yelling.

360
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:50,900
-Its charity. 
-Please.

361
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,700
Interligator needs his wife.

362
00:42:55,400 --> 00:42:57,000
And he's a good tenant: He pays!

363
00:42:57,400 --> 00:42:59,700
The damn rich always manage.

364
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:03,500
With your debts, you've no choice. 
Need I insist?

365
00:43:26,900 --> 00:43:28,800
It's you, Julie...

366
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,600
You scared me.

367
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:33,600
Counting your money again?

368
00:43:33,900 --> 00:43:36,100
Yes. Tell me...

369
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:39,300
It's rare to see you here.

370
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,500
That's nice of you.

371
00:43:42,200 --> 00:43:44,900
Like your gift?

372
00:43:45,600 --> 00:43:47,100
It must've cost you.

373
00:43:47,900 --> 00:43:51,100
Anything to make you happy.

374
00:43:51,500 --> 00:43:53,600
You've loved candy 
since you were little.

375
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:55,600
But I don't like it anymore.

376
00:44:05,500 --> 00:44:06,900
Let him go.

377
00:44:07,300 --> 00:44:10,700
You always ask that. 
It's the same thing each time.

378
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:13,500
No, this time...

379
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,300
So it is different, 
just look at you! I see his game.

380
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:21,200
Making your head spin 
with his puppy eyes, his dreams...

381
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:24,000
There's no room for dreams!

382
00:44:24,300 --> 00:44:25,000
Stop it!

383
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:27,700
It's a tough world 
and I didn't make it.

384
00:44:30,600 --> 00:44:32,000
You hate my trade.

385
00:44:32,400 --> 00:44:33,600
It's an art like any other!

386
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:35,800
Let him go.

387
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,600
And you'll go with him?

388
00:44:37,900 --> 00:44:39,800
You wont last 2 weeks!

389
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:41,300
And I wont lost u.

390
00:44:41,600 --> 00:44:43,800
You lost me long ago!

391
00:44:44,100 --> 00:44:45,000
Julie!

392
00:45:19,200 --> 00:45:22,600
TROGLODISM: 
AN UNDERGROUND ORGANIZATION?

393
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,700
Hi, girl.

394
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:30,800
Guess what? 
We'll play a game.

395
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:35,100
I scare you, you scream.

396
00:48:35,800 --> 00:48:37,100
and the clown upstairs...

397
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,200
...runs down to your rescue.

398
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:41,000
Shall we start?

399
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,300
What's wrong?

400
00:48:54,300 --> 00:48:55,900
Don't just stare!

401
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:57,900
Scream damnit!

402
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:21,700
You come from N.E. sector.

403
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:23,000
Just to bug us about...

404
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,400
...your Mr Whosit's troubles?

405
00:50:24,900 --> 00:50:25,500
Mr Louison.

406
00:50:25,800 --> 00:50:29,600
Don't know him! No more names, 
no more IDs. We're at war.

407
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:31,100
You're with outlaws!

408
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:32,500
He's Rolls. I'm January.

409
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:35,400
Voltange. Rolan. 
Tourneur. Milan. Trap.

410
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:37,600
Pank. Fox. Paumeau.

411
00:50:38,300 --> 00:50:40,400
We watch out for moles from up there.

412
00:50:40,700 --> 00:50:41,600
You could be one!

413
00:50:42,500 --> 00:50:43,600
I'm not a liar. 
It's true!

414
00:50:43,900 --> 00:50:46,500
You, a surfacer, 
talk about truth?

415
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:47,800
Look.

416
00:50:48,100 --> 00:50:49,700
Know what this is?

417
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:50,800
The shirt...

418
00:50:51,100 --> 00:50:51,900
...of our brother Matt.

419
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:53,900
Shot pointblank like a rabbit.

420
00:50:55,100 --> 00:50:56,100
That's truth!

421
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,000
Live game, that's what we are.

422
00:50:59,300 --> 00:51:00,600
And you're mad predators.

423
00:51:01,000 --> 00:51:01,900
I'm not, I swear!

424
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,000
You're one of them!

425
00:51:03,400 --> 00:51:04,200
A meatsucker!

426
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,000
Is that the way you talk ...

427
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:08,400
...to ladies in your rat hole?

428
00:51:16,500 --> 00:51:17,300
Careful!

429
00:51:20,200 --> 00:51:21,500
Oh my god!

430
00:51:23,800 --> 00:51:26,400
Tell Calamity Jane to straighten out.

431
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,300
Or hell will break loose.

432
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:29,500
Got it.

433
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:31,900
There's a month's harvest there.

434
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:33,200
Plus the risks involved.

435
00:51:33,600 --> 00:51:35,600
-Matt died for that. 
-Tell her.

436
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:39,100
Corn!

437
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,800
There's plenty in my building.

438
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,500
30 huge bags 
in my father's basement.

439
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,400
What's Whosit look like?

440
00:51:50,700 --> 00:51:52,000
His name's Louison.

441
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,100
The guy we're supposed to grab.

442
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:04,800
May I help you?

443
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:07,500
No... It's just 
an old coffee grinder.

444
00:52:07,900 --> 00:52:10,300
Coffee? Some have it made!

445
00:52:10,600 --> 00:52:14,000
So we went out for a walk 
last night? A long one too!

446
00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,200
There's ruckus, 
there're screams...

447
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,700
This place is really hopping!

448
00:52:19,100 --> 00:52:21,900
Your dad may work 
at night but still!

449
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,100
Oh Julie!

450
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:39,800
You OK?

451
00:52:44,100 --> 00:52:47,600
Sorry, I was 
rehearsing a new number.

452
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,100
Wait!

453
00:52:56,600 --> 00:52:57,400
Here...

454
00:53:03,800 --> 00:53:05,600
Didn't you hear anything last night?

455
00:53:06,600 --> 00:53:08,900
After your herbs, you kidding?

456
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:11,300
A teapot a night as you prescribed.

457
00:53:12,300 --> 00:53:14,500
I'll bring you more, 
you're almost out.

458
00:53:15,500 --> 00:53:18,400
You should drink some, 
you look overwrought.

459
00:53:26,300 --> 00:53:28,300
Cheer up, she died a natural death.

460
00:53:29,300 --> 00:53:30,000
Come on.

461
00:53:30,400 --> 00:53:31,600
Still,

462
00:53:32,800 --> 00:53:34,400
I'd like to say goodbye.

463
00:53:34,700 --> 00:53:36,300
We'll do that right now.

464
00:53:48,300 --> 00:53:49,900
My poor Robert...

465
00:53:51,500 --> 00:53:55,500
What made you rush 
into the stairs last night?

466
00:53:57,700 --> 00:54:01,100
I did it for Aurore. 
I wanted to save her.

467
00:54:01,400 --> 00:54:03,500
She wasn't the one who screamed!

468
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,800
Anyway... here!

469
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:10,200
Still, I did it for her.

470
00:54:10,500 --> 00:54:13,400
Besides, the butcher 
was very decent. He apologized.

471
00:54:13,900 --> 00:54:16,900
Invite you to dinner? 
Well, I haven't much...

472
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:19,300
Fine! We'll feel lighter.

473
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:21,600
9pm right?

474
00:54:21,900 --> 00:54:25,200
Sharp! I'm very punctual. 
Rather rare for a girl, no?

475
00:54:25,500 --> 00:54:27,900
For a girl, you're rather rare!

476
00:54:29,400 --> 00:54:31,500
I owe you alot, you know.

477
00:54:32,500 --> 00:54:33,600
Did you forgive?

478
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:35,400
Livingstone?

479
00:54:36,000 --> 00:54:37,900
One must always forgive.

480
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:41,700
Depends. It's not always possible.

481
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:44,900
Don't say that. 
No one is entirely evil.

482
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:46,800
Its circumstance.

483
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:50,200
Or they don't realize 
they've done wrong.

484
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:20,600
36th sector, 5th division, 
Wriggler's Avenue.

485
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:24,900
What'd that girl say?

486
00:55:25,300 --> 00:55:25,800
The girl!

487
00:55:29,300 --> 00:55:32,800
Sector 3/4 69deg N.E.

488
00:55:34,900 --> 00:55:36,700
Albumin Square, here!

489
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,300
Let's go!

490
00:55:39,700 --> 00:55:41,700
Scout to Sauce-Master.

491
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:44,800
Heading to target, 69 deg N.E.

492
00:55:45,500 --> 00:55:46,900
Sauce-Master to Scout.

493
00:55:48,200 --> 00:55:50,600
Read you, Roger.

494
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:55,200
Watch your steaks, guys!

495
00:56:15,300 --> 00:56:18,300
"Come Aurore..."

496
00:56:19,900 --> 00:56:22,700
"They are the worms..."

497
00:56:23,100 --> 00:56:26,300
"You are the fruit!"

498
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:41,700
Again? Shoot!

499
00:57:01,100 --> 00:57:02,700
It's rather quiet.

500
00:57:13,100 --> 00:57:15,000
No! Not father's clubs!

501
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,600
Yes, your father's clubs!

502
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:31,100
See who's on TV tonight?

503
00:57:31,500 --> 00:57:32,900
-I don't have a TV.  
-Look!

504
00:57:33,300 --> 00:57:35,800
That's your next customer, isn't it?

505
00:57:41,100 --> 00:57:42,600
I'll be damned!

506
00:57:44,700 --> 00:57:46,200
I've got to take off.

507
00:57:46,600 --> 00:57:49,100
No offense, 
but allow me the right...

508
00:57:49,500 --> 00:57:51,200
to come back tonight...

509
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:53,500
...and pay my thoughts to your daughter.

510
00:58:26,300 --> 00:58:27,100
Dangerous, what's that?

511
00:58:27,400 --> 00:58:28,100
Audacious, we're that!

512
00:58:28,900 --> 00:58:29,900
Courageous, I'll take three.

513
00:58:31,300 --> 00:58:33,900
Generous, U, U, U and me!

514
00:58:43,000 --> 00:58:44,700
Scout to Sauce-Master.

515
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:47,500
Corn located at site.

516
00:58:48,000 --> 00:58:49,800
I repeat: Corn located.

517
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:54,200
Proceeding with mission, 
phase B. Target: Louison.

518
00:58:54,600 --> 00:58:56,800
I repeat: Target, Louison.

519
00:59:35,900 --> 00:59:36,700
An ambush!

520
00:59:40,200 --> 00:59:42,100
Aurore, what's wrong now?

521
00:59:42,500 --> 00:59:43,600
Georges...

522
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:05,200
Throw in your apron?

523
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:08,900
Now I've heard everything!

524
01:00:09,500 --> 01:00:12,400
Its been on my mind a while... 
We're aging.

525
01:00:13,700 --> 01:00:16,800
I'm losing my touch. 
And so many victims...

526
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:18,700
I feel sorry for them.

527
01:00:19,000 --> 01:00:21,200
Sorry? 
That's not like you at all!

528
01:00:21,700 --> 01:00:24,400
No one's entirely evil. 
It's circumstance.

529
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:27,100
Or you don't realize 
you've done wrong.

530
01:00:27,500 --> 01:00:31,000
Some say you have to
forgive. You forgive me?

531
01:00:31,900 --> 01:00:33,700
An old bastard like you?

532
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:36,800
I bet I could.

533
01:00:37,500 --> 01:00:38,100
You are a dol.

534
01:00:38,600 --> 01:00:40,600
The guys you iced wouldn't forgive.

535
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:44,100
Or you'd have to insist.

536
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:46,700
Only Julie could forgive me.

537
01:00:47,100 --> 01:00:48,200
You ask her?

538
01:00:48,900 --> 01:00:50,300
She won't ever.

539
01:00:50,800 --> 01:00:52,200
You're her father.

540
01:00:52,600 --> 01:00:54,200
She won't even speak to me.

541
01:00:56,900 --> 01:01:00,400
Want me to see her? 
I could talk to her.

542
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,100
She only thinks about that Louison.

543
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:06,700
He's not a bad guy, after all.

544
01:01:07,100 --> 01:01:09,700
By the way, he's on TV tonight.

545
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,300
Why don't you go tell him?

546
01:01:12,800 --> 01:01:15,800
I bet he doesn't even know. 
He's in the clouds...

547
01:01:24,900 --> 01:01:27,400
Really, you should eat something.

548
01:01:28,100 --> 01:01:29,400
Not hungry!

549
01:01:34,200 --> 01:01:34,700
Fox!

550
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:49,300
You have been hiding things. 
You're on TV tonight.

551
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:51,200
How about that! 
Livingstone...

552
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,000
The Criekville Casino...

553
01:01:56,200 --> 01:01:59,200
I remember, we made a hit with 
the Tica Tica Walk.

554
01:01:59,500 --> 01:02:00,600
Tica Tica, what?

555
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:39,800
Oh shit.

556
01:02:41,600 --> 01:02:43,300
That's your new number?

557
01:02:44,000 --> 01:02:44,700
Let me...

558
01:02:45,100 --> 01:02:45,700
...explain...

559
01:02:46,100 --> 01:02:47,800
Sorry to disturb you.

560
01:02:54,600 --> 01:02:56,300
I goofed again!

561
01:03:04,600 --> 01:03:06,400
He has clown shoes alright.

562
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,500
Mission accomplished. 
Call in the others.

563
01:04:06,900 --> 01:04:09,200
Recipe 8: Cordon Bleu to Sniper.

564
01:04:11,200 --> 01:04:12,100
Quiet down!

565
01:04:12,500 --> 01:04:14,000
Artichoke Heart Souffl:

566
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,500
Preparation, H minus 35 minutes.

567
01:04:16,800 --> 01:04:17,900
Throw in the onions.

568
01:04:18,300 --> 01:04:19,800
Simmer the snipers.

569
01:04:20,100 --> 01:04:22,400
Cover them for 15 minutes.

570
01:04:22,700 --> 01:04:24,600
I repeat: 15 minutes.

571
01:04:25,300 --> 01:04:28,000
H minus 20 minutes: Stir the sauce.

572
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:31,000
I repeat: H minus 20 minutes.

573
01:04:41,300 --> 01:04:43,600
CIRCUS STARS

574
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:52,100
Julie! I didn't think you'd come.

575
01:04:55,700 --> 01:04:57,100
I'll have a cup of tea.

576
01:04:57,700 --> 01:04:58,800
Pardon?

577
01:04:59,300 --> 01:05:00,700
I'll have a cup of tea.

578
01:05:01,000 --> 01:05:02,400
A cup of tea?

579
01:05:03,700 --> 01:05:04,600
You have...

580
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:09,300
I'll have one too.

581
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:13,200
Yes a nice cup of tea!

582
01:05:16,800 --> 01:05:17,700
Aurore,...

583
01:05:18,500 --> 01:05:21,100
...come watch, it's captivating!

584
01:05:29,000 --> 01:05:32,800
"Come, Aurore"

585
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:36,000
"Come..."

586
01:05:58,100 --> 01:05:59,600
I got contact lens.

587
01:06:00,100 --> 01:06:02,000
"They'll make us weep and tremble..."

588
01:06:02,300 --> 01:06:04,500
"Here's Stan and Livingstone!"

589
01:06:15,600 --> 01:06:17,100
You didn't tell me.

590
01:06:18,500 --> 01:06:19,400
Julie...

591
01:06:20,100 --> 01:06:21,200
Livingstone...

592
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:23,300
Livingstone... Julie...

593
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:55,800
What a pain!

594
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:57,700
It's the antenna, pop!

595
01:06:58,100 --> 01:06:58,700
What a drag!

596
01:06:59,000 --> 01:06:59,900
It's the antenna.

597
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,000
Go straighten the wire.

598
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:04,100
In this storm ? No way!

599
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:11,600
Bastard!

600
01:07:14,500 --> 01:07:16,300
It's the antenna, with the wind.

601
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:28,400
Louison!

602
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:38,500
"Aurore..."

603
01:07:40,300 --> 01:07:41,900
"Come..."

604
01:07:45,100 --> 01:07:46,900
"It's so much better here with us..."

605
01:08:07,900 --> 01:08:09,800
"Come..."

606
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:25,000
Louison!

607
01:08:28,800 --> 01:08:29,700
Come back!

608
01:08:30,200 --> 01:08:31,300
I can't hear you.

609
01:08:33,800 --> 01:08:35,000
Come back!

610
01:08:36,600 --> 01:08:38,200
Go inside, Julie.

611
01:08:40,700 --> 01:08:42,100
Watch out!

612
01:08:59,700 --> 01:09:01,000
Mr Louison?

613
01:09:50,200 --> 01:09:52,200
To the right!

614
01:09:54,000 --> 01:09:55,000
More!

615
01:09:58,300 --> 01:09:59,200
Ok.

616
01:10:03,800 --> 01:10:05,500
That is perfect!

617
01:10:05,900 --> 01:10:06,600
Perfect!

618
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:08,100
Don't move!

619
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:13,900
Georges!

620
01:10:18,100 --> 01:10:20,300
Aurore...

621
01:10:46,300 --> 01:10:48,500
"...no more Robert..."

622
01:10:48,800 --> 01:10:49,600
I fell...

623
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:51,300
"...that pervert..."

624
01:10:51,700 --> 01:10:54,200
".. who just wants to sink you..."

625
01:10:54,600 --> 01:10:56,000
"...in the mire.."

626
01:10:56,400 --> 01:10:57,700
"Drag you in the sewer..."

627
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,600
"Fill you with manure..."

628
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:04,400
So it was you!

629
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:07,900
It was you all along...

630
01:11:08,400 --> 01:11:09,500
I swear I'll explain.

631
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:12,100
Bastard!

632
01:11:12,700 --> 01:11:13,800
It came from downstairs.

633
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:15,800
I'll hurt your leg, Robert!

634
01:11:17,700 --> 01:11:19,700
Stop!

635
01:11:31,700 --> 01:11:33,700
help!

636
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,600
You crumb! Son of a bitch!

637
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:44,000
I fell.

638
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:45,500
Yes, Aurore.

639
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:48,600
I wanted to stand 
on the chair, I fell.

640
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:50,000
Yes Aurore.

641
01:12:04,400 --> 01:12:05,500
The Troglos!

642
01:12:06,300 --> 01:12:08,200
The Troglos are kidnapping someone!

643
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:27,400
Nice of you to make coffee.

644
01:12:28,400 --> 01:12:29,800
Expecting company?

645
01:12:35,400 --> 01:12:36,400
Undress.

646
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,500
Julie come on!

647
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,200
The Interligator woman 
blew herself sky high.

648
01:13:00,500 --> 01:13:04,200
She took her husband with
her. The place's in flame.

649
01:13:04,500 --> 01:13:06,300
Stop them! Robert!

650
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:13,000
What're you doing here?

651
01:13:13,400 --> 01:13:15,200
Wipe that stuff off now,

652
01:13:16,200 --> 01:13:18,900
...and go home
immediately, hear me?

653
01:13:19,300 --> 01:13:20,500
Take the lipstick off!

654
01:13:20,800 --> 01:13:21,900
And you, I'll skin you alive!

655
01:13:22,300 --> 01:13:24,100
Wait, I'll get u!

656
01:13:24,500 --> 01:13:26,700
I'll get u!

657
01:13:36,900 --> 01:13:37,800
Who's coming?

658
01:13:38,100 --> 01:13:39,000
Snipers!

659
01:13:42,900 --> 01:13:46,200
How did it go? Alright?

660
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:47,900
Everybody OK?

661
01:13:48,900 --> 01:13:51,000
Look what I found.

662
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,900
And the others?

663
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:04,300
How did it go?

664
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,300
They were all arms...
a real joy ride!

665
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:09,300
And we're all here.

666
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:11,600
Shit!

667
01:14:14,100 --> 01:14:15,500
Where'd she come from?

668
01:14:17,200 --> 01:14:17,900
Shit!

669
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:21,500
That the guy to grab?

670
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,500
That the one you located?

671
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:27,800
Can you explain?

672
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:29,200
What?

673
01:14:29,600 --> 01:14:30,700
Wasn't that the plan?

674
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:33,300
"Albumin Square. Name: Louison."

675
01:14:33,700 --> 01:14:35,000
Here, that's what it says.

676
01:14:35,400 --> 01:14:38,100
It also says,
"Sex: male. Shoes: clown's."

677
01:14:38,500 --> 01:14:39,900
What do you say to that?

678
01:14:40,300 --> 01:14:41,700
We'd better check.

679
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:45,300
Sex: male!

680
01:14:46,100 --> 01:14:47,100
So?

681
01:14:47,700 --> 01:14:48,800
Look in the package and tell me...

682
01:14:49,200 --> 01:14:50,400
...if the sex is male. Alright?

683
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:54,300
That's not my job. Mission
Louison was the package. You got it.

684
01:14:57,500 --> 01:15:00,300
Is the sex in the
package male or not?

685
01:15:04,000 --> 01:15:05,800
Who knows?

686
01:15:17,400 --> 01:15:18,600
I'm in a loony bin!

687
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:21,700
I've had it with this bullshit!

688
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:24,100
There's been a mistake. 
Let me go!

689
01:15:24,500 --> 01:15:26,300
See guys, pure female!

690
01:15:29,500 --> 01:15:32,800
Cordon Bleu calling Onion snipers...

691
01:15:33,200 --> 01:15:34,500
Artichoke Heart.

692
01:15:34,800 --> 01:15:37,200
I repeat: 
Artichoke Heart in immediate danger!

693
01:15:40,300 --> 01:15:43,600
Cordon Bleu calling Onion Snipers...

694
01:15:44,400 --> 01:15:47,500
Artichoke Heart in immediate danger!

695
01:15:47,900 --> 01:15:49,700
We'll pick them off like flies.

696
01:15:51,200 --> 01:15:52,900
Must be cooking up there.

697
01:15:53,700 --> 01:15:55,000
Count on those weirdos,

698
01:15:55,300 --> 01:15:56,800
they'll fix your buddy..

699
01:15:57,200 --> 01:15:58,000
for good.

700
01:15:58,400 --> 01:15:59,400
What do you say? we go?

701
01:15:59,700 --> 01:16:01,000
Of course we're going!

702
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:02,200
All together!

703
01:16:02,600 --> 01:16:03,500
Doesn't she ever shut up?

704
01:16:03,900 --> 01:16:05,200
They play too rough.

705
01:16:05,800 --> 01:16:06,400
A contract...

706
01:16:06,900 --> 01:16:07,600
is a contract.

707
01:16:10,400 --> 01:16:11,600
Who's not in?

708
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,600
Rap, you come with me.

709
01:16:13,900 --> 01:16:16,200
Milan, Fox Tourneur...

710
01:16:16,400 --> 01:16:17,900
Take the others. Move it!

711
01:16:18,300 --> 01:16:19,200
What about me?

712
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,300
What about me?

713
01:16:21,300 --> 01:16:23,400
Don't forget me!

714
01:16:23,700 --> 01:16:24,800
What about me?

715
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:27,000
What about me?

716
01:16:29,800 --> 01:16:30,600
Bastards!

717
01:16:48,900 --> 01:16:50,400
In case I don't come back.

718
01:16:53,800 --> 01:16:54,800
Open up!

719
01:16:57,700 --> 01:17:02,000
You dimwit, give up,
we'll let you go.

720
01:17:02,300 --> 01:17:05,000
We won't touch you.

721
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,600
We forget the whole thing.

722
01:17:08,400 --> 01:17:09,500
Alright?

723
01:17:13,300 --> 01:17:15,200
I need my cleavers! All of them!

724
01:17:15,400 --> 01:17:17,800
Right, the cleavers!
We'll slaughter them!

725
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,600
Think you're on safari, bitch?

726
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:21,600
That's my wife!

727
01:17:21,900 --> 01:17:23,800
No men or women now, 
only volunteers!

728
01:17:24,200 --> 01:17:25,300
Precisely!

729
01:17:25,700 --> 01:17:27,100
Obedient ones!

730
01:17:29,900 --> 01:17:30,900
Touch one...

731
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:35,500
Just one hair of my daughter
and I'll slice you into pieces.

732
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:40,100
Go get my cleavers. Hoof it!

733
01:17:40,400 --> 01:17:41,600
On the double!

734
01:17:52,200 --> 01:17:53,400
Where are you?

735
01:17:59,700 --> 01:18:01,200
Where are you?

736
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:04,900
I don't like this.

737
01:18:09,100 --> 01:18:10,400
It won't be long now.

738
01:18:11,300 --> 01:18:13,300
Julie, go away!

739
01:18:14,300 --> 01:18:17,700
It's me they're after.

740
01:18:18,700 --> 01:18:22,200
Don't cry. I'll manage.

741
01:18:23,100 --> 01:18:23,900
Don't cry.

742
01:18:24,200 --> 01:18:25,400
It's my contacts.

743
01:18:25,700 --> 01:18:26,400
What?

744
01:20:23,900 --> 01:20:24,900
What are you up to?

745
01:20:25,200 --> 01:20:25,800
Move your ass.

746
01:20:26,100 --> 01:20:27,500
I can't. I've gained weight.

747
01:20:32,900 --> 01:20:34,700
Wait... come back!

748
01:20:35,100 --> 01:20:36,800
Tourneur, wait!

749
01:20:43,400 --> 01:20:45,600
Shit, Tourneur's been hit!

750
01:20:45,800 --> 01:20:47,600
Shit, Tourneur's been hit!

751
01:21:01,700 --> 01:21:03,100
Hey Postman, things OK?

752
01:21:03,300 --> 01:21:05,000
I got one. Come see.

753
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,100
Those monsters are everywhere.

754
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,500
They've lost one, 
they won't be back.

755
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,800
Good old Tourneur hang on!

756
01:21:39,300 --> 01:21:41,200
That lead weighs you down...

757
01:21:43,300 --> 01:21:44,800
No other damage?

758
01:21:46,200 --> 01:21:47,800
We'll clear you out.

759
01:21:48,100 --> 01:21:49,100
You'll be alright!

760
01:22:24,300 --> 01:22:25,600
Let's get this over with!

761
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:05,900
Come on, push!

762
01:23:10,300 --> 01:23:11,600
Let me by!

763
01:23:26,200 --> 01:23:27,600
Water's running.

764
01:23:29,300 --> 01:23:30,800
What the hell are they doing?

765
01:23:31,200 --> 01:23:32,700
Stand back!

766
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:37,300
What are they up to?

767
01:24:02,200 --> 01:24:03,800
Marcel!

768
01:24:13,900 --> 01:24:14,700
Marcel!

769
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:37,100
Are you alright, Marcel?

770
01:24:37,400 --> 01:24:40,100
Come on, get up!

771
01:24:40,400 --> 01:24:41,700
Get up!

772
01:25:05,400 --> 01:25:08,000
Go on! Go!

773
01:25:14,000 --> 01:25:16,200
Julie, follow me!

774
01:25:24,200 --> 01:25:24,800
Careful!

775
01:25:36,300 --> 01:25:36,900
Julie!

776
01:25:52,100 --> 01:25:53,500
About time!

777
01:25:54,700 --> 01:25:55,500
Miss please...

778
01:25:55,800 --> 01:25:58,900
You're dragonfly 
in a mating season...

779
01:25:59,100 --> 01:26:00,600
...so an old toad like me...

780
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,500
Beat it, old jerk, I'm busy.

781
01:26:03,900 --> 01:26:05,700
Let the lady by, will you?

782
01:26:06,100 --> 01:26:08,500
I go from one footbath 
to another... Just my luck!

783
01:26:15,000 --> 01:26:16,900
I despise you, hate you!

784
01:26:31,800 --> 01:26:33,900
This time, you're done for, clown.

785
01:26:38,700 --> 01:26:39,600
No more bullshit!

786
01:26:42,100 --> 01:26:43,700
You're gonna sing my song!

787
01:26:49,000 --> 01:26:50,100
A cleaver, damnit!

788
01:26:51,100 --> 01:26:51,900
Move it!

789
01:26:52,300 --> 01:26:54,000
-Take this. 
-You, here?

790
01:26:54,800 --> 01:26:56,500
This is a job for the Australian.

791
01:27:01,700 --> 01:27:02,600
Anyway...

792
01:27:03,500 --> 01:27:04,600
...you come in handy.

793
01:27:21,100 --> 01:27:21,800
Holy shit!

794
01:27:22,600 --> 01:27:24,100
Goddamn, Troglos!

795
01:27:31,500 --> 01:27:33,000
Bastards, my Julie!

796
01:27:33,300 --> 01:27:34,200
My Julie!

797
01:27:35,600 --> 01:27:37,400
It's your fault, you'll pay!

798
01:27:56,700 --> 01:27:59,700
Have I got something there?

799
01:28:01,900 --> 01:28:04,100
Answer me, meathead!

800
01:28:06,700 --> 01:28:09,300
You tell me...

801
01:28:09,900 --> 01:28:13,100
I'm not dreaming... 
I got something right?
