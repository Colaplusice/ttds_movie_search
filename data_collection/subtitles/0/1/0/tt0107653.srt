1
00:01:07,511 --> 00:01:09,138
I'm gonna tell my Bernard of you!!

2
00:01:09,722 --> 00:01:11,181
You fuckin' dead!

3
00:01:49,847 --> 00:01:53,142
Oi! Come back 'ere, you!

4
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,186
Ronnie !

5
00:01:55,937 --> 00:01:58,689
Geroff that couch and come out 'ere!

6
00:04:32,308 --> 00:04:35,103
Oh, shit!
Sorry, I didn't see you there.

7
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:37,564
Do you live 'ere?

8
00:04:37,772 --> 00:04:39,858
Yeah, I do unfortunately.

9
00:04:40,358 --> 00:04:41,943
Do you know Louise Clancy ?

10
00:04:42,152 --> 00:04:44,029
Yeah. Are you friend of hers?

11
00:04:44,321 --> 00:04:45,488
Know where she is?

12
00:04:45,906 --> 00:04:47,157
She's at work

13
00:04:48,825 --> 00:04:50,202
What time does she get back?

14
00:04:50,369 --> 00:04:52,371
Dunno. About seven or something

15
00:04:52,579 --> 00:04:53,956
Fuckin' hell !

16
00:04:59,003 --> 00:05:00,671
D'you wanna come in for a cuppa tea?

17
00:05:03,174 --> 00:05:04,425
Is it alright with you, love?

18
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,761
It's just, you know, cold

19
00:05:07,219 --> 00:05:09,263
Listen, have you got anything for a headache?

20
00:05:10,097 --> 00:05:11,766
Ah, yeah, we 'ave as it 'appens

21
00:05:11,849 --> 00:05:13,851
You know, like a monkey-wrench or somethin'

22
00:05:15,562 --> 00:05:16,855
What's all this about?

23
00:05:17,564 --> 00:05:19,065
Oh yeah, that's Sandra, that is

24
00:05:19,649 --> 00:05:20,859
Hallo, Sandra.

25
00:05:21,693 --> 00:05:23,028
This is 'er place

26
00:05:23,111 --> 00:05:24,821
She's a fuckin' nurse

27
00:05:24,905 --> 00:05:27,324
That's 'er idea of interior design

28
00:05:27,824 --> 00:05:29,201
Oh yeah - it's a skeletion

29
00:05:29,493 --> 00:05:31,620
And this is 'er cocktail cabinet, an' all

30
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:35,082
There you go, that should do it

31
00:05:35,582 --> 00:05:36,792
No, it's too big

32
00:05:39,086 --> 00:05:40,254
D'you want a cuppa tea?

33
00:05:42,131 --> 00:05:44,425
So are you Louise's boyfriend?

34
00:05:45,051 --> 00:05:45,885
No.

35
00:05:47,637 --> 00:05:48,805
Oh, right. What, you're just like a mate?

36
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,181
Primate

37
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:52,016
You must be the missing link then

38
00:05:52,225 --> 00:05:53,685
Yeah, that's me

39
00:05:55,186 --> 00:05:56,771
You're not gonna tell me your name?

40
00:05:57,021 --> 00:05:57,939
No.

41
00:05:58,690 --> 00:05:59,941
I'm not gonna tell you mine neither

42
00:06:00,275 --> 00:06:01,610
All right, we'll be strangers

43
00:06:03,236 --> 00:06:06,531
- I see your boomerang came back then, love
- It's not my fuckin' boomerang

44
00:06:06,698 --> 00:06:09,117
What about the old diminishing pachyderm formation there?

45
00:06:09,243 --> 00:06:11,703
No, that's all Sandra's collection

46
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,163
She's in Zimbabwe at the moment.

47
00:06:14,206 --> 00:06:17,042
And fuck knows what she's gonna bring back from there

48
00:06:17,293 --> 00:06:19,545
Pellagra or hepatitis B or something.

49
00:06:19,920 --> 00:06:21,714
She's with her boyfriend

50
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,392
So how is Louise?

51
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,438
I dunno.
I don't know 'er as well as you.

52
00:06:36,688 --> 00:06:37,605
D'you get on with 'er?

53
00:06:37,856 --> 00:06:39,816
We've been out a couple o' times.

54
00:06:40,817 --> 00:06:41,860
Does she like you?

55
00:06:42,486 --> 00:06:44,154
I dunno - you'd better ask 'er.

56
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:47,407
Most people don't.

57
00:06:47,658 --> 00:06:49,743
Do you find she's at all jealous of you?

58
00:06:59,295 --> 00:07:02,423
So, I dunno, would you describe yourself as a happy little person?

59
00:07:03,132 --> 00:07:05,218
Yeah, I'm the life and soul

60
00:07:08,346 --> 00:07:09,347
Have you ever thought, right

61
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:10,765
I mean, you don't know,

62
00:07:10,848 --> 00:07:12,517
but you may already 'ave had

63
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:15,103
the happiest moment in your whole fuckin' life

64
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:17,647
and all you've got to look forward to is sickness

65
00:07:17,689 --> 00:07:18,940
and purgatory?

66
00:07:20,942 --> 00:07:22,110
Oh, shit!

67
00:07:23,695 --> 00:07:27,741
Well, I just live from day to day, meself.

68
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,244
I tend to skip a day now and again - you know what I mean?

69
00:07:30,828 --> 00:07:31,912
I used to be a werewolf,

70
00:07:32,037 --> 00:07:35,124
- But I'm all right noowwww!!
- Oh, fuckin' 'ell !!

71
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,960
I bet they're 'appy, eh?

72
00:07:38,044 --> 00:07:41,214
All they gotta do is sit round, howlin' at the moon.

73
00:07:41,297 --> 00:07:44,112
It's better than standin' on the cheesy fuckin' thing. Know what I mean?

74
00:07:44,675 --> 00:07:47,220
I mean, tossin' all these satellites and shuttles out into the cosmos -

75
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:49,973
what do they think they're gonna find up there that they can't find down 'ere?

76
00:07:50,223 --> 00:07:51,516
They think if they piss high enough,

77
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,769
they're gonna come across the monkey with the beard and the crap ideas,

78
00:07:54,894 --> 00:07:57,230
and it's like, 'Oh! There you are Captain!

79
00:07:57,856 --> 00:08:00,692
I mean , are you busy, because I've got a few fundamental questions for you!'

80
00:08:01,443 --> 00:08:02,486
Are you with me?

81
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:07,491
Yeah, 'cos let's face it, right, what are rockets?

82
00:08:07,699 --> 00:08:10,703
I mean, they're just , big metal pricks!

83
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,291
You know, I mean, the bastards aren't satisfied with fuckin' the earth up -

84
00:08:15,374 --> 00:08:17,877
they've gotta fuck space an' all.

85
00:08:18,002 --> 00:08:19,170
Will you tell me something, love?

86
00:08:21,005 --> 00:08:25,051
Are you aware of the effect you have on the average

87
00:08:25,343 --> 00:08:27,387
mammalian, Mancunian,

88
00:08:27,512 --> 00:08:31,224
X-Y-ly-chromosome, slavering, lusty male member

89
00:08:31,307 --> 00:08:32,517
of the species?

90
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,688
- Yeah
- I thought so.

91
00:08:51,036 --> 00:08:52,913
Would you like to have dinner with me tonight?

92
00:08:53,372 --> 00:08:54,290
No !

93
00:08:55,541 --> 00:08:57,793
Do you think women like being raped?

94
00:08:58,461 --> 00:08:59,629
You talk a lot, don't you?

95
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,840
Do you like japanese food?

96
00:09:03,383 --> 00:09:04,926
Look, I've told you -  I'm not interested.

97
00:09:05,343 --> 00:09:06,135
All right?

98
00:09:06,344 --> 00:09:07,762
Could I have that a touch harder, please?

99
00:09:32,288 --> 00:09:34,290
All right? Enjoyin' yourself, are you?

100
00:09:35,291 --> 00:09:37,418
I'm 'aving a great time, actually

101
00:09:43,508 --> 00:09:44,133
Bloody 'ell

102
00:09:44,592 --> 00:09:45,969
Oh, friendly!

103
00:09:46,594 --> 00:09:48,722
What are you doin' 'ere? You look like shit.

104
00:09:49,139 --> 00:09:50,390
Just trying to blend in

105
00:09:50,515 --> 00:09:51,683
with the surroundings

106
00:09:56,355 --> 00:09:58,023
Halitosis, halitosis, halitosis!

107
00:10:02,194 --> 00:10:03,195
Can't believe you're 'ere

108
00:10:03,696 --> 00:10:04,738
I'm not 'ere.

109
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:09,326
I'll tell you what, it's a crackin' place you've got, love.

110
00:10:09,618 --> 00:10:10,619
Good. I'm glad you like it.

111
00:10:11,037 --> 00:10:12,705
No, I was been sarcastic.

112
00:10:13,831 --> 00:10:16,459
Why didn't you tell me you were comin'? I would a' met you off the train.

113
00:10:16,542 --> 00:10:17,794
I didn't come on the fuckin' train.

114
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,379
- Off the bus, then.
- I didn't come on the bus either.

115
00:10:19,712 --> 00:10:21,005
So 'ow did you get 'ere then?

116
00:10:21,923 --> 00:10:25,802
Well, basically, there was this little dot, right? And the dot went bang,

117
00:10:25,885 --> 00:10:27,178
and the bang expanded,

118
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:31,475
energy formed into matter, matter cooled, matter lived, the amoeba to fish, the fish to fowl, the fowl to frog, the frog to mammal

119
00:10:32,392 --> 00:10:33,977
the mammal to monkey, the monkey to man.

120
00:10:34,186 --> 00:10:35,187
Amo, amas, amat, quid pro quo, memento mori,

121
00:10:35,520 --> 00:10:40,317
ad infinitum, sprinkle on a little bit of grated cheese and leave under the grill till Doomsday.

122
00:10:40,818 --> 00:10:41,902
I see you 'aven't changed.

123
00:10:42,069 --> 00:10:44,196
'e's a fuckin' genius, this geezer!

124
00:10:44,572 --> 00:10:46,615
I take it you've met my wicky-wacky friend Sophie?

125
00:10:48,784 --> 00:10:51,287
No, actually, we 'aven't been formally introduced, 'ave we, love?

126
00:10:51,495 --> 00:10:52,288
No, we've been sat 'ere in

127
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:54,499
embarassin' silence all afternoon.

128
00:10:57,126 --> 00:10:58,670
So , 'ow are you?

129
00:10:58,795 --> 00:10:59,712
Peachy-creamy.

130
00:11:03,466 --> 00:11:05,719
Are you really? I'm very pleased.

131
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:10,390
So how's, um, work?

132
00:11:10,682 --> 00:11:12,768
It's all right.

133
00:11:13,518 --> 00:11:14,686
Is it everything you hoped it would be?

134
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:17,564
What did you hope it would be?

135
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:25,072
I'm sorry - did you get that?

136
00:11:26,323 --> 00:11:27,950
It's everything she hoped it would be,

137
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:30,077
but she doesn't fuckin' know what she hoped it would be!

138
00:11:30,494 --> 00:11:33,748
Oh, and by the way. Thank you for this!

139
00:11:33,831 --> 00:11:35,792
I mean, are you tekkin' the piss,

140
00:11:35,917 --> 00:11:36,960
or what?

141
00:11:38,711 --> 00:11:42,340
'So, Johnny... My address is'

142
00:11:47,804 --> 00:11:48,847
I'm touched.

143
00:11:52,893 --> 00:11:55,062
- Why 'ave you come?
- Oh, can you tell from there?

144
00:11:57,648 --> 00:11:58,565
D'you want a cup o'tea?

145
00:11:58,857 --> 00:12:00,943
I'd love a cup o'tea. You're fuckin'

146
00:12:01,151 --> 00:12:02,486
generous, you cockerneys, aren't yer?

147
00:12:03,529 --> 00:12:04,363
Yeah. Ta.

148
00:12:37,648 --> 00:12:38,691
'ow's yer mam?

149
00:12:38,857 --> 00:12:40,776
Fine. 'ow's yours? Still pullin' pints?

150
00:12:41,193 --> 00:12:44,113
She's dead. She's still a good fuck, though.

151
00:12:46,449 --> 00:12:49,327
I mean the rates are a bit extortionate, but I do get a discount, what with being the son and everything.

152
00:12:50,453 --> 00:12:51,204
Apparently, right, you shouldn't stick

153
00:12:51,287 --> 00:12:53,081
anything up your cunt

154
00:12:53,164 --> 00:12:54,540
you can't put in your mouth.

155
00:12:55,458 --> 00:12:56,209
Give us that mug.

156
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:01,423
Can I try your coat on, Johnny?

157
00:13:06,303 --> 00:13:08,138
So what you've been up to? 'ave you seen anybody?

158
00:13:08,263 --> 00:13:09,598
Have you seen anybody?

159
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,269
Have you spoken to anybody from Manchester?

160
00:13:14,353 --> 00:13:16,146
Yeah, I've phoned June a couple o' times.

161
00:13:16,230 --> 00:13:18,148
And was June interested in what you had to say?

162
00:13:21,235 --> 00:13:24,530
Fuckin' hell. I've seen more life in an open grave. Come on!!

163
00:13:24,363 --> 00:13:27,366
- What?
- What?! I mean, you don't not seem very pleased to see me.

164
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:29,243
I am pleased to see you!

165
00:13:29,327 --> 00:13:32,080
Are you too good for us? Now you've got yourself a posh job in a big 'shitty'?

166
00:13:32,163 --> 00:13:33,039
I mean, me an''her

167
00:13:33,164 --> 00:13:35,125
- are on the fuckin' dole, aren't we?
- Right!

168
00:13:35,333 --> 00:13:37,627
And you're a carrier girl - are you happy with that?
Are you sure?

169
00:13:38,128 --> 00:13:39,296
I'm delighted

170
00:13:45,218 --> 00:13:46,678
D'you want some o' this,

171
00:13:47,304 --> 00:13:48,138
Johnny ?

172
00:13:49,473 --> 00:13:52,518
Fuckin' 'ell love, what're you trying to do to me?

173
00:13:58,566 --> 00:13:59,608
Right, well,

174
00:13:59,775 --> 00:14:01,902
I'm going up to me room. D'you want to see it, Johnny?

175
00:14:01,986 --> 00:14:02,695
Is it worth the bother?

176
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,488
Is there anything worth seein'?

177
00:14:04,572 --> 00:14:07,325
Why don't you come and find out? It's not very far.

178
00:14:18,753 --> 00:14:19,921
I'm sorry about this.

179
00:14:34,436 --> 00:14:35,792
Move! Move!

180
00:14:43,905 --> 00:14:44,864
Where are you?

181
00:14:45,031 --> 00:14:46,282
I'm in 'ere.

182
00:14:49,577 --> 00:14:50,787
Oh, it's de-lovely.

183
00:14:51,746 --> 00:14:54,228
I see you've got a ceiling at the top with a floor on the lower level,

184
00:14:54,374 --> 00:14:56,084
and a wall at either side.

185
00:14:56,585 --> 00:14:59,171
And only a single bed. Sad, really

186
00:15:11,058 --> 00:15:12,643
You've got wonderful breasts

187
00:15:13,227 --> 00:15:14,478
Don't you mean tits?

188
00:15:14,812 --> 00:15:16,105
Are they both of the same size,

189
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,857
or is one bigger than the other?

190
00:15:18,816 --> 00:15:20,818
I don't know. Do you want to weigh them?

191
00:15:22,612 --> 00:15:23,654
Is that a proposition?

192
00:15:23,905 --> 00:15:25,031
No, it's a threat.

193
00:15:34,291 --> 00:15:35,125
Are you rich?

194
00:15:37,210 --> 00:15:39,713
- Life is for enjoying.
- What's about family,

195
00:15:40,130 --> 00:15:41,089
have you got any brothers or sisters?

196
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:42,633
I try not to remember.

197
00:15:45,719 --> 00:15:46,637
You are sexually

198
00:15:46,845 --> 00:15:48,055
frustrated, aren't you?

199
00:15:49,306 --> 00:15:50,891
- What's funny?
- Are you a feminist?

200
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,812
- Do you like fucking?
- Do you like wanking?

201
00:15:55,271 --> 00:15:56,314
Not on my own, no.

202
00:16:04,072 --> 00:16:06,950
That's a very ornithological mutilation you've got here, love.

203
00:16:07,158 --> 00:16:09,327
That's my tribal initiation

204
00:16:10,829 --> 00:16:11,705
It is really?

205
00:16:21,131 --> 00:16:22,466
That was fuckin' athletic, that was.

206
00:16:23,008 --> 00:16:24,218
I think I've ruptured my chakras.

207
00:16:26,637 --> 00:16:28,389
Is there an instruction manual for this garb?

208
00:16:28,931 --> 00:16:31,225
No, it's an intelligence test.

209
00:16:31,434 --> 00:16:33,894
Well what is this? A granny, a sheepshank,

210
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,689
or the infamous round-turn and two half-hitches,

211
00:16:36,814 --> 00:16:38,775
as mentioned in the Book of Ezekiel?

212
00:16:38,941 --> 00:16:40,193
Have you finished?

213
00:16:40,526 --> 00:16:41,653
I've hardly fuckin' begun.

214
00:16:41,861 --> 00:16:46,199
It's just that I think I'm gonna get into difficulties when I read the hippy-shit up here, you know what I mean?

215
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:49,119
Yeah, well, you've tried the stairs.

216
00:16:49,661 --> 00:16:51,288
I think we should take the escalator.

217
00:16:52,455 --> 00:16:55,250
Simple really. So's this.

218
00:16:56,501 --> 00:16:57,628
Oh. Thanks for the mammaries.

219
00:17:00,047 --> 00:17:01,173
Could you ask her to order me a taxi,

220
00:17:01,298 --> 00:17:02,257
please?

221
00:17:02,466 --> 00:17:03,550
This is terribly disappointing

222
00:17:04,343 --> 00:17:05,552
You don't like rejection, do you,

223
00:17:05,678 --> 00:17:07,805
- Jeremy?
- Could we have a taxi, please?

224
00:17:08,138 --> 00:17:09,849
No problem, sir.

225
00:18:57,628 --> 00:18:59,380
It's really cozy, this.

226
00:19:02,842 --> 00:19:04,301
Will you let me come again, Jerry?

227
00:19:07,596 --> 00:19:09,098
You're dead handsome, you know.

228
00:19:13,811 --> 00:19:15,188
What work d'you do?

229
00:19:18,775 --> 00:19:20,568
I'm a dancer, actually.

230
00:19:23,488 --> 00:19:24,823
Do you want to know me name?

231
00:19:26,158 --> 00:19:27,284
It's Giselle.

232
00:19:30,329 --> 00:19:31,663
Are you married?

233
00:19:37,711 --> 00:19:38,671
Wha' ?

234
00:19:41,423 --> 00:19:42,466
Kiss me.

235
00:20:00,735 --> 00:20:04,030
Don't, it's yucky! Get it off!

236
00:20:09,077 --> 00:20:10,287
Are you glad I came?

237
00:20:12,206 --> 00:20:13,874
What are you doin'? Get off me!!

238
00:20:18,879 --> 00:20:20,214
You're hurting me!

239
00:20:20,798 --> 00:20:22,007
Have you ever thought of committing

240
00:20:22,174 --> 00:20:23,092
suicide?

241
00:20:23,342 --> 00:20:24,719
I'm going to commit suicide.

242
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:26,512
on my fortieth birthday.

243
00:20:28,139 --> 00:20:29,140
If I'm still around.

244
00:20:29,807 --> 00:20:31,017
- Why?
- I don't want to be old.

245
00:20:31,434 --> 00:20:32,477
Do you?

246
00:21:29,995 --> 00:21:31,580
Oh. 'Ave a fag

247
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:33,040
Yeah. Thanks, I will

248
00:21:44,385 --> 00:21:45,428
What you're readin'?

249
00:21:58,024 --> 00:21:59,901
Would you stop fuckin' about and fidgetin' in my peripherals -

250
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:01,194
I'm trying to concentrate.

251
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:03,447
She's got a very little waist, Sophie, an't she?

252
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:07,785
She's got little tits an' all

253
00:22:12,414 --> 00:22:13,415
Are you not cold?

254
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:16,919
- I'm reading about the Butterfly Effect.
- What's the Butterfly Effect?

255
00:22:17,628 --> 00:22:20,214
Every time a butterfly flaps its wings in Tokyo,

256
00:22:20,381 --> 00:22:22,550
this old granny in Salford gets a bilious attack..

257
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:25,303
What happens if a butterfly flaps it's wings in Salford?

258
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:27,680
That's not the point.

259
00:22:28,014 --> 00:22:29,098
Oh, is it not?

260
00:22:32,435 --> 00:22:33,478
What are you doin' in London, Johnny?

261
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,230
What are you doin' in London?

262
00:22:35,355 --> 00:22:36,940
I've told you what I'm doin' in London.

263
00:22:37,357 --> 00:22:38,483
You've told me nothing.

264
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,653
The last time I saw you,

265
00:22:41,987 --> 00:22:43,780
- I told you -
- Fuckin' hell! Were you born irritatin'?

266
00:22:45,491 --> 00:22:46,825
What you came downstairs for anyway?

267
00:22:47,117 --> 00:22:49,578
I fell asleep with the window open. I was cold. I came down.

268
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:52,540
I 'ad to pee, I've made some tea, I'm 'ere, all right?

269
00:22:52,873 --> 00:22:54,333
What's that? The greatest story ever told?

270
00:22:54,667 --> 00:22:55,793
I live 'ere

271
00:23:00,381 --> 00:23:01,924
So what 'appened? Were you bored

272
00:23:02,175 --> 00:23:02,800
in Manchester?

273
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:07,889
Was I bored? No I wasn't fuckin' bored.

274
00:23:08,097 --> 00:23:09,849
I'm never bored. That's the trouble with everybody - you're all so bored.

275
00:23:10,934 --> 00:23:13,144
You've 'ad nature explained to you and you're bored with it.

276
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:15,897
You've 'ad the living body explained to you and you're bored with it,

277
00:23:16,106 --> 00:23:18,442
You've had the universe explained to you and you're bored with it.

278
00:23:19,026 --> 00:23:21,612
So now you just want cheap thrills and like plenty of 'em and it dun't matter

279
00:23:21,737 --> 00:23:24,406
'ow tawdry or vacuous they are as long as it's new, as long as it's new,

280
00:23:24,948 --> 00:23:27,326
as long as it flashes and fuckin' bleeps in forty fuckin' different colors.

281
00:23:28,202 --> 00:23:30,871
Well, whatever else you can say about me, I'm not fuckin' bored!

282
00:23:31,163 --> 00:23:32,164
Yeah, all right.

283
00:23:34,208 --> 00:23:35,418
So 'ow's it all goin' for you?

284
00:23:36,502 --> 00:23:38,171
It's a bit borin', actually.

285
00:23:39,255 --> 00:23:40,465
Are you not enjoyin' yourself?

286
00:23:43,593 --> 00:23:44,844
Have you made many friends?

287
00:23:47,055 --> 00:23:47,514
No

288
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:51,476
'Ave you got, erm, a goblet or something, because me heart's bleedin'.

289
00:23:54,938 --> 00:23:56,648
When you goin' back to Manchester?

290
00:23:56,857 --> 00:23:57,941
When you goin' back to Manchester?

291
00:23:58,442 --> 00:23:59,693
I'm not going back

292
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,528
- Why not?
- You know why not

293
00:24:01,612 --> 00:24:02,446
Do I?

294
00:24:05,324 --> 00:24:07,534
I thought you said you never wanted to see me again

295
00:24:07,701 --> 00:24:10,121
I don't want to ever see you again, so why you just don't fuck off back upstairs?

296
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:11,539
Why are you such a bastard, Johnny?

297
00:24:12,748 --> 00:24:15,710
- Monkey see, monkey do.
- And what does that mean?

298
00:24:20,673 --> 00:24:21,674
Oh, this fuckin' cough.

299
00:24:22,258 --> 00:24:24,886
A butterfly must'ave flapped it's wings.

300
00:24:29,015 --> 00:24:31,226
So, have you got to get up for work now, yeah?

301
00:24:32,769 --> 00:24:35,147
No. It's too early.

302
00:24:37,190 --> 00:24:38,650
I'm going back to bed.

303
00:24:51,956 --> 00:24:55,084
So is she a - a Buddhist or something, this nurse?

304
00:24:55,543 --> 00:24:57,462
No, she's a Catholic.

305
00:24:58,254 --> 00:25:00,423
What's she doin' with the old fat chap in the house, then?

306
00:25:00,715 --> 00:25:02,717
Dunno, I think she fancies him or somethin'.

307
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,137
Louise is a Catholic, did you know that?

308
00:25:06,262 --> 00:25:07,389
She's not, is she?

309
00:25:07,597 --> 00:25:09,474
Oh, fuckin' hell!

310
00:25:18,442 --> 00:25:20,944
You know what frightens me about the human body?

311
00:25:21,487 --> 00:25:22,112
What?

312
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:26,575
Well, it's like the most sophisticated mechanism in the entire universe,

313
00:25:26,909 --> 00:25:28,661
and yet it's so fuckin' quiet, in't it?

314
00:25:28,911 --> 00:25:29,829
know what I mean?

315
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:33,207
Dunno... Mine makes enough noise.

316
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:36,627
It's like this wet, pink factory.

317
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,922
What the fuck are they makin' in there? I mean what's the product?

318
00:25:39,172 --> 00:25:41,966
You never see no delivery trucks comin' or goin', do you?

319
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,762
I could've been a doctor.

320
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:47,305
D'you wanna examine me?

321
00:25:48,056 --> 00:25:49,182
You don't believe me, do you?

322
00:25:49,349 --> 00:25:51,143
I believe everything you say.

323
00:25:51,268 --> 00:25:52,519
I've got A-level Psychology.

324
00:25:52,769 --> 00:25:53,520
You 'aven't!

325
00:25:56,315 --> 00:25:57,941
"Resolve is never stronger

326
00:25:58,066 --> 00:26:00,152
than in the morning after the night it was never weaker".

327
00:26:00,319 --> 00:26:01,403
What d'you think of that?

328
00:26:01,445 --> 00:26:02,738
It's a load of bollocks.

329
00:26:04,490 --> 00:26:05,741
I thought of that.

330
00:26:07,451 --> 00:26:08,703
D'you not agree with it?

331
00:26:09,745 --> 00:26:10,705
Dunno

332
00:26:10,830 --> 00:26:13,124
Yeah, well, that's 'cos you weren't fuckin' listening, were you?

333
00:26:13,916 --> 00:26:16,419
What's this? A test or somethin'?

334
00:26:30,142 --> 00:26:31,310
Don't! Stop it!

335
00:26:32,144 --> 00:26:33,687
Just pack it in! Stop it!

336
00:26:34,855 --> 00:26:36,294
Stop buggering about!

337
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:41,487
You could get me a watch, Johnny

338
00:26:41,612 --> 00:26:43,239
Will you just keep still?!

339
00:26:43,405 --> 00:26:44,407
Look, you could get me a watch

340
00:26:44,532 --> 00:26:45,950
I'm not gonna get you a watch - you don't want a fuckin' watch!!

341
00:26:58,254 --> 00:27:00,006
I really like you, Johnny.

342
00:27:02,092 --> 00:27:03,426
You don't know me.

343
00:27:04,845 --> 00:27:06,346
I think I do.

344
00:27:07,055 --> 00:27:08,306
You don't fuckin' -

345
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:09,850
- ..know me!
- Oh, shit!

346
00:27:11,894 --> 00:27:13,645
- D'you still like me?
- I love you.

347
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:15,439
- What?
- I'm in love with you, Johnny.

348
00:27:16,065 --> 00:27:17,650
Don't laught - I'm serious, uh!

349
00:27:26,951 --> 00:27:29,537
I understand you Johnny, I do.

350
00:27:52,978 --> 00:27:54,605
Ta-ra, Mr. Halpern.

351
00:28:29,057 --> 00:28:30,100
What's the matter? What's going on?

352
00:28:31,018 --> 00:28:32,352
Fucked if I know.

353
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:44,615
I'm too old for all this.

354
00:28:46,743 --> 00:28:49,287
Why don't we go out ?
Go for a drink or somethin'?

355
00:28:50,288 --> 00:28:52,332
Why don't you fuckin' go out?
Go for a drink or somethin'?

356
00:28:52,624 --> 00:28:54,042
'Cos I wanna go with you!

357
00:28:55,752 --> 00:28:57,212
Is this good?

358
00:29:04,886 --> 00:29:07,639
What are you doin'?
Where are you goin'?

359
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:08,786
I'm cold!

360
00:29:08,838 --> 00:29:10,559
- Johnny, I just -
- Fuck off!

361
00:29:20,215 --> 00:29:22,905
Fuckin' hell! D'you ever get the feelin' that you're bein' followed?

362
00:29:24,449 --> 00:29:26,701
Look, will you just leave me alone - give me a bit of room or somethin'?

363
00:29:51,977 --> 00:29:53,521
Fuckin' hell!

364
00:30:00,444 --> 00:30:02,697
What's all that about? What you're playing at?

365
00:30:07,368 --> 00:30:09,037
- Where are you going, Johnny?
- Off my head.

366
00:30:09,162 --> 00:30:10,455
- I'm comin' with you.
- No, you're not.

367
00:30:10,622 --> 00:30:12,707
- I wanna come with you!
- I don't want to you fuckin' come with me!

368
00:30:15,001 --> 00:30:16,169
Are you coming back?

369
00:30:16,294 --> 00:30:17,462
What the fuck for?

370
00:31:11,727 --> 00:31:13,187
Maggie !

371
00:31:24,991 --> 00:31:26,117
Maggie !

372
00:31:29,579 --> 00:31:30,705
You all right there, chief?

373
00:31:37,337 --> 00:31:38,630
'Ave you lost somebody?

374
00:31:39,673 --> 00:31:41,383
Are you looking for somebody?

375
00:31:42,092 --> 00:31:43,719
Fuck off, cunt!!

376
00:31:55,565 --> 00:31:56,607
Got a fag?

377
00:31:56,691 --> 00:31:58,203
- Yes, thanks.
- Uh?

378
00:31:58,234 --> 00:31:59,610
- Yes, I've got one.
- Giz one.

379
00:32:00,278 --> 00:32:01,550
- Please.
- Wha'?

380
00:32:01,613 --> 00:32:02,780
Say please.

381
00:32:02,947 --> 00:32:04,491
Just fuckin' giz one. Come on, mister!

382
00:32:05,241 --> 00:32:07,494
You've got a lovely way about you - 'as anybody ever told you that?

383
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:10,705
'Thank you. That's all right.'

384
00:32:22,134 --> 00:32:23,427
Maggie !

385
00:32:24,094 --> 00:32:25,137
She's gone, mate!

386
00:32:26,263 --> 00:32:27,515
Those days are over.

387
00:32:28,974 --> 00:32:30,643
Have you seen a lassie wanderin' aboot here?

388
00:32:31,894 --> 00:32:32,853
What?

389
00:32:33,145 --> 00:32:35,273
A lassie. Black hair, blue jeans.

390
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:38,735
I saw a little Border collie padding off down there towards a fire.

391
00:32:38,776 --> 00:32:39,319
Where?

392
00:32:41,613 --> 00:32:43,114
'Ave you lost your bird or somethin'?

393
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,700
Aye. Have you've seen her? Black hair?

394
00:32:46,597 --> 00:32:49,830
- No
- Fuckin' hell! Stupid fuckin' cunt's gone

395
00:32:49,996 --> 00:32:51,039
and got lost.

396
00:32:51,832 --> 00:32:53,604
- You're from Scotland?
- Uh?

397
00:32:53,959 --> 00:32:55,377
- Are you scots?
- Aye.

398
00:32:55,669 --> 00:32:56,670
What's it like up there?

399
00:32:56,795 --> 00:32:59,298
Fuckin' shite! I'll kick her fanny in.

400
00:33:00,174 --> 00:33:02,509
- D'you dream in Scotch?
- Uh?

401
00:33:02,968 --> 00:33:04,929
Like, dream about sporran-clad, caber-tossin'

402
00:33:05,095 --> 00:33:07,390
haggis, gallopin' over porridge-covered glens?

403
00:33:07,556 --> 00:33:08,933
Talking shite.

404
00:33:09,225 --> 00:33:12,937
Yeah, well, I sent off for one of those Linguaphone packages, 'Talk Shite in a Fortnight' -

405
00:33:13,187 --> 00:33:15,606
't's all goin' very well. I haven't quite got the hang of the transitive verbs yet, but -

406
00:33:16,024 --> 00:33:17,734
Will you fuckin' shut it, eh?!

407
00:33:23,531 --> 00:33:25,158
- What you're doing down here?
- Eh?

408
00:33:26,034 --> 00:33:28,537
Why are you here in London, O Bodhidharma?

409
00:33:29,788 --> 00:33:31,206
Put my old man in hospital.

410
00:33:31,581 --> 00:33:32,207
- Your dad?
- Ah.

411
00:33:33,333 --> 00:33:36,170
- 'Ow did you do that, then?
- Cracked 'im on the nut wi' a poker.

412
00:33:36,201 --> 00:33:38,756
- What for?
- 'E was fuckin' asking for it!

413
00:33:40,132 --> 00:33:41,300
So what, is 'e in a bad way?

414
00:33:42,009 --> 00:33:43,385
Fuckin' right. He's 'alf dead.

415
00:33:43,969 --> 00:33:45,179
What does you mam think about it?

416
00:33:45,221 --> 00:33:46,681
She's off 'er fuckin' nut.

417
00:33:47,515 --> 00:33:48,766
So you're like on the run, yeah?

418
00:33:49,684 --> 00:33:50,518
- Aye.
- Yeah, me too.

419
00:33:50,601 --> 00:33:52,478
Yeah? The cops after you? Yeah?

420
00:33:53,354 --> 00:33:55,732
- Can you tell me something', Jock.
- Uh?

421
00:33:56,357 --> 00:33:57,400
What's all that about?

422
00:33:59,611 --> 00:34:02,947
That. The old Highland fling, there. D'you know you're doing that?

423
00:34:03,219 --> 00:34:05,951
- What?
- That, you know - 'And now for my next tic...'. That.

424
00:34:06,493 --> 00:34:08,370
Look, it, it just happened again - I'm not imaginin' it.

425
00:34:08,495 --> 00:34:09,621
Fuck off, eh?

426
00:34:10,163 --> 00:34:12,499
D'you do that in a sack with the old tic, spit, 'Eh, Maggie!'?

427
00:34:12,749 --> 00:34:13,959
You must be a great fuckin' shag.

428
00:34:14,084 --> 00:34:15,043
You takin' the piss?!

429
00:34:15,127 --> 00:34:16,211
You're fuckin' givin' it away, aren't yer?

430
00:34:16,295 --> 00:34:19,840
Fuckin' come on, cunt! Kick your fucking' head open!!

431
00:34:20,883 --> 00:34:22,343
What's it like being you?

432
00:34:23,385 --> 00:34:24,553
Bit hectic?

433
00:34:24,637 --> 00:34:26,347
Fuck off, poof!

434
00:34:29,475 --> 00:34:31,644
Do you believe in self-fulfillin' prophecies?

435
00:34:34,522 --> 00:34:35,940
You know, like, Nostradamus?

436
00:34:37,817 --> 00:34:40,320
'E was like this sixteenth-century astrologer.

437
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,407
An''e wrote in one of 'is quatrains that this goon called Hister would invade Poland.

438
00:34:44,574 --> 00:34:46,535
So Hitler reads it, and thinks 'Hister: Hitler. Must mean me',

439
00:34:46,701 --> 00:34:48,412
and invades Poland.

440
00:34:48,578 --> 00:34:51,874
So when the guy prophesied that the world would end in 1999, which 'e did,

441
00:34:52,416 --> 00:34:54,710
does that therefore mean that we're fulfilling the prophecy

442
00:34:55,002 --> 00:34:56,503
by precipitatin' the Apocalypse?

443
00:34:56,629 --> 00:34:57,338
Are you with me?

444
00:34:58,422 --> 00:35:00,966
Do you think the world will end in 1999?

445
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:05,221
Listen, mate, what d'you think to this?

446
00:35:05,638 --> 00:35:08,599
Why don't you 'ave a little wander round and go look for the wee lassie, an' I'll wait 'ere?

447
00:35:08,808 --> 00:35:11,811
And if she turns up, I'll keep 'er 'ere till you get back?
'Ow does that grab you?

448
00:35:11,936 --> 00:35:13,021
Are you're gonna be here, aye?

449
00:35:13,605 --> 00:35:16,900
Right. If she gets back, right, tell her to fuckin' wait here till I get back.

450
00:35:17,692 --> 00:35:20,153
If she wanders off, knock her oot. And slap her gob for me, right?

451
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:21,488
- Yeah, I'll tie her up.
- Aye.

452
00:35:22,614 --> 00:35:23,657
- You're gonna be here, aye?
- Yeah.

453
00:35:23,907 --> 00:35:25,117
Oh, listen, what's her name again?

454
00:35:25,409 --> 00:35:26,702
Maggie.

455
00:35:26,702 --> 00:35:28,996
- Oh, yeah.
- Will back in a minute, right?

456
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:46,639
Excuse me, love.

457
00:35:48,933 --> 00:35:49,976
Hallo?!

458
00:35:51,644 --> 00:35:52,478
Are you Maggie ?

459
00:35:53,229 --> 00:35:54,481
Piss off!

460
00:36:00,862 --> 00:36:03,156
- Oh, you're Maggie ?
- Wha' ?

461
00:36:03,156 --> 00:36:05,325
- Is your name Maggie ?
- How d'ye ken that?

462
00:36:05,534 --> 00:36:09,329
It's just a hunch. Are you looking for the petulant dwarf?

463
00:36:10,831 --> 00:36:11,790
Sprechen Sie Deutsch ?

464
00:36:11,832 --> 00:36:12,750
Archie !

465
00:36:13,042 --> 00:36:15,794
Yeah, that's the fella.
I was told to wait 'ere for you.

466
00:36:16,295 --> 00:36:19,548
You, Maggie, 'e's, Archie, I'm nobody -
'e's gone off looking for you, love.

467
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:20,591
What, you've seen 'um?

468
00:36:20,716 --> 00:36:22,426
Look, would you come and sit over 'ere, now?

469
00:36:22,760 --> 00:36:24,595
Fuck off, you dirty cunt!

470
00:36:25,430 --> 00:36:27,140
Yeah, well, I know I've not 'ad bath for a good few seasons,

471
00:36:27,265 --> 00:36:28,975
but there's no need to 'urt my feelin's.

472
00:36:29,225 --> 00:36:30,643
'E'll be back in a minute!

473
00:36:31,936 --> 00:36:33,188
What, he's been here?

474
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,232
He's been here. He's been there. He's been all over the fuckin' shop.

475
00:36:36,441 --> 00:36:37,776
And did 'e 'ave the chips wi' 'um?

476
00:36:37,901 --> 00:36:39,069
He had a huge one on 'is shoulder.

477
00:36:39,236 --> 00:36:40,112
Fuckin' wee radge!

478
00:36:40,403 --> 00:36:42,114
Oh, come now, there's no need to knock the young lad,

479
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,783
He's a wonderful exponent of the old Socratic debate.

480
00:36:49,788 --> 00:36:52,124
Listen love, I've got this great idea.

481
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:56,045
Why don't you 'ave a little wander round, see if you can find the wee lad, an' I wait 'ere.

482
00:36:56,712 --> 00:36:58,714
An' if 'e turns up, I'll keep 'im 'ere until you get back

483
00:36:59,090 --> 00:37:00,466
I'm fuckin' starvin'.

484
00:37:02,093 --> 00:37:03,136
D'you wanna get somethin' to eat?

485
00:37:03,261 --> 00:37:04,679
He's got all money, hasn't 'e?

486
00:37:04,721 --> 00:37:05,722
- Who? Laughing Boy?
- Aye.

487
00:37:07,849 --> 00:37:09,058
Well, I've got a few bob on me.

488
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,894
And what if he comes back when noone's here?

489
00:37:11,102 --> 00:37:11,978
We'll leave 'em a note

490
00:37:12,228 --> 00:37:13,563
He'll no be able to read it.

491
00:37:16,483 --> 00:37:18,527
Well, we'll get 'im on his bleeper - come on

492
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:34,418
Can you feel all those vibrations?

493
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:35,669
Wha'?

494
00:37:37,755 --> 00:37:40,758
Just stand still a minute, love. Try and feel it through your feet.

495
00:37:43,261 --> 00:37:46,306
D'you not get all those tremblin's and rumblin's comin' up through your bones?

496
00:37:46,598 --> 00:37:47,599
Not really, no.

497
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:52,479
D'you not get like a sense of, like, a whole other world underneath all this?

498
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,606
You know like the guts of London?

499
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:58,527
What with all the tube trains and everything, the city's viscera and the subterranean fuckin'

500
00:37:58,694 --> 00:38:01,363
fistulas and conduits and colons and bunkers

501
00:38:01,655 --> 00:38:03,115
and dungeons and tombs an' all that?

502
00:38:03,282 --> 00:38:05,284
What about Hell? And the sewers, like?

503
00:38:06,243 --> 00:38:09,496
- You know that wherever you are in London, you're only 30 feet away from a rat?
- Aye?

504
00:38:10,372 --> 00:38:11,373
- Does that freak you out?
- Nah.

505
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:14,919
- D'you believe in hell?
- Aye.

506
00:38:15,294 --> 00:38:17,380
- So, d'you believe in the devil?
- Aye.

507
00:38:17,713 --> 00:38:18,840
What d'you think 'e looks like?

508
00:38:19,090 --> 00:38:20,508
Looks like that, doesn' 'e?

509
00:38:21,551 --> 00:38:23,970
What, a little nudist homunculus with a pink quiff?

510
00:38:24,137 --> 00:38:25,305
No, 'e looks like a snake

511
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:26,473
Let's 'ave a look at that

512
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,434
It's Archie, isn't it?

513
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:30,727
It's my good-luck charm

514
00:38:31,061 --> 00:38:31,978
'As he brought you much?

515
00:38:32,062 --> 00:38:33,188
Has it fuck.

516
00:38:33,772 --> 00:38:35,023
- Are you superstituous?
- No

517
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,818
What d'you wear a good-luck charm for, then?

518
00:38:38,360 --> 00:38:40,070
Are we gonna get something to eat or what?

519
00:38:44,908 --> 00:38:46,285
Have you ever seen a dead body?

520
00:38:48,245 --> 00:38:49,330
Only me own.

521
00:38:56,295 --> 00:38:57,880
Where was you thinkin' to sleepin' tonight?

522
00:38:58,047 --> 00:38:58,840
Dunno.

523
00:38:59,590 --> 00:39:00,883
Where did you kip down last night?

524
00:39:01,050 --> 00:39:01,843
In the park.

525
00:39:02,427 --> 00:39:04,345
- Was that not cold?
- Aye.

526
00:39:05,638 --> 00:39:07,348
Where are you thinkin' of sleepin', like?

527
00:39:08,016 --> 00:39:09,184
Wherever I drop.

528
00:39:10,852 --> 00:39:11,853
'Ow old are you, love?

529
00:39:12,479 --> 00:39:13,355
Twenty-three

530
00:39:14,064 --> 00:39:15,440
- Do your mam and dad know you're down 'ere?
- No.

531
00:39:17,109 --> 00:39:18,360
- Will they not be worried about you?
- No

532
00:39:20,362 --> 00:39:21,613
How old are you, like?

533
00:39:22,698 --> 00:39:23,741
'Ow old d'you think I am?

534
00:39:24,742 --> 00:39:25,826
About forty.

535
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:28,621
I'm twenty-seven.

536
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:30,122
Oh, get to fuck!

537
00:39:38,214 --> 00:39:39,924
Where the fuck 'a you been?

538
00:39:40,174 --> 00:39:43,511
Where the fuck 'a you been?
I've been waitin' on yer!

539
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,075
- Fuck off!
- Cunt!

540
00:39:45,096 --> 00:39:46,306
Why the fuck you've been doin', eh?

541
00:39:46,473 --> 00:39:47,766
You've got all the money.

542
00:39:47,891 --> 00:39:49,142
I've been fuckin'g lookin' all over for yer.

543
00:39:49,267 --> 00:39:50,310
Aye, well, I was wi' him!

544
00:39:50,393 --> 00:39:51,895
- Were you fuck!
- I fuckin' was!

545
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,147
- I was fuckin' wi' him!
- I was fuckin' wi' him!

546
00:39:54,356 --> 00:39:55,357
Daft cunt!

547
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:57,067
- Fuckin' ask him!
- Fuck off!

548
00:39:57,276 --> 00:39:58,318
Fuckin' ask him!

549
00:39:58,443 --> 00:40:00,195
- Fuckin' daft bitch!
- Where's my chips?

550
00:40:00,863 --> 00:40:02,656
That was fuckin' years ago.

551
00:40:02,698 --> 00:40:03,699
Aye, well, I was starvin' wasn't I?

552
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,035
- I'll fuckin' gi' yer fuckin' chips!
- Fuck off!

553
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,161
- Fuckin' leave us alone!

554
00:40:07,390 --> 00:40:08,746
- Kick your fuckin' cunt

555
00:40:54,335 --> 00:40:55,461
Did he 'urt you?

556
00:40:58,298 --> 00:40:59,424
What d'you mean?

557
00:41:00,300 --> 00:41:02,969
You know, when you were fuckin'?

558
00:41:03,928 --> 00:41:05,555
Why? Did he 'urt you?

559
00:41:09,976 --> 00:41:12,688
D'you thing you were made for each other?

560
00:41:13,355 --> 00:41:15,274
Well, we went out for a year.

561
00:41:15,482 --> 00:41:18,944
A year?! Fuckin''ell - gimme a year!

562
00:41:22,656 --> 00:41:24,784
D'you ever feel like topping yourself?

563
00:41:27,203 --> 00:41:29,622
Oh, God! I wish I was at 'ome

564
00:41:30,206 --> 00:41:31,124
Glad I'm not.

565
00:41:31,374 --> 00:41:34,877
Yeah, well, I don't mean with me mum and dad.
I just mean in Manchester.

566
00:41:35,503 --> 00:41:37,422
Oh, you reckon it's different there, do you?

567
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:40,216
- Yeah - people talk to you.
- Well, I'm talkin' to you.

568
00:41:40,425 --> 00:41:42,177
Yeah, but you talk a pile of shit.

569
00:41:44,471 --> 00:41:45,972
Don't matter where are you, anyway.

570
00:41:46,097 --> 00:41:48,767
You might as well be in Zimbabwe with Sandra.

571
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:54,064
Are you gonna do any washin' up before she gets back?

572
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:57,192
Yeah, course I am.
When is she gettin' back?

573
00:41:58,652 --> 00:41:59,695
Sunday.

574
00:42:01,155 --> 00:42:03,199
Well, that's four fuckin' days away, innit?

575
00:42:14,210 --> 00:42:17,046
"Thou shalt not consent unto Him,
nor harken unto Him."

576
00:42:17,213 --> 00:42:19,632
"Neither shall thine eye pity Him,
neither shalt thou spare",

577
00:42:19,716 --> 00:42:22,969
"neither shalt thou conceal 'Im.
But thou shalt surely kill 'Im. Thy ha..."

578
00:42:37,693 --> 00:42:38,861
Lost me place now.

579
00:42:41,530 --> 00:42:43,741
"And thou shalt stone 'Im with stones, that He die

580
00:42:44,033 --> 00:42:46,869
because He hath sought to thrust thee away from the Lord thy God. And -"

581
00:42:47,870 --> 00:42:50,540
Oh, fuckin' 'ell! Why 'ast though forsaken me? Bastard!"

582
00:43:16,609 --> 00:43:20,446
Is that it now, then? Are you through with the regulation pacin'?

583
00:43:20,738 --> 00:43:22,740
You're all set to deploy the fatuous sarcasm?

584
00:43:22,949 --> 00:43:24,867
Well, I've beaten you to it.

585
00:43:24,992 --> 00:43:26,035
Would you like a mint?

586
00:43:27,286 --> 00:43:29,789
Oh, what's this, new policy?
Ply the culprit with menthol?

587
00:43:30,081 --> 00:43:31,666
Extra strong.

588
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:36,963
I get four packets of these a night

589
00:43:37,339 --> 00:43:40,091
You want be careful, don't yer? I don't want your poxy mint.

590
00:43:42,719 --> 00:43:44,179
Oh? Waste not, want not.

591
00:43:44,596 --> 00:43:46,098
And other cliches.

592
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:49,143
Ah - but a cliche is full of truth, otherwise it wouldn't be a cliche.

593
00:43:49,351 --> 00:43:50,978
Which is in itself a cliche.

594
00:43:53,981 --> 00:43:55,649
Tell me, have you

595
00:43:55,941 --> 00:43:56,650
read the book of Hosea?

596
00:43:56,817 --> 00:43:57,485
What now?

597
00:43:57,693 --> 00:43:59,445
"For they are the children of whores".

598
00:43:59,737 --> 00:44:01,113
There's no need to get personal, mate.

599
00:44:02,490 --> 00:44:03,574
Look, will you stop fucking about?

600
00:44:03,783 --> 00:44:05,368
If you're gonna stick the boot in, will you get on with it?

601
00:44:19,966 --> 00:44:21,176
Have you got nowhere to go, then?

602
00:44:21,677 --> 00:44:23,345
Yeah, I've got an infinite number of fuckin' places to go.

603
00:44:23,470 --> 00:44:25,222
The problem is, where you stay.

604
00:44:25,430 --> 00:44:26,348
Are you with me?

605
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,267
Indeed. Yes.

606
00:44:29,852 --> 00:44:31,061
So listen, is there much security

607
00:44:31,186 --> 00:44:31,979
in this job?

608
00:44:32,855 --> 00:44:33,606
Too much.

609
00:44:38,736 --> 00:44:42,115
And what is it what goes on in this particular postmodernist gas chamber?

610
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:46,869
Nothing. It's empty.

611
00:44:47,620 --> 00:44:49,080
So what is it that you're guardin'?

612
00:44:50,874 --> 00:44:51,791
Space.

613
00:44:54,127 --> 00:44:55,420
You're guarding space?

614
00:44:56,630 --> 00:45:00,092
That's stupid, innit? Because someone could break in there, right, and steal all the fuckin' space,

615
00:45:00,217 --> 00:45:01,551
and you wouldn't know it 'ad gone, would you?

616
00:45:03,512 --> 00:45:04,721
Good point.

617
00:45:08,267 --> 00:45:09,101
Night-night.

618
00:45:52,271 --> 00:45:56,567
Yeah, all right, pal. I appreciate you've got a job to do,
an' it's "Move on! Move on! Move on!"

619
00:45:56,776 --> 00:45:58,569
But it's fuckin' freezin' out there, an' I was a Caesarian.

620
00:45:58,694 --> 00:45:59,612
Come on, quick!

621
00:45:59,946 --> 00:46:01,698
- What?
- Come in.

622
00:46:06,369 --> 00:46:07,245
Are you serious?

623
00:46:07,412 --> 00:46:08,955
Through that door... smartish.

624
00:46:15,962 --> 00:46:16,922
It's a funny smell in 'ere.

625
00:46:17,965 --> 00:46:19,132
Come on.

626
00:46:23,721 --> 00:46:25,472
A bit of waste of space, all this, in't it?

627
00:46:26,307 --> 00:46:28,767
You could sleep a thousand flea-bitten tramps in 'ere.

628
00:46:29,602 --> 00:46:30,916
And what's all that?

629
00:46:31,437 --> 00:46:33,397
You know, they say it's a fuckin' jungle out there? 'Ave you seen it in 'ere?

630
00:46:34,023 --> 00:46:35,233
I mean, where's the bloody monkeys?

631
00:46:36,234 --> 00:46:39,404
Look, Dad, will you just back off?!
What is it you're after?

632
00:46:39,779 --> 00:46:41,656
- You must be invisible.
- What?

633
00:46:41,990 --> 00:46:43,783
I must be seen.

634
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,243
Follow me.

635
00:46:58,966 --> 00:47:00,008
Sit here.

636
00:47:02,511 --> 00:47:03,887
Am I allowed to smoke in here?

637
00:47:04,096 --> 00:47:06,140
No. You'll set off the alarm.

638
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:08,851
Now, I'm not gonna look at you.

639
00:47:10,311 --> 00:47:13,356
It mustn't look like I'm talking to anybody.

640
00:47:13,773 --> 00:47:15,525
If you're seen in here, I'm out of a job.

641
00:47:16,609 --> 00:47:17,944
See what I mean?

642
00:47:18,361 --> 00:47:20,572
Well, if they see you talking to yourself like that, you'll be out of a job anyway.

643
00:47:20,947 --> 00:47:22,407
They'll come after you with a big butterfly net.

644
00:47:25,618 --> 00:47:27,287
Oh, yes.. I'll stand like this, then.

645
00:47:29,331 --> 00:47:30,165
Well, that's better, isn't it?

646
00:47:30,540 --> 00:47:31,166
What?

647
00:47:31,708 --> 00:47:33,210
In out of the cold?

648
00:47:37,548 --> 00:47:38,924
Yeah. Yeah - thanks very much.

649
00:47:42,970 --> 00:47:44,680
It's funny bein' inside, in't it?

650
00:47:45,681 --> 00:47:48,934
'Cos when you are inside, you're still actually outside, aren't you?

651
00:47:49,518 --> 00:47:51,479
And then you can say when you're outside, you're inside,

652
00:47:51,604 --> 00:47:53,439
because you're always inside your head.

653
00:47:54,148 --> 00:47:54,857
D'you follow that?

654
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:57,277
Yes. Sometimes when I'm sitting here, I turn the lights off -

655
00:47:57,360 --> 00:47:58,486
sit in the dark.

656
00:47:59,571 --> 00:48:00,613
That always makes me feel like I'm sitting

657
00:48:00,780 --> 00:48:01,698
outside.

658
00:48:02,532 --> 00:48:04,034
So what d'you do with you self here of a night-time?

659
00:48:04,909 --> 00:48:06,870
I read. And I think.

660
00:48:07,746 --> 00:48:08,997
What do you think about?

661
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,041
I think about my life.

662
00:48:11,416 --> 00:48:13,835
- And is that horrendous for you?
- No! Certainly not!

663
00:48:14,253 --> 00:48:15,295
Is it horrendous for your wife?

664
00:48:15,921 --> 00:48:16,964
Are you married, mate?

665
00:48:18,841 --> 00:48:20,426
Well, technically I'm married.

666
00:48:20,801 --> 00:48:23,012
Although my wife is 5,919 miles away,

667
00:48:23,304 --> 00:48:24,764
and I haven't seen her for thirteen years.

668
00:48:25,222 --> 00:48:27,433
It's all going very well then. Where is she?

669
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,601
She's in Bangkok.

670
00:48:28,935 --> 00:48:29,894
Saucy!

671
00:48:34,107 --> 00:48:36,818
- They're not worth it, are they?
- Whores and harlots.

672
00:48:38,987 --> 00:48:40,530
When was the last time you 'ad a fuck?

673
00:48:43,450 --> 00:48:45,118
Is that an embarassin' question for you?

674
00:48:45,869 --> 00:48:47,162
It is rather - yes.

675
00:48:48,455 --> 00:48:49,498
I'm sorry.

676
00:48:52,459 --> 00:48:53,585
Step this way.

677
00:48:54,711 --> 00:48:57,214
I want to reveal to you the mysteries of my trade.

678
00:49:01,510 --> 00:49:02,803
What d'you think that is?

679
00:49:03,137 --> 00:49:04,847
A Dadaist nun?

680
00:49:04,972 --> 00:49:08,768
Wrong. This little lady is the representative of my employer.

681
00:49:08,935 --> 00:49:09,644
How d'you do, love?

682
00:49:09,644 --> 00:49:10,478
Watch.

683
00:49:13,690 --> 00:49:14,774
Very Zen.

684
00:49:15,275 --> 00:49:19,738
My existence at this moment on this spot is now trapped and recorded.

685
00:49:20,697 --> 00:49:23,575
23 moments, 23 sites, every two hours.

686
00:49:24,493 --> 00:49:25,744
That's my job.

687
00:49:26,828 --> 00:49:29,498
Well, could they not train a tall chimpanzee to do that?

688
00:49:29,748 --> 00:49:32,251
Or, a small chimpanzee with a bigger gizmo?

689
00:49:33,335 --> 00:49:35,045
I suppose they could, yes.

690
00:49:35,587 --> 00:49:36,588
What's your name, son?

691
00:49:37,256 --> 00:49:39,842
- Brian.
- Hallo Brian - Johnny.

692
00:49:40,134 --> 00:49:43,679
Well, Brian, congratulations, you've succeeded in convincin' me

693
00:49:43,804 --> 00:49:47,266
that you do 'ave the most tedious fuckin' job in England.

694
00:49:50,478 --> 00:49:50,916
Come on.

695
00:50:01,844 --> 00:50:05,786
- Yes! It is a boring job! Bloody boring, actually.
- All right! All right!

696
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:07,537
But all you can see is the tip of the iceberg.

697
00:50:07,663 --> 00:50:09,623
The present. The tedious here and now.

698
00:50:09,915 --> 00:50:13,794
What you're not capable of seeing is the rest of time - the rest of the iceberg.

699
00:50:14,003 --> 00:50:15,754
The past and the future.

700
00:50:15,879 --> 00:50:18,674
My future. Which is a very interesting place to be.

701
00:50:19,383 --> 00:50:21,635
And the good thing about this job is that it gives me time and space

702
00:50:21,761 --> 00:50:23,387
to contemplate the future at my leisure.

703
00:50:23,804 --> 00:50:25,139
Whilst the city sleeps.

704
00:50:25,306 --> 00:50:27,934
Free from cacophonous curiosity of the hoi polloi.

705
00:50:29,143 --> 00:50:31,229
So you see, it's not a boring job.

706
00:50:33,064 --> 00:50:34,524
And I'm not boring, either.

707
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,985
Am I allowed to smoke on the stairs?

708
00:50:37,235 --> 00:50:38,945
No. There's alarms all over the building.

709
00:50:40,822 --> 00:50:43,992
So you think you can make the present palatable by projectin' into the future?

710
00:50:44,117 --> 00:50:47,329
You're living in the past, pal. It's the future that fucks you up, Brian.

711
00:50:47,538 --> 00:50:49,498
It's the maggot in the apple.

712
00:50:50,332 --> 00:50:53,669
See, you're all pissed off with the present, Bri, and there's nothing wrong with the present.

713
00:50:54,044 --> 00:50:56,422
The present's fine. The present's perfect.

714
00:50:56,547 --> 00:50:57,882
The present's peachy-fuckin'-creamy.

715
00:50:58,174 --> 00:51:01,385
The only thing wrong with the present is the bastard doesn't exist,

716
00:51:01,510 --> 00:51:04,430
Because the present is the future, and the future is the past.

717
00:51:04,639 --> 00:51:06,557
And it's all the same fuckin' bag of bones anyway.

718
00:51:06,808 --> 00:51:10,687
It's a constant process of comin' into bein' and passin' away, comin' into bein' and passin' away.

719
00:51:10,937 --> 00:51:12,272
The future is now.

720
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:14,441
But the present does exist. We're in it, now.

721
00:51:14,816 --> 00:51:18,695
You were just then when you said it, but you're not in it now, you're not in it now, you're not in it now. You're forever being kicked up

722
00:51:19,029 --> 00:51:20,655
the arse by the future. Are you with me?

723
00:51:21,114 --> 00:51:24,368
That's what I mean. See, I'm in the present.

724
00:51:24,493 --> 00:51:26,954
But I'm not in the present. I'm in the future.

725
00:51:29,039 --> 00:51:30,124
Exactly.

726
00:51:31,041 --> 00:51:32,293
Has nobody not told you, Brian,

727
00:51:32,418 --> 00:51:35,087
that you've got this kind of gleeful preoccupation with the future?

728
00:51:35,254 --> 00:51:37,256
I wouldn't even mind, but you don't even 'ave a fuckin' future.

729
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:41,010
I don't 'ave a future. Nobody 'as a future. The party's is over.

730
00:51:41,135 --> 00:51:43,179
Take a look around you, man. It's all breaking up.

731
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:46,307
Are you not familiar with the book of Revelation of St John,

732
00:51:46,516 --> 00:51:48,434
the final book of the Bible, prophesying the Apocalypse?

733
00:51:48,643 --> 00:51:50,687
Yes. As it happens, I'm familiar with all the books of the Bible.

734
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:51,980
I'm very happy for you

735
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:56,276
"He forced everyone to receive a mark on his right hand, or on his forehead,

736
00:51:56,568 --> 00:51:58,612
so that no one shall be able to buy or sell,

737
00:51:58,737 --> 00:52:00,906
unless he has the mark, which is the name of the beast.

738
00:52:01,156 --> 00:52:03,784
Or the number of his name; and the number of the beast is six-six-six.

739
00:52:04,159 --> 00:52:05,160
- Six-six-six. I know about it
- Great!

740
00:52:05,577 --> 00:52:08,664
I know about Nostradamus.
Nostradamus talked about three brothers.

741
00:52:09,581 --> 00:52:12,668
Now, did he mean the Kennedy brothers, or was he talking about three bits of the Soviet Union?

742
00:52:13,711 --> 00:52:15,171
You see, you just can't tell.

743
00:52:15,337 --> 00:52:17,673
Fuck Nostradamus! I'm not talking about Nostradamus

744
00:52:17,798 --> 00:52:19,967
or Mother Shipton or Russell Grant of Mystic fuckin' Meg -

745
00:52:20,092 --> 00:52:21,969
I'm talking about a Holy fuckin' Book!

746
00:52:23,221 --> 00:52:26,182
What can such a specific prophecy mean?

747
00:52:26,808 --> 00:52:28,184
What is the mark?

748
00:52:29,352 --> 00:52:31,604
Well the mark, Brian, is the bar code,

749
00:52:31,813 --> 00:52:35,567
the ubiquitous barcode that you'll find on every bog-roll, on every packet of johnnies,

750
00:52:35,775 --> 00:52:37,152
and every poxy pork pie.

751
00:52:37,444 --> 00:52:41,073
And every fuckin' bar code is divided into two parts by three markers.

752
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:44,409
And those three markers are always represented by the number six.

753
00:52:44,576 --> 00:52:46,704
Six. Six. Six!

754
00:52:47,037 --> 00:52:49,415
Now what does it say? "No one shall be able to buy,

755
00:52:49,665 --> 00:52:51,500
or sell, without that mark."

756
00:52:52,126 --> 00:52:55,963
And now, what they're plannin' to do in order to eradicate all credit-card fraud,

757
00:52:56,297 --> 00:52:58,966
and in order to precipitate a totally cashless society,

758
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,844
what they're plannin' to do, what they've already tested on the American troops,

759
00:53:02,053 --> 00:53:04,681
they're going to subcutaneously laser-tattoo that mark

760
00:53:04,973 --> 00:53:06,766
on to your right hand or on to your forehead.

761
00:53:06,933 --> 00:53:09,728
They're going to replace plastic with flesh. Fact!

762
00:53:10,645 --> 00:53:14,337
In the same book of Revelation, when the seven seals are broken open on the Day of Judgement,

763
00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:18,111
and the seven angels blow the trumpets, when the third angel blows 'er bugle,

764
00:53:18,445 --> 00:53:20,614
"Wormwood will fall from the sky.

765
00:53:20,822 --> 00:53:22,658
Wormwood will poison a third part of all the waters,

766
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:26,620
and a third part of all the land, and many, many, many, people will die."

767
00:53:26,870 --> 00:53:29,957
Now, d'you know what the Russian translation for "wormwood" is?

768
00:53:30,666 --> 00:53:32,168
- No
- Chernobyl.

769
00:53:32,626 --> 00:53:33,502
Fact!

770
00:53:34,295 --> 00:53:36,672
On August the 18th, 1999,

771
00:53:36,964 --> 00:53:40,426
the planets of our solar system are going to line up into the shape of a cross.

772
00:53:40,510 --> 00:53:41,427
I don't believe in astrology.

773
00:53:41,594 --> 00:53:44,097
I'm not talking about astrology. I'm talking about astromony.

774
00:53:44,722 --> 00:53:48,101
They're going to line up in the fixed signs of Aquarius, Leo, Taurus,

775
00:53:48,351 --> 00:53:52,522
and Scorpio, which just happen to correspond with the four beasts of the Apocalypse,

776
00:53:52,772 --> 00:53:54,107
as mentioned in the Book of Daniel.

777
00:53:54,316 --> 00:53:57,235
Another fuckin' fact! D'you want me to go on?

778
00:53:57,653 --> 00:54:00,989
The end of the world is nigh, Bri. The game is up!

779
00:54:03,409 --> 00:54:04,451
I don't believe that.

780
00:54:05,911 --> 00:54:07,580
Life can't just come to a stop.

781
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:16,714
All right, I'm not sayin' that life will end, or the world will end,

782
00:54:16,923 --> 00:54:19,008
or the universe will cease to exist.

783
00:54:19,217 --> 00:54:21,010
But Man will cease to exist.

784
00:54:21,302 --> 00:54:24,514
Just like the dinosaurs passed into extinction, the same thing'll happen to us.

785
00:54:24,889 --> 00:54:28,101
We're not fuckin' important. We're just a crap idea!

786
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,978
I'm not gonna cease to exist.

787
00:54:31,021 --> 00:54:32,314
I'm gonna be here in the future.

788
00:54:33,815 --> 00:54:36,235
What is this fuckin' fixation with the future?!

789
00:54:37,027 --> 00:54:39,863
Listen pal, I've got chronic systolic palpitations

790
00:54:40,072 --> 00:54:41,615
and acute fuckin' neuralgia!

791
00:54:42,032 --> 00:54:43,576
What about these toilets - can I smoke in 'ere?

792
00:54:43,742 --> 00:54:44,827
No, you fuckin' can't!

793
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:47,830
Let me ask you a question.

794
00:54:48,706 --> 00:54:51,000
Have you ever had the sense that you've lived in a time different from this one?

795
00:54:51,250 --> 00:54:53,377
- What you mean like in a past life?
- Could be, yeah.

796
00:54:53,669 --> 00:54:54,962
Yeah, well, in my past life I was dead.

797
00:54:55,088 --> 00:54:56,381
Ah, well, you see - I wasn't.

798
00:54:56,547 --> 00:54:59,175
I know I was here in the past, before I was born.

799
00:54:59,759 --> 00:55:01,886
So I know I'm gonna be here in the future after I've died.

800
00:55:02,262 --> 00:55:02,929
I see.

801
00:55:03,471 --> 00:55:05,181
And in this alternative existence,

802
00:55:05,348 --> 00:55:07,309
did you still 'ave the same noxious body odour?

803
00:55:07,976 --> 00:55:10,520
There's no need to be personal. It's what I believe.

804
00:55:10,645 --> 00:55:11,772
Shall I tell you what I believe?

805
00:55:11,855 --> 00:55:12,689
You don't believe anything.

806
00:55:12,814 --> 00:55:13,690
Oh, I do, Brian.

807
00:55:13,815 --> 00:55:14,983
Yeah? What do you believe?

808
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:18,695
Do you think the amoeba ever dreamed that it would evolve into the frog?

809
00:55:19,947 --> 00:55:20,990
Of course it didn't.

810
00:55:21,657 --> 00:55:24,994
And when that first frog shimmied out of the water and employed it's vocal chords

811
00:55:25,161 --> 00:55:27,788
in order to attract a mate or to retard a predator,

812
00:55:28,122 --> 00:55:31,042
do you think that that frog ever imagined that that incipient croak would evolve into

813
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:32,835
all the languages of the world,

814
00:55:33,002 --> 00:55:34,087
into all the literature of the world?

815
00:55:34,295 --> 00:55:35,588
'Course it fuckin' didn't.

816
00:55:36,130 --> 00:55:40,009
And just as that froggy could never have possibly conceived of - of Shakespeare,

817
00:55:40,218 --> 00:55:42,721
we can never possibly imagine our destiny.

818
00:55:43,513 --> 00:55:45,181
I know what my destiny is.

819
00:55:45,682 --> 00:55:49,936
Yeah but what you're experiencing, as far as I can gather what with all these manifestations of

820
00:55:50,479 --> 00:55:52,147
regression and precognition

821
00:55:52,356 --> 00:55:54,942
and transmigratory astral fuckin' chatterin's,

822
00:55:55,234 --> 00:55:58,487
is just the equivalent of that first primeval grunt.

823
00:55:58,737 --> 00:56:00,573
Because evolution isn't over.

824
00:56:00,990 --> 00:56:03,784
Man isn't the fuckin' be-all and fuckin' end-all.

825
00:56:05,828 --> 00:56:09,207
Look. If you take the whole of time represented by one year,

826
00:56:09,415 --> 00:56:11,918
we're only in the first few moments of the 1st of January.

827
00:56:12,168 --> 00:56:13,628
There's a long way to go.

828
00:56:14,087 --> 00:56:16,714
Only now we're not going to sprout extra limbs and wings and fins

829
00:56:16,923 --> 00:56:19,134
because evolution itself is evolving.

830
00:56:19,384 --> 00:56:23,305
And whereas you, through some process of extra-sensory recall,

831
00:56:23,471 --> 00:56:25,015
might imagine that you were some -

832
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:28,643
I dunno, some 17th century little Dutch girl livin' in a windmill in Old Amsterdam,

833
00:56:28,769 --> 00:56:31,647
one day you'll realize that you've had not just one or two

834
00:56:31,813 --> 00:56:33,398
past or future existences,

835
00:56:33,816 --> 00:56:37,111
but that you were, and are, everybody and everything that 'as ever been,

836
00:56:37,277 --> 00:56:38,862
or will ever be.

837
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,700
Hang on a minute. You've just contradicted yourself.

838
00:56:42,908 --> 00:56:43,868
Oh, and 'ow'd you make that out?

839
00:56:44,035 --> 00:56:45,912
Downstairs you were predicting the end of the world.

840
00:56:46,078 --> 00:56:47,205
Now you're talking about the future.

841
00:56:48,039 --> 00:56:48,956
How do you explain that, eh?

842
00:56:49,290 --> 00:56:50,124
Easy.

843
00:56:50,833 --> 00:56:52,085
When it comes, the Apocalypse itself

844
00:56:52,293 --> 00:56:55,672
will be part of the process of that leap of evolution.

845
00:56:58,717 --> 00:57:01,720
Yeah, well, whatever happens, mankind will not cease to exist.

846
00:57:02,178 --> 00:57:06,516
He must. By the very definition of Apocalypse, Mankind must cease to exist,

847
00:57:06,683 --> 00:57:08,226
at least in a material form.

848
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,270
What d'you mean, in a material form?

849
00:57:10,562 --> 00:57:11,522
Well, 'e'll evolve.

850
00:57:11,688 --> 00:57:12,439
What into?

851
00:57:12,731 --> 00:57:14,733
Into something that transcends matter.

852
00:57:15,484 --> 00:57:17,987
Into a species of pure thought. Are you with me?

853
00:57:19,405 --> 00:57:20,322
Yeah. Like a ghost.

854
00:57:21,157 --> 00:57:23,159
No, not like a fuckin' ghost, you big girl's blouse!

855
00:57:23,451 --> 00:57:25,953
Into something that's, like, well beyond our comprehension.

856
00:57:26,204 --> 00:57:27,747
Into a universal consciousness,

857
00:57:27,955 --> 00:57:30,375
Into God. Who is.

858
00:57:30,625 --> 00:57:33,670
By the same principle that time is.

859
00:57:34,629 --> 00:57:36,005
You don't believe in God.

860
00:57:36,506 --> 00:57:37,757
'Course I believe in God.

861
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:44,014
You see... The thing is, Brian

862
00:57:46,058 --> 00:57:48,393
that God is a hateful God.

863
00:57:49,561 --> 00:57:52,523
Must be, because if God is good,

864
00:57:52,898 --> 00:57:54,692
then why is there evil in the world?

865
00:57:55,401 --> 00:57:59,155
Why is there pain and hate and greed and war?

866
00:58:00,364 --> 00:58:01,449
It doesn't make sense.

867
00:58:04,118 --> 00:58:07,622
But if God is a nasty bastard, then you can say, why is there good in the world?

868
00:58:07,914 --> 00:58:10,667
Why is there love and hope and joy?

869
00:58:12,961 --> 00:58:14,546
Well, let's face it, good exists

870
00:58:14,754 --> 00:58:16,840
in order to be fucked up by evil.

871
00:58:17,382 --> 00:58:20,594
The very existence of good enables evil to flourish.

872
00:58:20,927 --> 00:58:23,430
Therefore, God is bad.

873
00:58:24,973 --> 00:58:27,810
And it doesn't matter how many past or future existences you have,

874
00:58:28,018 --> 00:58:31,647
because they're all going to be riddled with grief and anguish

875
00:58:31,855 --> 00:58:33,524
and sickness and death.

876
00:58:35,943 --> 00:58:37,987
You see Brian, God doesn't love you.

877
00:58:39,196 --> 00:58:40,448
God despises you.

878
00:58:42,074 --> 00:58:43,284
So there's no hope.

879
00:58:45,036 --> 00:58:46,788
Mankind is just a component of the device

880
00:58:47,080 --> 00:58:49,874
by which the devil creates itself.

881
00:58:50,875 --> 00:58:51,584
You with me?

882
00:58:55,171 --> 00:58:59,301
You see, what I'm saying, basically, is you can't make an omelette without crackin' a few eggs,

883
00:58:59,509 --> 00:59:03,055
and humanity is just a cracked egg. And the omelette

884
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:05,557
stinks.

885
00:59:13,691 --> 00:59:14,859
Yeah.

886
00:59:36,214 --> 00:59:37,966
Oh. And what's through the round window?

887
00:59:43,096 --> 00:59:44,097
'Oo's that?

888
00:59:45,724 --> 00:59:46,767
Good question.

889
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,103
'Ave you seen 'er before?

890
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,438
Oh yeah. She's there every night.

891
00:59:53,941 --> 00:59:55,443
Good-looking young girl, in't she?

892
00:59:56,485 --> 00:59:57,278
She's all right.

893
00:59:57,695 --> 00:59:59,197
Does she ever 'as fellers up there?

894
01:00:00,031 --> 01:00:00,740
No.

895
01:00:03,201 --> 01:00:05,620
'Ave you ever seen 'er, like, you know, totally naked?

896
01:00:08,790 --> 01:00:09,708
Once.

897
01:00:12,085 --> 01:00:13,336
What's she up to, eh?

898
01:00:13,587 --> 01:00:16,590
I mean, what's her game, taunting people in the middle of the night, eh?

899
01:00:18,133 --> 01:00:22,095
She probably gets a kick out of it.
Like you get a kick out o' watching 'er.

900
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:23,305
I'm doing no such thing.

901
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:24,264
Well, I am.

902
01:00:25,516 --> 01:00:26,558
'Ave your got a 'ard-on?

903
01:00:28,477 --> 01:00:30,354
No, I haven't, as a matter of fact.

904
01:00:31,313 --> 01:00:32,940
You wouldn't tell me if you had, would you?

905
01:00:33,941 --> 01:00:35,693
No, I don't think I would.

906
01:00:40,239 --> 01:00:42,575
- Did you make these youself?
- I did, yeah.

907
01:00:42,784 --> 01:00:43,826
I thought so.

908
01:00:44,744 --> 01:00:46,788
Well, listen, I might be back in a couple of minutes.

909
01:00:48,081 --> 01:00:50,875
Be good. If you can't be good, be careful!

910
01:00:51,084 --> 01:00:53,357
And other cliches.

911
01:00:56,089 --> 01:00:57,257
Tatty-bye, Bri.

912
01:01:13,608 --> 01:01:14,650
Charles !

913
01:01:16,527 --> 01:01:17,153
What?!

914
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,907
Mais il est ou alors? Ecoute, je ne sais pas qui vous etes.

915
01:01:23,785 --> 01:01:26,287
What's the fuck's going on?
Where the bloody hell's Dorfman,

916
01:01:26,371 --> 01:01:28,581
the bastard costs me 30 grands already!

917
01:01:29,124 --> 01:01:30,292
Quoi?!

918
01:01:30,896 --> 01:01:32,690
Qu'est-ce qui se passe?

919
01:01:33,295 --> 01:01:34,254
Fuck !

920
01:01:36,048 --> 01:01:37,132
Sorry about that.

921
01:01:47,268 --> 01:01:50,730
Oh, I'm sorry, love. That's not you on the top floor, is it?

922
01:01:51,397 --> 01:01:53,024
- Dancin'?
- Yeah. Why?

923
01:01:56,152 --> 01:01:57,403
Oh, right. You're a lovely mover.

924
01:01:59,781 --> 01:02:01,825
I'm sorry pet. I'm freaking you out.

925
01:02:01,825 --> 01:02:02,742
Where's Bhapu?

926
01:02:03,451 --> 01:02:04,202
Bhapu?

927
01:02:04,744 --> 01:02:05,870
It's cold.

928
01:02:06,246 --> 01:02:08,498
Listen, I'd better explain myself - you see me brother's working

929
01:02:08,748 --> 01:02:11,752
as an insecurity guard in that fuckin' monstrosity round the back,

930
01:02:11,918 --> 01:02:13,587
and we can see straight into your room.

931
01:02:14,546 --> 01:02:15,631
It's very nice.

932
01:02:16,673 --> 01:02:19,760
Anyway, 'e's got 'is boss comin' round. So 'e's told me to schlep round the streets

933
01:02:19,968 --> 01:02:20,928
for a couple of hours, and I said

934
01:02:21,136 --> 01:02:23,973
I'd come and say 'ello to Isadora Duncan.
Keep you company.

935
01:02:25,558 --> 01:02:28,811
I know it's a big cheeky but I'm a cheeky young monkey!

936
01:02:30,438 --> 01:02:31,314
D'you wanna come in?

937
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:33,149
Is that all right?

938
01:02:44,035 --> 01:02:45,412
How long you been growing that?

939
01:02:46,371 --> 01:02:47,747
About two inches.

940
01:02:48,081 --> 01:02:49,249
It's nice.

941
01:02:49,958 --> 01:02:50,959
You've 'ad a few, an't you, love?

942
01:02:53,086 --> 01:02:54,213
Do you wanna come in?

943
01:02:54,546 --> 01:02:55,672
Thought you'd never ask.

944
01:03:06,851 --> 01:03:08,311
Am I allowed to smoke in 'ere?

945
01:03:09,896 --> 01:03:11,105
Thank Christ for that!

946
01:03:12,899 --> 01:03:14,067
D'you wanna a drink?

947
01:03:17,111 --> 01:03:20,698
I think I better 'ad, don't you? Got a bit of fuckin' catchin' up to do, an't I?

948
01:03:22,575 --> 01:03:23,785
Here's to the monarchy!

949
01:03:27,956 --> 01:03:29,166
- What's funny?
- I'm not laughing.

950
01:03:31,501 --> 01:03:33,253
So, do you live 'ere on yer own, yeah?

951
01:03:36,298 --> 01:03:40,261
Is this what you're reading?
"Jane Austen" by Emma.

952
01:03:41,011 --> 01:03:42,680
It's my favorite book.

953
01:03:42,847 --> 01:03:43,764
Is it really?

954
01:03:46,267 --> 01:03:47,768
I don't read much, meself.

955
01:03:57,529 --> 01:03:58,279
You're from Ireland?

956
01:03:59,781 --> 01:04:00,699
No.

957
01:04:02,492 --> 01:04:03,368
Why?

958
01:04:04,744 --> 01:04:05,662
What's that, a damp patch?

959
01:04:12,169 --> 01:04:13,796
Oh, I never noticed that before.

960
01:04:31,940 --> 01:04:33,233
'Ow's it goin' inside there?

961
01:04:36,820 --> 01:04:37,779
Baby.

962
01:04:59,051 --> 01:05:00,219
'Ow old are you, love?

963
01:05:03,180 --> 01:05:05,474
It's funny, 'cos from over there you look a lot younger.

964
01:05:07,059 --> 01:05:09,187
I think me big brother's quite taken with you.

965
01:05:09,646 --> 01:05:12,440
'E's up there every night, 'avin' a bit of a wank about yer.

966
01:05:12,461 --> 01:05:13,170
Are you with me?

967
01:06:06,413 --> 01:06:07,456
What's the matter?

968
01:06:09,249 --> 01:06:10,376
Don't do that

969
01:06:11,585 --> 01:06:12,670
What, that?

970
01:06:14,046 --> 01:06:15,089
Or that?

971
01:06:17,675 --> 01:06:18,968
Don't you like that?

972
01:06:21,012 --> 01:06:22,680
You don't 'ave to 'urt me

973
01:06:25,641 --> 01:06:27,101
I'm sorry

974
01:07:41,387 --> 01:07:42,430
Bite me.

975
01:07:45,558 --> 01:07:47,185
Fuckin' bite me!

976
01:07:49,854 --> 01:07:50,897
Come on!

977
01:08:14,463 --> 01:08:15,590
'Oo's this?

978
01:08:18,050 --> 01:08:19,135
'Oo's this?

979
01:09:37,634 --> 01:09:39,052
I can't, love.

980
01:09:42,222 --> 01:09:43,598
You look like me mother.

981
01:09:59,365 --> 01:10:02,368
D'you think you can recapture your youth by fuckin' it?

982
01:10:05,037 --> 01:10:07,832
You don't want to fuck me - you'll catch something cruel.

983
01:11:09,229 --> 01:11:10,147
Bonjour

984
01:11:11,315 --> 01:11:12,649
What's goin' on? What're you doin' 'ere?

985
01:11:13,442 --> 01:11:16,028
Well, you see. I was over 'ere, like this,

986
01:11:16,236 --> 01:11:17,696
but that didn't work for me, so I thought

987
01:11:17,947 --> 01:11:20,950
I'd try over here, but I don't think there's much future in this one either.

988
01:11:21,700 --> 01:11:24,036
Fuckin' 'ell! Have you got any suggestions?

989
01:11:26,455 --> 01:11:27,665
So what do you do now?

990
01:11:28,833 --> 01:11:29,917
I'm gonna get some breakfast

991
01:11:30,293 --> 01:11:32,337
I could do somethin' to eat
Can I come with yer?

992
01:11:32,587 --> 01:11:33,630
Well, have you got any money?

993
01:11:33,734 --> 01:11:34,047
No

994
01:11:34,172 --> 01:11:35,340
How you're gonna pay for it?

995
01:11:37,467 --> 01:11:38,676
I'm not

996
01:11:40,845 --> 01:11:41,763
Well, I'm hungry

997
01:11:44,474 --> 01:11:45,517
Did you have to go and beat her up?

998
01:11:46,101 --> 01:11:47,185
I never beat 'er up

999
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,273
You shagged her, though?

1000
01:11:52,816 --> 01:11:53,463
No

1001
01:12:01,283 --> 01:12:02,535
You don't believe me, do you?

1002
01:12:05,413 --> 01:12:06,372
She's older than you

1003
01:12:07,331 --> 01:12:07,999
Bollocks

1004
01:12:08,374 --> 01:12:09,292
Poached egg.

1005
01:12:13,379 --> 01:12:15,715
That skirt's a bit short, innit, love?.
'T's disgraceful

1006
01:12:23,974 --> 01:12:24,933
What's this?

1007
01:12:25,809 --> 01:12:27,227
That's where I'm gonna live

1008
01:12:29,146 --> 01:12:29,813
Where is it?

1009
01:12:31,940 --> 01:12:32,649
Ireland

1010
01:12:33,484 --> 01:12:35,194
I've lived in a cottage before

1011
01:12:35,486 --> 01:12:37,446
What, in one of your past lives?

1012
01:12:39,031 --> 01:12:40,783
Yes, as a matter of fact

1013
01:12:44,120 --> 01:12:45,788
Fuckin' shit-hole, innit?

1014
01:12:50,731 --> 01:12:52,378
Don't waste your life

1015
01:12:52,691 --> 01:12:53,692
What?

1016
01:12:54,047 --> 01:12:56,091
Don't waste your life

1017
01:13:12,066 --> 01:13:13,317
What time does this place close?

1018
01:13:13,525 --> 01:13:14,443
Four o'clock

1019
01:13:15,319 --> 01:13:18,197
Listen, can you tell where I can get somethin' to eat round here?

1020
01:13:18,572 --> 01:13:19,281
What?

1021
01:13:20,491 --> 01:13:22,159
- You've got a very nice smile
- 'Ave I?

1022
01:13:22,577 --> 01:13:23,202
Oh, yeah.

1023
01:14:10,502 --> 01:14:11,544
Sorry, sir

1024
01:14:20,053 --> 01:14:21,179
I'll take that, sir.

1025
01:14:25,893 --> 01:14:27,061
Your lady companion's joinin' you, sir?

1026
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,107
No, - she can't make it today, pal, the old sciatica's

1027
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:33,025
playin' up an' everything, you know?

1028
01:14:34,985 --> 01:14:35,486
Come on

1029
01:14:36,821 --> 01:14:37,613
What?

1030
01:14:39,824 --> 01:14:40,825
Out the car

1031
01:14:41,492 --> 01:14:42,660
But I've only just got in the car.

1032
01:14:42,827 --> 01:14:44,454
Get out of the fuckin' car!!!

1033
01:14:46,122 --> 01:14:48,041
All right Parker, keep your 'air on.

1034
01:14:58,593 --> 01:14:59,803
Well, that was lovely.

1035
01:15:00,387 --> 01:15:01,263
Thank you

1036
01:15:02,181 --> 01:15:03,640
Keep in touch

1037
01:15:28,333 --> 01:15:29,334
Ooh, fuck

1038
01:15:38,969 --> 01:15:40,012
'Oo are you?

1039
01:15:40,846 --> 01:15:41,889
Sebastian Hawks.

1040
01:15:42,639 --> 01:15:43,515
Nice to meet you

1041
01:15:44,558 --> 01:15:45,851
Yeah, er, what're you doin' 'ere?

1042
01:15:46,143 --> 01:15:47,895
I'm an acquaintance of Sandra's

1043
01:15:48,479 --> 01:15:50,022
I've just popped round to say hallo

1044
01:15:50,356 --> 01:15:52,149
Well, Sandra's away at the moment, actually

1045
01:15:53,109 --> 01:15:55,820
Really?
I hope you don't mind,

1046
01:15:55,987 --> 01:15:57,113
but I helped myself to a beer

1047
01:15:57,572 --> 01:16:00,867
Yeah, I noticed. Is that your champagne an' all?

1048
01:16:02,076 --> 01:16:03,286
You like champagne, do you?

1049
01:16:04,162 --> 01:16:06,206
Yeah. I do, as it 'appens.

1050
01:16:06,915 --> 01:16:08,833
This is a very nice flat, don't you think?

1051
01:16:09,626 --> 01:16:10,877
'Ow'd you get in 'ere?

1052
01:16:11,253 --> 01:16:13,171
Tell me, d'you have any problems with the central heating?

1053
01:16:13,380 --> 01:16:14,756
Oh, are you the plumber?

1054
01:16:15,173 --> 01:16:16,967
Let's just say I've got a vested interest in the property

1055
01:16:17,968 --> 01:16:19,720
Fuckin' 'ell, you're the landlord.

1056
01:16:20,387 --> 01:16:21,847
I'd rather you thought of me as a friend

1057
01:16:22,306 --> 01:16:23,307
Oh shit!

1058
01:16:24,516 --> 01:16:26,435
What, is Sandra behind on the rent or somethin'?

1059
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:27,770
Was your tattoo painful?

1060
01:16:27,978 --> 01:16:29,021
Yeah

1061
01:16:31,983 --> 01:16:32,900
Good

1062
01:16:35,486 --> 01:16:37,071
You're very beautiful, aren't you?

1063
01:16:38,406 --> 01:16:39,157
Am I?

1064
01:16:40,783 --> 01:16:42,786
In a quirky sort of way.

1065
01:16:45,580 --> 01:16:46,706
Are you a nurse?

1066
01:16:46,831 --> 01:16:48,667
Yeah. Psychiatric.

1067
01:16:53,338 --> 01:16:55,215
These are a very fetching pair of tights

1068
01:16:55,549 --> 01:16:58,093
Ah, you like them, do yer, Mr Landlord?

1069
01:16:59,386 --> 01:17:01,055
Can we 'ave that champagne now, please?

1070
01:17:01,263 --> 01:17:02,097
Did you buy them

1071
01:17:02,264 --> 01:17:03,891
like this or are the holes self-inflicted?

1072
01:17:05,142 --> 01:17:07,728
No. A spider spun them, and that's where he 'ad a tea-break.

1073
01:17:09,605 --> 01:17:11,691
Fuckin' 'ell! That's a bit excessive, innit?

1074
01:17:11,983 --> 01:17:13,568
I rather like this belt too

1075
01:17:13,776 --> 01:17:15,653
Oh, God! 'Ere we go.

1076
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:21,951
Excuse me, where d'you think you're going?

1077
01:17:22,077 --> 01:17:22,869
I'm goin' home

1078
01:17:23,161 --> 01:17:24,162
What, are you leavin' me?

1079
01:17:24,704 --> 01:17:26,915
I've come all this way to see you and you're goin'!
I can't believe it,

1080
01:17:27,123 --> 01:17:28,792
I'm stunned, I'm flabbergasted.

1081
01:17:29,000 --> 01:17:30,460
Shall we get you a tissue?

1082
01:17:30,669 --> 01:17:32,546
Sounds promisin'. Do you live nearby?

1083
01:17:33,755 --> 01:17:34,715
I might do.

1084
01:17:34,923 --> 01:17:36,842
I mean, is it within walking distance?

1085
01:17:41,096 --> 01:17:43,599
No, 'cause you see, I've got this fascination with all things peripatetic.

1086
01:17:43,808 --> 01:17:44,683
See you!

1087
01:17:45,559 --> 01:17:46,769
I'm cheeky, aren't I?

1088
01:17:49,355 --> 01:17:52,817
Have you stolen the teacosy?
Love, people can see you wearin' that thing,

1089
01:17:52,984 --> 01:17:54,944
are you not embarassed? No?

1090
01:18:17,384 --> 01:18:18,510
Don't give up

1091
01:18:30,815 --> 01:18:31,691
Put this on!

1092
01:18:32,900 --> 01:18:36,571
Oh, what? We're gonna play doctors and nurses now, are we?

1093
01:18:36,779 --> 01:18:37,822
Hurry up!

1094
01:18:46,039 --> 01:18:47,207
Oh, this is ridiculous.

1095
01:18:47,874 --> 01:18:50,669
Listen, I'm really sorry, right?

1096
01:18:51,211 --> 01:18:52,880
But I've had a bit of a rough week,

1097
01:18:53,130 --> 01:18:55,674
and I just don't think I can go through with this

1098
01:18:57,301 --> 01:18:58,802
Oh, no! No!

1099
01:19:02,515 --> 01:19:06,102
Fuck off! leave me alove! No!

1100
01:19:10,857 --> 01:19:12,358
You fuckin' bastard!!

1101
01:19:17,739 --> 01:19:18,990
D'you want some beans?

1102
01:19:21,618 --> 01:19:22,661
Yeah, cheers.

1103
01:19:24,204 --> 01:19:26,039
So, what would you be doin' now if I wasn't 'ere?

1104
01:19:27,374 --> 01:19:28,500
Dunno

1105
01:19:29,418 --> 01:19:31,545
Having a shower, relaxin'

1106
01:19:32,337 --> 01:19:33,547
I could do with a shower myself

1107
01:19:33,714 --> 01:19:35,090
I haven't washed for about a week

1108
01:19:35,257 --> 01:19:37,051
As you've probably noticed

1109
01:19:37,927 --> 01:19:39,345
Well, you can 'ave one if you like

1110
01:19:40,346 --> 01:19:41,222
Are you sure?

1111
01:19:41,847 --> 01:19:44,350
Yeah. Bathroom's just here

1112
01:19:47,061 --> 01:19:48,062
Fuckin' 'ell

1113
01:19:49,480 --> 01:19:51,441
What did I do to deserve you, love?

1114
01:19:53,109 --> 01:19:54,110
Just press this button

1115
01:19:57,697 --> 01:19:58,740
Now listen

1116
01:19:59,824 --> 01:20:02,953
You're not going to creep up on me with a big knife dressed up as your mother, are you?

1117
01:20:03,620 --> 01:20:04,454
No.

1118
01:20:10,002 --> 01:20:12,129
Although it looks like you already are dressed up as your mother

1119
01:20:25,101 --> 01:20:26,310
Can I have me bag?

1120
01:20:27,603 --> 01:20:29,188
It's got me duck in it.

1121
01:20:36,363 --> 01:20:37,155
Ta

1122
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:11,524
Oh dear

1123
01:21:13,151 --> 01:21:15,320
'Oo lives 'ere, then? Zeus?

1124
01:21:18,615 --> 01:21:20,283
Is all this stuff yours?

1125
01:21:21,284 --> 01:21:21,994
No.

1126
01:21:22,703 --> 01:21:24,162
All these pseudo-Doric midgets

1127
01:21:24,413 --> 01:21:25,914
with their novelty underpants

1128
01:21:26,039 --> 01:21:28,751
Oh, look at this one, touchin' time with a bargepole

1129
01:21:29,126 --> 01:21:30,461
I wouldn't

1130
01:21:34,882 --> 01:21:37,093
Is 'e a home-owner-sexual, yeah?

1131
01:21:37,843 --> 01:21:39,053
What do you think?

1132
01:21:39,846 --> 01:21:40,930
Where is 'e?

1133
01:21:41,347 --> 01:21:42,223
They're in America

1134
01:21:42,598 --> 01:21:43,516
They?

1135
01:21:43,766 --> 01:21:44,767
Yeah.

1136
01:21:45,018 --> 01:21:46,144
When are they gettin' back?

1137
01:21:46,311 --> 01:21:47,270
Dunno

1138
01:21:48,813 --> 01:21:50,440
And they're just letting you stop 'ere, for nothin, yeah?

1139
01:21:53,818 --> 01:21:54,819
Yeah. I don't know them

1140
01:21:55,737 --> 01:21:58,031
I don't know, I find this all a bit sad

1141
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,032
Why?

1142
01:21:59,950 --> 01:22:02,244
No, I don't mean that to sound homophobic

1143
01:22:02,744 --> 01:22:04,329
I mean, I like The Iliad

1144
01:22:05,330 --> 01:22:07,416
and The Odyssey. D'you get that?

1145
01:22:08,459 --> 01:22:09,501
No

1146
01:22:13,130 --> 01:22:15,633
So, 'ave you read many of these books?

1147
01:22:15,675 --> 01:22:16,801
No, I haven't.

1148
01:22:18,511 --> 01:22:20,096
Oh, I've read quite a few

1149
01:22:22,140 --> 01:22:23,016
Oh, look!

1150
01:22:23,308 --> 01:22:24,517
D'you get it now?

1151
01:22:25,852 --> 01:22:26,853
D'you know this?

1152
01:22:28,605 --> 01:22:30,815
I bet you do. You've most likely done it at school

1153
01:22:30,982 --> 01:22:32,025
You just can't remember

1154
01:22:32,317 --> 01:22:33,985
You know, like, Achilles' heel

1155
01:22:34,194 --> 01:22:36,738
the Wooden Horse, Helen of Troy.
You know them?

1156
01:22:37,447 --> 01:22:38,282
Yeah.

1157
01:22:38,907 --> 01:22:39,741
yeah, well, that's all it is.

1158
01:22:42,035 --> 01:22:43,412
Good stuff. Cyclops.

1159
01:22:43,704 --> 01:22:44,538
Oh, hallo,

1160
01:22:45,497 --> 01:22:47,583
it's Pizza Deliveryman

1161
01:22:54,548 --> 01:22:55,591
D'you want those beans?

1162
01:22:57,218 --> 01:22:58,302
Oh, yeah, I forgot

1163
01:23:30,044 --> 01:23:32,713
Sebastian Hawks. Good evening.

1164
01:23:35,258 --> 01:23:36,968
Very nice to meet you, Louise.

1165
01:23:37,635 --> 01:23:39,178
Oh, very nice to meet you

1166
01:23:40,013 --> 01:23:41,681
I've heard a lot about you

1167
01:23:48,229 --> 01:23:49,147

1168
01:23:50,857 --> 01:23:52,067
Yeah? Yeah, I'm in 'ere

1169
01:23:53,819 --> 01:23:55,904
- Oh, are you all right?
- I've never been better

1170
01:23:56,488 --> 01:23:59,158
We've had a very interesting afternoon, haven't we, Sophie?

1171
01:23:59,408 --> 01:24:00,951
It's been fascinatin'!

1172
01:24:14,632 --> 01:24:16,467
For services rendered

1173
01:24:17,260 --> 01:24:18,678
Fuck off!

1174
01:24:22,390 --> 01:24:23,600
'Oo's your friend?

1175
01:24:24,059 --> 01:24:25,268

1176
01:24:25,477 --> 01:24:26,853
'Oose landlord?

01:24:26,978 --> 01:24:27,938
Our fuckin' landlord

1178
01:24:28,104 --> 01:24:29,940
- Oh, get out o'town!

1179
01:24:32,484 --> 01:24:33,652
What you wearin' Sandra's uniform for?

1180
01:24:34,486 --> 01:24:36,071
I don't want to talk about it, all right?

1181
01:24:37,448 --> 01:24:38,615
Well, d'you wanna cup o'tea?

1182
01:24:38,668 --> 01:24:39,241
Yeah

01:24:45,247 --> 01:24:46,957
So,'ave you been sittin' on 'is face all afternoon?

1184
01:24:47,375 --> 01:24:48,334
I don't need this

1185
01:24:48,876 --> 01:24:50,545
Jesus Christ, I get 'ome from work,

1186
01:24:50,795 --> 01:24:53,256
all I want to do is to put me feet up and watch the telly,

1187
01:24:53,464 --> 01:24:56,175
not get involved in one of your orgies. D'you know what I mean?

1188
01:25:01,765 --> 01:25:03,308
What 'appened to your arm?

1189
01:25:07,062 --> 01:25:09,356
Sophie, what's been goin' on?

1190
01:25:11,400 --> 01:25:12,859
Have you put the kettle on?

1191
01:25:13,485 --> 01:25:13,902
Yeah

1192
01:25:14,862 --> 01:25:16,655
Any chance of a coffee, Louise?

1193
01:25:17,406 --> 01:25:18,490
Yeah, sure

1194
01:25:20,951 --> 01:25:22,495
These are a very nice pair of shorts

1195
01:25:22,703 --> 01:25:24,705
Would you take your 'ands off me, please?

1196
01:25:25,748 --> 01:25:27,041
I apologise

1197
01:25:31,379 --> 01:25:34,173
Right, pal. 'Ere's your clothes, get your kit on and sling yer 'ook.

1198
01:25:34,424 --> 01:25:35,466
'Ere's your shoes, mate

1199
01:25:40,388 --> 01:25:42,015
Hope I haven't given you AIDS, Sophie.

1200
01:25:42,328 --> 01:25:44,893
- Jesus Christ
- Fuckin' 'ell!! Are you serious?

1201
01:25:45,769 --> 01:25:46,853
Merely jesting.

1202
01:25:47,104 --> 01:25:47,979
Very funny.

1203
01:25:48,647 --> 01:25:50,482
Mind you, I think AIDS is rather healthy in its way.

1204
01:25:50,649 --> 01:25:51,567
You what?

1205
01:25:51,817 --> 01:25:53,735
I realize that's not the fashionable thing to say, of course.

1206
01:25:53,861 --> 01:25:54,903
No. It's not.

1207
01:25:55,195 --> 01:25:57,698
But the world is overcrowded, isn't it? It could do with a bit of pruning.

1208
01:25:58,365 --> 01:25:59,700
Fuckin' better be jokin'.

1209
01:26:00,618 --> 01:26:01,994
You're not going to have children, are you, Louise?

1210
01:26:02,411 --> 01:26:03,996
I might do, one day.

1211
01:26:04,330 --> 01:26:05,998
I loathe children, I must say

1212
01:26:06,207 --> 01:26:07,959
I bet they're not too keen on you, neither

1213
01:26:10,503 --> 01:26:13,214
- I'm sure you like fucking, don't you, Louise?
- Are you goin'?

1214
01:26:13,423 --> 01:26:14,591
I'm rather enjoying myself, actually

1215
01:26:14,841 --> 01:26:16,634
- Well, we're not
- That's a pity

1216
01:26:17,051 --> 01:26:21,181
Look, you may be the landlord from hell, but that doesn't give you the right to lie on our couch

1217
01:26:22,474 --> 01:26:23,391
Whose couch?

1218
01:26:23,600 --> 01:26:25,060
D'you want me to phone the police?

1219
01:26:25,227 --> 01:26:26,311
Be my guest

1220
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:28,730
Right

1221
01:26:34,695 --> 01:26:36,906
- Listen, I can't 'ave them in 'ere?
- Why not?

1222
01:26:37,156 --> 01:26:39,492
They gonna take one look at 'im in 'is suit and one look at us

1223
01:26:39,784 --> 01:26:40,951
and 'oo d'you think they're gonna believe?

1224
01:26:41,160 --> 01:26:43,245
There's fuckin' dope all over the place

1225
01:26:43,537 --> 01:26:45,832
Well, we're just windin' him up - 'e's loving this.

1226
01:26:46,582 --> 01:26:47,834
What are we gonna do?

1227
01:26:53,256 --> 01:26:54,924
It's very peaceful in 'ere, isn't it?

1228
01:26:56,760 --> 01:26:58,136
I suppose so

1229
01:27:01,556 --> 01:27:02,724
Are you warm enough?

1230
01:27:03,767 --> 01:27:05,477
Yeah, this is nice - thanks

1231
01:27:07,104 --> 01:27:10,023
It's funny, 'cos the silence usually freaks me out

1232
01:27:11,275 --> 01:27:12,943
You start to pick up on all the small sounds,

1233
01:27:13,152 --> 01:27:15,446
you know what I mean? Like that clock

1234
01:27:19,575 --> 01:27:21,744
I hate that fuckin' clock

1235
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:23,496
Of course you do - it's a clock

1236
01:27:26,249 --> 01:27:27,208
Is it all right if I stay here

1237
01:27:27,375 --> 01:27:28,501
tonight?

1238
01:27:33,256 --> 01:27:34,257
'Ve you ever 'ad

1239
01:27:34,424 --> 01:27:35,258
a dog?

1240
01:27:37,928 --> 01:27:38,720
No.

1241
01:27:41,598 --> 01:27:42,557
I don't like dogs

1242
01:27:43,308 --> 01:27:44,101
Why?

1243
01:27:44,935 --> 01:27:46,645
Well, they're either vicious or daft

1244
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:50,274
- Why, 'ave you?
- Yeah

1245
01:27:51,775 --> 01:27:52,651
Is it dead now?

1246
01:27:52,776 --> 01:27:53,652
Yeah.

1247
01:27:54,612 --> 01:27:55,654
Did you bury it?

1248
01:27:56,363 --> 01:27:58,449
I dunno, me dad took it

1249
01:28:00,576 --> 01:28:03,704
And what about you? Would you like to be buried or cremated?

1250
01:28:04,038 --> 01:28:05,081
I couldn't give a shit

1251
01:28:09,919 --> 01:28:11,004
I 'ad this dream the other night, about these two skeletons 'aving a fuck.

1252
01:28:11,254 --> 01:28:16,551
It was a right bloody racket - woke me up.

1253
01:28:18,762 --> 01:28:20,138
'Ave you got a photo of your mum?

1254
01:28:25,018 --> 01:28:26,019
What, on me?

1255
01:28:26,436 --> 01:28:27,354
Yeah

1256
01:28:29,565 --> 01:28:30,170
No

1257
01:28:31,442 --> 01:28:34,528
But I think you might find one over at the newsagent's, on the top shelf

1258
01:28:36,822 --> 01:28:38,032
D'you want some beans?

1259
01:28:47,500 --> 01:28:49,002
You've got a very sad face

1260
01:28:49,169 --> 01:28:50,170
'Ave I?

1261
01:28:51,337 --> 01:28:52,213
It's all right, I mean,

1262
01:28:52,380 --> 01:28:53,840
I find that attractive

1263
01:28:56,384 --> 01:28:57,803
But that's me

1264
01:29:00,847 --> 01:29:02,933
So, 'ave you got a boyfriend or anythin'?

1265
01:29:14,820 --> 01:29:16,155
What are gonna do for Christmas?

1266
01:29:18,616 --> 01:29:20,326
I don't know. What're you gonna do?

1267
01:29:23,287 --> 01:29:24,205
You all right?

1268
01:29:28,168 --> 01:29:29,002
What's the matter?

1269
01:29:29,127 --> 01:29:30,337
Fuck off!

1270
01:29:59,158 --> 01:30:00,410
What's up love?

1271
01:30:02,829 --> 01:30:04,080
Was it something I said?

1272
01:30:04,330 --> 01:30:05,415
I want you to go

1273
01:30:05,832 --> 01:30:06,708
Why?

1274
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:08,334
Can you go, please?!

1275
01:30:09,628 --> 01:30:10,712
Is it 'cos I don't like dogs?

1276
01:30:11,254 --> 01:30:12,589
Get out!!

1277
01:30:13,757 --> 01:30:15,092
I don't quite follow, love

1278
01:30:15,258 --> 01:30:16,718
Just fuck off!!

1279
01:30:18,345 --> 01:30:19,346
Oh, I see

1280
01:30:22,224 --> 01:30:26,896
Well, perhaps I was jumpin' to conclusions, but I got the impression I could kip down on the sofa or somethin'

1281
01:30:27,646 --> 01:30:29,815
- Go!
- Go where?

1282
01:30:29,940 --> 01:30:31,359
'Ave you got any suggestions? 'Cos it's like

1283
01:30:31,525 --> 01:30:33,527
a fuckin' Eskimo's grave out there.

1284
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:36,781
All right, I'm going

1285
01:31:28,460 --> 01:31:30,170
It's not easy, is it?

1286
01:31:33,632 --> 01:31:34,675
D'you find that?

1287
01:31:45,394 --> 01:31:46,771
Well, just goes to show you

1288
01:31:47,855 --> 01:31:49,690
that no matter how many books you read,

1289
01:31:49,815 --> 01:31:53,111
there's some things in this world that you never, ever, ever, ever,

1290
01:31:53,277 --> 01:31:56,364
ever fuckin' understand.

1291
01:32:16,468 --> 01:32:18,637
Thank you for the tea, and the bath,

1292
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:19,805
and the booze.

1293
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:22,850
And the beans.

1294
01:32:30,817 --> 01:32:32,652
And listen love,

1295
01:32:32,944 --> 01:32:34,779
I hope that when you're tucked up tonight

1296
01:32:35,029 --> 01:32:38,074
all snug and warm underneath your tear-sodden fuckin' duvet

1297
01:32:38,241 --> 01:32:40,493
and your ankle-length Emily Bronte windin'-sheet

1298
01:32:40,660 --> 01:32:43,580
that you spare a thought for me, with my head in a puddle of cold dog's piss,

1299
01:32:43,830 --> 01:32:45,707
An' I hope that you dream about me.

1300
01:32:46,124 --> 01:32:48,001
An' I hope that you wake up screaming.

1301
01:32:50,128 --> 01:32:52,047
And I hope that all your fuckin' children

1302
01:32:52,256 --> 01:32:56,301
are born blind, bow-legged, hare-lipped, homeless hunchbacks!!

1303
01:33:11,025 --> 01:33:12,819
'Ave you ever 'ad an abortion?

1304
01:33:15,113 --> 01:33:15,864
'Ave you?

1305
01:33:16,072 --> 01:33:18,324
No. I thought I was pregnant once.

1306
01:33:18,950 --> 01:33:19,993
Would you 'ave 'ad one?

1307
01:33:20,201 --> 01:33:23,371
Will, In the end, it turned out I wasn't, and 'e left me anyway, so...

1308
01:33:24,790 --> 01:33:26,416
I wanted to keep mine

1309
01:33:27,000 --> 01:33:28,126
What happened?

1310
01:33:28,752 --> 01:33:31,630
All my mates said I couldn't look after a baby

1311
01:33:32,923 --> 01:33:34,508
Too fuckin' right.

1312
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,260
Did it make you feel shitty?

1313
01:33:37,177 --> 01:33:38,470
It was a nightmare.

1314
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:41,265
I really loved 'im

1315
01:33:43,059 --> 01:33:44,393
'E was a philosopher

1316
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:45,811
Where was this?

1317
01:33:46,103 --> 01:33:46,896
Paris.

1318
01:33:48,356 --> 01:33:50,775
You should've seen the state of 'is girlfriend

1319
01:33:53,236 --> 01:33:55,447
'Ad one when I was fifteen, an' all.

1320
01:33:55,655 --> 01:33:57,115
Oh, Jesus, Sophie!

1321
01:33:58,033 --> 01:33:59,826
I think that one was worse for my mum,

1322
01:34:00,035 --> 01:34:02,078
fuckin' drama she made out of it

1323
01:34:05,207 --> 01:34:08,210
I could've been married by now, with a four-year-old

1324
01:34:09,169 --> 01:34:10,587
D'you want to get married?

1325
01:34:11,588 --> 01:34:12,881
Don't know

1326
01:34:15,634 --> 01:34:19,138
Just 'cos you 'ave a kid with someone doesn't mean they're gonna stick around.

1327
01:34:19,847 --> 01:34:23,267
My dad didn't. 'E couldn't fuckin' wait to get out.

1328
01:34:23,601 --> 01:34:25,895
Well, don't know if I want to get married,

1329
01:34:26,062 --> 01:34:28,731
but I wouldn't say no to a proper relationship

1330
01:34:29,649 --> 01:34:31,734
What is a proper relationship?

1331
01:34:32,986 --> 01:34:36,322
Livin' with someone 'oo talks to you after they've bonked you.

1332
01:34:38,199 --> 01:34:40,494
I don't know what they want from you 'alf the time.

1333
01:34:42,037 --> 01:34:43,413
What they start off liking you for

1334
01:34:43,580 --> 01:34:45,374
they end up hatin' you for.

1335
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:49,211
Don't like you if you're strong, don't like you if you're weak;

1336
01:34:49,962 --> 01:34:52,881
hate you if you're clever, hate you if you're stupid.

1337
01:34:54,300 --> 01:34:55,718
They don't know what they want.

1338
01:35:01,349 --> 01:35:03,851
D'you think that bastard's fucked off yet?

1339
01:35:05,603 --> 01:35:07,313
Yeah, he musta done by now.

1340
01:35:46,312 --> 01:35:47,814
Is this a stick-up?

1341
01:35:49,941 --> 01:35:52,235
- Sorry - you must get that all the time, yeah?
- Yeah

1342
01:35:52,527 --> 01:35:53,695
Just got it again.

1343
01:35:55,864 --> 01:35:58,575
So is this your job, or a nice little hobby you've got for yourself?

1344
01:36:00,369 --> 01:36:01,703
You're a lovely mover!

1345
01:36:10,588 --> 01:36:12,256
- This your van, yeah?
- Yeah

1346
01:36:12,882 --> 01:36:15,176
It's like, er, I dunno, top o' the range.

1347
01:36:15,801 --> 01:36:16,719
Very nice

1348
01:36:17,053 --> 01:36:18,554
Are you goin' up the road?

1349
01:36:19,013 --> 01:36:19,847
D'you wanna lift?

1350
01:36:21,099 --> 01:36:22,308
Is that all right with you?

1351
01:36:23,184 --> 01:36:24,102
Cheers

1352
01:36:24,644 --> 01:36:27,897
It's just, I've been walkin' round the streets all night, you know what I mean?

1353
01:36:28,148 --> 01:36:30,817
These fuckin' feet are on their last legs, I'm telling you.

1354
01:36:35,489 --> 01:36:37,282
So, 'ow much d'you earn for doin' this?

1355
01:36:37,407 --> 01:36:38,950
It's none of your fuckin' business

1356
01:36:39,368 --> 01:36:43,330
I mean, is the pay as substantial as say, the wages of sin?

1357
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:44,706
You know what I mean? Are you with me?

1358
01:36:45,416 --> 01:36:47,751
Listen, Captain, is it all right if I 'ave a go at doin' this, yeah?

1359
01:36:49,587 --> 01:36:51,797
Oh! God love you!

1360
01:36:52,006 --> 01:36:54,550
I mean, or does it take like thousands of years of like

1361
01:36:54,717 --> 01:36:55,968
state-subsidized government training to do this clobber, yeah?

1362
01:36:56,177 --> 01:36:58,262
You've gotta slap on like copious quantities

1363
01:36:58,471 --> 01:37:01,015
of the old industrial sputum there.

1364
01:37:01,599 --> 01:37:02,058
Beg your puddin'

1365
01:37:03,351 --> 01:37:05,603
It's a wonderful career opportunity for me -

1366
01:37:06,062 --> 01:37:08,148
you know what I mean? I'm not gonna play the joker on this one.

1367
01:37:09,295 --> 01:37:10,337
- Shift
- It's all goin' very well

1368
01:37:11,276 --> 01:37:12,736
Shift out the fuckin' way, will you?

1369
01:37:12,944 --> 01:37:15,572
No, I like Laurel and Hardy, you know, although apparently they didn't get on in real life,

1370
01:37:15,822 --> 01:37:18,158
You know, another illusion shattered.

1371
01:37:19,952 --> 01:37:22,830
Sorry about that pal, it's just I've 'ad a lot of bad experience with walls,

1372
01:37:23,038 --> 01:37:25,457
you know, what with talking to them and climbing them,

1373
01:37:25,624 --> 01:37:28,002
and me dad's driven me up a good few of them in 'is time, you know what I mean?

1374
01:37:28,210 --> 01:37:30,880
But I think I've got the secret. The saucy little secret,

1375
01:37:31,088 --> 01:37:34,216
this solipsistic, sagacious little secret is just, you got - you just gotta

1376
01:37:34,425 --> 01:37:37,345
bang your fuckin' head against them!

1377
01:37:37,428 --> 01:37:39,555
Just crack the old pate.

1378
01:37:40,014 --> 01:37:41,307
Are you with me?! 'Ave you got it?

1379
01:37:41,557 --> 01:37:45,061
And that's it, that's the key to enlightenment, which is, it's like that's why,

1380
01:37:45,270 --> 01:37:50,191
it's like such a potent motif of civilization - it's the wall.

1381
01:37:50,275 --> 01:37:53,820
It's like the, the Great Wall of China, and the Wall of Jericho

1382
01:37:54,029 --> 01:37:56,156
and the Berlin Wall, and the Wailin' Wall

1383
01:37:56,323 --> 01:37:58,575
Now you see the Jews, they've almost got it, an't they?

1384
01:37:58,784 --> 01:38:01,537
What with the old rockin' and that, and you know, just that six inches away

1385
01:38:01,745 --> 01:38:04,623
and they'd be there, they'd have won the fuckin' race, they'll be there, you with me?

1386
01:38:04,832 --> 01:38:07,793
What is all this, anyway? What are you doin'? Cancel everythin'.

1387
01:38:08,085 --> 01:38:10,504
In the beginnin' there was the Word, and the word was 'cancelled'

1388
01:38:10,671 --> 01:38:13,799
D'you get like satisfaction out of this?
D'you think you're makin' a contribution?

1389
01:38:14,008 --> 01:38:17,303
You're like sort of publicly promulgatin' vacuities? Are you with me?

1390
01:38:18,221 --> 01:38:19,472
Fuckin' hell!!

1391
01:38:22,684 --> 01:38:25,311
Oh, that's it! Blank it all out! Blank it all out

1392
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:28,106
till you just atrophy and die of fuckin' indifference.

1393
01:38:28,315 --> 01:38:30,400
Can I show you somethin', pal? You see that at the top of your legs?

1394
01:38:30,650 --> 01:38:33,862
That's your arse and that's your fuckin' elbow! Do you want to write it down or s-

1395
01:38:39,076 --> 01:38:40,869
'Oo's that supposed to be, me dad?

1396
01:38:41,078 --> 01:38:44,582
You wanna watch that, mate - I've got a dicky sacrum 'ere

1397
01:38:44,790 --> 01:38:46,208
Shit!

1398
01:38:48,669 --> 01:38:52,215
Can you come back here? Did I upset you?

1399
01:38:59,389 --> 01:39:03,309
You've got me bag! You fuckin' tosser!!

1400
01:39:03,685 --> 01:39:04,352
You f-

1401
01:39:09,191 --> 01:39:10,233
Fuck!!

1402
01:39:11,610 --> 01:39:14,905
Oh, listen!! Does anybody mind if I scream 'ere?

1403
01:39:14,947 --> 01:39:16,698
Is that OK with you all? 'Cos I'd feel better

1404
01:39:16,907 --> 01:39:18,492
for it - won't take long!

1405
01:39:23,289 --> 01:39:24,331
Fuck

1406
01:40:39,577 --> 01:40:40,411
'Os's that?

1407
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:09,816
Oh Jesus!

1408
01:41:11,401 --> 01:41:13,028
What's been happenin' to you?

1409
01:41:13,195 --> 01:41:15,531
Will you shut up, for God's sake?

1410
01:41:22,371 --> 01:41:23,831
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry

1411
01:41:24,665 --> 01:41:25,917
Just give us a fag

1412
01:41:28,044 --> 01:41:29,462
Fuckin' comedian

1413
01:41:39,222 --> 01:41:41,725
- It's not my fault
- What's not your fault?

1414
01:41:44,811 --> 01:41:45,979
Where are you goin'?

1415
01:41:46,229 --> 01:41:47,773
I just want to go to bed

1416
01:41:47,981 --> 01:41:49,733
Be quiet!

1417
01:41:50,109 --> 01:41:51,610
I fuckin' walked 'ere

1418
01:41:51,819 --> 01:41:52,778
Where from?

1419
01:41:56,782 --> 01:41:57,783
Johnny.

1420
01:42:01,245 --> 01:42:02,830
I'm gonna be sick

1421
01:42:14,509 --> 01:42:16,428
Fuckin' 'ell, what's 'appened to 'im?

1422
01:42:16,636 --> 01:42:17,721

Johnny, are you all right, Johnny?

1424
01:42:19,514 --> 01:42:20,766
Get off!

1425
01:42:25,354 --> 01:42:26,813
Is 'e still 'ere?

1426
01:42:27,564 --> 01:42:28,690
I dunno

1427
01:43:01,975 --> 01:43:03,894
Right, we'd better get him into bed

1428
01:43:04,561 --> 01:43:06,605
You take that end, I'll take this end

1429
01:43:06,980 --> 01:43:07,773
OK, don't push me, right?

1430
01:43:07,940 --> 01:43:09,358
I'm not pushin' you!

1431
01:43:12,069 --> 01:43:13,571
Careful, that's 'is bad leg

1432
01:43:13,779 --> 01:43:14,822
Well, what d'you want me to do?

1433
01:43:15,030 --> 01:43:16,198
After three

1434
01:43:17,408 --> 01:43:19,160
One, two, three

1435
01:43:21,537 --> 01:43:23,331
I wanna go!

1436
01:44:11,715 --> 01:44:12,841

01:44:14,801 --> 01:44:16,052
I know, you told me

1438
01:44:20,015 --> 01:44:22,726
I'm not here yet. I'm still wet

1439
01:44:25,896 --> 01:44:27,356
What did she mean?

1440
01:44:29,608 --> 01:44:31,402
Why not me brother?

1441
01:44:36,949 --> 01:44:38,618
Will it be quiet now?

1442
01:44:47,210 --> 01:44:48,086
Are we goin'?

1443
01:44:48,878 --> 01:44:49,546
Fuck!

1444
01:45:06,146 --> 01:45:06,981
Who's this?

1445
01:45:07,147 --> 01:45:08,232
It's all right, 'e's a friend of mine

1446
01:45:09,358 --> 01:45:13,654
What extraordinary friends you have. He's only got one sock on.

1447
01:45:13,988 --> 01:45:14,822
Shut up!

1448
01:45:15,364 --> 01:45:18,242
You seem a bit tense, Sophie. Would you like a massage?

1449
01:45:18,451 --> 01:45:19,535
Are you the doctor?

1450
01:45:19,744 --> 01:45:20,495
Pardon?

1451
01:45:20,703 --> 01:45:21,788
Is he the doctor?

1452
01:45:21,913 --> 01:45:23,915
You're rather disgusting, aren't you?

1453
01:45:29,504 --> 01:45:31,339
You're not crying, are you, Louise?

1454
01:45:31,548 --> 01:45:33,675
Oh, listen, when are you gonna fuck off?

1455
01:45:33,884 --> 01:45:36,261
This 'as got nothin' to do with you, right?

1456
01:45:37,846 --> 01:45:38,764
No! No!

1457
01:45:41,934 --> 01:45:42,893
Leave me alone!

1458
01:45:43,602 --> 01:45:44,728
Fuckin' 'ell, me leg!

1459
01:45:47,857 --> 01:45:48,774
You don't know

1460
01:45:48,983 --> 01:45:50,568
Aren't people pathetic?

1461
01:45:57,158 --> 01:45:58,826
Right. I'm going to beddy-byes.

1462
01:46:06,293 --> 01:46:09,045
If anyone wishes to join me, I'll be under the duvet

1463
01:46:16,637 --> 01:46:17,888
Are you all right?

1464
01:46:18,097 --> 01:46:19,139
Yeah. Are you?

1465
01:46:19,431 --> 01:46:20,391
Yeah.

1466
01:46:25,312 --> 01:46:26,772
Come on, I'll give you a hand.

1467
01:46:27,440 --> 01:46:28,941
I'm all right, I walked 'ere.

1468
01:46:53,759 --> 01:46:55,093
Is it 'ere?

1469
01:46:55,886 --> 01:46:56,887
Yeah.

1470
01:46:59,306 --> 01:47:00,557
'Oo's that?

1471
01:47:00,849 --> 01:47:01,851
Clancy.

1472
01:47:02,518 --> 01:47:03,853
I thought so.

1473
01:47:06,063 --> 01:47:07,440
I used to know you, didn't I?

1474
01:47:08,107 --> 01:47:09,108
Yeah.

1475
01:47:18,284 --> 01:47:20,954
"Take me back to Manchester

1476
01:47:21,538 --> 01:47:24,124
when it's raining.

1477
01:47:25,041 --> 01:47:29,755
I want to wet me feet in Albert Square.

1478
01:47:30,672 --> 01:47:36,095
I'm all agog
For a good, thick fog.

1479
01:47:36,720 --> 01:47:38,597
I don't like the sun,

1480
01:47:38,806 --> 01:47:42,101
I like it raining cats and dogs!

1481
01:47:42,768 --> 01:47:48,191
I want to smell the odours of the Irwell.

1482
01:47:48,900 --> 01:47:52,945
I want to feel the soot get in me 'air,

1483
01:47:54,447 --> 01:47:57,158
Oh, I don't want to roam.

1484
01:47:57,367 --> 01:48:00,495
I want to get back 'ome

1485
01:48:01,121 --> 01:48:04,749
to rainy Manchester"

1486
01:48:09,296 --> 01:48:10,464
I've got an 'ard-on.

1487
01:49:20,370 --> 01:49:21,121
What's...?

1488
01:49:25,584 --> 01:49:27,169
What are you...?

1489
01:49:29,004 --> 01:49:31,882
This is...It's disgusting!

1490
01:49:34,176 --> 01:49:35,427
Nobody, in my....

1491
01:49:35,928 --> 01:49:37,054
Who's 'e?

1492
01:49:38,222 --> 01:49:39,807
You've got your boots on! She's...

1493
01:49:42,393 --> 01:49:43,686
And what's this doing?

1494
01:49:46,147 --> 01:49:50,652
This is something I can't...
I don't....

1495
01:49:54,030 --> 01:49:57,742
It's not...I just don't need all this...palaver.

1496
01:49:59,744 --> 01:50:01,246
Oh, shit!

1497
01:50:14,301 --> 01:50:15,636
Ok, who's Jeremy ?

1498
01:50:16,470 --> 01:50:18,347
- Who's Jeremy ?
- What you mean?

1499
01:50:18,848 --> 01:50:20,933
Sandra! What a nice surprise!

1500
01:50:21,100 --> 01:50:22,518
What are you doing here?

1501
01:50:22,685 --> 01:50:23,811
How was Zimbabwe?

1502
01:50:24,228 --> 01:50:25,313
Shift!

1503
01:50:26,522 --> 01:50:27,482
Morning, Louise.

1504
01:50:27,649 --> 01:50:29,609
- Where's Jeremy ?
- 'Oo's Jeremy ?

1505
01:50:29,901 --> 01:50:31,111
These are Jeremy's

1506
01:50:31,277 --> 01:50:32,570
That's Sebastian's.

1507
01:50:32,696 --> 01:50:36,908
No, look. Jeremy Smart.
Jeremy Smart. Jeremy G. Smart.

1508
01:50:37,117 --> 01:50:38,368
Well, I've never 'eard of him.

1509
01:50:40,412 --> 01:50:44,208
Sebastian. Who -
Are you Jeremy G. Smart ?

1510
01:50:45,334 --> 01:50:46,168
Are you?

1511
01:50:46,919 --> 01:50:49,004
Johnny! Johnny, wake up

1512
01:50:49,296 --> 01:50:50,047
Just leave 'im

1513
01:50:50,214 --> 01:50:52,341
Oh, for fuck's sake, Sophie, Sandra's back.

1514
01:50:52,550 --> 01:50:54,093
- What day is it?
- It's Friday

1515
01:50:54,260 --> 01:50:55,052
Fuck this

1516
01:50:55,344 --> 01:50:56,595
Look at 'is eye

1517
01:50:56,700 --> 01:50:57,430
Christ

1518
01:50:57,513 --> 01:50:59,056
Well, he can lie down in my room - oh, God!

1519
01:51:00,516 --> 01:51:02,727
What're you doin'? 'E's not 'arming anyone

1520
01:51:02,894 --> 01:51:04,228
'Ave you seen the state of 'er?

1521
01:51:04,729 --> 01:51:06,231
- Johnny!
- I'm here, Johnny

1522
01:51:06,439 --> 01:51:07,357
Morning, everyone

1523
01:51:07,565 --> 01:51:09,901
I would, actually, like to have some kind of

1524
01:51:10,235 --> 01:51:12,362
explanation for all this, because...

1525
01:51:13,196 --> 01:51:14,155
- Having fun?
- Can you put these on, please?

1526
01:51:14,573 --> 01:51:17,576
Sophie and I had a fuck on your bed yesterday afternoon, Sandra.

1527
01:51:19,536 --> 01:51:22,414
- She was very good, I must say
- You are just...filth!
- Not as good as you, though

1528
01:51:22,998 --> 01:51:25,626
You lying...nastiness!

1529
01:51:27,378 --> 01:51:28,671
We must do it again sometime

1530
01:51:32,967 --> 01:51:34,218
Will you...?

1531
01:51:35,052 --> 01:51:36,596
How can you...?

1532
01:51:37,722 --> 01:51:38,848
Everything!

1533
01:51:41,351 --> 01:51:42,852
I can't cope with this

1534
01:51:43,061 --> 01:51:44,854
You've got five minutes

1535
01:51:45,438 --> 01:51:48,441
Five minutes to get your things on and get the hell...

1536
01:51:48,650 --> 01:51:50,944
I shouldn't worry about things so much, if I were you

1537
01:51:52,821 --> 01:51:55,240
I'd forgotten what a beautiful bottom you've got, Sandra

1538
01:51:55,407 --> 01:51:56,366
Two minutes

1539
01:52:01,288 --> 01:52:02,831
Marvellous tits!

1540
01:52:05,751 --> 01:52:08,671
Listen, Sandra, I'm really sorry. We weren't expectin' you back.

1541
01:52:10,548 --> 01:52:11,882
I fail to...why...

1542
01:52:12,174 --> 01:52:13,259
It's a pigsty ... it's...

1543
01:52:13,801 --> 01:52:14,844
I know - it just got out of hand

1544
01:52:15,052 --> 01:52:17,138
Obviously. And what's all that?

1545
01:52:17,346 --> 01:52:19,307
'E's a friend of mine - Look, can I make you a cup o'tea?

1546
01:52:19,515 --> 01:52:22,143
I don't want tea... I don't want...

1547
01:52:22,435 --> 01:52:24,854
I just want...  My journey was...

1548
01:52:25,063 --> 01:52:26,106
He's not very well!

1549
01:52:26,314 --> 01:52:27,232
What's the matter with 'im?

1550
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:30,610
'E's got a lump on his face the size of a boiled egg an' 'he won't wake up

1551
01:52:40,412 --> 01:52:41,622
Did he do this?

1552
01:52:41,830 --> 01:52:43,666
- 'Oo ?
- Sebastian - Jeremy?

1553
01:52:43,916 --> 01:52:45,626
You never warned me about 'im, did you?

1554
01:52:45,834 --> 01:52:46,627
What are you talking about?

1555
01:52:46,794 --> 01:52:49,797
Fuckin' lettin' 'imself in with the keys! Bastard!

1556
01:52:49,964 --> 01:52:50,881
I don't...

1557
01:52:52,049 --> 01:52:53,509
Right. Let's get

1558
01:52:53,718 --> 01:52:54,594
this shoe off.

1559
01:52:56,471 --> 01:52:59,432
Have you ever had smoked salmon after making love, Louise?

1560
01:53:00,058 --> 01:53:01,184
Don't like smoked salmon

1561
01:53:01,768 --> 01:53:04,771
I think you should try it.
It's rather wonderful.

1562
01:53:05,355 --> 01:53:07,148
Will you undo your flies, Sebastian?

1563
01:53:11,111 --> 01:53:12,237
Would you like me to?

1564
01:53:19,077 --> 01:53:20,037
Honest.

1565
01:53:42,227 --> 01:53:44,938
Or d'you not want me to slice your prick off and shove it up your arse?

1566
01:53:56,742 --> 01:53:57,701
Maggot dick!

1567
01:54:09,130 --> 01:54:10,590
Could you pass me that pillow, please?

1568
01:54:10,798 --> 01:54:12,341
- I can't move, Sandra
- Here you go

1569
01:54:12,717 --> 01:54:14,969
You are worse than useless

1570
01:54:15,136 --> 01:54:17,639
Ooh, are y'all right? You don't think it's broken, do you?

1571
01:54:17,889 --> 01:54:19,015
No, 'e can move it.

1572
01:54:19,516 --> 01:54:20,850
You can do that, can't you?

1573
01:54:21,476 --> 01:54:22,978
Why would I want to do that?

1574
01:54:23,228 --> 01:54:26,189
Don't even...
Not in my room, Sophie.

1575
01:54:26,398 --> 01:54:27,858
I need a fag

1576
01:54:28,150 --> 01:54:30,277
I don't care. Cop hold o'that.

1577
01:54:30,527 --> 01:54:32,029
Just don't start, right?

1578
01:54:32,487 --> 01:54:36,450
It really is beyond me the way you girls choose to live your lives

1579
01:54:37,743 --> 01:54:39,703
My mind just boggles

1580
01:54:40,955 --> 01:54:42,373
'E's gone back to sleep

1581
01:54:45,084 --> 01:54:46,210
Was that the front door?

1582
01:54:46,752 --> 01:54:47,628
'E's gone

1583
01:54:47,795 --> 01:54:48,629
Thank God

1584
01:54:58,765 --> 01:54:59,933
Go slowly, Johnny.

1585
01:55:00,183 --> 01:55:02,894
Now what you two must do is take this one to Casualty

1586
01:55:03,061 --> 01:55:06,148
and make sure he gets himself looked at, 'fore he goes home.

1587
01:55:06,398 --> 01:55:07,065
I'm gonna be sick.

1588
01:55:07,190 --> 01:55:08,483
- Are you?
- Get him into the bathroom!

1589
01:55:08,588 --> 01:55:10,423
All right! Let's not...

1590
01:55:10,986 --> 01:55:11,987
Just a minute...

1591
01:55:12,404 --> 01:55:13,322
That's it.

1592
01:55:13,968 --> 01:55:15,616
- Take it steady.
- Here y'are

1593
01:55:18,118 --> 01:55:19,495
It's in me tash.

1594
01:55:20,579 --> 01:55:22,123
You wanna gerrit cut.

1595
01:55:26,335 --> 01:55:27,587
It's in your mouth

1596
01:55:30,089 --> 01:55:31,507
'Ave you 'ad a bath lately?

1597
01:55:32,258 --> 01:55:33,259
Yeah, I 'ad one yesterday

1598
01:55:33,468 --> 01:55:34,719
- As if!
- I did!

1599
01:55:34,969 --> 01:55:36,221
Where've you been, Johnny?

1600
01:55:36,596 --> 01:55:37,847
Down the Via Dolorosa.

1601
01:55:38,181 --> 01:55:39,224
Don't be nosy

1602
01:55:42,227 --> 01:55:44,020
- Are you not goin' to work?
- I'm late

1603
01:55:44,229 --> 01:55:45,313
Oh, you'll get the sack

1604
01:55:45,856 --> 01:55:46,898
Yeah.

1605
01:55:47,357 --> 01:55:49,276
It's all right - you can put all your troubles in it.

1606
01:55:50,444 --> 01:55:51,570
'Ey, I lost me bag.

1607
01:55:52,237 --> 01:55:53,697
Yeah, I noticed. Where is it?

1608
01:55:53,906 --> 01:55:54,948
I don't know. It's lost.

1609
01:55:55,366 --> 01:55:56,283
Any valuables?

1610
01:55:56,951 --> 01:55:59,703
Yeah, it's got me collection of famous retired glove-puppets in there.

1611
01:56:00,371 --> 01:56:01,664
That's it - all gone.

1612
01:56:02,206 --> 01:56:03,249
Did you get it nicked?

1613
01:56:05,376 --> 01:56:06,461
Would you put that out?

1614
01:56:22,436 --> 01:56:24,020
I 'an't cleaned me teeth yet

1615
01:56:24,646 --> 01:56:27,274
Could you not just put 'em in a glass or something, no?

1616
01:56:44,125 --> 01:56:47,336
I remember when you bought these shorts. I warned you

1617
01:56:47,628 --> 01:56:48,504
about 'em then.

1618
01:56:48,755 --> 01:56:50,214
Yeah, well,

1619
01:56:55,428 --> 01:56:56,888
I only got them to piss you off

1620
01:56:57,180 --> 01:56:58,306
Mission accomplished.

1621
01:57:01,351 --> 01:57:02,394
Is he all right?

1622
01:57:03,645 --> 01:57:04,271
Yeah

1623
01:57:08,275 --> 01:57:10,778
What is this, a spectator sport or something?

1624
01:57:11,195 --> 01:57:12,321
The hundred-metre vomit.

1625
01:57:17,702 --> 01:57:18,995
Sophie, d'you mind if I 'ave a word

1626
01:57:19,203 --> 01:57:21,080
with Johnny on me own?

1627
01:57:27,962 --> 01:57:30,256
D'you want a word with Louise on your own?

1628
01:57:30,924 --> 01:57:31,966
Are you bein' sarcastic?

1629
01:57:32,175 --> 01:57:32,801
No

1630
01:57:34,052 --> 01:57:35,095
Well, do as you're told.

1631
01:57:37,806 --> 01:57:38,682
Right...

1632
01:57:43,020 --> 01:57:44,062
Whose is all this money?

1633
01:57:44,354 --> 01:57:45,481
Three hundred and eighty pounds,

1634
01:57:45,814 --> 01:57:47,900
it's really oughtn't to be left laying waiting for ...

1635
01:58:00,246 --> 01:58:01,164
Whose is all that?

1636
01:58:02,206 --> 01:58:03,166
Dunno

1637
01:58:10,423 --> 01:58:12,175
Who's been playing ping-pong with your face?

1638
01:58:12,968 --> 01:58:17,180
The sky fell in on me. A cloud caught me across the cheek.

1639
01:58:20,267 --> 01:58:21,685
So, why did you come to London?

1640
01:58:22,394 --> 01:58:23,437
I come to run in the Marathon

1641
01:58:23,645 --> 01:58:25,522
Will you give me a straight answer, please?

1642
01:58:27,858 --> 01:58:30,152
Well, I 'ad to get out of Manchester

1643
01:58:30,152 --> 01:58:31,570
'cos I was gonna get a beatin'

1644
01:58:31,737 --> 01:58:35,241
And I come down 'ere, and I get a beatin'

1645
01:58:35,491 --> 01:58:36,325
Were you asking for it?

1646
01:58:36,534 --> 01:58:37,535
No.

1647
01:58:37,702 --> 01:58:39,412
I wasn't. They just came out of nowhere.

1648
01:58:39,996 --> 01:58:40,705
Honest?

1649
01:58:40,872 --> 01:58:41,789
Yeah.

1650
01:58:46,794 --> 01:58:47,879
So what are you gonna do?

1651
01:58:48,129 --> 01:58:49,130
What are you gonna do?

1652
01:58:49,881 --> 01:58:51,049
What are you gonna do?

1653
01:58:52,425 --> 01:58:54,636
Dunno. Might go 'ome for the weekend.

1654
01:58:55,470 --> 01:58:56,763
Well, there's no place like it.

1655
01:58:58,056 --> 01:58:59,182
Might not come back.

1656
01:59:01,476 --> 01:59:02,811
Are you goin' back?

1657
01:59:08,609 --> 01:59:09,401
Is that nice?

1658
01:59:11,862 --> 01:59:12,822
Yeah.

1659
01:59:13,531 --> 01:59:15,032
I'm puttin' the fun back in 'fundament'.

1660
01:59:16,826 --> 01:59:17,743
Are yer?

1661
01:59:19,036 --> 01:59:20,747
Well, I'll 'ave to go back sometime, won't I?

1662
01:59:21,247 --> 01:59:21,956
And what about us?

1663
01:59:22,290 --> 01:59:23,416
What about us?

1664
01:59:29,214 --> 01:59:30,173
Do you hate me?

1665
01:59:31,091 --> 01:59:31,841
Fuck off!

1666
01:59:36,847 --> 01:59:38,807
My mam was seven years younger than you when she had me.

1667
01:59:39,016 --> 01:59:39,954
- Don't.
- What?

1668
01:59:40,058 --> 01:59:40,580
Just...

1669
01:59:42,561 --> 01:59:43,604
Well, she was!

1670
01:59:47,316 --> 01:59:48,442
I'm full o' shit, aren't I?

1671
01:59:48,609 --> 01:59:49,527
Sometimes

1672
01:59:49,860 --> 01:59:51,570
Yeah, well, it's all right, I've had it all kicked out of me now

1673
01:59:51,862 --> 01:59:53,030
Oh? Good

1674
01:59:55,616 --> 01:59:58,036
What if God just put us 'ere for his own entertainment?

1675
01:59:59,454 --> 02:00:02,832
That's all we are. Just somethin' for 'im to 'ave

1676
02:00:02,916 --> 02:00:05,335
a bit of a laugh at. Could be, couln'n't it?

1677
02:00:06,461 --> 02:00:07,629
If you think about it.

1678
02:00:10,882 --> 02:00:11,967
Give us your right 'and.

1679
02:00:13,343 --> 02:00:14,511
Other way up.

1680
02:00:24,897 --> 02:00:25,856
What's that?

1681
02:00:27,900 --> 02:00:29,068
That's funny to me

1682
02:00:29,276 --> 02:00:30,569
You're daft, you

1683
02:00:30,820 --> 02:00:32,613
It's toilet humor

1684
02:00:36,534 --> 02:00:37,869
Will you give me a cuddle,

1685
02:00:38,161 --> 02:00:39,203
Johnny?

1686
02:00:39,913 --> 02:00:40,788
Yeah.

1687
02:01:26,962 --> 02:01:29,881
If no one tells me what's going on, then how am I supposed -

1688
02:01:30,215 --> 02:01:32,175
I don't understand, Johnny!

1689
02:01:32,509 --> 02:01:34,469
- 'Ow was Zambia?
- It was Zimbabwe!

1690
02:01:34,803 --> 02:01:38,432
I went to Zimbabwe with my wanker boyfriend, my ex...

1691
02:01:38,724 --> 02:01:40,809
What did I do wrong?

1692
02:01:41,101 --> 02:01:42,394
Did you see any big animals?

1693
02:01:42,603 --> 02:01:45,314
Yes! We saw elephants and rhinos and zebras

1694
02:01:45,564 --> 02:01:46,983
and lions and vultures...

1695
02:01:47,191 --> 02:01:48,150
Did you see any monkeys?

1696
02:01:48,401 --> 02:01:49,485
We saw many monkeys.

1697
02:01:49,694 --> 02:01:53,031
And were they cheeky?
Oh, it is not good for me, is it, all this, in my condition?

1698
02:01:53,322 --> 02:01:55,116
Well, yes, no, yes...

1699
02:01:55,575 --> 02:01:59,621
It's not good for me. It's not good for you.
It's not good for any of us, it's utterly...

1700
02:01:59,913 --> 02:02:02,123
Oh, excuse me for living!

1701
02:02:06,503 --> 02:02:08,213
Is, is this it, Johnny?

1702
02:02:09,256 --> 02:02:10,173
- Is it?
- Is what it?

1703
02:02:10,549 --> 02:02:12,426
Oh, I can't bear it!

1704
02:02:14,511 --> 02:02:16,263
Right! I'm off!

1705
02:02:17,264 --> 02:02:18,265
Off your trolley.

1706
02:02:18,474 --> 02:02:22,019
Oh, don't fuckin' take a piss out of me you bastard!!

1707
02:02:22,728 --> 02:02:24,313
You don't know!

1708
02:02:24,814 --> 02:02:26,399
All I want...

1709
02:02:26,816 --> 02:02:28,109
Nobody has any...

1710
02:02:29,110 --> 02:02:30,445
Can you just please try...

1711
02:02:31,070 --> 02:02:32,864
I've 'ad enough.

1712
02:02:33,323 --> 02:02:34,324
This is a nightmare!

1713
02:02:36,284 --> 02:02:38,703
Sophie, if you just try and pull yourself together

1714
02:02:38,912 --> 02:02:40,705
- Where are you going?
- I don't know

1715
02:02:40,830 --> 02:02:42,249
Why don't you come in and have a lie-down?

1716
02:02:42,457 --> 02:02:43,708
I don't care!

1717
02:02:43,917 --> 02:02:44,751
Sophie!

1718
02:02:44,751 --> 02:02:46,420
- Here's the key
- Well, I don't wan' 'em!

1719
02:02:46,795 --> 02:02:48,297
Well I don't fuckin' want them!

1720
02:02:48,630 --> 02:02:50,382
I'm not a social worker!

1721
02:02:51,508 --> 02:02:55,054
Look, Sophie. Don't be fuckin' stupid!

1722
02:02:55,387 --> 02:02:57,139
What's the point, Louise?

1723
02:02:59,767 --> 02:03:00,476
Sophie!

1724
02:03:02,186 --> 02:03:03,521
I'm sorry

1725
02:03:29,214 --> 02:03:30,278
Johnny

1726
02:03:39,850 --> 02:03:40,810
You all right?

1727
02:03:43,229 --> 02:03:44,355
I'm goin'

1728
02:03:45,022 --> 02:03:45,565
Where?

1729
02:03:45,857 --> 02:03:47,734
Work. To 'and my notice in.

1730
02:03:48,151 --> 02:03:49,819
Then I'm comin' back 'ere, I'm packing me bags,

1731
02:03:50,028 --> 02:03:51,863
and I'm goin' 'ome.  D'you wanna come?

1732
02:03:52,864 --> 02:03:53,782
- Today?
- Yeah.

1733
02:03:53,990 --> 02:03:55,200
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1734
02:03:55,825 --> 02:03:57,327
- 'Ow?
- Bus.

1735
02:04:00,956 --> 02:04:02,541
- Well, 'ave you got enough dough?
- Yeah.

1736
02:04:02,707 --> 02:04:04,376
- 'Cos I've not got nothin'
- I know.

1737
02:04:07,754 --> 02:04:09,089
D'you think you can make it?

1738
02:04:10,674 --> 02:04:11,508
Don't know.

1739
02:04:13,677 --> 02:04:16,388
Well, if you dpn't, we can stay 'ere until tomorrow.

1740
02:04:29,152 --> 02:04:30,111
See you later.

1741
02:04:32,363 --> 02:04:34,532
Can you leave us a few fags for cancer research?

1742
02:04:35,158 --> 02:04:36,242
Here are your...

1743
02:04:37,911 --> 02:04:39,162
I was actually hoping that the air could...

1744
02:04:41,540 --> 02:04:43,000
What are we gonna do about all this...

1745
02:04:43,959 --> 02:04:47,379
I dunno, Sandra.
Look, I'll see you in a couple of hours.

1746
02:04:47,838 --> 02:04:48,547
Fine.

1747
02:04:48,839 --> 02:04:49,882
You will come back?

1748
02:04:50,924 --> 02:04:52,051
Yeah, of course I will

1749
02:04:52,259 --> 02:04:53,093
Because I need...

1750
02:04:53,260 --> 02:04:54,178
You'll be all right, won't you?

1751
02:04:54,595 --> 02:04:55,930
Will I be all right, love?

1752
02:04:56,847 --> 02:04:58,349
I'm going to get the bath cleaned.

1753
02:05:16,993 --> 02:05:19,204
You all know what it does to you

1754
02:05:19,413 --> 02:05:22,708
and yet you still insist on doing it, so... do it.

1755
02:05:23,750 --> 02:05:25,252
Smoke yourself to...

1756
02:05:25,419 --> 02:05:27,463
Well, birds do it, bees do it.

1757
02:05:27,921 --> 02:05:28,756
..high heaven.

1758
02:05:30,424 --> 02:05:31,926
Can you tell me something, love?

1759
02:05:32,134 --> 02:05:34,428
Is it true that some babies are born covered in fur?

1760
02:05:34,720 --> 02:05:35,554
Up.

1761
02:05:38,057 --> 02:05:38,933
Thank you.

1762
02:05:39,559 --> 02:05:41,602
And you know at birth when they cut the umbilical cord?

1763
02:05:41,811 --> 02:05:44,522
What would happen if, well, if it was never cut?

1764
02:05:46,399 --> 02:05:48,693
I don't need this. I just...

1765
02:05:48,985 --> 02:05:50,362
Well it would be embarrassin', wouldn't it?

1766
02:05:50,362 --> 02:05:51,613
Specially at my age.

1767
02:05:51,821 --> 02:05:54,574
Why do you feel the need to take the piss?

1768
02:05:55,242 --> 02:05:57,452
I'm not takin' a piss.
It's nice, that -

1769
02:05:57,661 --> 02:05:58,704
Where it is from?

1770
02:05:58,912 --> 02:06:00,914
I don't know, it's something my dad...

1771
02:06:01,623 --> 02:06:02,249
Now you see,

1772
02:06:02,374 --> 02:06:04,376
Sophie just turned that to the wall, she's got

1773
02:06:04,522 --> 02:06:06,837
this kind of an irritating proclivity for negation -

1774
02:06:07,046 --> 02:06:08,839
I suppose she thinks it's progressive, or somethin'.

1775
02:06:09,131 --> 02:06:10,591
What is your problem?

1776
02:06:11,008 --> 02:06:12,176
Nothing. What is your problem?

1777
02:06:12,343 --> 02:06:14,345
All these silly questions and...

1778
02:06:15,805 --> 02:06:17,640
Well, look, I've never met a nurse before, and

1779
02:06:17,849 --> 02:06:19,559
I'm just interested in, well, in life.

1780
02:06:20,560 --> 02:06:22,061
I mean, d'you think it's worth savin'?

1781
02:06:22,312 --> 02:06:26,733
Of course I do. But there is a time and a place,

1782
02:06:27,066 --> 02:06:30,403
and actually this isn't the time or...

1783
02:06:31,863 --> 02:06:32,614
The place?

1784
02:06:32,906 --> 02:06:34,825
No. And this

1785
02:06:35,826 --> 02:06:37,119
is where I...

1786
02:06:37,995 --> 02:06:38,578
Live?

1787
02:06:38,704 --> 02:06:39,371
Yes,

1788
02:06:39,997 --> 02:06:42,291
- and I'm not feeling very...
- Sexy?

1789
02:06:42,750 --> 02:06:45,169
Comfortable, actually. I'm not feeling very comfortable.

1790
02:06:45,586 --> 02:06:48,464
Well make yourself comfortable, love. Or slip into something more...

1791
02:06:48,547 --> 02:06:49,194
comfortable

1792
02:06:51,175 --> 02:06:52,301
My bath!

1793
02:06:53,344 --> 02:06:56,681
Hot toast... hot milk.. hot-water bottle

1794
02:06:56,889 --> 02:06:58,141
bed, sleep.

1795
02:06:58,474 --> 02:06:59,350
D'you like me?

1796
02:07:00,143 --> 02:07:01,894
I don't know you, so...

1797
02:07:02,145 --> 02:07:03,605
D'you find me attractive?

1798
02:07:05,648 --> 02:07:07,817
Well, listen, love, it's like this - I find you attractive. Very attractive.

1799
02:07:09,235 --> 02:07:12,113
Enough. I've had enough.

1800
02:07:12,739 --> 02:07:16,702
It comes at me from all angles.

1801
02:07:17,160 --> 02:07:18,579
You... all of you just...

1802
02:07:19,163 --> 02:07:20,539
it's the tin lid...

1803
02:07:21,290 --> 02:07:25,252
When... how will the world ever...

1804
02:07:25,669 --> 02:07:27,004
End.

1805
02:07:27,296 --> 02:07:28,380
Yes!
