1
00:02:07,612 --> 00:02:08,778
Still got it.

2
00:04:41,849 --> 00:04:43,767
What's that?

3
00:04:43,851 --> 00:04:45,602
An old friend.

4
00:04:47,271 --> 00:04:49,356
I was rummaging
through a closet

5
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,441
and it was just
sitting there.

6
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:55,362
It's nice, Paul.
It's got character.

7
00:04:55,446 --> 00:04:57,822
When I wrote my first book, I
used to carry it around in this

8
00:04:57,907 --> 00:05:00,033
while I was looking
for a publisher.

9
00:05:00,117 --> 00:05:01,326
I was a writer then.

10
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,702
You're still a writer.

11
00:05:03,412 --> 00:05:06,289
Haven't been a writer since I
got in the Misery business.

12
00:05:06,374 --> 00:05:10,919
It's not a bad business. And it
would still be growing, too.

13
00:05:11,003 --> 00:05:12,879
The first printing
for Misery's Child

14
00:05:12,963 --> 00:05:15,715
was the most ever.
Over a million.

15
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,884
Marcia, please.

16
00:05:17,968 --> 00:05:20,387
Misery Chastain put braces
on your daughter's teeth

17
00:05:20,471 --> 00:05:21,888
and is putting her
through college,

18
00:05:21,972 --> 00:05:24,307
bought you two houses and
floor seats to the Knicks.

19
00:05:24,392 --> 00:05:27,227
And what thanks does she get?
You go and kill her!

20
00:05:27,311 --> 00:05:30,438
I never meant for it
to become my life.

21
00:05:30,523 --> 00:05:32,565
And if I hadn't
gotten rid of her now,

22
00:05:32,650 --> 00:05:34,859
I'd have ended up
writing her forever.

23
00:05:34,944 --> 00:05:39,114
Now I'm leaving for Colorado
to try to finish the new book.

24
00:05:39,198 --> 00:05:44,202
If I can make this work, I might just
have something I want on my tombstone.

25
00:07:04,950 --> 00:07:07,827
I'm your
number-one fan.

26
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:10,663
There's nothing
to worry about.

27
00:07:10,748 --> 00:07:15,335
You're gonna be just fine.
I'll take good care of you.

28
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,505
I'm your number-one fan.

29
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:29,641
Where...

30
00:07:31,352 --> 00:07:33,436
We're just outside
Silver Creek.

31
00:07:36,065 --> 00:07:37,440
How long?

32
00:07:37,942 --> 00:07:41,778
You've been here two days.
You're gonna be okay.

33
00:07:43,197 --> 00:07:44,822
My name is Annie Wilkes.

34
00:07:44,907 --> 00:07:46,491
My number-one fan.

35
00:07:47,743 --> 00:07:51,287
Yes. That's right.
I'm also a nurse.

36
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:56,125
Here, take these.

37
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:28,658
Here.

38
00:08:30,327 --> 00:08:32,287
- What are they?
- They're called Novril.

39
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:34,080
They're for your pain.

40
00:08:46,135 --> 00:08:47,594
Thank you.

41
00:08:55,269 --> 00:08:57,353
How come I'm not
in a hospital?

42
00:08:57,438 --> 00:09:00,940
The blizzard was too strong. I
couldn't risk trying to get you there.

43
00:09:01,025 --> 00:09:04,193
I tried calling, but the
phone lines are down.

44
00:09:05,696 --> 00:09:09,365
You mustn't tire yourself.
You've gotta rest.

45
00:09:10,451 --> 00:09:12,368
You almost died.

46
00:09:24,089 --> 00:09:25,673
Open wide.

47
00:09:31,388 --> 00:09:34,474
Your legs just sing grand opera
when you move, don't they?

48
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:38,311
It's not gonna hurt forever,
Paul, I promise you.

49
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,689
Will I be able to walk?

50
00:09:41,774 --> 00:09:42,857
Of course you will.

51
00:09:42,941 --> 00:09:45,485
And your arm
will be fine, too.

52
00:09:45,569 --> 00:09:47,820
Your shoulder was
pretty badly dislocated.

53
00:09:47,905 --> 00:09:51,115
It was a little stubborn, but
I finally popped it back in.

54
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,035
What I'm most proud of is the
work I did on those legs.

55
00:09:54,119 --> 00:09:55,620
Considering what
I had around the house,

56
00:09:55,704 --> 00:09:58,706
I don't think there's a doctor
who could've done any better.

57
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:05,046
It's not nearly
as bad as it looks.

58
00:10:05,130 --> 00:10:08,341
You have a compound fracture
of the tibia in both legs,

59
00:10:08,425 --> 00:10:11,344
and the fibula in the right
leg is fractured, too.

60
00:10:11,428 --> 00:10:12,679
I could hear
the bones moving,

61
00:10:12,763 --> 00:10:16,307
so it's best for your legs
to remain immobile.

62
00:10:16,392 --> 00:10:18,184
And as soon as
the roads open,

63
00:10:18,268 --> 00:10:20,353
I'll take you to a hospital.

64
00:10:20,437 --> 00:10:23,481
Meantime, you've got
a lot of recovering to do,

65
00:10:23,565 --> 00:10:27,193
and I consider it an honor
that you'll do it in my home.

66
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:37,870
This is Marcia Sindell, I'm
calling from New York City.

67
00:10:37,955 --> 00:10:40,998
I'd like to speak to the Silver
Creek Chief of Police or Sheriff.

68
00:10:41,083 --> 00:10:42,250
Which one
of them do you want?

69
00:10:42,334 --> 00:10:43,710
Whichever one's not busy.

70
00:10:43,794 --> 00:10:46,713
Well, I'm pretty sure they're
both not busy, Miss Sindell,

71
00:10:46,797 --> 00:10:48,631
since they're both me.

72
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:53,302
I also happen to be president of the
Policeman's Benefit Association,

73
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,555
chairman of the Patrolman's
Retirement Fund,

74
00:10:55,639 --> 00:10:59,684
and if you need a good fishing
guide, you could do a lot worse.

75
00:10:59,768 --> 00:11:02,228
Call me Buster.
Everybody does.

76
00:11:02,312 --> 00:11:04,021
What can I do for you?

77
00:11:04,106 --> 00:11:07,734
I'm a literary agent, and I... I
feel like a fool calling you,

78
00:11:07,818 --> 00:11:11,571
but I think one of my
clients, Paul Sheldon,

79
00:11:11,655 --> 00:11:13,364
might be in some
kind of trouble.

80
00:11:14,158 --> 00:11:16,200
You mean Paul Sheldon
the writer?

81
00:11:17,035 --> 00:11:18,327
He's your client, huh?

82
00:11:18,412 --> 00:11:19,620
Yes, he is.

83
00:11:19,705 --> 00:11:22,582
Everybody sure likes
those Misery books.

84
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:26,919
I'm sure you know that Paul's been
coming to the Silver Creek Lodge

85
00:11:27,004 --> 00:11:28,838
for years
to finish his books.

86
00:11:28,922 --> 00:11:31,758
I understand he's been up
here the last six weeks.

87
00:11:31,842 --> 00:11:34,761
Well, not quite.
I just called there

88
00:11:34,845 --> 00:11:39,307
and they said he checked
out last Tuesday.

89
00:11:39,391 --> 00:11:40,767
Isn't that
a little strange?

90
00:11:40,851 --> 00:11:42,810
I don't know.
Does he usually phone you

91
00:11:42,895 --> 00:11:44,854
before he checks
out of a hotel?

92
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:50,109
No, of course not. It's just that
his daughter hasn't heard from him,

93
00:11:50,194 --> 00:11:54,238
and when he has a new book coming
out, he usually keeps in touch.

94
00:11:54,323 --> 00:11:56,949
Now when there wasn't
any word from him, I...

95
00:11:57,034 --> 00:11:59,076
You think he might
be missin', huh?

96
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,248
I hate that I made this call.
Tell me I'm being silly.

97
00:12:04,333 --> 00:12:09,796
A little overprotective, maybe,
but tell you what I'll do.

98
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,756
Nothing's been
reported out here,

99
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:14,675
but I'll put his name
through our system, and

100
00:12:16,094 --> 00:12:19,138
if anything turns up,
I'll call you right back.

101
00:12:19,223 --> 00:12:21,599
I'd appreciate that.
Thanks a lot.

102
00:12:21,683 --> 00:12:23,851
Goodbye, Miss Sindell.

103
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:27,647
We got a phone call?
Busy morning.

104
00:12:27,731 --> 00:12:30,066
Yeah. Work, work, work.

105
00:12:30,859 --> 00:12:33,820
Virginia,
when was that blizzard?

106
00:12:33,904 --> 00:12:36,364
Last Tuesday. Why?

107
00:12:37,407 --> 00:12:38,866
No reason.

108
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,255
I guess it was kind of a
miracle, you finding me.

109
00:12:53,674 --> 00:12:56,008
No, it wasn't
a miracle at all.

110
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:59,220
In a way,
I was following you.

111
00:12:59,304 --> 00:13:00,429
You were following me?

112
00:13:00,514 --> 00:13:03,850
Well, it wasn't any secret to me you
were staying at the Silver Creek,

113
00:13:03,934 --> 00:13:06,727
seeing as how I'm your
number-one fan and all.

114
00:13:07,521 --> 00:13:10,439
Some nights I'd just tool on
down there and sit outside

115
00:13:10,524 --> 00:13:14,026
and look up at
the light in your cabin

116
00:13:14,111 --> 00:13:16,070
and I'd try to imagine what
was goin' on in the room

117
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,572
of the world's
greatest writer.

118
00:13:17,656 --> 00:13:19,657
Say the last part again,
I didn't hear you.

119
00:13:19,741 --> 00:13:21,200
Don't move now.

120
00:13:21,285 --> 00:13:23,870
I wouldn't want
to hurt this neck.

121
00:13:24,955 --> 00:13:29,292
Well, the other afternoon
I was on my way home,

122
00:13:29,376 --> 00:13:32,378
and there you were,
leavin' the lodge.

123
00:13:32,462 --> 00:13:35,256
And I wondered why a literary
genius would go for a drive

124
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:37,216
when there was
a big storm comin'.

125
00:13:37,301 --> 00:13:39,844
I didn't know there was
a big storm coming.

126
00:13:39,928 --> 00:13:43,723
Well, lucky for you, I did.
And lucky for me, too,

127
00:13:43,807 --> 00:13:47,435
'cause now you're alive and
you can write more books.

128
00:13:48,478 --> 00:13:50,938
Oh, Paul, I've read
everything of yours.

129
00:13:51,023 --> 00:13:53,733
The Misery novels.
I know 'em all by heart.

130
00:13:53,817 --> 00:13:57,278
All eight of 'em.
I love them so.

131
00:13:57,362 --> 00:13:58,905
Well, you're very kind.

132
00:13:58,989 --> 00:14:00,740
And you're very brilliant.

133
00:14:02,451 --> 00:14:05,453
Like a baby. All done.

134
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:07,580
Thank you.

135
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:11,167
When do you think the phone lines'll be up?
I have to call my daughter,

136
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:12,835
and I'd like to call
my agent in New York

137
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,712
and let her know
I'm still breathing.

138
00:14:14,796 --> 00:14:16,631
It shouldn't be
too much longer now.

139
00:14:16,715 --> 00:14:19,926
Once the roads are open, the
phone lines'll be up in no time.

140
00:14:20,010 --> 00:14:22,261
If you give me their numbers,
I'll keep tryin' them for you.

141
00:14:22,346 --> 00:14:24,347
Thank you.

142
00:14:25,515 --> 00:14:27,558
Could I ask you a favor?

143
00:14:30,062 --> 00:14:34,690
I noticed in your case there's
a new Paul Sheldon book, and

144
00:14:34,775 --> 00:14:36,776
I wondered if maybe...

145
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,527
You want to read it?

146
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:40,404
Well, if you wouldn't mind.

147
00:14:41,448 --> 00:14:43,658
Well, I do have a very
hard-and-fast rule as to

148
00:14:43,742 --> 00:14:45,868
who reads my stuff
at this early stage.

149
00:14:46,787 --> 00:14:49,121
Only my editor, my agent,

150
00:14:49,206 --> 00:14:53,167
and anybody that saves me from
freezing to death in a car wreck.

151
00:15:00,384 --> 00:15:03,886
You'll never realize what a
rare treat you've given me.

152
00:15:06,348 --> 00:15:10,309
Boy, it's like clockwork
the way your pain comes.

153
00:15:10,394 --> 00:15:11,852
I'll get you
your Novril, Paul.

154
00:15:11,937 --> 00:15:15,314
Forgive me for prattling away
and making you feel all oogy.

155
00:15:20,070 --> 00:15:22,738
What's your
new book called?

156
00:15:22,823 --> 00:15:25,032
I don't have a title yet.

157
00:15:25,117 --> 00:15:27,159
What's it about?

158
00:15:27,911 --> 00:15:29,662
I don't know.

159
00:15:29,746 --> 00:15:32,832
I know it sounds crazy, but
I haven't written anything

160
00:15:32,916 --> 00:15:34,959
but Misery for so long.

161
00:15:35,043 --> 00:15:38,337
Why don't you read it,
and you can tell me

162
00:15:38,422 --> 00:15:39,714
what you think it's about?

163
00:15:39,798 --> 00:15:41,882
Maybe you can
come up with a title.

164
00:15:42,968 --> 00:15:44,760
Like I could do that!

165
00:15:47,931 --> 00:15:51,308
There's nothin' unusual about
Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster.

166
00:15:51,393 --> 00:15:53,185
You can tell
by the champagne.

167
00:15:53,270 --> 00:15:54,520
Maybe you can, Libby.

168
00:15:54,604 --> 00:15:57,398
No, see, he always orders
a bottle of Dom Pérignon

169
00:15:57,482 --> 00:15:58,816
when he's ready to go.

170
00:15:58,900 --> 00:16:01,027
Then he pays up
and he's out the door.

171
00:16:01,111 --> 00:16:05,406
No long-distance phone calls
or Federal Express packages?

172
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,700
Anything out
of the ordinary?

173
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:09,702
I don't think
Mr. Sheldon likes

174
00:16:09,786 --> 00:16:12,246
for things to be
out of the ordinary.

175
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:15,958
Considering who he is
and all, famous and all,

176
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,794
he doesn't put on airs.

177
00:16:18,879 --> 00:16:24,216
Drives up from New York in the
same car each time, a '65 Mustang.

178
00:16:24,301 --> 00:16:26,302
He says it helps him
to think.

179
00:16:27,512 --> 00:16:29,180
He's always
been a good guest.

180
00:16:29,264 --> 00:16:31,932
Never makes a noise,
never bothers a soul.

181
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:34,602
I sure hope nothing's
happened to him.

182
00:16:34,686 --> 00:16:35,895
So do I.

183
00:16:36,438 --> 00:16:40,107
I bet that old Mustang is pulling
into New York right now.

184
00:16:41,193 --> 00:16:43,486
I'm sure you're right.
Thanks, Libby.

185
00:16:43,570 --> 00:16:45,029
My pleasure.

186
00:16:58,835 --> 00:17:02,546
I know I'm only 40 pages
into your book, but...

187
00:17:04,341 --> 00:17:06,342
But what?

188
00:17:07,552 --> 00:17:09,970
Nothing.

189
00:17:10,055 --> 00:17:12,306
What is it?

190
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:14,183
Well, it's ridiculous.

191
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:16,811
Who am I to make a criticism
to someone like you?

192
00:17:16,895 --> 00:17:19,230
It's all right,
I can take it.

193
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,901
Well, it's
brilliantly written.

194
00:17:23,985 --> 00:17:26,570
But then everything
you write is brilliant.

195
00:17:26,655 --> 00:17:28,614
Pretty rough so far?

196
00:17:30,367 --> 00:17:32,284
The swearing, Paul.

197
00:17:34,371 --> 00:17:36,205
There, I said it.

198
00:17:37,082 --> 00:17:39,834
The... The profanity
bothers you?

199
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:42,336
It has no nobility.

200
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:46,841
These are slum kids.
I was a slum kid.

201
00:17:46,925 --> 00:17:48,342
Everybody talks like that.

202
00:17:48,426 --> 00:17:50,594
They do not!

203
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:52,972
What do you think I say when I
go to the feed store in town?

204
00:17:53,056 --> 00:17:56,600
"Now, Wally, give me a bag
of that F-ing pig feed

205
00:17:56,685 --> 00:17:59,395
"and 10 pounds of that
bitchly cow corn"?

206
00:17:59,479 --> 00:18:02,314
And in the bank,
do I tell Mrs. Bollinger,

207
00:18:02,399 --> 00:18:04,233
"Here's one big bastard
of a check,

208
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:06,318
"give me some of your
Christing money"?

209
00:18:06,403 --> 00:18:09,822
There! Look there!
See what you made me do?

210
00:18:14,703 --> 00:18:17,204
Paul, I'm sorry.

211
00:18:17,289 --> 00:18:18,914
I'm so sorry.

212
00:18:24,212 --> 00:18:28,632
Sometimes I get so worked up.
Can you ever forgive me?

213
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:32,136
It's fine.

214
00:18:38,101 --> 00:18:40,102
I love you, Paul.

215
00:18:43,773 --> 00:18:48,027
Your mind. Your creativity.
That's all I meant.

216
00:19:28,610 --> 00:19:30,569
Well, this sure is fun.

217
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:44,166
Virginia, when
you're in this car

218
00:19:44,251 --> 00:19:46,085
you're not my wife,
you're my deputy.

219
00:19:48,171 --> 00:19:49,630
Well, this deputy'd
rather be home

220
00:19:49,714 --> 00:19:52,466
under the covers
with the sheriff.

221
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:56,345
- Stop. Stop.
- What? What?

222
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:10,276
See that broken limb?

223
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,027
Could've been
the weight of the snow.

224
00:20:12,112 --> 00:20:15,447
Yeah? Could've been a rotten
branch, could've been the wind,

225
00:20:15,532 --> 00:20:17,825
could've been
a lot of things.

226
00:20:50,525 --> 00:20:51,567
Damn!

227
00:20:52,569 --> 00:20:54,611
Need some help?

228
00:20:55,322 --> 00:20:58,615
No, I'm enjoyin' myself!
Thank you.

229
00:21:20,180 --> 00:21:22,348
You really think
Sheldon's out there?

230
00:21:22,432 --> 00:21:25,309
I hope not.
If he is, he's dead.

231
00:21:26,478 --> 00:21:28,937
Let's go to
the newspaper office.

232
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,931
I hope I didn't wake you.

233
00:22:05,058 --> 00:22:06,767
No, that's fine.

234
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:12,481
Look what I got. They had
it at the store, Paul.

235
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,066
There was a whole batch
of 'em there,

236
00:22:14,150 --> 00:22:17,653
and as soon as I saw it I slammed my
money down. I got the first copy.

237
00:22:18,571 --> 00:22:19,863
Then the roads are open.

238
00:22:19,948 --> 00:22:22,408
Well, the one to town is,
but that's about it.

239
00:22:22,492 --> 00:22:26,412
I called the hospital and I talked
to the head orthopedic surgeon

240
00:22:26,496 --> 00:22:29,581
and I told him who you were
and what had happened.

241
00:22:29,666 --> 00:22:34,336
He said as long as there's no
infection you're not in any danger,

242
00:22:34,421 --> 00:22:36,505
and as soon as the road
to the hospital is open,

243
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:39,049
they'll send
an ambulance for you.

244
00:22:39,134 --> 00:22:41,343
The phone's working?

245
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:46,098
Well, mine's still out, but the ones
in town were working just fine.

246
00:22:46,182 --> 00:22:47,933
I called that
agent of yours.

247
00:22:48,017 --> 00:22:51,228
Paul, I peeked at
the very beginning.

248
00:22:51,312 --> 00:22:53,355
What a wonderful
first page.

249
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,773
Just to read the name
Misery Chastain...

250
00:22:54,858 --> 00:22:56,191
My daughter's gotta
be goin' nuts.

251
00:22:56,276 --> 00:22:58,444
It's like a visit from my
oldest, dearest friend.

252
00:22:58,528 --> 00:23:02,781
I mean, I'm supposed to be home
for her birthday. It's today.

253
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:05,409
The agent said she would
tell her you were okay,

254
00:23:05,493 --> 00:23:07,161
but I'm afraid you'll have
to wait till tomorrow

255
00:23:07,245 --> 00:23:09,872
if you want to talk
to her yourself.

256
00:23:12,876 --> 00:23:16,545
Oh, Paul.
What a poet you are.

257
00:23:25,847 --> 00:23:29,892
I made you my specialty,
scrambled eggs à la Wilkes.

258
00:23:30,393 --> 00:23:32,227
And I'm on Page 75.

259
00:23:33,563 --> 00:23:35,981
I guess that means
it's okay.

260
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,066
No.

261
00:23:38,568 --> 00:23:40,486
No, it isn't, it's...

262
00:23:41,154 --> 00:23:44,698
Pooh. I can't think
of any words.

263
00:23:44,782 --> 00:23:46,241
Would "great" be insulting?

264
00:23:47,744 --> 00:23:49,786
I can live with great.

265
00:23:50,163 --> 00:23:54,249
No. It's not just great,
it's

266
00:23:56,419 --> 00:23:57,419
perfect.

267
00:23:59,756 --> 00:24:01,840
A perfect, perfect thing.

268
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:51,807
I thought it was time
you two should meet.

269
00:24:52,642 --> 00:24:56,019
Paul, say hello to my favorite
beast in the whole world,

270
00:24:56,104 --> 00:24:57,771
my sow Misery.

271
00:24:59,566 --> 00:25:00,566
Misery?

272
00:25:00,650 --> 00:25:03,318
Yes. I told you I was
your number-one fan.

273
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:07,030
Yeah, I'm... I'm
starting to believe you.

274
00:25:07,115 --> 00:25:08,448
This farm was
kind of dreary,

275
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:10,742
what with just a few cows
and chickens and me.

276
00:25:10,827 --> 00:25:14,288
But when I got Misery
here, everything changed.

277
00:25:14,372 --> 00:25:16,206
She just makes me smile so.

278
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,627
She's a fine pig,
is what she is.

279
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:29,428
I'm on Page 300 now, Paul, and it's
better than perfect. It's divine.

280
00:25:30,597 --> 00:25:32,848
What's the ceiling
that dago painted?

281
00:25:33,933 --> 00:25:35,684
The Sistine Chapel?

282
00:25:35,768 --> 00:25:38,770
Yeah!
That and Misery's Child.

283
00:25:38,855 --> 00:25:42,441
Those are the only two divine
things ever in this world!

284
00:26:00,752 --> 00:26:03,670
When my husband left me,
I wasn't prepared.

285
00:26:05,048 --> 00:26:07,215
It wasn't an easy time.

286
00:26:08,926 --> 00:26:11,928
For a while I thought
I might go crazy.

287
00:26:13,056 --> 00:26:15,474
I know how that can be.

288
00:26:17,602 --> 00:26:20,562
I don't know about you, but
what I did to get through it

289
00:26:20,647 --> 00:26:22,272
was I dove into work.

290
00:26:23,107 --> 00:26:25,400
Days, nights.

291
00:26:26,903 --> 00:26:30,447
Night shifts can be lonely
at a hospital.

292
00:26:30,531 --> 00:26:31,740
I did a lot of reading.

293
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:36,495
That was when I first
discovered Misery.

294
00:26:37,246 --> 00:26:42,250
She made me so happy. She made
me forget all my problems.

295
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:47,506
Course, I suppose you had a little
something to do with that, too.

296
00:26:47,590 --> 00:26:49,591
Yeah, well...

297
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:55,847
I just kept reading
them over and over.

298
00:26:55,932 --> 00:26:57,808
I've only got two chapters
to go on this one,

299
00:26:57,892 --> 00:27:00,477
and I know when I finish I'll
just turn right to the first page

300
00:27:00,561 --> 00:27:03,271
and start reading it
all over again.

301
00:27:04,273 --> 00:27:05,691
I'm...

302
00:27:09,195 --> 00:27:10,987
- Done?
- Yeah.

303
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:12,447
No problem.

304
00:27:14,617 --> 00:27:16,201
Thanks.

305
00:27:16,285 --> 00:27:19,705
Don't get me wrong. I'm not
against marriage per se,

306
00:27:19,789 --> 00:27:22,249
but it'd take a pretty
special guy to make me

307
00:27:22,333 --> 00:27:24,793
want to walk down
that aisle again.

308
00:27:24,877 --> 00:27:28,380
Yeah, it's not something you
should enter into lightly.

309
00:27:28,464 --> 00:27:30,882
It boils down to respect.

310
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:34,219
People just don't respect the
institution of marriage anymore.

311
00:27:34,303 --> 00:27:36,972
They have no sense
of real commitment.

312
00:27:39,767 --> 00:27:42,102
Well, I'd love to
stay here and chat,

313
00:27:42,186 --> 00:27:45,981
but I'm right at the end, and I
gotta find out what happens.

314
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,087
You...

315
00:28:12,008 --> 00:28:16,094
You dirty bird.
How could you?

316
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:23,310
She can't be dead! Misery
Chastain cannot be dead!

317
00:28:23,936 --> 00:28:27,063
Annie, in 1871, women
often died in childbirth.

318
00:28:28,149 --> 00:28:29,524
But her spirit
is the important thing,

319
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:31,526
and Misery's spirit
is still alive.

320
00:28:31,611 --> 00:28:35,280
I don't want her spirit!
I want her!

321
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:37,491
And you murdered her!

322
00:28:37,575 --> 00:28:40,160
No. I didn't.

323
00:28:40,244 --> 00:28:41,828
Who did?

324
00:28:41,913 --> 00:28:46,082
No one. She died,
she just slipped away.

325
00:28:46,167 --> 00:28:50,170
Slipped away? Slipped away?

326
00:28:50,254 --> 00:28:53,006
She didn't just slip away!
You did it!

327
00:28:55,092 --> 00:28:57,302
You did it! You did it!

328
00:28:57,386 --> 00:29:01,473
You did it! You did it!
You murdered my Misery!

329
00:29:01,557 --> 00:29:02,557
Annie!

330
00:29:07,563 --> 00:29:10,232
I thought
you were good, Paul.

331
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:14,903
But you're not good. You're just
another lying old dirty birdie.

332
00:29:15,571 --> 00:29:18,990
And I don't think I better
be around you for a while.

333
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:30,752
And don't even think about
anybody coming for you.

334
00:29:30,837 --> 00:29:35,799
Not the doctors, not your
agent, not your family,

335
00:29:35,883 --> 00:29:37,342
because I never called them.

336
00:29:38,261 --> 00:29:40,679
Nobody knows you're here.

337
00:29:40,763 --> 00:29:43,682
And you better hope
nothing happens to me.

338
00:29:44,433 --> 00:29:47,519
Because if I die,
you die.

339
00:32:16,252 --> 00:32:20,296
No, Miss Sindell, there's
no point in comin' up here now.

340
00:32:20,381 --> 00:32:22,799
Everything that
can be done is.

341
00:32:24,093 --> 00:32:26,511
Yes, we're working close
with the state police

342
00:32:26,595 --> 00:32:28,888
and the FBI's
been informed.

343
00:32:28,973 --> 00:32:33,727
Right. Right. As soon as we know
anything, we'll let you know.

344
00:32:34,270 --> 00:32:38,440
No bother at all. Call anytime.
Bye, Miss Sindell.

345
00:32:39,734 --> 00:32:43,236
All right. Well, I sure
appreciate it. Thank you.

346
00:32:45,531 --> 00:32:47,991
According to the check on
Sheldon's credit charges,

347
00:32:48,075 --> 00:32:50,285
there's nothing
after the Silver Creek.

348
00:32:50,995 --> 00:32:53,705
And no calls about
the article, either.

349
00:32:56,751 --> 00:33:01,337
You poor, dear thing. What
are you doing on the floor?

350
00:33:02,548 --> 00:33:04,674
It's all my fault.

351
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:08,470
If I'd had a proper hospital bed
this never would've happened.

352
00:33:08,554 --> 00:33:10,889
Here, let me
help you back in.

353
00:33:13,893 --> 00:33:17,812
I know this hurts, but it'll
only take a few seconds.

354
00:33:18,481 --> 00:33:21,399
Upsy-daisy!

355
00:33:26,822 --> 00:33:28,198
Please, wait.

356
00:33:28,282 --> 00:33:29,991
You're such a crybaby.

357
00:33:37,541 --> 00:33:40,043
There you go. Comfy?

358
00:33:40,628 --> 00:33:41,753
Perfect.

359
00:33:41,837 --> 00:33:44,047
You're such a kidder.

360
00:33:44,131 --> 00:33:46,382
I have a big surprise
for you.

361
00:33:46,467 --> 00:33:48,927
But first there's
something you must do.

362
00:33:49,345 --> 00:33:52,138
You don't suppose
I could have a little snack

363
00:33:52,223 --> 00:33:54,182
while I'm waiting
for the surprise?

364
00:33:54,266 --> 00:33:57,811
I'll get you everything you want,
but you must listen first.

365
00:33:58,687 --> 00:34:02,398
Sometimes my thinking is a
little muddy, I accept that.

366
00:34:02,483 --> 00:34:03,483
That's why
I couldn't remember

367
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:04,984
all the things
they were asking me

368
00:34:05,069 --> 00:34:07,403
on the witness stand
in Denver.

369
00:34:08,072 --> 00:34:09,906
But this time
I thought clearly.

370
00:34:10,533 --> 00:34:12,283
I asked God about you,

371
00:34:12,368 --> 00:34:14,077
and God said,
"I delivered him unto you

372
00:34:14,161 --> 00:34:16,454
"so that you may
show him the way."

373
00:34:16,872 --> 00:34:18,790
Show me the way?

374
00:34:18,874 --> 00:34:20,041
Yes.

375
00:34:53,450 --> 00:34:54,534
When I mentioned a snack,

376
00:34:54,618 --> 00:34:56,161
I was thinking
more along the lines

377
00:34:56,245 --> 00:34:59,080
of cheese and crackers
kind of thing.

378
00:34:59,165 --> 00:35:02,542
Paul, this is
no time for jokes.

379
00:35:02,626 --> 00:35:05,253
You must rid the world
of this filth.

380
00:35:07,673 --> 00:35:09,883
You want me to burn my book?

381
00:35:09,967 --> 00:35:13,928
I know this may be difficult for
you, but it's for the best.

382
00:35:17,183 --> 00:35:20,059
It's really
not difficult at all.

383
00:35:20,144 --> 00:35:21,644
My agent made
dozens of copies.

384
00:35:21,729 --> 00:35:23,980
There's gonna be
an auction in New York.

385
00:35:24,064 --> 00:35:26,608
Every publishing house in
New York is reading it now.

386
00:35:26,692 --> 00:35:28,985
So if you want me
to burn my book, fine.

387
00:35:29,069 --> 00:35:31,946
You're not really ridding
the world of anything.

388
00:35:32,656 --> 00:35:34,574
Then light the match, Paul.

389
00:35:35,075 --> 00:35:37,202
It's no big deal.

390
00:35:37,286 --> 00:35:40,580
So you've indicated. Do it.

391
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:52,175
I know this is
the only copy, Paul.

392
00:35:52,259 --> 00:35:54,636
When you were 24 you wrote your first
book, and you didn't make a copy

393
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,096
because you didn't think anybody
would take it seriously.

394
00:35:57,181 --> 00:35:59,432
But they did. And ever since
you've never made any copies

395
00:35:59,516 --> 00:36:00,892
because you're
superstitious.

396
00:36:00,976 --> 00:36:03,228
It's why you always come back
to the Silver Creek Lodge.

397
00:36:03,312 --> 00:36:06,481
You told that story to Merv
Griffin 11 years ago.

398
00:36:09,485 --> 00:36:10,735
Merv Griffin.

399
00:36:14,281 --> 00:36:17,825
I'll tell you what. It doesn't
ever have to be published.

400
00:36:17,910 --> 00:36:18,993
No one ever has to read it.

401
00:36:19,286 --> 00:36:21,079
I'll just keep it for myself.

402
00:36:21,163 --> 00:36:23,331
No one will even
know it exists.

403
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:28,336
As long as it does exist,
your mind won't ever be free.

404
00:36:32,591 --> 00:36:35,301
I think you should
light the match, Paul.

405
00:36:44,019 --> 00:36:46,771
Can't you see
it's what God wants?

406
00:36:46,855 --> 00:36:47,939
You're so brilliant,

407
00:36:48,023 --> 00:36:50,900
I would think you'd certainly
be able to see that.

408
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:57,073
We're put on this earth
to help people, Paul.

409
00:36:57,157 --> 00:36:59,909
Like I'm trying
to help you.

410
00:37:00,953 --> 00:37:04,872
Please. Help me help you.

411
00:37:23,267 --> 00:37:25,393
You're doing the right thing.

412
00:37:34,361 --> 00:37:38,239
My goodness! Goodness gracious!
Oh, my.

413
00:37:43,078 --> 00:37:46,164
Goodness!
Heavens to Betsy!

414
00:37:46,248 --> 00:37:49,000
Oh, my goodness!
Oh, my goodness!

415
00:37:50,919 --> 00:37:54,088
Heavens to Betsy!
Oh, goodness!

416
00:38:13,233 --> 00:38:15,485
Well, isn't that
an oogy mess?

417
00:38:37,633 --> 00:38:40,093
That's the Steadman place
down there.

418
00:38:40,844 --> 00:38:43,429
And that's the Wilkes farm
straight ahead.

419
00:38:46,809 --> 00:38:48,935
That's no '65 Mustang.

420
00:38:50,813 --> 00:38:53,815
There's nothing else out this way.
Let's... Let's circle back.

421
00:39:07,454 --> 00:39:08,746
I do believe
the winters are getting

422
00:39:08,831 --> 00:39:11,207
shorter and shorter
every year.

423
00:39:11,291 --> 00:39:15,128
People say it has something
to do with the ozone layer.

424
00:39:15,212 --> 00:39:16,254
What do you think?

425
00:39:17,798 --> 00:39:19,632
I don't know.

426
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,343
Yeah, well, it's a theory.

427
00:39:30,853 --> 00:39:32,687
Here's your Novril.

428
00:40:11,143 --> 00:40:12,393
All right. We're back.

429
00:40:12,478 --> 00:40:14,061
Now, you're gonna have to remind
us who the audience chose.

430
00:40:14,188 --> 00:40:16,522
- They chose Kevin.
- They chose Kevin.

431
00:40:18,525 --> 00:40:20,526
- Hi, Kevin.
- Hi. How you doin', Chuck?

432
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:22,403
Fine. Make yourself
at home back there,

433
00:40:22,488 --> 00:40:25,156
and Sheree will tell us
about the date.

434
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:29,076
Okay. First of all, I picked
out a very classy restaurant.

435
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:33,456
It was so classy, and he
shows up without no tie...

436
00:41:32,266 --> 00:41:34,308
See, isn't this nice?

437
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:37,895
Great. I always wanted to visit
the other side of the room.

438
00:41:37,980 --> 00:41:40,565
And look what
I got for you.

439
00:41:42,067 --> 00:41:45,528
An electric razor, so you
can shave yourself now.

440
00:41:49,908 --> 00:41:52,910
If I knew this was gonna be the
surprise, I'd have burned all my books.

441
00:41:52,995 --> 00:41:55,454
Now, don't poke fun!

442
00:41:56,748 --> 00:41:58,708
This is a very big
day for you, Paul.

443
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:01,794
You just sit tight and
I'll set everything up.

444
00:42:02,963 --> 00:42:04,338
Set what up?

445
00:42:04,423 --> 00:42:06,048
That's the
big surprise.

446
00:42:06,842 --> 00:42:08,676
Your new studio.

447
00:42:09,678 --> 00:42:13,097
After all, writers
do need a place to work.

448
00:42:13,181 --> 00:42:15,683
Work? You mean write?

449
00:42:17,686 --> 00:42:19,770
What in the world
do you think I'd write?

450
00:42:19,855 --> 00:42:23,482
Paul, I don't think.
I know.

451
00:42:24,192 --> 00:42:26,527
Now that you've gotten rid
of that nasty manuscript,

452
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:29,614
you can go back to doing
what you're great at.

453
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:31,324
You're gonna write
a new novel,

454
00:42:31,408 --> 00:42:33,701
your greatest
achievement ever.

455
00:42:33,785 --> 00:42:35,536
Misery's Return.

456
00:42:36,622 --> 00:42:38,247
Misery's Return?

457
00:42:38,999 --> 00:42:41,417
I know you didn't mean it
when you killed her,

458
00:42:41,501 --> 00:42:43,586
and now
you'll make it right.

459
00:42:45,088 --> 00:42:47,465
It'll be a book
in my honor,

460
00:42:47,549 --> 00:42:50,217
for saving your life and
nursing you back to health.

461
00:42:50,927 --> 00:42:55,348
Paul, you're gonna make me
the envy of the whole world!

462
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:58,893
You just expect me to whip
something off, is that it?

463
00:42:58,977 --> 00:43:02,063
I expect nothing less
than your masterpiece.

464
00:43:04,191 --> 00:43:07,860
You do understand that this
is not the ordinary way

465
00:43:07,944 --> 00:43:09,403
in which books get written.

466
00:43:09,488 --> 00:43:13,157
I mean, some people might actually
consider this an oddball situation.

467
00:43:13,241 --> 00:43:15,826
I have total confidence
in your brilliance.

468
00:43:15,911 --> 00:43:18,204
Besides, the view
will inspire you.

469
00:43:18,914 --> 00:43:21,707
You just inhale that.
I'll be right back.

470
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:36,180
I guess you don't get
bothered by neighbors much.

471
00:43:36,264 --> 00:43:37,973
Don't you
worry about that,

472
00:43:38,058 --> 00:43:41,644
you'll have total solitude so you
can concentrate on your work.

473
00:43:41,728 --> 00:43:42,937
Great.

474
00:43:44,648 --> 00:43:47,566
I got you this expensive
paper to type on,

475
00:43:47,651 --> 00:43:49,902
and I got a great deal
on this 50-pound clunker,

476
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:52,321
on account of
its missing an "N."

477
00:43:52,406 --> 00:43:54,865
I told the saleslady
"N" was one of the letters

478
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,534
in my favorite writer's name.

479
00:43:59,454 --> 00:44:04,458
It's two of the letters in my
favorite nurse's name, A-nn-ie.

480
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,838
You fooler! Did I do good?

481
00:44:08,922 --> 00:44:10,464
You did great.

482
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:16,137
There is just
one little thing.

483
00:44:19,182 --> 00:44:24,562
I can't work on this paper. See,
it's Corrasable Bond. It smudges.

484
00:44:24,646 --> 00:44:28,441
So I thought maybe,
if you went back into town,

485
00:44:28,525 --> 00:44:31,986
you could bring me
some white long-grain mimeo.

486
00:44:33,321 --> 00:44:37,241
But mine cost the most, so I
don't see how it can smudge.

487
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,286
Come here, I'll show you.

488
00:44:59,097 --> 00:45:03,684
It does smudge, after all.
Isn't that fascinating.

489
00:45:04,186 --> 00:45:06,437
I thought
you'd be interested.

490
00:45:06,521 --> 00:45:09,106
I'd like for you to be
in on everything, Annie.

491
00:45:09,191 --> 00:45:12,318
Not just the finished book,
but how it's written.

492
00:45:13,612 --> 00:45:15,821
Thank you
for thinking of me.

493
00:45:20,118 --> 00:45:22,953
Anything else I can get
while I'm in town?

494
00:45:23,371 --> 00:45:26,540
Any other crucial requirements
that need satisfying?

495
00:45:26,625 --> 00:45:28,918
Would you like
a tiny tape recorder?

496
00:45:29,002 --> 00:45:31,629
Or how about a handmade set
of writing slippers?

497
00:45:31,713 --> 00:45:34,340
No, just the paper
will be fine.

498
00:45:34,966 --> 00:45:36,217
Are you sure?

499
00:45:36,301 --> 00:45:39,553
'Cause if you want, I'll bring
back the whole store for you.

500
00:45:39,763 --> 00:45:42,723
Annie, what's the matter?

501
00:45:42,808 --> 00:45:45,309
What's the matter? I'll
tell you what's the matter!

502
00:45:45,393 --> 00:45:47,019
I go out of my way for you!

503
00:45:47,103 --> 00:45:48,896
I do everything to try
and make you happy!

504
00:45:48,980 --> 00:45:52,942
I feed you, I clean you, I dress
you, and what thanks do I get?

505
00:45:53,026 --> 00:45:54,568
"You bought
the wrong paper, Annie.

506
00:45:54,653 --> 00:45:56,445
"I can't write on
this paper, Annie!"

507
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:57,822
Well, I'll get
your stupid paper,

508
00:45:57,906 --> 00:45:59,198
but you just better
start showing me

509
00:45:59,282 --> 00:46:01,909
a little more appreciation
around here, Mister Man!

510
00:47:31,082 --> 00:47:32,583
Shit.

511
00:47:54,689 --> 00:47:57,524
Come on, you've written
about this, now do it.

512
00:48:05,825 --> 00:48:08,410
What do you know?
It actually works.

513
00:48:39,567 --> 00:48:41,568
What a surprise.

514
00:49:21,401 --> 00:49:23,235
You crazy bitch.

515
00:54:49,812 --> 00:54:52,105
Paul, I've got your paper.

516
00:54:52,774 --> 00:54:56,610
I hope it's enough. It's three
reams of long-grain mimeo.

517
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:59,029
Just the kind you asked for.

518
00:55:00,490 --> 00:55:04,701
Paul, you're dripping
with perspiration.

519
00:55:05,286 --> 00:55:08,747
Your color is very hectic.
What have you been doing?

520
00:55:08,831 --> 00:55:11,708
You know damn well
what I've been doing.

521
00:55:11,793 --> 00:55:13,543
I've been
sitting here suffering.

522
00:55:13,628 --> 00:55:16,046
I need my pills.

523
00:55:16,130 --> 00:55:19,925
Poor dear. Let's get you back in
bed and I'll get them for you.

524
00:55:20,009 --> 00:55:21,760
I want my pills now!

525
00:55:21,844 --> 00:55:22,844
It'll only take a second.

526
00:55:22,929 --> 00:55:24,054
No!

527
00:55:24,889 --> 00:55:28,266
I want my pain
to go away, Annie.

528
00:55:29,477 --> 00:55:32,020
Please, make it go away.

529
00:55:33,356 --> 00:55:37,234
Please, Annie. Please.

530
00:55:40,988 --> 00:55:43,907
It just breaks my heart
to see you like this.

531
00:55:54,085 --> 00:55:56,336
I've done a lot
of thinking on the drive.

532
00:55:56,421 --> 00:55:57,671
Here you go.

533
00:55:58,631 --> 00:56:02,592
And I'm absolutely certain the main
reason I've never been more popular

534
00:56:02,677 --> 00:56:04,886
is because of my temper.

535
00:56:04,971 --> 00:56:08,682
You must be so mad at me.
The truth, now.

536
00:56:10,226 --> 00:56:14,521
Well... Who doesn't let off a
little steam every once in a while?

537
00:56:16,190 --> 00:56:19,109
My genius needs his rest
before he writes.

538
00:56:25,032 --> 00:56:26,533
Footsies up.

539
00:56:27,869 --> 00:56:29,327
There you go.

540
00:56:42,550 --> 00:56:46,595
Here. In case you think
of any ideas.

541
00:56:47,638 --> 00:56:49,890
Well, I wouldn't
expect too much.

542
00:56:50,641 --> 00:56:53,977
Don't be silly!
You'll be brilliant.

543
00:56:54,061 --> 00:56:55,896
Think of me as
your inspiration.

544
00:57:01,068 --> 00:57:03,361
I have faith in you,
my darling.

545
00:57:03,988 --> 00:57:05,405
Catch this.

546
00:57:16,417 --> 00:57:17,959
"My darling."

547
00:57:49,784 --> 00:57:53,870
The presumption must now be
that Paul Sheldon is dead.

548
00:57:53,955 --> 00:57:57,040
We know that he somehow managed
to crawl outside his vehicle,

549
00:57:57,124 --> 00:57:59,125
but we have been unable
to find his body

550
00:57:59,210 --> 00:58:01,294
anywhere in the vicinity
of the accident.

551
00:58:01,379 --> 00:58:03,213
We also know that
if anyone had found him

552
00:58:03,297 --> 00:58:06,091
they would have taken him
to an area hospital.

553
00:58:06,175 --> 00:58:09,177
Undoubtedly he is buried
somewhere out there in the snow.

554
00:58:10,012 --> 00:58:12,055
We'll find him
after the first thaw.

555
00:58:12,139 --> 00:58:14,015
That is, unless the animals
didn't get to him first,

556
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:15,600
which is
a distinct possibility.

557
00:58:15,685 --> 00:58:16,851
Local papers...

558
00:58:17,144 --> 00:58:20,063
That was a statement from Colorado
Police Chief Sherman Douglas.

559
00:58:20,147 --> 00:58:21,398
The whereabouts of famed
novelist Paul Sheldon is...

560
00:58:21,482 --> 00:58:23,900
We will be updating
you with the latest...

561
00:58:32,326 --> 00:58:34,411
You don't think
he's dead, do you?

562
00:58:34,495 --> 00:58:38,123
Well, he might well be,
but not the way they say.

563
00:58:38,207 --> 00:58:41,042
He never crawled out of
that car by himself.

564
00:58:41,127 --> 00:58:43,628
You can see the dents
on the door there.

565
00:58:43,713 --> 00:58:45,672
Someone pulled him out.

566
01:00:38,119 --> 01:00:40,620
I'm sorry, Paul.
This is all wrong.

567
01:00:40,705 --> 01:00:41,705
What?

568
01:00:41,789 --> 01:00:43,373
You'll have to
do it over again.

569
01:00:43,457 --> 01:00:45,875
It's not worthy of you.
Throw it all out.

570
01:00:45,960 --> 01:00:48,002
Except for that part of naming
the gravedigger after me.

571
01:00:48,087 --> 01:00:49,963
You can leave that in.

572
01:00:51,799 --> 01:00:54,551
I really value
your criticism,

573
01:00:54,635 --> 01:00:56,386
but maybe we're being
a little hasty here.

574
01:00:56,470 --> 01:00:59,264
Paul, what you've written
just isn't fair.

575
01:00:59,348 --> 01:01:00,390
Not fair?

576
01:01:00,474 --> 01:01:01,516
That's right.

577
01:01:01,809 --> 01:01:03,268
When I was growing
up in Bakersfield,

578
01:01:03,352 --> 01:01:04,728
my favorite thing
in all the world

579
01:01:04,812 --> 01:01:07,731
was to go to the movies on Saturday
afternoons for the chapter plays.

580
01:01:07,815 --> 01:01:09,023
Cliffhangers.

581
01:01:09,108 --> 01:01:10,900
I know that, Mister Man!

582
01:01:10,985 --> 01:01:14,654
They also call them serials.
I'm not stupid, you know!

583
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,076
Anyway, my favorite
was Rocketman,

584
01:01:20,161 --> 01:01:22,036
and once it was
a no-brakes chapter,

585
01:01:22,121 --> 01:01:24,247
and the bad guys stuck him
in a car on a mountain road,

586
01:01:24,331 --> 01:01:26,082
and knocked him out
and welded the doors shut

587
01:01:26,167 --> 01:01:28,293
and tore out the brakes
and started him to his death.

588
01:01:28,377 --> 01:01:30,962
And he woke up and tried to
steer and tried to get out,

589
01:01:31,046 --> 01:01:33,339
but the car went off a cliff
before he could escape,

590
01:01:33,424 --> 01:01:34,632
and it crashed and burned

591
01:01:34,717 --> 01:01:36,551
and I was so upset
and excited!

592
01:01:36,635 --> 01:01:39,095
And the next week, you better
believe I was first in line.

593
01:01:39,180 --> 01:01:41,264
And they always start with
the end of the last week,

594
01:01:41,348 --> 01:01:43,600
and there was Rocketman,
trying to get out,

595
01:01:43,684 --> 01:01:45,185
and here comes the cliff,

596
01:01:45,269 --> 01:01:48,563
and just before the car went
off the cliff he jumped free,

597
01:01:48,647 --> 01:01:50,356
and all the kids cheered!

598
01:01:51,025 --> 01:01:54,819
But I didn't cheer. I stood
right up and started shouting,

599
01:01:54,904 --> 01:01:56,821
"This isn't what
happened last week!

600
01:01:56,906 --> 01:01:58,782
Have you all got amnesia?

601
01:01:58,866 --> 01:02:01,785
"They just cheated us!
This isn't fair!

602
01:02:01,869 --> 01:02:05,663
"He didn't get out
of the cockadoodie car!"

603
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:15,799
They always cheated like
that in chapter plays.

604
01:02:15,883 --> 01:02:20,345
But not you.
Not with my Misery.

605
01:02:20,429 --> 01:02:22,388
Remember Ian did ride
for Dr. Cleary

606
01:02:22,473 --> 01:02:24,808
at the end of the last book, but
his horse fell jumping that fence,

607
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:27,310
and Ian broke his shoulder and his
ribs and lay all night in the ditch

608
01:02:27,394 --> 01:02:28,728
and he never reached
the doctor,

609
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,147
so there couldn't have been any
experimental blood transfusion

610
01:02:31,232 --> 01:02:33,066
that saved her life.

611
01:02:33,192 --> 01:02:35,652
Misery was buried in the
ground at the end, Paul,

612
01:02:35,736 --> 01:02:38,071
so you'll have
to start there.

613
01:03:18,028 --> 01:03:21,030
Is it fair?
Should I continue?

614
01:03:22,324 --> 01:03:24,200
You better!

615
01:03:24,285 --> 01:03:27,370
Oh, Paul!
When Ian realized that

616
01:03:27,454 --> 01:03:28,872
the reason they'd
buried Misery alive

617
01:03:28,956 --> 01:03:31,624
was because the bee sting had
put her in that temporary coma!

618
01:03:31,709 --> 01:03:34,878
And when Gravedigger Wilkes
remembered how 30 years earlier

619
01:03:34,962 --> 01:03:37,130
the same thing had happened
to Lady Evelyn-Hyde!

620
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:40,258
And then old Dr. Cleary
deduced that Misery

621
01:03:40,342 --> 01:03:42,385
must be Lady Evelyn-Hyde's
long-lost daughter

622
01:03:42,469 --> 01:03:46,347
because of the rarity of deadly
bee stings, my heart just leapt!

623
01:03:46,432 --> 01:03:47,891
I've known from
the very first book

624
01:03:47,975 --> 01:03:49,559
that Misery had to
be born of nobility

625
01:03:49,643 --> 01:03:51,019
and I was right!

626
01:03:51,103 --> 01:03:52,103
Yeah.

627
01:03:52,187 --> 01:03:54,397
Paul, can I read each chapter
when you're finished?

628
01:03:54,481 --> 01:03:56,691
I can fill in the "N's."

629
01:03:57,526 --> 01:03:59,944
Will she be her old self
now that Ian has dug her out,

630
01:04:00,029 --> 01:04:01,404
or will she have amnesia?

631
01:04:01,488 --> 01:04:02,655
Have to wait.

632
01:04:02,740 --> 01:04:05,867
Will she still love him with
that special, perfect love?

633
01:04:05,951 --> 01:04:07,368
You'll have to wait.

634
01:04:07,453 --> 01:04:08,745
Not even a hint?

635
01:04:08,829 --> 01:04:09,954
Uh-uh.

636
01:04:11,332 --> 01:04:15,919
Misery's alive, Misery's alive!
It's so romantic!

637
01:04:16,003 --> 01:04:19,255
This whole house is gonna
be filled with romance!

638
01:04:19,340 --> 01:04:21,549
I'm gonna put on
my Liberace records!

639
01:04:26,013 --> 01:04:28,598
You do like Liberace,
don't you?

640
01:04:28,974 --> 01:04:30,099
Whenever he played
Radio City,

641
01:04:30,184 --> 01:04:32,644
who do you think was right
there in the front row?

642
01:04:32,728 --> 01:04:35,813
I'm gonna play my records
all day long, to inspire you.

643
01:04:35,898 --> 01:04:37,523
He's my all-time favorite.

644
01:04:37,858 --> 01:04:39,108
Annie.

645
01:04:42,279 --> 01:04:44,656
Would you have
dinner with me tonight?

646
01:04:44,740 --> 01:04:46,532
To celebrate Misery's Return.

647
01:04:49,828 --> 01:04:52,455
I couldn't have
done it without you.

648
01:04:54,833 --> 01:04:55,833
Paul.

649
01:04:57,920 --> 01:04:59,796
It would be an honor.

650
01:05:06,845 --> 01:05:08,805
No, he's not here.

651
01:05:08,889 --> 01:05:10,139
I don't know where he is.

652
01:05:10,224 --> 01:05:12,141
He never tells me
anything anymore.

653
01:05:12,226 --> 01:05:15,478
He's probably out
havin' an affair somewhere.

654
01:05:15,562 --> 01:05:17,814
Wait a minute.
He's comin' in now.

655
01:05:17,898 --> 01:05:19,357
It's Jim Taylor.

656
01:05:19,441 --> 01:05:22,193
He wants to know who you're
havin' an affair with.

657
01:05:23,278 --> 01:05:25,405
Hello, Jim.
What's doin'?

658
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:30,576
Jim, we've been
through this before.

659
01:05:30,661 --> 01:05:33,162
If you're gonna have benches
out in front of your store,

660
01:05:33,247 --> 01:05:35,748
people are gonna want
to sit on 'em.

661
01:05:36,750 --> 01:05:37,875
Well, I don't like him,
either,

662
01:05:37,960 --> 01:05:39,544
but I'm not gonna
come over there

663
01:05:39,628 --> 01:05:41,421
and tell him to move.

664
01:05:42,214 --> 01:05:44,757
Give my best to
Denise. Bye.

665
01:05:46,051 --> 01:05:49,470
Well, whoever she is,
she sure likes to read a lot.

666
01:05:50,431 --> 01:05:55,059
Virginia, I'm flattered that you
think I've got that much energy.

667
01:05:56,812 --> 01:05:59,313
I figured that if
I can't find Paul Sheldon,

668
01:05:59,398 --> 01:06:02,275
at least I can find out
what he wrote about.

669
01:06:02,693 --> 01:06:04,027
What do you expect to find?

670
01:06:04,111 --> 01:06:08,197
A story about a guy who drove his
car off a cliff in a snowstorm?

671
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:12,535
You see, it's just
that kind of sarcasm

672
01:06:12,619 --> 01:06:14,746
that's given our marriage
real spice.

673
01:06:29,219 --> 01:06:30,553
I hope you like it.

674
01:06:30,637 --> 01:06:31,971
It looks wonderful.

675
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,058
So do you.

676
01:07:03,670 --> 01:07:07,048
I've never had meatloaf this good.
What do you do to it?

677
01:07:07,132 --> 01:07:10,426
My secret is I only use fresh
tomatoes, never canned.

678
01:07:10,511 --> 01:07:12,095
And to give it
that little extra zip,

679
01:07:12,179 --> 01:07:14,263
I mix in some Spam
with the ground beef.

680
01:07:18,018 --> 01:07:21,020
Can't get this in a
restaurant in New York.

681
01:07:28,278 --> 01:07:29,612
Let's have a toast.

682
01:07:29,696 --> 01:07:30,738
A toast?

683
01:07:30,823 --> 01:07:33,366
Yes. To Misery.

684
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:34,534
Let me pour you some wine.

685
01:07:52,761 --> 01:07:54,178
To Misery.

686
01:07:58,058 --> 01:08:02,061
Wait. Let's do this right.
Do you have any candles?

687
01:08:04,982 --> 01:08:08,276
I don't know.
I think so.

688
01:08:08,360 --> 01:08:09,944
I'll go look.

689
01:08:17,578 --> 01:08:20,746
Did you study decorating
or do you just have a flair?

690
01:08:20,831 --> 01:08:23,541
Oh, you!

691
01:08:23,625 --> 01:08:26,294
I just picked things up
over the years.

692
01:08:26,879 --> 01:08:28,963
Well,
it certainly says you.

693
01:08:29,047 --> 01:08:31,090
You really think so?

694
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:32,592
Absolutely.

695
01:08:33,802 --> 01:08:35,970
Listen, if you can't
find any, it's okay.

696
01:08:36,054 --> 01:08:38,222
I just thought it'd be nice.

697
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:41,642
Are you kidding? If anyone had
ever told me that one day

698
01:08:41,727 --> 01:08:43,311
I'd be having
a candlelit dinner

699
01:08:43,395 --> 01:08:45,605
with Paul Sheldon
in my own house,

700
01:08:45,689 --> 01:08:46,898
I would have checked
both legs

701
01:08:46,982 --> 01:08:50,109
to see which one
was bein' pulled!

702
01:08:51,820 --> 01:08:53,154
Will this do?

703
01:08:53,739 --> 01:08:55,239
It's perfect.

704
01:09:00,787 --> 01:09:05,458
To Misery and to Annie Wilkes,
who brought her back to life.

705
01:09:06,793 --> 01:09:09,837
Paul, I get goose bumps
every time I think about it!

706
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,800
My God, what have I done?

707
01:09:14,885 --> 01:09:16,844
I'm so sorry, Paul!

708
01:09:17,137 --> 01:09:19,472
I ruined your
beautiful toast!

709
01:09:22,267 --> 01:09:24,310
Will you ever forgive me?

710
01:09:24,895 --> 01:09:27,188
Here, let me
pour another one.

711
01:09:33,320 --> 01:09:36,155
Can we pretend
this never happened?

712
01:09:39,993 --> 01:09:41,661
To Misery.

713
01:09:42,287 --> 01:09:43,663
To Misery.

714
01:10:27,958 --> 01:10:31,919
Paul, this is positively the
best Misery you've ever written.

715
01:11:40,989 --> 01:11:42,823
Here's your pills.

716
01:11:44,618 --> 01:11:45,785
Annie?

717
01:11:49,164 --> 01:11:50,790
Annie, what is it?

718
01:11:52,125 --> 01:11:53,626
The rain.

719
01:11:55,295 --> 01:11:57,630
Sometimes it
gives me the blues.

720
01:12:01,301 --> 01:12:04,387
When you first came here,

721
01:12:04,471 --> 01:12:06,806
I only loved the writer
part of Paul Sheldon.

722
01:12:09,351 --> 01:12:12,311
But now I know I love
the rest of him, too.

723
01:12:18,944 --> 01:12:21,112
I know you don't love me.

724
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:23,989
Don't say you do.

725
01:12:25,659 --> 01:12:30,287
You're a beautiful, brilliant,
famous man of the world

726
01:12:30,372 --> 01:12:35,167
and I'm not
a movie-star type.

727
01:12:42,008 --> 01:12:45,094
You'll never know the fear
of losing someone like you,

728
01:12:45,178 --> 01:12:47,221
if you're someone like me.

729
01:12:48,306 --> 01:12:50,182
Why would you lose me?

730
01:12:54,062 --> 01:12:56,397
The book's almost finished.

731
01:12:58,525 --> 01:13:00,734
Your legs are getting better.

732
01:13:02,154 --> 01:13:04,864
Soon you'll be
wanting to leave.

733
01:13:05,115 --> 01:13:08,701
Why would I leave?
I like it here.

734
01:13:09,119 --> 01:13:14,206
That's very kind of you, but I'll
bet it's not altogether true.

735
01:13:32,309 --> 01:13:33,976
I have this gun.

736
01:13:38,273 --> 01:13:40,733
Sometimes I think
about using it.

737
01:13:47,240 --> 01:13:48,908
I better go now.

738
01:13:51,912 --> 01:13:53,996
I might put bullets in it.

739
01:14:42,295 --> 01:14:45,422
"There is a justice
higher than that of man.

740
01:14:45,507 --> 01:14:47,841
"I will be judged by Him."

741
01:14:47,926 --> 01:14:49,093
What?

742
01:14:49,177 --> 01:14:51,595
They're haulin'
Misery into court.

743
01:14:52,764 --> 01:14:54,390
That's nice.

744
01:15:02,357 --> 01:15:06,819
There is a justice
higher than that of man.

745
01:15:08,363 --> 01:15:12,866
I will be judged by Him.

746
01:19:37,006 --> 01:19:39,007
See you in the morning.

747
01:20:30,518 --> 01:20:35,105
I'm supposed to lead to
the finale of my show right now,

748
01:20:35,189 --> 01:20:38,066
but I'm having such a
wonderful time that I have...

749
01:20:38,151 --> 01:20:39,318
Paul.

750
01:20:43,781 --> 01:20:44,865
Hmm?

751
01:20:45,992 --> 01:20:47,993
I know you've been out.

752
01:20:52,999 --> 01:20:54,166
What?

753
01:20:54,250 --> 01:20:56,501
You've been out of your room.

754
01:20:57,587 --> 01:20:59,421
No, I haven't.

755
01:20:59,505 --> 01:21:02,424
Paul, my little
ceramic penguin

756
01:21:02,508 --> 01:21:04,676
in the study
always faces due south.

757
01:21:07,138 --> 01:21:10,265
I don't know what
you're talking about.

758
01:21:11,184 --> 01:21:12,684
Ceramic penguin?

759
01:21:13,937 --> 01:21:16,355
Is this what
you're looking for?

760
01:21:18,691 --> 01:21:21,109
I know you've
been out twice, Paul.

761
01:21:21,194 --> 01:21:23,737
At first I couldn't
figure out how you did it,

762
01:21:23,821 --> 01:21:26,406
but last night
I found your key.

763
01:21:30,495 --> 01:21:33,288
I know I left
my scrapbook out.

764
01:21:33,373 --> 01:21:35,874
I can imagine what you
might be thinking of me.

765
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:38,543
But you see, Paul,
it's all okay.

766
01:21:38,628 --> 01:21:41,046
Last night it came so clear.

767
01:21:41,130 --> 01:21:43,382
I realize you just
need more time.

768
01:21:43,466 --> 01:21:46,551
Eventually you'll come to
accept the idea of being here.

769
01:21:47,804 --> 01:21:49,471
Paul, do you know
about the early days

770
01:21:49,555 --> 01:21:51,848
at the Kimberley
diamond mines?

771
01:21:51,933 --> 01:21:55,602
Do you know what they did to the
native workers who stole diamonds?

772
01:21:55,687 --> 01:21:58,146
Don't worry.
They didn't kill them.

773
01:21:58,231 --> 01:21:59,982
That would be like
junking a Mercedes

774
01:22:00,066 --> 01:22:01,858
just because it had
a broken spring.

775
01:22:01,943 --> 01:22:03,986
No, if they caught them
they had to make sure

776
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:05,362
they could go on working,

777
01:22:05,446 --> 01:22:08,490
but they also had to make sure
they could never run away.

778
01:22:08,574 --> 01:22:11,159
The operation
was called "hobbling."

779
01:22:20,878 --> 01:22:25,257
Annie, whatever you're
thinking about doing,

780
01:22:25,341 --> 01:22:27,092
please don't do it.

781
01:22:31,597 --> 01:22:33,223
Annie, for God's...

782
01:22:33,307 --> 01:22:36,226
Darling. Trust me.

783
01:22:36,310 --> 01:22:37,352
God's sake!

784
01:22:37,437 --> 01:22:38,437
It's for the best.

785
01:22:38,521 --> 01:22:39,855
Annie, please!

786
01:22:42,942 --> 01:22:46,028
Almost done.
Just one more.

787
01:22:55,329 --> 01:22:57,122
God, I love you.

788
01:23:27,278 --> 01:23:28,987
You cockadoodie!

789
01:23:43,002 --> 01:23:44,086
Turn on this!

790
01:23:44,170 --> 01:23:45,253
You poop!

791
01:24:01,312 --> 01:24:03,063
Just leave it, all right?

792
01:24:03,147 --> 01:24:05,357
I like that tone!

793
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,025
How many times do I
have to tell you?

794
01:24:07,110 --> 01:24:10,278
I have a system here! Where
the hell is that thing?

795
01:24:10,363 --> 01:24:11,530
What thing?

796
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:12,697
The thing!

797
01:24:14,117 --> 01:24:16,368
Here it is, right where
it's supposed to be.

798
01:24:16,452 --> 01:24:17,536
What is it?

799
01:24:18,246 --> 01:24:20,455
I'm not sure.
Maybe nothin'.

800
01:24:20,832 --> 01:24:22,749
Well, I'm glad you found it.

801
01:24:22,834 --> 01:24:24,417
There's that spice again.

802
01:25:40,453 --> 01:25:43,455
Come on, Misie.
Come on.

803
01:25:44,457 --> 01:25:45,999
Hi, pumpkin.

804
01:25:48,961 --> 01:25:52,339
Such a kidder!
Come on, Misery.

805
01:26:02,558 --> 01:26:04,434
Hey, Pete.

806
01:26:04,518 --> 01:26:05,727
Buster.

807
01:26:05,811 --> 01:26:07,687
Answer me a couple things.

808
01:26:07,772 --> 01:26:09,564
If I can.

809
01:26:09,649 --> 01:26:12,150
Do you have any new
Paul Sheldon books?

810
01:26:12,235 --> 01:26:13,693
Well, we had a batch.

811
01:26:13,778 --> 01:26:15,862
Sold 'em all out
in three days.

812
01:26:15,947 --> 01:26:20,200
You wouldn't happen to know if Miss
Wilkes bought one of them, would you?

813
01:26:20,284 --> 01:26:23,912
Are you kiddin'? Every time
that fella writes a new book,

814
01:26:23,996 --> 01:26:26,665
she has me set aside
the first copy.

815
01:26:27,792 --> 01:26:30,877
Has she been buyin'
anything odd lately?

816
01:26:30,962 --> 01:26:34,589
Miss Wilkes?
Same old stuff.

817
01:26:35,549 --> 01:26:38,301
Lest you call paper odd.

818
01:26:38,386 --> 01:26:39,719
Newspaper?

819
01:26:39,804 --> 01:26:42,597
No. The typin' kind.

820
01:26:42,682 --> 01:26:46,101
That kind.
Nothin' odd about that.

821
01:26:46,185 --> 01:26:47,936
Miss Wilkes done somethin'?

822
01:26:48,020 --> 01:26:49,312
Not a thing.

823
01:27:50,416 --> 01:27:52,876
I don't think I'll ever understand you.
I cook your meals,

824
01:27:52,960 --> 01:27:56,046
I tend to you practically
24 hours a day,

825
01:27:56,130 --> 01:27:58,340
and you continue
to fight me.

826
01:27:58,424 --> 01:28:00,759
When are we going to
develop a sense of trust?

827
01:28:30,122 --> 01:28:31,414
Oh, my.

828
01:28:31,749 --> 01:28:33,541
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
to startle you,

829
01:28:33,626 --> 01:28:35,960
but you didn't give me
a chance to knock.

830
01:28:36,045 --> 01:28:37,629
I guess you can tell
from my reaction

831
01:28:37,713 --> 01:28:40,048
I'm not all that used
to visitors out here.

832
01:28:40,132 --> 01:28:41,508
What can I do for you?

833
01:28:41,592 --> 01:28:43,885
Well, I was wonderin', do
you happen to know anything

834
01:28:43,969 --> 01:28:46,388
about Paul Sheldon?

835
01:28:46,472 --> 01:28:48,556
What do you want to know?

836
01:28:48,641 --> 01:28:51,017
Well, anything you
could tell me might help.

837
01:28:52,311 --> 01:28:55,230
Well, he was born in Worcester,
Massachusetts, 45 years ago,

838
01:28:55,314 --> 01:28:57,148
the only child of Franklin
and Helene Sheldon,

839
01:28:57,233 --> 01:28:58,733
mediocre student,
majored in History...

840
01:28:58,818 --> 01:29:01,903
Well that... That isn't exactly the
kind of information I'm after.

841
01:29:01,987 --> 01:29:04,447
You see, he's been missin'
for quite some time now...

842
01:29:04,532 --> 01:29:06,408
I know. It's so upsetting.

843
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:07,742
I'm his number-one fan.

844
01:29:07,827 --> 01:29:10,412
I've got all his books. Every
sentence he ever put down.

845
01:29:10,496 --> 01:29:13,456
I'm so proud of my
Paul Sheldon collection.

846
01:29:15,626 --> 01:29:18,253
Well, here I am,
prattling on,

847
01:29:18,337 --> 01:29:19,587
and my manners
have just flown away.

848
01:29:19,672 --> 01:29:21,673
I haven't invited you in.
Please.

849
01:29:21,757 --> 01:29:23,174
Thank you.

850
01:29:24,427 --> 01:29:27,846
Of course, you must know all
about that horrible accident.

851
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,639
Mind if I take a look around?

852
01:29:29,723 --> 01:29:31,015
Of course not.

853
01:29:32,017 --> 01:29:34,644
That accident almost
killed me, too.

854
01:29:34,728 --> 01:29:36,521
I prayed when
I heard the news.

855
01:29:36,605 --> 01:29:40,150
I got down on my knees and I
begged for it not to be true.

856
01:29:40,234 --> 01:29:41,818
You're gonna laugh
at what I'm about to say,

857
01:29:41,902 --> 01:29:45,238
but go ahead,
I don't care.

858
01:29:45,322 --> 01:29:48,783
When I was praying,
God told me to get ready.

859
01:29:49,493 --> 01:29:50,869
Get ready
for what?

860
01:29:50,953 --> 01:29:52,996
To be his replacement.

861
01:29:53,080 --> 01:29:55,915
He gave so much pleasure
to so many people,

862
01:29:56,000 --> 01:29:58,793
and there's a shortage of pleasure
on the planet these days,

863
01:29:58,878 --> 01:30:00,920
in case you
hadn't noticed.

864
01:30:01,005 --> 01:30:03,798
God told me, since I was
his number-one fan,

865
01:30:03,883 --> 01:30:07,343
that I should make up new stories
as if I was Paul Sheldon.

866
01:30:07,428 --> 01:30:10,597
So I went to town, and
I bought a typewriter,

867
01:30:10,681 --> 01:30:11,806
and paper to type on,

868
01:30:11,891 --> 01:30:14,309
the same kind
Paul Sheldon used.

869
01:30:14,393 --> 01:30:17,270
And I turned the guest bedroom
into a writing studio.

870
01:30:17,354 --> 01:30:18,813
Would you like to see it?

871
01:30:18,898 --> 01:30:19,898
Sure.

872
01:30:19,982 --> 01:30:21,149
It's right this way.

873
01:30:30,993 --> 01:30:34,162
I know how he wrote. The
kinds of words he used,

874
01:30:34,246 --> 01:30:36,498
the wonderful stories
he told.

875
01:30:36,582 --> 01:30:37,790
I've spent the last
four weeks

876
01:30:37,917 --> 01:30:40,001
trying to write
like Paul Sheldon,

877
01:30:40,085 --> 01:30:41,878
but I can't do it right.

878
01:30:41,962 --> 01:30:46,925
I try and I try, and I know all the
words, but it's just not the same.

879
01:30:47,009 --> 01:30:50,803
Well, maybe it takes a while
to get the hang of it.

880
01:30:50,888 --> 01:30:53,056
I could give you a couple
of hundred pages of mine

881
01:30:53,140 --> 01:30:54,849
and you could tell
me what you think.

882
01:30:54,934 --> 01:30:56,684
I'm not much of a critic.

883
01:30:56,769 --> 01:30:59,354
Well, I just thought...

884
01:30:59,438 --> 01:31:02,106
Oh, look at me. You'd think
I'd never had a guest before!

885
01:31:02,191 --> 01:31:03,900
Would you like a nice
hot cup of cocoa?

886
01:31:03,984 --> 01:31:04,984
No, really, I don't...

887
01:31:05,069 --> 01:31:06,361
It's no trouble.

888
01:31:06,445 --> 01:31:08,613
There's some already made.

889
01:31:15,329 --> 01:31:18,623
Must get lonely, livin'
out here all by yourself.

890
01:31:20,501 --> 01:31:23,044
Well, I always say, if you
can't enjoy your own company,

891
01:31:23,128 --> 01:31:25,505
you're not fit company
for anyone else.

892
01:31:25,589 --> 01:31:27,966
Well, you've got
a point there.

893
01:32:34,992 --> 01:32:35,950
Here you are.

894
01:32:36,035 --> 01:32:37,994
Well, thanks, Miss Wilkes,

895
01:32:38,078 --> 01:32:40,246
but I don't want to take up
any more of your time.

896
01:32:42,041 --> 01:32:43,958
I best be goin'.

897
01:32:44,043 --> 01:32:47,003
But you didn't even
taste your cocoa.

898
01:32:47,087 --> 01:32:51,174
I'm sure it's wonderful, but I
really should be gettin' back.

899
01:32:56,889 --> 01:32:58,806
If you wouldn't mind,
perhaps I could

900
01:32:58,891 --> 01:33:00,475
pay you another
visit sometime.

901
01:33:00,559 --> 01:33:03,603
I'd be delighted,
now that you know the way.

902
01:33:21,914 --> 01:33:23,247
Miss Wilkes?

903
01:33:24,667 --> 01:33:26,959
Miss Wilkes,
are you all right?

904
01:33:28,003 --> 01:33:29,545
Here!

905
01:33:29,963 --> 01:33:32,215
Here! I'm down here!

906
01:33:32,591 --> 01:33:34,425
I'm down here!

907
01:33:37,429 --> 01:33:38,846
Mr. Sheldon?

908
01:33:49,608 --> 01:33:51,609
Don't feel bad, Paul.

909
01:33:52,194 --> 01:33:55,697
It was bound to happen
sooner or later.

910
01:33:55,781 --> 01:33:56,906
It's a sign.

911
01:33:59,284 --> 01:34:03,871
You see, I've known for some time
why I was chosen to save you.

912
01:34:03,956 --> 01:34:07,208
You and I were meant
to be together forever.

913
01:34:07,292 --> 01:34:09,711
But now our time
in this world must end.

914
01:34:10,921 --> 01:34:13,089
But don't worry, Paul.

915
01:34:13,173 --> 01:34:15,091
I've prepared
for what must be done.

916
01:34:16,635 --> 01:34:21,889
I put two bullets in my gun,
one for you and one for me.

917
01:34:23,183 --> 01:34:25,601
Darling,
it'll be so beautiful.

918
01:34:45,330 --> 01:34:47,498
Now don't be afraid.

919
01:34:48,751 --> 01:34:50,168
I love you.

920
01:34:53,672 --> 01:34:55,506
I love you, too.

921
01:34:58,260 --> 01:35:02,346
And you're right.
We are meant to be together.

922
01:35:03,390 --> 01:35:05,850
And I know we must die.

923
01:35:07,144 --> 01:35:11,355
But it must be
so that Misery can live.

924
01:35:13,692 --> 01:35:18,237
We have the power
to give Misery eternal life.

925
01:35:19,990 --> 01:35:22,074
We must finish the book.

926
01:35:25,496 --> 01:35:28,998
But the time is now.
Soon others will come.

927
01:35:30,959 --> 01:35:32,794
It's almost finished.

928
01:35:34,546 --> 01:35:35,880
By dawn

929
01:35:37,341 --> 01:35:41,886
we'll be able to give Misery
back to the world.

930
01:36:04,910 --> 01:36:07,161
I'll fix you
something to eat.

931
01:36:23,804 --> 01:36:25,805
Paul, I'm dying!

932
01:36:25,889 --> 01:36:28,933
Does she wind up
with Ian or Windthorne?

933
01:36:29,017 --> 01:36:31,060
You'll know very soon.

934
01:36:31,144 --> 01:36:33,104
I've just started
the last chapter.

935
01:36:33,939 --> 01:36:39,443
You know, when I finish, I'd
like everything to be perfect.

936
01:36:40,445 --> 01:36:42,530
I'll need three things.

937
01:36:42,614 --> 01:36:44,115
What things?

938
01:36:45,367 --> 01:36:47,368
You mean you don't know?

939
01:36:48,787 --> 01:36:51,163
I was foolin', silly.

940
01:36:51,248 --> 01:36:54,417
You need a cigarette, because
you used to smoke but you quit,

941
01:36:54,501 --> 01:36:58,045
except when you finish a
book, and you have just one.

942
01:36:58,130 --> 01:37:00,172
And the match
is to light it,

943
01:37:00,257 --> 01:37:04,385
and you need one glass of
champagne, Dom Perignon.

944
01:37:05,679 --> 01:37:07,471
Dom Perignon it is.

945
01:37:27,701 --> 01:37:31,329
Annie, Annie?

946
01:37:32,623 --> 01:37:33,998
Yes, Paul?

947
01:37:35,876 --> 01:37:37,960
I'm almost done.

948
01:37:38,045 --> 01:37:40,755
Oh, Paul,
this is so romantic!

949
01:37:40,839 --> 01:37:44,175
Ian and Windthorne dueling for
the right to Misery's hand.

950
01:37:44,259 --> 01:37:46,969
Does Ian win?
Don't tell me.

951
01:37:47,054 --> 01:37:48,346
It's Windthorne, right?

952
01:37:48,889 --> 01:37:51,724
You'll know everything
in a minute.

953
01:37:51,808 --> 01:37:53,059
Get the champagne.

954
01:38:29,721 --> 01:38:31,389
Did I do good?

955
01:38:33,100 --> 01:38:34,725
You did perfect.

956
01:38:36,728 --> 01:38:38,562
Except for one thing.

957
01:38:40,107 --> 01:38:42,942
This time we'll need
two glasses.

958
01:38:44,403 --> 01:38:46,278
Oh, Paul.

959
01:39:21,314 --> 01:39:22,648
Remember how,
for all those years,

960
01:39:22,733 --> 01:39:25,609
nobody knew who
Misery's real father was?

961
01:39:25,694 --> 01:39:28,237
Or if they'd
ever be reunited?

962
01:39:28,321 --> 01:39:29,822
It's all right here.

963
01:39:29,906 --> 01:39:33,784
Does she finally marry Ian,
or will it be Windthorne?

964
01:39:33,869 --> 01:39:35,661
It's all right here.

965
01:39:37,956 --> 01:39:40,082
Paul, you can't!

966
01:39:40,167 --> 01:39:42,626
Why not?
I learned it from you.

967
01:39:44,713 --> 01:39:48,799
No, no, no! Not Misery!
Not my Misery!

968
01:39:49,301 --> 01:39:51,802
No! Not my Misery!

969
01:40:03,982 --> 01:40:06,734
I'm gonna kill you,
you lying cocksucker!

970
01:40:45,857 --> 01:40:48,859
Here, you want it?
You want it? Eat it!

971
01:40:49,027 --> 01:40:53,697
Eat it till you choke,
you sick, twisted fuck!

972
01:42:46,770 --> 01:42:49,480
This is it.
The very first copy.

973
01:42:50,357 --> 01:42:53,359
The word I'm getting is the Times
review is gonna be a love letter.

974
01:42:53,443 --> 01:42:54,902
That'll be a first.

975
01:42:54,986 --> 01:42:58,239
And my contacts at Time and Newsweek
tell me they're both raves.

976
01:42:58,323 --> 01:43:00,115
And don't laugh,
but for the first time

977
01:43:00,200 --> 01:43:02,326
I think you've got
a shot at some prizes.

978
01:43:02,410 --> 01:43:03,994
Great.

979
01:43:04,079 --> 01:43:06,205
I thought you'd be thrilled.

980
01:43:06,289 --> 01:43:07,998
You're being taken seriously.

981
01:43:08,083 --> 01:43:10,042
I'm delighted
the critics are liking it

982
01:43:10,126 --> 01:43:12,294
and I hope the people
like it, too.

983
01:43:12,754 --> 01:43:15,089
But I wrote it for me.

984
01:43:16,007 --> 01:43:19,468
Now, don't think
I'm completely nuts, but...

985
01:43:20,345 --> 01:43:24,181
In some way, Annie Wilkes,

986
01:43:25,016 --> 01:43:27,017
that whole experience,

987
01:43:28,353 --> 01:43:30,604
helped me.

988
01:43:30,689 --> 01:43:32,731
Paul, since you
brought her up,

989
01:43:32,816 --> 01:43:36,318
I have to ask you this or I'll be
drummed out of the agents' union.

990
01:43:36,403 --> 01:43:38,320
How would you feel
about a non-fiction book

991
01:43:38,405 --> 01:43:40,281
about what went on
in that house?

992
01:43:40,365 --> 01:43:42,783
Gee, Marcia, if I didn't know you
better, I'd think you were suggesting

993
01:43:42,867 --> 01:43:44,326
I dredge up the worst
horror of my life

994
01:43:44,411 --> 01:43:47,204
just so we can make
a few bucks.

995
01:43:48,164 --> 01:43:49,790
I thought you
were over it.

996
01:43:49,874 --> 01:43:53,585
I don't know if anyone could ever
totally get over something like that.

997
01:43:53,670 --> 01:43:55,087
It's weird.

998
01:43:56,631 --> 01:43:58,924
Even though I know
she's dead,

999
01:44:00,385 --> 01:44:03,429
I still think about
her once in a while.

1000
01:44:03,513 --> 01:44:07,433
Excuse me. I don't mean to bother
you, but are you Paul Sheldon?

1001
01:44:07,517 --> 01:44:09,018
Yes.

1002
01:44:09,102 --> 01:44:11,729
I just want to tell you
I'm your number-one fan.

1003
01:44:12,731 --> 01:44:14,773
That's very sweet of you.
