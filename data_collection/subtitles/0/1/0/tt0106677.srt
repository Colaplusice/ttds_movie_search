About aliens?

1251
01:16:57,212 --> 01:17:00,306
Yeah, man.
You didn't know that?
This country is founded...

1252
01:17:00,382 --> 01:17:03,374
It was founded by people
who were into aliens, man.

1253
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:07,752
George Washington, man,
he was in a cult, and the cult
was into aliens, man.

<i>No.</i>

into that type of stuff.

Behind every good man,
there's a woman, and that woman
was Martha Washington, man,

1280
01:18:35,977 --> 01:18:37,911
and every day,
George would come home,

waiting for him, man,

Hmm. Okay, Mitchell.

So I hoped
you enjoyed it.
No.

1556
01:35:19,613 --> 01:35:24,915
Your sister told me
everything, so I've decided
to make this deal with you.

1557
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:27,920
I'm... Well, I'm
gonna be open-minded
about it this time,

1558
01:35:27,988 --> 01:35:31,515

come in at sunrise,

1559
01:35:31,592 --> 01:35:33,753
we've got problems.

1560
01:35:42,002 --> 01:35:45,870

who gave you a ride?

1561
01:35:45,940 --> 01:35:48,033
Oh, she's just like...

1562
01:35:48,109 --> 01:35:50,441
Have you been drinking?

1563
01:35:50,511 --> 01:35:52,479
No.

1564
01:35:52,546 --> 01:35:55,674
- Are you drunk?
