1
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:16,499
Due to the threat of Fascism
and world War l,

2
00:00:17,102 --> 00:00:17,898
A crowd ofjobless pilot

3
00:00:18,403 --> 00:00:18,994
Is driving their planes in the sky,

4
00:00:20,505 --> 00:00:21,995
Doing the thief business.

5
00:00:22,507 --> 00:00:23,405
The air security unit
takes encircle and suppress action.

6
00:00:23,909 --> 00:00:24,500
Air pirates are most afraid of
this movie's leading actor,

7
00:00:26,311 --> 00:00:27,300
Porco Rosso.

8
00:00:28,113 --> 00:00:28,807
Porco was once the hero in the air unit,
but for unknown reason

9
00:00:29,214 --> 00:00:30,112
He refused to return to the unit,
and make curse,

10
00:00:31,616 --> 00:00:33,516
He then became a fat piggy.

11
00:00:33,919 --> 00:00:34,510
Only his old air unit partner Gina knows

12
00:00:37,122 --> 00:00:37,816
How he used to be. How did Porco fight with

13
00:00:38,223 --> 00:00:38,621
air pirates ...

14
00:00:42,928 --> 00:00:49,527
Porcoros

15
00:01:42,487 --> 00:01:43,078
Yeah?!

16
00:01:43,588 --> 00:01:45,180
Porco Rosso, get going.

17
00:01:45,590 --> 00:01:46,682
'Mamma Aiuto' is on the move.

18
00:01:46,992 --> 00:01:48,186
'Mamma Aiuto'?

19
00:01:48,894 --> 00:01:50,589
I don't need a cheap job.

20
00:01:51,396 --> 00:01:53,193
A charter ship from Venice was attacked.

21
00:01:53,598 --> 00:01:54,997
They are stealing fuel from the ship.

22
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:56,094
Is that it?

23
00:01:56,902 --> 00:01:58,494
Ah... Well...

24
00:01:58,904 --> 00:02:01,395
Girl students on vacation were on board.

25
00:02:02,207 --> 00:02:04,107
It's going to be more costly then you think.

26
00:02:04,509 --> 00:02:05,999
I'm going to apply part three
of the contract 14 to this case.

27
00:02:06,311 --> 00:02:07,403
And part four, too.

28
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:12,213
Stop,

29
00:02:12,717 --> 00:02:16,312
or I'm going to sink you! Stop!

30
00:02:16,621 --> 00:02:17,519
I'm going to be kidnapped, yeah!

31
00:02:17,923 --> 00:02:18,617
They're pirates, sea pirates!

32
00:02:18,924 --> 00:02:19,913
It's 'sea pirates'. It's 'air pirates'.

33
00:02:46,852 --> 00:02:50,253
It needs 'overhaul', huh...

34
00:03:21,486 --> 00:03:22,783
Are you bad guys?

35
00:03:23,088 --> 00:03:23,782
Yeah.

36
00:03:24,189 --> 00:03:25,383
Are we hostages?

37
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:26,582
Yeah.

38
00:03:26,992 --> 00:03:27,981
You guys are called air pirates,
aren't you?

39
00:03:28,393 --> 00:03:29,382
You know a lot.

40
00:03:29,794 --> 00:03:31,284
It's a skull.

41
00:03:31,596 --> 00:03:32,290
Neat, isn't it?

42
00:03:32,898 --> 00:03:34,889
Hurry up kids! I'm busy.

43
00:03:36,101 --> 00:03:38,695
Do you want all 15 of them?

44
00:03:39,104 --> 00:03:42,096
It's not nice for a girl
to be left behind, don't you think.

45
00:04:00,625 --> 00:04:01,819
I'm late

46
00:04:02,227 --> 00:04:04,320
The girls were kidnapped!
Bring the girls back!

47
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,827
They went that way!

48
00:04:07,532 --> 00:04:10,433
No...! not that way!

49
00:04:21,746 --> 00:04:23,145
I know what they are thinking.

50
00:04:23,548 --> 00:04:24,742
Because they're poor and stingy

51
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:27,448
and want to save on gasoline

52
00:04:28,153 --> 00:04:29,950
they will change their course to nearest island

53
00:04:30,355 --> 00:04:32,346
as soon as they're out of sight.

54
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,952
Shit!

55
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,166
Damn it!

56
00:05:00,185 --> 00:05:01,880
This is no good.

57
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:08,186
Here we are.

58
00:05:22,607 --> 00:05:23,505
What the heck is this?

59
00:05:23,908 --> 00:05:26,103
A sightseeing plane around the islands.

60
00:05:27,012 --> 00:05:27,808
A pig!

61
00:05:28,213 --> 00:05:29,009
It's a pig!

62
00:05:29,414 --> 00:05:31,814
It's a pig. What a cute pig...

63
00:05:32,017 --> 00:05:35,714
You girls could be kidnapped here.
Watch out babes!

64
00:05:39,924 --> 00:05:41,118
Cool! He's cool!!

65
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:55,833
What a nuisance!

66
00:05:57,742 --> 00:05:59,642
We are flying! Let me see, let me see!

67
00:06:00,145 --> 00:06:01,442
Hey, kids. Don't.

68
00:06:01,846 --> 00:06:03,939
Shut up, shut up, please.

69
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:05,848
Hey, do something, will you?

70
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:09,047
That's why I asked
if we wanted to take all of them.

71
00:06:11,356 --> 00:06:12,653
Ok, just for a little bit.

72
00:06:13,258 --> 00:06:15,249
Coz you are too naughty...

73
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,549
Wow! Wonderful!

74
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:18,060
Hey, look at that!

75
00:06:18,563 --> 00:06:19,461
It's a red plane.

76
00:06:20,165 --> 00:06:21,063
Where, where!

77
00:06:21,966 --> 00:06:22,762
He is over there, isn't he?

78
00:06:23,168 --> 00:06:24,066
Yes!

79
00:06:28,973 --> 00:06:30,463
I'm not going to let you go any further.

80
00:06:32,677 --> 00:06:34,076
See, he is coming.

81
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,479
That's Porco Rosso!

82
00:06:36,881 --> 00:06:37,870
Hey, I can't see. I can't see.

83
00:06:42,387 --> 00:06:43,979
Holly cow!

84
00:06:44,289 --> 00:06:44,983
It stopped.

85
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:46,086
We are gonna fall.

86
00:06:46,491 --> 00:06:47,082
Not yet!

87
00:06:47,492 --> 00:06:48,891
We have one more engine!

88
00:06:52,197 --> 00:06:53,789
Damn it. What the heck are you doing!

89
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,188
Shoot, shoot him, shoot him down!

90
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,996
Wow! That red plane is cool isn't it?

91
00:07:02,807 --> 00:07:03,603
You can't hit him, can you?

92
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:04,804
You're in my way.

93
00:07:11,916 --> 00:07:12,814
The morse code!

94
00:07:13,318 --> 00:07:15,309
You loose. Listen to me.

95
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:16,314
Shut up!

96
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:22,219
There, he is coming! Here!

97
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:23,221
Get your heads down!

98
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,027
Where,

99
00:07:27,332 --> 00:07:28,924
where is he?

100
00:07:40,245 --> 00:07:41,041
He must be hiding.

101
00:07:41,446 --> 00:07:42,140
Wow. We are sinking.

102
00:07:42,447 --> 00:07:43,641
Let's go, let's go! Come!

103
00:07:44,349 --> 00:07:46,340
We are not sinking.
This is a plane!

104
00:07:52,857 --> 00:07:54,950
Sank!

105
00:07:55,660 --> 00:07:57,560
Don't! It's dangerous!

106
00:07:57,962 --> 00:07:59,554
Stop them.
They are very valuable hostages to us!

107
00:08:00,165 --> 00:08:00,961
Don't worry, mister.

108
00:08:01,466 --> 00:08:03,457
We are students at the swimming school.

109
00:08:03,868 --> 00:08:06,462
Oh, no. Me, too.

110
00:08:06,871 --> 00:08:08,270
Contact from the pig again.

111
00:08:09,474 --> 00:08:11,374
I'm going to allow you
to take half of the gold coins.

112
00:08:11,776 --> 00:08:14,074
But leave the rest of the coins
and the hostages, behind!

113
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:17,377
If you don't,
I'm going to kill you all!

114
00:08:17,982 --> 00:08:18,880
says the pig. But...

115
00:08:19,284 --> 00:08:19,978
A half of the coins!?

116
00:08:20,285 --> 00:08:20,979
Keep your mouth shut!

117
00:08:21,686 --> 00:08:23,586
Come on, Pig.

118
00:08:23,888 --> 00:08:24,479
Let's have the fight!

119
00:08:29,994 --> 00:08:31,484
You go to hell!

120
00:08:31,896 --> 00:08:33,693
Here we go! What?!

121
00:08:34,098 --> 00:08:34,689
It's broken.

122
00:08:36,201 --> 00:08:39,398
It's over, it's over.

123
00:08:43,408 --> 00:08:47,105
Bye bye, play with us again, will you?

124
00:08:47,512 --> 00:08:48,809
Bye bye.

125
00:08:49,214 --> 00:08:51,011
Everything is fine, isn't it?
Since we have enough money for repairs

126
00:08:51,416 --> 00:08:53,407
You, idiot. Be greedy!

127
00:09:00,325 --> 00:09:03,123
Calm down, calm down, will you.

128
00:09:05,330 --> 00:09:07,423
Don't touch that,
it will get broken.

129
00:09:10,935 --> 00:09:12,835
Don't go close to the propeller.

130
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:15,633
Uhm? Pee? Do it around there, will you?

131
00:09:20,144 --> 00:09:22,544
Mamma Aiuto's guys
said they couldn't come to see us.

132
00:09:23,448 --> 00:09:27,145
Shit! Such a pig became a hero...

133
00:09:27,652 --> 00:09:30,143
but, the young fella is an American,
isn't he?

134
00:09:30,555 --> 00:09:32,648
If he is,

135
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:35,150
that's a shame for the pilots
of the Adriatic.

136
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,458
Oh, not at all.

137
00:09:36,861 --> 00:09:38,658
His grandmother is quarter ltalian.

138
00:09:39,063 --> 00:09:40,655
Anyway, we should do something
about the Porco.

139
00:09:41,065 --> 00:09:42,464
We have a great deal of trouble.

140
00:09:43,067 --> 00:09:45,058
But, 10%/! That's not fair.

141
00:11:29,374 --> 00:11:30,272
Here he comes.

142
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:33,075
He sucks. He is a fake.

143
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:34,977
Shhh...

144
00:11:48,693 --> 00:11:49,489
Mr. Porco Rosso!

145
00:11:49,894 --> 00:11:51,384
I'm a reporter for
the Neptune newspaper,

146
00:11:51,896 --> 00:11:53,193
you did anther great job,
again.

147
00:11:53,698 --> 00:11:56,098
I think 'Mamma Aiuto'
is not going to appear again for a while.

148
00:11:56,801 --> 00:12:01,295
About your estimated bounty this year, people
said the amount must be over that of the last year...

149
00:12:02,206 --> 00:12:04,697
Ouch! ... Wait. Let go of me.

150
00:12:06,911 --> 00:12:09,402
Listen to a song in silence.

151
00:12:18,322 --> 00:12:19,914
She is a wonderful lady.

152
00:12:20,925 --> 00:12:22,324
Madam Gina of the hotel Adriano

153
00:12:22,727 --> 00:12:24,718
is very famous among the pilots
through out this country.

154
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,531
During her song, even air pirates
and bounty hunters become good guys.

155
00:12:29,634 --> 00:12:31,226
Is that plane up front yours?

156
00:12:32,537 --> 00:12:35,938
Yeah, it's a plane of the rattle snake,

157
00:12:36,441 --> 00:12:38,432
bringing me fame and fortune.

158
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:40,233
The plane beat an ltalian
at the Schneider cup, twice.

159
00:12:40,745 --> 00:12:43,043
Not only is it fast,
but it is also and excellent fighter.

160
00:12:44,248 --> 00:12:48,241
I heard that a small pig named Porco Rosso
is famous around here.

161
00:12:49,053 --> 00:12:51,851
If you make a deal with the air pirates,
watch your tail 'cowboy'.

162
00:12:52,557 --> 00:12:53,956
They are misers and are poor, too.

163
00:12:54,659 --> 00:12:56,456
They stink,
for they don't take a shower.

164
00:12:58,262 --> 00:12:59,160
Uh... I know that.

165
00:12:59,564 --> 00:12:59,859
What!

166
00:13:00,164 --> 00:13:01,062
Come on, you little chicken shit!

167
00:13:01,766 --> 00:13:02,664
What!

168
00:13:03,067 --> 00:13:05,661
What's going on tonight?
You're up to no good, aren't you?

169
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:07,665
He, he, he, he, yes mam.

170
00:13:08,973 --> 00:13:10,770
I'm glad you came,

171
00:13:11,175 --> 00:13:12,267
but don't play war games.

172
00:13:12,777 --> 00:13:14,176
We know, Gina.

173
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:17,480
We don't work within 50km
from this establishment.

174
00:13:17,882 --> 00:13:19,873
We are getting along with even that pig.

175
00:13:22,687 --> 00:13:23,984
You're good boys.

176
00:13:24,489 --> 00:13:25,786
See you later.

177
00:13:33,798 --> 00:13:35,595
Whaa, whaa, what are you doing!

178
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,492
Hi, Porco, tell me your story.

179
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:40,002
Next time two of us are alone.

180
00:13:49,313 --> 00:13:50,803
That Mr. America is funny.

181
00:13:52,617 --> 00:13:54,915
As soon as he sees me...
Will you marry me?

182
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,913
So I told him: I married three pilots,

183
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,915
first died in the war,
the second died in Atlantic Ocean,

184
00:14:03,227 --> 00:14:05,320
and the last one died in Asia..

185
00:14:09,834 --> 00:14:11,131
You got the news?

186
00:14:12,336 --> 00:14:13,735
I got it today.

187
00:14:14,438 --> 00:14:17,339
It's says the remains were found
in the forest of Bengal.

188
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:25,743
I have been waiting for three years.

189
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:27,942
My tears dried up long ago.

190
00:14:29,654 --> 00:14:31,554
Good guys always die.

191
00:14:32,657 --> 00:14:34,147
For my friend.

192
00:14:35,059 --> 00:14:37,755
Marco, thank you for staying with me

193
00:14:45,169 --> 00:14:48,969
all these years. You are the best friend.

194
00:14:50,174 --> 00:14:52,369
The only thing I don't like

195
00:14:52,977 --> 00:14:54,376
is that you don't want
to take that picture off.

196
00:14:55,379 --> 00:14:56,573
Don't break it, you promised me.

197
00:14:57,081 --> 00:14:58,776
That's only left picture

198
00:14:59,183 --> 00:15:01,378
of Marco as a human

199
00:15:04,388 --> 00:15:08,085
How can we break your curse?

200
00:15:28,713 --> 00:15:31,409
That American is very talented...

201
00:16:00,645 --> 00:16:01,634
I envy you.

202
00:16:02,146 --> 00:16:04,137
I wish I would make money like you.

203
00:16:05,549 --> 00:16:06,846
This is the payment for this month.

204
00:16:07,351 --> 00:16:09,046
You've payed off the entire loan
for the airplane.

205
00:16:09,654 --> 00:16:14,648
Let's see, how about buying some patriots bond
in devotion to our country?

206
00:16:15,059 --> 00:16:17,550
I'll let the humans do that.

207
00:16:34,478 --> 00:16:35,570
Welcome, Mr. Porco Rosso.

208
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,969
This is ready.

209
00:16:37,381 --> 00:16:38,575
Give me 60 rounds of ammo as well.

210
00:16:38,983 --> 00:16:39,381
O.K.

211
00:16:41,786 --> 00:16:43,276
This country is busy, isn't it?

212
00:16:43,788 --> 00:16:44,584
Oh, yeah.

213
00:16:45,189 --> 00:16:46,588
The government is probably going to change?

214
00:16:47,291 --> 00:16:48,087
If so,

215
00:16:48,492 --> 00:16:50,289
people like you will be outlaws.

216
00:16:51,796 --> 00:16:53,491
Country and law
don't mean anything to a pig.

217
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,100
You're right, Mr. So goes for a mole.

218
00:17:00,604 --> 00:17:01,696
Is it ok like usual?

219
00:17:02,306 --> 00:17:04,604
We have a new supply of an incendiary bomb.

220
00:17:05,009 --> 00:17:07,910
Hey, kid. I'm not going to war.

221
00:17:08,212 --> 00:17:09,201
See you.

222
00:17:09,914 --> 00:17:11,108
Welcome...

223
00:17:13,417 --> 00:17:14,315
Excuse me, boss.

224
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,912
Could you tell me the difference
between a soldier and a bounty hunter?

225
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:20,115
Uhm... You're a scum
if you can't win in war.

226
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:23,118
You're useless and stupid
if you can't make a fortune.

227
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,626
I've never heard of an air pirate
who was deeply in debt.

228
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:29,831
We had nothing to barter with, Captain.

229
00:17:30,334 --> 00:17:32,234
We couldn't even pay for paint.

230
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:34,729
There's ships up ahead!

231
00:17:41,846 --> 00:17:45,646
Why do I have to stay
with such pathetic looking group?

232
00:17:46,150 --> 00:17:47,742
It's due to the pig, the crimson pig.

233
00:17:48,452 --> 00:17:49,441
What?

234
00:17:49,854 --> 00:17:51,845
Guys of 'Aiuto',
they don't even have money for paint.

235
00:17:52,556 --> 00:17:53,545
Poor looking boys.

236
00:17:54,959 --> 00:17:57,951
Well, we are finally complete.

237
00:17:58,362 --> 00:18:00,262
Hey, is Mr. America around?

238
00:18:01,065 --> 00:18:02,362
Yes, he is in the sun.

239
00:18:02,867 --> 00:18:04,664
Juts like we told.

240
00:18:13,277 --> 00:18:14,369
I sighted the target!

241
00:18:14,879 --> 00:18:16,369
It's the Queen of Mediterranean!

242
00:18:17,381 --> 00:18:20,179
Are we going to take on such a big ship?

243
00:18:20,584 --> 00:18:22,779
That's why we prepared well.
Don't be afraid!

244
00:18:23,487 --> 00:18:26,786
My engine is in trouble.
I'm going to back you up. You go first.

245
00:18:27,291 --> 00:18:29,987
You are cunning!
Do as we agreed!

246
00:18:30,895 --> 00:18:33,193
We share cost of repairs
and expenses when we loose, don't we?

247
00:18:34,198 --> 00:18:37,190
You, stingy...
Of course we share them!

248
00:18:38,402 --> 00:18:39,892
we need to share the bullets too?

249
00:18:40,404 --> 00:18:41,894
Altak is the only right candidate
to speak out here!

250
00:18:42,306 --> 00:18:44,206
We've just discussed this issue.

251
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:45,697
You cunning bitch!

252
00:18:46,010 --> 00:18:46,806
If we can't share that, I will quit...

253
00:18:47,111 --> 00:18:49,909
Shut up! Calm down!

254
00:18:54,118 --> 00:18:57,212
Attention please, attention please.

255
00:18:57,621 --> 00:18:59,418
Air pirates are attacking this ship,

256
00:18:59,924 --> 00:19:01,221
but there is nothing to worry about.

257
00:19:02,126 --> 00:19:05,027
This ship has excellent fighters.

258
00:19:05,830 --> 00:19:08,924
Let me introduce them.

259
00:19:11,635 --> 00:19:15,435
No. 1 is the black stallion,
signore Bulkar,

260
00:19:16,841 --> 00:19:20,834
and No.2 is the seawolf, Visconti.

261
00:19:32,156 --> 00:19:33,453
I didn't know they had fighter protection.

262
00:19:33,858 --> 00:19:34,950
How can it be?

263
00:19:43,767 --> 00:19:45,166
It's totally a mess.

264
00:19:45,769 --> 00:19:46,667
Come in this way.

265
00:19:47,171 --> 00:19:48,365
It's Curtis

266
00:19:49,373 --> 00:19:50,772
Pass it to me!

267
00:20:08,192 --> 00:20:09,784
This engine finally had it. Well,

268
00:20:12,496 --> 00:20:14,987
Iooks like I'll have to take it to Milan.

269
00:20:21,005 --> 00:20:22,802
... they were shot down,

270
00:20:23,207 --> 00:20:24,401
but they succeeded in escaping
by parachute.

271
00:20:25,509 --> 00:20:28,808
The air pirates, who took all the money
and gold away from the ship,

272
00:20:29,013 --> 00:20:30,503
Ieft the following message,

273
00:20:31,315 --> 00:20:32,509
'You are next, pig!

274
00:20:33,717 --> 00:20:35,514
Come get it, pig!'.

275
00:20:36,720 --> 00:20:38,620
I repeat,

276
00:20:38,923 --> 00:20:39,218
'You are next,pig.

277
00:20:39,723 --> 00:20:40,417
Come get it, pig.'

278
00:20:40,925 --> 00:20:42,222
This crime...

279
00:20:42,826 --> 00:20:44,817
You guys are special kind of trash.

280
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:52,231
I'm sorry, but I'm going on vacation.

281
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:56,734
White sheets,

282
00:20:57,441 --> 00:20:59,739
beautiful ladies...

283
00:21:06,350 --> 00:21:08,944
Don't give out on me yet, Mr. Engine.

284
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:35,272
I don't like this weather.

285
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:37,470
Well, guess I'll have
to go under the clouds.

286
00:22:33,637 --> 00:22:34,626
Oh, good boy, hang in there.

287
00:22:39,943 --> 00:22:42,741
Yes, you are a good boy, engine.

288
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:55,757
Rosso!

289
00:23:04,268 --> 00:23:06,065
Fight me man to man.

290
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,367
I don't have time to play with you.

291
00:23:17,181 --> 00:23:18,079
Don't run away,

292
00:23:18,482 --> 00:23:19,676
or I'm going to tell everybody about it.

293
00:23:20,284 --> 00:23:22,275
See you later, Mr. America, ha ha ha...

294
00:23:25,489 --> 00:23:27,582
Shit, I'm out of the clouds.

295
00:23:30,294 --> 00:23:30,988
Jesus.

296
00:23:32,196 --> 00:23:33,185
Gotcha!

297
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,597
No, you didn't.

298
00:23:35,899 --> 00:23:36,297
It's broken.

299
00:23:47,411 --> 00:23:48,400
I did it!

300
00:23:48,812 --> 00:23:50,211
Now, I'm a celebrity.

301
00:24:08,932 --> 00:24:10,331
They are not going to believe me

302
00:24:10,734 --> 00:24:11,826
if I don't bring back any proof.

303
00:24:12,336 --> 00:24:14,236
Let's see...

304
00:24:20,744 --> 00:24:22,143
Yes!

305
00:24:39,263 --> 00:24:41,663
This cheap, crimson colored piece.
This is it.

306
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,158
This will be a nice gift
for my mom in Alabama.

307
00:25:30,714 --> 00:25:31,806
Please hurry up.

308
00:25:37,421 --> 00:25:38,718
Madam,

309
00:25:40,023 --> 00:25:42,719
madam. Telephone, please.

310
00:25:43,026 --> 00:25:43,822
He is alive after all.

311
00:25:46,330 --> 00:25:47,524
Please get the phone at the front desk.

312
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,429
Marco, is this you?

313
00:25:58,041 --> 00:26:00,339
Did you get hurt?
I was about to leave to pick you up.

314
00:26:01,845 --> 00:26:04,040
Ok, that's fine.

315
00:26:04,548 --> 00:26:07,847
I lost some weight, because I was stranded
on a desert island. I'm going to

316
00:26:08,852 --> 00:26:11,548
Milan to repair my plane.

317
00:26:11,955 --> 00:26:13,946
If that Mr. America stops by your hotel,

318
00:26:15,659 --> 00:26:17,559
tell him this, please,
See you again next time.

319
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:21,356
What? You think of me as a
bulletin board or something?!

320
00:26:22,065 --> 00:26:24,659
However I'm worried about you guys,
pilots like you regard women

321
00:26:25,068 --> 00:26:27,866
as nails in a landing pier
or something insignificant.

322
00:26:29,773 --> 00:26:33,072
Marco,
you're going to end up as roast pork someday.

323
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:35,670
I'd hate to witness such a miserable funeral.

324
00:26:37,481 --> 00:26:39,574
A pig who doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig.

325
00:26:39,883 --> 00:26:40,474
Marco, you fool!

326
00:27:35,138 --> 00:27:36,332
Bright red broken wing.

327
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,139
I guess you would come tonight.

328
00:27:38,442 --> 00:27:39,431
I come to disturb you again!

329
00:27:40,043 --> 00:27:44,639
You lost too much this time.
Why don't you just build another one?

330
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:46,643
I want to keep this one.

331
00:27:47,451 --> 00:27:48,850
I know how you feel.

332
00:27:50,454 --> 00:27:52,445
Step aside, please.
I need drive into the factory.

333
00:27:56,460 --> 00:27:58,360
Who is that cute girl?

334
00:27:58,962 --> 00:28:00,657
My granddaughter,
who was living in America.

335
00:28:03,867 --> 00:28:07,667
Alright, alright, alright.

336
00:28:25,589 --> 00:28:26,681
Nice plane.

337
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,088
It's neat grandpa.

338
00:28:29,092 --> 00:28:30,286
Good design.

339
00:28:30,894 --> 00:28:33,590
There is almost no workers to do the job
like this these days.

340
00:28:34,297 --> 00:28:35,195
She doesn't resemble you.

341
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,290
Is she really your granddaughter?

342
00:28:39,202 --> 00:28:40,191
Don't touch her!

343
00:28:44,408 --> 00:28:45,602
Fio, I leave this to you.

344
00:28:46,610 --> 00:28:47,702
Ok. I'll do it.

345
00:28:48,812 --> 00:28:49,904
The opponent is Curtis.

346
00:28:50,414 --> 00:28:51,813
I need 15 knots more.

347
00:28:52,315 --> 00:28:54,909
Curtis? I've hear of him.

348
00:29:00,524 --> 00:29:01,320
See this.

349
00:29:01,725 --> 00:29:02,919
This is a Hallvolley, isn't it.

350
00:29:03,627 --> 00:29:05,117
Don't ask how I got this.

351
00:29:05,629 --> 00:29:09,622
An ltalian plane
which had this engine lost a race

352
00:29:09,933 --> 00:29:11,025
with Curtis at Schneider's cup in 1927.

353
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:12,932
But it lost due to poor engineering,

354
00:29:13,336 --> 00:29:15,031
not this engine.

355
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:18,034
This is exciting.

356
00:29:18,742 --> 00:29:20,539
Don't tune it up too delicately.

357
00:29:21,144 --> 00:29:22,236
My plane is not for such racing.

358
00:29:23,246 --> 00:29:27,148
An Asian proverb calls this Preaching
a sermon to buddha.. Did you know that?

359
00:29:31,655 --> 00:29:33,247
Are you going to take all of my money?

360
00:29:34,357 --> 00:29:38,760
These days,
rolls of bills aren't worth a damn.

361
00:29:39,162 --> 00:29:40,652
Give me money in your pocket,

362
00:29:41,064 --> 00:29:42,964
for propeller and paint and ...

363
00:29:43,066 --> 00:29:46,058
This is for living expenses,
such as hotel and meals.

364
00:29:46,670 --> 00:29:50,071
You can stay here.
I'm not going to charge you much. Meals included.

365
00:29:52,476 --> 00:29:55,274
I don't see your sons.
Are they alright?

366
00:29:55,579 --> 00:29:56,978
All three left looking for works.

367
00:29:57,681 --> 00:29:59,080
Then... who is going to design my plane?

368
00:29:59,783 --> 00:30:00,772
Fio is.

369
00:30:01,284 --> 00:30:03,878
Fio! That's a girl I saw, isn't she.

370
00:30:04,287 --> 00:30:08,690
She is young,
but she's got something my sons lack.

371
00:30:12,796 --> 00:30:14,991
Hey, old man.
We've known each other for long time,

372
00:30:15,699 --> 00:30:17,997
but I'll look
for another repairman this time.

373
00:30:19,903 --> 00:30:20,995
Wait.

374
00:30:27,010 --> 00:30:29,001
You are nervous because

375
00:30:29,412 --> 00:30:30,310
I'm a woman, aren't you?
Or, I'm too young to do it?

376
00:30:30,914 --> 00:30:32,404
Both, Miss.

377
00:30:32,816 --> 00:30:34,306
Ok. I agree with you.

378
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:39,211
Well, can you tell me the first priority
of being a good pilot?

379
00:30:40,924 --> 00:30:41,720
Experience?

380
00:30:42,125 --> 00:30:44,025
No, inspiration, I think.

381
00:30:44,628 --> 00:30:47,119
Oh, I'm glad you didn't say experience.

382
00:30:47,731 --> 00:30:52,225
Anyway, I heard from grandpa
that you flew at an early age.

383
00:30:52,736 --> 00:30:54,829
And have been an excellent pilot since then.

384
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,933
That was 1910, when I was 17.

385
00:31:00,043 --> 00:31:02,341
17! That's the same age I am now.

386
00:31:03,647 --> 00:31:05,638
I can't quit being a woman,

387
00:31:06,049 --> 00:31:07,846
but let me do the job, will you?

388
00:31:08,652 --> 00:31:10,347
If I can't do it well, don't pay me.

389
00:31:11,354 --> 00:31:12,548
Is it ok, grandpa?

390
00:31:12,956 --> 00:31:14,753
She is my granddaughter, she'll do well.

391
00:31:15,458 --> 00:31:18,757
In my case, I was able
to fix engines at the age of 12.

392
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:21,455
Could you sleep here tonight?
I'll make your bed tomorrow.

393
00:31:21,765 --> 00:31:22,561
The breakfast is at 7:00am.

394
00:31:22,866 --> 00:31:23,560
You can take a hot shower.

395
00:31:23,867 --> 00:31:25,164
I've you left a towel already.
Have a good night.

396
00:31:28,572 --> 00:31:31,370
You don't have enough money.
We know each other well,

397
00:31:31,675 --> 00:31:33,575
so will make the rest a loan.

398
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:20,613
Good-morning. Did you sleep well?

399
00:32:20,924 --> 00:32:22,016
Did you stay up all night?

400
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:24,025
This is the rough plan.
What do you think?

401
00:32:24,728 --> 00:32:28,129
I want to redesign this wing section,
leaving the plane shape as it is.

402
00:32:29,232 --> 00:32:31,427
This will make your plane fly faster.

403
00:32:32,435 --> 00:32:34,232
I'm surprised at the original plan.

404
00:32:34,938 --> 00:32:36,838
The wing was also made of wood.

405
00:32:37,641 --> 00:32:39,131
This plane is great.

406
00:32:39,542 --> 00:32:42,636
The designer who designed
this wing must have know the wood very well.

407
00:32:43,747 --> 00:32:44,736
I'm really impressed.

408
00:32:45,548 --> 00:32:47,743
This is the only plane of its kind made,

409
00:32:48,852 --> 00:32:50,547
nobody used it,

410
00:32:51,955 --> 00:32:53,547
just put in the store room.

411
00:32:54,057 --> 00:32:54,955
No wonder!

412
00:32:55,959 --> 00:32:57,449
I'm surprised that this radical design

413
00:32:57,861 --> 00:32:59,260
allows you to take off from water surface.

414
00:33:00,063 --> 00:33:02,361
Only take offs and
landings give me some difficulty.

415
00:33:03,066 --> 00:33:04,966
It behaves strange during the flight.

416
00:33:06,169 --> 00:33:10,162
At 0.5 degrees to the angle
of the wings, right?

417
00:33:10,774 --> 00:33:12,674
Everything should be fine then.

418
00:33:13,076 --> 00:33:14,873
You'll let me continue with this,
won't you?

419
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:16,370
Thank you, Mr.! I'll do my best!

420
00:33:18,181 --> 00:33:20,672
But let me tell you something, Miss.

421
00:33:22,686 --> 00:33:23,778
Don't stay up all night.

422
00:33:24,187 --> 00:33:25,586
Insomnia prevents
you from doing an excellent job.

423
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:28,189
And it is not good for your beauty.

424
00:33:29,292 --> 00:33:30,589
Thank you for your advice.

425
00:33:32,195 --> 00:33:33,184
Well,

426
00:33:33,596 --> 00:33:35,689
to be honest,

427
00:33:36,099 --> 00:33:36,997
I couldn't sleep well last night.

428
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:40,096
I was worried that
you won't let me do this job.

429
00:33:40,503 --> 00:33:41,401
Well, I'm very sleepy now.

430
00:33:41,905 --> 00:33:43,099
I'll make a coffee for you.

431
00:33:45,508 --> 00:33:48,500
Is she going to build this plane alone?

432
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,712
Next is my niece, Monica.
She is will be in charge of general construction.

433
00:33:59,522 --> 00:34:00,011
Nice to meet you.

434
00:34:00,523 --> 00:34:02,423
This is a wife of my nephew, Silvana.

435
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:03,424
She is going to do finishing construction.

436
00:34:03,827 --> 00:34:04,225
These are daughters of my relatives.

437
00:34:04,527 --> 00:34:07,018
Sophia, Laura, Constance, Valentina.

438
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:09,022
This is Fio's elder sister, Giliora.

439
00:34:09,332 --> 00:34:11,323
Oh, you're looking for me?
This is Sandra, my cousin.

440
00:34:11,434 --> 00:34:12,526
You look so pretty Marietta.

441
00:34:13,236 --> 00:34:14,328
Wives of my sons,

442
00:34:14,738 --> 00:34:15,432
Maria,

443
00:34:15,739 --> 00:34:18,037
Tina, Anna, and her younger sister Birreta.

444
00:34:18,842 --> 00:34:19,934
Angelino!

445
00:34:20,343 --> 00:34:21,435
Grandma!

446
00:34:22,645 --> 00:34:24,340
Are you still alive?

447
00:34:26,449 --> 00:34:28,849
You've grown up to be a nice boy!

448
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:33,850
Are you ladies going to work?

449
00:34:35,358 --> 00:34:38,156
Yes, I'd like to have some money
for my great-grandchildren.

450
00:34:43,566 --> 00:34:45,363
There are no man here, right?

451
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:48,869
Ah...

452
00:34:49,272 --> 00:34:50,068
All these are your relatives?

453
00:34:50,473 --> 00:34:51,667
Yes, they don't have any jobs these days.

454
00:34:52,275 --> 00:34:54,072
All the men went to other places to work.

455
00:34:56,479 --> 00:34:57,969
Because of the 'Great Depression'?

456
00:34:58,882 --> 00:34:59,974
Don't worry.

457
00:35:00,383 --> 00:35:01,179
Girls are nice,

458
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:02,382
they work very well and are also gutsy.

459
00:35:02,786 --> 00:35:06,688
Making an airplane is in no way
like baking a cake, I think...

460
00:35:15,098 --> 00:35:17,089
Dear God.

461
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,591
You gave my company,
which was about to go bankrupt,

462
00:35:19,903 --> 00:35:21,598
a piece of bread and a job.

463
00:35:22,105 --> 00:35:26,508
Please forgive us,
who make a fighter plane with ladies.

464
00:35:26,810 --> 00:35:28,004
Amen.

465
00:35:30,914 --> 00:35:33,610
Well, let's eat well and work hard!

466
00:35:44,127 --> 00:35:47,119
Sounds good!
This engine is quite something!

467
00:35:54,537 --> 00:35:56,334
What do you say, it's nice, isn't it?

468
00:35:56,940 --> 00:35:59,932
Don't over do it
or this factory will be gone.

469
00:36:02,045 --> 00:36:04,445
Huh, you think Curtis is not worth it?

470
00:36:36,079 --> 00:36:37,171
Uh-hm, sure, this is a good idea.

471
00:36:38,481 --> 00:36:40,381
So, let me do it.

472
00:36:41,184 --> 00:36:43,675
But, this is going to cost a fortune.

473
00:36:44,487 --> 00:36:47,786
I got a lot of bills already.

474
00:36:48,691 --> 00:36:50,591
I'm not sure what sponsor thinks.

475
00:36:52,395 --> 00:36:53,589
Porco...

476
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:58,197
Ok, ok. Don't look at me like that.

477
00:36:59,002 --> 00:36:59,991
Do it your way.

478
00:37:00,503 --> 00:37:02,596
Yes! I've already talked to manufacturers.

479
00:37:03,006 --> 00:37:03,802
I will order these immediately.

480
00:37:04,507 --> 00:37:05,997
Porco, I love you!

481
00:37:10,413 --> 00:37:12,005
Wait at least three months, will you?

482
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:14,615
I want to change my job
and become an air pirate.

483
00:37:15,418 --> 00:37:16,612
She is a nice girl, isn't she.

484
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,714
Don't touch her.

485
00:37:19,422 --> 00:37:21,720
If I would be henpecked,
I could not feel happy.

486
00:38:36,699 --> 00:38:38,792
You're a major, ah.
You rose in the world, Fierrali.

487
00:38:39,202 --> 00:38:40,794
You, fool. Why did you come back?

488
00:38:41,904 --> 00:38:43,804
I make it a rule to go wherever I want to.

489
00:38:44,707 --> 00:38:46,504
The government is not going
to let you go this time.

490
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:48,804
Did somebody follow you?

491
00:38:49,212 --> 00:38:50,201
I gave them the slip.

492
00:38:50,913 --> 00:39:00,117
A warrant for your arrest
is going to be issued.

493
00:39:01,824 --> 00:39:03,223
Hey, this is no time to laugh.

494
00:39:04,727 --> 00:39:07,423
They say they will confiscate your plane.

495
00:39:08,531 --> 00:39:10,522
This movie is crap, don't you think.

496
00:39:11,434 --> 00:39:13,334
Hey, Marco, come back to the air force.

497
00:39:13,836 --> 00:39:16,327
I would make a room for you.

498
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,338
I'd rather be a pig then a fascist.

499
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,833
The era of sky adventures has gone.

500
00:39:22,245 --> 00:39:25,646
The only thing left for us to do is

501
00:39:27,550 --> 00:39:30,246
to fly for such ridiculous reasons
as the country or the nation.

502
00:39:31,654 --> 00:39:34,054
You are a pig after all, huh?

503
00:39:34,957 --> 00:39:38,358
Thanks for your advice, Fierrali.
Give my regards to the others.

504
00:39:39,962 --> 00:39:42,760
This is a nice film, don't you think.
Watch your tail cowboy.

505
00:39:43,266 --> 00:39:45,564
They don't sue a pigs, but...

506
00:39:47,570 --> 00:39:49,367
Goodbye, my comrade.

507
00:40:07,890 --> 00:40:08,982
Porco, need a ride?

508
00:40:14,397 --> 00:40:15,796
Hey, you're a life saver.

509
00:40:22,205 --> 00:40:24,605
I borrowed this because
I need to take your plane to the lake tomorrow.

510
00:40:25,508 --> 00:40:26,805
It's for a test flight, right?

511
00:40:27,510 --> 00:40:29,910
I don't need the test flight.
I need to fly as soon as possible.

512
00:40:31,214 --> 00:40:32,203
Don't be such a fool.

513
00:40:32,615 --> 00:40:34,412
I'm not going to give you the plane
without testing it.

514
00:40:35,218 --> 00:40:38,415
Besides, it will take almost a day
to take it apart and transport it to the lake.

515
00:40:38,721 --> 00:40:39,710
We don't have much time.

516
00:40:40,223 --> 00:40:41,815
Take a look back, will you, slowly.

517
00:40:42,625 --> 00:40:46,925
That's the fascists secret police.

518
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:49,725
They were following you, Fio.

519
00:40:50,633 --> 00:40:52,624
Me? Why? For what?

520
00:40:53,436 --> 00:40:55,028
Because I gave them the slip.

521
00:40:55,638 --> 00:40:58,334
And, because you are working on my plane.

522
00:41:02,545 --> 00:41:04,445
Porco, are you really a spy?

523
00:41:09,051 --> 00:41:10,951
Ha, ha, ha, ha! l? A spy?
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

524
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:16,252
Look, a secret agent works much harder then l.

525
00:41:16,659 --> 00:41:18,957
But, you were a hero at the time of war.

526
00:41:19,862 --> 00:41:22,160
This is strange if you didn't do anything...

527
00:41:22,465 --> 00:41:24,558
I think so, too.

528
00:41:29,372 --> 00:41:30,566
This is not right way!

529
00:41:42,985 --> 00:41:44,976
Looks like your used to being in big trouble.

530
00:41:46,489 --> 00:41:47,979
Well, we will be very busy.

531
00:42:18,120 --> 00:42:19,109
You can fly anytime you want.

532
00:42:19,622 --> 00:42:21,021
Two guys are hiding in the backyard,

533
00:42:21,324 --> 00:42:22,518
and three in the front.

534
00:42:23,226 --> 00:42:26,024
This excites me!

535
00:42:26,329 --> 00:42:27,227
Hey, don't ramble.

536
00:42:30,533 --> 00:42:31,227
See you later.

537
00:42:31,734 --> 00:42:32,029
Take care of yourself.

538
00:42:44,347 --> 00:42:45,644
Fio! What are you doing?

539
00:42:46,549 --> 00:42:49,245
I'm going, too. Wait for five minutes, please!
I want to prepare my seat.

540
00:42:50,753 --> 00:42:54,348
Give me a break!
Do you understand what you are saying!

541
00:42:55,258 --> 00:42:56,657
Shh... Don't talk so loud.

542
00:42:57,260 --> 00:42:58,056
Fio.

543
00:43:01,264 --> 00:43:05,257
Look. You are a daughter of a decent man.
Besides, you are not married yet.

544
00:43:05,568 --> 00:43:06,660
Would you hold this for a moment?

545
00:43:08,170 --> 00:43:10,365
Thank you. I made this in a hurry, look!

546
00:43:10,873 --> 00:43:12,170
This really fits.

547
00:43:16,078 --> 00:43:19,479
Would you hold that?

548
00:43:21,384 --> 00:43:24,876
Hey, Miss. I'm a wanted
bounty hunter by the government.

549
00:43:25,588 --> 00:43:26,885
I'm not going to be playing with this plane.

550
00:43:28,491 --> 00:43:29,389
I'm sorry,

551
00:43:29,992 --> 00:43:32,085
but I have responsibility for this plane.

552
00:43:32,495 --> 00:43:34,395
But, I'm going to take off from the canal

553
00:43:35,298 --> 00:43:36,890
in the back.

554
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,691
And I'm not even sure
if I can fly without any problems.

555
00:43:40,403 --> 00:43:45,397
And, when you're going to fight Curtis
you'll need me as an excellent engineer.

556
00:43:46,609 --> 00:43:47,507
Hey, I'm a man, you know.

557
00:43:48,110 --> 00:43:50,408
We are going to be
camping alone on a deserted island.

558
00:43:50,913 --> 00:43:52,608
I don't care,
I like camping very much.

559
00:43:53,215 --> 00:43:54,807
I'm not talking about THAT.

560
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:57,411
Take her with you.

561
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,411
I want you to win and pay the debt.
You've got to beat Curtis

562
00:44:01,223 --> 00:44:03,817
My company may go bankrupt
if you don't pay it.

563
00:44:04,226 --> 00:44:06,023
Are you really
this girl's grandfather?

564
00:44:06,429 --> 00:44:10,331
You don't have to pay her any money.
I'm going to install this phone for you two.

565
00:44:11,033 --> 00:44:13,831
You really want her to
be wanted by the police.

566
00:44:14,637 --> 00:44:16,229
No. I'm going to be Porco's hostage.

567
00:44:16,939 --> 00:44:19,032
That way they can excuse

568
00:44:19,642 --> 00:44:21,337
their cooperation with you.

569
00:44:23,045 --> 00:44:26,640
So, please, take me with you.

570
00:44:29,952 --> 00:44:31,544
Take off the machine gun on the right side.

571
00:44:31,854 --> 00:44:32,650
What? There's almost no space

572
00:44:33,155 --> 00:44:35,055
even if you got a small butt.

573
00:44:35,358 --> 00:44:37,553
Take off one machine gun!

574
00:44:37,860 --> 00:44:40,658
Whoa! Thanks! My butt is bigger then it looks.

575
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:42,057
It will be just a minute
for me to take the gun off.

576
00:44:43,766 --> 00:44:44,960
I want to take off as soon as possible.

577
00:44:45,368 --> 00:44:47,268
If I don't do it,
looks like the old ladies are gonna say

578
00:44:47,870 --> 00:44:48,859
they want to come with me as well.

579
00:44:52,675 --> 00:44:53,972
Grandma, hurry, hurry.

580
00:44:54,477 --> 00:44:56,069
Fio. You don't have get me a souvenir.

581
00:45:05,788 --> 00:45:07,779
Contact.

582
00:45:16,899 --> 00:45:19,595
Open the door!

583
00:45:26,509 --> 00:45:27,601
Let it go!

584
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:51,827
Give me money!

585
00:46:00,242 --> 00:46:01,539
How is the steering, Porco?

586
00:46:02,044 --> 00:46:05,536
This is kind of like a tomboy,
just like you.

587
00:46:09,251 --> 00:46:11,151
Stop the plane at once!
We need to make adjustments!

588
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:14,248
We don't have the time to do it.
Just do your job!

589
00:46:18,461 --> 00:46:19,655
It's wet with water.

590
00:46:21,063 --> 00:46:22,155
There a ship up ahead!

591
00:46:26,168 --> 00:46:27,260
Let's fly!

592
00:46:30,873 --> 00:46:32,170
Easy, easy, tomboy!

593
00:46:32,775 --> 00:46:34,868
The turning wing is shifting to the right.
Use the tab!

594
00:46:35,377 --> 00:46:36,071
The tab?

595
00:46:36,378 --> 00:46:37,174
The one I put in anew!

596
00:46:39,081 --> 00:46:40,173
Hurry!

597
00:46:52,795 --> 00:46:54,786
Good. It became a nice boy all of a sudden.

598
00:47:30,733 --> 00:47:31,529
Beautiful.

599
00:47:32,134 --> 00:47:33,533
How beautiful the world is!?

600
00:47:38,340 --> 00:47:39,238
Is he following us?

601
00:47:39,842 --> 00:47:41,332
No. He is not attacking.

602
00:47:42,745 --> 00:47:45,236
That's a parade plane of the
ltalian Air Force.

603
00:47:46,448 --> 00:47:47,540
Looks like it's Fierrali...

604
00:47:53,956 --> 00:47:54,854
Do you know him?

605
00:47:55,357 --> 00:47:57,154
The Air Force lies in wait up ahead.

606
00:47:57,860 --> 00:47:59,350
He says he'll tell us how to escape them.

607
00:48:18,781 --> 00:48:21,272
He also says that
we should fly low to the Adriatic Sea.

608
00:48:22,084 --> 00:48:23,676
Thanks, comrade!

609
00:48:24,386 --> 00:48:26,684
Thank you!

610
00:48:33,996 --> 00:48:35,588
He said,
Don't cast pearls before a swine,

611
00:48:35,898 --> 00:48:37,388
Iooking at you, Fio.

612
00:49:43,966 --> 00:49:45,263
You are so beautiful.

613
00:49:46,368 --> 00:49:50,270
You look like a rose blooming
in a secret flower garden.

614
00:49:53,876 --> 00:49:56,572
You, bastard! This is private garden.

615
00:49:57,379 --> 00:49:59,074
I really want you to look at this.

616
00:50:06,188 --> 00:50:07,678
Oh, this is from Hollywood.

617
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:11,689
About the production
of the scenario and casting you sent,

618
00:50:12,294 --> 00:50:15,388
we are in the middle of preliminary trials

619
00:50:16,298 --> 00:50:18,789
The title is A bouquet of the Adriatic Sea.

620
00:50:19,802 --> 00:50:20,496
That's nice.

621
00:50:21,403 --> 00:50:23,098
Really? That means O.K., doesn't it?

622
00:50:23,405 --> 00:50:25,305
Gina, come to Hollywood with me.

623
00:50:27,609 --> 00:50:31,306
I was air pirates' guardsman
to obtain a fame and fortune.

624
00:50:32,414 --> 00:50:34,609
Next I want to be a Hollywood star.

625
00:50:35,117 --> 00:50:36,106
And, then?

626
00:50:36,819 --> 00:50:38,013
The President!

627
00:50:46,028 --> 00:50:46,926
I'm serious.

628
00:50:47,830 --> 00:50:50,230
I promise to make you the first lady.

629
00:50:51,433 --> 00:50:52,422
Gina.

630
00:50:53,736 --> 00:50:56,136
I like your for such stupidity.

631
00:50:56,538 --> 00:50:57,232
Really?

632
00:50:58,941 --> 00:50:59,839
But I say no,

633
00:51:00,442 --> 00:51:01,932
because I already have a gamble going.

634
00:51:05,547 --> 00:51:12,043
When I'm in this garden,
if he comes over here, I will love him.

635
00:51:12,855 --> 00:51:16,052
But he comes only to the
restaurant at night.

636
00:51:16,759 --> 00:51:18,750
And never emerges in the daylight.

637
00:52:01,904 --> 00:52:03,496
That guy is coming back.

638
00:53:04,266 --> 00:53:05,164
Fool...

639
00:53:15,177 --> 00:53:18,476
He left without getting off the plane.
I lost the gamble again.

640
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:21,374
You're kidding!
The gamble is about that guy?

641
00:53:22,384 --> 00:53:23,476
Is that a problem?

642
00:53:24,386 --> 00:53:27,685
Life is more complicated
here than in your country.

643
00:53:28,490 --> 00:53:30,287
Here I can fall in love anytime I want.

644
00:53:31,593 --> 00:53:34,084
Kid, go to Hollywood by yourself, OK?

645
00:53:34,696 --> 00:53:35,890
Kid...

646
00:53:40,602 --> 00:53:43,298
I hit my head because you did an acrobatic
maneuver all of a sudden.

647
00:53:44,206 --> 00:53:45,798
I just said hello to my friend.

648
00:53:46,408 --> 00:53:48,103
To Gina of the hotel Adriano?

649
00:53:49,711 --> 00:53:52,111
She wore a white dress and
was at the terrace of the hotel, wasn't she?

650
00:53:52,714 --> 00:53:54,011
My grandpa told me that

651
00:53:54,516 --> 00:53:57,815
all pilots of the Adriatic Sea
fall in love with Gina

652
00:53:58,220 --> 00:53:59,812
You speculate a lot.

653
00:54:01,924 --> 00:54:03,016
So, how is the lady?

654
00:54:03,625 --> 00:54:04,717
You fell in love with her too,
didn't you?

655
00:54:05,327 --> 00:54:06,521
We are going down refuel.

656
00:54:06,828 --> 00:54:08,420
Close your mouth,
or you'll bite your tongue.

657
00:54:08,730 --> 00:54:09,719
Wa! Wait! Uwaa...

658
00:54:35,157 --> 00:54:37,250
A girl on a fighter?

659
00:54:39,061 --> 00:54:40,050
Where's Porco?

660
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:42,159
He is talking with my dad.

661
00:54:43,065 --> 00:54:44,464
Not only the temporary government

662
00:54:45,167 --> 00:54:50,867
but guys in the King's faction have

663
00:54:51,573 --> 00:54:54,872
tried to get along with the air pirates.

664
00:54:55,177 --> 00:54:56,166
Here you are.

665
00:54:56,578 --> 00:54:57,169
Thanks.

666
00:54:57,779 --> 00:54:59,576
No thanks for such a bad news...

667
00:55:01,183 --> 00:55:03,674
You'd better present yourself to either side.

668
00:55:03,885 --> 00:55:06,683
They will pay a fortune for your skill.

669
00:55:07,189 --> 00:55:08,281
You got a cigarette?

670
00:55:08,790 --> 00:55:11,281
Curtis is will go back to
America sooner or later.

671
00:55:11,893 --> 00:55:14,885
It's us who should to go to America.

672
00:55:16,498 --> 00:55:17,795
Goodbye

673
00:55:18,200 --> 00:55:19,895
to freedom in the Adriatic Sea.

674
00:55:20,702 --> 00:55:21,794
Is it Byron's?

675
00:55:22,104 --> 00:55:23,799
No, it's mine.

676
00:55:24,106 --> 00:55:24,697
See you later.

677
00:55:28,610 --> 00:55:30,100
Porco, this is bad news.

678
00:55:30,912 --> 00:55:34,109
The gas price is three times
as much as in ltaly.

679
00:55:36,018 --> 00:55:37,713
Don't be like a businessman,
make it cheaper.

680
00:55:38,520 --> 00:55:40,112
This gas is genuine.

681
00:55:40,822 --> 00:55:42,414
That's why I hate women.

682
00:55:43,825 --> 00:55:44,416
Hey, Mr. Would you tell her...

683
00:55:45,227 --> 00:55:46,421
Pay him, Fio.

684
00:55:47,329 --> 00:55:51,026
After that, put your big butt and your looks
in the space between the machine guns.

685
00:55:52,134 --> 00:55:53,624
We're going to fly to my home.

686
00:55:54,236 --> 00:55:56,534
I'll add the gas bill to the other bills.

687
00:56:02,744 --> 00:56:05,440
Nobody can live alone.
We rely on each other.

688
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:10,946
Nobody lives around here,
even though the landscape is beautiful.

689
00:56:14,156 --> 00:56:16,351
Here we are.
That island is my home.

690
00:56:36,878 --> 00:56:37,674
It's a wonderful place.

691
00:56:54,796 --> 00:56:55,990
An excellent co-ordinator.

692
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,900
Ohh... my butt is stiff from the long flight.

693
00:57:09,811 --> 00:57:10,607
The pig...

694
00:57:15,417 --> 00:57:16,213
Don't move!

695
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:20,315
They stinks, again...

696
00:57:21,022 --> 00:57:23,820
Boss, we caught him! Boss!

697
00:57:24,226 --> 00:57:26,126
Shit! Don't step on me... Back off!

698
00:57:26,628 --> 00:57:30,120
I was waiting for you, pig!

699
00:57:30,532 --> 00:57:31,829
I knew you'd coming here.

700
00:57:32,234 --> 00:57:33,633
You gave us a lot of trouble.

701
00:57:35,337 --> 00:57:36,133
It's a girl.

702
00:57:36,538 --> 00:57:37,630
The pig is with a girl.

703
00:57:38,140 --> 00:57:39,334
She is pretty...

704
00:57:39,741 --> 00:57:41,641
Shut up! What's about a girl?

705
00:57:42,043 --> 00:57:43,533
About a half of the worlds
population are women!

706
00:57:44,045 --> 00:57:46,343
Hey, that girl is not an ordinary one.

707
00:57:46,948 --> 00:57:48,745
She is a chief engineer
at the Piccolo company.

708
00:57:49,651 --> 00:57:51,949
But, she is very young and pretty.

709
00:57:52,654 --> 00:57:54,053
That girl?

710
00:57:54,556 --> 00:57:57,354
She made my plane much better then before.

711
00:57:58,059 --> 00:57:59,549
She may be young, but she's really something.

712
00:58:01,463 --> 00:58:02,657
Is that true?

713
00:58:03,465 --> 00:58:05,365
You are good with airplanes in general.

714
00:58:05,967 --> 00:58:09,664
Be polite, boys.
She came with me to collect my debts.

715
00:58:11,373 --> 00:58:13,773
You are deeply in debt after all.

716
00:58:14,276 --> 00:58:19,077
It serves you right!

717
00:58:21,082 --> 00:58:22,071
Damage?

718
00:58:22,484 --> 00:58:23,883
Are you going to break the plane I made?

719
00:58:25,086 --> 00:58:27,281
Are you going to break
such beautiful airplane with axes?

720
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:31,284
Miss,
there is a complicated reason behind this...

721
00:58:31,693 --> 00:58:32,682
You are going to break, aren't you?

722
00:58:33,094 --> 00:58:34,186
But, what I want to say is...

723
00:58:34,596 --> 00:58:36,689
Are you guys really fighter pilots?

724
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:39,292
Would you back off? My shoes.

725
00:58:47,909 --> 00:58:52,005
I have grown up with a lot of stories
about the pilots since I was a small child.

726
00:58:52,914 --> 00:58:57,408
My grandpa always told me that
no one is as nice as the pilots.

727
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:01,912
It's because sea and
sky purify their hearts.

728
00:59:03,225 --> 00:59:06,626
Hence, the pilots are much
braver then the sailors,

729
00:59:06,928 --> 00:59:09,021
and more proud then the ordinary pilots

730
00:59:09,431 --> 00:59:11,533
Don't tell me.

731
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:15,025
I know that.

732
00:59:15,637 --> 00:59:18,731
What they want the most, he said,
is neither money nor women,

733
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:20,235
but honor.

734
00:59:20,642 --> 00:59:21,631
Yes,

735
00:59:21,943 --> 00:59:23,137
you're right!

736
00:59:23,845 --> 00:59:25,142
A toast to the pilots!

737
00:59:27,048 --> 00:59:29,141
She's really something.

738
00:59:29,751 --> 00:59:30,843
I understand.

739
00:59:31,453 --> 00:59:34,149
I'll give up on breaking the plane,
you made, with axes.

740
00:59:34,856 --> 00:59:38,451
But we'll be mortified
if we don't do anything.

741
00:59:39,060 --> 00:59:40,652
Let's lynch the pig!

742
00:59:41,663 --> 00:59:43,654
Lynch the pig!

743
00:59:44,866 --> 00:59:46,356
What the hell you talking about!

744
00:59:47,068 --> 00:59:48,057
You guys don't understand anything.

745
00:59:48,570 --> 00:59:50,470
I asked whether you feel ashamed or not.

746
00:59:51,172 --> 00:59:53,470
Aren't you ashamed of being helped by Curtis,
the American?

747
00:59:54,175 --> 00:59:55,870
If your mother heard of that,
she would cry,

748
00:59:56,378 --> 00:59:57,572
and don't even take a shower.

749
00:59:58,380 --> 01:00:01,577
Porco came back to fight against Curtis,

750
01:00:01,783 --> 01:00:05,879
for pride and honor of the
pilots of the Adriatic.

751
01:00:06,688 --> 01:00:10,681
You guys are lowest of the low!

752
01:00:12,193 --> 01:00:14,889
I told you not to hire Curtis, eh!

753
01:00:15,397 --> 01:00:16,796
Just like a girl.

754
01:00:17,299 --> 01:00:18,391
Don't try to excuse yourself.

755
01:00:18,800 --> 01:00:19,698
Boss, what are we supposed to do?

756
01:00:20,201 --> 01:00:21,793
She convinced us.

757
01:00:22,304 --> 01:00:27,105
How about asking Curtis to fight the pig?

758
01:00:27,509 --> 01:00:29,306
Do we ask him to fight the PIG, again?

759
01:00:29,811 --> 01:00:31,301
The contract is already over.

760
01:00:32,514 --> 01:00:34,414
I'm ashamed of it...

761
01:00:38,320 --> 01:00:39,514
That's Curtis!

762
01:00:43,224 --> 01:00:44,418
I got it.

763
01:00:45,126 --> 01:00:47,117
I'm not going to run away!

764
01:00:48,930 --> 01:00:53,731
You made your passage through there?

765
01:01:03,645 --> 01:01:04,839
Hey, hold this.

766
01:01:09,751 --> 01:01:12,151
You want a return match, don't you.

767
01:01:12,554 --> 01:01:15,455
But I won once, already.

768
01:01:15,757 --> 01:01:18,555
Besides, I am not a bounty hunter
for these guys.

769
01:01:18,860 --> 01:01:20,851
What's your proposition?

770
01:01:31,873 --> 01:01:33,067
Beautiful!

771
01:01:34,476 --> 01:01:36,569
Will you marry me if I win?

772
01:01:40,382 --> 01:01:41,474
I'm serious.

773
01:01:41,983 --> 01:01:42,881
O.K.

774
01:01:43,284 --> 01:01:46,879
Instead, if Porco wins,
you pay these bills.

775
01:01:47,188 --> 01:01:48,780
Wait, Fio!

776
01:01:49,290 --> 01:01:50,279
You back off!

777
01:01:54,696 --> 01:01:57,096
Miss, you still have time
to think about that.

778
01:01:57,298 --> 01:01:58,492
Ask him, not me.

779
01:01:59,100 --> 01:02:00,590
This is very expensive.

780
01:02:01,002 --> 01:02:01,798
It's very cheap.

781
01:02:02,504 --> 01:02:03,402
Are you going to fight or not?

782
01:02:04,806 --> 01:02:05,898
I'm willing to fight

783
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:07,001
for love.

784
01:02:07,409 --> 01:02:08,398
O.K.

785
01:02:09,611 --> 01:02:11,010
Listen up everybody.

786
01:02:11,413 --> 01:02:13,313
I'm really impressed
with Miss Fio's decision.

787
01:02:13,915 --> 01:02:16,713
We, 'Mamma Aiuto',
are going to back up this fight up!

788
01:02:17,118 --> 01:02:18,813
Yes...

789
01:02:19,220 --> 01:02:20,414
Let the air pirates union do this, too!

790
01:02:20,722 --> 01:02:22,314
Yes...

791
01:02:25,827 --> 01:02:29,024
Miss Fio! See you soon!

792
01:02:30,932 --> 01:02:32,024
This sucks!

793
01:02:32,534 --> 01:02:35,025
Hey pig, don't run away!

794
01:02:35,437 --> 01:02:38,531
Shut up, get lost!

795
01:02:39,641 --> 01:02:41,438
Bye-bye!

796
01:02:44,446 --> 01:02:49,042
This is ridiculous. Well, you are.....

797
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:53,548
Don't tell me. I know, I am foolish.

798
01:03:00,161 --> 01:03:01,059
Fio,

799
01:03:01,763 --> 01:03:04,755
I think I have to say thank you.

800
01:03:05,567 --> 01:03:07,159
You gave me a chance to fight Curtis.

801
01:03:07,869 --> 01:03:08,858
Thanks.

802
01:03:09,471 --> 01:03:11,462
We share the same luck.

803
01:03:12,373 --> 01:03:13,670
We are partners, aren't we?

804
01:03:15,777 --> 01:03:17,472
We are going to have a hard time.

805
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:20,377
I trust you.

806
01:03:22,283 --> 01:03:25,377
Trust me, eh?
I haven't heard that in a long time,

807
01:03:25,787 --> 01:03:27,379
but I'm glad you said that.

808
01:03:33,394 --> 01:03:35,794
What's wrong? You feel sick?

809
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:37,389
Fio?

810
01:03:37,899 --> 01:03:38,888
I'm fine.

811
01:03:39,901 --> 01:03:43,098
It's just that my heart is pounding.

812
01:03:43,805 --> 01:03:49,004
To be honest, I was really scared.

813
01:03:52,914 --> 01:03:54,404
Hey?

814
01:03:54,716 --> 01:03:55,910
I want to swim.

815
01:04:14,936 --> 01:04:16,528
Porco! I made a mistake!

816
01:04:17,138 --> 01:04:18,127
Are you O.K?

817
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,736
I should have padded the deal.

818
01:04:22,944 --> 01:04:24,639
We have a bad bargain.

819
01:04:28,349 --> 01:04:30,442
HA,HA,HA,HA.
You're right. HA,HA,HA,HA.

820
01:05:23,805 --> 01:05:25,102
Porco....

821
01:05:25,206 --> 01:05:25,695
Hmm?

822
01:05:26,808 --> 01:05:27,797
You can't sleep, can you?

823
01:05:29,410 --> 01:05:33,506
Now, I just saw...
It may have been a dream...

824
01:05:35,216 --> 01:05:36,410
Every thing is all right.

825
01:05:36,918 --> 01:05:38,215
It's too early in the morning to get up.

826
01:05:39,621 --> 01:05:40,815
Porco.

827
01:05:41,322 --> 01:05:43,313
Why did you become a pig?

828
01:05:44,025 --> 01:05:45,617
I don't know.

829
01:05:46,928 --> 01:05:50,227
I know a lot about Captain Marco Pabatto.

830
01:05:50,632 --> 01:05:52,930
My father used to be in the same unit.

831
01:05:53,334 --> 01:05:55,427
I've heard many a story,
in which the captain

832
01:05:55,837 --> 01:05:59,830
saved lives of enemy pilots,
I liked it.

833
01:06:04,746 --> 01:06:06,646
Porco! How about if I kiss you?

834
01:06:08,549 --> 01:06:12,041
You know a fairy tale
where a princess takes off

835
01:06:12,453 --> 01:06:13,943
a curse on a prince,
who was changed to a frog.

836
01:06:14,355 --> 01:06:17,847
You, silly. Save it for your man!

837
01:06:19,961 --> 01:06:21,656
Won't my kiss work?

838
01:06:24,265 --> 01:06:25,857
Huh, you are a nice girl.

839
01:06:26,367 --> 01:06:27,664
You make me feel comfortable

840
01:06:28,069 --> 01:06:30,765
and make me wish
to be a human being again.

841
01:06:31,773 --> 01:06:33,570
Be a nice girl and go to sleep.

842
01:06:33,875 --> 01:06:35,968
Tell me your story and I will.

843
01:06:37,779 --> 01:06:38,973
My story?

844
01:06:41,382 --> 01:06:42,474
Well...

845
01:06:51,392 --> 01:06:54,589
It was the last summer of the war.

846
01:06:55,396 --> 01:07:01,392
We were fly over the Adriatic Sea
on our usual patrol.

847
01:07:06,708 --> 01:07:09,506
Belneldi was flying on my right side.

848
01:07:10,011 --> 01:07:13,811
He was an old friend of mine.
He got married just two days before.

849
01:07:15,616 --> 01:07:18,608
I was the matchmaker.

850
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:20,710
He didn't have enough leave
to be with his wife for long.

851
01:07:21,122 --> 01:07:23,522
So, he returned to duty.

852
01:07:43,845 --> 01:07:46,939
Everyone was falling down like flies,
whether a friend or a foe.

853
01:07:47,749 --> 01:07:50,047
I was chased by three planes,

854
01:07:51,052 --> 01:07:53,145
and had no time to worry about my friend.

855
01:07:53,855 --> 01:07:56,449
At the end I was the only one
remaining of my unit.

856
01:07:56,958 --> 01:07:59,051
But, they never gave up chasing me.

857
01:07:59,660 --> 01:08:01,252
I made desperate efforts to run away.

858
01:08:02,063 --> 01:08:03,655
My hands and feet went numb,

859
01:08:04,065 --> 01:08:07,159
and I grew dizzy.
I thought I was going to die.

860
01:08:07,668 --> 01:08:08,862
It was at that time that

861
01:08:09,370 --> 01:08:11,565
I saw the white sky.

862
01:08:12,073 --> 01:08:13,165
White?

863
01:08:14,175 --> 01:08:15,972
Yeah, it was like a flash.

864
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:22,177
Because of the brightness,
it took me a while to realize that I was in a cloud.

865
01:08:23,184 --> 01:08:26,881
I was worn out, and
didn't have any power left to control my plane.

866
01:08:27,889 --> 01:08:30,790
In spite of that my plane continued to fly.

867
01:08:57,418 --> 01:08:59,113
A cloud of planes...

868
01:09:01,022 --> 01:09:02,421
Yeah, it was calm,

869
01:09:02,924 --> 01:09:04,721
and the sky was very clear, too clear.

870
01:09:05,626 --> 01:09:10,723
There was a line of clouds far above me.

871
01:09:38,259 --> 01:09:40,159
Belneldi, you are alive, aren't you!

872
01:09:44,165 --> 01:09:46,258
Belneldi, wait, where are you going!

873
01:09:59,580 --> 01:10:02,572
Belneldi, don't go!
Are you going to leave Gina alone?!

874
01:10:03,584 --> 01:10:04,881
I'll go instead of you!

875
01:10:45,226 --> 01:10:49,925
When I recovered my senses, I was flying
over the sea, almost touching it, alone.

876
01:10:53,734 --> 01:10:56,225
God said it wasn't your time yet,
didn't he?

877
01:10:58,539 --> 01:11:03,033
In my mind I thought he might
let me fly like that forever.

878
01:11:03,444 --> 01:11:05,435
That would not have been right,
because your are a good guy!

879
01:11:06,447 --> 01:11:08,938
Good guys are all dead already.

880
01:11:09,550 --> 01:11:11,450
Besides, there might have been
Hell inside that cloud.

881
01:11:12,153 --> 01:11:15,145
Well, my story is over.
Go to sleep.

882
01:11:17,658 --> 01:11:20,456
Shit, they gave me crap...

883
01:11:22,563 --> 01:11:25,157
I'm glad you came back to live

884
01:11:25,666 --> 01:11:27,463
because I like you.

885
01:11:29,270 --> 01:11:30,168
Good-night!

886
01:11:54,395 --> 01:11:55,589
Hey, hey, which one's gonna win,
a pig or...

887
01:11:55,896 --> 01:11:57,693
08:07

888
01:12:01,402 --> 01:12:03,495
you need ice-cream, telescope?

889
01:12:12,213 --> 01:12:14,909
Fools. They make our fight into a festival.

890
01:12:15,416 --> 01:12:17,008
Are they all air pirates?

891
01:12:17,518 --> 01:12:19,008
Trash of the Mediterranean Sea...

892
01:12:19,620 --> 01:12:25,422
Gangs, pirates, smugglers,
spies and even some ordinary people.

893
01:12:27,028 --> 01:12:29,428
Heh, this makes my fame rise more and more...

894
01:12:30,731 --> 01:12:33,632
Ten minutes till start,
ten minutes till start!

895
01:12:34,935 --> 01:12:39,429
This is the fight between Porco Rosso
and Donald Curtis!

896
01:12:40,241 --> 01:12:41,640
There are no special rules,

897
01:12:42,043 --> 01:12:45,945
but an unfair fight will a
disgrace to their fans.

898
01:12:46,847 --> 01:12:48,439
Shut up and start right now. Back off!

899
01:12:53,754 --> 01:12:57,554
You shut up, or I kill you!

900
01:13:06,867 --> 01:13:08,858
He'd be better off throwing a 10ton bomb...

901
01:13:09,570 --> 01:13:13,666
This is the fight which will determine
the future of Miss Fio Piccolo.

902
01:13:14,175 --> 01:13:15,665
Shut up!

903
01:13:16,577 --> 01:13:17,566
Do you understand?

904
01:13:17,978 --> 01:13:19,275
If you do, clap your hands.

905
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,476
CLAP!

906
01:13:24,685 --> 01:13:32,387
Shut up, that's the routine.
Well, both of you present your bids.

907
01:13:36,697 --> 01:13:37,391
Have a seat.

908
01:13:37,698 --> 01:13:38,392
Thank you.

909
01:13:39,300 --> 01:13:40,892
Put it on the chair properly!

910
01:13:43,704 --> 01:13:47,504
None of you have anything to say, do you.
Well shake hands or something before you start!

911
01:13:48,209 --> 01:13:51,007
No way. I'm fond of cleanliness.

912
01:13:53,414 --> 01:13:56,008
He's hard to please.

913
01:13:56,317 --> 01:13:58,512
Fio, as soon as this fight is over,
we will go to the church.

914
01:14:00,221 --> 01:14:03,918
Don't worry.
My mom told me your going to like me soon.

915
01:14:09,330 --> 01:14:10,024
You...

916
01:14:10,331 --> 01:14:11,821
May I take a picture with you?

917
01:14:12,133 --> 01:14:13,031
I took a shower already.

918
01:14:13,434 --> 01:14:14,833
Everybody, smile!

919
01:14:15,436 --> 01:14:17,233
SMILE!

920
01:14:38,559 --> 01:14:41,357
If the flight is over in 3 minutes,
the black plane has the advantage...

921
01:14:42,163 --> 01:14:45,655
This is great.
I want them to do this event every month

922
01:14:48,469 --> 01:14:50,460
15 seconds to go.

923
01:14:54,775 --> 01:14:55,867
They are so cool...

924
01:14:57,878 --> 01:14:58,776
5 seconds to go.

925
01:14:59,380 --> 01:15:03,578
4 , 3, 2, 1, 0!

926
01:15:12,193 --> 01:15:13,490
Curtis took over!

927
01:15:31,612 --> 01:15:33,409
This is going to be a one-sided fight.

928
01:15:33,814 --> 01:15:34,803
Give me that.

929
01:15:41,322 --> 01:15:43,722
Porco, what are you doing! Fly over!

930
01:15:44,124 --> 01:15:46,115
He would be shot if the took off now.

931
01:15:46,627 --> 01:15:48,618
It's very difficult for Curtis
to shoot Porco in this situation.

932
01:15:55,336 --> 01:15:57,827
I know you want me to waste the bullet's.
I know it.

933
01:16:14,154 --> 01:16:16,349
Looping! The pig took Curtis' back!

934
01:16:17,157 --> 01:16:18,146
Looping?

935
01:16:18,659 --> 01:16:20,957
His skill made the pig
an ace of the Adriatic Sea.

936
01:16:26,467 --> 01:16:27,263
Shit!

937
01:16:33,574 --> 01:16:34,472
He's gonna shoot!

938
01:16:39,380 --> 01:16:40,278
He doesn't open fire.

939
01:16:40,681 --> 01:16:41,670
Is his machine-gun broken!?

940
01:16:42,182 --> 01:16:43,376
I got it, I got it!

941
01:16:44,084 --> 01:16:45,881
The pig won't shoot until the end.

942
01:16:47,087 --> 01:16:48,384
The pig doesn't kill anybody.

943
01:16:49,390 --> 01:16:51,381
Now, the American should be fine.

944
01:16:51,992 --> 01:16:53,084
You got it! Go and shoot!

945
01:16:53,894 --> 01:16:56,886
Oh, he didn't shoot yet.... See,
I told you...

946
01:16:57,798 --> 01:16:59,993
If the pig opened fire,
it would kill the American, so, it's going to hit

947
01:17:00,501 --> 01:17:04,494
Curtis' engine a few bullets
after Curtis gets tired.

948
01:17:05,205 --> 01:17:08,197
He said this is not war, but...

949
01:17:08,609 --> 01:17:09,405
Porco...

950
01:17:10,611 --> 01:17:12,010
Are you teasing me or what?

951
01:17:12,513 --> 01:17:13,411
Come on!

952
01:17:14,815 --> 01:17:19,309
Is your gun broken, huh! You,
poor bastard!

953
01:17:24,625 --> 01:17:26,024
They are coming this way!

954
01:17:29,129 --> 01:17:31,529
Come on, pig!

955
01:17:36,637 --> 01:17:37,626
Go away from here and fight over there!

956
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:40,433
Great! The pig is leaving a cloud trail.

957
01:17:42,242 --> 01:17:43,539
Come on!

958
01:17:53,654 --> 01:17:55,349
Shoot that side!

959
01:18:00,361 --> 01:18:02,955
It's cool! It's the first time
I saw the plance leaving a cloud trail!

960
01:18:09,269 --> 01:18:12,864
I've never seen such an air fight before.

961
01:18:13,173 --> 01:18:14,470
I'm really impressed.

962
01:18:23,384 --> 01:18:25,477
I ready for the flight.

963
01:18:25,886 --> 01:18:27,080
She'd better hurry,
or the fight will be over.

964
01:18:27,688 --> 01:18:29,679
She's in her room, and doesn't come out.

965
01:18:30,391 --> 01:18:32,484
Does she want to go or not?

966
01:18:32,893 --> 01:18:34,292
I want to see that fight...

967
01:18:45,305 --> 01:18:48,206
To G of Heart, for the pig.

968
01:18:48,709 --> 01:18:51,610
The air force found out about the fight.
Stop the silly fight.

969
01:18:52,012 --> 01:18:53,809
Oh, this is must be from Fierrali.

970
01:18:57,117 --> 01:18:58,311
I should hurry.

971
01:19:17,237 --> 01:19:19,637
First of all,
both of them are very tough.

972
01:19:20,340 --> 01:19:22,035
The show isn't over!

973
01:19:24,745 --> 01:19:26,645
Porco, fight!

974
01:19:31,652 --> 01:19:32,846
I'm not going to give Fio to a man

975
01:19:38,659 --> 01:19:40,957
Iike you.

976
01:19:47,568 --> 01:19:48,660
O.K. The pig took Curtis' tail.

977
01:19:49,470 --> 01:19:50,664
It's over!

978
01:20:03,283 --> 01:20:05,080
This is the finish.

979
01:20:07,287 --> 01:20:11,087
Whoops... Jammed, too.

980
01:20:11,992 --> 01:20:14,984
You, idiot! You are out of ammo!

981
01:20:15,896 --> 01:20:18,694
Whoops.
This is broken because of Fio's butt...

982
01:20:21,602 --> 01:20:24,002
I'm not going to finish this fight with a draw.

983
01:20:26,206 --> 01:20:29,300
Ha, ha, ha, ha.
This is not a western. You can't hit me.

984
01:20:31,912 --> 01:20:33,903
You...

985
01:20:35,516 --> 01:20:39,714
You really think it will reach here?

986
01:20:47,528 --> 01:20:48,927
You, stinking pig!

987
01:20:51,832 --> 01:20:53,129
Can't throw it!

988
01:20:54,635 --> 01:20:55,431
Bastard!

989
01:20:55,936 --> 01:20:56,527
Throw it finally!

990
01:20:57,037 --> 01:20:57,935
For love!

991
01:20:58,238 --> 01:20:59,227
Shut up! You piggy!

992
01:21:00,541 --> 01:21:01,633
Looks like something is wrong.

993
01:21:02,743 --> 01:21:03,835
Ah... they are coming.

994
01:21:12,452 --> 01:21:13,350
They are coming back!

995
01:21:13,854 --> 01:21:16,345
Wait! Bids don't leave from here.

996
01:21:17,658 --> 01:21:19,250
O.K. Wait, you guys.

997
01:21:26,466 --> 01:21:27,660
You, fat pig!

998
01:21:29,870 --> 01:21:31,167
You, chicken cowboy!

999
01:21:37,778 --> 01:21:39,268
Come on with your bare hands!

1000
01:21:39,580 --> 01:21:40,774
Go back to cows!

1001
01:21:46,887 --> 01:21:49,685
Porco, hold on!

1002
01:21:51,892 --> 01:21:53,086
Stand up, pig.

1003
01:21:57,598 --> 01:21:59,190
Go, go!

1004
01:22:26,827 --> 01:22:31,924
Bets still stand!

1005
01:22:32,232 --> 01:22:34,928
Where's the betting table?

1006
01:22:38,839 --> 01:22:39,635
Can't you fly faster, much faster?

1007
01:22:40,140 --> 01:22:42,540
It's impossible. Engine would blow.

1008
01:22:43,343 --> 01:22:45,243
Pilots are all stupid, aren't they...

1009
01:22:51,952 --> 01:22:56,150
Hey, Fio. Did you see my punch?

1010
01:22:59,660 --> 01:23:02,151
I'm gonna take him down next round.

1011
01:23:02,863 --> 01:23:05,161
I'll take you down this time.

1012
01:23:05,365 --> 01:23:06,855
Porco, hang on!

1013
01:23:07,567 --> 01:23:10,468
I'll make prosciutto out of you!

1014
01:23:11,772 --> 01:23:12,966
Take aim!

1015
01:23:14,474 --> 01:23:15,873
Come on, you chicken!

1016
01:23:16,576 --> 01:23:17,873
You are the chicken!

1017
01:23:18,478 --> 01:23:20,275
You seduce all women around you.

1018
01:23:20,580 --> 01:23:21,877
That was my word.

1019
01:23:22,382 --> 01:23:24,077
Choose Gina or Fio, either one!

1020
01:23:24,685 --> 01:23:25,879
What?

1021
01:23:29,089 --> 01:23:31,489
Don't choose both.

1022
01:23:33,393 --> 01:23:34,985
Gina is...

1023
01:23:36,997 --> 01:23:40,194
Don't say, Gina, Gina...

1024
01:23:41,201 --> 01:23:45,501
Gina loves you, pig.

1025
01:23:48,809 --> 01:23:50,800
She is...

1026
01:23:51,511 --> 01:23:54,912
waiting for you...

1027
01:23:55,315 --> 01:23:59,809
at the garden!

1028
01:24:07,728 --> 01:24:08,717
Porco!

1029
01:24:09,129 --> 01:24:10,926
The sound of drum.

1030
01:24:12,733 --> 01:24:15,327
It's over! Look at that!

1031
01:24:19,439 --> 01:24:21,737
I can see it.
The ltalian Air Force hasn't arrived, yet.

1032
01:24:33,353 --> 01:24:36,345
You are unfair... You're a dirty liar.

1033
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:43,358
Don't you understand, you idiot.

1034
01:24:43,764 --> 01:24:45,561
I am not telling a lie...

1035
01:24:48,769 --> 01:24:51,260
I don't give Fio to you.

1036
01:24:51,872 --> 01:24:53,567
That's Gina's plane.

1037
01:24:55,776 --> 01:24:57,266
It's an emergency signal.

1038
01:25:09,189 --> 01:25:11,487
1, 2...

1039
01:25:11,691 --> 01:25:13,386
The winner is the one who stand up first.

1040
01:25:14,694 --> 01:25:16,389
Everybody, let me through.

1041
01:25:16,897 --> 01:25:20,890
6, 7, Gina, don't.

1042
01:25:22,402 --> 01:25:23,198
8!

1043
01:25:25,005 --> 01:25:26,905
Marco, Marco, can you hear me?

1044
01:25:30,110 --> 01:25:32,704
Do you want another girl to be unhappy?

1045
01:25:38,218 --> 01:25:39,310
9!

1046
01:25:42,222 --> 01:25:43,314
Porco!

1047
01:25:46,426 --> 01:25:47,518
Porco!

1048
01:25:47,828 --> 01:25:49,318
Porco, thank you!

1049
01:25:50,030 --> 01:25:51,725
Well...

1050
01:25:59,139 --> 01:26:00,436
This party is over.

1051
01:26:00,841 --> 01:26:02,536
The Air Force will be here soon.

1052
01:26:03,443 --> 01:26:04,740
Everybody run away quickly, please.

1053
01:26:05,946 --> 01:26:09,848
Then stop by my restaurant.
I will serve you all.

1054
01:26:12,052 --> 01:26:13,349
Everybody, let's go!

1055
01:26:24,865 --> 01:26:25,763
It's over, Mr.

1056
01:26:29,469 --> 01:26:31,369
Hey, boss, hurry up!

1057
01:26:31,771 --> 01:26:32,465
Shut up!

1058
01:26:32,873 --> 01:26:37,776
I don't like the pig, but I like you.

1059
01:26:38,578 --> 01:26:40,671
Goodbye!

1060
01:26:41,581 --> 01:26:44,277
Thank you.
Take a shower sometimes, will you?

1061
01:26:45,285 --> 01:26:47,879
Thank you, too, Mr. Curtis.

1062
01:26:48,388 --> 01:26:51,084
Next time I'll propose you formally,
not as a bet.

1063
01:26:52,092 --> 01:26:54,686
O.K. But I've made up my mind already.

1064
01:26:55,695 --> 01:26:57,595
You, get on Gina's plane.

1065
01:26:57,998 --> 01:26:58,794
No! No!

1066
01:26:59,699 --> 01:27:02,600
I'm going on Porco's plane.
You said I'm your partner, didn't you.

1067
01:27:04,704 --> 01:27:08,003
Gina. Take her home, please.

1068
01:27:10,410 --> 01:27:12,708
You always do this.

1069
01:27:15,615 --> 01:27:17,913
I'm sorry. Please leave.

1070
01:27:23,623 --> 01:27:24,715
Let's go.

1071
01:27:56,656 --> 01:27:58,647
The ltalian Air Force is finally coming.

1072
01:27:59,259 --> 01:28:02,353
Do you want to help me?
I'm going to lead them astray.

1073
01:28:03,763 --> 01:28:05,856
Wait, the face!

1074
01:28:06,466 --> 01:28:07,558
Let me see your face!

1075
01:28:08,068 --> 01:28:09,365
Your plane is over there, eh?

1076
01:28:09,769 --> 01:28:11,066
Let me see it a little bit!

1077
01:28:19,879 --> 01:28:22,279
After the flight from the Air Force,

1078
01:28:23,483 --> 01:28:25,576
I returned to Milan.

1079
01:28:26,486 --> 01:28:28,579
I haven't seen Porco since.

1080
01:28:30,590 --> 01:28:34,788
Instead, I have found
a very good friend in Miss Gina.

1081
01:28:36,997 --> 01:28:40,592
Since the of the fight,
there have been many wars.

1082
01:28:41,601 --> 01:28:44,195
But I still keep in touch with Gina.

1083
01:28:47,007 --> 01:28:48,304
After I take over the factory 'Piccolo',

1084
01:28:48,708 --> 01:28:53,611
I make it a rule to spend summer vacations
at the Hotel Adriano.

1085
01:28:55,115 --> 01:28:57,606
Miss Gina has become more beautiful since.

1086
01:28:58,218 --> 01:29:00,618
Old friends still stop
by the Hotel all the time.

1087
01:29:02,822 --> 01:29:05,814
Mr. Curtis, now I recall,

1088
01:29:06,326 --> 01:29:08,817
writes to me sometimes
though he is not the president of the U.S., yet.

1089
01:29:09,829 --> 01:29:12,525
He says he longs for the summer
of Adriatic Sea.

1090
01:29:14,834 --> 01:29:16,927
It's only our secret that Gina

1091
01:29:17,537 --> 01:29:20,438
won her gamble...

1092
01:33:10,570 --> 01:33:14,870
End
Thank you for watching
