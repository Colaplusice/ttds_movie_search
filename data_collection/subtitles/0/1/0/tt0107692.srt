1
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:07,599
We lost 300 gold pieces,
thanks to your meddling.

2
00:01:07,637 --> 00:01:10,435
We won't go back empty-handed.

3
00:01:10,473 --> 00:01:13,738
If your hands are so empty,
will you hold this?

4
00:01:41,938 --> 00:01:45,305
Is it true they hired you
for only twenty gold pieces?

5
00:01:45,341 --> 00:01:46,330
Yes.

6
00:01:46,943 --> 00:01:51,277
The sword we stole was a treasure
given to them by the Shogun.

7
00:01:51,314 --> 00:01:55,341
And they'll only pay twenty
pieces to get it back?

8
00:01:57,286 --> 00:01:58,310
Ridiculous!

9
00:01:58,354 --> 00:02:00,652
They're a poor, small clan.

10
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:04,353
Trying to swindle 300 pieces
for a sword is asking too much.

11
00:02:06,262 --> 00:02:08,355
Shut up! Damn you!

12
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,261
Looks like a nasty
storm's brewing...

13
00:02:14,303 --> 00:02:16,100
Can't waste my time here!

14
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:31,376
Oh, I'm sorry for you.

15
00:03:31,414 --> 00:03:33,473
That was one hell of a storm!

16
00:03:33,516 --> 00:03:36,485
No shit! My roof got blown off
and scared my wife so bad...

17
00:03:36,519 --> 00:03:38,214
...that she went into labor.

18
00:03:38,254 --> 00:03:39,949
It was really something.

19
00:03:39,989 --> 00:03:41,718
That's your seventh kid, right?

20
00:03:41,757 --> 00:03:43,349
Nope, the ninth.

21
00:03:43,392 --> 00:03:46,953
Holy...! You must
really love your wife!

22
00:03:48,364 --> 00:03:52,198
Isn't that Sakichi's daughter
from Shimoda Village?

23
00:03:53,402 --> 00:03:55,393
What's with her?

24
00:04:01,410 --> 00:04:03,071
What's wrong?!

25
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,412
All...dead...

26
00:04:11,087 --> 00:04:14,022
Everybody's dead.

27
00:04:14,924 --> 00:04:16,221
Dead?!

28
00:04:16,259 --> 00:04:20,525
Plague... Plague did it...

29
00:04:26,269 --> 00:04:27,998
MY GOD!

30
00:04:28,371 --> 00:04:31,101
This area's off limits!
No one goes through!

31
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:34,735
This highway's closed
until the epidemic is over.

32
00:04:34,777 --> 00:04:36,768
Epidemic?!
The hell with that!

33
00:04:39,782 --> 00:04:41,409
What is it?

34
00:04:41,450 --> 00:04:44,908
Sir, my scout saw a
strange group of men...

35
00:04:44,954 --> 00:04:48,515
...ride toward Shimoda
Village late last night.

36
00:04:48,791 --> 00:04:51,760
It might have something
to do with this epidemic...

37
00:04:51,794 --> 00:04:54,627
...so I came to tell you,
Chamberlain.

38
00:04:54,664 --> 00:04:57,633
Meaning what?
That they spread a plague...

39
00:04:57,667 --> 00:05:00,261
...as they passed
through the village?

40
00:05:00,303 --> 00:05:02,771
Ridiculous!
Why would they do that?

41
00:05:03,739 --> 00:05:05,764
Something's fishy.

42
00:05:05,808 --> 00:05:07,469
Let it alone

43
00:05:11,347 --> 00:05:13,372
On second thought, we can't.

44
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,782
This is the order to all
of you in the Koga ninja team.

45
00:05:15,818 --> 00:05:18,946
Go to Shimoda Village and
find what really happened.

46
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:19,818
Sir!

47
00:05:19,855 --> 00:05:23,291
One more thing. If any of
your people get infected...

48
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:25,787
Understood, sir.

49
00:05:26,529 --> 00:05:29,293
The first group will follow the
Shirakawa River from the north.

50
00:05:29,332 --> 00:05:32,130
The second will cross
Taro Pass from the west.

51
00:05:32,168 --> 00:05:35,296
You'll reach Shimoda Village
in about an hour. Understand?

52
00:05:35,838 --> 00:05:39,797
Hikoza saw them. There were
only eight. No match for us.

53
00:05:41,177 --> 00:05:42,804
Our real enemy is
this epidemic disease.

54
00:05:44,146 --> 00:05:45,511
True.

55
00:05:56,459 --> 00:05:57,448
Kagero...

56
00:06:05,468 --> 00:06:08,198
You intend to leave
me behind, Hanza?

57
00:06:08,838 --> 00:06:11,830
You have your
own duties, don't you?

58
00:06:11,874 --> 00:06:15,241
Poison tasting is very
important. Don't forget that.

59
00:06:15,745 --> 00:06:19,806
While our lord is away from his
domain, the work isn't necessary.

60
00:06:19,849 --> 00:06:23,979
Until he returns...
I am one of the Koga ninja!

61
00:06:25,421 --> 00:06:26,979
I cannot take you.

62
00:06:27,523 --> 00:06:30,014
You all could be
killed out there.

63
00:06:30,059 --> 00:06:31,856
How can I...

64
00:06:31,894 --> 00:06:34,260
...just sit and
wait here alone?!

65
00:06:50,679 --> 00:06:54,877
Kagero's gotten
even more beautiful.

66
00:06:54,917 --> 00:06:57,147
All the more
reason to pity her.

67
00:06:57,186 --> 00:06:59,677
It's her destiny.
She must hate it.

68
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:03,214
Enough. Where are
Hikoza and the others?

69
00:07:03,259 --> 00:07:06,592
They were right behind us.
I'll have a look.

70
00:07:21,477 --> 00:07:23,502
Hey! What are you doing?

71
00:07:28,017 --> 00:07:29,177
What the...?!

72
00:07:56,245 --> 00:07:57,644
There!

73
00:08:19,301 --> 00:08:19,926
Shit!

74
00:08:42,057 --> 00:08:45,993
Kagero, get back and
tell the chamberlain!

75
00:08:48,531 --> 00:08:50,522
Go now!

76
00:10:07,576 --> 00:10:11,410
Just be quiet and you'll
live a little longer.

77
00:10:11,447 --> 00:10:14,974
Either way's fine by me. A dead
girl might be an interesting lay.

78
00:10:18,287 --> 00:10:19,948
That's better.

79
00:10:32,635 --> 00:10:34,728
I'm busy here.
Get lost!

80
00:10:35,671 --> 00:10:37,639
Didn't you hear me?

81
00:10:50,552 --> 00:10:55,546
The highway's out and I had to
make a detour, but now I'm lost.

82
00:10:55,591 --> 00:10:57,559
Can you tell me
how to get to Kakio?

83
00:11:00,996 --> 00:11:02,588
Not very friendly...

84
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:05,327
I think I told
you to get lost!

85
00:11:19,682 --> 00:11:22,150
Forget it. Once I get
rid of this meddler...

86
00:11:22,184 --> 00:11:24,675
...I'll take my
time killing you.

87
00:11:28,023 --> 00:11:33,017
What's wrong? Sorry you
didn't run when I told you to?

88
00:11:34,363 --> 00:11:38,197
No, just thinking...
About your body.

89
00:11:39,968 --> 00:11:43,597
Your body can't be
rock hard everywhere!

90
00:11:49,011 --> 00:11:50,535
Move it!

91
00:12:08,063 --> 00:12:09,394
Tessai!

92
00:12:13,902 --> 00:12:17,235
You are indeed a sorry sight.
But no need to pursue him so.

93
00:12:17,873 --> 00:12:19,363
I'll kill him!

94
00:12:19,408 --> 00:12:22,707
No, you shan't.
Don't forget our mission.

95
00:12:22,745 --> 00:12:26,408
Consider my word
as Lord Gemma's order.

96
00:12:26,715 --> 00:12:28,239
Understood?

97
00:12:28,917 --> 00:12:30,578
Shall we go?

98
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:46,094
Who was that freak?

99
00:12:46,769 --> 00:12:49,260
Forget it. I don't want
to see him again, anyway.

100
00:12:50,472 --> 00:12:54,499
I'm grateful to you.
I am Kagero of the Koga ninja.

101
00:12:56,111 --> 00:13:01,014
Jubei. Kibagami Jubei.
Are you all right?

102
00:13:01,950 --> 00:13:04,111
I don't need your concern!

103
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,783
The town of Kakio is in the west.
Our paths part here.

104
00:13:49,498 --> 00:13:50,863
Who is it?

105
00:13:50,899 --> 00:13:53,800
Kagero of the Koga, sir.

106
00:13:53,836 --> 00:13:55,463
What's wrong?

107
00:13:55,504 --> 00:13:58,962
Twenty ninja led by Hanza
attempted to infiltrate...

108
00:13:59,007 --> 00:14:02,340
...Shimoda Village a little
while ago. They were wiped out.

109
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:06,477
Really? All of them?
Who killed them?

110
00:14:06,515 --> 00:14:10,349
A very formidable opponent.
Beyond that, I cannot say.

111
00:14:11,053 --> 00:14:13,851
Useless, all of them.

112
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:20,522
And you're the only survivor?

113
00:14:21,563 --> 00:14:24,828
Until we learn who he is
and what he's up to...

114
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:28,826
...we can't risk sending our
men to that plague village.

115
00:14:28,871 --> 00:14:32,500
The first task at hand is
to go back and find that out.

116
00:14:32,541 --> 00:14:35,772
We'll figure out what
to do later. Now go...

117
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,912
Oh, hi...

118
00:15:22,224 --> 00:15:24,556
I know the way now, so...

119
00:15:24,593 --> 00:15:28,586
No, you're going the wrong way.
The river to hell...

120
00:15:30,165 --> 00:15:32,133
...is THlS way!

121
00:15:44,012 --> 00:15:49,473
Ow... Okay, it's out of your
system. Are we even now?

122
00:15:50,619 --> 00:15:53,611
Not yet. I still owe you.

123
00:15:55,190 --> 00:15:56,919
That's just excessive.

124
00:15:56,959 --> 00:16:00,986
If we keep this up,
one of us is going to die.

125
00:16:01,897 --> 00:16:03,990
"One of us?"

126
00:16:04,633 --> 00:16:08,000
There's no reason we
should kill each other.

127
00:16:12,307 --> 00:16:15,003
If you're not going
to end this...I will!

128
00:16:16,244 --> 00:16:17,336
Like hell!

129
00:16:27,255 --> 00:16:31,453
Strange skill you have.
But it can't hurt my body.

130
00:16:33,261 --> 00:16:34,660
Seems that way.

131
00:16:48,510 --> 00:16:52,446
What's wrong, monster?
Your skin's starting to crumble!

132
00:16:55,684 --> 00:16:57,675
Die!

133
00:17:32,387 --> 00:17:35,845
Splendid! Your sword flew
swift as the wind itself...

134
00:17:35,891 --> 00:17:41,386
...and slashed your enemy
like a cyclone's touch.

135
00:17:42,697 --> 00:17:46,360
He was no match for you.
Why don't you join me?

136
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:51,703
Your skills will be of great help
for me to fight the likes of him.

137
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:56,404
You're joking. Who'd want to
fight a monster like him again?

138
00:17:57,412 --> 00:18:00,347
You'll have to.
They won't leave you alone.

139
00:18:00,382 --> 00:18:04,409
You've just killed one
of the Eight Devils of Kimon.

140
00:18:06,054 --> 00:18:10,423
You didn't beat
him by yourself, though.

141
00:18:11,426 --> 00:18:16,090
That Koga ninja woman...
lnteresting technique she uses.

142
00:18:32,414 --> 00:18:36,441
Lord Gemma. Everything
is proceeding as planned.

143
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:46,454
It arrives from the Shogun of
the Dark by six tomorrow evening.

144
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:53,090
Very well.
Write to him in return.

145
00:18:53,135 --> 00:18:58,471
"We return in three days.
There's nothing to worry about."

146
00:18:59,141 --> 00:19:00,802
At once.

147
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:07,615
lsn't Tessai back yet?

148
00:19:07,649 --> 00:19:13,019
Benisato went to look for him.
We're all alone.

149
00:19:13,822 --> 00:19:17,815
Yurimaru...
I've always loved you.

150
00:19:27,102 --> 00:19:29,764
Don't push your luck, Zakuro.

151
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:33,171
You're of no interest to me.
Now go and stand watch.

152
00:19:44,486 --> 00:19:46,511
So, it's true.

153
00:19:47,022 --> 00:19:50,082
May your dreams be pleasant
ones in Gemma's arms.

154
00:19:50,125 --> 00:19:54,824
However, Yurimaru, Gemma makes
love to both men and women.

155
00:19:54,863 --> 00:19:57,855
Do you know he makes
love to Benisato?

156
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,529
Apparently not.

157
00:20:49,618 --> 00:20:52,917
Where are you headed?

158
00:20:54,256 --> 00:20:57,157
No place in particular. You?

159
00:20:57,559 --> 00:21:03,930
I'm looking for somebody, and
you look exactly like him, so...

160
00:21:04,466 --> 00:21:08,664
Strangers can look alike.
I'm Kibagami Jubei, a wanderer...

161
00:21:20,949 --> 00:21:23,247
It was most
certainly your face.

162
00:21:23,285 --> 00:21:27,278
Tessai was able to make
an impression of it.

163
00:21:43,605 --> 00:21:45,630
Just leave me the hell alone!

164
00:21:54,316 --> 00:21:56,443
A cast-off skin.

165
00:21:56,484 --> 00:21:59,976
She shed it like
a snake and escaped.

166
00:22:01,956 --> 00:22:04,857
A gang of freaks,
one and all.

167
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:10,863
You've no obligation. I just
didn't want you to die yet.

168
00:22:12,233 --> 00:22:14,861
Who are these
Eight Devils of Kimon?

169
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:17,801
A group of ninja who
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

170
00:22:17,839 --> 00:22:20,307
You know of the
Shogun of the Dark?

171
00:22:20,342 --> 00:22:23,311
He wants to rebuild the House of
Toyotomi, the ex-ruler of Japan.

172
00:22:23,345 --> 00:22:26,974
He has 16 lords behind him and
is trying to expand his influence.

173
00:22:27,015 --> 00:22:30,542
The most dangerous enemy
of the Tokugawa Shogunate.

174
00:22:30,585 --> 00:22:34,646
His power is supported in the
shadows by the Eight Devils.

175
00:22:34,689 --> 00:22:37,681
What are they up to
here in Mochizuki?

176
00:22:38,526 --> 00:22:42,360
That's what I came here to
find out. It's a tough job.

177
00:22:43,031 --> 00:22:46,398
Why don't you work for me,
for 100 gold pieces?

178
00:22:47,535 --> 00:22:50,629
A Tokugawa spy wants
to hire a ninja?

179
00:22:52,207 --> 00:22:54,607
I'm afraid I have no choice.
It's an emergency.

180
00:22:54,642 --> 00:22:58,043
Only I managed to make
it here to Mochizuki.

181
00:22:58,079 --> 00:23:00,843
The Eight Devils killed everyone
else in my party on our way here.

182
00:23:00,882 --> 00:23:03,646
I need your
help by all means!

183
00:23:04,386 --> 00:23:07,355
You'll never get away from them.

184
00:23:07,389 --> 00:23:09,653
You'll have to fight
them sooner or later.

185
00:23:09,691 --> 00:23:13,058
Join me. You can kill two
birds with one stone, right?

186
00:23:13,695 --> 00:23:17,654
I don't think so. Now why
don't you just leave me alone?

187
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:23,332
I see. Too bad.

188
00:23:23,371 --> 00:23:25,339
Such a pity...

189
00:23:27,709 --> 00:23:32,408
You'll lose
your precious life.

190
00:23:32,747 --> 00:23:34,237
You're stubborn.

191
00:23:34,282 --> 00:23:38,082
No, what I speak of is literally
of life or death importance to you.

192
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:42,556
You see, the point of that
throwing star was poisoned.

193
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:45,559
It won't kill you instantly,
but in a day and a night...

194
00:23:45,593 --> 00:23:48,585
...when it starts to work,
nothing can stop it.

195
00:23:49,397 --> 00:23:53,731
Unless you get the antidote.
And only I know what it is.

196
00:23:53,768 --> 00:23:56,760
Work for me and I'll tell you
the antidote along with the...

197
00:23:56,805 --> 00:23:59,467
...hundred gold pieces
when the job is done.

198
00:24:00,308 --> 00:24:02,435
You're bluffing.

199
00:24:07,749 --> 00:24:09,341
I speak the truth.

200
00:24:09,384 --> 00:24:13,081
Tell me now.
What's the antidote?

201
00:24:13,121 --> 00:24:17,785
Not until you work for me.
Kill me and you've killed yourself!

202
00:24:23,131 --> 00:24:25,725
Now you'll need the
antidote for yourself.

203
00:24:25,767 --> 00:24:28,736
Poor boy...
You've so much to learn.

204
00:24:28,770 --> 00:24:31,466
That isn't the
one that hit you.

205
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:34,973
I threw THAT one away.

206
00:24:38,146 --> 00:24:39,807
Shit!

207
00:24:40,181 --> 00:24:44,515
Kibagami Jubei...
You've lost...amateur!

208
00:24:45,753 --> 00:24:49,484
My name is Dakuan.
How do you do?

209
00:24:54,162 --> 00:24:55,129
So, Benisato...

210
00:24:55,163 --> 00:24:59,429
This man, Kibagami Jubei, is a
remnant of the Shogunate's spies?

211
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:01,300
Possibly.

212
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:03,634
Why didn't you kill him?

213
00:25:03,671 --> 00:25:05,138
Someone interfered.

214
00:25:05,173 --> 00:25:07,164
No excuses!

215
00:25:09,511 --> 00:25:13,971
If he's a government spy,
he'll show up here soon.

216
00:25:14,015 --> 00:25:16,142
Be sure to kill him this time!

217
00:25:16,317 --> 00:25:18,979
I don't need your
advice to do that.

218
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:24,981
Yurimaru... I'll tell Gemma
about this in bed. Do you mind?

219
00:25:26,995 --> 00:25:28,326
Not at all.

220
00:25:33,868 --> 00:25:35,631
Jubei...

221
00:25:35,670 --> 00:25:39,766
There's something
I've been wondering.

222
00:25:40,341 --> 00:25:43,276
Are you, by any chance,
the ninja who killed...

223
00:25:43,311 --> 00:25:46,280
...the chief retainers of the
Yamashiro clan five years ago?

224
00:25:47,382 --> 00:25:50,818
He was supposedly a
master swordsman, like you.

225
00:25:53,988 --> 00:25:56,957
The retainers who were killed
had gorged themselves with gold...

226
00:25:56,991 --> 00:26:00,324
...they secretly dug
out of a hidden mine.

227
00:26:00,361 --> 00:26:03,296
The ninja must have killed
them by order of the lord...

228
00:26:03,331 --> 00:26:06,357
...who wanted to report to
the government about the mine.

229
00:26:06,401 --> 00:26:09,302
Because if the government found
the hidden gold mine first...

230
00:26:09,337 --> 00:26:11,362
...the lord would have
lost his fief.

231
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:15,498
But does that ninja know that
after the retainers were killed...

232
00:26:15,543 --> 00:26:19,070
...the government received
no report about the mine?

233
00:26:20,048 --> 00:26:24,348
Why? If a government spy
like you knows all that...

234
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:27,081
...then why don't
you do something?

235
00:26:27,722 --> 00:26:32,352
No... Even the government can't
move without definite evidence.

236
00:26:32,393 --> 00:26:36,659
Our spies tried many times
to infiltrate the clan...

237
00:26:36,698 --> 00:26:39,326
...to find evidence,
but none returned alive.

238
00:26:39,367 --> 00:26:41,232
The Shogun of the Dark...

239
00:26:41,269 --> 00:26:44,102
He stopped them by
using the Kimon ninja.

240
00:26:44,706 --> 00:26:48,142
Why is the Shogun of the Dark
helping the Yamashiro clan?

241
00:26:48,676 --> 00:26:52,407
Simple. He wants the
gold mine for himself.

242
00:26:53,748 --> 00:26:59,380
Do you know how he found the
gold mine before the government?

243
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:01,980
Because somebody
gave him the information.

244
00:27:02,023 --> 00:27:05,652
Somebody who was the leader of
the ninja of the Yamashiro clan.

245
00:27:06,794 --> 00:27:08,352
Himuro...Gemma?!

246
00:27:10,098 --> 00:27:11,360
Precisely.

247
00:27:12,767 --> 00:27:16,362
I doubt that. He isn't
in this world anymore.

248
00:27:16,771 --> 00:27:20,229
No, he's still very much alive.
And you'll see him soon.

249
00:27:20,274 --> 00:27:23,732
Himuro Gemma is the boss
of the Kimon monsters.

250
00:27:23,778 --> 00:27:24,745
What?!

251
00:27:24,779 --> 00:27:26,713
Shh! Not so loud!

252
00:27:26,748 --> 00:27:28,579
You can't trick me
the same way again!

253
00:27:28,616 --> 00:27:32,382
Don't be hasty.
You'll soon know the truth.

254
00:27:33,054 --> 00:27:38,117
But you must admit that you
and he share a strange fate.

255
00:27:44,065 --> 00:27:46,932
Stop! You'd kill
your own friend?!

256
00:27:46,968 --> 00:27:50,460
- The lord orders it!
- As did our leader!

257
00:27:51,873 --> 00:27:54,842
It's a trick! Now that we
know the traitors' secret...

258
00:27:54,876 --> 00:27:58,437
...they want to get rid of us
by making us kill each other.

259
00:27:58,813 --> 00:28:02,806
This is a trap for all of us.
Shinkuro, believe me!

260
00:28:03,518 --> 00:28:05,452
Jubei... Forgive me.

261
00:28:05,820 --> 00:28:06,946
Shinkuro!

262
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:09,786
His word...

263
00:28:09,824 --> 00:28:11,655
...is law!

264
00:28:50,031 --> 00:28:55,196
I avenged Shinkuro and others
myself. Gemma can't be alive.

265
00:28:56,471 --> 00:29:00,805
We're getting close. This place
is thick with ghosts and blood.

266
00:29:00,842 --> 00:29:03,208
Beyond lies hell itself.

267
00:29:07,548 --> 00:29:11,541
Heaven must have sent
this mist to help us.

268
00:29:26,734 --> 00:29:28,065
Hey!

269
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:37,738
Double damned mist!

270
00:30:01,769 --> 00:30:05,603
How could he have
dodged Shijima's claw?

271
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,899
Who are you?

272
00:30:35,937 --> 00:30:38,269
I heard a voice
chanting the sutra.

273
00:30:38,306 --> 00:30:41,707
I was praying for
the dead villagers.

274
00:30:42,643 --> 00:30:46,306
Don't you know an epidemic
is plaguing this village?

275
00:30:47,982 --> 00:30:52,646
Poor soul! You'll never
leave this village alive.

276
00:30:53,154 --> 00:30:56,646
Here now, let us go to
the land of Buddha together.

277
00:31:02,730 --> 00:31:06,666
Have you seen a
traveling monk here?

278
00:31:07,268 --> 00:31:12,467
He'll meet Buddha soon enough.
I'll send him there.

279
00:31:13,174 --> 00:31:14,971
Such a benevolent nun...

280
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:25,444
Shit!
Another cast-off skin!

281
00:31:35,696 --> 00:31:39,689
Gone... He uses
a strange technique...

282
00:31:50,378 --> 00:31:52,642
As do you.
Very strange indeed!

283
00:32:01,889 --> 00:32:08,658
Answer me. Are there any
others with you besides the monk?

284
00:32:09,730 --> 00:32:13,029
Of course.
And not just ten or twenty.

285
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:16,161
You can send a snake for each
and it won't be enough.

286
00:32:17,738 --> 00:32:19,706
Liar!

287
00:32:19,740 --> 00:32:23,403
All right!
I'll tell you the truth.

288
00:32:23,444 --> 00:32:27,346
There's two. One's the
traveling monk. The other...

289
00:32:27,381 --> 00:32:29,372
...is right behind you.

290
00:32:31,252 --> 00:32:33,743
Lose the snakes.
Down to the last one!

291
00:32:40,127 --> 00:32:42,095
You'll be dead soon.

292
00:32:46,067 --> 00:32:47,762
Get rid of them!

293
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:07,751
Now it's your turn to answer.

294
00:33:07,788 --> 00:33:10,723
What are you doing
in this village? Talk!

295
00:33:32,480 --> 00:33:35,415
Twice failed. Unforgivable.

296
00:33:35,449 --> 00:33:39,476
I cast another line onto your
neck, but you didn't notice.

297
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:42,819
In the end,
just a foolish amateur.

298
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:03,838
ldiot! There's still time
to suck the poison out!

299
00:34:04,478 --> 00:34:07,447
Poison doesn't work on me.
My body's immune to it.

300
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:12,744
I think I've cleared
my debt to you.

301
00:34:12,787 --> 00:34:15,654
Yes. You saved me.

302
00:34:15,689 --> 00:34:19,819
Your name's Kagero, right?
What are you going to do now?

303
00:34:19,860 --> 00:34:22,454
That's none of your concern.

304
00:34:23,164 --> 00:34:25,189
If it isn't, then what
the hell am I doing here?!

305
00:34:26,534 --> 00:34:29,833
I have to discover
their plan.

306
00:34:29,870 --> 00:34:32,168
By yourself? lmpossible!

307
00:34:32,206 --> 00:34:34,834
They're too strong.
Think this over.

308
00:34:34,875 --> 00:34:36,467
Stay out of my way.

309
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,877
I've no reason to
take orders from you.

310
00:34:43,384 --> 00:34:45,545
Hold a moment,
ninja woman of Koga.

311
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:50,819
My name is Dakuan.
Why don't you join me?

312
00:34:50,858 --> 00:34:54,555
This man is my
trustworthy assistant.

313
00:34:54,929 --> 00:34:57,489
I wasn't planning on
helping a government spy.

314
00:34:57,531 --> 00:34:59,556
Oh, quit complaining!

315
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:01,192
What do you say, woman?

316
00:35:01,235 --> 00:35:05,672
Our aims may differ, but we
three share a common enemy.

317
00:35:05,706 --> 00:35:08,698
And three is mightier than one.

318
00:35:08,742 --> 00:35:11,711
And I happen to have some
information you don't know.

319
00:35:11,745 --> 00:35:15,181
Such as who is giving
them their orders.

320
00:35:15,216 --> 00:35:17,207
I'll tell you on the way.

321
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:22,883
I need no friends.

322
00:35:22,923 --> 00:35:26,882
But I may need
your information.

323
00:35:26,927 --> 00:35:28,588
Very well.

324
00:35:34,635 --> 00:35:39,265
My, she's a lovely, sexy
little thing, isn't she!

325
00:35:39,673 --> 00:35:42,369
What's running through
that twisted skull of yours?

326
00:35:42,977 --> 00:35:46,845
Well now, that ninja girl
could prove very useful.

327
00:35:46,881 --> 00:35:51,181
She has a technique to poison
the man she sleeps with.

328
00:35:51,218 --> 00:35:55,882
The big guy you killed
had been poisoned by her.

329
00:36:01,595 --> 00:36:04,621
Anyone who makes
love to her dies.

330
00:36:04,665 --> 00:36:09,364
A perfect woman for
this hellish world.

331
00:36:51,045 --> 00:36:53,843
Your skill is as
marvelous as ever.

332
00:36:53,881 --> 00:36:57,044
No... He was able to kill
a mighty ninja like Tessai.

333
00:36:57,084 --> 00:37:01,919
Don't be off guard.
It's possible he got away.

334
00:37:01,956 --> 00:37:03,981
The four of you
will check it out.

335
00:37:04,024 --> 00:37:06,424
You're a cautious one,
Yurimaru.

336
00:37:06,460 --> 00:37:11,693
We have an important mission.
We take every precaution.

337
00:37:11,732 --> 00:37:14,030
I know, I know. Don't worry.

338
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:15,695
Then go.

339
00:37:18,439 --> 00:37:23,035
Yurimaru, Benisato's death...
How fortunate for you!

340
00:37:32,353 --> 00:37:34,651
Only things he
killed were the fish.

341
00:37:34,688 --> 00:37:37,020
Good. Otherwise we
wouldn't get our chance.

342
00:37:37,057 --> 00:37:39,389
It's getting quite
interesting, isn't it?

343
00:37:54,108 --> 00:37:57,475
How is it?
Just as we thought?

344
00:37:58,245 --> 00:38:01,373
They poisoned the wells
and killed the villagers.

345
00:38:01,415 --> 00:38:04,009
And then blamed it
on an epidemic disease.

346
00:38:04,051 --> 00:38:07,145
A trick to keep
the villagers away.

347
00:38:08,022 --> 00:38:12,755
They're planning something...
very extraordinary.

348
00:38:23,704 --> 00:38:26,400
I'd like to
know what it is.

349
00:38:26,740 --> 00:38:29,766
That's fine, just don't get
yourself involved too deeply.

350
00:38:29,810 --> 00:38:31,778
It could prove fatal.

351
00:38:53,100 --> 00:38:55,125
I see. Guide the others.

352
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:14,486
Run for it!

353
00:39:36,510 --> 00:39:38,501
We can't outrun them.

354
00:39:40,814 --> 00:39:41,838
Kagero...

355
00:39:59,867 --> 00:40:02,495
So, the pollen is mixed
with a sleeping potion.

356
00:40:02,536 --> 00:40:04,504
But how long will
it hold them back?

357
00:40:05,539 --> 00:40:06,870
Why, you...!

358
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:08,808
Girl!

359
00:40:08,842 --> 00:40:11,174
You have to hold them off
till Jubei kills him!

360
00:40:11,211 --> 00:40:13,202
Do whatever it takes!

361
00:40:27,528 --> 00:40:30,156
Call off your wasps!

362
00:40:30,197 --> 00:40:32,893
I'm afraid you
must beat me first.

363
00:40:34,902 --> 00:40:36,893
You don't know
anything, do you?

364
00:40:36,937 --> 00:40:39,906
Do you think I ran
in here to escape you?

365
00:40:40,574 --> 00:40:41,541
No, I don't.

366
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:44,544
I have lots of questions for
you, but no time to ask them.

367
00:40:44,578 --> 00:40:48,537
No, just one thing.
Tell me, is Himuro Gemma alive?

368
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,209
So what if he is?

369
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:52,878
Because I sent
him to hell before.

370
00:40:52,920 --> 00:40:55,718
Is that so?
Then I'll have to be careful.

371
00:40:55,756 --> 00:41:00,159
Unlike Gemma, I don't have the
technique to reincarnate myself.

372
00:41:00,561 --> 00:41:02,188
Reincarnation?

373
00:41:10,604 --> 00:41:12,936
Fool! You've
damaged the hive!

374
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:32,623
The second you come up for air
is the second you die!

375
00:41:35,329 --> 00:41:38,890
He's mine!
Keep your hands off him!

376
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:40,593
What about the ninja
girl and the monk?

377
00:41:40,634 --> 00:41:44,730
My wasps should
finish them off soon.

378
00:41:53,947 --> 00:41:57,747
How far is he trying to run?
What a poor loser!

379
00:42:12,633 --> 00:42:15,500
Do you think he's fallen
victim to the throat needle?

380
00:42:25,979 --> 00:42:30,643
No... The wasps in the hive
are trying to escape the water.

381
00:42:30,684 --> 00:42:34,984
Desperately stinging his body
as they do so... Mushizo's lost.

382
00:42:46,700 --> 00:42:49,168
Took his time about it,
but he finally killed him.

383
00:43:03,684 --> 00:43:09,384
Reincarnation? Did he mean
Himuro Gemma's come back to life?

384
00:43:10,390 --> 00:43:12,051
lmpossible!

385
00:43:24,905 --> 00:43:28,898
Reincarnation?
I've heard about the technique.

386
00:43:29,943 --> 00:43:35,210
You must control your flesh and
blood down to the tiniest bones.

387
00:43:35,248 --> 00:43:38,240
If your limbs or even
your head were cut off...

388
00:43:38,285 --> 00:43:41,379
...you'd be able to rejoin them.

389
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:44,549
Reincarnation...
That's a technique of immortality.

390
00:43:44,591 --> 00:43:47,185
It can never be achieved
by a human being.

391
00:43:47,227 --> 00:43:49,855
Well, well...
That's a hell of a trick!

392
00:43:49,896 --> 00:43:54,230
Anyway, the Kimon monsters
are now all after you.

393
00:43:54,267 --> 00:43:56,929
That means I can move easily.

394
00:43:59,606 --> 00:44:02,268
If you're lucky,
we'll meet again.

395
00:44:04,945 --> 00:44:07,277
Why did you join him?

396
00:44:07,881 --> 00:44:11,180
He hired me...
For 100 gold pieces.

397
00:44:11,218 --> 00:44:13,914
You're a mercenary ninja?
One who'd do anything for money?

398
00:44:15,022 --> 00:44:16,853
You could say that.

399
00:44:16,890 --> 00:44:20,951
But he suckered me
into it. Trapped me.

400
00:44:21,595 --> 00:44:24,189
I'll die of his poison
in half a day.

401
00:44:25,599 --> 00:44:29,433
He promised me an antidote
along with the gold.

402
00:44:29,469 --> 00:44:33,929
That's why I work for him.
I can't back out now.

403
00:44:33,974 --> 00:44:37,603
You'd better run for it
while I divert their attention.

404
00:44:37,644 --> 00:44:40,670
I can't do that.
I'd owe you another debt.

405
00:44:41,281 --> 00:44:42,908
Forget about any debts.

406
00:44:42,949 --> 00:44:46,248
And I told you I don't
have to take orders from you.

407
00:44:46,286 --> 00:44:48,652
Besides, I'm ready
to die any moment.

408
00:44:48,689 --> 00:44:50,680
Relax. Stop pretending
you're so tough.

409
00:44:50,957 --> 00:44:52,322
What?!

410
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:55,892
It's this humid weather!

411
00:44:55,929 --> 00:44:59,990
I wish a storm would come and
cool off that hot head of yours.

412
00:45:04,504 --> 00:45:06,995
You're in no position
to worry about me.

413
00:45:13,013 --> 00:45:14,674
Storm...

414
00:45:16,183 --> 00:45:21,018
They came on the night
of that big storm...

415
00:45:25,192 --> 00:45:27,888
Hey, where can I get a
good look at this area?

416
00:45:34,634 --> 00:45:35,965
How about there?

417
00:45:36,002 --> 00:45:37,663
Nothing.

418
00:45:37,704 --> 00:45:39,365
Keep looking!

419
00:45:51,718 --> 00:45:52,980
Hanza...

420
00:45:53,019 --> 00:45:54,043
Wait!

421
00:45:54,654 --> 00:45:55,882
Hanza!

422
00:46:00,393 --> 00:46:03,385
There's a cliff
in front of you! Stop!

423
00:46:03,997 --> 00:46:05,396
Damn...!

424
00:46:19,079 --> 00:46:20,068
Gotcha!

425
00:46:20,113 --> 00:46:21,410
Shit!

426
00:46:29,122 --> 00:46:33,752
Fool! They got you so soon?
We still had a lot to do.

427
00:46:38,732 --> 00:46:41,701
The scent of blasted flesh,
grilled to perfection...

428
00:46:41,735 --> 00:46:44,101
Such a lovely smell.

429
00:47:08,428 --> 00:47:10,020
Don't...move...

430
00:47:10,063 --> 00:47:12,122
That's enough. Let me go.

431
00:47:12,165 --> 00:47:14,633
It's my fault I
fell for their trap.

432
00:47:14,668 --> 00:47:17,136
Shut up! Don't talk!

433
00:47:17,170 --> 00:47:20,139
Let go of me!
I don't want your help.

434
00:47:20,173 --> 00:47:21,606
Shut up...!!!

435
00:47:30,116 --> 00:47:32,482
Go on, grab it!

436
00:47:44,831 --> 00:47:47,823
Just gonna hang
onto me all day?

437
00:48:04,885 --> 00:48:09,185
I am Utsutsu Mujuro.
I've been longing to challenge you.

438
00:48:16,162 --> 00:48:18,426
He's here for me.
Stay here.

439
00:48:31,378 --> 00:48:35,872
You lured me here because I'm blind?
Is that your plan?

440
00:48:50,196 --> 00:48:52,790
If you want to kill me,
then don't make a sound.

441
00:48:53,900 --> 00:48:57,802
That's impossible. But maybe I can
turn your skill to my advantage.

442
00:49:36,810 --> 00:49:38,869
I told you to stay back!

443
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:47,276
Your sight is your weakness.

444
00:49:51,224 --> 00:49:52,623
Outta the way!

445
00:50:04,337 --> 00:50:05,565
lmpossible...

446
00:50:28,895 --> 00:50:32,331
Would you give it a rest?!
What the hell were you thinking?!

447
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:35,631
What are you
so obsessed about?

448
00:50:35,668 --> 00:50:39,934
Shut up! You're the one obsessed
with repaying me for saving you!

449
00:50:39,973 --> 00:50:42,999
You act like you've got
some kind of death wish!

450
00:50:44,010 --> 00:50:45,671
Is it because of your body?

451
00:50:49,516 --> 00:50:53,680
Is it true the men you sleep
with die from the poison?

452
00:50:59,059 --> 00:51:00,959
Embrace me
and you'll find out.

453
00:51:06,866 --> 00:51:08,333
ldiot!

454
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:10,996
My body is saturated with poison.

455
00:51:11,037 --> 00:51:15,030
It's so strong that a touch of
my lips will kill instantly.

456
00:51:16,042 --> 00:51:21,378
No one can touch me.
Anyone who dares to...dies.

457
00:51:22,015 --> 00:51:24,381
Did the poison twist
your heart, too?

458
00:51:24,751 --> 00:51:26,480
How dare you!

459
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:35,489
I hate people who don't
value their own lives.

460
00:51:54,481 --> 00:51:58,076
You've no idea...
You couldn't understand!

461
00:52:38,825 --> 00:52:42,022
The cargo from the ship that ran
aground in the storm two days ago.

462
00:52:42,061 --> 00:52:44,120
That's what they're after.

463
00:52:44,164 --> 00:52:47,463
They butchered the villagers
like animals for it.

464
00:53:01,147 --> 00:53:03,513
Where does this road lead?

465
00:53:09,556 --> 00:53:10,420
Chamberlain!

466
00:53:11,791 --> 00:53:14,385
Lord Hyobu, is it true?
That the Koga ninja who...

467
00:53:14,427 --> 00:53:18,454
...went to investigate Shimoda
Village were wiped out?

468
00:53:18,498 --> 00:53:19,965
Exactly.

469
00:53:19,999 --> 00:53:23,765
But how...?!
This is an emergency.

470
00:53:23,803 --> 00:53:26,101
I'll take my men to the
village immediately.

471
00:53:26,139 --> 00:53:27,163
No!

472
00:53:27,207 --> 00:53:31,803
If this is serious
enough to jeopardize...

473
00:53:31,844 --> 00:53:34,779
...the safety of our clan,
we must move very carefully.

474
00:53:34,814 --> 00:53:37,408
That's how small clans
like ours can survive.

475
00:53:37,450 --> 00:53:38,474
But...

476
00:53:38,518 --> 00:53:42,181
The ninja woman who survived
is continuing the investigation.

477
00:53:42,222 --> 00:53:44,190
Wait for her report.

478
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:00,503
You're tired from being
tensed up all the time.

479
00:54:00,540 --> 00:54:02,201
Get some more sleep.

480
00:54:54,027 --> 00:54:57,724
Those wheel tracks lead
to Kashima Harbor.

481
00:54:57,764 --> 00:55:00,562
They're probably going to
transport the cargo out by boat.

482
00:55:00,600 --> 00:55:02,067
If I don't stop them...

483
00:55:02,101 --> 00:55:05,127
...the dead villagers and Koga
ninja will never rest in peace.

484
00:55:07,640 --> 00:55:10,905
I'll cooperate with you
till the mission's over.

485
00:55:10,943 --> 00:55:15,073
But if you insult me again,
I'll kill you where you stand!

486
00:55:30,263 --> 00:55:34,256
Listen well, you who labor
for the Shogun of the Dark.

487
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:38,236
This mission could very
well decide our fate!

488
00:55:38,271 --> 00:55:41,263
This ship will reach the
Mochizuki domain in a few hours.

489
00:55:41,307 --> 00:55:44,765
We must retrieve the
cargo at any cost!

490
00:55:44,811 --> 00:55:47,302
Understood? At any cost!

491
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,662
The townsmen must have cleared out
out fear of the epidemic.

492
00:56:10,269 --> 00:56:13,500
One horse was enough
to scare them all away.

493
00:56:18,010 --> 00:56:21,969
So, you're still alive.
I've been worried.

494
00:56:22,014 --> 00:56:24,039
It's nice to see you, too.

495
00:56:24,317 --> 00:56:27,844
They're waiting for a boat
to transport the cargo.

496
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:30,279
Did you check
what the cargo is?

497
00:56:30,323 --> 00:56:34,987
No, I couldn't reach it.
But I can guess what it is.

498
00:56:35,027 --> 00:56:37,655
Actually, I guessed before
I came here to Mochizuki.

499
00:56:37,697 --> 00:56:38,664
What?!

500
00:56:38,698 --> 00:56:40,996
You haven't figured it out?

501
00:56:41,033 --> 00:56:43,558
It's something that has
to do with your past.

502
00:56:44,337 --> 00:56:50,071
It's gold, boy. Gold produced
from that secret Yamashiro mine.

503
00:56:51,878 --> 00:56:54,005
The ship ran aground
during the storm...

504
00:56:54,046 --> 00:56:58,346
Probably on its way to the Shogun
of the Dark with caskets of gold.

505
00:56:58,384 --> 00:57:02,946
Gold that's probably been
hidden for the last five years.

506
00:57:02,989 --> 00:57:05,287
If it reaches his hands,
he'll be powerful enough...

507
00:57:05,324 --> 00:57:07,952
...to topple the
Tokugawa government...

508
00:57:07,994 --> 00:57:10,189
...and plunge the country
into another civil war.

509
00:57:10,229 --> 00:57:12,561
We have to stop it at any cost!

510
00:57:16,736 --> 00:57:19,398
Dakuan, you've got a tail.

511
00:57:19,439 --> 00:57:20,599
What?!

512
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:32,741
Girl, what are you doing?!

513
00:57:32,785 --> 00:57:36,778
I'm calling a Koga ninja bird
that's in this village.

514
00:57:36,823 --> 00:57:38,814
Calling a bird? What for?

515
00:57:38,858 --> 00:57:41,725
It'll carry my message
to the castle chamberlain.

516
00:57:41,761 --> 00:57:43,729
I've discovered
what they're after.

517
00:57:43,763 --> 00:57:47,756
In two hours, his army
will surround the town.

518
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:49,768
It's not as easy as you think.

519
00:57:49,802 --> 00:57:52,930
The Mochizuki clan will probably
ignore this whole thing.

520
00:57:53,406 --> 00:57:54,270
Why?!

521
00:57:58,744 --> 00:58:00,439
The future of
the clan is at stake.

522
00:58:00,480 --> 00:58:03,745
This is a power struggle between the
Tokugawa and the Shogun of the Dark.

523
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:07,617
If a small clan like the Mochizuki
got involved, it'd be smashed!

524
00:58:10,823 --> 00:58:14,452
See nothing, hear nothing.
That's the best course for the clan.

525
00:58:26,305 --> 00:58:28,967
We'll find out soon whether or
not the Mochizuki will move.

526
00:58:38,818 --> 00:58:41,116
So, now what are
you playing at?

527
00:58:41,153 --> 00:58:45,453
The man you hired is going
to die from your poison.

528
00:58:45,491 --> 00:58:47,721
Tell me how to save him.

529
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:52,823
Amazing! You've fallen in
love with Jubei, haven't you?

530
00:58:54,333 --> 00:58:57,825
Fool! I'm only doing it
to clear my debt with him!

531
00:58:58,538 --> 00:59:00,529
I don't think so.

532
00:59:01,207 --> 00:59:04,665
A ninja woman falling in love!
What's the point?

533
00:59:07,446 --> 00:59:10,347
If you kill me,
there'll be no saving him.

534
00:59:10,383 --> 00:59:14,513
Yes, and your mission
will be a failure.

535
00:59:30,202 --> 00:59:31,533
Shit!

536
00:59:32,138 --> 00:59:33,537
Uh-oh!

537
00:59:34,106 --> 00:59:38,099
Calm down!
That's the real cure for him.

538
00:59:38,144 --> 00:59:40,874
If you want to save his life,
there's no other way.

539
00:59:40,913 --> 00:59:43,211
It's up to you.

540
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:15,576
It must have happened when
I went off for a moment.

541
01:00:17,416 --> 01:00:20,579
She's most likely dead.

542
01:00:21,253 --> 01:00:24,245
Well, we've got work to do.

543
01:00:24,290 --> 01:00:26,884
We'll get no help
from the Mochizuki clan.

544
01:00:30,529 --> 01:00:33,089
Don't fall for their trap.

545
01:00:33,432 --> 01:00:34,899
Wait!

546
01:00:35,434 --> 01:00:37,902
What if their ship comes
while you're at it?

547
01:00:37,937 --> 01:00:41,395
Let her alone! A dead ninja
girl isn't that important!

548
01:00:42,274 --> 01:00:44,242
Not important compared
to the great mission?

549
01:00:44,276 --> 01:00:46,244
You're as much of
a monster as they are!

550
01:00:46,278 --> 01:00:48,246
Fool! When you fight monsters...

551
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:51,272
...you become one yourself
or you can't win.

552
01:00:52,284 --> 01:00:57,221
You damn fool boy!
Go ahead! GO TO HELL!

553
01:00:57,256 --> 01:01:00,282
You god damned...!!!

554
01:02:02,021 --> 01:02:03,682
Are you all right?

555
01:02:05,324 --> 01:02:06,689
Kagero!

556
01:02:25,211 --> 01:02:29,204
You're hard to kill, but...
Woman, release his pain.

557
01:02:52,104 --> 01:02:54,698
Kibagami Jubei?

558
01:02:54,740 --> 01:02:57,709
Yes. But we've already
killed them all.

559
01:02:57,743 --> 01:03:00,439
Idiot! They still live.

560
01:03:01,947 --> 01:03:03,380
I'll kill him, for sure!

561
01:03:03,415 --> 01:03:08,045
Stay where you are.
Lure them there and kill them.

562
01:03:08,087 --> 01:03:09,349
Understand?

563
01:03:09,388 --> 01:03:10,753
Yes.

564
01:03:16,061 --> 01:03:18,723
Never would I have
imagined to see him here.

565
01:03:18,764 --> 01:03:21,232
I look forward to
seeing you again, Jubei.

566
01:03:23,002 --> 01:03:24,435
Gemma!

567
01:03:29,608 --> 01:03:31,098
I'm sorry.

568
01:03:31,744 --> 01:03:35,680
Forget it. I take it the castle
retainers haven't taken any action?

569
01:03:37,449 --> 01:03:39,781
It's been two hours.

570
01:03:40,419 --> 01:03:41,784
I see.

571
01:03:45,691 --> 01:03:49,422
Why... You knew it was a trap,
but you came to help me.

572
01:03:49,461 --> 01:03:52,726
It was stupid.
Why risk your life for me?

573
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:54,790
Because you're my comrade.

574
01:03:54,967 --> 01:03:56,127
Comrade?

575
01:03:56,168 --> 01:04:00,605
Yes. We've saved each other
over and over since yesterday.

576
01:04:00,639 --> 01:04:01,799
You're a precious
friend to me.

577
01:04:11,116 --> 01:04:12,447
Stay!

578
01:04:12,484 --> 01:04:15,078
The Mochizuki clan
is sitting this one out.

579
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:17,179
Your mission is over.

580
01:04:17,223 --> 01:04:20,715
No, it isn't.
I'm still in debt to you.

581
01:04:22,494 --> 01:04:23,984
You can pay it back later.

582
01:04:24,864 --> 01:04:27,094
Not if you're dead!

583
01:04:27,132 --> 01:04:28,997
I'll repay it here!

584
01:04:39,111 --> 01:04:40,840
What are you doing?

585
01:04:46,852 --> 01:04:50,310
The old man told me how
to counteract the poison.

586
01:04:51,690 --> 01:04:53,783
"Kill poison with poison."

587
01:04:53,826 --> 01:04:58,092
He said if you make love
to me, you'll be cured.

588
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,528
Take me...

589
01:05:57,623 --> 01:06:00,217
Why?!
You'll die if you don't!

590
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,224
Why...? JUBEl!

591
01:06:33,959 --> 01:06:36,860
We've been waiting!
Load the ship immediately!

592
01:07:03,655 --> 01:07:05,987
You! Well,
I warned you, didn't l?

593
01:07:06,025 --> 01:07:10,121
We're screwed.
We'll never beat that many men.

594
01:07:10,696 --> 01:07:15,133
I don't intend to let them go.
We'll make our stand soon.

595
01:07:15,667 --> 01:07:16,929
What are you planning?

596
01:07:16,969 --> 01:07:19,961
When they finish loading
the gold onto the ship...

597
01:07:20,005 --> 01:07:21,996
...go to the tower
and ring the bell.

598
01:07:22,041 --> 01:07:25,477
While they're distracted,
I'll sneak onboard the ship.

599
01:07:25,511 --> 01:07:28,480
When we're out at sea,
we won't need any storm.

600
01:07:28,514 --> 01:07:30,311
I'll sink it myself.

601
01:07:30,349 --> 01:07:31,976
Very well.

602
01:07:32,017 --> 01:07:36,010
By the way, did you make
love to the ninja girl?

603
01:07:37,356 --> 01:07:41,349
None of your damn business!
Now get going!

604
01:08:03,348 --> 01:08:06,340
Gemma... Where are you?

605
01:08:06,385 --> 01:08:09,548
When I die, I'll take
you to hell with me!

606
01:08:41,753 --> 01:08:44,153
The Mochizuki clan?!
They're moving against them!

607
01:08:49,695 --> 01:08:52,061
Ah, Kagero!
You've done a fine job.

608
01:08:52,097 --> 01:08:55,726
Hurry, before they get away!
Where are the others?

609
01:08:55,767 --> 01:08:58,634
Don't worry. They've
got this place surrounded.

610
01:08:59,104 --> 01:09:01,095
Then hurry!

611
01:09:19,424 --> 01:09:21,119
Jubei...

612
01:09:29,168 --> 01:09:30,795
Kagero!

613
01:09:32,104 --> 01:09:33,696
Stop! It's a trap!

614
01:09:34,406 --> 01:09:38,365
Fools! Sakaki Hyobu
died two days ago.

615
01:09:52,824 --> 01:09:54,724
I killed him personally.

616
01:09:55,127 --> 01:09:57,994
GEMMA!!!

617
01:10:24,890 --> 01:10:28,189
Sir, please get
aboard the ship quickly.

618
01:10:28,227 --> 01:10:31,856
The retainers of the
Shogun of the Dark are waiting.

619
01:10:32,831 --> 01:10:36,858
Leave Jubei to me.
Upon my honor, I will not fail.

620
01:10:38,036 --> 01:10:41,870
Please grant me
this one wish.

621
01:10:45,544 --> 01:10:47,375
Very well then. Go.

622
01:11:15,240 --> 01:11:19,233
Stay out of this. Don't shame me
any more than you already have.

623
01:11:21,847 --> 01:11:23,872
So, you are Gemma?

624
01:11:23,915 --> 01:11:27,510
The Mochizuki clan
suspect nothing, correct?

625
01:11:27,552 --> 01:11:29,520
Yes. All is well.

626
01:11:29,554 --> 01:11:33,957
You've done a splendid job.
I admire you Devils of Kimon.

627
01:11:33,992 --> 01:11:36,893
The Shogun of the Dark
will be pleased.

628
01:12:09,961 --> 01:12:12,395
Writhe in pain before you die.

629
01:12:47,999 --> 01:12:50,968
Yurimaru seems to have
suffered some ill fortune!

630
01:12:51,002 --> 01:12:54,494
How careless of him
to have fallen into my trap.

631
01:12:55,941 --> 01:12:58,671
It was your own fault,
Yurimaru.

632
01:13:02,080 --> 01:13:03,513
Let's go.

633
01:13:06,318 --> 01:13:07,342
Kagero!

634
01:13:16,995 --> 01:13:19,361
Hang on! Kagero!

635
01:13:23,034 --> 01:13:24,695
Jubei...

636
01:13:24,736 --> 01:13:27,364
I told you not to come.

637
01:13:27,706 --> 01:13:31,369
I wanted...to apologize...

638
01:13:34,713 --> 01:13:37,181
It was the first time...

639
01:13:37,215 --> 01:13:41,015
You didn't treat
me like a ninja woman...

640
01:13:41,052 --> 01:13:44,385
...but like
a normal woman.

641
01:13:45,223 --> 01:13:49,057
I knew I was becoming attracted
to you, and I was afraid.

642
01:13:49,094 --> 01:13:53,394
So I tried to push you away.
Forgive me...

643
01:13:56,034 --> 01:13:59,401
I don't care what
you think of me!

644
01:14:00,739 --> 01:14:05,403
If for an antidote...or out
of pity...I don't care...

645
01:14:06,077 --> 01:14:09,410
I just wish...that
you'd made love to me.

646
01:14:16,421 --> 01:14:20,721
I was stupid...and weak.

647
01:14:20,759 --> 01:14:24,092
Why couldn't I have
been more honest?

648
01:14:24,396 --> 01:14:28,093
Enough.
Don't say any more...!

649
01:15:16,781 --> 01:15:22,481
Jubei...
I'm glad...I met you...

650
01:16:56,581 --> 01:17:02,247
Gemma, with the gold's help
our dream will soon be reality.

651
01:17:02,287 --> 01:17:03,379
"Our" dream?

652
01:17:03,421 --> 01:17:06,413
Our great dream to
topple the Shogunate...

653
01:17:06,458 --> 01:17:09,484
...and restore the reign
of the House of Toyotomi.

654
01:17:09,527 --> 01:17:11,495
You don't understand...

655
01:17:11,529 --> 01:17:15,226
How we, the former retainers
of Toyotomi, have suffered.

656
01:17:15,367 --> 01:17:18,996
Now it'll be the Tokugawa who
suffer the agony and torment.

657
01:17:19,037 --> 01:17:21,972
We'll use the gold to buy the
most advanced weapons from Spain...

658
01:17:22,007 --> 01:17:24,942
...and defeat the
Tokugawa government.

659
01:17:24,976 --> 01:17:29,379
That is the dream of all of us who
work for the Shogun of the Dark.

660
01:17:30,048 --> 01:17:31,709
Nonsense.

661
01:17:33,051 --> 01:17:34,541
What did you say?!

662
01:17:34,586 --> 01:17:36,281
I said nonsense.

663
01:17:36,321 --> 01:17:39,347
Hold your tongue!
You're a mere ninja!

664
01:17:39,391 --> 01:17:41,325
My dream is different.

665
01:17:41,359 --> 01:17:44,294
The gold isn't going
to the Shogun of the Dark.

666
01:17:44,329 --> 01:17:45,023
What?!

667
01:17:45,063 --> 01:17:47,361
We, the Devils of Kimon,
will take the gold.

668
01:17:47,399 --> 01:17:48,991
You impudent...!

669
01:17:51,069 --> 01:17:55,369
I'll use it to organize the most
powerful army of ninja ever.

670
01:17:55,407 --> 01:18:00,208
And we'll rule the country with
terror and power from the shadows.

671
01:18:00,245 --> 01:18:02,975
Anyone who opposes me,
Tokugawa or Toyotomi...

672
01:18:03,014 --> 01:18:06,074
...even the Shogun of the Dark
himself, shall die.

673
01:18:07,686 --> 01:18:11,747
Meaning the true Shogun
of the Dark...will be me.

674
01:18:29,107 --> 01:18:35,046
Well now, you're here!
I was just wishing you'd come.

675
01:18:35,080 --> 01:18:36,741
I'm glad to hear that.

676
01:18:36,781 --> 01:18:38,248
Of course.

677
01:18:38,283 --> 01:18:41,719
Without your help, sinking
a big ship like this...

678
01:18:42,787 --> 01:18:44,778
...would be impossible!

679
01:18:50,161 --> 01:18:52,129
Pathetic old fool!

680
01:18:52,797 --> 01:18:54,321
Over here.

681
01:19:04,642 --> 01:19:06,075
What's wrong?

682
01:19:06,111 --> 01:19:09,444
Fire in the hold!
We're gonna sink!

683
01:19:09,481 --> 01:19:11,108
Idiot!
Put out the fire!

684
01:19:11,149 --> 01:19:13,481
lmpossible!
It's a sea of flame!

685
01:19:13,518 --> 01:19:16,078
Put it out! Fight it!

686
01:19:16,121 --> 01:19:18,146
Move it! Move it!

687
01:19:18,790 --> 01:19:20,815
Forget it! Run!

688
01:19:29,134 --> 01:19:30,795
Master Gemma!

689
01:19:30,835 --> 01:19:32,462
Pass this message to everyone:.

690
01:19:32,504 --> 01:19:37,771
"Abandon ship and hide yourselves.
I'll call for you someday."

691
01:19:37,809 --> 01:19:38,798
Go.

692
01:20:18,216 --> 01:20:19,877
Gemma!

693
01:20:21,719 --> 01:20:25,211
I see you brought back some
devils from your trip to hell.

694
01:20:33,765 --> 01:20:35,528
Kibagami Jubei...

695
01:20:35,567 --> 01:20:39,059
I should've finished you
with my own hands.

696
01:20:39,437 --> 01:20:42,235
Stop your whining.
It's too late.

697
01:20:43,875 --> 01:20:47,538
You want to avenge
the ninja girl Kagero?

698
01:20:47,579 --> 01:20:50,844
She was trash in comparison
to what I've lost.

699
01:20:54,886 --> 01:20:56,854
You alone I can't forgive!

700
01:21:50,174 --> 01:21:53,905
I won't kill you yet.
Not before I make you suffer.

701
01:21:53,945 --> 01:21:56,277
I'll make you pay
for smashing my dream.

702
01:21:56,314 --> 01:22:01,115
Your dream? That you were going
to be the true Shogun of the Dark?

703
01:22:01,920 --> 01:22:04,150
Don't make me laugh.

704
01:22:04,188 --> 01:22:09,125
If you became shogun, you'd
make this a world of devils.

705
01:22:09,661 --> 01:22:11,959
If you enjoy
their company so much...

706
01:22:11,996 --> 01:22:14,624
...then go back to hell!

707
01:22:31,649 --> 01:22:34,015
I'll kill you...!

708
01:22:36,688 --> 01:22:38,679
No one can kill me.

709
01:22:43,094 --> 01:22:46,029
You of all people
should know by now...

710
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:52,026
I am immortal.

711
01:22:55,006 --> 01:22:57,031
Is that so?

712
01:23:11,723 --> 01:23:15,853
If you keep coming
back to life...

713
01:23:15,893 --> 01:23:19,727
...then I'll kill you as
many times as it takes!

714
01:24:31,402 --> 01:24:32,960
You fool!

715
01:25:22,186 --> 01:25:25,178
GEMMA! HERE YOU DlE!

716
01:26:23,548 --> 01:26:24,913
Jubei!

717
01:26:24,949 --> 01:26:29,579
You seem to be rid of the
poison, thanks to Kagero.

718
01:26:29,620 --> 01:26:32,589
The combination of a poison-
tasting ninja girl and...

719
01:26:32,623 --> 01:26:36,559
...a talented lone wolf worked out
even better than I had planned.

720
01:26:36,594 --> 01:26:38,255
Go away.

721
01:26:42,433 --> 01:26:47,234
By the way, I'm sorry about
losing Kagero. A real pity, that!

722
01:26:47,271 --> 01:26:50,206
But for a scant few moments,
she was able to...

723
01:26:50,241 --> 01:26:53,733
...be an ordinary girl
and make love with you.

724
01:26:54,278 --> 01:26:56,576
Was that part
of your plan, too?

725
01:26:56,614 --> 01:26:59,208
Exactly. To read and
control peoples' hearts...

726
01:26:59,250 --> 01:27:01,741
...is the true secret
of the ninja.

727
01:27:03,254 --> 01:27:07,953
Still, only true sincerity
can move the human heart.

728
01:27:07,992 --> 01:27:10,961
A twisted old bastard
like me couldn't do it.

729
01:27:10,995 --> 01:27:14,863
You're a hell of a guy.
I really admire you.

730
01:27:14,899 --> 01:27:17,595
As promised, I'll be waiting in
Edo with your 100 gold pieces.

731
01:27:17,635 --> 01:27:19,626
Come and get it,
if you're still alive.

732
01:27:26,644 --> 01:27:30,045
That makes us even.
Now never cross my path again.

733
01:27:30,982 --> 01:27:34,645
You've beaten me. I thought l'd
shut your mouth in Edo, but...

734
01:27:34,685 --> 01:27:38,917
Still, in your condition you likely
won't even make it to the shore.

735
01:27:38,956 --> 01:27:41,652
Everything will end
just as I planned.

736
01:28:27,438 --> 01:28:32,205
Come with me, let's go
out to see the stars.

737
01:28:33,844 --> 01:28:39,043
Evening has only just begun.

738
01:28:40,017 --> 01:28:46,320
I don't want anything,
only for you...

739
01:28:46,357 --> 01:28:52,728
...to be at my side,
a smile on your face.

740
01:28:52,763 --> 01:28:57,564
A distant summer,
the two of us alone...

741
01:28:59,203 --> 01:29:04,732
Sitting on the beach
we used to walk.

742
01:29:05,343 --> 01:29:11,714
Trying to retrieve
the gentleness...

743
01:29:11,749 --> 01:29:16,413
...that we left behind.

744
01:29:18,089 --> 01:29:24,392
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all...

745
01:29:24,428 --> 01:29:29,422
I can still
hear it even now.

746
01:29:30,735 --> 01:29:36,696
It embraces
my wandering heart...

747
01:29:36,741 --> 01:29:42,771
...just like the cool night wind.

748
01:30:08,672 --> 01:30:13,473
Looking at you,
only you...

749
01:30:14,945 --> 01:30:20,474
...saying things
hard for us to say.

750
01:30:21,152 --> 01:30:27,421
Times may have changed,
but I know...

751
01:30:27,458 --> 01:30:32,327
...my feelings are
still the same for you.

752
01:30:33,864 --> 01:30:40,167
A distant ballad sung
to no one at all...

753
01:30:40,204 --> 01:30:45,164
I can still
hear it even now.

754
01:30:46,444 --> 01:30:52,440
It embraces
my wandering heart...

755
01:30:52,483 --> 01:31:00,515
...just like the cool night wind.
