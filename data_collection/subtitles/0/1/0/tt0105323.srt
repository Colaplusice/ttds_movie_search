1
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,501
I wish you wouldn't do that around me.
It's so filthy!

2
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:06,102
- Don't give me a problem
about the cigarettes.
- It's such a filthy habit.

3
00:03:06,202 --> 00:03:08,503
Oh, my God!
Look at this.

4
00:03:11,203 --> 00:03:13,804
Oh, Jesus!
This is so appalling!

5
00:03:16,105 --> 00:03:18,005
I can't believe it!

6
00:03:18,106 --> 00:03:20,806
I can't believe
they gave it to him.

7
00:03:26,808 --> 00:03:28,709
Ah, this is pathetic!

8
00:03:28,809 --> 00:03:31,109
Now he's a loser
with a Jaguar.

9
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,611
Seriously, who did he have to blow
to get that thing?

10
00:03:36,111 --> 00:03:38,212
- Good morning, sir.
- Mr. Willis.

11
00:03:38,312 --> 00:03:40,812
- It's really, uh,
- Mr. Trask!

12
00:03:41,113 --> 00:03:43,013
quite a piece
of machinery.

13
00:03:43,113 --> 00:03:45,914
- Good morning, Havemeyer.
- Morning to you, sir.

14
00:03:46,014 --> 00:03:47,915
- Bene!
- Bene?

15
00:03:48,115 --> 00:03:50,315
- Bene! Fabulous!
- What's fabulous?

16
00:03:50,415 --> 00:03:52,616
That fine piece of steel
you have back there.

17
00:03:52,716 --> 00:03:54,717
Ah, you don't think
I deserve it.

18
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,918
No, sir. On the contrary.
I think it's great.

19
00:03:59,318 --> 00:04:03,619
Should the headmaster of Baird be seen
putt-putting around in some junker?

20
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,320
In fact, I think the
board of trustees have had...

21
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,721
their first, true stroke
of inspiration in some time.

22
00:04:09,821 --> 00:04:13,122
Thank you, Havemeyer.
I'll take that at face value.

23
00:04:14,223 --> 00:04:16,323
I'd expect
nothing less, sir.

24
00:04:16,423 --> 00:04:18,224
Have a good day.

25
00:04:21,225 --> 00:04:23,125
- Morning, Mrs. Hunsaker.
- Good morning.

26
00:04:23,225 --> 00:04:25,926
What have we here,
Murderer's Row?

27
00:04:32,628 --> 00:04:35,129
- What was that about?
- Nothing. Just saying hello.

28
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,030
I like to say hello
to Headmaster Trask.

29
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:41,731
Sugarbush. Lift tickets and
condo vouchers.

30
00:04:42,031 --> 00:04:45,832
- I thought we were goin' to Stowe.
- Sugarbush is Stowe, Jimmy.

31
00:04:45,932 --> 00:04:49,934
We're doing it right. Thanksgiving
in Vermont, Christmas in Switzerland...

32
00:04:50,034 --> 00:04:52,234
- Christmas in Gstaad is gonna cost us...
- 'Staad.

33
00:04:52,334 --> 00:04:54,935
The "G" is silent.
'Staad. George?

34
00:04:55,635 --> 00:04:57,036
- 'Staad.
- Trent?

35
00:04:57,136 --> 00:04:59,537
- 'Staad, man.
- So what about 'Staad?

36
00:04:59,637 --> 00:05:01,437
Fine. The "G" may be silent,

37
00:05:01,537 --> 00:05:04,238
but it's gonna take at least
three grand to get there.

38
00:05:04,338 --> 00:05:08,339
- I'll talk to my father.
- Better yet, have my father
talk to your father.

39
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:11,040
Or my father
talk to your father.

40
00:05:13,041 --> 00:05:15,641
You goin' home
this weekend, Chas?

41
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,642
Uh, I don't know.

42
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:20,643
You goin' home to fuckin' ldaho
for Thanksgiving?

43
00:05:20,743 --> 00:05:22,544
I'm from Oregon.

44
00:05:23,044 --> 00:05:25,044
I meant fuckin' Oregon.

45
00:05:25,244 --> 00:05:27,945
Charlie, how do you feel about skiing?

46
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:32,046
You in the mood for
the white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

47
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,848
Got a deal going.
20% off for my friends.

48
00:05:36,048 --> 00:05:38,949
My father set it up.
Christmas in Switzerland.

49
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:41,249
- 'Staad.
- Gstaad. Dropping the "G" is phony.

50
00:05:41,349 --> 00:05:44,550
- You said everybody says 'Staad.
- Not if you've been there.

51
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:47,851
Easter in Bermuda,
then Kentucky Derby weekend.

52
00:05:47,951 --> 00:05:50,052
We could fit you in, kid.

53
00:05:50,152 --> 00:05:53,753
Well, how much are
these white-bosomed slopes of Vermont?

54
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:55,854
Twelve hundred!

55
00:05:56,054 --> 00:05:59,455
Includes a nine-course,
champagne thanksgiving dinner.

56
00:06:00,355 --> 00:06:03,256
$1200 is a little rich
for my blood, Harry.

57
00:06:04,056 --> 00:06:06,057
Well, how short
are you?

58
00:06:06,157 --> 00:06:08,057
How short, Harry?

59
00:06:08,258 --> 00:06:11,959
So short it wouldn't be worth the
trouble of you and George to measure.

60
00:06:12,059 --> 00:06:14,960
- But, thanks for askin', all right?
- Mm-hmm.

61
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:19,461
- If you change your mind...
- What'd you do that for?
You know he's on aid.

62
00:06:19,661 --> 00:06:22,062
On major holidays, Willis, it's
customary for the lord of the manor...

63
00:06:22,162 --> 00:06:25,863
to offer drippings to the poor.
- You're so full of shit!

64
00:06:52,371 --> 00:06:54,572
- Hi. Mrs. Rossi?
- Yes?

65
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,373
I'm here about
the weekend job.

66
00:06:58,973 --> 00:07:00,574
Come on in.

67
00:07:05,475 --> 00:07:08,276
Does he got pimples?
He hates pimples.

68
00:07:08,576 --> 00:07:10,276
Francine, be quiet.

69
00:07:10,376 --> 00:07:12,477
Pimples. Pimples.
Yeah.

70
00:07:13,177 --> 00:07:15,078
Shush!
I'm sorry.

71
00:07:15,678 --> 00:07:18,779
- The school gave me your name,
but I've forgotten it.
- It's Charlie Simms.

72
00:07:18,879 --> 00:07:20,880
- How are you, Charlie?
- Fine, thanks.

73
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:22,680
Right this way.

74
00:07:25,781 --> 00:07:29,082
- You're available the whole weekend?
- Uh, yeah.

75
00:07:29,782 --> 00:07:31,083
- Not going home for Thanksgiving?
- No.

76
00:07:31,183 --> 00:07:32,483
Good.

77
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:38,085
They put him in a veteran's home,
but he hated it,

78
00:07:38,185 --> 00:07:40,886
so I told my dad
that we'd take him.

79
00:07:42,486 --> 00:07:45,687
Before you go in, do you mind
my telling you a few things?

80
00:07:45,787 --> 00:07:49,188
Don't "sir" him and don't ask him
too many questions.

81
00:07:50,289 --> 00:07:54,290
And if he staggers a little when
he gets up, don't pay any attention.

82
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:58,591
Charlie, I can tell you're
the right person for the job,

83
00:07:59,992 --> 00:08:02,993
and Uncle Frank's
gonna like you a lot too.

84
00:08:03,793 --> 00:08:06,294
Uh, where you gonna be
this weekend?

85
00:08:06,394 --> 00:08:08,494
We're driving to Albany.

86
00:08:08,594 --> 00:08:11,295
Donny, my husband,
has family there.

87
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:20,798
- Do you want Tommy in or out?
- Leave him out!

88
00:08:20,898 --> 00:08:24,599
He's chasin' that Calico ginch
from the track houses again!

89
00:08:31,201 --> 00:08:34,002
Down deep, the man
is a lump of sugar.

90
00:08:54,608 --> 00:08:57,009
- Sir?
- Don't call me sir!

91
00:08:58,209 --> 00:09:00,710
I-I'm sorry.
I mean mister, sir.

92
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,511
Uh-oh, we got a moron here,
is that it?

93
00:09:05,612 --> 00:09:07,912
No, mister...
Uh, that is...

94
00:09:09,613 --> 00:09:12,114
Uh, Lieutenant.
Yes, sir, Lieu...

95
00:09:12,514 --> 00:09:14,414
Lieutenant Colonel.

96
00:09:14,815 --> 00:09:18,616
26 years on the line, nobody ever
busted me four grades before.

97
00:09:19,716 --> 00:09:21,817
Get in here,
you idiot!

98
00:09:28,319 --> 00:09:31,820
Come a little closer. I wanna get a
better look at ya.

99
00:09:39,422 --> 00:09:41,423
How's your skin, son?

100
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:43,823
My skin, sir?

101
00:09:44,324 --> 00:09:47,324
- Oh, for Christ's sake.
- I'm sorry, I don...

102
00:09:47,925 --> 00:09:50,726
Just call me Frank.
Call me Mr. Slade.

103
00:09:51,626 --> 00:09:55,027
Call me Colonel, if you must.
Just don't call me sir.

104
00:09:55,527 --> 00:09:57,428
All right, Colonel.

105
00:10:00,529 --> 00:10:02,729
Simms, Charles.
A senior.

106
00:10:03,329 --> 00:10:06,330
- You on student aid, Simms?
- Uh, yes, I am.

107
00:10:06,830 --> 00:10:09,331
For "student aid"
read "crook".

108
00:10:10,532 --> 00:10:13,132
Your father peddles car telephones
at a 300% markup.

109
00:10:13,232 --> 00:10:16,733
Your mother works on heavy commission
in a camera store.

110
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,634
Graduated to it
from espresso machines.

111
00:10:19,834 --> 00:10:21,335
Hah-hah!

112
00:10:26,036 --> 00:10:29,037
What are you, dying of
some wasting disease?

113
00:10:31,038 --> 00:10:33,539
No, I'm right...
I'm right here.

114
00:10:34,239 --> 00:10:36,840
I know exactly where
your body is.

115
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:41,241
What I'm lookin' for
is some indication of a brain.

116
00:10:42,041 --> 00:10:44,642
Too much football
without a helmet?

117
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:47,643
Hah! Lyndon's line
on Gerry Ford.

118
00:10:49,744 --> 00:10:52,644
Deputy Debriefer,
Paris Peace Talks, '68.

119
00:10:53,545 --> 00:10:57,246
Snagged the Silver Star
and a silver bar. Threw me into G-2.

120
00:10:57,646 --> 00:10:59,046
G-2?

121
00:10:59,747 --> 00:11:02,447
Intelligence,
of which you have none.

122
00:11:06,049 --> 00:11:07,849
Where you from?

123
00:11:08,249 --> 00:11:10,250
Um, Gresham, Oregon,

124
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:13,251
s... Colonel.

125
00:11:13,651 --> 00:11:16,452
What does your daddy do
in Gresham, Oregon?

126
00:11:16,552 --> 00:11:18,652
Hmm? Count wood chips?

127
00:11:20,053 --> 00:11:23,454
Uh, my stepfather and my mom
run a convenience store.

128
00:11:23,954 --> 00:11:27,255
- How convenient! What time they open?
- 5:00 A.M.

129
00:11:28,956 --> 00:11:30,956
- Close?
- 1:00 A.M.

130
00:11:31,356 --> 00:11:32,957
Hard workers.

131
00:11:33,457 --> 00:11:35,758
You got me all
misty-eyed!

132
00:11:39,059 --> 00:11:42,560
So, what are you doin' here
in this sparrow-fart town?

133
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,361
I...
I attend Baird.

134
00:11:47,261 --> 00:11:48,962
Attend Baird!

135
00:11:50,162 --> 00:11:52,763
I know you go
to the Baird school.

136
00:11:52,863 --> 00:11:55,264
Point is,
how do you afford it,

137
00:11:55,864 --> 00:11:59,965
even with the student aid and
the folks back home hustlin' Cornnuts?

138
00:12:00,665 --> 00:12:03,766
I won a, uh,
Young America merit scholarship.

139
00:12:05,567 --> 00:12:07,067
Whoo-ah!

140
00:12:09,268 --> 00:12:11,368
Glory, glory, Hallelujah

141
00:12:13,369 --> 00:12:15,470
Glory, glory, Hallelujah

142
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:21,872
Who's there?

143
00:12:22,172 --> 00:12:24,473
That little piece of tail?

144
00:12:27,473 --> 00:12:29,474
Get her outta here!

145
00:12:38,477 --> 00:12:39,777
Yeah.

146
00:12:41,478 --> 00:12:43,878
Can't believe
they're my blood.

147
00:12:48,980 --> 00:12:51,881
I.Q. of sloths and
the manners of banshees.

148
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,482
He's a mechanic,
she's a homemaker.

149
00:12:55,582 --> 00:12:57,983
He knows as much about cars
as a beauty queen,

150
00:12:58,083 --> 00:13:01,084
and she bakes cookies,
taste like wing nuts.

151
00:13:01,884 --> 00:13:04,385
As for the tots,
they're twits.

152
00:13:05,485 --> 00:13:09,086
How's your skin, son?
I like my aides to be presentable.

153
00:13:11,587 --> 00:13:14,088
Well, I...
I've had a few zits.

154
00:13:15,288 --> 00:13:19,089
Um, but my roommate, he lent me
his Clinique because he's from...

155
00:13:20,790 --> 00:13:23,791
"The History of My Skin",
by Charles Simms.

156
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,292
You patronizing me,
peewee? Hmm?

157
00:13:28,592 --> 00:13:31,593
You givin' me that old
prep school palaver?

158
00:13:32,293 --> 00:13:33,994
Baird School!

159
00:13:35,094 --> 00:13:38,295
A bunch of runny-nosed snots
in tweed jackets...

160
00:13:38,595 --> 00:13:40,996
all studyin'
to be George Bush.

161
00:13:43,097 --> 00:13:44,497
Well...

162
00:13:45,097 --> 00:13:48,398
I believe President Bush
went to Andover, Colonel.

163
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:53,500
You sharpshootin' me, punk?

164
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,001
Is that what you're doin'?

165
00:13:57,101 --> 00:13:59,301
Don't you
sharpshoot me!

166
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:02,302
You'll give me forty.

167
00:14:02,803 --> 00:14:05,303
Then you're gonna give me
forty more.

168
00:14:05,403 --> 00:14:08,504
Then you're gonna pull K.P.,
the grease pit!

169
00:14:08,804 --> 00:14:11,805
I'll rub your nose
in enlisted men's crud...

170
00:14:13,206 --> 00:14:16,607
till you don't know which end is up!
You understand?

171
00:14:17,407 --> 00:14:18,707
Yeah.

172
00:14:19,408 --> 00:14:22,809
- What do you want?
- What do you mean, what do I want?

173
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:24,909
What do you want here?

174
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:28,811
I wa-want a job.

175
00:14:29,511 --> 00:14:31,011
A job!

176
00:14:31,511 --> 00:14:33,612
Yeah, I want a job
so I can make, you know,

177
00:14:33,712 --> 00:14:36,213
my plane fare home
for Christmas.

178
00:14:36,513 --> 00:14:37,813
Oh.

179
00:14:39,214 --> 00:14:41,314
God, you're touching!

180
00:14:52,918 --> 00:14:54,618
From the banks

181
00:14:56,019 --> 00:14:58,219
Of the mighty Mississippi

182
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,921
Workin' the whole night through

183
00:15:05,222 --> 00:15:07,422
Till the riverboat gamblers

184
00:15:08,223 --> 00:15:10,323
Stop to make a killin'

185
00:15:11,324 --> 00:15:13,424
Bring it on back to you

186
00:15:14,725 --> 00:15:16,825
Still here, poormouth?

187
00:15:17,225 --> 00:15:18,626
Hmm?

188
00:15:19,226 --> 00:15:21,627
Convenience store...
my ass!

189
00:15:24,728 --> 00:15:27,628
Hustlin' jalapeno dips
to the appleseeds.

190
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:31,330
Go on.

191
00:15:32,130 --> 00:15:33,630
Dismissed.

192
00:15:36,631 --> 00:15:38,132
Dismissed!

193
00:15:45,734 --> 00:15:47,335
Evangeline

194
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:50,335
Evangeline

195
00:15:52,336 --> 00:15:53,937
Mrs. Rossi?

196
00:15:54,837 --> 00:15:57,538
Charlie, we're up here!
Come on up.

197
00:15:59,838 --> 00:16:02,039
- Uh, this is Donny.
- Hey, Charlie.

198
00:16:02,139 --> 00:16:03,439
Hi.

199
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:07,441
Uh, Mrs. Rossi,
I got the feelin' I screwed up.

200
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:10,842
- Oh, you couldn't have.
- It was a bad interview.

201
00:16:11,342 --> 00:16:13,743
That was no interview, Charlie.
You're it.

202
00:16:13,843 --> 00:16:16,944
You're the only one that showed up.
You have to take the job.

203
00:16:17,044 --> 00:16:20,945
He sleeps a lot. You can
watch television, call your girlfriend.

204
00:16:21,745 --> 00:16:23,646
I promise you,
an easy 300 bucks.

205
00:16:23,746 --> 00:16:26,046
I don't get an easy feeling.

206
00:16:31,248 --> 00:16:33,749
His bark is worse
than his bite.

207
00:16:34,449 --> 00:16:37,150
He was a great soldier,
a real hero.

208
00:16:37,850 --> 00:16:39,951
The man grows on you!

209
00:16:41,051 --> 00:16:43,852
By Sunday night,
you'll be best friends.

210
00:16:45,252 --> 00:16:47,053
Charlie, please.

211
00:16:48,853 --> 00:16:52,454
I want to get away for a few days,
and Uncle Frank won't come with us.

212
00:16:52,554 --> 00:16:56,056
Six months ago, he could
sometimes tell light from dark,

213
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:58,356
but now there's nothing.

214
00:16:58,556 --> 00:17:01,957
I feel better having
someone else around just in case.

215
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,059
Please?

216
00:17:12,661 --> 00:17:14,761
Okay, Mrs. Rossi.
Sure.

217
00:17:15,261 --> 00:17:18,062
- Thank you, Charlie.
- Come here, you.

218
00:17:27,565 --> 00:17:29,266
There you go.

219
00:17:29,566 --> 00:17:31,666
Chas! Chas, hold up!

220
00:17:33,667 --> 00:17:35,568
- How ya doin'?
- I'm good.

221
00:17:35,668 --> 00:17:37,368
That's great.

222
00:17:37,768 --> 00:17:40,569
This can't go out.
This is on reserve.

223
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:45,171
Here's the thing.

224
00:17:45,471 --> 00:17:47,671
I need the book tonight...

225
00:17:48,972 --> 00:17:52,673
for a Thanksgiving quiz with
big-shit Preston in the morning.
- Yeah, I know.

226
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:55,074
That's why he put it on reserve.
This is our only copy.

227
00:17:55,174 --> 00:17:57,674
Chas, I'm pullin'
an all-nighter.

228
00:17:57,974 --> 00:18:00,575
Without that book
I'm dead, okay?

229
00:18:02,776 --> 00:18:05,877
If it's not back by 7:30,
it's gonna be my ass.

230
00:18:06,077 --> 00:18:08,278
Oh, I promise.
I promise.

231
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,381
- Got it?
- Yeah.

232
00:18:32,985 --> 00:18:35,386
Just a second.
I gotta lock up.

233
00:18:40,287 --> 00:18:41,588
Okay.

234
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:46,689
God, can you wait to get out
of this dump or what?

235
00:18:51,791 --> 00:18:53,691
Where you guys
going skiing again?

236
00:18:53,791 --> 00:18:56,892
- Sugarloaf or...
- It's bush, Chas, Sugarbush.

237
00:19:06,896 --> 00:19:09,496
That's my boys.
What are you doin'?

238
00:19:09,896 --> 00:19:11,997
Keep your voice down!

239
00:19:12,897 --> 00:19:15,198
I'll tell you about it
in the morning.

240
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:16,999
- Shh.
- Wha...

241
00:19:20,700 --> 00:19:24,501
- Miss Hunsaker, have a nice day?
- George, why all the noise?

242
00:19:25,001 --> 00:19:27,202
It's Hunsaker! Go! Go!

243
00:19:28,102 --> 00:19:30,503
I was just
messin' around with Chas.

244
00:19:30,603 --> 00:19:33,604
- Good evening, Charles.
- Hi, Mrs. Hunsaker.

245
00:19:39,706 --> 00:19:41,706
- What was that?
- I don't know, ma'am.

246
00:19:41,806 --> 00:19:45,107
- Who were those boys?
What were they doing?
- Oh, who knows?

247
00:19:45,207 --> 00:19:47,208
- Charles?
- Um...

248
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:52,609
- Did you make this scarf yourseIf?
- No, George, I bought it.

249
00:19:52,710 --> 00:19:55,410
- 'Cause it's a beauty. It really is.
- Thank you, George.

250
00:19:55,510 --> 00:19:58,211
In case I don't see you before
the Thanksgiving holidays,

251
00:19:58,311 --> 00:20:01,212
- why don't you give me
one of your big hugs?
- Oh, George!

252
00:20:01,312 --> 00:20:03,213
- Please? Come on.
- Good evening, boys.

253
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:05,513
Good-bye,
Mrs. Hunsaker.

254
00:20:24,919 --> 00:20:27,420
Mr. Trask is our fearless leader,

255
00:20:29,221 --> 00:20:32,022
a man of learning,
a voracious reader.

256
00:20:34,022 --> 00:20:37,223
He could recite the "lliad"
in ancient Greek...

257
00:20:38,023 --> 00:20:41,024
while fishing for trout
in a rippling creek.

258
00:20:42,425 --> 00:20:45,226
Endowed with wisdom,
of judgement sound,

259
00:20:47,226 --> 00:20:50,227
nevertheless about him
the questions abound.

260
00:20:55,529 --> 00:20:58,630
How does Mr. Trask
make such wonderful deals?

261
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:04,131
Why did the trustees
buy him Jaguar wheels?

262
00:21:05,232 --> 00:21:07,232
He wasn't conniving!

263
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:09,333
He wasn't crass!

264
00:21:10,833 --> 00:21:13,234
He merely
puckered his lips...

265
00:21:15,435 --> 00:21:17,535
and kissed their ass!

266
00:21:35,441 --> 00:21:37,341
Come on.
Come on.

267
00:21:43,443 --> 00:21:45,844
One more!
One more, come on!

268
00:21:56,847 --> 00:21:58,148
Aah!

269
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,750
Fuck you!

270
00:22:13,853 --> 00:22:15,853
Mr. Simms, Mr. Willis.

271
00:22:17,954 --> 00:22:19,154
Hmm.

272
00:22:20,455 --> 00:22:24,656
Mrs. Hunsaker says that you gentlemen
were at a vantage point last night...

273
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,757
to observe who was
responsible for this, uh,

274
00:22:28,457 --> 00:22:29,758
stunt.

275
00:22:35,259 --> 00:22:36,860
Who was it?

276
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,861
I really couldn't
tell you, sir.

277
00:22:41,561 --> 00:22:44,962
Um, I thought I saw someone
fooling with the lamppost,

278
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:49,063
but by the time I pulled focus,
they were gone.

279
00:22:50,364 --> 00:22:51,964
Mr. Simms?

280
00:22:54,265 --> 00:22:55,966
I couldn't say.

281
00:22:58,266 --> 00:23:01,467
That automobile is not
just a possession of mine.

282
00:23:02,267 --> 00:23:05,969
That automobile was presented
to me by the Board of Trustees.

283
00:23:07,169 --> 00:23:11,570
It is a symbol of the standard
of excellence for which
this school is known,

284
00:23:12,471 --> 00:23:15,071
and I will not
have it tarnished.

285
00:23:15,572 --> 00:23:17,372
The automobile?

286
00:23:19,473 --> 00:23:21,673
The standard,
Mr. Willis.

287
00:23:25,174 --> 00:23:28,475
- What's your position, Mr. Simms?
- On what, sir?

288
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:31,676
On preserving the
reputation of Baird.

289
00:23:31,776 --> 00:23:34,577
- I'm for Baird.
- Then, who did it?

290
00:23:37,278 --> 00:23:39,679
I really couldn't say for sure.

291
00:23:45,081 --> 00:23:46,681
Very well.

292
00:23:54,083 --> 00:23:56,484
First thing Monday,
I'm convening a special session...

293
00:23:56,584 --> 00:23:58,985
of the student-faculty
disciplinary committee.

294
00:23:59,085 --> 00:24:01,686
As this is a matter which
concerns the whole school,

295
00:24:01,786 --> 00:24:04,586
the entire student body
will be present.

296
00:24:04,787 --> 00:24:07,387
There will be no classes,
no activities.

297
00:24:07,487 --> 00:24:09,588
Nothing will transpire
at this institution...

298
00:24:09,688 --> 00:24:12,389
until that proceeding
is concluded.

299
00:24:14,890 --> 00:24:18,591
And if, at that time,
we are no further along than we are now,

300
00:24:20,391 --> 00:24:22,492
I will expel you both.

301
00:24:27,694 --> 00:24:30,294
Mr. Willis,
would you excuse us?

302
00:24:33,895 --> 00:24:36,096
Have a nice Thanksgiving.

303
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,697
Thank you.
You too, Mr. Willis.

304
00:24:39,797 --> 00:24:41,198
I will.

305
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,400
Mr. Simms.

306
00:24:51,201 --> 00:24:53,902
I'm not quite through
with you yet.

307
00:25:03,705 --> 00:25:06,705
One of the few perks
of this office is that...

308
00:25:07,206 --> 00:25:11,007
I am empowered to handle
certain matters on my own as I see fit.

309
00:25:12,607 --> 00:25:14,508
Do you understand?

310
00:25:14,608 --> 00:25:16,508
- Yes, sir.
- Good.

311
00:25:17,209 --> 00:25:20,310
The Dean of Admissions at Harvard
and I have an arrangement.

312
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:23,711
Along with the usual sheaf of applicants
submitted by Baird,

313
00:25:23,811 --> 00:25:25,711
of which virtually,

314
00:25:25,911 --> 00:25:28,812
oh, two-thirds are
guaranteed admittance,

315
00:25:29,612 --> 00:25:31,313
I add one name,

316
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:36,415
somebody who's a standout
and yet, underprivileged;

317
00:25:37,115 --> 00:25:41,216
a student who cannot afford to pay
the board and tuition in Cambridge.

318
00:25:44,817 --> 00:25:48,318
Do you know on whose behalf
I drafted a memo this year?

319
00:25:48,618 --> 00:25:51,219
- No, sir.
- You. You, Mr. Simms.

320
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:59,822
Now can you tell me
who did it?

321
00:26:02,122 --> 00:26:04,023
No, sir, I can't.

322
00:26:05,323 --> 00:26:08,624
You take the weekend
to think about it, Mr. Simms.

323
00:26:10,525 --> 00:26:12,226
Good afternoon.

324
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:16,827
What'd he say?

325
00:26:17,427 --> 00:26:19,628
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean, nothing?

326
00:26:19,728 --> 00:26:22,029
He said the same thing.
He just said it over.

327
00:26:22,129 --> 00:26:24,129
You know what
he's doing?

328
00:26:24,229 --> 00:26:26,630
He's good-cop,
bad-coppin' us.

329
00:26:27,530 --> 00:26:29,731
He knows I'm old guard.
You're fringe.

330
00:26:29,831 --> 00:26:32,832
He's gonna bear down on me
and soft-soap you.

331
00:26:33,432 --> 00:26:36,133
Did he try to soft-soap you? Did he?

332
00:26:38,233 --> 00:26:39,434
No.

333
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:43,935
Chas, I detect a slight panic pulse
from you. Are you panicking?

334
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:46,336
- Yeah, a little.
- Come on.

335
00:26:46,536 --> 00:26:49,337
- You're on scholarship, right?
- Yeah.

336
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:53,038
You're on scholarship
from Oregon... at Baird.

337
00:26:54,638 --> 00:26:57,139
You're a long way from home, Chas.

338
00:26:57,639 --> 00:26:59,940
What's that got to do
with anything?

339
00:27:00,040 --> 00:27:02,341
I don't know how
it works out there.

340
00:27:02,441 --> 00:27:05,342
But how it works here?
We stick together.

341
00:27:06,042 --> 00:27:08,443
It's us against them,
no matter what.

342
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:11,744
We don't cover our ass.
We don't tell our parents.

343
00:27:12,544 --> 00:27:14,545
Stonewall everybody!

344
00:27:15,345 --> 00:27:17,746
And above all,
never, never...

345
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:22,747
Ieave any of us
twisting in the wind.

346
00:27:24,848 --> 00:27:26,548
And that's it.

347
00:27:26,848 --> 00:27:29,249
What does that have to do
with me being on scholarship?

348
00:27:29,349 --> 00:27:30,850
Hey, hey!

349
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:35,151
I'm just tryin' to bring you
up to speed, kid, that's it.

350
00:27:35,251 --> 00:27:36,651
Thanks.

351
00:27:39,652 --> 00:27:43,453
I'll tell you what. Give me a few hours
to figure out the moves,

352
00:27:43,954 --> 00:27:46,454
and call me tonight
in Vermont.

353
00:27:47,455 --> 00:27:50,456
I'll be at the Sugarbush lodge,
all right?

354
00:27:50,856 --> 00:27:52,356
All right.

355
00:27:53,556 --> 00:27:55,257
You all right?

356
00:27:56,057 --> 00:27:57,858
Yeah, I guess so.

357
00:27:59,058 --> 00:28:00,459
Okay.

358
00:28:03,059 --> 00:28:05,260
Try to keep him down
to four drinks a day.

359
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,261
If you can keep him down to forty,
you're doin' good.

360
00:28:08,361 --> 00:28:11,762
Try to water them down a little.
Do you know how to do that?

361
00:28:11,862 --> 00:28:15,963
- It's a long ride, honey!
- Get the bags in the car.
I'll be right out.

362
00:28:16,063 --> 00:28:19,164
Mommy, Mommy!
Don't forget Uncle Frank's walk.

363
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,665
Oh, ha... Yeah.

364
00:28:23,065 --> 00:28:25,466
Uh, you have to
air him out...

365
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:28,767
a little every day.

366
00:28:29,167 --> 00:28:32,368
Why don't you go on back there,
get yourself oriented?

367
00:28:32,468 --> 00:28:36,270
I'll come out in a minute,
give you telephone numbers and stuff.

368
00:28:37,070 --> 00:28:39,671
Well, I wouldn't try
a thing like that...

369
00:28:39,771 --> 00:28:41,871
unless I knew,
would I?

370
00:28:42,271 --> 00:28:44,172
Just let me
speak to her.

371
00:28:44,272 --> 00:28:46,173
Hello, beautiful.
Is that you?

372
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:48,473
Yeah,
we spoke yesterday.

373
00:28:49,374 --> 00:28:52,174
You have a glass of wine
with lunch?

374
00:28:52,374 --> 00:28:54,775
You sound
a little dusky. Hmm.

375
00:28:55,976 --> 00:28:58,176
Just a minute, sweetheart.

376
00:28:59,977 --> 00:29:01,777
You're back, huh?

377
00:29:03,578 --> 00:29:05,078
Tenacious!

378
00:29:05,178 --> 00:29:08,579
Get out my dress blues.
They're in a garment bag in the closet.

379
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,680
Check the top dresser drawer.
Take out the shoulder boards...

380
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:12,781
and affix them
shoulders right and left,

381
00:29:12,881 --> 00:29:15,081
A.S.A.P.
That means now.

382
00:29:15,582 --> 00:29:16,982
Hello.

383
00:29:17,582 --> 00:29:20,283
Sorry to keep you
waitin', sweetheart.

384
00:29:20,883 --> 00:29:23,384
I'm not the kind of guy
who likes to rush things,

385
00:29:23,484 --> 00:29:28,385
but I'm catchin' a 4:00
at Logan, lookin' out my window,
and there's not a taxi in sight.

386
00:29:29,286 --> 00:29:31,386
What happened to Chet?

387
00:29:31,686 --> 00:29:33,687
He didn't invest
in a radio yet?

388
00:29:33,787 --> 00:29:36,388
Hah! Well,
get your driver on it.

389
00:29:37,088 --> 00:29:39,389
Tell him to get
a move on.

390
00:29:40,789 --> 00:29:42,290
Yes. Mmm.

391
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:47,191
Some kind of body has got to go
with that bedroom voice.

392
00:29:47,991 --> 00:29:50,492
One day I'm gonna swing by,
get a better look at it.

393
00:29:50,592 --> 00:29:52,093
You bet.

394
00:29:53,293 --> 00:29:54,593
Bye.

395
00:29:58,295 --> 00:30:01,296
My val-pak's underneath the bed.
Get it out.

396
00:30:01,796 --> 00:30:03,896
Put the boards on the blues
and fold 'em in.

397
00:30:03,996 --> 00:30:06,697
Uh, are we going someplace,
Colonel?

398
00:30:07,597 --> 00:30:10,998
What business is that of yours?
Don't shrug, imbecile.

399
00:30:11,099 --> 00:30:14,299
I'm blind. Save your body language
for the bimbi.

400
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:19,401
- Now, get my gear out.
- Francine, get in the car.

401
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:24,703
It's almost 3:00. The goddamn
Flintstones haven't left yet.

402
00:30:25,403 --> 00:30:27,904
Willie Rossi must go in the car!

403
00:30:30,504 --> 00:30:33,405
- Here comes Mrs. Rossi now.
- Damn it!

404
00:30:34,306 --> 00:30:37,307
She said good-bye to me
three times today.

405
00:30:37,807 --> 00:30:39,907
What's she got,
separation anxiety?

406
00:30:40,007 --> 00:30:42,208
Cut her off
at the door!

407
00:30:44,409 --> 00:30:46,509
Hi, honey.
Bye, honey.

408
00:30:49,810 --> 00:30:52,211
I wish you were
coming with us.

409
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,712
Me too.

410
00:30:54,612 --> 00:30:56,412
Maybe next time.

411
00:31:00,914 --> 00:31:03,314
- Drive carefully now.
- Yeah.

412
00:31:04,615 --> 00:31:07,116
Charlie, this is
where we'll be.

413
00:31:08,916 --> 00:31:12,117
Good luck, Charlie.
Don't let him drink too much.

414
00:31:15,818 --> 00:31:17,619
See ya, Charlie!

415
00:31:18,219 --> 00:31:21,220
And no 900 numbers.
He loves to talk dirty.

416
00:31:28,922 --> 00:31:31,323
All right,
let's get to work.

417
00:31:40,826 --> 00:31:43,227
L-buckles
givin' you trouble?

418
00:31:44,827 --> 00:31:47,028
Never in the Boy Scouts,
sluggo?

419
00:31:47,128 --> 00:31:50,229
- I made Tenderfoot.
- Tenderfoot, my foot!

420
00:31:50,829 --> 00:31:53,130
Convenience-store
mama's boy.

421
00:31:53,230 --> 00:31:55,330
Here. Let me
take a look at that.

422
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:59,032
Touch me again, I'll kill ya,
you little son-of-a-bitch!

423
00:32:00,632 --> 00:32:02,833
I touch you.
Understand?

424
00:32:08,034 --> 00:32:11,835
My shoulder boards are in
the top dresser drawer. Get them, son.

425
00:32:12,136 --> 00:32:14,936
The epaulets with
the silver oak leaf.

426
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,542
- Are these...
- Good.

427
00:32:35,543 --> 00:32:37,243
Taxi come yet?

428
00:32:38,043 --> 00:32:40,444
Colonel,
where are we going?

429
00:32:40,544 --> 00:32:42,345
Where we going?

430
00:32:42,545 --> 00:32:44,445
Freak show central.

431
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:47,546
- Where's that?
- New York City.

432
00:32:49,747 --> 00:32:52,248
That's in New York, son.
New York State.

433
00:32:52,348 --> 00:32:56,149
Uh, Mrs. Rossi didn't say anything to me
about going anywhere.

434
00:32:56,749 --> 00:32:58,350
She forgot.

435
00:32:58,950 --> 00:33:02,051
- Should we call her, 'cause I...
- You kidding me?

436
00:33:02,151 --> 00:33:05,852
Call her? By the time they get to
Albany in that "hupmobile" he drives...

437
00:33:05,952 --> 00:33:08,553
it'll be opening day
at Saratoga.

438
00:33:08,753 --> 00:33:12,054
- Colonel, I can't go to New York City.
- Why not?

439
00:33:12,854 --> 00:33:14,455
New York...

440
00:33:14,955 --> 00:33:18,656
- New York's too much responsibility.
- Ah, responsibility!

441
00:33:18,756 --> 00:33:21,457
I had a lot of 17 year olds
my first platoon.

442
00:33:21,557 --> 00:33:23,957
I took care of them.
All set!

443
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:27,859
How do I look?

444
00:33:28,859 --> 00:33:30,660
Tickets. Money.

445
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:33,160
Speech.

446
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:36,961
Old Washington joke...
from my days with Lyndon.

447
00:33:37,462 --> 00:33:40,262
I knew I could count on transportation.

448
00:33:41,463 --> 00:33:43,163
Are you ready?

449
00:33:45,464 --> 00:33:48,565
This is not Panmunjom.
A simple yes will do.

450
00:33:48,965 --> 00:33:50,966
- Um...
- Good! Here you go.

451
00:33:51,066 --> 00:33:53,366
Come on!
Hup to it, son!

452
00:33:54,067 --> 00:33:56,567
You're in front of me.
Let's go.

453
00:33:56,767 --> 00:33:58,868
Tomster, come here, boy.

454
00:34:00,269 --> 00:34:02,269
Psst, psst.
Come on.

455
00:34:02,969 --> 00:34:06,070
Here, tomster, come on.
Tomster, tomster. Yeah.

456
00:34:08,271 --> 00:34:10,772
Remember, when in doubt... fuck.

457
00:34:16,373 --> 00:34:18,874
Good afternoon, sir.
Where's our destination?

458
00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:21,875
Our destination... New York City,
home of the brave!

459
00:34:21,975 --> 00:34:25,076
- Two for the shuttle to New York.
- I'm not shuttling anywhere.

460
00:34:25,176 --> 00:34:28,977
- Look at those tickets. "First class".
- Yes, sir, first class.

461
00:34:29,077 --> 00:34:32,578
You bought me a ticket?
I never said I'd go to New York.

462
00:34:32,979 --> 00:34:37,080
What are you, some kind of chicken-shit,
sticks to job description only?

463
00:34:37,180 --> 00:34:38,880
Gate 46, sir.

464
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,881
- As you were, son.
- Thank you, sir.

465
00:34:42,081 --> 00:34:44,082
Which way's the door?

466
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:47,883
- Are you blind? Are you blind?
- Of course not.

467
00:34:48,883 --> 00:34:51,884
Then why do you keep grabbin'
my goddamn arm?

468
00:34:52,184 --> 00:34:53,985
I take your arm.

469
00:34:58,886 --> 00:35:00,887
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry.

470
00:35:00,987 --> 00:35:04,088
How would you know,
watchin' MTV all your life?

471
00:35:04,188 --> 00:35:05,488
Yes!

472
00:35:07,989 --> 00:35:10,290
- Jack Daniels...
- You bet.

473
00:35:12,391 --> 00:35:15,191
and Diet Slice.
- The old Diet Slice.

474
00:35:15,692 --> 00:35:17,992
- And a water.
- Thank you, Daphne.

475
00:35:18,092 --> 00:35:19,793
Certainly, sir.

476
00:35:24,994 --> 00:35:26,595
Ahh! Mmm!

477
00:35:27,095 --> 00:35:29,396
How did you know her name?

478
00:35:30,996 --> 00:35:33,297
Well, she's
wearin' Floris.

479
00:35:34,397 --> 00:35:36,698
That's an
English cologne.

480
00:35:37,698 --> 00:35:40,399
But her voice is
California chickie.

481
00:35:41,900 --> 00:35:45,201
Now, California chickie
bucking for English lady...

482
00:35:45,801 --> 00:35:47,701
I call her Daphne.

483
00:35:49,502 --> 00:35:53,103
Oh, big things may happen to
that little thing of yours.

484
00:35:55,504 --> 00:35:57,204
Look, Colonel,

485
00:35:58,405 --> 00:36:00,705
- I'll get you to New York, all right?
- Uh-huh.

486
00:36:00,805 --> 00:36:04,006
Then I'm gonna have
to turn around and come back.

487
00:36:04,206 --> 00:36:07,207
Well, Chuck, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

488
00:36:07,407 --> 00:36:09,908
Charlie, all right?
Or Charles.

489
00:36:10,608 --> 00:36:12,809
Sorry.
I can't blame you, though.

490
00:36:12,909 --> 00:36:14,610
Chuck is a...

491
00:36:17,310 --> 00:36:19,911
So, why are we
going to New York?

492
00:36:20,111 --> 00:36:23,512
All information will be given
on a need-to-know basis.

493
00:36:25,513 --> 00:36:27,013
Whoo-ah!

494
00:36:27,514 --> 00:36:30,414
Where's Daphne?
Let's get her down here.

495
00:36:32,015 --> 00:36:33,815
She's in the back.

496
00:36:34,016 --> 00:36:36,016
A tail's in the tail.

497
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:39,017
Hah!

498
00:36:39,717 --> 00:36:41,918
Oh, but I still smell her.

499
00:36:45,119 --> 00:36:46,619
Women!

500
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:49,620
What can you say?

501
00:36:50,921 --> 00:36:52,621
Who made 'em?

502
00:36:53,622 --> 00:36:56,222
God must have been
a fuckin' genius.

503
00:37:00,524 --> 00:37:02,124
The hair...

504
00:37:03,224 --> 00:37:06,125
They say the hair
is everything, you know.

505
00:37:07,426 --> 00:37:10,927
Have you ever buried your nose
in a mountain of curls...

506
00:37:11,527 --> 00:37:14,428
and just wanted
to go to sleep forever?

507
00:37:16,529 --> 00:37:18,029
Or lips...

508
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,330
and when they touched,
yours were like...

509
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:24,831
that first swallow
of wine...

510
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:28,832
after you just crossed
the desert.

511
00:37:32,133 --> 00:37:33,934
Tits! Whoo-ah!

512
00:37:35,834 --> 00:37:37,835
Big ones, little ones,

513
00:37:39,235 --> 00:37:41,636
nipples staring
right out at ya...

514
00:37:41,736 --> 00:37:43,937
Iike secret searchlights.

515
00:37:44,737 --> 00:37:46,038
Mmm.

516
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:50,139
And legs...

517
00:37:51,439 --> 00:37:54,240
I don't care if
they're Greek columns...

518
00:37:54,740 --> 00:37:56,841
or secondhand Steinways.

519
00:37:58,241 --> 00:38:00,142
What's between 'em,

520
00:38:01,742 --> 00:38:03,643
passport to heaven.

521
00:38:05,043 --> 00:38:06,744
I need a drink.

522
00:38:10,745 --> 00:38:12,546
Yes, Mr. Simms,

523
00:38:14,146 --> 00:38:18,047
there's only two syllables
in this whole wide world worth hearing:

524
00:38:23,049 --> 00:38:24,349
pussy.

525
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,150
Hah!

526
00:38:27,750 --> 00:38:31,351
Are you listening to me, son?
I'm givin' you pearls here.

527
00:38:32,452 --> 00:38:34,752
I guess you
really like women.

528
00:38:34,852 --> 00:38:36,853
Oh, above all things!

529
00:38:43,355 --> 00:38:45,756
A very, very
distant second...

530
00:38:48,757 --> 00:38:50,457
is a Ferrari.

531
00:38:57,960 --> 00:38:59,460
Charlie?

532
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:02,861
Give me your hand.

533
00:39:05,362 --> 00:39:08,463
This is just the start
of your education, son.

534
00:39:24,268 --> 00:39:25,768
Whoo-ah!

535
00:39:26,368 --> 00:39:29,069
- Where are we?
- Where are we, eh?

536
00:39:29,369 --> 00:39:32,170
The cynosure of
all things civilized:

537
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,771
the Waldorf-Astoria.

538
00:39:34,971 --> 00:39:38,772
The last time I was here, Charlie,
was with a G-2 from Brussels.

539
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:41,173
Had a Ferrari.

540
00:39:41,473 --> 00:39:44,474
Every day I held the door
open for the fucker.

541
00:39:44,674 --> 00:39:46,674
Never even offered me
a ride.

542
00:39:46,774 --> 00:39:48,475
Well, fuck him.

543
00:39:48,775 --> 00:39:50,876
He's dead and I'm blind.

544
00:39:52,676 --> 00:39:54,977
- Spread the word.
- Thank you, sir.

545
00:39:55,077 --> 00:39:58,178
- The intelligence will be forthcoming?
- Sir?

546
00:39:58,678 --> 00:40:00,679
On the escort scene.

547
00:40:00,779 --> 00:40:02,379
Um, yes, sir.

548
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:06,480
- And welcome to the Waldorf.
- Gracias, amigo.

549
00:40:08,381 --> 00:40:11,582
Puerto Ricans...
always made the best infantrymen.

550
00:40:18,384 --> 00:40:19,685
Oh!

551
00:40:29,388 --> 00:40:31,188
I'm home again.

552
00:40:31,788 --> 00:40:34,589
Give me an inventory
on this, will you?

553
00:40:40,091 --> 00:40:42,391
All right,
where am I, in Asia?

554
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:46,293
He told me the phone was on
the other side of the room, didn't he?

555
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:48,193
By the windows?

556
00:40:49,094 --> 00:40:50,894
It's right here.

557
00:40:52,194 --> 00:40:53,495
Okay.

558
00:40:54,295 --> 00:40:56,196
We're in business.

559
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:02,498
Get me the Oak Room.

560
00:41:02,798 --> 00:41:05,198
How's that inventory
comin'?

561
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:09,600
Uh, there's Jim Beam
and Early Times.

562
00:41:12,001 --> 00:41:14,901
Quartermaster's on the take again.
Hello.

563
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:17,202
Is Sheldon or Mack there?

564
00:41:19,003 --> 00:41:21,403
This is
Lt. Col. Frank Slade.

565
00:41:21,503 --> 00:41:25,405
I used to be a regular. I used
to come in with a General Garbisch.

566
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:30,706
Yes, that's probably because
he's at Arlington six feet under.

567
00:41:30,806 --> 00:41:34,707
Listen up. I want a table for two, and
I don't mean Siberia, 8:15.

568
00:41:36,608 --> 00:41:39,009
Clear them little
bottles off.

569
00:41:39,209 --> 00:41:42,210
And when I get off the phone,
call up Hyman.

570
00:41:42,410 --> 00:41:45,311
Tell him I want it
wall to wall with John Daniels.

571
00:41:45,411 --> 00:41:48,212
Uh, don't you mean,
uh, Jack Daniels?

572
00:41:48,712 --> 00:41:52,413
He may be Jack to you, son. But when
you've known him as long as I have...

573
00:41:52,513 --> 00:41:54,013
That's a joke.
Hello!

574
00:41:54,113 --> 00:41:57,614
This is Lt. Col. Frank Slade.
I would like a limo, 8:00.

575
00:42:04,517 --> 00:42:06,617
What are you drinkin'?

576
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,418
Uh, nothing, thanks.
I don't use it.

577
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:12,619
What's useful about it?

578
00:42:13,519 --> 00:42:16,820
I don't know. Listen, Colonel,
I have to get going.

579
00:42:17,421 --> 00:42:19,221
Where you goin'?

580
00:42:19,521 --> 00:42:23,822
Back to school. I've got some real
important stuff I have to take care of.

581
00:42:25,023 --> 00:42:26,523
Very well.

582
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:30,725
But I never let my aides leave
on an empty stomach.

583
00:42:30,825 --> 00:42:33,826
You'll dine with me and then my driver
will transport you...

584
00:42:33,926 --> 00:42:37,727
to the airport for the Boston Shuttle
departing at 2200 hours.

585
00:42:39,027 --> 00:42:41,228
Meanwhile,
unpack my bag.

586
00:42:42,428 --> 00:42:44,929
I'm gonna christen
the latrine.

587
00:42:46,029 --> 00:42:48,230
What's your name, driver?

588
00:42:48,330 --> 00:42:50,431
- Manny, sir.
- Manny.

589
00:42:51,031 --> 00:42:54,632
The bellhops at the Waldorf, are they
any good at getting escorts?

590
00:42:54,732 --> 00:42:57,933
- I wouldn't know, sir.
- What would you know?

591
00:42:58,433 --> 00:43:01,234
- About what?
- About you-know-what?

592
00:43:03,535 --> 00:43:05,935
Maybe I could
manage something.

593
00:43:06,035 --> 00:43:08,536
I'm talkin' top of the line, now.

594
00:43:09,236 --> 00:43:11,537
Let me think
about this, sir.

595
00:43:19,139 --> 00:43:21,140
What's the matter
with you?

596
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:24,541
- With me?
- Yeah. Car feels heavy. You know why?

597
00:43:26,142 --> 00:43:29,643
You got the fuckin' weight of the world
on your shoulders.

598
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:35,844
I got a little problem
at school, that's all.

599
00:43:35,945 --> 00:43:38,845
- Spit it out!
- It's not a big deal, all right?

600
00:43:38,945 --> 00:43:40,846
Where we going,
the Oak Room or somethin'?

601
00:43:40,946 --> 00:43:43,547
If it's not a big deal, why did you say
"real important stuff"?

602
00:43:43,647 --> 00:43:47,148
What are you doin', banging
the dean's daughter? Hah!

603
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:52,850
- I'm just in a little trouble.
- What kind of trouble?

604
00:43:53,250 --> 00:43:55,751
I saw some guys
doing something.

605
00:43:57,751 --> 00:44:00,652
To tell or not to tell,
or it's your ass.

606
00:44:01,252 --> 00:44:02,553
Hmm?

607
00:44:05,253 --> 00:44:07,354
- How'd you know that?
- I'm a wizard.

608
00:44:07,454 --> 00:44:09,855
Give me the details,
come on.

609
00:44:15,557 --> 00:44:17,657
There's this guy
at school named Harry.

610
00:44:17,757 --> 00:44:19,758
He's this real rich kid.

611
00:44:19,858 --> 00:44:22,059
He like...
runs the show.

612
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,659
Who else?

613
00:44:24,859 --> 00:44:28,461
There's another guy, George,
but George didn't do anything.

614
00:44:29,161 --> 00:44:32,562
George and I saw Harry and his buddies
doin' somethin'.

615
00:44:33,062 --> 00:44:35,163
Now, the folks at Baird,

616
00:44:35,263 --> 00:44:38,864
they know you and George can
identify the guilty parties?

617
00:44:41,264 --> 00:44:43,365
Yeah, they think we can.

618
00:44:43,465 --> 00:44:47,566
- George is a friend of yours.
- He's not a friend, but he's all right.

619
00:44:48,267 --> 00:44:50,967
- You trust him?
- Yeah, I guess so.

620
00:44:51,968 --> 00:44:54,769
- He's on scholarship too?
- No, why?

621
00:44:56,969 --> 00:44:59,970
We got George, we got Harry,
we got trouble.

622
00:45:00,470 --> 00:45:03,171
They're rich, you're poor.
You wanna get rich.

623
00:45:03,271 --> 00:45:06,672
You wanna graduate Baird,
become a rich big shot like them.

624
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:09,873
- Am I right?
- No. It's not that way at all.

625
00:45:09,973 --> 00:45:11,674
Okay, Charlie!

626
00:45:14,075 --> 00:45:16,475
Here we are, gentlemen:
the Oak Room.

627
00:45:16,575 --> 00:45:18,376
The Oak Room!

628
00:45:19,076 --> 00:45:22,077
Bring us a menu and double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

629
00:45:22,177 --> 00:45:24,078
Charlie, sit down here.

630
00:45:24,178 --> 00:45:27,679
Uh, perhaps you'll feel more
comfortable in this, sir.

631
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:34,081
You look great!

632
00:45:40,182 --> 00:45:41,683
Thank you.

633
00:45:42,783 --> 00:45:45,384
Here we are, Charlie:
the Oak Room.

634
00:45:45,984 --> 00:45:48,385
Now, read me
the bill of fare.

635
00:45:49,285 --> 00:45:50,986
Uh, let's see.

636
00:45:51,886 --> 00:45:54,887
You got the Oak Room Burger
and fries for $24.

637
00:45:54,987 --> 00:45:58,188
Where's the booze?
Flowin' like mud around here.

638
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,189
A $24 hamburger?

639
00:46:00,389 --> 00:46:02,389
W-What's the story?

640
00:46:02,689 --> 00:46:04,290
What story?

641
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:08,591
- Are you a rich miser or something?
- Hah!

642
00:46:09,391 --> 00:46:11,892
No, I'm just your average
blind man.

643
00:46:11,992 --> 00:46:14,093
Your average blind man.

644
00:46:14,693 --> 00:46:17,794
How do you plan on
paying for all this stuff?

645
00:46:17,994 --> 00:46:20,495
Crisp, clean dollars...
American.

646
00:46:21,495 --> 00:46:23,396
I saved up my
disability checks.

647
00:46:23,496 --> 00:46:26,597
How much did you save?
I mean, we flew first class,

648
00:46:26,697 --> 00:46:29,998
we're at the Waldorf-Astoria,
a $24 hamburger restaurant.

649
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:33,899
- All part of a plan, Charlie.
- You want to let me in on it?

650
00:46:34,099 --> 00:46:36,700
Why should I? You're not interested.
You don't give a shit!

651
00:46:36,800 --> 00:46:40,201
You're leavin' on that
last shuttle out of La Guardia.

652
00:46:41,201 --> 00:46:42,802
Hmm? Ooh!

653
00:46:44,902 --> 00:46:47,503
You got 15 minutes, son. I don't think
you're gonna make it,

654
00:46:47,603 --> 00:46:51,604
unless the Oak Room keeps some
complimentary helicopter on the roof.

655
00:46:53,105 --> 00:46:54,705
No, sir. No!

656
00:46:55,906 --> 00:46:58,106
You're here till tomorrow.

657
00:46:59,407 --> 00:47:01,507
You said the last shuttle
leaves at 2200 hours.

658
00:47:01,607 --> 00:47:03,508
That's 10:00, right?

659
00:47:03,608 --> 00:47:05,509
Last I heard, yeah.

660
00:47:06,109 --> 00:47:07,809
It's only 8:30.

661
00:47:08,409 --> 00:47:10,510
I lied. Leaves at 9:00.

662
00:47:10,910 --> 00:47:14,011
- It leaves at 9:00?
- Calm down. Calm down.

663
00:47:17,112 --> 00:47:19,413
Ahh! The truth is, Charlie,

664
00:47:22,114 --> 00:47:25,915
- I need a guide dog
to help me execute my plan.
- What plan?

665
00:47:28,216 --> 00:47:30,316
You have a right to know.

666
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,718
It's not really a plan, Charlie.
It's sort of a...

667
00:47:35,818 --> 00:47:37,618
more like a tour,

668
00:47:38,519 --> 00:47:40,719
a little tour of pleasures:

669
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,821
stay in a first-class hotel,
eat an agreeable meal,

670
00:47:46,121 --> 00:47:48,422
drink a nice glass of wine,

671
00:47:49,322 --> 00:47:51,223
see my big brother.

672
00:47:51,623 --> 00:47:54,023
Nothing like family,
you know.

673
00:47:54,323 --> 00:47:57,124
And then, make love
to a terrific woman.

674
00:48:00,125 --> 00:48:01,826
After that...

675
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:08,628
Yeah?

676
00:48:11,729 --> 00:48:15,530
I'm gonna lie down on my big,
beautiful bed at the Waldorf...

677
00:48:16,330 --> 00:48:18,431
and blow my brains out.

678
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:25,033
- May I tell you our specials?
- You may, sir.

679
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:29,534
Tonight we have charred venison with
buckwheat spaetzle and green peppercorn.

680
00:48:30,034 --> 00:48:33,435
Grilled veal, tomato tapenade,
and roasted eggplants.

681
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:35,636
Get me a napkin.
My mouth's watering.

682
00:48:35,736 --> 00:48:39,837
If you like our souffle for dessert,
it would be good to order it now.

683
00:48:41,138 --> 00:48:44,039
Yes, on the souffle. Give us
a haIf a minute on the rest.

684
00:48:44,139 --> 00:48:45,939
Very good, sir.

685
00:48:50,041 --> 00:48:53,442
- I'm leaning towards the spaetzle.
- Colonel Slade...

686
00:48:53,942 --> 00:48:56,843
Charlie, rolls on the table?
Give 'em to me.

687
00:48:56,943 --> 00:48:58,943
You should
try these rolls.

688
00:48:59,043 --> 00:49:02,444
I used to dream about them
when I was at Fort Huachuca.

689
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:05,545
- Colonel Slade...
- Bread's no good west of the Colorado.

690
00:49:05,645 --> 00:49:09,146
- Water's too alkaline.
- Colonel Slade, did you say...

691
00:49:10,147 --> 00:49:12,247
Did I hear you right?

692
00:49:13,848 --> 00:49:15,648
You said you're gonna
kill yourseIf?

693
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:18,649
No, I said I was gonna
blow my brains out.

694
00:49:21,050 --> 00:49:24,451
Try one of these rolls, Charlie.
I buttered it for ya.

695
00:49:24,651 --> 00:49:26,952
I don't want a roll,
all right?

696
00:49:27,052 --> 00:49:28,852
Okay. Have a radish!

697
00:49:28,952 --> 00:49:30,353
Hah!

698
00:49:32,253 --> 00:49:35,554
Hello! Bring me a double
Jack Daniels on the rocks.

699
00:49:36,855 --> 00:49:38,955
Yes, sir.
Right away.

700
00:49:43,157 --> 00:49:45,157
Please, don't do that.

701
00:49:45,758 --> 00:49:47,558
Don't do that.

702
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:55,160
Hmm.

703
00:49:58,361 --> 00:50:00,462
What a marvelous place!

704
00:50:04,063 --> 00:50:05,364
Okay.

705
00:50:08,965 --> 00:50:10,365
Yeah.

706
00:50:12,266 --> 00:50:14,166
Your billet is here.

707
00:50:14,366 --> 00:50:17,467
You'll find bedding
in the closet on the shelf.

708
00:50:18,568 --> 00:50:22,469
In the morning, the area will be
returned to sitting-room mode...

709
00:50:23,369 --> 00:50:25,570
no later than
7 hours.

710
00:50:28,371 --> 00:50:30,071
What was that?

711
00:50:33,772 --> 00:50:35,173
Nothing.

712
00:50:36,173 --> 00:50:38,474
Next time...
snap it out!

713
00:50:41,475 --> 00:50:45,376
Thumb to palm, index finger
through little digit, smartly aligned,

714
00:50:46,976 --> 00:50:49,377
sharp to the hairline,
down!

715
00:50:54,278 --> 00:50:56,579
Too many men,
far better than you,

716
00:50:56,679 --> 00:50:58,980
have executed
that courtesy.

717
00:50:59,380 --> 00:51:02,381
And if you're smart,
you won't try it again.

718
00:51:06,482 --> 00:51:09,683
This bat has got sharper radar
than the Nautilus.

719
00:51:11,584 --> 00:51:13,884
Don't fuck with me,
Charlie.

720
00:51:24,588 --> 00:51:27,289
See you get
a good night's sleep, son.

721
00:51:39,592 --> 00:51:41,693
It's a lovely day today

722
00:51:42,293 --> 00:51:44,494
So, whatever you gotta do

723
00:51:45,394 --> 00:51:48,395
You got a lovely day
to do it in that's true

724
00:51:54,597 --> 00:51:56,698
Good morning, Charlie.

725
00:51:59,498 --> 00:52:02,399
- Good morning.
- This is Sofia, Charlie.

726
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:05,600
She's a magician
with a needle.

727
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:08,701
Sofia's workin' me up
a little "Glen Plaid" number,

728
00:52:08,801 --> 00:52:11,402
and I've asked her if she'd
put something together for you.

729
00:52:11,502 --> 00:52:15,103
- Uh, I don't need any clothes, Colonel.
- Standard issue...

730
00:52:15,203 --> 00:52:17,704
for an upscale
urban assignment.

731
00:52:17,904 --> 00:52:20,505
You don't like the clothes,
Charlie, on completion of duty,

732
00:52:20,605 --> 00:52:22,706
you can give 'em away.

733
00:52:22,906 --> 00:52:26,207
Juice, coffee, and other assorted
goodies on the trolley over there.

734
00:52:26,307 --> 00:52:28,507
Get yourseIf up,
get yourseIf together!

735
00:52:28,607 --> 00:52:31,208
It's a great day
for singin' a song

736
00:52:32,208 --> 00:52:34,909
And it's a great day
for movin' along

737
00:52:36,110 --> 00:52:38,710
And it's a great day
from morning to night

738
00:52:38,810 --> 00:52:40,711
And it's a great day

739
00:52:42,412 --> 00:52:44,412
For everybody's plight

740
00:52:50,014 --> 00:52:52,115
How are you feeling
today, Colonel?

741
00:52:52,215 --> 00:52:54,115
Super!
Superior!

742
00:52:55,516 --> 00:52:57,216
Superfluous!

743
00:52:58,416 --> 00:53:00,517
Young Sofie here
is working Thanksgiving...

744
00:53:00,617 --> 00:53:02,818
because she's trying to
put herseIf through college.

745
00:53:02,918 --> 00:53:06,419
I told her, "My young friend
Charlie's headed for college".

746
00:53:06,519 --> 00:53:09,120
- Uh, excuse me.
- Where you goin'?

747
00:53:09,220 --> 00:53:12,821
- I need to use the phone.
- What's wrong with the phones in here?

748
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:15,222
I don't want
to disturb you.

749
00:53:15,622 --> 00:53:17,522
You're not disturbing me.
Make your call.

750
00:53:17,622 --> 00:53:19,823
I'd kinda like
to be private.

751
00:53:19,923 --> 00:53:21,924
Stay outta my room!

752
00:53:22,924 --> 00:53:25,725
This is as private
as you're gonna get.

753
00:53:28,326 --> 00:53:31,427
But if you've got somethin'
that must be done

754
00:53:33,127 --> 00:53:35,528
And it can only be done by one

755
00:53:38,329 --> 00:53:39,729
Sofia...

756
00:53:41,129 --> 00:53:44,330
what are the chances
of suitin' you up sometime?

757
00:53:44,831 --> 00:53:47,732
- Sugarbush Lodge.
- George Willis, please.

758
00:53:50,732 --> 00:53:53,533
- Hello!
- George! Hey, it's Charlie.

759
00:53:54,234 --> 00:53:57,334
Hey, Chas. Next year you gotta
come up with us.

760
00:53:57,434 --> 00:54:00,235
White powder on
a base of snow bunnies.

761
00:54:02,636 --> 00:54:04,637
Chas,
are you there?

762
00:54:05,337 --> 00:54:07,338
Yeah, I'm here.
Um...

763
00:54:07,638 --> 00:54:10,739
you told me to call you for the moves.
- All right.

764
00:54:10,839 --> 00:54:13,539
For now, the move's
no move: status quo.

765
00:54:13,639 --> 00:54:15,540
Everything's
the way we left it.

766
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:17,641
How did we leave it?

767
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:20,542
See no evil,
hear no evil.

768
00:54:22,042 --> 00:54:24,443
You know
what I mean, Chas?

769
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:28,244
Yeah. See no evil,
hear no evil.

770
00:54:30,845 --> 00:54:34,346
- Okay, then, walk like you talk!
- All right, good-bye.

771
00:54:36,146 --> 00:54:38,647
- George Willis, huh?
- Yeah.

772
00:54:41,248 --> 00:54:42,948
George Willis.

773
00:54:43,248 --> 00:54:46,650
That makes his father probably
George Willis, Senior.

774
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:49,150
Charlie, I ask ya,

775
00:54:49,250 --> 00:54:53,152
what do you think Big George
is gonna feel about Little George...

776
00:54:53,252 --> 00:54:55,752
seeing no evil,
hearing no evil?

777
00:54:58,853 --> 00:55:00,954
Well, we're not gonna
tell our parents.

778
00:55:01,054 --> 00:55:03,955
We're just gonna keep it
between ourselves.

779
00:55:04,055 --> 00:55:07,556
Oh, George isn't gonna tell
his father about this thing!

780
00:55:08,356 --> 00:55:10,957
Damn decent of him.
Ooh! Aw! Hah!

781
00:55:11,257 --> 00:55:13,158
- Scusi.
- Prego.

782
00:55:13,658 --> 00:55:15,858
I love it
when you hurt me.

783
00:55:16,059 --> 00:55:18,259
Uh, tell me now,
Charlie.

784
00:55:18,659 --> 00:55:22,060
This, uh, George Willis, Junior,
what's his father do?

785
00:55:22,661 --> 00:55:24,661
I don't really know.

786
00:55:24,761 --> 00:55:26,962
Well, I'm gonna tell ya.

787
00:55:27,462 --> 00:55:31,963
When George Willis, Sr., isn't busy as a
million-dollar man for Aetna Casualty...

788
00:55:32,263 --> 00:55:35,665
or is it New England Distributor
for the Chrysler Corporation?

789
00:55:35,765 --> 00:55:39,566
He concerns himseIf with his young son,
George Willis, Junior.

790
00:55:39,866 --> 00:55:43,067
George isn't going
to say anything to his father.

791
00:55:43,267 --> 00:55:44,867
Oh, Charlie.

792
00:55:45,568 --> 00:55:47,768
Big George is gonna
wind up Little George,

793
00:55:47,868 --> 00:55:50,969
and Little George is gonna sing
like a canary.

794
00:55:51,069 --> 00:55:53,570
And if you're hip, kid,
you're gonna hop to, too.

795
00:55:53,670 --> 00:55:55,771
You've got this
all figured out, don't you?

796
00:55:55,871 --> 00:55:59,972
It don't take no Young America merit
scholarship to figure this one out.

797
00:56:00,272 --> 00:56:04,173
Charlie, you had a little life,
so you decided to go to Baird...

798
00:56:04,273 --> 00:56:07,274
to put yourseIf in the market
for a big one.

799
00:56:07,374 --> 00:56:09,375
Now, in order to stay
in the running,

800
00:56:09,475 --> 00:56:12,276
you're gonna have to tell these people
what they want to know.

801
00:56:12,376 --> 00:56:14,076
You think so?

802
00:56:14,676 --> 00:56:16,577
- Are we finished, Sofia?
- Yes.

803
00:56:16,677 --> 00:56:18,378
Grazie. Grazie.

804
00:56:21,278 --> 00:56:22,779
Charlie,

805
00:56:23,979 --> 00:56:25,980
if you don't sing now,

806
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:30,081
you're gonna end up,
not only shelving biscuits...

807
00:56:30,281 --> 00:56:33,282
in some convenience store
in the Oregon burbs,

808
00:56:33,382 --> 00:56:37,483
probably the last word you'll ever hear
yourseIf say just before you croak...

809
00:56:37,583 --> 00:56:40,684
gonna be, "Have a nice day
and come back soon".

810
00:56:41,685 --> 00:56:43,085
Sofia!

811
00:56:43,885 --> 00:56:47,486
Measure up Charlie, pronto.
We got a date for Thanksgiving.

812
00:56:47,987 --> 00:56:49,687
We got a date?

813
00:56:49,987 --> 00:56:51,988
My brother's place.

814
00:56:52,288 --> 00:56:54,889
W.R. Slade,
White Plains, New York.

815
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:58,490
Colonel, I can't go with you
to your brother's place.

816
00:56:58,690 --> 00:57:01,591
I mean, I should be
getting back to school.

817
00:57:03,791 --> 00:57:06,992
Uh, well you gotta have
Thanksgiving somewhere.

818
00:57:08,393 --> 00:57:11,594
I mean, eats and treats.
I could use the company.

819
00:57:15,795 --> 00:57:18,496
All right.
D-Does he know I'm comin'?

820
00:57:18,796 --> 00:57:21,697
He doesn't know I'm comin'. But wait
till you see the look on his face...

821
00:57:21,797 --> 00:57:23,698
when I walk through
the door.

822
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:25,598
Oh, he loves me!

823
00:57:27,799 --> 00:57:30,700
Oh, uh, Charlie,
about your little problem,

824
00:57:31,700 --> 00:57:34,201
there are two kinds of people
in this world:

825
00:57:34,301 --> 00:57:36,702
those who stand up
and face the music,

826
00:57:36,802 --> 00:57:38,702
and those who
run for cover.

827
00:57:38,802 --> 00:57:41,803
Cover's better.
Okay, Sofia, suit 'im up!

828
00:57:42,503 --> 00:57:44,304
Make him pretty!

829
00:57:59,208 --> 00:58:00,609
Careful.

830
00:58:02,209 --> 00:58:04,510
- Should I ring it?
- Yeah.

831
00:58:11,612 --> 00:58:12,913
Yes?

832
00:58:13,713 --> 00:58:15,713
Yes!
Who is this?

833
00:58:16,314 --> 00:58:18,814
- It's Randy.
- Randy? You new?

834
00:58:20,715 --> 00:58:22,516
I'm your nephew.

835
00:58:22,916 --> 00:58:24,816
Hah!
Here I am!

836
00:58:25,716 --> 00:58:27,217
Your sister's been
hoarding me long enough.

837
00:58:27,317 --> 00:58:31,118
- Thought it's time to spread
the riches around.
- Uncle Frank!

838
00:58:31,918 --> 00:58:33,819
- Gloria!
- Gail.

839
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:35,519
Of course.

840
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:39,221
Say hello to the potluck
party from New York City.

841
00:58:39,521 --> 00:58:42,522
Good old Uncle Frank and this here
with him is Charlie Simms,

842
00:58:42,622 --> 00:58:44,922
star halfback of the
Baird football team.

843
00:58:45,022 --> 00:58:48,924
They not only beat Exeter and Groton,
but Aquinas High School too.

844
00:58:49,324 --> 00:58:51,724
Where's your
miserable father?

845
00:58:51,924 --> 00:58:54,425
Wait! No, no.
Let's surprise him.

846
00:58:54,525 --> 00:58:57,626
Give that fat heart
of his an attack. Willie!

847
00:58:59,927 --> 00:59:01,527
Oh, Willie!

848
00:59:13,131 --> 00:59:14,831
Hello, Frank.

849
00:59:15,132 --> 00:59:17,432
- How you doin'?
- Okay.

850
00:59:18,633 --> 00:59:21,534
Here's my hand.
Charlie, meet W.R. Slade.

851
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:25,535
Nice to meet you, sir.

852
00:59:25,735 --> 00:59:28,336
The original bulging
briefcase man.

853
00:59:28,636 --> 00:59:32,337
Gretchen, I smell those prunes!
We talkin' Turkey Marbella?

854
00:59:33,137 --> 00:59:35,238
- Yes, we are.
- Whoo!

855
00:59:35,938 --> 00:59:38,239
Let's have a whiff.
Come on.

856
00:59:38,739 --> 00:59:40,639
You know, I always had a sneaker
for you. Come here.

857
00:59:40,739 --> 00:59:42,040
Mmm.

858
00:59:42,940 --> 00:59:44,341
Hah!

859
00:59:44,941 --> 00:59:48,842
- Where are you, Garry?
I heard you cough.
- Who are you again?

860
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:53,143
I'm just here at the Waldorf-Astoria
with... Is it your brother?

861
00:59:53,943 --> 00:59:56,344
W.R.'s final issue.
How ya doin'?

862
00:59:56,444 --> 01:00:00,946
- Yes. Who the hell are you?
- I'm kinda takin' care
of him for the weekend.

863
01:00:01,646 --> 01:00:02,746
Charlie!

864
01:00:02,846 --> 01:00:04,247
Jesus!

865
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:08,348
Sorry. Where's the booze?
Flowin' like mud here.

866
01:00:09,748 --> 01:00:13,249
To tell the truth, the colonel's
not well, I don't think.

867
01:00:14,050 --> 01:00:17,051
- Not well?
- I think he's a little lonely.

868
01:00:17,251 --> 01:00:20,151
Why didn't you take him
to your family's for dinner?

869
01:00:20,251 --> 01:00:21,952
I heard that!

870
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:24,553
I heard that.

871
01:00:25,353 --> 01:00:27,954
Pay no attention to him.
That's his big-brother talk.

872
01:00:28,054 --> 01:00:30,755
He's been watching out for me
since day one.

873
01:00:30,855 --> 01:00:34,456
Bailed me out of more trouble...
than he'd like to remember.

874
01:00:35,456 --> 01:00:37,957
- Hmm?
- Let me take your coat.

875
01:00:38,057 --> 01:00:41,458
I meant to pick up some vino
on my way, but I blew it.

876
01:00:42,558 --> 01:00:45,059
I'll send you the Rothschild
again for Christmas,

877
01:00:45,159 --> 01:00:49,060
- only let's see how Thanksgiving goes.
- I'll set two more places.

878
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:52,261
- Here's your drink, Frank.
- Thank you, Randy.

879
01:00:52,461 --> 01:00:54,862
Still with
Snow Queen sugar?

880
01:00:55,162 --> 01:00:58,263
Snow Flake. Why do you
always get that wrong?

881
01:00:59,063 --> 01:01:02,364
Because it's not important for me to
get it right. What are you doing there?

882
01:01:02,464 --> 01:01:05,065
I'm Vice President
for Marketing.

883
01:01:05,865 --> 01:01:09,066
Whoo-ah! Congratulations!
Sugar is shit, though.

884
01:01:09,867 --> 01:01:13,268
I told General Abrams to install
honey in the commissaries.

885
01:01:13,368 --> 01:01:17,569
If the K-50s didn't blow your brains
out, sugar, sure as shit, was gonna.

886
01:01:18,269 --> 01:01:20,570
- Why don't we all sit down?
- Ooh!

887
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,571
Mitsouki. Rhymes with nookie.
Be careful.

888
01:01:24,671 --> 01:01:28,572
- When the wife gets restless,
the wife gets racy.
- Let's go and eat.

889
01:01:28,672 --> 01:01:31,273
By all means.
Thank you, Charlie.

890
01:01:33,674 --> 01:01:37,875
Where you wanna sit, Frank, or you gonna
arrange yourseIf at the head again?

891
01:01:37,975 --> 01:01:40,776
Any old card table
will do. This is fine.

892
01:01:42,277 --> 01:01:44,177
Where was I? Oh!

893
01:01:45,578 --> 01:01:48,979
I wake up. It's four in the morning.
I don't know who I'm with,

894
01:01:49,079 --> 01:01:51,279
why I'm there
and where I am.

895
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:54,280
What am I gonna do?
I got this Asian flower,

896
01:01:54,380 --> 01:01:56,581
all giggly and dewy-like;

897
01:01:58,982 --> 01:02:02,583
and this hard-boiled
navy nurse outta Omaha, on the other.

898
01:02:02,883 --> 01:02:06,384
We're three across the bed,
not a stitch of clothes on.

899
01:02:07,284 --> 01:02:08,985
It comes to me.

900
01:02:09,785 --> 01:02:12,886
Let east meet west.
We'll build a golden bridge.

901
01:02:14,386 --> 01:02:15,887
Hah-hah!

902
01:02:16,287 --> 01:02:19,588
I felt like I'd just joined
the corps of engineers!

903
01:02:23,789 --> 01:02:25,690
We all still here?

904
01:02:26,590 --> 01:02:28,591
It's a beautiful story.

905
01:02:32,192 --> 01:02:35,893
- Do you always enjoy
shocking people, Uncle Frank?
- Honey.

906
01:02:37,894 --> 01:02:40,094
I didn't know you were
so easily shocked.

907
01:02:40,194 --> 01:02:42,795
I admire your sensibilities.
I'm touched.

908
01:02:42,895 --> 01:02:45,896
Dad, remember the time
you persuaded Frank...

909
01:02:45,996 --> 01:02:48,797
- to go to the kennel?
- What about it?

910
01:02:49,397 --> 01:02:52,698
- He almost put the seeing eye
dog business outta business.
- Cool it, Randy.

911
01:02:52,798 --> 01:02:55,999
- It's over and done with.
- Indeed it is, Garry.

912
01:02:56,999 --> 01:02:59,300
Indeed it is.
So is dinner.

913
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:02,501
Charlie, what time do you have?
I think we better be gettin' back.

914
01:03:02,601 --> 01:03:06,602
- You ever given any thought
to a braille watch, Frank?
- Randy.

915
01:03:07,603 --> 01:03:11,504
- Stevie Wonder wears one,
or do you rank on him too?
- Honey, please.

916
01:03:11,604 --> 01:03:13,905
It's all right, Gloria.
I enjoy Randy's observations.

917
01:03:14,005 --> 01:03:17,506
My wife's name is Gail, Frank.
Can you hear that? Gail.

918
01:03:18,106 --> 01:03:19,906
Excuse me.
Gail.

919
01:03:20,607 --> 01:03:23,508
Gail strikes me as
a very beautiful woman,

920
01:03:24,508 --> 01:03:27,009
but there's a
little tension in her voice.

921
01:03:27,109 --> 01:03:29,509
It could be one
of two things:

922
01:03:30,009 --> 01:03:32,410
either Gail is nervous
or unsatisfied.

923
01:03:32,510 --> 01:03:35,011
What's your point,
Uncle Frank?

924
01:03:36,311 --> 01:03:38,612
You oughta go down
on her.

925
01:03:38,812 --> 01:03:40,913
Cut it out, Frank,
will ya?

926
01:03:41,013 --> 01:03:44,314
You're so wrapped up in sugar, you've
forgotten the taste of real honey!

927
01:03:44,414 --> 01:03:46,214
Frank,
for God's sake!

928
01:03:46,314 --> 01:03:48,915
Hear that voice?
There's fire under that dress.

929
01:03:49,015 --> 01:03:51,116
- Will you cut it out?
- Just get the fuck outta here.

930
01:03:51,216 --> 01:03:53,617
- Whoo-ah!
- Get in your limousine.

931
01:03:53,717 --> 01:03:56,918
Go down to the bowery, get with the
other fucking drunks where you belong!

932
01:03:57,018 --> 01:03:59,118
- Wait a minute.
- What?

933
01:03:59,218 --> 01:04:02,019
- Could you take it easy?
- What for?

934
01:04:02,219 --> 01:04:04,720
You want me to lay off him,
Chuckie, 'cause he's blind?

935
01:04:04,820 --> 01:04:07,821
- No, but I mean...
- My friend's name is Charles.

936
01:04:07,921 --> 01:04:10,322
He doesn't like
to be called Chuckie.

937
01:04:10,422 --> 01:04:14,123
- This is supposed to be a family
get-together. This is...
- A warning.

938
01:04:14,223 --> 01:04:18,124
Jesus Christ. Another sucker who thinks
this shitheel's a war hero.

939
01:04:18,424 --> 01:04:19,825
Whoo-ah.

940
01:04:22,726 --> 01:04:24,726
Well, once... maybe.

941
01:04:26,027 --> 01:04:29,828
I suppose he told you about his days
on Lyndon Johnson's staff?

942
01:04:30,028 --> 01:04:32,629
I was gonna go.
Now I'm not leaving.

943
01:04:32,729 --> 01:04:36,330
- Frank was earmarked for general.
- Earmarked, good word.

944
01:04:36,530 --> 01:04:40,631
- But Frank likes to spit
in everybody's eye!
- Randy, that's enough.

945
01:04:40,731 --> 01:04:44,932
So... What do they call it when they
give you the shaft in the military?

946
01:04:45,232 --> 01:04:48,634
- Passed over!
- Frank was passed over for promotion.

947
01:04:49,734 --> 01:04:51,434
Couple times.

948
01:04:55,336 --> 01:04:58,336
- You want to know what happened then?
- Will you shut your mouth?

949
01:04:58,437 --> 01:05:01,237
- He blew himseIf up.
- Stop it, Randy.

950
01:05:02,338 --> 01:05:06,439
Our colonel, here, had a grenade
juggling act at Fort Bragg or wherever.

951
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:10,140
- Fort Benning.
- He was teaching hand-to-hand combat...

952
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:13,441
Randy, look at me when
you're talking to me, son.

953
01:05:13,941 --> 01:05:17,642
I'm lookin', Frank.
His partner in the act was some captain.

954
01:05:18,443 --> 01:05:21,143
- Major Vincent Squires.
- Yeah, whoever he was.

955
01:05:21,243 --> 01:05:24,745
Before going on, they'd have themselves
a lo-cal breakfast:

956
01:05:24,845 --> 01:05:26,745
a Screwdriver for Frank,
Bloody Mary for his partner.

957
01:05:26,845 --> 01:05:28,646
No, Vincent drank
Sea Breezes.

958
01:05:28,746 --> 01:05:32,947
Judge Advocate at Benning said Col.
Slade had four to his partner's one.

959
01:05:34,448 --> 01:05:36,948
He's flying in class.
He gets all excited.

960
01:05:37,048 --> 01:05:39,449
He starts pulling
the pins out.

961
01:05:41,650 --> 01:05:44,050
One grenade
got away from him.

962
01:05:44,351 --> 01:05:45,651
Boom.

963
01:05:49,052 --> 01:05:50,953
The one that got away.

964
01:05:51,053 --> 01:05:53,653
Oh, the pin was in...
Frank claims.

965
01:05:55,054 --> 01:05:56,954
In or out, what
difference does it make?

966
01:05:57,054 --> 01:05:59,255
What kind of fucking lunatic
juggles grenades?

967
01:05:59,355 --> 01:06:01,356
Vinnie came out okay.

968
01:06:01,856 --> 01:06:04,557
And all Frank lost
was his eyesight.

969
01:06:07,758 --> 01:06:11,159
- Wanna know the truth?
- You got a handle on that,
do you, Randy?

970
01:06:11,259 --> 01:06:14,060
- He was an asshole before.
- Whoo-ah!

971
01:06:14,360 --> 01:06:16,961
Now all he is
is a blind asshole.

972
01:06:18,261 --> 01:06:19,761
Whoo-ah.

973
01:06:26,864 --> 01:06:28,964
Hey, God's a funny guy.

974
01:06:29,964 --> 01:06:32,365
God doth have
a sense of humor.

975
01:06:35,066 --> 01:06:38,367
Maybe God thinks some
people don't deserve to see.

976
01:06:40,168 --> 01:06:41,868
Whoo-ah. Hah!

977
01:06:46,069 --> 01:06:48,470
You get the point...
Chuckie?

978
01:06:52,371 --> 01:06:54,772
- Aah!
- His name is Charles.

979
01:06:55,872 --> 01:06:57,973
You can say that,
can't you? Charles.

980
01:06:58,073 --> 01:07:02,274
Know what this is, Randy? It's a choke
hold I'm teaching those lieutenants.

981
01:07:02,374 --> 01:07:06,476
- Little pressure, I bust your windpipe.
- I don't care what he said.

982
01:07:06,776 --> 01:07:09,377
- Charles.
- Just let go, please!

983
01:07:30,183 --> 01:07:31,683
Gretchen?

984
01:07:32,984 --> 01:07:34,984
You outdid yourself.

985
01:07:36,285 --> 01:07:38,786
If you twist my arm
hard enough,

986
01:07:39,286 --> 01:07:42,087
we're talking
Turkey Marbella next year.

987
01:07:42,287 --> 01:07:43,887
Who knows?

988
01:07:48,589 --> 01:07:49,989
Frank?

989
01:07:50,689 --> 01:07:52,490
Good-bye, Willie.

990
01:07:58,992 --> 01:08:00,992
I'm no fucking good...

991
01:08:03,093 --> 01:08:05,094
and I never have been.

992
01:08:10,995 --> 01:08:13,496
Come on, Charlie,
get the coats.

993
01:08:19,998 --> 01:08:22,199
Come on.
Watch your step.

994
01:08:24,800 --> 01:08:26,200
Hold it.

995
01:08:40,204 --> 01:08:42,605
Nueva York, compadre.
Vamos!

996
01:09:28,519 --> 01:09:30,320
You got a watch?

997
01:09:33,621 --> 01:09:35,321
Ah, it's 7:20.

998
01:09:36,021 --> 01:09:39,422
I didn't ask you the time.
I asked if you had a watch.

999
01:09:40,023 --> 01:09:42,023
Yeah, in the other room.

1000
01:09:42,123 --> 01:09:43,624
Get it.

1001
01:09:47,125 --> 01:09:50,326
Colonel, there's a clock
right next to your bed.

1002
01:09:51,626 --> 01:09:54,027
Does it have
a second hand?

1003
01:09:59,328 --> 01:10:00,629
Yeah.

1004
01:10:01,329 --> 01:10:02,830
Time me!

1005
01:10:30,138 --> 01:10:31,738
How long?

1006
01:10:33,739 --> 01:10:35,840
Um... about
30 seconds.

1007
01:10:37,440 --> 01:10:40,641
- I'm rusty.
- Where did you get a gun, Colonel?

1008
01:10:41,641 --> 01:10:44,442
Piece or weapon, Charlie,
never a gun.

1009
01:10:47,443 --> 01:10:49,744
Where did you get
the piece?

1010
01:10:49,844 --> 01:10:53,545
I'm an officer in the
United States Army. This is my sidearm.

1011
01:10:54,445 --> 01:10:58,246
- But you're not an officer anymore.
- So I'm retired, so what?

1012
01:10:58,847 --> 01:11:01,548
An officer never
relinquishes his 45.

1013
01:11:02,248 --> 01:11:06,149
Yeah, but you better relinquish it to me
or I'm gonna call Mrs. Rossi.

1014
01:11:06,249 --> 01:11:07,749
Good idea.

1015
01:11:07,949 --> 01:11:10,450
Then I'm going back
to school.

1016
01:11:10,650 --> 01:11:13,251
Even better.
Blue skies, green lights.

1017
01:11:13,351 --> 01:11:16,652
I hope you have a wonderful trip.
That felt like 25.

1018
01:11:17,052 --> 01:11:19,753
You oughta be able to do a 45 in 25.
Did you time me?

1019
01:11:19,853 --> 01:11:22,554
No, I did not
and I'm calling Albany.

1020
01:11:30,256 --> 01:11:32,057
That was stupid.

1021
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:34,758
Was it?

1022
01:11:37,058 --> 01:11:39,559
You're stuck with me,
Charlie.

1023
01:11:39,959 --> 01:11:41,560
No, I'm not.

1024
01:11:42,260 --> 01:11:44,661
- I'm outta here!
- Where you goin'? New Hampshire?

1025
01:11:44,761 --> 01:11:47,662
You got no money.
How you gonna do that?

1026
01:11:48,662 --> 01:11:49,962
Mmm.

1027
01:11:51,463 --> 01:11:54,264
Karen's number
tastes like Albany. Hah!

1028
01:11:55,464 --> 01:11:56,864
Fine.

1029
01:11:57,865 --> 01:12:00,466
- I'm leaving.
- Charlie? Charlie!

1030
01:12:13,770 --> 01:12:16,570
All I want from you...
is another day.

1031
01:12:18,371 --> 01:12:19,871
For what?

1032
01:12:22,872 --> 01:12:25,373
One last tour
of the battlefield.

1033
01:12:29,574 --> 01:12:32,375
I can get around a city
like New York,

1034
01:12:33,176 --> 01:12:34,576
but I...

1035
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:38,177
sometimes need a point
in the right direction.

1036
01:12:41,178 --> 01:12:43,179
What do you say,
Charlie?

1037
01:12:43,279 --> 01:12:45,879
What's one day...
between friends?

1038
01:12:50,181 --> 01:12:53,182
All right. Well, say
I stay for another day.

1039
01:12:53,282 --> 01:12:55,482
Will you give me
your weapon?

1040
01:12:55,582 --> 01:12:59,183
Oh, Charlie! I'm a lieutenant colonel,
United States Army.

1041
01:12:59,684 --> 01:13:02,084
I'm not giving my
fucking gun to anyone.

1042
01:13:02,184 --> 01:13:06,386
- Now, what are you drinkin'?
- Colonel, this... this is unacceptable.

1043
01:13:06,886 --> 01:13:10,787
Unacceptable? What are you givin' me
that prep school crap for?

1044
01:13:11,787 --> 01:13:15,188
What have they done,
taken the Oregon out of the boy?

1045
01:13:15,388 --> 01:13:17,389
Put in Harvard
Business School?

1046
01:13:17,489 --> 01:13:19,690
Then give me
your bullets.

1047
01:13:26,592 --> 01:13:29,793
You do see the sense of it,
Charlie, don't you?

1048
01:13:32,794 --> 01:13:35,294
I can't chew
the leather anymore.

1049
01:13:36,095 --> 01:13:38,295
So, why
should I share...

1050
01:13:38,796 --> 01:13:40,996
the tribe's provisions?

1051
01:13:43,197 --> 01:13:45,398
I mean,
there's no one...

1052
01:13:45,698 --> 01:13:48,599
wants to tear a herring
with me anymore.

1053
01:13:50,199 --> 01:13:52,200
The bullets, Colonel.

1054
01:13:52,500 --> 01:13:54,600
"The bullets, Colonel".

1055
01:13:54,700 --> 01:13:58,001
You sound like a guy in
"Lives of a Bengal Lancer".

1056
01:14:17,107 --> 01:14:19,208
What do you
give a shit for?

1057
01:14:19,308 --> 01:14:21,008
About what?

1058
01:14:21,809 --> 01:14:23,509
About what?

1059
01:14:24,109 --> 01:14:27,010
About whether I blow
my brains out or not.

1060
01:14:31,912 --> 01:14:35,813
- Because I have a conscience, you know.
- You have a conscience.

1061
01:14:36,113 --> 01:14:37,614
I forgot.

1062
01:14:40,514 --> 01:14:42,515
The Charlie Conscience.

1063
01:14:44,416 --> 01:14:46,816
Do we tell?
Do we not tell?

1064
01:14:48,517 --> 01:14:51,418
Do we follow the
rich boy's code or not?

1065
01:14:52,318 --> 01:14:54,819
Do we let this
blind asshole...

1066
01:14:55,419 --> 01:14:57,220
die... or not?

1067
01:14:58,220 --> 01:14:59,520
Yeah.

1068
01:14:59,820 --> 01:15:01,721
Conscience, Charlie.

1069
01:15:02,021 --> 01:15:04,122
When were you born, son?

1070
01:15:04,522 --> 01:15:07,423
Around the time
of the Round Table? Hah.

1071
01:15:08,523 --> 01:15:10,424
Haven't you heard?

1072
01:15:10,724 --> 01:15:12,724
Conscience is dead.

1073
01:15:14,025 --> 01:15:15,925
No, I haven't heard.

1074
01:15:16,725 --> 01:15:20,027
Well, then, take the
fucking wax outta your ears!

1075
01:15:22,727 --> 01:15:24,228
Grow up!

1076
01:15:35,431 --> 01:15:37,432
It's fuck your buddy.

1077
01:15:38,632 --> 01:15:40,533
Cheat on your wife.

1078
01:15:43,634 --> 01:15:46,134
Call your mother
on Mother's Day.

1079
01:15:48,335 --> 01:15:50,436
Charlie,
it's all shit.

1080
01:16:03,740 --> 01:16:05,640
Where you goin'?

1081
01:16:05,841 --> 01:16:07,641
I got piss call.

1082
01:16:08,941 --> 01:16:11,842
I know I said I need ya
for just one day,

1083
01:16:13,043 --> 01:16:15,644
but even I can't hold it
that long.

1084
01:16:17,744 --> 01:16:19,545
Oh, and, Charlie,

1085
01:16:20,245 --> 01:16:22,846
you forgot the one
in the chamber.

1086
01:16:28,547 --> 01:16:29,848
Hah!

1087
01:16:30,548 --> 01:16:32,449
There you go,
sir.

1088
01:16:33,049 --> 01:16:34,549
Thank you.

1089
01:16:38,150 --> 01:16:40,651
Twenty-six years
in the service,

1090
01:16:41,351 --> 01:16:43,652
never let an aide
shine my shoes.

1091
01:16:43,752 --> 01:16:46,553
Where you gonna be
in 26 years, Charlie?

1092
01:16:47,353 --> 01:16:51,054
Playing goIf with your friends
from the Baird School, I bet.

1093
01:16:53,555 --> 01:16:55,856
I don't even like
those guys.

1094
01:16:56,556 --> 01:16:59,357
Course you don't.
They're all assholes.

1095
01:16:59,857 --> 01:17:02,758
Be a pleasure to squeal
on 'em, wouldn't it?

1096
01:17:02,858 --> 01:17:06,459
- Yeah, well, I'm not a squealer.
- "I'm not a squealer".

1097
01:17:07,359 --> 01:17:09,960
What is this,
the Dreyfus case?

1098
01:17:13,961 --> 01:17:15,862
Ohh! Ooh, Mama!

1099
01:17:16,262 --> 01:17:17,963
There you go.

1100
01:17:18,563 --> 01:17:20,763
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1101
01:17:21,564 --> 01:17:23,364
Watch your step.

1102
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:29,566
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1103
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:35,168
There's more to this,
isn't there?

1104
01:17:36,568 --> 01:17:38,269
Isn't there?

1105
01:17:41,070 --> 01:17:44,371
- I was offered a bribe.
- Oh, now we're cookin'.

1106
01:17:46,471 --> 01:17:48,772
Mr. Trask,
the headmaster,

1107
01:17:50,172 --> 01:17:52,873
he promised to
get me into Harvard.

1108
01:17:53,073 --> 01:17:55,274
- If you squeal.
- Yeah.

1109
01:17:56,474 --> 01:17:58,175
What a dilemma.

1110
01:17:58,775 --> 01:18:02,476
Should Charlie Simms accept a
free ride into Harvard or not?

1111
01:18:04,277 --> 01:18:08,378
What do you think your friend George
would do if he were in your shoes?

1112
01:18:08,478 --> 01:18:10,579
- He is, practically.
- How?

1113
01:18:10,679 --> 01:18:14,880
I mean, it's just that Mr. Trask
hasn't promised to get him into Harvard.

1114
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:19,581
Mr. Trask doesn't have to. George's
father's gonna take care of that.

1115
01:18:21,882 --> 01:18:24,283
Do the deal, Charlie.
Take it!

1116
01:18:24,683 --> 01:18:26,383
Go to Harvard.

1117
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,684
- I can't do that.
- Why not?

1118
01:18:31,985 --> 01:18:34,886
It's just some things
you just can't do.

1119
01:18:35,486 --> 01:18:37,387
Explain 'em to me.

1120
01:18:38,987 --> 01:18:41,688
- Louder, please.
- I can't...

1121
01:18:43,789 --> 01:18:47,190
You're gonna have a tough time
in this world, Charlie.

1122
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:51,591
To ease the blow,
let me buy you a drink. Come on.

1123
01:18:54,392 --> 01:18:56,993
Double Jack Daniels
on the rocks.

1124
01:18:57,093 --> 01:19:00,194
And bring my young friend here
a Shirley Temple.

1125
01:19:01,394 --> 01:19:03,395
Hold on.
Do you have beer?

1126
01:19:03,495 --> 01:19:05,996
Certainly.
May I see some I.D.?

1127
01:19:06,096 --> 01:19:09,297
Are you interested in walkin'
the rest of your life, chappy?

1128
01:19:09,397 --> 01:19:10,697
Sir, but...

1129
01:19:10,797 --> 01:19:13,698
I'm a regular here.
My boy's going on 23.

1130
01:19:14,298 --> 01:19:17,099
Why don't you call up front,
the office?

1131
01:19:17,199 --> 01:19:19,800
Mr. Gilbert,
he's a friend of mine.

1132
01:19:20,700 --> 01:19:22,801
Any particular beer?

1133
01:19:24,001 --> 01:19:26,002
Schlitz.
No Schlitz?

1134
01:19:27,302 --> 01:19:29,203
Blatz.
No Blatz?

1135
01:19:29,803 --> 01:19:31,303
Improvise.

1136
01:19:32,304 --> 01:19:35,104
- I'll do my best, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

1137
01:19:37,305 --> 01:19:39,706
You're human, Charlie.
Beer?

1138
01:19:43,507 --> 01:19:45,708
Who are we
drinking with?

1139
01:19:45,808 --> 01:19:49,409
I'm getting a nice soap-and-water
feeling from down there.

1140
01:19:57,011 --> 01:19:59,212
- Ah... female.
- Female?

1141
01:20:00,712 --> 01:20:05,214
You're callin' her female, must mean you
like her or you wouldn't be so casual.

1142
01:20:07,814 --> 01:20:10,515
- Is she alone?
- Yeah, she's alone.

1143
01:20:13,816 --> 01:20:16,517
Things are heatin' up.
Chestnut hair?

1144
01:20:17,117 --> 01:20:19,118
Brown...
Iight brown.

1145
01:20:20,518 --> 01:20:22,119
Twenty-two?

1146
01:20:25,820 --> 01:20:28,121
Wh... What am I,
a guy at a carnival?

1147
01:20:28,221 --> 01:20:31,522
The day we stop lookin',
Charlie, is the day we die.

1148
01:20:32,222 --> 01:20:33,522
Move.

1149
01:20:34,523 --> 01:20:36,823
- Where?
- You know where, son.

1150
01:20:36,923 --> 01:20:38,924
Don't be coy, Charlie.

1151
01:20:40,524 --> 01:20:43,325
This woman is made for you.
I can feel it.

1152
01:20:43,425 --> 01:20:45,726
Goddamn beautiful,
isn't she?

1153
01:20:45,826 --> 01:20:48,927
- She's not bad.
- Whoo-bingo! The boy's alive.

1154
01:20:50,528 --> 01:20:52,828
Come on, son,
perambulate.

1155
01:20:54,229 --> 01:20:55,829
Perambulate.

1156
01:21:05,432 --> 01:21:08,633
Excuse me, senorita,
do you mind if we join you?

1157
01:21:10,734 --> 01:21:12,834
I'm feelin'
you're being neglected.

1158
01:21:12,934 --> 01:21:15,235
Well, I'm
expecting somebody.

1159
01:21:16,535 --> 01:21:18,136
Instantly?

1160
01:21:19,836 --> 01:21:22,637
- No, but any minute now.
- Any minute?

1161
01:21:24,138 --> 01:21:26,939
Some people live a lifetime
in a minute.

1162
01:21:28,639 --> 01:21:32,140
- What are you doin' right now?
- I'm waiting for him.

1163
01:21:33,041 --> 01:21:35,841
Would you mind
if we waited with you,

1164
01:21:36,241 --> 01:21:39,843
you know, just to keep the
womanizers from bothering you?

1165
01:21:43,444 --> 01:21:45,344
No, I don't mind.

1166
01:21:45,444 --> 01:21:47,045
Thank you.

1167
01:21:50,446 --> 01:21:51,946
Charlie.

1168
01:21:55,747 --> 01:21:58,848
You know, I detect...
a fragrance in the air.

1169
01:21:59,249 --> 01:22:01,449
Don't tell me
what it is.

1170
01:22:01,649 --> 01:22:03,650
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1171
01:22:04,050 --> 01:22:05,951
Ah, that's amazing.

1172
01:22:07,251 --> 01:22:09,452
I'm in the amazing
business!

1173
01:22:09,552 --> 01:22:11,552
It is
Ogilvie Sisters soap.

1174
01:22:11,652 --> 01:22:14,853
My grandmother gave me
three bars for Christmas.

1175
01:22:15,053 --> 01:22:17,254
I'm crazy about
your grandmother.

1176
01:22:17,354 --> 01:22:20,055
I think she'd have liked
Charlie too.

1177
01:22:20,155 --> 01:22:22,456
- Don't pay any attention to him.
- What's your name?

1178
01:22:22,556 --> 01:22:23,956
Donna.

1179
01:22:24,156 --> 01:22:27,657
- Donna? I'm Frank. This here is...
- This is Charlie.

1180
01:22:28,958 --> 01:22:30,958
Yes. She likes you.

1181
01:22:31,158 --> 01:22:34,359
Charlie's having a difficult weekend.
He's going through a crisis.

1182
01:22:34,459 --> 01:22:37,260
How does he look
like he's holding up?

1183
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,261
He looks fine to me.

1184
01:22:40,361 --> 01:22:42,862
Oh! She does
like you, Charlie.

1185
01:22:47,463 --> 01:22:48,964
So, Donna,

1186
01:22:49,764 --> 01:22:51,064
ah...

1187
01:22:51,565 --> 01:22:53,265
do you tango?

1188
01:22:53,665 --> 01:22:56,266
No. I wanted
to learn once, but...

1189
01:22:57,366 --> 01:22:58,667
But?

1190
01:22:59,767 --> 01:23:02,068
But Michael
didn't want to.

1191
01:23:02,468 --> 01:23:05,169
Michael, the one
you're waiting for.

1192
01:23:05,869 --> 01:23:08,670
MichaeI thinks
the tango's hysterical.

1193
01:23:09,770 --> 01:23:12,371
Well, I think
Michael's hysterical.

1194
01:23:13,071 --> 01:23:16,572
Don't pay any attention to him.
Did I already say that?

1195
01:23:18,273 --> 01:23:20,273
What a beautiful laugh.

1196
01:23:22,274 --> 01:23:24,074
Thank you, Frank.

1197
01:23:28,976 --> 01:23:31,777
Would you like to learn
to tango, Donna?

1198
01:23:35,178 --> 01:23:36,778
Right now?

1199
01:23:37,278 --> 01:23:40,379
I'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

1200
01:23:41,980 --> 01:23:43,780
What do you say?

1201
01:23:43,981 --> 01:23:45,381
Ah...

1202
01:23:45,881 --> 01:23:48,382
I think I'd be
a little afraid.

1203
01:23:49,182 --> 01:23:50,683
Of what?

1204
01:23:51,383 --> 01:23:53,684
Afraid of making
a mistake.

1205
01:23:55,684 --> 01:23:58,485
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

1206
01:24:00,085 --> 01:24:02,686
It's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

1207
01:24:02,786 --> 01:24:06,287
If you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

1208
01:24:07,688 --> 01:24:09,588
Why don't you try?

1209
01:24:14,990 --> 01:24:16,891
Will you try it?

1210
01:24:17,691 --> 01:24:20,092
All right.
I'll give it a try.

1211
01:24:21,292 --> 01:24:23,193
Hold me down, son.

1212
01:24:30,995 --> 01:24:32,495
Your arm.

1213
01:24:35,296 --> 01:24:36,697
Charlie,

1214
01:24:37,997 --> 01:24:40,498
I'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

1215
01:24:40,598 --> 01:24:42,899
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

1216
01:24:43,699 --> 01:24:45,999
and you're at
the long end.

1217
01:24:46,700 --> 01:24:50,201
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.

1218
01:27:29,750 --> 01:27:32,550
Oh, Frank, you are
one incredible dancer.

1219
01:27:36,952 --> 01:27:39,352
Wait'll you see
Charlie dance.

1220
01:27:40,653 --> 01:27:43,854
- He's a liar. I don't dance.
- Isn't he a charmer, though?

1221
01:27:43,954 --> 01:27:47,955
Truth is, not only can he dance,
but he'll sing you a hell of a tune.

1222
01:27:48,155 --> 01:27:50,856
He can do bird calls
and imitate Bela Lugosi.

1223
01:27:50,956 --> 01:27:52,857
- Hi, honey.
- Hey.

1224
01:27:52,957 --> 01:27:55,958
Michael, this is Frank
and this is Charlie.

1225
01:27:56,758 --> 01:28:00,359
-Hi, Frank, Charlie. I'm sorry I'm late.
-Oh, that's okay.

1226
01:28:00,459 --> 01:28:03,060
These two gentlemen
entertained me,

1227
01:28:03,260 --> 01:28:04,960
and time flew.

1228
01:28:05,060 --> 01:28:07,961
Your girl is...
a hell of a tango dancer.

1229
01:28:08,962 --> 01:28:12,263
You found someone to tango with.
That's terrific!

1230
01:28:12,463 --> 01:28:14,463
Let me
shake your hand.

1231
01:28:14,563 --> 01:28:18,164
- No, it was Frank.
- Hell, I'll shake both your hands!

1232
01:28:19,365 --> 01:28:22,066
Honey, this looks like the place,
but we gotta go.

1233
01:28:22,166 --> 01:28:25,267
We got a date with Darryl
and Carol in the village.

1234
01:28:25,367 --> 01:28:27,267
Do you have a check?

1235
01:28:27,367 --> 01:28:30,768
- Michael, please. My pleasure.
- No, no. I got this.

1236
01:28:32,169 --> 01:28:34,969
Michael, get your hand outta
your pocket. I'll take it. Really.

1237
01:28:35,070 --> 01:28:36,570
Allow me.

1238
01:28:38,671 --> 01:28:40,471
Why, thank you.

1239
01:28:41,271 --> 01:28:42,772
Bye, guys.

1240
01:28:43,272 --> 01:28:44,572
Bye.

1241
01:28:52,675 --> 01:28:54,776
Darryl and Carol.
Yeah.

1242
01:29:04,378 --> 01:29:07,679
It's Apartment 17E, Colonel.
She's expecting you.

1243
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:11,681
You don't have to worry about a thing.
She's the creme de la creme.

1244
01:29:11,781 --> 01:29:13,281
My buddy took the Vice Chancellor
of Germany to her.

1245
01:29:13,381 --> 01:29:15,782
Now he wants to immigrate
to this country.

1246
01:29:15,882 --> 01:29:17,883
You did good, hombre.

1247
01:29:20,283 --> 01:29:22,284
My hair,
how is it?

1248
01:29:23,184 --> 01:29:24,885
It's perfect.

1249
01:29:27,986 --> 01:29:31,787
- I got the red foulard okay, didn't I?
- Yeah, real dark red.

1250
01:29:32,287 --> 01:29:34,588
Burgundy, Charlie,
burgundy.

1251
01:29:34,788 --> 01:29:36,388
They love it.

1252
01:29:37,689 --> 01:29:39,189
Bay Rum.

1253
01:29:41,290 --> 01:29:42,890
Windsor knot.

1254
01:29:44,391 --> 01:29:46,791
That's my heart
I'm feelin'.

1255
01:29:57,095 --> 01:29:58,595
I'm off.

1256
01:30:16,200 --> 01:30:18,201
Can you get long distance
on this?

1257
01:30:18,301 --> 01:30:20,402
And how.
Be my guest.

1258
01:30:31,805 --> 01:30:34,606
- Sugarbush lodge.
- Hi. George Willis, please?

1259
01:30:34,706 --> 01:30:36,607
One moment, please.

1260
01:30:38,107 --> 01:30:40,108
- Hello?
- Ah, Harry?

1261
01:30:40,208 --> 01:30:42,108
Chas, how are you?

1262
01:30:42,508 --> 01:30:45,609
You just caught us. We're about
to shoot George over to the airport.

1263
01:30:45,709 --> 01:30:48,410
Why is George
going to the airport?

1264
01:30:48,610 --> 01:30:52,111
Um, hold on. Maybe you should talk
to the man himself.

1265
01:30:53,312 --> 01:30:55,312
- Chas.
- Yeah. Hi, George.

1266
01:30:55,412 --> 01:30:58,813
- You just caught me.
- Harry said. Where you goin'?

1267
01:30:59,514 --> 01:31:01,514
- Home.
- To Boston?

1268
01:31:02,014 --> 01:31:04,915
Catching the puddle jumper.
Keep your fingers crossed.

1269
01:31:05,015 --> 01:31:07,416
What are you
going home for?

1270
01:31:08,616 --> 01:31:11,517
I was thinking, Chas.
This asshole, Trask?

1271
01:31:12,418 --> 01:31:14,718
He's making
no sense at all.

1272
01:31:15,218 --> 01:31:18,720
Somebody's gotta talk to him.
My father's Class of '59.

1273
01:31:19,020 --> 01:31:22,821
Your father? I thought we were
gonna keep our parents outta this.

1274
01:31:22,921 --> 01:31:26,322
This guy Trask is outta control, Chas.
Outta control!

1275
01:31:27,222 --> 01:31:29,523
Somebody's gotta
talk to him.

1276
01:31:29,623 --> 01:31:33,324
- My father's a major
fund-raiser, you know.
- No, I didn't.

1277
01:31:33,624 --> 01:31:36,425
Just relax.
He'll get us off the hook.

1278
01:31:37,525 --> 01:31:40,526
- I gotta go. Everything all right?
- Sure.

1279
01:31:40,726 --> 01:31:43,527
- I'lI see you Monday. Good-bye.
- Bye.

1280
01:32:08,835 --> 01:32:11,336
- Good night, sir.
- Good night.

1281
01:32:23,239 --> 01:32:24,940
Hiya, Charlie.

1282
01:32:26,740 --> 01:32:28,441
Watch the door.

1283
01:32:46,646 --> 01:32:48,747
What a beautiful woman.

1284
01:33:02,451 --> 01:33:05,252
- Hello, there.
- Do you see what I see?

1285
01:33:06,452 --> 01:33:09,153
Yeah.
Either there's something wrong,

1286
01:33:09,753 --> 01:33:12,154
or we got the
world's worst hangover.

1287
01:33:12,254 --> 01:33:14,155
Won't you come in?

1288
01:33:34,361 --> 01:33:35,861
Colonel?

1289
01:33:48,965 --> 01:33:51,066
Colonel,
you all right?

1290
01:33:52,266 --> 01:33:54,067
What is there?

1291
01:33:58,768 --> 01:34:01,969
It's afternoon.
You've been sleeping all morning.

1292
01:34:04,070 --> 01:34:05,571
So what?

1293
01:34:06,771 --> 01:34:09,072
I don't know.
I thought...

1294
01:34:14,773 --> 01:34:16,774
I-I talked to George
last night.

1295
01:34:16,874 --> 01:34:18,374
His, ah...

1296
01:34:19,175 --> 01:34:23,076
His father's a big-deal alumnus
at school. He's got a lot of pull.

1297
01:34:23,676 --> 01:34:25,076
Really?

1298
01:34:26,777 --> 01:34:28,578
Yeah, he's, ah,

1299
01:34:30,678 --> 01:34:32,879
he's gonna talk
to the headmaster.

1300
01:34:32,979 --> 01:34:36,280
George thinks he might
be able to get us off the hook.

1301
01:34:36,380 --> 01:34:38,381
"Get us off the hook".

1302
01:34:39,181 --> 01:34:41,782
Yeah, that's...
that's what he said.

1303
01:34:41,982 --> 01:34:43,882
Watch the "us" part.

1304
01:34:47,583 --> 01:34:50,884
Colonel, don't you wanna
get up and do something?

1305
01:34:54,686 --> 01:34:56,186
Colonel?

1306
01:34:56,586 --> 01:34:58,987
Oh, Charlie,
what do ya want?

1307
01:35:00,187 --> 01:35:01,888
I don't know!

1308
01:35:02,288 --> 01:35:04,689
But you're
making me nervous.

1309
01:35:08,390 --> 01:35:10,690
My wallet is on
the dresser.

1310
01:35:11,591 --> 01:35:13,791
Take out
your plane ticket...

1311
01:35:13,891 --> 01:35:16,192
and $400
mustering-out pay,

1312
01:35:18,793 --> 01:35:20,293
plus...

1313
01:35:21,294 --> 01:35:23,394
airport-to-school taxi.

1314
01:35:27,195 --> 01:35:29,996
Colonel, it's no rush.
I mean, I can...

1315
01:35:30,396 --> 01:35:32,297
I could stay
for a while.

1316
01:35:32,397 --> 01:35:34,998
Charlie, you already
gave me a day.

1317
01:35:36,398 --> 01:35:39,099
For that day,
I am eternally grateful.

1318
01:35:42,100 --> 01:35:44,701
But right now I have...
other plans.

1319
01:35:46,902 --> 01:35:49,302
What other plans
do you have?

1320
01:35:51,603 --> 01:35:53,203
To die, son.

1321
01:35:53,704 --> 01:35:55,604
Colonel, you're...

1322
01:35:57,905 --> 01:36:00,606
Come on, Colonel,
you're not gonna die today.

1323
01:36:00,706 --> 01:36:03,006
Charlie,
give me your hand.

1324
01:36:08,408 --> 01:36:10,509
You go now, boy.
Okay?

1325
01:36:12,809 --> 01:36:14,810
You go.
Just, uh...

1326
01:36:18,411 --> 01:36:20,712
Just leave me
sleep here.

1327
01:36:21,912 --> 01:36:24,713
Look, uh...
Can we start over, please?

1328
01:36:25,113 --> 01:36:28,014
What do you feel
like doin' today, huh?

1329
01:36:29,515 --> 01:36:31,915
I mean, look at this.
The sun is shining!

1330
01:36:32,015 --> 01:36:34,416
It's a beautiful day.
Let's...

1331
01:36:37,817 --> 01:36:41,018
Colonel, I know you don't want
to be a party poop,

1332
01:36:41,418 --> 01:36:45,119
so let's go out and do something, huh?
Let's go for a ride.

1333
01:36:50,621 --> 01:36:52,322
Yeah, a ride.

1334
01:36:52,922 --> 01:36:54,322
A ride?

1335
01:36:56,123 --> 01:36:58,924
Yeah, Colonel Slade,
what do you say?

1336
01:37:00,024 --> 01:37:02,225
Let's go for a ride,
huh?

1337
01:37:09,727 --> 01:37:11,727
What kind of ride?

1338
01:37:12,628 --> 01:37:15,329
Yeah, this is a valid
Oregon driver's license,

1339
01:37:15,429 --> 01:37:18,930
and we let appropriate customers
test-drive the Testarossa.

1340
01:37:19,030 --> 01:37:22,631
But you're 17 and with
a blind companion. That we don't do.

1341
01:37:23,031 --> 01:37:25,832
This is a $190,000
piece of machinery.

1342
01:37:26,032 --> 01:37:29,433
- I'm not letting it out this door.
- How 'bout this one over here?

1343
01:37:29,533 --> 01:37:32,134
That's a Cabriolet T.
The same deal.

1344
01:37:32,434 --> 01:37:36,735
Think I'm gonna let an unaccompanied kid
get behind the wheel of a $110,000 car?

1345
01:37:36,835 --> 01:37:39,236
He will not be
unaccompanied.

1346
01:37:39,436 --> 01:37:41,937
I'll be with him.
I'm his father.

1347
01:37:43,037 --> 01:37:45,438
- You're his father?
- Yes.

1348
01:37:46,138 --> 01:37:49,439
I have an idea. Why don't I take
your father for a test-drive?

1349
01:37:49,539 --> 01:37:53,440
- What's your quota, Freddie?
- Don't worry about my quota. I do well.

1350
01:37:53,540 --> 01:37:55,441
How many Ferraris
you sold this month?

1351
01:37:55,541 --> 01:37:58,242
That's not relevant
to this discussion.

1352
01:37:58,342 --> 01:38:00,442
Freddie,
the 80s are over.

1353
01:38:00,542 --> 01:38:03,243
Are you tryin' to tell me
these are just walkin' outta the store?

1354
01:38:03,343 --> 01:38:07,444
This is a Ferrari, the finest machinery
made in the automobile industry.

1355
01:38:07,544 --> 01:38:10,445
If you like it that much,
why are you sellin' it?

1356
01:38:10,545 --> 01:38:15,047
- I'd love to accommodate you...
- If this car performs
the way I expect it to,

1357
01:38:15,447 --> 01:38:19,848
you'll get a certified check of $101,000
and change when you come in tomorrow.

1358
01:38:20,949 --> 01:38:23,649
It's $109,000,
plus $950, plus tax.

1359
01:38:25,650 --> 01:38:27,551
Freddie, for you...

1360
01:38:28,651 --> 01:38:30,251
107 all in,

1361
01:38:30,952 --> 01:38:34,453
plus a case of champagne
to go with your leftover turkey.

1362
01:38:34,553 --> 01:38:37,554
What do you say?
Don't worry about the boy.

1363
01:38:38,554 --> 01:38:42,055
He drives so smooth,
you can boil an egg on the engine.

1364
01:38:42,255 --> 01:38:45,356
When we bring the car back,
I'll peel the egg for ya.

1365
01:38:45,456 --> 01:38:49,057
Listen, you made me laugh,
but I can't let the car go out.

1366
01:38:51,458 --> 01:38:53,258
Want a deposit?

1367
01:38:53,459 --> 01:38:56,159
This is not an
installment item, sir.

1368
01:38:59,660 --> 01:39:02,561
Freddie, you're no
spring chicken, are ya?

1369
01:39:05,362 --> 01:39:09,363
Well, you know what they call me
at the home office? The gray ghost.

1370
01:39:09,663 --> 01:39:11,964
You know why they
still keep me around?

1371
01:39:12,064 --> 01:39:15,465
There's no kid here that
can move a Ferrari like I can.

1372
01:39:15,565 --> 01:39:18,366
I'm known from coast to coast
like butter and toast.

1373
01:39:18,466 --> 01:39:20,667
Ask anybody about
Freddie Bisco.

1374
01:39:20,767 --> 01:39:23,568
When I get a Ferrari...
out the door!

1375
01:39:23,868 --> 01:39:26,669
- Hah! You just made me laugh.
- Yeah?

1376
01:39:27,569 --> 01:39:29,169
Two thousand.

1377
01:39:31,470 --> 01:39:34,571
Unless you take it,
you're gonna make me cry.

1378
01:39:37,672 --> 01:39:39,673
I'm a gray ghost too.

1379
01:39:50,976 --> 01:39:53,277
See? This is fun,
isn't it?

1380
01:40:07,081 --> 01:40:09,082
Drop her into neutral.

1381
01:40:10,582 --> 01:40:13,283
Slide her into second.
Pop the clutch.

1382
01:40:51,595 --> 01:40:54,596
Straight. Hold it
right like that. Feel it?

1383
01:40:55,496 --> 01:40:58,297
That's straight.
Just keep it straight.

1384
01:41:01,698 --> 01:41:04,699
- Keep it straight.
- No fun just to keep it straight.

1385
01:41:04,799 --> 01:41:07,900
You've got to move a little bit,
feel the road.

1386
01:41:08,100 --> 01:41:11,101
Please? Just like this.
All right? There you go.

1387
01:41:11,201 --> 01:41:13,301
Take it nice and easy.

1388
01:41:14,202 --> 01:41:16,102
Do you like this?

1389
01:41:19,303 --> 01:41:22,404
Slow it down a little.
You goin' a little fast.

1390
01:41:22,804 --> 01:41:24,805
Colonel, slow it down.

1391
01:41:26,305 --> 01:41:28,806
Something's happened
to my foot!

1392
01:41:30,206 --> 01:41:32,207
- Slow it down, please.
- Hold on, Charlie.

1393
01:41:32,307 --> 01:41:34,408
I think I've got
another gear.

1394
01:41:34,508 --> 01:41:36,208
Colonel Slade?

1395
01:41:38,409 --> 01:41:40,510
- Whoo-ah!
- Oh shit!

1396
01:41:40,810 --> 01:41:42,410
Watch out!

1397
01:41:43,611 --> 01:41:45,111
Hah-hah!

1398
01:41:45,611 --> 01:41:47,612
You'll get us killed!

1399
01:41:47,712 --> 01:41:50,513
Don't blame me, Charlie.
I can't see!

1400
01:41:52,013 --> 01:41:54,014
Colonel, slow it down!

1401
01:42:03,116 --> 01:42:05,117
Oh, God.
Oh, Jesus!

1402
01:42:06,017 --> 01:42:08,618
Now let's see
how this baby corners.

1403
01:42:08,818 --> 01:42:11,219
- Corners?
- Yeah. Say when.

1404
01:42:11,919 --> 01:42:14,520
- Say when what?
- Say when to turn.

1405
01:42:14,620 --> 01:42:18,121
- Colonel, you can't turn the car.
- Where's the turn, Charlie?

1406
01:42:18,221 --> 01:42:21,122
3:00? 2:00?
Right oblique? Right face?

1407
01:42:22,222 --> 01:42:23,923
Come on!
Talk to me!

1408
01:42:24,023 --> 01:42:26,224
Ah... it's left, I guess.

1409
01:42:26,524 --> 01:42:28,924
Left. I knew it.
Okay. Now?

1410
01:42:31,425 --> 01:42:33,726
No, no!
Not now! Not now!

1411
01:42:34,026 --> 01:42:36,327
- Now?
- Colonel, please?

1412
01:42:36,927 --> 01:42:41,128
Charlie, I'm gonna do it anyway.
Whether you say so or not, here we go!

1413
01:42:41,328 --> 01:42:43,829
Okay! Wait, wait, wait!
Just wait!

1414
01:42:43,929 --> 01:42:45,529
Here I go.

1415
01:42:46,230 --> 01:42:47,830
Wait... now!

1416
01:42:54,032 --> 01:42:56,233
I did it!
Oh, Charlie!

1417
01:42:58,934 --> 01:43:01,734
You're ridin' with
one very happy man!

1418
01:43:03,635 --> 01:43:06,236
- Turn again!
- Be specific, son.

1419
01:43:06,936 --> 01:43:09,037
- Left now!
- Okay.

1420
01:43:10,337 --> 01:43:12,238
- Ohh!
- Whoo-ah!

1421
01:43:13,238 --> 01:43:14,938
I love this!

1422
01:43:16,139 --> 01:43:19,040
I love it!
Shall we take it to the max?

1423
01:43:20,240 --> 01:43:21,841
Let me out.

1424
01:43:22,641 --> 01:43:24,741
Shit! The yellow flag.

1425
01:43:27,242 --> 01:43:29,343
I hadn't even
opened her up yet.

1426
01:43:29,443 --> 01:43:31,744
- Which way's the curb?
- Pull over. Slow down!

1427
01:43:31,844 --> 01:43:33,744
- Slow down, Colonel.
- All right, I'm doin' it.

1428
01:43:33,844 --> 01:43:37,445
- Pull over to the curb. Slow it down.
- Yep, yep. Got it.

1429
01:43:48,649 --> 01:43:52,050
- Oh, Christ.
- Ooh, I haven't had a ticket in years.

1430
01:43:55,351 --> 01:43:57,351
I'll do the talking.

1431
01:44:03,353 --> 01:44:05,554
License and registration.

1432
01:44:16,757 --> 01:44:19,558
What? Are you
test-driving this baby?

1433
01:44:19,658 --> 01:44:21,759
Don't she purr though?

1434
01:44:21,859 --> 01:44:23,860
At 70 miles an hour?

1435
01:44:24,260 --> 01:44:26,760
You should hear her
at 125. Hah!

1436
01:44:27,561 --> 01:44:29,561
Where's your license?

1437
01:44:30,662 --> 01:44:32,462
At the dealer's.

1438
01:44:32,862 --> 01:44:35,763
They give it back
when you return the car.

1439
01:44:36,263 --> 01:44:38,564
- You got I.D.?
- You bet.

1440
01:44:41,865 --> 01:44:43,365
Indeed.

1441
01:44:47,067 --> 01:44:48,867
Lt. Col. Slade.

1442
01:44:49,167 --> 01:44:50,968
And you, solider?

1443
01:44:51,168 --> 01:44:53,669
The name is
police officer Gore.

1444
01:44:55,169 --> 01:44:57,470
Doin' a hell of a job, Gore.

1445
01:44:58,470 --> 01:45:01,271
And so are you, Colonel.
Who's the kid?

1446
01:45:03,072 --> 01:45:04,772
My boy Charlie.

1447
01:45:06,373 --> 01:45:08,373
He kept tellin' me to
"Let her out".

1448
01:45:08,473 --> 01:45:10,374
What was I gonna do,
disappoint him?

1449
01:45:10,474 --> 01:45:11,774
Yes.

1450
01:45:16,176 --> 01:45:20,077
Tell you what I'm gonna do.
I'm gonna let you go on one condition.

1451
01:45:20,977 --> 01:45:24,878
- What's that?
- You take this rig
straight back to the dealer.

1452
01:45:27,879 --> 01:45:30,180
- Y-You got it.
- Shut up.

1453
01:45:31,480 --> 01:45:33,981
- You want this?
- Sure. Gore?

1454
01:45:36,682 --> 01:45:39,483
Your face and your voice
are familiar.

1455
01:45:40,283 --> 01:45:42,584
You ever in the
officer's club at Da Nang?

1456
01:45:42,684 --> 01:45:43,884
No.

1457
01:45:44,784 --> 01:45:47,685
- Never in the army?
- No. Coast Guard.

1458
01:45:50,186 --> 01:45:52,287
Good Lord.
Hah! Hah!

1459
01:45:57,488 --> 01:45:59,689
Your dad is looking good,
Charlie.

1460
01:45:59,789 --> 01:46:03,590
He's got a heavy foot.
Tell him to take it light. All right?

1461
01:46:04,390 --> 01:46:06,491
- I hear ya!
- Thanks.

1462
01:46:20,695 --> 01:46:24,096
Get out of the car, 'cause
you are not driving anymore.

1463
01:46:24,196 --> 01:46:26,997
Just keeping this baby warm,
that's all.

1464
01:46:28,698 --> 01:46:30,798
I'm not drivin' anymore.

1465
01:46:35,200 --> 01:46:36,500
Yes.

1466
01:46:41,302 --> 01:46:43,502
- Take my arm.
- I'm okay.

1467
01:46:44,102 --> 01:46:47,303
- Colonel, it's really bumpy here.
- Yeah, bumpy.

1468
01:47:00,307 --> 01:47:02,008
You all right?

1469
01:47:05,609 --> 01:47:07,009
Yeah.

1470
01:47:14,812 --> 01:47:16,712
Red light.
Hold it.

1471
01:47:22,014 --> 01:47:23,815
Taking too long.

1472
01:47:28,116 --> 01:47:30,417
Shit! Colonel!
Colonel?

1473
01:47:41,820 --> 01:47:43,320
Colonel!

1474
01:47:43,921 --> 01:47:46,021
Shit!
You all right?

1475
01:47:46,521 --> 01:47:48,722
What the hell
are you doing?

1476
01:47:48,822 --> 01:47:50,723
- Take the cane.
- I gotta take a piss.

1477
01:47:50,823 --> 01:47:53,424
- Take the cane, Colonel.
- It happens to the best of us.

1478
01:47:53,524 --> 01:47:55,724
We're on Park Avenue.
You can't go to the bathroom.

1479
01:47:55,824 --> 01:47:58,625
- Perfect place.
- You'll get arrested.

1480
01:47:59,525 --> 01:48:01,526
Never been housebroken.
Ohh!

1481
01:48:01,626 --> 01:48:03,027
Shit!

1482
01:48:04,127 --> 01:48:06,828
What's the matter
with you, Colonel?

1483
01:48:12,830 --> 01:48:15,230
What are you doing?
Stand up.

1484
01:48:16,231 --> 01:48:17,631
Come on.

1485
01:48:18,931 --> 01:48:21,432
I'm tired, Charlie.
I'm tired.

1486
01:48:23,733 --> 01:48:25,533
Give me your arm.

1487
01:48:26,134 --> 01:48:28,034
Here's your cane.

1488
01:48:29,034 --> 01:48:31,535
Take me back
to the hotel, son.

1489
01:48:37,337 --> 01:48:39,038
Home at last.

1490
01:49:00,444 --> 01:49:02,345
You all right now?

1491
01:49:04,145 --> 01:49:05,446
Yeah.

1492
01:49:09,247 --> 01:49:12,048
- Do you want to use the bathroom?
- No.

1493
01:49:21,751 --> 01:49:24,251
- Can I get you something?
- No.

1494
01:49:28,553 --> 01:49:31,754
- You sure you're all right?
- I'm fine, Charlie.

1495
01:49:49,659 --> 01:49:52,160
Do you mind
if I use the phone?

1496
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:54,060
Go ahead.

1497
01:50:12,966 --> 01:50:15,867
- Hello?
- Hi, is George there, please?

1498
01:50:16,167 --> 01:50:18,068
Senior or Junior?

1499
01:50:18,668 --> 01:50:20,168
Junior.

1500
01:50:20,669 --> 01:50:23,770
- Who's this?
- A friend of his from school.

1501
01:50:23,970 --> 01:50:27,971
George isn't going to be talking
to any friends from school right now.

1502
01:50:30,272 --> 01:50:32,172
- Oh.
- Good-bye.

1503
01:50:49,277 --> 01:50:51,778
Colonel, are you
looking at me?

1504
01:50:55,379 --> 01:50:57,280
I'm blind, Charlie.

1505
01:51:03,382 --> 01:51:05,382
I'm gonna take a nap.

1506
01:51:08,083 --> 01:51:09,984
Too much fresh air.

1507
01:51:10,584 --> 01:51:12,885
It's probably
a good idea.

1508
01:51:14,585 --> 01:51:17,086
Want me to help you
to your room?

1509
01:51:17,586 --> 01:51:18,786
No.

1510
01:51:19,887 --> 01:51:21,287
Couch.

1511
01:51:22,187 --> 01:51:24,388
I like
this couch here.

1512
01:51:27,389 --> 01:51:29,790
You sure you're
all right, Colonel?

1513
01:51:29,890 --> 01:51:31,690
I got a headache.

1514
01:51:37,792 --> 01:51:40,893
Why don't you go downstairs,
get me some aspirin, Charlie?

1515
01:51:40,993 --> 01:51:43,494
- Some aspirin.
- Yeah. Also...

1516
01:51:46,995 --> 01:51:48,996
I feel like
a cigar.

1517
01:51:50,096 --> 01:51:53,197
Get me a couple of
Monte Cristos, number one.

1518
01:51:54,797 --> 01:51:57,198
- Monte Cristos, number one.
- Yeah.

1519
01:51:57,298 --> 01:52:00,099
You won't be able to get 'em
at the newsstand downstairs.

1520
01:52:00,199 --> 01:52:02,600
So why don't you
go over to...

1521
01:52:03,100 --> 01:52:05,501
Fiftieth and Fifth,
Dunhill's.

1522
01:52:06,301 --> 01:52:08,902
Fella name of Arnold
in the humidor.

1523
01:52:10,002 --> 01:52:12,403
Tell him, um,
they're for me.

1524
01:52:13,703 --> 01:52:15,204
He'll know.

1525
01:53:04,119 --> 01:53:06,219
You're back
too fast.

1526
01:53:09,020 --> 01:53:11,721
You didn't get
my cigars, did you?

1527
01:53:16,622 --> 01:53:18,823
Get out of here,
Charlie.

1528
01:53:22,524 --> 01:53:24,425
I thought we had a deal.

1529
01:53:24,525 --> 01:53:27,626
I welched. I'm a welcher.
Didn't I tell you?

1530
01:53:30,026 --> 01:53:33,628
No, what you told me was that
you gave me all the bullets.

1531
01:53:33,728 --> 01:53:35,128
I lied.

1532
01:53:37,929 --> 01:53:41,330
- Yeah, well, you could have fooled me.
- And I did.

1533
01:53:44,031 --> 01:53:47,832
Charlie, how you ever gonna survive
in this world without me?

1534
01:53:52,233 --> 01:53:55,334
Why don't you just
give me the gun, all right?

1535
01:54:03,637 --> 01:54:05,837
Wh... What are you doing?

1536
01:54:07,838 --> 01:54:09,939
I'm gonna
shoot you too.

1537
01:54:12,539 --> 01:54:14,740
Your life's finished anyway.

1538
01:54:14,840 --> 01:54:17,941
Your friend George's gonna
sing like a canary.

1539
01:54:18,841 --> 01:54:20,642
And so are you.

1540
01:54:20,842 --> 01:54:23,543
And once you've sung,
Charlie, my boy,

1541
01:54:23,643 --> 01:54:27,144
you're gonna take your place
on that long, gray line...

1542
01:54:27,944 --> 01:54:29,845
of American manhood.

1543
01:54:31,445 --> 01:54:33,546
And you will be through.

1544
01:54:34,746 --> 01:54:37,047
I'd like to disagree
with you, Colonel.

1545
01:54:37,147 --> 01:54:40,048
You're in no position
to disagree with me, boy.

1546
01:54:40,148 --> 01:54:43,049
I got a loaded.45 here.
You got pimples.

1547
01:54:43,649 --> 01:54:47,450
I'm gonna kill ya, Charlie,
because I can't bear the thought...

1548
01:54:48,650 --> 01:54:50,551
of you sellin' out!

1549
01:54:51,151 --> 01:54:53,852
Put the gun down,
all right, Colonel?

1550
01:54:54,452 --> 01:54:57,053
What? You givin' me
an ultimatum?

1551
01:54:57,953 --> 01:54:59,454
No, I'm...

1552
01:55:00,554 --> 01:55:02,655
I give the ultimatums!

1553
01:55:04,555 --> 01:55:06,156
I'm sorry.

1554
01:55:07,656 --> 01:55:09,757
All right?
I'm sorry.

1555
01:55:12,958 --> 01:55:15,259
It's all right...
Charlie.

1556
01:55:22,161 --> 01:55:24,261
You break my heart, son.

1557
01:55:25,862 --> 01:55:27,762
All my life
I stood up...

1558
01:55:27,862 --> 01:55:30,163
to everyone
and everything...

1559
01:55:31,864 --> 01:55:34,464
because it made me feel
important.

1560
01:55:38,166 --> 01:55:40,466
You do it
'cause you mean it.

1561
01:55:43,667 --> 01:55:45,968
You got integrity, Charlie.

1562
01:55:49,769 --> 01:55:52,770
I don't know whether
to shoot ya or adopt ya.

1563
01:55:55,071 --> 01:55:57,672
Not much of a choice,
is it, sir?

1564
01:55:58,172 --> 01:56:00,272
Aw, don't get cute now.

1565
01:56:01,073 --> 01:56:04,774
- Colonel, please put the gun away?
- I asked you a question.

1566
01:56:05,274 --> 01:56:08,175
Do you want me to adopt ya,
or don't ya?

1567
01:56:09,375 --> 01:56:11,276
Please? I mean...

1568
01:56:12,476 --> 01:56:15,577
- you're just in a slump right now.
- Slump?

1569
01:56:18,978 --> 01:56:20,879
No slump, Charlie.

1570
01:56:23,079 --> 01:56:24,480
I'm bad.

1571
01:56:27,381 --> 01:56:29,181
I'm not bad. No.

1572
01:56:31,882 --> 01:56:33,483
I'm rotten.

1573
01:56:36,684 --> 01:56:38,484
You're not bad.

1574
01:56:41,285 --> 01:56:43,386
Y... You're just in pain.

1575
01:56:49,087 --> 01:56:51,488
What do you know
about pain?

1576
01:56:53,089 --> 01:56:55,589
Hmm? You little
snail darter...

1577
01:56:57,190 --> 01:56:59,390
from the Pacific Northwest.

1578
01:57:00,791 --> 01:57:03,492
What the fuck you know
about pain?

1579
01:57:06,293 --> 01:57:08,193
Let me have the gun, Colonel.

1580
01:57:08,293 --> 01:57:10,594
No time to grow a dick, son.

1581
01:57:11,494 --> 01:57:14,695
Just, just give me
the gun, all right, Colonel?

1582
01:57:16,996 --> 01:57:19,797
I'm talkin'
a parade ground. Ten-hut!

1583
01:57:23,598 --> 01:57:26,199
Soldier, that was
a direct order.

1584
01:57:28,499 --> 01:57:30,300
Give me the gun?

1585
01:57:34,001 --> 01:57:36,402
You can stay
or you can leave.

1586
01:57:37,902 --> 01:57:41,203
You understand?
Either way, I'm gonna do this thing.

1587
01:57:45,104 --> 01:57:48,105
Now why don't you leave
and spare yourseIf?

1588
01:57:51,906 --> 01:57:54,107
I want your gun, Colonel.

1589
01:58:02,910 --> 01:58:05,311
I'm gonna give myself
a count.

1590
01:58:10,312 --> 01:58:12,713
You need a count
for balance.

1591
01:58:16,414 --> 01:58:18,014
Five, four...

1592
01:58:20,115 --> 01:58:21,516
three...

1593
01:58:25,517 --> 01:58:26,917
two...

1594
01:58:29,518 --> 01:58:31,118
one. Fuck it.

1595
01:58:40,721 --> 01:58:42,522
Gimme! Fuck it!

1596
01:58:46,423 --> 01:58:48,524
- Get out of here!
- I'm stayin' right here!

1597
01:58:48,624 --> 01:58:51,325
- Get outta here!
- I'm stayin' right here.

1598
01:58:51,425 --> 01:58:54,526
- I'll blow your fuckin' head off!
- Then do it!

1599
01:58:54,626 --> 01:58:57,326
You want to do it?
Do it! Let's go.

1600
01:58:57,927 --> 01:58:59,227
Fuck.

1601
01:59:02,928 --> 01:59:04,729
Get outta here!

1602
01:59:07,029 --> 01:59:09,330
You fucked up, all right?
So what?

1603
01:59:09,430 --> 01:59:12,931
So everybody does it.
Get on with your life, would ya?

1604
01:59:13,431 --> 01:59:15,732
What life?
I got no life!

1605
01:59:20,133 --> 01:59:22,134
I'm in the dark here!

1606
01:59:24,135 --> 01:59:26,735
You understand?
I'm in the dark!

1607
01:59:34,238 --> 01:59:37,239
So give up. You want
to give up, give up...

1608
01:59:38,039 --> 01:59:39,940
'cause I'm givin' up too.

1609
01:59:40,040 --> 01:59:42,040
You said I'm through.
You're right.

1610
01:59:42,140 --> 01:59:44,041
We're both through.
It's all over.

1611
01:59:44,141 --> 01:59:47,142
So let's get on with it.
Let's fuckin' do it.

1612
01:59:47,842 --> 01:59:51,643
Let's fuckin' pull the trigger,
you miserable blind motherfucker.

1613
02:00:00,846 --> 02:00:02,746
Pull the trigger.

1614
02:00:04,347 --> 02:00:06,348
Here we go, Charlie.

1615
02:00:07,548 --> 02:00:09,048
I'm ready.

1616
02:00:17,351 --> 02:00:19,352
You don't want to die.

1617
02:00:21,552 --> 02:00:23,553
And neither do you.

1618
02:00:26,754 --> 02:00:29,055
Give me one reason not to.

1619
02:00:34,156 --> 02:00:37,457
I'll give you two. You can
dance the tango and drive a Ferrari...

1620
02:00:37,557 --> 02:00:40,158
better than anyone
I've ever seen.

1621
02:00:45,560 --> 02:00:48,060
You never seen anyone
do either.

1622
02:00:52,062 --> 02:00:54,262
Give me the gun, Colonel.

1623
02:01:05,266 --> 02:01:08,066
Oh, where do I go
from here, Charlie?

1624
02:01:08,967 --> 02:01:11,568
If you're tangled up,
just tango on.

1625
02:01:14,969 --> 02:01:17,469
You askin' me
to dance, Charlie?

1626
02:01:24,571 --> 02:01:27,873
Did you ever have the feelin'
that you wanted to go

1627
02:01:30,673 --> 02:01:33,974
And still had the feelin'
that you wanted to stay

1628
02:01:51,780 --> 02:01:54,081
You like my blues, Charlie?

1629
02:01:57,081 --> 02:01:59,182
Yeah, they're beautiful.

1630
02:02:00,583 --> 02:02:03,383
I wore these for
Lyndon's inauguration.

1631
02:02:08,585 --> 02:02:11,686
Of course, uh, we weren't
the number one ball.

1632
02:02:16,187 --> 02:02:18,388
But he dropped by anyway.

1633
02:02:20,989 --> 02:02:23,590
Will you please
give me the gun?

1634
02:02:27,291 --> 02:02:30,592
You're askin' an officer
to surrender his side arm.

1635
02:02:34,093 --> 02:02:38,294
You don't have to surrender it.
You just put it down for a little while.

1636
02:02:39,594 --> 02:02:41,895
All right?
Just put it down.

1637
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:55,299
Boy, I could use
a drink, Charlie.

1638
02:02:59,400 --> 02:03:01,701
How about a cup of coffee?

1639
02:03:02,301 --> 02:03:05,202
Too big a leap for me
right now, Charlie.

1640
02:03:07,303 --> 02:03:09,304
Maybe tomorrow. Hah!

1641
02:03:11,804 --> 02:03:14,805
No, a Mr. John Daniels
would be preferred.

1642
02:03:18,806 --> 02:03:20,607
No water, Charlie.

1643
02:03:22,508 --> 02:03:24,008
No water.

1644
02:03:24,608 --> 02:03:26,009
Please.

1645
02:03:34,611 --> 02:03:36,912
Here's your drink,
Colonel.

1646
02:03:41,613 --> 02:03:43,514
Oh. I'm so sorry.

1647
02:03:45,515 --> 02:03:48,015
What time do you want me
to turn down the bed?

1648
02:03:48,115 --> 02:03:51,616
- Uh, maybe later, all right?
- What he means, senorita,

1649
02:03:53,617 --> 02:03:55,418
is come right in.

1650
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:01,019
- Later, please?
- Yes, sir.

1651
02:04:02,920 --> 02:04:04,620
Good afternoon.

1652
02:04:08,822 --> 02:04:10,422
Nice voice.

1653
02:04:14,523 --> 02:04:16,524
Boy, you have
a one-track mind.

1654
02:04:16,624 --> 02:04:20,125
Mm-hmm. Is there anything else
in this world, Charlie?

1655
02:04:23,126 --> 02:04:27,027
- Not for you.
- You know what's kept me
goin' all these years?

1656
02:04:29,528 --> 02:04:31,729
The thought that one day...

1657
02:04:43,632 --> 02:04:45,233
Never mind.

1658
02:04:45,633 --> 02:04:47,233
The what?

1659
02:04:49,434 --> 02:04:50,835
Silly.

1660
02:04:53,735 --> 02:04:56,636
Just the thought
that maybe one day, I'd...

1661
02:05:00,337 --> 02:05:03,538
I could have a woman's arms
wrapped around me...

1662
02:05:05,239 --> 02:05:07,640
and her legs
wrapped around me.

1663
02:05:10,140 --> 02:05:11,641
And what?

1664
02:05:16,542 --> 02:05:20,244
That I could wake up in the morning
and she'd still be there.

1665
02:05:22,344 --> 02:05:24,045
Smell of her.

1666
02:05:25,145 --> 02:05:27,046
All funky and warm.

1667
02:05:31,747 --> 02:05:33,848
I finally gave up on it.

1668
02:05:36,949 --> 02:05:39,649
I don't know why
you can't have that.

1669
02:05:42,550 --> 02:05:44,951
You know, when we get back
to New Hampshire,

1670
02:05:45,051 --> 02:05:47,952
I don't know why
you can't find someone.

1671
02:05:48,152 --> 02:05:50,753
I mean, you're
a good-lookin' guy,

1672
02:05:51,653 --> 02:05:54,154
and you're fun
to be with, and...

1673
02:05:55,354 --> 02:05:58,955
you're a great travel companion,
sensitive, compassionate.

1674
02:06:04,657 --> 02:06:06,058
Charlie,

1675
02:06:07,058 --> 02:06:09,259
are you
fuckin' with me?

1676
02:06:13,160 --> 02:06:14,460
Yes.

1677
02:06:18,461 --> 02:06:19,862
Yeah?

1678
02:06:20,262 --> 02:06:21,862
Hey, Manny.

1679
02:06:24,963 --> 02:06:27,764
My God. We... We...
We missed our plane.

1680
02:06:28,865 --> 02:06:31,865
Your plane, Charlie.
My ticket was one-way.

1681
02:06:34,966 --> 02:06:38,968
- New England Thruway
all the way, Colonel?
- All the way, Rinaldo.

1682
02:06:51,071 --> 02:06:54,172
I'm gettin' that
heavy feelin' again, Charlie.

1683
02:06:54,872 --> 02:06:56,273
Uh...

1684
02:06:57,973 --> 02:06:59,374
"Uh"?

1685
02:07:00,274 --> 02:07:03,375
I think you were right
about George and his father.

1686
02:07:03,475 --> 02:07:06,476
- Uh, I'm sorry to hear that.
- When we get back,

1687
02:07:06,576 --> 02:07:10,077
Mr. Trask is bringin' us up in front
of the whole school.

1688
02:07:10,677 --> 02:07:12,778
Puttin' your feet
to the fire, huh?

1689
02:07:12,878 --> 02:07:15,979
Special meeting of
the Disciplinary Committee.

1690
02:07:17,479 --> 02:07:20,080
And what are you
gonna tell 'em?

1691
02:07:22,781 --> 02:07:25,482
I don't know.
I'lI think of somethin'.

1692
02:07:27,182 --> 02:07:30,383
Oh, Charlie, why are you
all alone in this thing?

1693
02:07:31,184 --> 02:07:33,484
Hmm? Where's your father?

1694
02:07:35,885 --> 02:07:37,285
He left.

1695
02:07:39,086 --> 02:07:42,587
I thought it was a mom-and-pop store.
Who's the "pop"?

1696
02:07:43,587 --> 02:07:46,088
- It's my stepfather.
- Oh, yeah.

1697
02:07:50,489 --> 02:07:52,390
But why isn't he in on this?

1698
02:07:52,490 --> 02:07:54,691
Somethin'
wrong with him?

1699
02:07:54,891 --> 02:07:57,192
No, he's okay.
We just, uh...

1700
02:07:58,692 --> 02:08:01,693
- We don't get along very well.
- Why not?

1701
02:08:03,493 --> 02:08:06,294
- 'Cause he's an asshole.
- Ah. Ha-ha!

1702
02:08:09,495 --> 02:08:11,996
Well, that's all right, Charlie.

1703
02:08:14,697 --> 02:08:17,198
Every family's got one
nowadays.

1704
02:08:47,807 --> 02:08:50,008
- That's it?
- That's it.

1705
02:08:50,408 --> 02:08:53,909
- Take care of yourself, kid.
- All right, Manny. Thanks.

1706
02:08:59,210 --> 02:09:01,011
No, I'm not open.

1707
02:09:03,312 --> 02:09:05,212
I hate good-byes.

1708
02:09:07,313 --> 02:09:09,914
So, uh, you'll be
all right, huh?

1709
02:09:11,814 --> 02:09:13,515
I'll be fine.

1710
02:09:15,615 --> 02:09:17,216
All right.

1711
02:09:18,016 --> 02:09:19,717
What's that?

1712
02:09:22,918 --> 02:09:24,918
Uh, that's first bell.

1713
02:09:26,319 --> 02:09:28,820
Just got time
to get cleaned up.

1714
02:09:30,620 --> 02:09:32,521
Oh. I almost forgot.

1715
02:09:38,422 --> 02:09:40,423
I owe you some money.

1716
02:09:42,524 --> 02:09:45,425
Three hundred dollars,
hmm? Job well done.

1717
02:09:49,326 --> 02:09:51,426
You ever need any
references, Charlie,

1718
02:09:51,526 --> 02:09:54,127
- I'm your man.
- Thanks, Colonel.

1719
02:10:03,330 --> 02:10:07,231
- Uh, it's 16 Water Street.
Just over the bridge.
- We'll find it.

1720
02:10:08,432 --> 02:10:10,232
Good-bye, Charlie.

1721
02:10:12,033 --> 02:10:13,933
Good-bye, Colonel.

1722
02:10:17,134 --> 02:10:18,835
Come here, son.

1723
02:10:34,540 --> 02:10:36,140
Okay, Manny.

1724
02:11:50,763 --> 02:11:52,563
George. George!

1725
02:12:31,775 --> 02:12:34,776
I called an open meeting
of this institution this morning...

1726
02:12:34,876 --> 02:12:38,277
because the incident that
occurred this Tuesday last...

1727
02:12:38,377 --> 02:12:41,378
describes an issue
that concerns all of us.

1728
02:12:44,079 --> 02:12:47,280
Not an isolated case
of vandalism, what happened...

1729
02:12:47,380 --> 02:12:50,281
is a symptom
of the sickness of a society,

1730
02:12:51,982 --> 02:12:55,283
a sickness which runs
counter to the principles...

1731
02:12:55,983 --> 02:12:58,284
this school was founded on,

1732
02:12:59,884 --> 02:13:04,385
a school, among whose graduates two have
sat behind the desk in the Oval Office,

1733
02:13:05,186 --> 02:13:07,086
in the White House.

1734
02:13:08,087 --> 02:13:11,187
Baird men have run state departments
and investment houses,

1735
02:13:11,288 --> 02:13:14,689
founded department stores
and coached football teams.

1736
02:13:15,489 --> 02:13:19,090
Our alumni receive their bulletins
in ashrams in lndia...

1737
02:13:19,290 --> 02:13:21,191
and in palaces
in Jordan.

1738
02:13:21,291 --> 02:13:23,491
We are, in fact,
known around the world...

1739
02:13:23,591 --> 02:13:26,392
as the cradle
of this country's leadership.

1740
02:13:26,492 --> 02:13:28,993
- A beacon in the nation's...
- What are you doing here?

1741
02:13:29,093 --> 02:13:32,094
- Got room for me up there, Charlie?
- But today,

1742
02:13:32,194 --> 02:13:35,095
- we are bleeding from disrespect,
- Yeah, I guess so.

1743
02:13:35,195 --> 02:13:38,296
- Give us a hand.
- disrespect for our values...

1744
02:13:39,296 --> 02:13:41,997
and a disrespect
for our standards,

1745
02:13:43,197 --> 02:13:45,898
a disrespect for
the Baird tradition.

1746
02:13:46,698 --> 02:13:49,599
And, as the custodians
of that tradition,

1747
02:13:50,299 --> 02:13:53,200
we are here today
to protect each other...

1748
02:13:55,301 --> 02:13:57,602
from those
who threaten it.

1749
02:13:59,002 --> 02:14:01,203
Who is this, Mr. Simms?

1750
02:14:01,703 --> 02:14:04,304
- Uh...
- This is Mr. Frank Slade,

1751
02:14:05,804 --> 02:14:09,005
Lieutenant Colonel,
United States Army, retired.

1752
02:14:10,506 --> 02:14:12,806
I'm here in place
of Charlie's parents.

1753
02:14:12,906 --> 02:14:15,407
- Excuse me?
- In loco parentis.

1754
02:14:18,508 --> 02:14:21,409
They could not make
the trip from Oregon today.

1755
02:14:21,509 --> 02:14:24,010
And what is your relationship
to Mr. Simms?

1756
02:14:24,110 --> 02:14:26,110
Is this a courtroom?

1757
02:14:27,511 --> 02:14:30,812
- Closest thing we could manage to it.
- Then if we're taking oaths,

1758
02:14:30,912 --> 02:14:33,813
there's a few people
I'd like to swear in.

1759
02:14:35,613 --> 02:14:39,014
There are no oaths at Baird.
We are all on our honor.

1760
02:14:42,916 --> 02:14:45,016
Larry and Franny Simms...

1761
02:14:45,616 --> 02:14:48,317
are very dear,
close friends of mine.

1762
02:14:48,617 --> 02:14:52,018
They've asked me to appear here
on Charlie's behalf.

1763
02:14:52,719 --> 02:14:54,119
Okay?

1764
02:14:56,620 --> 02:14:59,220
Happy to have you
with us, Colonel.

1765
02:15:03,322 --> 02:15:04,822
Mr. Willis.

1766
02:15:07,123 --> 02:15:10,024
- Which Mr. Willis?
- George, Junior, sir.

1767
02:15:15,125 --> 02:15:18,126
You were in a position
last Tuesday night...

1768
02:15:18,526 --> 02:15:22,027
to see who committed
this act of vandalism. Who was it?

1769
02:15:24,928 --> 02:15:27,629
Well, uh, I have
an idea who it was.

1770
02:15:28,329 --> 02:15:32,231
No, no, not an idea, Mr. Willis.
Did you see or did you not see?

1771
02:15:34,831 --> 02:15:36,232
Well...

1772
02:15:37,932 --> 02:15:40,333
I didn't have
my contacts in.

1773
02:15:44,134 --> 02:15:45,635
Come on.

1774
02:15:49,336 --> 02:15:52,337
I was in the library.
I'd taken my glasses off,

1775
02:15:52,437 --> 02:15:55,338
and I was gonna put
my contacts back in.

1776
02:15:55,738 --> 02:15:56,938
Um,

1777
02:15:57,938 --> 02:15:59,139
I...

1778
02:16:00,139 --> 02:16:02,040
Then I helped
Simms close up,

1779
02:16:02,140 --> 02:16:05,041
and the next thing I know,
we're outside,

1780
02:16:05,741 --> 02:16:08,342
and I hear this sound,
and I, um,

1781
02:16:09,742 --> 02:16:12,643
didn't have any time
to put my contacts in.

1782
02:16:12,843 --> 02:16:15,944
Whom, with your limited vision,
did you see?

1783
02:16:33,549 --> 02:16:35,850
Like I say,
it was blurry.

1784
02:16:37,150 --> 02:16:38,451
Uh,

1785
02:16:41,452 --> 02:16:43,953
I can't see
without my contacts.

1786
02:16:44,153 --> 02:16:46,453
What did you see,
Mr. Willis?

1787
02:16:46,553 --> 02:16:47,954
What?

1788
02:16:49,054 --> 02:16:51,755
- What, you mean definitively?
- Stop fencing with me, Mr. Willis!

1789
02:16:51,855 --> 02:16:53,956
Tell me what you saw!

1790
02:16:58,857 --> 02:17:01,458
Now, don't hold me
to this, but...

1791
02:17:01,558 --> 02:17:03,759
no contacts, it's dark...

1792
02:17:05,759 --> 02:17:07,660
and everything, I mean...

1793
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,360
Mr. Willis!

1794
02:17:11,161 --> 02:17:12,661
Maybe...

1795
02:17:15,762 --> 02:17:17,563
Harry Havemeyer,

1796
02:17:18,363 --> 02:17:20,864
Trent Potter
and Jimmy Jameson.

1797
02:17:25,665 --> 02:17:28,166
- Maybe?
- Ballpark, best guess.

1798
02:17:30,567 --> 02:17:33,368
Could you provide us
with some detail?

1799
02:17:34,768 --> 02:17:37,169
I mean, why don't
you ask Charlie?

1800
02:17:37,269 --> 02:17:39,570
I really think
he was closer.

1801
02:17:48,272 --> 02:17:49,773
Mr. Simms.

1802
02:17:50,273 --> 02:17:51,573
Yes.

1803
02:17:52,573 --> 02:17:54,774
You don't wear
contact lenses, do you?

1804
02:17:54,874 --> 02:17:56,275
No, sir.

1805
02:17:58,675 --> 02:18:01,776
With your untrammeled sight,
whom did you see?

1806
02:18:07,178 --> 02:18:09,679
Well, I saw...
I saw something,

1807
02:18:10,779 --> 02:18:13,180
but I
I couldn't say who.

1808
02:18:13,880 --> 02:18:16,781
All right.
What was the something you saw?

1809
02:18:21,082 --> 02:18:24,783
- I couldn't say.
- You couldn't say or you wouldn't say?

1810
02:18:26,584 --> 02:18:28,584
Well, I just...
I...

1811
02:18:32,286 --> 02:18:34,786
- I just couldn't say. I'm...
- Couldn't, wouldn't, shouldn't.

1812
02:18:34,886 --> 02:18:36,787
You're exhausting
my patience...

1813
02:18:36,887 --> 02:18:38,988
and making a mockery
of these proceedings.

1814
02:18:39,088 --> 02:18:40,188
I will give you
one last chance.

1815
02:18:40,288 --> 02:18:42,889
The consequences of your response
will be dire.

1816
02:18:42,989 --> 02:18:46,590
By dire I mean your future
will be jeopardized permanently.

1817
02:18:48,391 --> 02:18:50,491
Now for the last time,

1818
02:18:50,791 --> 02:18:53,292
what did you see
last Tuesday night...

1819
02:18:53,392 --> 02:18:55,293
outside my office?

1820
02:18:58,594 --> 02:19:00,294
I saw somebody.

1821
02:19:00,594 --> 02:19:02,595
"I saw somebody". Good.

1822
02:19:04,295 --> 02:19:06,296
Did you see
their size and shape?

1823
02:19:06,396 --> 02:19:07,796
Yeah.

1824
02:19:09,297 --> 02:19:12,198
And they were
the size and shape of whom?

1825
02:19:18,400 --> 02:19:20,900
They were
the size and shape...

1826
02:19:35,905 --> 02:19:38,306
of most any
Baird student, sir.

1827
02:19:52,610 --> 02:19:55,111
I am left
with no real witness.

1828
02:19:56,811 --> 02:20:00,613
Mr. Willis's testimony is
not only vague, it is unsubstantiated.

1829
02:20:00,713 --> 02:20:03,614
The substance I was
looking for, Mr. Simms,

1830
02:20:03,714 --> 02:20:05,714
was to come from you.

1831
02:20:09,215 --> 02:20:10,716
I'm sorry.

1832
02:20:12,316 --> 02:20:14,517
I'm sorry too, Mr. Simms,

1833
02:20:15,117 --> 02:20:17,518
because you know
what I'm going to do,

1834
02:20:17,618 --> 02:20:19,919
inasmuch as I can't punish
Mr. Havemeyer,

1835
02:20:20,019 --> 02:20:22,119
Mr. Potter or Mr. Jameson?

1836
02:20:22,219 --> 02:20:24,220
And I won't punish
Mr. Willis.

1837
02:20:24,320 --> 02:20:26,721
He's the only party
to this incident...

1838
02:20:26,821 --> 02:20:30,122
who is still worthy of
calling himseIf a Baird man.

1839
02:20:31,222 --> 02:20:34,623
I'm going to recommend to
the Disciplinary Committee...

1840
02:20:35,523 --> 02:20:37,424
that you be expelled.

1841
02:20:37,524 --> 02:20:40,325
Mr. Simms, you are
a cover-up artist...

1842
02:20:40,425 --> 02:20:42,325
and you are a liar.

1843
02:20:42,425 --> 02:20:44,226
But not a snitch!

1844
02:20:44,526 --> 02:20:46,127
Excuse me?

1845
02:20:47,227 --> 02:20:48,927
No, I don't
think I will.

1846
02:20:49,027 --> 02:20:52,028
- Mr. Slade.
- This is such a crock of shit!

1847
02:20:53,629 --> 02:20:56,430
Please watch your language,
Mr. Slade.

1848
02:20:56,530 --> 02:20:59,431
You are in the Baird school,
not a barracks.

1849
02:20:59,531 --> 02:21:02,732
Mr. Simms, I will give you one
final opportunity to speak up.

1850
02:21:02,832 --> 02:21:05,132
Mr. Simms
doesn't want it.

1851
02:21:05,432 --> 02:21:07,333
He doesn't need
to be labeled...

1852
02:21:07,433 --> 02:21:10,034
"still worthy of
being a Baird man".

1853
02:21:10,134 --> 02:21:12,034
What the hell
is that?

1854
02:21:12,134 --> 02:21:14,035
What is your motto here?

1855
02:21:14,135 --> 02:21:17,436
"Boys, inform on your
classmates, save your hide;

1856
02:21:18,436 --> 02:21:21,337
anything short of that,
we're gonna burn you at the stake"?

1857
02:21:21,437 --> 02:21:23,238
Well, gentlemen,

1858
02:21:24,238 --> 02:21:27,239
when the shit hits the fan,
some guys run...

1859
02:21:27,539 --> 02:21:29,440
and some guys stay.

1860
02:21:29,540 --> 02:21:32,941
Here's Charlie facin' the fire,
and there's George...

1861
02:21:33,141 --> 02:21:35,342
hidin' in
big daddy's pocket.

1862
02:21:35,442 --> 02:21:37,342
And what are you doin'?

1863
02:21:37,442 --> 02:21:39,343
You're gonna
reward George...

1864
02:21:39,443 --> 02:21:41,443
and destroy Charlie.

1865
02:21:42,844 --> 02:21:46,645
- Are you finished, Mr. Slade?
- No, I'm just gettin' warmed up.

1866
02:21:47,345 --> 02:21:49,846
I don't know who
went to this place.

1867
02:21:49,946 --> 02:21:52,647
William Howard Taft,
William Jennings Bryant,

1868
02:21:52,747 --> 02:21:54,647
William Tell, whoever.

1869
02:21:54,748 --> 02:21:57,548
Their spirit is dead,
if they ever had one.

1870
02:21:57,648 --> 02:21:58,949
It's gone.

1871
02:21:59,049 --> 02:22:01,550
You're buildin'
a rat ship here,

1872
02:22:02,450 --> 02:22:04,951
a vessel for
seagoin' snitches.

1873
02:22:05,251 --> 02:22:08,852
And if you think you're
preparin' these minnows for manhood,

1874
02:22:09,152 --> 02:22:11,052
you better think again,

1875
02:22:11,153 --> 02:22:14,053
because I say you are
killin' the very spirit...

1876
02:22:14,153 --> 02:22:16,254
this institution
proclaims it instills.

1877
02:22:16,354 --> 02:22:17,955
What a sham.

1878
02:22:19,455 --> 02:22:22,456
What kind of a show
are you guys puttin' on here today?

1879
02:22:22,556 --> 02:22:26,057
I mean, the only class
in this act is sittin' next to me.

1880
02:22:26,157 --> 02:22:29,358
I'm here to tell you
this boy's soul is intact.

1881
02:22:29,958 --> 02:22:32,759
It's non-negotiable.
You know how I know?

1882
02:22:32,859 --> 02:22:36,360
Someone here, and I'm not gonna say who,
offered to buy it.

1883
02:22:36,460 --> 02:22:40,061
- Only Charlie here wasn't sellin'.
- Sir, you're out of order.

1884
02:22:40,161 --> 02:22:42,262
I show you out of order.

1885
02:22:42,562 --> 02:22:45,663
You don't know what
out of order is, Mr. Trask.

1886
02:22:45,763 --> 02:22:48,164
I'd show you,
but I'm too old,

1887
02:22:48,264 --> 02:22:50,665
I'm too tired,
too fuckin' blind.

1888
02:22:50,765 --> 02:22:53,966
If I were the man I was
five years ago, I'd take...

1889
02:22:54,066 --> 02:22:56,466
a flamethrower
to this place!

1890
02:22:58,667 --> 02:23:02,268
Out of order? Who the hell
you think you're talkin' to?

1891
02:23:03,869 --> 02:23:06,169
I've been around,
you know?

1892
02:23:06,770 --> 02:23:09,170
There was a time
I could see.

1893
02:23:09,670 --> 02:23:11,371
And I have seen.

1894
02:23:11,671 --> 02:23:13,972
Boys like these,
younger than these,

1895
02:23:14,072 --> 02:23:17,073
their arms torn out,
their legs ripped off.

1896
02:23:17,973 --> 02:23:20,774
But there is nothin'
like the sight...

1897
02:23:21,174 --> 02:23:23,075
of an amputated spirit.

1898
02:23:23,175 --> 02:23:25,675
There is
no prosthetic for that.

1899
02:23:26,976 --> 02:23:30,677
You think you're merely sendin'
this splendid foot soldier...

1900
02:23:31,177 --> 02:23:34,178
back home to Oregon with
his tail between his legs,

1901
02:23:34,278 --> 02:23:36,179
but I say you are...

1902
02:23:36,279 --> 02:23:38,279
executin' his soul!

1903
02:23:39,680 --> 02:23:41,180
And why?

1904
02:23:41,980 --> 02:23:44,381
Because he's not
a Baird man.

1905
02:23:44,981 --> 02:23:47,382
Baird men.
You hurt this boy,

1906
02:23:47,882 --> 02:23:50,683
you're gonna be Baird bums,
the lot of you.

1907
02:23:50,783 --> 02:23:52,684
And, Harry, Jimmy,

1908
02:23:53,284 --> 02:23:55,885
Trent, wherever
you are out there,

1909
02:23:56,485 --> 02:23:58,185
fuck you too!

1910
02:24:00,786 --> 02:24:02,887
Stand down, Mr. Slade!

1911
02:24:02,987 --> 02:24:04,787
I'm not finished.

1912
02:24:05,688 --> 02:24:08,488
As I came in here,
I heard those words:

1913
02:24:09,789 --> 02:24:11,889
"cradle of leadership".

1914
02:24:11,989 --> 02:24:14,290
Well, when
the bough breaks,

1915
02:24:15,090 --> 02:24:18,091
the cradle will fall,
and it has fallen here.

1916
02:24:18,491 --> 02:24:20,192
It has fallen.

1917
02:24:20,492 --> 02:24:23,093
Makers of men,
creators of leaders.

1918
02:24:23,293 --> 02:24:26,694
Be careful what kind of leaders
you're producin' here.

1919
02:24:26,794 --> 02:24:29,895
I don't know if Charlie's
silence here today...

1920
02:24:30,595 --> 02:24:33,296
is right or wrong;
I'm not a judge or jury.

1921
02:24:33,396 --> 02:24:35,297
But I can tell you this:

1922
02:24:35,397 --> 02:24:37,397
he won't sell
anybody out...

1923
02:24:37,497 --> 02:24:39,398
to buy his future!

1924
02:24:40,498 --> 02:24:43,399
And that, my friends,
is called integrity.

1925
02:24:44,599 --> 02:24:46,500
That's called courage.

1926
02:24:46,600 --> 02:24:49,701
Now that's the stuff
leaders should be made of.

1927
02:24:55,303 --> 02:24:58,304
Now I have come to
the crossroads in my life.

1928
02:24:59,704 --> 02:25:02,505
I always knew
what the right path was.

1929
02:25:04,305 --> 02:25:07,406
Without exception, I knew,
but I never took it.

1930
02:25:08,107 --> 02:25:09,807
You know why?

1931
02:25:10,207 --> 02:25:12,208
It was too damn hard.

1932
02:25:14,909 --> 02:25:18,010
Now here's Charlie.
He's come to the crossroads.

1933
02:25:18,110 --> 02:25:20,110
He has chosen a path.

1934
02:25:20,310 --> 02:25:22,311
It's the right path.

1935
02:25:22,511 --> 02:25:25,012
It's a path
made of principle...

1936
02:25:25,112 --> 02:25:27,212
that leads to character.

1937
02:25:29,213 --> 02:25:31,814
Let him continue
on his journey.

1938
02:25:33,714 --> 02:25:37,015
You hold this boy's future
in your hands, Committee.

1939
02:25:38,416 --> 02:25:40,517
It's a valuable future,

1940
02:25:41,117 --> 02:25:42,717
believe me.

1941
02:25:43,217 --> 02:25:45,618
Don't destroy it.
Protect it.

1942
02:25:47,619 --> 02:25:49,119
Embrace it.

1943
02:25:49,719 --> 02:25:52,920
It's gonna make you proud
one day, I promise you.

1944
02:26:10,326 --> 02:26:12,526
How's that for cornball?

1945
02:26:33,533 --> 02:26:35,933
Nothing can
shut them up, sir.

1946
02:26:40,435 --> 02:26:43,336
The Disciplinary Committee will
take this matter under advisement...

1947
02:26:43,436 --> 02:26:45,236
in closed session.

1948
02:26:54,039 --> 02:26:58,640
- What are they doin', Charlie?
- I think they're going
to come to a decision now.

1949
02:27:02,642 --> 02:27:04,242
Very well.

1950
02:27:10,244 --> 02:27:13,345
Apparently, that meeting
will be unnecessary.

1951
02:27:14,045 --> 02:27:15,746
Mrs. Hunsaker.

1952
02:27:19,747 --> 02:27:22,648
The joint student-faculty
Disciplinary Committee...

1953
02:27:22,748 --> 02:27:24,648
needs no further sessions.

1954
02:27:24,748 --> 02:27:27,149
They have come
to a decision.

1955
02:27:27,249 --> 02:27:29,850
Misters Havemeyer,
Potter and Jameson...

1956
02:27:29,950 --> 02:27:31,851
are placed
on probation...

1957
02:27:31,951 --> 02:27:34,751
for suspicion of
ungentlemanly conduct.

1958
02:27:35,852 --> 02:27:39,153
It is further recommended
that Mr. George Willis, Jr....

1959
02:27:39,253 --> 02:27:42,354
receive neither recognition
nor commendation...

1960
02:27:42,554 --> 02:27:44,554
for his cooperation.

1961
02:27:44,955 --> 02:27:47,355
Mr. Charles Simms
is excused...

1962
02:27:47,955 --> 02:27:50,756
from any further response
to this incident.

1963
02:27:50,856 --> 02:27:52,357
Whoo-ah.

1964
02:28:29,668 --> 02:28:31,169
Charlie!

1965
02:28:51,775 --> 02:28:55,076
- Last step.
- I can always count on you, Charlie.

1966
02:28:58,477 --> 02:28:59,977
Colonel.

1967
02:29:00,878 --> 02:29:02,378
Colonel!

1968
02:29:02,978 --> 02:29:05,079
I'm Christine Downes,
Colonel Slade.

1969
02:29:05,179 --> 02:29:07,080
I teach
Political Science.

1970
02:29:07,180 --> 02:29:08,580
I wanted to tell you
how much I appreciate...

1971
02:29:08,680 --> 02:29:11,981
- your coming here
and speaking your mind.
- Thank you. Are you married?

1972
02:29:12,081 --> 02:29:13,882
Uh...
I, uh...

1973
02:29:16,583 --> 02:29:20,284
Went to a artillery school
at Fort Sill with a Mickey Downes.

1974
02:29:20,384 --> 02:29:22,284
Thought he might've
snagged you.

1975
02:29:22,384 --> 02:29:24,685
Uh, no, no,
I'm afraid not.

1976
02:29:25,685 --> 02:29:27,986
Uh, Colonel Slade was on, uh,

1977
02:29:28,086 --> 02:29:30,087
Lyndon Johnson's staff,
Miss Downes.

1978
02:29:30,187 --> 02:29:32,287
Were you? Fascinating.

1979
02:29:32,988 --> 02:29:36,089
We should get together,
talk politics sometime.

1980
02:29:38,889 --> 02:29:40,890
Fleurs de rocailles.

1981
02:29:42,991 --> 02:29:44,291
Yes.

1982
02:29:45,892 --> 02:29:47,992
"Flowers from a brook".

1983
02:29:49,293 --> 02:29:50,893
That's right.

1984
02:29:54,094 --> 02:29:55,995
Well, Miss Downes,

1985
02:29:56,795 --> 02:29:59,196
I, I'll know
where to find you.

1986
02:30:00,296 --> 02:30:01,796
Charlie.

1987
02:30:02,297 --> 02:30:04,597
- Bye, Miss Downes.
- Bye.

1988
02:30:07,498 --> 02:30:10,099
You don't have
to tell me, Charlie.

1989
02:30:11,299 --> 02:30:12,600
5'7",

1990
02:30:14,200 --> 02:30:15,801
auburn hair,

1991
02:30:16,901 --> 02:30:18,902
beautiful
brown eyes.

1992
02:30:37,807 --> 02:30:39,608
Yabba dabba doo.

1993
02:30:41,108 --> 02:30:42,509
Hah!

1994
02:30:44,409 --> 02:30:45,710
Manny.

1995
02:30:47,810 --> 02:30:49,711
Aw, Colonel,
this is too much.

1996
02:30:49,811 --> 02:30:52,612
You earned it.
Next time Charlie and I...

1997
02:30:52,712 --> 02:30:55,413
want to take a breather to New York,
we're gonna call you.

1998
02:30:55,513 --> 02:30:57,413
You can drive us
both ways.

1999
02:30:57,513 --> 02:31:00,114
You're on. Not only
will it be an honor,

2000
02:31:00,214 --> 02:31:02,115
I'll give you
a rate.

2001
02:31:02,215 --> 02:31:04,816
I'lI see your rate
and raise you.

2002
02:31:05,116 --> 02:31:07,016
Stay outta
harm's way, Manny.

2003
02:31:07,116 --> 02:31:09,617
- Take care, Colonel.
- You too.

2004
02:31:10,317 --> 02:31:13,718
- Ready?
- No, thanks, Charlie.
I'll take it from here.

2005
02:31:13,818 --> 02:31:17,219
You go on ahead.
Manny'll drive you back to your dorm.

2006
02:31:17,920 --> 02:31:20,720
Come by before you
go home for Christmas.

2007
02:31:21,221 --> 02:31:23,421
We'lI have a little cheer.

2008
02:31:23,621 --> 02:31:26,222
And if you like,
stay for dinner.

2009
02:31:26,522 --> 02:31:29,023
Sometimes she cooks
a pot roast.

2010
02:31:29,123 --> 02:31:31,024
It's almost edible.

2011
02:31:32,324 --> 02:31:34,225
All right, Colonel.

2012
02:31:34,325 --> 02:31:37,025
- That'd be really...
- Bye, Charlie.

2013
02:31:56,732 --> 02:31:58,332
Who's there?

2014
02:31:58,732 --> 02:32:01,033
- That you, Francine?
- Yes.

2015
02:32:01,233 --> 02:32:04,034
- What are you doing?
- Taking a ride.

2016
02:32:04,634 --> 02:32:07,835
Taking a ride?
What about you giving me a lift?

2017
02:32:08,035 --> 02:32:09,735
- No.
- No?

2018
02:32:11,336 --> 02:32:13,437
Aw, come on,
Francine.

2019
02:32:14,037 --> 02:32:17,338
We should make up.
Don't you think it's time we made up?

2020
02:32:17,438 --> 02:32:19,338
- No.
- Francine?

2021
02:32:19,839 --> 02:32:21,739
- What?
- Your Uncle Frank's had himself...

2022
02:32:21,839 --> 02:32:24,440
a really hard
Thanksgiving weekend.

2023
02:32:26,541 --> 02:32:28,141
What's that?

2024
02:32:28,541 --> 02:32:30,442
I hear a chipmunk.

2025
02:32:30,842 --> 02:32:32,642
Is it a walrus?

2026
02:32:32,843 --> 02:32:34,643
No, it's Willie.

2027
02:32:34,843 --> 02:32:37,644
Willie, why don't you
help me with my bag?

2028
02:32:37,744 --> 02:32:40,245
Come on, son.
Help me with my bag.

2029
02:32:40,645 --> 02:32:42,445
Come on. Come on.

2030
02:32:42,946 --> 02:32:45,746
You got it. Hold onto it.
You're strong.

2031
02:32:45,847 --> 02:32:47,247
Come on.

2032
02:32:49,248 --> 02:32:50,848
Here we are.

2033
02:32:51,848 --> 02:32:54,249
Francine, come on
with me and Willie.

2034
02:32:54,349 --> 02:32:57,150
I'll let you make me
some marshmallow chocolate.

2035
02:32:57,250 --> 02:32:59,351
- Whaddaya say?
- Okay
