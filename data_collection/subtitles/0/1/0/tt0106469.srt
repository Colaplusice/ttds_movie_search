He's got a great
right uppercut.

So, Cruz, here's your plaque.
Your award of honor.

little cards for my mom
when she was sick in the hospital.

273
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:02,089
Those little cards
made her happy,

00:18:02,162 --> 00:18:06,690
<i>and she told me then,
"Mijo, tu eres un artista."</i>

275

You are an artist.

276
00:18:09,069 --> 00:18:11,299
I guess she was right.

277
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:14,499

was here to see it.

We'll do it.

You're right, kid.

1612

<i>-  Calmala, calmala!
- I don't give warning shots, cabron!</i>

1619

In the joint, I was hustling more money
than that punk ever dreamed of.

1625
01:51:18,687 --> 01:51:21,155
He was punchin' my time clock

1626
01:51:21,222 --> 01:51:26,785
<i>-  Aguila!  Aguila!
- The armored truck at the Zody's Saturday night. Lotta cash.</i>

1628
01:51:30,699 --> 01:51:34,032
<i> Chale! Armored truck's a dumb deal.
It's too dangerous.</i>

Not this one,

1630
01:51:38,006 --> 01:51:40,600
The driver's in on it.
He's a customer.

1631
01:51:45,880 --> 01:51:48,644
Okay, we'll do it.

1632
01:51:48,717 --> 01:51:52,517
But it's fifty-fifty, and
you wipe out Cruz's debt.

1633
01:51:52,587 --> 01:51:57,251
<i> Chale, homes! Don't get fucked up in

This is who I am.

1636
01:52:04,966 --> 01:52:09,926
So, do we gift wrap this sucker for you,
or do you walk away empty-handed?

1637
01:52:11,439 --> 01:52:15,466
Sixty-forty. Realthing
handles the cash.

1638
01:52:15,543 --> 01:52:19,639
You come up with the guns and the car.
Apache's drivin'.

You're out of it,

<i>It's payback time,

- I got you, man. I got you.
- No way.

1648
01:52:58,904 --> 01:53:00,929
- Once... I did. I did so.
- No way, man. I knew it was you.

Is this a nuclear accident
burrito or what?

1651
01:53:05,744 --> 01:53:10,181
- Something to tide us over 'til lunch.
- Us? You mean you. Two of you.

1652
01:53:10,248 --> 01:53:12,443
- Hey, I'm an undercover cop, all right?

- You're a fat undercover cop.

1654
01:53:15,587 --> 01:53:19,079

Real, right? McCann.</i>

- Who is this?

1658
01:53:31,603 --> 01:53:35,835
Look for a blue Econoline van

to kill innocent people.</i>

1719
01:59:20,302 --> 01:59:23,999
<i>[Chuey] No, you're a pinche
vato vendido, puto!</i>

1720
01:59:24,072 --> 01:59:26,597
<i>- [Spits] Fucker!
- Hey!  Calmala!</i>

1721
01:59:26,675 --> 01:59:29,803
- Hey, fuckin' relax!
- Ow! Ow! Ow!

1722
01:59:32,080 --> 01:59:34,344
Fuck you!
Fuck you, wimp!

1723
01:59:34,416 --> 01:59:38,375
Hey, homes, you can't come here anymore
unless you're gonna bust me!

1724
01:59:38,454 --> 01:59:41,184
Who the fuck gave you permission to use
my little brother in your paintings?

1725
01:59:41,256 --> 01:59:43,850
<i>I don't need permission from you.
He's my carnalito too!</i>

1726
01:59:43,926 --> 01:59:48,454
Don't you useJuanito as an excuse to
wreck your life. You don't have that right!

1727
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:53,791
<i>Si, culero.</i>

1728
01:59:53,869 --> 01:59:57,100
I don't have the right, huh?
Fuckin' right I don't.

1729
01:59:57,172 --> 01:59:59,697
You're fuckin' right
I don't have the right.

1730
01:59:59,775 --> 02:00:02,801
<i>I don't... I don't have
that fuckin'right.</i>

1731
02:00:02,878 --> 02:00:05,938
<i>You want him outta my painting, joto?
All right.</i>

1732
02:00:06,014 --> 02:00:09,973
<i>All right. There he is!
 Ahi esta!  Toma!</i>

1733
02:00:10,052 --> 02:00:12,077
Take it, man!
Come on!

1734
02:00:12,154 --> 02:00:14,714
Juanito always loved me
more than you, homes.

1735
02:00:14,790 --> 02:00:19,420
<i> Tu te creias muy chingon! You were always
too much of a badass to love the little vato!</i>

1736
02:00:19,495 --> 02:00:23,090
Just like you are now. So much of a
fucking badass you kill your own people!

1737
02:00:23,165 --> 02:00:25,827
No!

1738
02:00:25,901 --> 02:00:29,132
Don't you ever say that to me again,
Cruzito. I let you say that once...

1739
02:00:29,204 --> 02:00:31,229
<i>Que, puto?
What the fuck?</i>

1740
02:00:31,306 --> 02:00:35,106
<i>You gonna kick my ass?
Well,  caiga! Let's get down.</i>

1741
02:00:35,177 --> 02:00:39,079
- Come on! You the badass!
- I don't wanna fight with you, little brother.

1742
02:00:39,147 --> 02:00:43,675
<i>To what, bust me? Well, come on,
gabacho. You the law. Do your job.</i>

1743
02:00:45,354 --> 02:00:47,515
Do your fucking job!

1744
02:01:17,119 --> 02:01:19,679
Look at this.

1745
02:01:19,755 --> 02:01:21,723
Look at that.

1746
02:01:22,724 --> 02:01:24,851
Must be
from Quentin, huh?

1747
02:01:27,195 --> 02:01:31,154
- Hey. Hey, he's the guy...
- PCP bust. That's Popeye Savedra.

1748
02:01:31,233 --> 02:01:33,895
Miklo's connected to him.

1749
02:01:33,969 --> 02:01:36,631
<i>"La Onda a toda madre
o un desmadre. "</i>

1750
02:01:36,705 --> 02:01:38,696
<i>What's "Onda"?</i>

1751
02:01:38,774 --> 02:01:40,969
<i>No, La Onda.
It's your destiny, man.</i>

1752
02:01:41,043 --> 02:01:43,637
It's... It's like a wave
nothing can stop.

1753
02:01:43,712 --> 02:01:45,680
Uh, "madre" means mother.
So...

1754
02:01:45,747 --> 02:01:47,738
No, no, it's a lot more
complicated than that.

1755
02:01:47,816 --> 02:01:50,649
<i>This is some heavy shit,
all right? "A toda madre".</i>

1756
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:53,017
<i>Everything is perfect.
It's like...</i>

1757
02:01:53,088 --> 02:01:55,113
your mother's love.

1758
02:01:55,190 --> 02:01:57,158
<i>And "un desmadre"...</i>

1759
02:01:58,594 --> 02:02:00,721
is like you have no mother.

1760
02:02:00,796 --> 02:02:02,991
It's absolute hatred.
Complete destruction.

1761
02:02:03,065 --> 02:02:05,966
<i>In other words, you win it all
or lose everything.</i>

1762
02:02:06,034 --> 02:02:08,502
Sweet bunch of guys.

1763
02:02:08,570 --> 02:02:12,404
This big fat pig, Popeye, right here in
the center? He's gotta be their leader.

1764
02:02:12,474 --> 02:02:15,602
<i>- Hey, Aguilar?
- Look at the way they're all grouped around him.</i>

1765
02:02:15,677 --> 02:02:20,341
Hey, Aguilar, that con you
blasted just got outta surgery.

1766
02:02:20,415 --> 02:02:23,384
He's gonna be a whole lot
easier to catch from now on.

1767
02:02:38,300 --> 02:02:40,234
<i>Nurse, could you
give me a minute, please?</i>

1768
02:02:40,302 --> 02:02:42,270
Nurse?

1769
02:02:48,843 --> 02:02:52,210
<i>Por la Virgen, Miklo,
I did not know that it would...</i>

1770
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:56,080
<i>Don't talk to me about the Virgen.
Vatos Locos forever.</i>

1771
02:02:56,151 --> 02:02:59,348
That all died when you
pulled the trigger.

1772
02:03:07,529 --> 02:03:10,555
How did everything
get so fucked up, man?

1773
02:03:10,632 --> 02:03:12,896
<i>The pinche badge, ese.</i>

1774
02:03:14,769 --> 02:03:17,260
<i>You owe me, vendido!</i>

1775
02:03:18,640 --> 02:03:20,767
Who's the sellout?

1776
02:03:20,842 --> 02:03:22,969
You're tellin' me you're
workin' hard, goin' straight.

1777
02:03:23,044 --> 02:03:25,205
The next thing I know,
you're pointin' a.357 at me...

1778
02:03:25,280 --> 02:03:28,010
and there's two guys
dead on the ground.

1779
02:03:28,083 --> 02:03:31,610
I would have given you
anything, Miklo.

1780
02:03:31,686 --> 02:03:34,951
But you can't just
take away what I am.

1781
02:03:36,725 --> 02:03:39,489
You chose
the wrong side, ese.

1782
02:03:39,561 --> 02:03:42,621
There's too many of us.
You're gonna lose.

1783
02:03:42,697 --> 02:03:45,928
No, uh-uh. I don't forget
where I come from or who I am.

1784
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:48,434
That's what keeps me goin'
every day.

1785
02:03:49,938 --> 02:03:53,965
- You don't wanna hear the truth, Paco.
- What truth?

1786
02:03:54,042 --> 02:03:56,567
This? La Onda.
Is this your truth?

1787
02:03:56,644 --> 02:03:59,807
<i>Two-bit punks like Popeye Savedra
with their PCPlabs?</i>

1788
02:03:59,881 --> 02:04:04,181
Or you, robbing Zody's
and killing innocent people?

1789
02:04:04,252 --> 02:04:06,345
If that's your truth, then you're
right. I don't wanna hear it.

1790
02:04:06,421 --> 02:04:09,584
<i>Get out, puto!
You're not my blood!</i>

1791
02:04:10,925 --> 02:04:13,393
I'm cutting you off
like they did my leg.

1792
02:04:15,563 --> 02:04:17,963
You don't exist
for me anymore.

1793
02:04:33,982 --> 02:04:37,679
<i>[Inmate] Miklo!
Orale, carnalito. What's up, ese?</i>

1794
02:04:37,752 --> 02:04:39,686
<i>You're looking good,
homey.</i>

1795
02:04:47,495 --> 02:04:52,933
<i>[Inmates Whistling,
Shouting Indistinctly]</i>

1796
02:04:53,001 --> 02:04:55,162
<i>- [Banging]
- Hey, Hopalong!</i>

1797
02:04:55,236 --> 02:04:58,831
You better tell Carlos he better
stop fucking with my business!

1798
02:04:58,907 --> 02:05:01,171
Pockets,
not in public!

1799
02:05:01,242 --> 02:05:03,938
<i>[Pockets] I ain't gonna let
no junkie rip-off my customers!</i>

1800
02:05:04,012 --> 02:05:05,946
<i>[Guard] Velka, time to lock up!</i>

1801
02:05:06,014 --> 02:05:08,778
<i>Mira, mira.
It's the Bionic Man.</i>

1802
02:05:08,850 --> 02:05:10,784
<i>[Miklo] Hey, Carlos,
what's with the B.G.A.?</i>

1803
02:05:10,852 --> 02:05:13,582
Pay no mind to cheap conversation.
They're just sore losers, ese.

1804
02:05:13,655 --> 02:05:17,284
- They're just flapping their crow wings.
- Pockets is on the warpath.

1805
02:05:17,358 --> 02:05:20,725
I can't help it if the customers
know where the quality is.

1806
02:05:20,795 --> 02:05:22,729
He's been selling 'em
baby powder.

1807
02:05:22,797 --> 02:05:25,595
I don't have all day, man.
Let's take it in.

1808
02:05:25,667 --> 02:05:28,602
Hey, Majito.
Gonna be cellies, huh?

1809
02:05:28,670 --> 02:05:31,161
<i>- Orale.
- [Guard] Move over here. Let me get these cuffs.</i>

1810
02:05:32,974 --> 02:05:35,909
<i> Orale! That's
a badass pano, homeboy.</i>

1811
02:05:35,977 --> 02:05:38,036
You been burnin'
them quills, huh?

1812
02:05:38,112 --> 02:05:41,104
- You're getting good.
- It's yours.

1813
02:05:44,452 --> 02:05:46,613
My "Home Sweet Home"
picture, huh?

1814
02:05:47,789 --> 02:05:49,882
At least this bum leg
got me something.

1815
02:05:49,958 --> 02:05:52,518
I get to work
at the law library.

1816
02:05:52,594 --> 02:05:55,893
What's all that mad-dogging
between Carlos and the B.G.A.?

1817
02:05:55,964 --> 02:05:58,762
The vato's got one
sweet cocaine connection.

1818
02:05:58,833 --> 02:06:02,269
Hmm. And he's moving in
on Pockets' customers.

1819
02:06:02,337 --> 02:06:04,771
How did he connect?

1820
02:06:04,839 --> 02:06:08,832
Nobody knows. But it's dynamite shit.
Pure Bolivian flake.

1821
02:06:08,910 --> 02:06:11,344
And Montana, he just stood by
and watched Carlos jump in?

1822
02:06:11,412 --> 02:06:14,040
<i>Plata talks.</i>

1823
02:06:14,115 --> 02:06:16,606
Carlos is recruiting
lots of soldiers...

1824
02:06:16,684 --> 02:06:20,176
and buying influence on the council
to try to neutralize Montana.

1825
02:06:20,255 --> 02:06:22,689
Says it's his own personal trip,
not Onda's!

1826
02:06:22,757 --> 02:06:26,818
That's bullshit! Personal trips
is what's fucking Onda up!

1827
02:06:26,895 --> 02:06:29,159
[Groaning]
I saw that out on the streets.

1828
02:06:29,230 --> 02:06:31,960
We're cutting
our own throats.

1829
02:06:36,404 --> 02:06:38,497
<i>It's too soon
to be walking on it.</i>

1830
02:06:38,573 --> 02:06:40,541
It's a long way up.

1831
02:06:40,608 --> 02:06:44,271
But there's no way they're gonna stick
me down there on the first tier without...

1832
02:06:44,345 --> 02:06:46,540
<i>ah, my carnales.</i>

1833
02:06:46,614 --> 02:06:48,673
Ah!

1834
02:06:50,118 --> 02:06:52,052
Your own cousin did that.

1835
02:06:54,188 --> 02:06:56,748
<i>- We should put a hit on that puto.
- No, he's mine.</i>

1836
02:06:56,824 --> 02:06:59,952
His payback's
gonna take time.

1837
02:07:00,028 --> 02:07:04,226
I'm gonna make him sorry
he ever fucked with my business.

1838
02:07:04,299 --> 02:07:06,290
<i>Hey, puto.</i>

1839
02:07:06,367 --> 02:07:08,335
What the fuck do you think
you're doing, chorizo?

1840
02:07:08,403 --> 02:07:10,394
Trying to jump-start
your memory, punk.

1841
02:07:10,471 --> 02:07:13,099
Turn your ass around.
Where the fuck is Popeye Savedra?

1842
02:07:13,174 --> 02:07:15,142
I ain't seen the vato.
He took off.

1843
02:07:15,209 --> 02:07:17,177
Yeah? Right after
Zody's, right?

1844
02:07:17,245 --> 02:07:19,577
You were in on that too,
weren't you, Smokey?

1845
02:07:19,647 --> 02:07:23,879
<i>- How 'bout these putos? You know 'em, don't you?
- No. No way.</i>

1846
02:07:23,952 --> 02:07:27,683
La Onda? Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1847
02:07:27,755 --> 02:07:29,746
Isn't that what
that snake tattoo means?

1848
02:07:29,824 --> 02:07:32,054
I don't know what the fuck
you're talkin' about, ese.

1849
02:07:32,126 --> 02:07:34,253
<i>I'll tell you what
I'm talking about, pendejo.</i>

1850
02:07:34,329 --> 02:07:37,321
You're a two-time loser, Smokey. One
more, they're gonna lock you up for good.

1851
02:07:37,398 --> 02:07:40,128
So you better tell me about Onda, or
I'm gonna strap you down with a bitch.

1852
02:07:40,201 --> 02:07:42,328
You'll never see
the streets again!

1853
02:07:42,403 --> 02:07:46,806
If I say anything, I'm dead meat.
I ain't gonna tell you shit, ese!

1854
02:07:50,011 --> 02:07:52,878
[Grunts]

1855
02:07:57,485 --> 02:08:01,182
<i>It's baby powder, baboso!</i>

1856
02:08:01,255 --> 02:08:03,314
You write down
every word I say.

1857
02:08:03,391 --> 02:08:08,158
Anything you don't understand, you ask.
I will answer just once, so write it down.

1858
02:08:08,229 --> 02:08:12,029
Precedents for habeas corpus,
cruel and unusual punishment here.

1859
02:08:12,100 --> 02:08:14,534
You're also allowed to help
on Durham decree.

1860
02:08:14,602 --> 02:08:16,763
How much can you
charge for this?

1861
02:08:16,838 --> 02:08:19,363
You gotta know what you're
talkin' about first.

1862
02:08:19,440 --> 02:08:21,874
You do your homework,
jailhouse lawyer...

1863
02:08:21,943 --> 02:08:25,003
can make as much as
any mid-level attorney on the street.

1864
02:08:25,079 --> 02:08:27,206
I'm gonna live
in here.

1865
02:08:28,616 --> 02:08:32,552
- Jerry, I don't mean to be nosy, but l...
- Then don't be.

1866
02:08:34,656 --> 02:08:37,386
All right, what?
What is it?

1867
02:08:37,458 --> 02:08:40,052
I'm just
wonderin', uh...

1868
02:08:40,128 --> 02:08:42,562
You own all those
hardware stores.

1869
02:08:42,630 --> 02:08:44,996
How come
you're in here?

1870
02:08:46,367 --> 02:08:49,427
Eleven tons of Colombian weed,
twelve keys of heroin...

1871
02:08:49,504 --> 02:08:52,302
and a pilot that turned
state's evidence.

1872
02:08:53,341 --> 02:08:57,368
<i> Chingao! Big time.</i>

1873
02:08:57,445 --> 02:09:00,107
- Hey, Jer, I just want you to handle my ca...
- Hurry up, Jerry.

1874
02:09:00,181 --> 02:09:03,082
Charlie. I didn't see your jacket here.
You got an appointment?

1875
02:09:03,151 --> 02:09:05,676
<i>The name's Carlos. Remember, I'm
paying you lot of feria, ese.</i>

1876
02:09:05,753 --> 02:09:08,244
- Make an appointment, Charlie.
- You should be working on my case overtime.

1877
02:09:08,322 --> 02:09:11,780
Charlie, cool out or get out.
George? Table.

1878
02:09:14,095 --> 02:09:19,863
<i>Oye, Miklo. You could take your leg off and
hook down some of the books from up top, ese.</i>

1879
02:09:19,934 --> 02:09:24,928
<i>Hey, I'm just kidding, ese.
Come here. Oye, come here, man.</i>

1880
02:09:25,006 --> 02:09:29,636
<i>Hey, relax. I got the medicine
to make you well, vato. Mira.</i>

1881
02:09:29,711 --> 02:09:33,272
<i>If you're ever in any pain, homey, you
just come talk to me. Me entiendes?</i>

1882
02:09:35,416 --> 02:09:37,384
<i>- You should talk to El Mero Mero.
- Chale.</i>

1883
02:09:37,452 --> 02:09:40,944
Think about the future, not the past.
Montana's not God.

1884
02:09:41,189 --> 02:09:44,955
<i>[Carlos] Tomorrow at the council I'm giving
Onda a chance to move into the driver's seat.</i>

1885
02:09:45,025 --> 02:09:47,152
<i>Don't be
left behind, eh?</i>

1886
02:09:47,227 --> 02:09:51,061
<i>Mira. I cut a sweet deal
with the AV-ers.</i>

1887
02:09:51,131 --> 02:09:53,929
<i>They'll supply me
with all the dope I can move...</i>

1888
02:09:54,001 --> 02:09:56,834
just as long as I sell
only to the blacks and the browns.

1889
02:09:58,205 --> 02:10:02,437
What do you have to give
in return to the polar bears?

1890
02:10:04,177 --> 02:10:06,805
I gotta plug up
the B.G.A. Pipeline.

1891
02:10:06,880 --> 02:10:08,814
Take 'em outta
the dope business.

1892
02:10:11,518 --> 02:10:15,978
<i>It's simple. Me and my soldados
can take care of Pockets in here.</i>

1893
02:10:16,056 --> 02:10:19,514
<i>My brother Smokey can take out Cheap
Times, their main supply joint in L.A.</i>

1894
02:10:19,593 --> 02:10:22,619
All I need from the council
is backup.

1895
02:10:22,696 --> 02:10:27,895
- In return, I'm prepared to give Onda a third of my profit.
- It's a sucker's deal, ese.

1896
02:10:29,770 --> 02:10:34,002
The only thing the Aryans want is
to start a war between black and brown.

1897
02:10:34,074 --> 02:10:36,065
<i>Chale. We've got
a truce with the B.G.A.</i>

1898
02:10:36,143 --> 02:10:39,442
<i>Why do you wanna play
the chimp with these mayates?</i>

1899
02:10:39,513 --> 02:10:41,981
The market is there.

1900
02:10:42,049 --> 02:10:45,212
Cocaine is America's
cup of coffee.

1901
02:10:47,654 --> 02:10:50,214
<i>Oye, check it out.</i>

1902
02:10:50,290 --> 02:10:52,224
<i>I'm making so much feria
right now,</i>

1903
02:10:52,292 --> 02:10:55,455
it's making Miklo's gambling book
look like bubble gum change!

1904
02:10:55,529 --> 02:10:58,726
We don't start wars
to become dope pushers.

1905
02:10:58,799 --> 02:11:01,495
<i>You even addicted some of
our own soldados to coca.</i>

1906
02:11:01,568 --> 02:11:06,062
We're supposed to protect
our people, not destroy them.

1907
02:11:06,139 --> 02:11:09,666
Look at his arms. He loves
that shit more than he loves us.

1908
02:11:09,743 --> 02:11:13,304
<i>- He'll destroy La Onda.
-  Ya! Enough words.</i>

1909
02:11:13,380 --> 02:11:17,476
We've come all this way. You wanna
go back to bumming cigarettes, ese?

1910
02:11:17,551 --> 02:11:21,009
<i>- Oye, you wanna shine shoes?
- Ese, La Onda don't shine shoes.</i>

1911
02:11:21,088 --> 02:11:24,080
That's right, but that's what's gonna
happen if we don't make our move now.

1912
02:11:24,157 --> 02:11:27,718
I wanna own the whole fuckin' store!
Now are you with me?

1913
02:11:27,794 --> 02:11:30,922
<i>I say chale.
You're not the leader here.</i>

1914
02:11:30,998 --> 02:11:32,898
<i>I say Onda's
not with you.</i>

1915
02:11:32,966 --> 02:11:35,059
You do what you
have to do without us.

1916
02:11:44,978 --> 02:11:47,913
'Cause I ain't goin' back.

1917
02:11:49,583 --> 02:11:51,881
I don't need Onda for this.

1918
02:11:51,952 --> 02:11:55,353
Money buys my backup.

1919
02:11:55,422 --> 02:11:58,482
I'll get the polar bears
to back my play.

1920
02:12:01,495 --> 02:12:03,588
<i>- Oye, adonde vas, Jose?
- I split, eh.</i>

1921
02:12:03,663 --> 02:12:05,756
<i>- Hey, carnal.
- No, ese.</i>

1922
02:12:09,736 --> 02:12:13,695
<i>Carlos, come back!
Jefe, we can't let him go.</i>

1923
02:12:13,774 --> 02:12:16,470
We can't let him
split up Onda. Carlos!

1924
02:12:16,543 --> 02:12:19,910
<i>[Jerry] Can't you see Montana's
stupid for letting Charlie walk?</i>

1925
02:12:19,980 --> 02:12:22,005
<i>- Onda's committing suicide.
- Fuck you, Jerry!</i>

1926
02:12:22,082 --> 02:12:24,209
Fine. I thought you wanted
to learn something.

1927
02:12:27,421 --> 02:12:29,355
Listen, Charlie's
a businessman.

1928
02:12:29,423 --> 02:12:31,357
He broke some serious
business rules.

1929
02:12:31,425 --> 02:12:33,655
Not only did he get strung out
on his own shit,

1930
02:12:33,727 --> 02:12:36,457
but he moved on B.G.A. Clients
when he didn't have to.

1931
02:12:36,530 --> 02:12:38,464
- Is that right?
- Yeah, that's right.

1932
02:12:38,532 --> 02:12:41,296
I see the jackets of most
of the cons that come in here.

1933
02:12:41,368 --> 02:12:44,269
Eighty percent of them...
eighty percent of them are drug cases.

1934
02:12:44,337 --> 02:12:46,862
You know why?
Because everybody out there's doin' it.

1935
02:12:46,940 --> 02:12:48,999
Doctors, lawyers,
housewives.

1936
02:12:49,076 --> 02:12:51,510
Cocaine is
America's cup of coffee.

1937
02:12:55,816 --> 02:12:58,080
You were Carlos' connection.

1938
02:12:58,151 --> 02:13:02,952
<i>He said the same "cup of coffee"line
exactly. You were supplying him.</i>

1939
02:13:03,023 --> 02:13:06,015
<i>You're pissed 'cause he's
doing business with AV-ers now.</i>

1940
02:13:06,093 --> 02:13:09,551
Last year, California passed
a flat-time law for drug offenders.

1941
02:13:09,629 --> 02:13:12,154
You know what that means? That means
they have it worse than anybody...

1942
02:13:12,232 --> 02:13:14,223
murderers, rapists,
anybody.

1943
02:13:14,301 --> 02:13:16,599
There's no parole,
no good time.

1944
02:13:16,670 --> 02:13:20,800
That's a lot of guys that are gonna be
here for a real long time, all drug users.

1945
02:13:20,874 --> 02:13:22,808
Can you see
the potential?

1946
02:13:22,876 --> 02:13:24,867
- Can you?
- Yeah.

1947
02:13:24,945 --> 02:13:27,004
Anyone who can accommodate
that appetite...

1948
02:13:27,080 --> 02:13:30,538
can control this joint
and every other joint.

1949
02:13:30,617 --> 02:13:32,517
Dwell on it.

1950
02:13:39,793 --> 02:13:42,626
[Lightning] Drive it.
Drive it, Ryder.

1951
02:13:42,696 --> 02:13:45,028
Here's your pill briefs.

1952
02:13:45,098 --> 02:13:48,625
Jerry said it will take at least
three months for the court to respond.

1953
02:13:48,702 --> 02:13:51,227
Well, well, well,
Lightning.

1954
02:13:51,304 --> 02:13:54,364
<i>Our favorite spic lover has come home.
I knew he'd be back.</i>

1955
02:13:54,441 --> 02:14:00,209
Here's your file. Magic said to remind you
about Lightning's account. It's overdue.

1956
02:14:00,280 --> 02:14:04,876
You hear that, Lightning? The cripple
here wants to collect your gambling debts.

1957
02:14:06,620 --> 02:14:10,283
Yeah, well, I might think about it,
if he'll show me his falsie.

1958
02:14:11,625 --> 02:14:13,388
Come on, cripple,
show me your stump.

1959
02:14:13,460 --> 02:14:15,894
<i>[Ryder] Little white Mexican boy...</i>

1960
02:14:15,962 --> 02:14:17,987
came all the way back
just to show us his stump.

1961
02:14:18,064 --> 02:14:21,556
- Hold his fuckin' leg! Come on. Stand still.
- Get off me, motherfuckers!

1962
02:14:21,635 --> 02:14:24,536
Too many britches on.
Stay still, goddamn it, I said!

1963
02:14:24,604 --> 02:14:26,834
You gotta be crazy to pull
this shit, Lightning!

1964
02:14:26,907 --> 02:14:28,841
Ooh, I'm scared, punk.

1965
02:14:28,909 --> 02:14:31,742
<i>I'll bet you didn't fight so hard when
Big Al used to do this, did you?</i>

1966
02:14:31,811 --> 02:14:33,676
He must be laughin'
in his grave, cripple.

1967
02:14:33,747 --> 02:14:36,341
Get off, you fuck...
No, leave it alone!

1968
02:14:36,416 --> 02:14:39,249
Stay still,
goddamn it.

1969
02:14:39,319 --> 02:14:43,779
<i>- Oh! There she is.
- Fucking puto!</i>

1970
02:14:43,857 --> 02:14:47,486
You ever heard that old saying,
"Put your foot in your mouth"?

1971
02:14:49,429 --> 02:14:52,091
Spit-shine that shoe, boy.

1972
02:14:54,201 --> 02:14:58,194
- You fuckin' polar bears are gonna pay, believe me!
- [Ryder Spits]

1973
02:14:58,271 --> 02:15:01,866
Look around you, half-breed.
Onda's finished!

1974
02:15:01,942 --> 02:15:03,876
Carlos works for us now,

1975
02:15:03,944 --> 02:15:06,538
and every day he brings
more Onda soldiers with him.

1976
02:15:06,613 --> 02:15:09,810
You greasers better wise up.
It's a white world.

1977
02:15:09,883 --> 02:15:12,545
<i>The coloreds are here
to serve us.</i>

1978
02:15:12,619 --> 02:15:16,385
From now on, you're gonna be
my personal errand boy.

1979
02:15:17,824 --> 02:15:20,816
- You motherfucker!
- Fuckin' punk!

1980
02:15:20,894 --> 02:15:24,386
Go out for a pass, cripple.
Come on, go deep.

1981
02:15:29,236 --> 02:15:31,295
[Laughter]

1982
02:15:33,039 --> 02:15:35,371
Now you're back to
your true nature, boy.

1983
02:15:35,442 --> 02:15:39,139
<i>- Crawling on your belly like a worm.
- [Laughter]</i>

1984
02:15:40,447 --> 02:15:42,381
They put it in my face!

1985
02:15:42,449 --> 02:15:46,351
You have to understand. Your leg is gone,
Miklo. You can no longer be a soldier.

1986
02:15:46,419 --> 02:15:48,353
That's why I put you
in the library.

1987
02:15:48,421 --> 02:15:51,447
It's not what they did to me.
They got no respect for Onda.

1988
02:15:51,524 --> 02:15:53,515
We should never have
given up Carlos.

1989
02:15:53,593 --> 02:15:57,893
You think I wanted to?
Carlos fucked up, bad!

1990
02:15:57,964 --> 02:16:00,831
I'm not saying he didn't,
but he was right about the drugs.

1991
02:16:00,900 --> 02:16:02,868
Whoever controls them
controls everything.

1992
02:16:02,936 --> 02:16:05,871
You ever seen an old drug dealer,
Miklo? They don't exist.

1993
02:16:05,939 --> 02:16:08,203
Look, all we have
to do is wait.

1994
02:16:08,274 --> 02:16:11,710
<i>In five years, Chicanos are gonna be the
majority in the pintas in the Southwest.</i>

1995
02:16:11,778 --> 02:16:13,905
This is now,
not five years from now!

1996
02:16:13,980 --> 02:16:17,939
What good is it if we're a bunch of fuckin'
slaves workin' for the B.G.A. And AV-ers?

1997
02:16:18,017 --> 02:16:20,042
We gotta attack now!
We gotta take power!

1998
02:16:20,120 --> 02:16:22,816
All we ever been doing is fighting
each other! And for what?

1999
02:16:22,889 --> 02:16:24,880
The best of us ending up
in pools of blood...

2000
02:16:24,958 --> 02:16:27,256
<i>for a pinche pack of smokes
and a snort of coca!</i>

2001
02:16:27,327 --> 02:16:29,727
<i> Chale!</i>

2002
02:16:29,796 --> 02:16:32,731
I don't know where
you're comin' from, bro.

2003
02:16:38,104 --> 02:16:40,163
<i>Que es eso?</i>

2004
02:16:41,841 --> 02:16:47,040
A Chicana from Cal State got them
to publish my essay on prison reform.

2005
02:16:48,581 --> 02:16:52,540
They want me to write a book
on the Chicano in prison.

2006
02:16:56,156 --> 02:16:59,091
<i>You better lift your eyes
outta this book, Jefe.</i>

2007
02:16:59,159 --> 02:17:01,889
You better see what's
goin' on around us now.

2008
02:17:07,734 --> 02:17:12,194
<i>Wind it up, gentlemen. Take it
to your houses. Let's go, move it.</i>

2009
02:17:12,272 --> 02:17:14,365
<i>[Magic] Hey, Bonafide! When's
the B.G.A. Gonna take care of its tab?</i>

2010
02:17:14,440 --> 02:17:16,601
<i>No can do, carnal.</i>

2011
02:17:18,878 --> 02:17:20,846
Quarter of the bill
I can take care of, maybe.

2012
02:17:20,914 --> 02:17:23,212
<i>Indugu. You forgot
your comb, man.</i>

2013
02:17:24,817 --> 02:17:26,842
Maybe.

2014
02:17:28,588 --> 02:17:31,421
Thinks he's getting away with something.
He's holding on to a fairy tale.

2015
02:17:31,491 --> 02:17:34,585
<i>-  Pinche mayate!
- Hey, Magic.</i>

2016
02:17:34,661 --> 02:17:36,629
<i>Help me out.</i>

2017
02:17:36,696 --> 02:17:41,463
<i>[Indistinct Chatter]</i>

2018
02:17:49,742 --> 02:17:52,233
<i>[Inmate] You mad-dog me,
you better watch your back, homes!</i>

2019
02:17:52,312 --> 02:17:55,543
Now the fuckin' AV-ers
won't pay on their bets either.

2020
02:17:55,615 --> 02:17:59,608
Why pay? They were testing us
with Carlos and we folded.

2021
02:17:59,686 --> 02:18:01,711
Now they're gonna take us
apart piece by piece.

2022
02:18:06,759 --> 02:18:10,092
Whether we like it or not, the dope
business is where it's at, Magic.

2023
02:18:10,163 --> 02:18:15,100
If the AV-ers and the BGA-ers control
it, they control everything, including us.

2024
02:18:15,168 --> 02:18:17,932
Fuckin' A, ese.
Carlitos was right.

Why don't you kiss my enriched
white ass, motherfucker?

2181
02:29:38,151 --> 02:29:40,483
<i>This here's my coon dog.
Get them coons, boy.</i>

2182
02:29:40,553 --> 02:29:43,078
[Barking]

2183
02:29:43,156 --> 02:29:45,090
Hey, Ryder!
What's goin' on?

2184
02:29:45,158 --> 02:29:49,458
Don't ask me what's goin' on! Ask,
"What are we doin' here? Is there a war?"

2185
02:29:49,529 --> 02:29:52,521
<i>[Ryder] Run 'em outta the goddamn
banks! Save the taxpayers some money!</i>

2186
02:29:52,598 --> 02:29:55,294
All right, gentlemen,
let's clear the yard!

2187
02:29:55,368 --> 02:29:57,393
[Ryder] It's between
the niggers and the spics!

2188
02:29:57,470 --> 02:29:59,461
We're white, white,
white, you motherfuckers!

2189
02:29:59,539 --> 02:30:02,201
<i>[Miklo] Jefe, will Bonafide
listen to me?</i>

2190
02:30:02,275 --> 02:30:04,209
Magic and the others
are warriors.

2191
02:30:04,277 --> 02:30:07,337
If I put one of them in charge,
Bonafide would never trust me.

2192
02:30:07,413 --> 02:30:10,143
You're a jailhouse lawyer,
a counselor.

2193
02:30:10,216 --> 02:30:13,310
- He knows you'll follow my wishes.
- But what if he's lying?

2194
02:30:13,386 --> 02:30:15,854
What if the B.G.A.
Doesn't want peace?

2195
02:30:15,922 --> 02:30:19,153
Nobody in here knows what peace is.
They've never had it.

2196
02:30:19,225 --> 02:30:22,388
<i>I'm talking
about power, carnal.</i>

2197
02:30:22,462 --> 02:30:26,523
The only way for us to gain real power
is for black and brown to come together.

2198
02:30:26,599 --> 02:30:29,693
<i>Me entiendes?</i>

2199
02:30:29,769 --> 02:30:33,205
<i>[Paco] Huh. And I thought Popeye
Savedra was the leader of Onda.</i>

2200
02:30:33,272 --> 02:30:36,298
It's hard to buy it's
that little guy down there.

2201
02:30:36,375 --> 02:30:39,276
You better believe it.

2202
02:30:39,345 --> 02:30:41,813
He's got what you
call "charisma."

2203
02:30:41,881 --> 02:30:44,907
You really think he can do something
to stop the violence?

2204
02:30:44,984 --> 02:30:48,385
<i>Montana's got something that makes you
wanna listen to him. He's got a lot of heart.</i>

2205
02:30:48,454 --> 02:30:50,979
If anybody can stop
this war, it's him.

2206
02:30:51,057 --> 02:30:54,493
I can always bring in the guns,
but I'd rather it be him.

2207
02:30:54,560 --> 02:30:56,551
I don't like you
traveling alone.

2208
02:30:56,629 --> 02:30:59,826
I don't trust the administration.
I don't trust anybody.

2209
02:30:59,899 --> 02:31:03,926
Don't worry. The warden's
guaranteeing my passage.

2210
02:31:04,003 --> 02:31:07,996
<i>Top secret route.
Oye.</i>

2211
02:31:09,442 --> 02:31:12,309
I made a deal
with the vato.

2212
02:31:12,378 --> 02:31:16,644
I get to spend the night in Delano,
see my daughter.

2213
02:31:18,985 --> 02:31:23,046
After 14 years.
Can you believe it?

2214
02:31:23,122 --> 02:31:24,987
<i>Come on, Segura.</i>

2215
02:31:25,057 --> 02:31:26,490
Move it.

2216
02:31:30,229 --> 02:31:32,356
<i>Jefe.</i>

2217
02:31:33,900 --> 02:31:36,232
<i>Huacha. You tell
those vatos...</i>

2218
02:31:36,302 --> 02:31:39,465
<i>to find some shade and chill out
'til I get back, eh?</i>

2219
02:31:39,539 --> 02:31:41,473
You got it.

2220
02:31:47,647 --> 02:31:49,911
<i>[Montana] What time's
my daughter coming?</i>

2221
02:31:49,982 --> 02:31:52,542
She'll be here
about 7:00 sharp.

2222
02:32:06,699 --> 02:32:10,692
- We'll rack you at 6:00 tomorrow for a shower.
- I'll be waiting.

2223
02:32:15,274 --> 02:32:19,677
<i>- Psst! Name's Wallace.
- Montana.</i>

2224
02:32:19,745 --> 02:32:23,579
Say, amigo, you ain't got
no street smokes, do ya?

2225
02:32:23,649 --> 02:32:25,776
<i>This state tobacco, man,
it'll kill ya.</i>

2226
02:32:25,851 --> 02:32:27,876
I don't smoke.

2227
02:32:29,221 --> 02:32:31,451
You don't smoke, huh?

2228
02:32:31,524 --> 02:32:35,119
Man, I can't wait for these
son-of-a-bitches to let me outta here...

2229
02:32:35,194 --> 02:32:37,492
<i>so I can find me
a field crew.</i>

2230
02:32:37,563 --> 02:32:41,021
Do me some pickin' so I can send my old
lady some money back in Louisiana.

2231
02:32:42,535 --> 02:32:45,868
<i>- Yeah, I used to pick a little when I was a kid.
- Huh.</i>

2232
02:32:45,938 --> 02:32:48,702
Me, I been followin'
this crop all my life.

2233
02:32:48,774 --> 02:32:51,038
If it ain't that,
I takes me a little drink.

2234
02:32:51,110 --> 02:32:55,547
<i>If it ain't that, they got me
behind bars tryin'to dry out.</i>

2235
02:32:58,351 --> 02:33:00,546
You ever pick
any grapes, Wallace?

2236
02:33:00,620 --> 02:33:03,282
[Laughing]

2237
02:33:03,356 --> 02:33:07,190
No, I ain't never picked no grapes.
But I done cut me a bunch.

2238
02:33:09,562 --> 02:33:11,621
Yeah.

2239
02:33:20,473 --> 02:33:22,668
- Here.
- Oh, man, thank you.

2240
02:33:26,712 --> 02:33:30,148
Is it... Say, amigo, d-do you mind
any if I have two?

2241
02:33:30,216 --> 02:33:33,117
- Ah, keep the pack. They're only for trade.
- Oh, man.

2242
02:33:33,185 --> 02:33:36,643
<i>[Guard] Lights out.</i>

2243
02:33:36,722 --> 02:33:40,920
<i>You know, when I was a kid,
I used to love to pick.</i>

2244
02:33:42,662 --> 02:33:47,759
Nothing like fresh vegetables
and fruit right from the vine.

2245
02:33:50,269 --> 02:33:53,568
Yeah.
Hmm.

2246
02:34:02,148 --> 02:34:05,549
Okay, the escort's on his way.
You'll have one hour with your father.

2247
02:34:05,618 --> 02:34:08,086
- Let's go.
- I'd like a couple of seconds to straighten up.

2248
02:34:08,153 --> 02:34:11,054
I don't care who you are in San Quentin.
You're nobody here in Kern County.

2249
02:34:11,123 --> 02:34:13,921
<i>Look, officer. I haven't seen
my daughter in 14 years.</i>

2250
02:34:13,992 --> 02:34:16,927
Could I just take a couple of seconds
to straighten up?

2251
02:34:16,995 --> 02:34:19,020
Please?

2252
02:34:23,769 --> 02:34:27,671
<i>I'm gonna put your daughter in the
visiting room. You've got one hour.</i>

2253
02:34:27,740 --> 02:34:31,335
The clock is ticking.
One hour. Be right back.

2254
02:34:35,013 --> 02:34:37,880
Mornin', Montana.

2255
02:34:37,950 --> 02:34:40,612
Morning, Wallace.

2256
02:34:40,686 --> 02:34:43,849
See they botherin' with ya
early in the mornin', huh?

2257
02:34:45,691 --> 02:34:48,922
No. It's a good day.

2258
02:34:48,994 --> 02:34:51,827
I'm not gonna let
anything ruin it.

2259
02:34:51,897 --> 02:34:56,061
Aaah! Ooh, them damn
short-handle holes!

2260
02:34:56,135 --> 02:34:58,330
Yeah, I used to
feel those myself.

2261
02:34:58,404 --> 02:35:00,770
Oh... Oh!

2262
02:35:02,307 --> 02:35:05,367
Here, amigo.
Why don't you use this?

2263
02:35:07,312 --> 02:35:09,371
Yeah, well,
I'll hold it for you.

2264
02:35:12,251 --> 02:35:14,412
Thank you.

2265

- Yeah.

2268
02:35:23,262 --> 02:35:25,253
Your daughter's
gonna be so proud of you.

<i>- Daaah!
- You can go join your maker now.</i>

2276

- No! Stop him!

02:36:58,090 --> 02:37:01,025
No! They're waiting for us

<i>And I'm gonna stay that way! And I
want mi familia to stay that way too!</i>

Wait and be ready,
Magic!

2289
02:37:22,214 --> 02:37:25,775
Again. How'd you know
he was in Delano?

How'd you know the head
of La Onda was there?

Nope. He's been in
for 30 years.

2297
02:37:47,039 --> 02:37:49,837
He's as tough
as three-inch steel.

- I didn't order no hit on nobody.

- No way!

He ain't gonna
tell you nothin'.

You wanna get to the bottom of this
problem? You wanna deal with it?

Oh, I dig. The Man got
his eyes and ears in the wall.

Don't sweat, brother.
I'm gonna maintain.

You did.

<i>The warden let me come in here
to talk to you about Montana's murder.</i>

2337
02:40:18,323 --> 02:40:20,621
Who the fuck are you
to come here like this?

2338
02:40:20,692 --> 02:40:22,990
Montana's none of
your fucking business!

2339
02:40:23,061 --> 02:40:25,222
You gotta listen to me, Miklo.

2340
02:40:25,297 --> 02:40:27,322
Bonafide says somebody
counterfeited his comb...

2341
02:40:27,399 --> 02:40:29,629
and put a phony message
in it to hit Montana.

2342
02:40:29,701 --> 02:40:32,670
- The B.G.A. Didn't do it.
- That's bullshit!

2343
02:40:32,738 --> 02:40:34,672
We know the fuckin' B.G.A.
Killed him.

2344
02:40:34,740 --> 02:40:37,971
Yeah? Well, the administration doesn't
think so. And what if they're right?

2345
02:40:38,043 --> 02:40:42,878
You wanna be responsible for starting a
fucking war against the wrong people? Huh?

2346
02:40:44,382 --> 02:40:46,680
Listen, man,
I know you hate me.

2347
02:40:46,752 --> 02:40:50,347
I shot your leg off, and that's something I'm
gonna have to live with for the rest of my life.

2348
02:40:50,422 --> 02:40:55,086
But you're still my blood, and I'm not gonna
stand here and watch you destroy yourself.

2349
02:40:55,160 --> 02:40:59,290
If you start this war, you and
your vatos will be committing suicide.

2350
02:40:59,364 --> 02:41:01,355
Now look over there.
You see the warden?

2351
02:41:01,433 --> 02:41:05,335
<i>He's got all the firepower he needs, and
he ain't afraid to use it, believe me.</i>

2352
02:41:05,403 --> 02:41:07,564
Do you want that?

2353
02:41:09,841 --> 02:41:12,275
Oh, you're The Man now,
aren't you?

2354
02:41:12,344 --> 02:41:14,972
Look, Montana left you
in charge, right?

2355
02:41:15,046 --> 02:41:17,606
Be a real leader, man.
Protect your people.

2356
02:41:17,682 --> 02:41:20,150
Meet with Bonafide.
What do you got to lose?

2357
02:41:26,057 --> 02:41:28,025
I'll meet him in the yard.

2358
02:41:28,226 --> 02:41:31,821
<i>[Miklo] One lieutenant each.
No guards around.</i>

2359
02:41:31,896 --> 02:41:34,831
[Warden] That's far enough.
Let 'em go on their own.

2360
02:41:44,909 --> 02:41:48,310
I swear to you,
it wasn't the B.G.A.

2361
02:41:48,379 --> 02:41:51,371
Montana was a stand-up dude.
We were set up!

2362
02:41:51,449 --> 02:41:54,509
That old man was no jive-ass punk.
He was hard-core B.G.A.

2363
02:41:54,585 --> 02:41:57,748
That's right. That's why
it don't make no sense.

2364
02:41:57,822 --> 02:42:01,588
I take out Montana with my own man?
That's suicide.

2365
02:42:01,659 --> 02:42:06,358
Now you do what you wanna do,
but think about this:

2366
02:42:06,430 --> 02:42:10,389
Who you think stands to gain
if B.G.A. And Onda war?

2367
02:42:10,468 --> 02:42:13,494
The fuckin' A.V.!

2368
02:42:13,571 --> 02:42:15,596
<i>Oh, yeah, they want us
to take each other out.</i>

2369
02:42:15,673 --> 02:42:19,905
Then they step in and take over
everything. We go back to bein' slaves.

2370
02:42:19,977 --> 02:42:23,105
The AV-ers.

2371
02:42:23,180 --> 02:42:27,674
They're the only ones who could've gotten
Montana's route from the white guards. Right?

2372
02:42:27,752 --> 02:42:29,947
I work with Lightning
in the wood shop.

2373
02:42:30,021 --> 02:42:35,425
He gets my comb, he counterfeits it,
he sends it to Wallace.

2374
02:42:37,228 --> 02:42:40,129
<i>- It's possible.
- And now that motherfucker Red Ryder...</i>

2375
02:42:40,197 --> 02:42:43,792
sittin' in a front-row seat just waitin'
on us to take each other out.

2376
02:42:43,868 --> 02:42:48,328
- So what do you propose?
- I say whip those motherfuckers together.

2377
02:42:48,406 --> 02:42:50,897
We do to them
what they tryin' to do to us.

2378
02:42:54,378 --> 02:42:56,312
<i>[Miklo] You see those
pinche vultures?</i>

2379
02:42:56,380 --> 02:42:59,645
They're watchin' us with
a magnifying glass right now.

2380
02:43:01,252 --> 02:43:04,983
So for the next six months,
we'll practice a good-neighbor policy.

2381
02:43:06,590 --> 02:43:09,081
So we got a deal?
We join forces?

2382
02:43:09,160 --> 02:43:11,185
Yeah.

2383
02:43:11,262 --> 02:43:14,322
And we'll celebrate a big
Mexican holiday together.

2384
02:43:14,398 --> 02:43:17,128
Now which one
you talkin' about?

2385
02:43:17,201 --> 02:43:19,101
<i>Dia de los muertos.</i>

2386
02:43:19,170 --> 02:43:20,899
That means what now?

2387
02:43:20,971 --> 02:43:22,996
Day of the Dead.

2388
02:43:25,176 --> 02:43:28,942
- All right.
- [Chuckles] Right.

2389
02:43:32,883 --> 02:43:34,976
In six months.

2390
02:43:35,052 --> 02:43:36,986
My man.

2391
02:43:37,054 --> 02:43:39,147
They're shakin' hands.
We got a truce.

2392
02:43:39,223 --> 02:43:42,317
We won't congratulate ourselves
too soon. We'll wait and see.

2393
02:43:47,098 --> 02:43:49,532
<i>[Cyclone]
I don't trust that dude.</i>

2394
02:43:49,600 --> 02:43:51,761
No, no, no.
This boy's in way over his head.

2395
02:43:51,836 --> 02:43:54,270
He ain't got no choice
but to go with us right now.

2396
02:43:54,338 --> 02:43:58,104
<i>We help them take out the AV-ers,
we're making the mayates stronger, ese.</i>

2397
02:43:58,175 --> 02:44:00,166
<i>It's okay, carnal.</i>

2398
02:44:00,244 --> 02:44:03,873
When you expect nothing and you get
everything, that's destiny.

2399
02:44:03,948 --> 02:44:08,715
The B.G.A. Wants to help us take out
the AV-ers? All right.

2400
02:44:08,786 --> 02:44:11,084
We'll throw a little
white meat to the dogs.

2401
02:44:11,155 --> 02:44:13,123
Then we'll rob
the house.

2402
02:44:18,562 --> 02:44:20,086
<i> Orale!</i>

2403
02:44:33,210 --> 02:44:35,371
<i>Gracias, carnal.
You were right.</i>

2404
02:44:35,446 --> 02:44:37,710
You did the right
thing, Miklo.

2405
02:44:37,781 --> 02:44:39,715
Tell your mom
I love her, okay?

2406
02:44:39,783 --> 02:44:41,876
- Take care of yourself, all right?
- Yeah.

The plan's
gonna work, Bonafide.

2439
02:49:12,172 --> 02:49:14,333
I'm telling you, man,
we keep our stake together.

2440
02:49:14,408 --> 02:49:16,899
- That way we control the whole joint, right?
- All right.

[Warden] Who do these punks
think they are? Look at this!

2444
02:50:09,196 --> 02:50:12,632
It's unbelievable.
Every hit was strategic.

2445
02:50:12,699 --> 02:50:15,259
First they knocked off
most of the A.V. Leadership,

2446
02:50:15,335 --> 02:50:17,303
and then they
finished off the B.G.A.

2447
02:50:17,371 --> 02:50:21,330

God and he's got an army to back him up.

<i>Yeah, I don't understand, right?
I don't ever understand, right?</i>

2454
02:50:42,863 --> 02:50:46,663
Well, as long as he's doing it behind bars,
it's not gonna affect you or me, is it?

<i>- Is it?
- Oh, it's not gonna affect us?</i>

2456

Won't affect

2457
02:51:19,399 --> 02:51:21,526
You used me.

2458
02:51:21,602 --> 02:51:24,901
I tried to save your life and you
used me to set up the B.G.A.

2459

Man, you grew up with me.

2462
02:51:35,649 --> 02:51:39,380
You slept in my room.
You wore my fuckin' clothes!

2463
02:51:39,453 --> 02:51:43,514
How could you use your own flesh and
blood to help massacre all those people?

2464
02:51:43,590 --> 02:51:47,720
I didn't wanna hurt you, Paco.
In here, you use what you've got.

2467
02:51:53,634 --> 02:51:55,602
I hate what you did.

2468
02:51:55,669 --> 02:51:57,728
I hate what
you stand for.

2469
02:51:59,907 --> 02:52:03,206
You know, Paquito,
for a long time I hated you.

2470
02:52:04,711 --> 02:52:07,544
I blamed you for everything.

2471
02:52:07,614 --> 02:52:10,515
But then I realized something
that changed my life.

2472
02:52:11,919 --> 02:52:15,912
Everything you did...
even shooting my leg off...

2473
02:52:15,989 --> 02:52:18,219
forced me into my destiny.

2474
02:52:18,292 --> 02:52:20,453
Made me discover myself.

2475
02:52:20,527 --> 02:52:23,428
Find my real family,
my home.

2476
02:52:23,497 --> 02:52:25,431

<i>You got no fuckin' idea

2479
02:52:33,240 --> 02:52:39,145
<i>It's about our people out there, working,
surviving, with pride and dignity. That's raza.</i>

2480
02:52:39,212 --> 02:52:42,613
Not lying and murdering.

2481
02:52:42,683 --> 02:52:44,981
All you got is
your white father's hate.

2482
02:52:46,987 --> 02:52:50,787
Still hung up on my
fluorescent skin, vato? Hmm?

2483
02:52:51,992 --> 02:52:54,017
He wasn't my real father.

2484
02:52:54,094 --> 02:52:58,190
Montana was.
He taught me about respect.

2485
02:52:58,265 --> 02:53:00,256
<i>You gotta be willing
to die for it.</i>

2486
02:53:00,334 --> 02:53:04,862
Like you. Like you not deserting me
after the car crash at El Pino.

2487
02:53:04,938 --> 02:53:06,963
That was real respect
for a brother.

2488
02:53:09,209 --> 02:53:11,973
<i>And I'll always
love you for it, carnal.</i>

2489
02:53:12,045 --> 02:53:15,640
Miklo, it's not about drive-bys
and gang fights anymore.

2490
02:53:15,716 --> 02:53:19,117
<i>- It's about...
- Let's stop fighting, carnal! We're family.</i>

2491
02:53:19,186 --> 02:53:22,121
We should help each other,
not cut each other's throats.

2492
02:53:26,126 --> 02:53:28,321
Let's be brothers again.

2493
02:53:30,731 --> 02:53:32,665
[Sighs]

2494
02:53:34,735 --> 02:53:39,104
Just because you're a cop and I'm a con
doesn't mean we can't cooperate.

2495
02:53:41,241 --> 02:53:45,200
I can give you tips from inside that
could really help you out on the street.

2496
02:53:47,848 --> 02:53:50,783
You got a lot of power
out there, man.

2497
02:53:50,851 --> 02:53:54,685
Your guidance and advice
would be invaluable to me.

2498
02:53:54,755 --> 02:53:58,816
What are you asking me?
To be a member of your gang?

2499
02:53:58,892 --> 02:54:01,360
Are you outta
your fuckin' mind?

2500
02:54:01,428 --> 02:54:06,161
Do you remember how we
took out Spider for Cruz?

2501
02:54:06,233 --> 02:54:09,168
Together, Paco.
We're unbeatable.

2502
02:54:13,640 --> 02:54:17,633
Your Onda's not my onda,
and it never will be.

2503
02:54:19,746 --> 02:54:22,772
Paco!

2504
02:54:25,519 --> 02:54:28,647
I'll always be
your brother, vato loco.

2505
02:54:28,722 --> 02:54:30,815
Never.

2506
02:54:40,434 --> 02:54:43,130
<i>- Orale, Chivito.
- Tucha, carnal. They're watching, homes.</i>

2507
02:54:43,203 --> 02:54:45,228
I know they are.
Let 'em watch.

2508
02:54:45,305 --> 02:54:50,072
<i>[Miklo] The show's just beginning
and they don't even know it.</i>

2509
02:54:50,143 --> 02:54:53,112
<i>This will probably be our last
meeting together, carnales.</i>

2510
02:54:55,048 --> 02:54:59,542
They're trying to break Onda up.
But you know what?

2511
02:54:59,619 --> 02:55:02,349
They're only
helping us grow.

2512
02:55:03,857 --> 02:55:05,882
They're using
the interstate compact...

2513
02:55:05,959 --> 02:55:09,258
<i>to exchange each of you who's from
out of state for cons from Califas.</i>

2514
02:55:10,964 --> 02:55:13,797
So, Chivo, they're
sending you back to Arizona.

2515
02:55:13,867 --> 02:55:16,893
<i>- Como dices?
- Hey, man, we can't do nothin' about it.</i>

2516
02:55:16,970 --> 02:55:20,064
You gotta go. But at least
you'll be back to your mom, man.

2517
02:55:20,140 --> 02:55:22,768
She needs anything, let me know.
I'll take care of her.

2518
02:55:22,843 --> 02:55:26,301
<i>Orale, homes.
Simon que si.</i>

2519
02:55:26,379 --> 02:55:30,748
Geronimo goes back
to Texas.

2520
02:55:30,817 --> 02:55:34,685
<i>- You straighten your son out, que no?
- Simon.</i>

2521
02:55:37,524 --> 02:55:39,549
They're trying
to break up La Onda!

2522
02:55:39,626 --> 02:55:41,560
But we're gonna
turn it on 'em!

2523
02:55:43,764 --> 02:55:45,789
And you know how
we're gonna do that?

2524
02:55:47,467 --> 02:55:51,426
Each of you is gonna establish
your own chapters.

2525
02:55:51,505 --> 02:55:56,670
La Onda has $15,000 for each of you
so you can start things out strong.

2526
02:55:56,743 --> 02:56:01,612
We're gonna spread La Onda
gospel Billy Graham style!

2527
02:56:01,681 --> 02:56:03,740
Yeah.
Say it, homey.

2528
02:56:09,689 --> 02:56:11,714
<i>El Mero Mero
had a dream.</i>

2529
02:56:15,061 --> 02:56:17,222
We are that dream.

2530
02:56:18,465 --> 02:56:21,628
We're gonna multiply
in numbers undreamed of.

2531
02:56:21,701 --> 02:56:24,169
<i>In every pinta,
every barrio.</i>

2532
02:56:24,237 --> 02:56:27,070
Every southwestern state.

2533
02:56:27,140 --> 02:56:29,199
La Onda
has a destiny...

2534
02:56:29,276 --> 02:56:31,744
and no one can stop us.

2535
02:56:36,316 --> 02:56:38,841
<i> Eso!</i>

2536
02:56:41,354 --> 02:56:43,413
<i> Orale!</i>

2537
02:56:43,490 --> 02:56:45,515
<i> Viva La Onda!</i>

2538
02:56:45,592 --> 02:56:48,060
<i>- Tocale, carnal. Orale.
- Viva.</i>

2539
02:56:58,322 --> 02:57:00,722
<i>What about me, carnal?</i>

2540
02:57:00,791 --> 02:57:03,259
Where do I go?

2541
02:57:03,327 --> 02:57:06,455
<i>You stay with me, carnal.</i>

2542
02:57:06,530 --> 02:57:08,930
You're the eyes
behind my back.

2543
02:57:08,999 --> 02:57:11,058
The leg I don't have.

2544
02:57:11,135 --> 02:57:13,535
<i>The other half
of mi corazon.</i>

2545
02:57:26,951 --> 02:57:29,249
You ordered me
to destroy this mold.

2546
02:57:31,622 --> 02:57:36,753
But I kept it for protection...
from you.

2547
02:57:40,231 --> 02:57:42,563
Now I want you
to destroy it.

2548
02:58:01,218 --> 02:58:04,187
- I loved him.
- We both loved him.

2549
02:58:04,255 --> 02:58:07,554
But we did what we
had to do for Onda!

2550
02:58:07,625 --> 02:58:10,594
You were right.

2551
02:58:40,257 --> 02:58:42,623
I give my life to you.

2552
02:58:43,861 --> 02:58:46,557
<i> Jefe!</i>

2553
02:58:55,472 --> 02:58:57,531
<i>Simon.</i>

2554
02:59:11,054 --> 02:59:13,420
<i>- [Paco] What are we doing here?
- No llores, vato.</i>

2555
02:59:13,490 --> 02:59:16,516
<i>No mas ven.</i>

2556
02:59:16,593 --> 02:59:20,029
- Come on, man.
- Man, you got me outta bed to come down here?

2557
02:59:20,097 --> 02:59:22,258
Think you lost more
than your hair, vato.

2558
02:59:22,332 --> 02:59:26,098
Ha! Don't believe all that
shit you hear about Samson, ese.

2559
02:59:26,169 --> 02:59:29,366
I'm just strippin' myself
down to the bone, homes.

2560
02:59:29,439 --> 02:59:32,602
<i>- What if I said I wouldn't come?
- Shit, I knew you would come.</i>

2561
02:59:33,844 --> 02:59:35,835
<i>Shee... Huacha.</i>

2562
02:59:35,912 --> 02:59:38,540
Come look at yourself
in the mirror, ese.

2563
02:59:42,352 --> 02:59:44,286
Oh, man.

2564
02:59:44,354 --> 02:59:46,879
<i>It's not all
marked up, man.</i>

2565
02:59:46,957 --> 02:59:48,948
<i>It's a sign
of respect.</i>

2566
02:59:49,026 --> 02:59:54,054
For ten years, man, I've been
Star Trekking in the Twilight Zone.

2567
02:59:54,131 --> 02:59:57,965
<i>Thought if I came and looked at this,
I might find my way back, que no?</i>

2568
02:59:59,569 --> 03:00:02,367
<i>[Cruz] Damn!
We were all innocent, eh.</i>

2569
03:00:02,439 --> 03:00:06,398
That's all gone, Cruzito.
It ain't like that anymore.

2570
03:00:06,476 --> 03:00:09,934
<i>What, not even a little carnalismo
left in there, ese?</i>

2571
03:00:10,013 --> 03:00:13,346
What, you think you use brotherhood up
like a shot of tequila?

2572
03:00:13,417 --> 03:00:17,581
<i>[Cruz] You just drink it down,
it burns, makes you feel good, ya?</i>

2573
03:00:17,654 --> 03:00:19,986
<i>And you're left with a hangover
the rest of your life?</i>

2574
03:00:20,057 --> 03:00:22,025
Look, man, you showed me
your mural.

2575
03:00:22,092 --> 03:00:24,185
You're a good artist.
I think you're the best.

2576
03:00:24,261 --> 03:00:26,252
Now come on. Let's go.

2577
03:00:26,329 --> 03:00:29,594
Just 'cause you wear sunglasses
don't mean you're blind, ese.

2578
03:00:29,666 --> 03:00:32,260
Oh, shit! You wanna know
what I see up there?

2579
03:00:32,335 --> 03:00:34,735
A fantasy, man.
A dream.

2580
03:00:34,805 --> 03:00:37,467
Three vatos looking for
something that wasn't there.

2581
03:00:37,541 --> 03:00:41,910
Loco, we stood by each other.
We trusted each other.

2582
03:00:41,978 --> 03:00:43,741
<i> Orale! That's
worth believing in!</i>

2583
03:00:43,814 --> 03:00:45,782
<i>Shit, we were familia,
homes.</i>

2584
03:00:45,849 --> 03:00:50,343
And never again, Cruzito.
Miklo and I are finished, man.

2585
03:00:50,420 --> 03:00:53,719
<i>He ain't my family!
I hate that fuckin' puto!</i>

2586
03:00:53,790 --> 03:00:56,281
You oughta scrape his ass
off the wall like dirt.

2587
03:00:56,359 --> 03:01:00,819
<i>Chale, vato. No matter how much hate there is
between you and him, you're still connected.</i>

2588
03:01:00,897 --> 03:01:03,957
You got the same blood pumping
through both your hearts, ese.

2589
03:01:04,034 --> 03:01:06,229
That's a bond
you can never break.

2590
03:01:06,303 --> 03:01:09,101
Neither can Miklo.

2591
03:01:09,172 --> 03:01:11,072
He's still just trying
to be like you!

2592
03:01:11,141 --> 03:01:13,666
<i>- That's bullshit!
-  Simon, ese! Come on!</i>

2593
03:01:13,744 --> 03:01:16,645
<i> El Gallo Negro!
The baddest Chicano in the barrio!</i>

2594
03:01:16,713 --> 03:01:19,705
Yeah, well, that ain't me!
Not anymore.

2595
03:01:22,385 --> 03:01:24,319
You ain't changed
a bit, ese.

2596
03:01:25,722 --> 03:01:27,690
Oh, so what?
What are you saying?

2597
03:01:27,758 --> 03:01:30,022
It's all my fault the way
everything turned out?

2598
03:01:42,239 --> 03:01:44,230
Oh, I see.

2599
03:01:51,248 --> 03:01:53,341
<i>Orale.</i>

2600
03:01:53,416 --> 03:01:56,317
What, you think you got
so much fucking power, huh?

2601
03:01:59,589 --> 03:02:02,854
<i>You control everybody's
destiny? Chale.</i>

2602
03:02:05,762 --> 03:02:08,822
- No, you're right, man. I set Miklo up.
- No, I'm not.

2603
03:02:08,899 --> 03:02:12,300
I made him go after Spider.
I started the whole fuckin' thing.

2604
03:02:12,369 --> 03:02:14,997
Relax, ese.

2605
03:02:15,071 --> 03:02:17,938
- Your back wouldn't be all fucked up.
- [Sighs]

2606
03:02:18,008 --> 03:02:21,705
- Miklo wouldn't be in prison. He'd still have his leg.
- Hey, I forgive you, ese.

2607
03:02:21,778 --> 03:02:24,144
I don't want
your forgiveness, man!

2608
03:02:26,183 --> 03:02:30,483
You know, that's your fuckin' problem,
ese. You can't forgive yourself.

2609
03:02:33,356 --> 03:02:36,120
You need that guilt.
It's what keeps you going.

2610
03:02:36,193 --> 03:02:40,459
Hey, I know, bro. I fed mine
through a needle for ten years.

2611
03:02:43,900 --> 03:02:47,301
<i>And that guero up there, hating
his own fuckin' white skin?</i>

2612
03:02:47,370 --> 03:02:50,032
Shit, he's got it worse
than both of us.

2613
03:02:52,742 --> 03:02:57,304
<i>You gotta cut it loose, carnal.
It's fucking poison!</i>

2614
03:02:58,915 --> 03:03:01,042
That's who we are.

2615
03:03:01,117 --> 03:03:04,985
<i>Three vatos locos
full of carnalismo,</i>

2616
03:03:05,055 --> 03:03:07,922
trying to survive
in a fuckin' war zone.

2617
03:03:07,991 --> 03:03:13,657
<i>But what I know now, bro, is that I need
my familia to do it. We all do.</i>

2618
03:03:16,132 --> 03:03:19,863
<i>Even you,  pinche jura!
Badass cop.</i>

2619
03:03:19,936 --> 03:03:22,461
Hey, don't back away,
vato.

2620
03:03:22,539 --> 03:03:25,940
<i>Life's a risk, carnal.
Remember? You said it yourself.</i>

2621
03:03:26,009 --> 03:03:29,376
<i> Pues orale!
Step into the ring and throw down, ese.</i>

2622
03:03:29,446 --> 03:03:33,041
You a badass?
Take care of business, homes.

2623
03:03:33,116 --> 03:03:35,414
<i> Caiga, puto!</i>

2624
03:03:35,485 --> 03:03:38,386
'Cause we're
from East Los, ese!

2625
03:03:39,556 --> 03:03:42,992
We come out chased
by hounds! Huh?

2626
03:03:45,228 --> 03:03:49,995
<i>Round and round we go,
wearing a pinche rabbit's foot for luck.</i>

2627
03:03:50,066 --> 03:03:52,159
<i>Just ahead of the fuckin'
hounds.  Qu'iubo!</i>

2628
03:03:52,235 --> 03:03:54,669
- Ow!
- Yeah!

2629
03:03:54,738 --> 03:03:58,765
<i> Que vida es!
Que loca vida, homes.</i>

2630
03:04:03,680 --> 03:04:06,342
<i>Pero sabes que, ese?</i>

2631
03:04:06,416 --> 03:04:09,510
<i>- [Sniffling]
- Hey.</i>

2632
03:04:09,586 --> 03:04:14,182
We got something better
than a rabbit's foot, homes.

2633
03:04:14,257 --> 03:04:17,055
<i>We've got familia!</i>

2634
03:04:19,462 --> 03:04:21,521
<i>Raza, huey.</i>

2635
03:04:30,740 --> 03:04:34,198
Hmm? You know
what I'm saying, ese?

2636
03:04:34,277 --> 03:04:36,370
<i>Crees mucho,
Gallo Negro.</i>

2637
03:04:36,446 --> 03:04:39,472
You may be bad, but you
can't dance like Smooth Cruz.

2638
03:04:39,549 --> 03:04:41,449
<i> Orale!
Yo y tu, ese.</i>

2639
03:04:41,518 --> 03:04:45,181
Oh, I see now.
I remember you, vato.

2640
03:04:45,255 --> 03:04:47,314
<i>-  Ah!  Ay, ay, ay!
- El Gallo Negro, vato.</i>

2641
03:04:47,390 --> 03:04:50,188
<i>- I'm a lover, not a fighter, man.
- Oh, si.</i>

2642
03:04:50,260 --> 03:04:53,354
<i>Simon. El merengue
at the Tender Trap '72.</i>

2643
03:04:53,430 --> 03:04:57,093
<i>- Rucas got their hearts broke and I kicked your ass. Pow! Pow!
- Shit!</i>

2644
03:04:57,167 --> 03:04:59,067
Shit, man, I was breakin'
hearts and faces, vato.

2645
03:04:59,135 --> 03:05:03,299
<i>[Cruz]  Oh, si! Bullshit!
You still can't dance, ese!</i>

2646
03:05:03,373 --> 03:05:06,501
<i>You still can't dance.
Yque, loco?</i>

2647
03:05:06,576 --> 03:05:09,443
<i>Yeah, but you can learn, ese.
I'll teach you. Simon.</i>

2648
03:05:09,512 --> 03:05:12,504
'Cause it ain't ever over,
