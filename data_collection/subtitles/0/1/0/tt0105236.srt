1
00:00:07,748 --> 00:00:09,958
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

2
00:00:10,038 --> 00:00:13,298
It's all about a girl
who digs a guy with a big dick.

3
00:00:13,378 --> 00:00:15,588
The entire song
is a metaphor for big dicks.

4
00:00:15,588 --> 00:00:17,048
No, it ain't.

5
00:00:17,138 --> 00:00:20,258
It's about a girl
who's very vulnerable.

6
00:00:20,388 --> 00:00:23,598
She's been fucked over a few times
and she meets a guy who's sensitive.

7
00:00:23,728 --> 00:00:26,938
Whoa. Timeout.
Tell that bullshit to the tourists.

8
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:29,228
Toby? Who the fuck is Toby?

9
00:00:29,358 --> 00:00:33,938
"Like A Virgin" is not about some
sensitive girl who meets a nice fella.

10
00:00:34,028 --> 00:00:36,648
That's what "True Blue" is about.
No argument about that.

11
00:00:36,648 --> 00:00:40,488
- Which one is "True Blue"?
- It was a big-ass hit for Madonna.

12
00:00:40,698 --> 00:00:44,038
I don't even follow that top-of-the-pops
shit, and I've heard of "True Blue."

13
00:00:44,158 --> 00:00:46,958
I didn't say I ain't heard of it.
All I asked is, how's it go?

14
00:00:47,078 --> 00:00:49,458
Excuse me for not being
the world's biggest Madonna fan.

15
00:00:49,578 --> 00:00:51,958
Personally, I can do without her.

16
00:00:52,088 --> 00:00:54,048
I used to like her early stuff,
"Borderline"...

17
00:00:54,168 --> 00:00:57,088
but once she got off with that
"Papa, Don't Preach" phase, I tuned out.

18
00:00:57,178 --> 00:01:00,008
Hey, you guys are making me
lose my train of thought here.

19
00:01:00,088 --> 00:01:02,308
I was sayin' something.
What was it?

20
00:01:02,308 --> 00:01:05,638
Oh, Toby's that
little Chinese girl.

21
00:01:05,728 --> 00:01:08,348
- What was her last name?
- What's that?

22
00:01:08,438 --> 00:01:12,938
It's an old address book I found in
a coat I haven't worn in a coon's age.

23
00:01:13,018 --> 00:01:16,068
- What was that name?
- What the fuck was I talkin' about?

24
00:01:16,148 --> 00:01:18,358
You said "True Blue"
was about a guy--

25
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:20,738
a sensitive girl
who meets a nice guy...

26
00:01:20,738 --> 00:01:23,368
but "Like A Virgin"
was a metaphor for big dicks.

27
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:25,658
Let me tell you what
"Like A Virgin" is about.

28
00:01:25,748 --> 00:01:28,658
It's all about this cooze
who's a regular fuck machine.

29
00:01:28,788 --> 00:01:31,168
I'm talkin' morning, day,
night, afternoon...

30
00:01:31,168 --> 00:01:34,088
dick, dick, dick, dick, dick,
dick, dick, dick, dick!

31
00:01:34,088 --> 00:01:36,378
- How many "dicks" is that?
- A lot.

32
00:01:36,378 --> 00:01:39,718
Then one day, she meets
this John Holmes motherfucker.

33
00:01:39,718 --> 00:01:43,388
It's like, "Whoa, baby." He's like
Charles Bronson in "The Great Escape."

34
00:01:43,468 --> 00:01:46,928
He's diggin' tunnels.
Now she's gettin' serious dick action.

35
00:01:47,018 --> 00:01:51,518
She's feelin' somethin' she ain't
felt since forever: pain, pain.

36
00:01:51,598 --> 00:01:53,188
Chew? Toby Chew?

37
00:01:53,268 --> 00:01:55,568
It hurts. It hurts her.

38
00:01:55,568 --> 00:01:58,068
It shouldn't hurt her.
Her pussy should be Bubble-Yum by now.

39
00:01:58,188 --> 00:02:00,778
But when this cat
fucks her, it hurts.

40
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:04,028
It hurts just like it did
the first time.

41
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:06,738
You see, the pain
is reminding a fuck machine...

42
00:02:06,828 --> 00:02:08,908
what it was once like
to be a virgin.

43
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,828
Hence, "Like A Virgin."

44
00:02:12,998 --> 00:02:14,458
Wong.

45
00:02:14,538 --> 00:02:18,718
-Give me that fuckin' thing.
-What in hell do you think you're doin'?

46
00:02:18,838 --> 00:02:21,838
I'm sick of hearin' it, Joe.
I'll give it back to you when we leave.

47
00:02:21,968 --> 00:02:24,468
What do you mean, when we leave?
Give me it back now!

48
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:28,518
For the past 15 minutes now,
you've been droning on about names.

49
00:02:28,638 --> 00:02:31,438
"Toby. Toby?

50
00:02:31,438 --> 00:02:33,728
Toby? Toby Wong.

51
00:02:33,858 --> 00:02:36,018
Toby Wong? Toby Wong.

52
00:02:36,148 --> 00:02:39,068
Toby Chung fuckin' Charlie Chan."

53
00:02:39,148 --> 00:02:41,568
I've got Madonna's big dick
comin' out of my left ear...

54
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:45,618
and Toby the Jap-- I don't know what--
comin' out of my right.

55
00:02:45,618 --> 00:02:48,118
Give me that book.

56
00:02:48,238 --> 00:02:50,198
Are you gonna put it away?

57
00:02:50,198 --> 00:02:53,878
I'm gonna do whatever
the fuck I want with it.

58
00:02:53,878 --> 00:02:56,248
Well, then I'm afraid
I'm gonna have to keep it.

59
00:02:56,378 --> 00:02:59,298
Hey, Joe,
want me to shoot this guy?

60
00:02:59,378 --> 00:03:00,338
Shit.

61
00:03:00,338 --> 00:03:04,508
You shoot me in a dream,
you better wake up and apologize.

62
00:03:08,348 --> 00:03:11,478
You guys been listenin' to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend?

63
00:03:11,598 --> 00:03:13,478
Yeah. That's fuckin' great.

64
00:03:13,478 --> 00:03:16,398
- You believe the songs they're playin'?
- Know what I heard the other day?

65
00:03:16,478 --> 00:03:19,398
"Heartbeat, It's a Lovebeat" by little
Tony DeFranco and the DeFranco family.

66
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:22,028
I haven't heard that song since
I was in the fifth fuckin' grade.

67
00:03:22,108 --> 00:03:25,778
When I was comin' down here, "The Night
the Lights Went Out in Georgia" came on.

68
00:03:25,778 --> 00:03:28,698
I ain't heard that song
since it was big.

69
00:03:28,788 --> 00:03:31,908
But when it was big, I must've heard it
a million-trillion fuckin' times.

70
00:03:32,038 --> 00:03:33,998
But this is the first time
I ever realized...

71
00:03:34,118 --> 00:03:36,828
that the girl singin' the song
is the one who shot Andy.

72
00:03:36,918 --> 00:03:39,548
You didn't know that Vickie Lawrence
was the one who shot Andy?

73
00:03:39,628 --> 00:03:43,508
- I thought the cheatin' wife shot Andy.
- They say that at the end of the song.

74
00:03:43,588 --> 00:03:47,048
I know, motherfucker. I just heard it.
That's what I'm talkin' about.

75
00:03:49,218 --> 00:03:51,518
I must've zoned out
during that part before.

76
00:03:51,518 --> 00:03:51,638
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

77
00:03:51,638 --> 00:03:55,268
All right,
I'll take care of the check.

78
00:03:55,398 --> 00:03:57,768
You guys can get the tip.

79
00:03:57,768 --> 00:04:00,188
Should be about a buck apiece.

80
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:03,528
And you, when I come back
I want my book.

81
00:04:03,528 --> 00:04:06,028
Sorry. It's my book now.

82
00:04:06,028 --> 00:04:10,078
Hey, I changed my mind.
Shoot this piece of shit, will ya?

83
00:04:14,578 --> 00:04:17,168
All right, everybody cough up
some green for the little lady.

84
00:04:23,008 --> 00:04:25,298
Come on, throw in a buck.

85
00:04:25,428 --> 00:04:26,968
I don't tip.

86
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:29,798
- You don't tip?
- I don't believe in it.

87
00:04:29,888 --> 00:04:31,968
You don't believe in tipping?

88
00:04:32,098 --> 00:04:35,308
Do you know what these chicks make?
They make shit.

89
00:04:35,438 --> 00:04:38,148
If she don't make enough money,
she can quit.

90
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,898
I don't even know a fuckin' Jew
who'd have the balls to say that.

91
00:04:41,978 --> 00:04:44,688
Let me get this straight.
You don't ever tip, huh?

92
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:47,528
I don't tip because
society says I have to.

93
00:04:47,528 --> 00:04:51,988
If they really put forth the effort,
I'll give 'em somethin' extra.

94
00:04:51,988 --> 00:04:54,618
But this tipping automatically,
it's for the birds.

95
00:04:56,158 --> 00:04:58,368
As far as I'm concerned,
they're just doin' their job.

96
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,328
- This girl was nice.
- She was okay.

97
00:05:00,458 --> 00:05:02,748
- She wasn't anything special.
- What's special?

98
00:05:02,838 --> 00:05:05,468
Take you in the back
and suck your dick?

99
00:05:08,468 --> 00:05:10,968
I'd go over 12% for that.

100
00:05:11,098 --> 00:05:14,928
I ordered coffee, all right?
She's only filled my cup three times.

101
00:05:15,058 --> 00:05:17,018
I want it filled six times.

102
00:05:17,138 --> 00:05:20,348
Six times? Well, what if
she's too fuckin' busy?

103
00:05:20,348 --> 00:05:23,478
The words "too fuckin' busy"
shouldn't be in a waitress's vocabulary.

104
00:05:23,608 --> 00:05:26,188
Excuse me, Mr. Pink,
but the last fuckin' thing you need's...

105
00:05:26,318 --> 00:05:27,778
another cup of coffee.

106
00:05:27,778 --> 00:05:32,238
These ladies aren't starvin' to death.
They make minimum wage.

107
00:05:32,238 --> 00:05:34,328
I used to work minimum wage,
and when I did...

108
00:05:34,448 --> 00:05:37,368
I wasn't lucky enough to have a job
that society deemed tip-worthy.

109
00:05:37,368 --> 00:05:39,538
You don't care they're
countin' on your tips to live?

110
00:05:42,038 --> 00:05:43,918
You know what this is?

111
00:05:44,048 --> 00:05:46,758
The world's smallest violin,
playin' just for the waitresses.

112
00:05:46,838 --> 00:05:50,298
You don't have any idea
what you're talkin' about.

113
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:53,718
These people bust their ass.
This is a hard job.

114
00:05:53,718 --> 00:05:57,178
So's working at McDonald's,
but you don't feel the need to tip them.

115
00:05:57,178 --> 00:05:59,688
They're servin' you food,
but society says...

116
00:05:59,768 --> 00:06:03,518
"Don't tip these guys over here,
but tip these guys." That's bullshit.

117
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:05,818
Waitressing is
the number-one occupation...

118
00:06:05,938 --> 00:06:08,528
for female non-college graduates
in this country.

119
00:06:08,648 --> 00:06:12,618
It's the one job basically
any woman can get and make a living on.

120
00:06:12,698 --> 00:06:14,698
The reason is
because of their tips.

121
00:06:15,948 --> 00:06:17,408
Fuck all that.

122
00:06:20,208 --> 00:06:22,828
I'm very sorry the government
taxes their tips.

123
00:06:22,918 --> 00:06:25,128
That's fucked up.
That ain't my fault.

124
00:06:25,208 --> 00:06:27,418
It would appear that waitresses
are one of the many groups...

125
00:06:27,418 --> 00:06:29,718
the government fucks in the ass
on a regular basis.

126
00:06:29,798 --> 00:06:33,338
Show me a paper that says the government
shouldn't do that, I'll sign it.

127
00:06:33,338 --> 00:06:35,968
I'll vote for it.
But what I won't do is play ball.

128
00:06:36,178 --> 00:06:40,018
This non-college bullshit, I got two
words for that: Learn to fuckin' type.

129
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:43,478
If you're expectin' me to help out with
the rent, you're in for a big surprise.

130
00:06:43,478 --> 00:06:45,438
He's convinced me.
Give me my dollar back.

131
00:06:45,568 --> 00:06:48,898
Hey. Leave the dollars there.

132
00:06:50,448 --> 00:06:53,488
All right, ramblers,
let's get ramblin'.

133
00:06:53,568 --> 00:06:56,278
Wait a minute.
Who didn't throw in?

134
00:06:56,408 --> 00:06:59,118
- Mr. Pink.
- Mr. Pink?

135
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,828
- Why not?
- He don't tip.

136
00:07:01,908 --> 00:07:03,788
He don't tip?

137
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:05,788
- You don't tip?
- He don't believe in it.

138
00:07:05,878 --> 00:07:09,128
Shut up. What do you mean,
you don't believe in it?

139
00:07:09,208 --> 00:07:13,928
Cough up a buck, you cheap bastard.
I paid for your goddamn breakfast.

140
00:07:14,008 --> 00:07:17,888
Since you bought breakfast, I'll put in.
But normally I would never do this.

141
00:07:19,968 --> 00:07:22,268
Never mind what you
normally would do.

142
00:07:22,348 --> 00:07:26,858
Just cough in your goddamn buck
like everybody else. Thank you.

143
00:07:28,728 --> 00:07:32,988
That was the Partridge Family's
"Doesn't Somebody Want To Be Wanted?"...

144
00:07:33,108 --> 00:07:35,198
followed by Edison Lighthouse's...

145
00:07:35,198 --> 00:07:38,408
"Love Grows Where
My Rosemary Goes"...

146
00:07:38,528 --> 00:07:42,078
as K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s" weekend...

147
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:44,788
just keeps on truckin'.

148
00:07:44,788 --> 00:07:45,208
just keeps on truckin'.

149
00:09:28,518 --> 00:09:30,308
I'm gonna die.

150
00:09:31,558 --> 00:09:33,228
I'm gonna die!

151
00:09:33,318 --> 00:09:36,238
Just hold on, buddy boy!

152
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:38,028
I'm gonna die!

153
00:09:40,408 --> 00:09:43,328
- I'm sorry!
- Give me your hand.

154
00:09:43,328 --> 00:09:47,708
I can't believe she killed me, man!
Who'd have fuckin' thought that?

155
00:09:47,828 --> 00:09:52,288
Hey, just cancel
that shit right now!

156
00:09:52,418 --> 00:09:56,258
You're hurt. You're hurt
real fuckin' bad, but you ain't dying!

157
00:10:02,718 --> 00:10:05,768
All this blood's scarin'
the shit out of me, Larry!

158
00:10:05,768 --> 00:10:08,268
I'm gonna die!
I know it!

159
00:10:08,268 --> 00:10:11,398
Excuse me, I didn't realize
you had a degree in medicine.

160
00:10:13,478 --> 00:10:15,568
Are you a doctor?

161
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,528
Are you a doctor?

162
00:10:17,528 --> 00:10:20,028
Answer me, please!
Are you a doctor?

163
00:10:22,028 --> 00:10:24,738
No, I'm not.
I'm not.

164
00:10:24,828 --> 00:10:27,868
So you admit you don't know
what you're talkin' about.

165
00:10:27,948 --> 00:10:32,538
If you're through givin' me your
amateur opinion, lie back and listen.

166
00:10:32,668 --> 00:10:35,998
I'm takin' you back to the rendezvous,
Joe's gonna get you a doctor...

167
00:10:36,088 --> 00:10:39,838
the doctor's gonna
fix you up and...

168
00:10:39,838 --> 00:10:42,138
you're gonna be okay.

169
00:10:42,258 --> 00:10:45,598
Now say it!
You're gonna be okay!

170
00:10:45,678 --> 00:10:47,138
Say it!

171
00:10:47,268 --> 00:10:50,058
You're gonna be okay!

172
00:10:50,058 --> 00:10:53,188
Say the goddamn words!
You're gonna be okay!

173
00:10:53,308 --> 00:10:54,768
Oh, God!

174
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:56,858
Say the goddamn fuckin' words!

175
00:10:56,938 --> 00:10:58,528
Say it!

176
00:10:58,608 --> 00:11:00,818
Okay, Larry.

177
00:11:00,898 --> 00:11:03,738
Correct! Correct!

178
00:11:06,448 --> 00:11:08,408
I'm okay.

179
00:11:16,338 --> 00:11:18,758
Look where we are.

180
00:11:18,758 --> 00:11:21,468
Look where we are.

181
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:25,428
She had a baby, man.
She had a baby!

182
00:11:25,428 --> 00:11:27,388
We're in a warehouse.

183
00:11:28,428 --> 00:11:31,768
Who's a tough guy?
Who's a tough guy?

184
00:11:32,808 --> 00:11:35,648
Come on, who's a tough guy?

185
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,568
Who's a tough guy?
You're a tough guy.

186
00:11:38,648 --> 00:11:40,528
You're a fuckin' tough guy.

187
00:11:46,068 --> 00:11:48,788
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

188
00:11:48,788 --> 00:11:51,158
We made it. We made it.

189
00:11:51,288 --> 00:11:54,618
We fuckin' made it.
We have fuckin' made it.

190
00:11:56,708 --> 00:11:59,628
We're in a warehouse.
Look where we are.

191
00:12:00,958 --> 00:12:03,048
Look where we are.

192
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:06,798
Hold on. Hold on.

193
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:10,678
- Shit!
- Stop bangin' your head.

194
00:12:10,768 --> 00:12:13,178
You're gonna bang
a fuckin' hole in the floor.

195
00:12:14,518 --> 00:12:17,018
You don't wanna hurt
the fuckin' floor, do you?

196
00:12:18,268 --> 00:12:20,268
I can't do anything for you.

197
00:12:20,358 --> 00:12:22,778
But when Joe gets here...

198
00:12:22,858 --> 00:12:24,858
which should be any time now...

199
00:12:24,948 --> 00:12:28,068
he's gonna help you out,
he's gonna take care of you.

200
00:12:28,068 --> 00:12:30,578
We're gonna sit
and wait for Joe.

201
00:12:32,578 --> 00:12:35,998
- Who are we waitin' for?
- Joe.

202
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:44,548
Larry, I'm fucking scared, man.

203
00:12:47,468 --> 00:12:50,388
Would you please hold me?

204
00:12:50,388 --> 00:12:52,178
Yeah, sure.

205
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:20,838
You go ahead and be scared.

206
00:13:20,838 --> 00:13:23,338
You've been brave enough
for one day.

207
00:13:27,428 --> 00:13:30,638
I just want you
to relax now, okay?

208
00:13:30,758 --> 00:13:33,138
You're not gonna fuckin' die.
You're gonna be fine.

209
00:13:33,258 --> 00:13:36,678
When Joe gets here,
he'll make you 100% again.

210
00:13:38,268 --> 00:13:40,858
Am I hurt?
I'm hurt bad, Larry.

211
00:13:41,808 --> 00:13:44,938
It's not good, no.

212
00:13:45,028 --> 00:13:46,488
Hey, Larry...

213
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:50,568
bless your heart
for what you're tryin' to do.

214
00:13:51,818 --> 00:13:54,538
I was panicking
for a minute back there.

215
00:13:55,578 --> 00:13:58,708
But I got my senses back now.

216
00:13:58,788 --> 00:14:01,918
The situation is,
I'm shot in the belly.

217
00:14:01,918 --> 00:14:05,048
Without medical attention,
I'm gonna die.

218
00:14:08,718 --> 00:14:12,258
- I can't take you to a hospital.
- Fuck jail, man!

219
00:14:12,258 --> 00:14:16,848
You don't have to take me in.
Just drive me up to the front, man.

220
00:14:16,928 --> 00:14:20,598
Just drop me on the sidewalk.
I'll take care of myself.

221
00:14:23,108 --> 00:14:27,358
I won't tell 'em anything, man.
I won't tell 'em anything.

222
00:14:27,488 --> 00:14:30,198
I swear to fucking God, man.

223
00:14:31,858 --> 00:14:35,408
Just look in my eyes, Larry.
Look in my eyes.

224
00:14:36,658 --> 00:14:41,248
I won't tell them anything.

225
00:14:41,248 --> 00:14:43,208
You'll be safe, man.

226
00:14:44,668 --> 00:14:48,628
You're not gonna fuckin' die, kid.
All right?

227
00:14:48,758 --> 00:14:51,878
Listen to me.
You're gonna be fine.

228
00:14:53,338 --> 00:14:55,298
Along with the kneecap...

229
00:14:55,428 --> 00:14:57,928
the gut is the most painful area
a guy can get shot in.

230
00:14:58,018 --> 00:14:59,178
No shit!

231
00:14:59,268 --> 00:15:02,098
But it takes a long time
to die from it.

232
00:15:02,098 --> 00:15:04,478
I'm talkin' days.

233
00:15:04,608 --> 00:15:08,778
You're gonna wish you were dead, but
it takes days to die from your wound.

234
00:15:08,858 --> 00:15:10,648
Time is on your side.

235
00:15:10,648 --> 00:15:12,948
Was that a fucking setup, or what?

236
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:16,488
Shit. Orange got tagged?

237
00:15:17,538 --> 00:15:19,408
Gut shot.

238
00:15:19,408 --> 00:15:21,708
Fuck. Where's Brown?

239
00:15:21,788 --> 00:15:23,168
Dead.

240
00:15:24,708 --> 00:15:26,708
How did he die?

241
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:29,918
How the fuck do you think?
The cops shot him.

242
00:15:30,878 --> 00:15:32,128
This is bad.

243
00:15:32,218 --> 00:15:35,888
This is so fucking bad.
Is it bad?

244
00:15:35,968 --> 00:15:37,638
As opposed to good?

245
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,978
Man, this is fucked up.

246
00:15:41,098 --> 00:15:43,268
This is so fucked up.

247
00:15:43,388 --> 00:15:46,398
Somebody fucked us up
big time, man.

248
00:15:49,028 --> 00:15:52,988
- You really think we were set up?
- Do you even doubt it, man?

249
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:57,578
I don't think we got set up, I know it.
Where did all those cops come from, huh?

250
00:15:57,578 --> 00:16:00,078
One minute they're not there,
and the next minute they're there.

251
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:03,408
I didn't hear any sirens.
The alarm went off, okay?

252
00:16:03,498 --> 00:16:05,918
When an alarm goes, you got
a four-minute response time.

253
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:08,708
Unless a patrol car is cruising
that street at that moment...

254
00:16:08,708 --> 00:16:11,338
you got four minutes before
they can realistically respond.

255
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:14,338
In one minute, there were
17 blue boys out there...

256
00:16:14,468 --> 00:16:17,798
all knowing exactly what the fuck they
were doing, and they were all there!

257
00:16:18,848 --> 00:16:21,768
Remember that second wave
that showed up in the cars?

258
00:16:21,848 --> 00:16:24,478
Those were the ones responding to the
alarm, but those first motherfuckers...

259
00:16:24,558 --> 00:16:26,978
they were there
and they were waitin' for us.

260
00:16:27,058 --> 00:16:29,568
Haven't you fuckin'
thought about this?

261
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:32,398
I haven't had a chance to think.

262
00:16:32,398 --> 00:16:35,738
First I was just tryin'
to get the fuck outta there.

263
00:16:35,818 --> 00:16:38,868
And after we got away,
I've just been dealin' with him.

264
00:16:38,948 --> 00:16:41,238
Better start thinkin' about it,
'cause that's all I'm thinkin' about.

265
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:44,158
I wasn't even gonna come here.
I was just gonna drive off, man...

266
00:16:44,288 --> 00:16:46,868
because whoever set us up
knows about this place.

267
00:16:46,998 --> 00:16:50,748
There could've been cops here waitin'!
There could be cops comin' right now!

268
00:16:54,378 --> 00:16:57,718
Let's go in the other room.
Hey. In there.

269
00:16:57,718 --> 00:17:00,348
Larry, don't leave me.

270
00:17:04,728 --> 00:17:08,348
I'll be right in the other room, okay?
I'll be right there lookin' at ya.

271
00:17:08,478 --> 00:17:11,068
I'm right here
lookin' at you, okay?

272
00:17:13,568 --> 00:17:15,568
I'm right over there.

273
00:17:17,858 --> 00:17:19,738
Larry...

274
00:17:19,818 --> 00:17:22,038
I'm gonna fucking die.

275
00:17:22,118 --> 00:17:23,908
Larry.

276
00:17:25,868 --> 00:17:28,368
What the fuck
am I doin' here, man?

277
00:17:28,498 --> 00:17:30,588
I felt funny about
this job right off.

278
00:17:30,668 --> 00:17:34,338
As soon as I felt it I should have said,
"No, thank you," but I never listen.

279
00:17:34,418 --> 00:17:36,718
Every time I ever got fucked
buying weed, the same thing.

280
00:17:36,838 --> 00:17:39,428
I didn't trust the guy,
but I wanted to believe him.

281
00:17:39,548 --> 00:17:42,468
If he's not lying and it really
is Thai stick, then it's great.

282
00:17:42,468 --> 00:17:45,888
But it never is, and I always said that
if I felt that about a job, I'd walk.

283
00:17:46,018 --> 00:17:49,148
And I didn't. I didn't
because of the fuckin' money!

284
00:17:49,228 --> 00:17:51,938
What's done is done.
I need you cool.

285
00:17:53,108 --> 00:17:54,978
Are you cool?

286
00:17:56,108 --> 00:17:57,778
I'm cool.

287
00:17:59,238 --> 00:18:01,738
Splash some water on your face.

288
00:18:05,498 --> 00:18:07,368
Take a breather.

289
00:18:21,758 --> 00:18:24,888
Relax. Have a cigarette.

290
00:18:25,008 --> 00:18:26,968
I quit.

291
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:29,808
- All right.
- Why, you got one?

292
00:19:02,638 --> 00:19:06,178
Okay, let's go through
what happened.

293
00:19:06,308 --> 00:19:08,808
We're in the place,
everything's going fine.

294
00:19:08,888 --> 00:19:11,098
Then the alarm gets tripped.

295
00:19:12,558 --> 00:19:15,478
I turn around
and all these cops are outside.

296
00:19:17,438 --> 00:19:20,988
You're right. It was like, bam,
I blinked my eyes and they're there.

297
00:19:21,108 --> 00:19:25,368
Everybody starts going ape-shit.
Then Mr. Blonde starts to shoot all--

298
00:19:25,488 --> 00:19:28,488
- That's not correct.
- What's wrong with it?

299
00:19:28,618 --> 00:19:32,248
Okay. The cops did not show up
after the alarm went off.

300
00:19:32,368 --> 00:19:35,918
The cops didn't show up until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

301
00:19:35,998 --> 00:19:39,128
- Soon as I heard the alarm, I saw cops.
- It wasn't that soon.

302
00:19:39,258 --> 00:19:43,088
They didn't let their presence be known
until after Mr. Blonde became a madman.

303
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:46,138
I'm not sayin' they weren't there.
I'm sayin' they were there.

304
00:19:46,218 --> 00:19:50,098
But they didn't make a move until after
Mr. Blonde started shootin' everybody.

305
00:19:50,098 --> 00:19:53,098
I mean, that's how
I know we were set up.

306
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:56,438
- Mr. White, you can see that--
- Enough of this "Mr. White" shit.

307
00:19:56,558 --> 00:20:00,318
Wait! Don't tell me you're fuckin' name!
I don't wanna know it!

308
00:20:00,318 --> 00:20:02,898
Jesus Christ,
I ain't gonna tell you mine.

309
00:20:08,238 --> 00:20:10,538
You're right.
This is bad.

310
00:20:15,828 --> 00:20:19,378
- How did you get out?
- I shot my way out.

311
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:21,878
Everybody started shootin',
so I blasted my way out of there.

312
00:20:26,178 --> 00:20:30,008
Move it! Get outta the way!
Get the fuck outta the way!

313
00:20:31,888 --> 00:20:33,558
Get the fuck outta the way!

314
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:37,018
Move it!
Get outta the way!

315
00:20:42,648 --> 00:20:45,778
Jesus Christ!
What the fuck is your problem, man?

316
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:49,118
- You fuckin' asshole!
- Fuck you!

317
00:20:49,118 --> 00:20:50,028
Move!

318
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,708
Jesus!

319
00:20:58,788 --> 00:21:01,208
Get outta the car!
Get the fuck outta the car!

320
00:21:01,298 --> 00:21:03,508
Move it!
Move outta the way!

321
00:21:32,578 --> 00:21:35,078
I tagged a couple of cops.

322
00:21:35,198 --> 00:21:37,288
Did you kill anybody?

323
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:40,498
- A few cops.
- No real people?

324
00:21:40,628 --> 00:21:42,498
Just cops.

325
00:21:53,848 --> 00:21:55,848
Could you believe Mr. Blonde?

326
00:21:57,388 --> 00:22:00,308
That was the most insane
fuckin' thing I have ever seen.

327
00:22:00,438 --> 00:22:03,148
Why the fuck would Joe
hire a guy like that?

328
00:22:03,228 --> 00:22:04,818
I don't want to kill anybody.

329
00:22:04,898 --> 00:22:07,528
If I gotta get out that door
and you're standin' in my way...

330
00:22:07,528 --> 00:22:10,028
one way or the other
you're gettin' outta my way.

331
00:22:10,028 --> 00:22:12,408
That's the way I look at it.

332
00:22:12,528 --> 00:22:15,118
The choice between
doin' ten years...

333
00:22:15,118 --> 00:22:17,958
and takin' out
some stupid motherfucker...

334
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:21,078
ain't no choice at all.

335
00:22:21,168 --> 00:22:23,878
But I ain't no madman, either.

336
00:22:23,878 --> 00:22:27,548
What the fuck was Joe thinkin'?
You can't work with a guy like that.

337
00:22:30,048 --> 00:22:33,468
We're awful goddamn lucky he didn't
tag us when he shot the place up.

338
00:22:33,598 --> 00:22:37,558
I came this close
to takin' his ass out myself.

339
00:22:37,638 --> 00:22:40,688
I mean, everybody panics.
Everybody.

340
00:22:40,688 --> 00:22:43,398
Things get tense.
It's human nature.

341
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:47,238
You panic. I don't care what
your name is, you can't help it.

342
00:22:47,238 --> 00:22:51,108
Fuck, man, you panic on the inside,
in your head, you know?

343
00:22:51,198 --> 00:22:55,368
You give yourself a couple of seconds,
get ahold of it and deal with it.

344
00:22:55,488 --> 00:22:58,618
What you don't do is start shootin' up
the place and start killin' people.

345
00:22:58,618 --> 00:23:02,788
What you're supposed to do
is act like a fuckin' professional.

346
00:23:02,878 --> 00:23:07,458
A psychopath ain't a professional.
You can't work with a psychopath.

347
00:23:07,458 --> 00:23:10,088
You don't know what those
sick assholes are gonna do next.

348
00:23:12,048 --> 00:23:16,428
I mean, Jesus Christ, how old do you
think that black girl was? Twenty?

349
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,728
- Maybe 21?
- If that.

350
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:23,438
Did you see what happened
to anybody else?

351
00:23:24,688 --> 00:23:28,108
Me and Orange jumped in the car,
Brown floored it.

352
00:23:28,228 --> 00:23:30,398
After that,
I don't know what went down.

353
00:23:30,528 --> 00:23:32,408
It was every man for himself.

354
00:23:32,488 --> 00:23:35,408
As far as Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue are
concerned, I ain't got the foggiest...

355
00:23:35,528 --> 00:23:37,698
'cause once I got out,
I never looked back.

356
00:23:37,828 --> 00:23:39,788
What do you think?

357
00:23:39,908 --> 00:23:43,118
What do I think? The cops either
caught 'em or killed 'em.

358
00:23:44,998 --> 00:23:47,628
No chance they punched through?
You found a hole.

359
00:23:47,708 --> 00:23:50,008
Yeah, and that was
a fuckin' miracle.

360
00:23:50,128 --> 00:23:53,888
But even if they did get away,
then where the fuck are they?

361
00:23:53,968 --> 00:23:57,308
You don't think it's possible one of 'em
got ahold of the diamonds and--

362
00:23:57,428 --> 00:24:00,768
- No, no way.
- How can you be so sure?

363
00:24:02,228 --> 00:24:04,728
I got the diamonds.

364
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,738
That's my boy.

365
00:24:14,738 --> 00:24:17,448
- Where?
- I stashed 'em.

366
00:24:17,528 --> 00:24:21,698
If you wanna come with me,
let's go get 'em right now, this second.

367
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:25,458
'Cause I think stayin' here, man, we
should have our fuckin' heads examined.

368
00:24:25,458 --> 00:24:27,538
That was the plan.
We meet here.

369
00:24:27,668 --> 00:24:29,628
Then where the fuck is everybody?

370
00:24:29,628 --> 00:24:32,758
I say the plan becomes null and void
once we found out we got a rat here.

371
00:24:32,878 --> 00:24:35,888
We ain't got the slightest idea
what happened to Mr. Blonde or Mr. Blue.

372
00:24:36,008 --> 00:24:38,388
They could both be dead
or maybe they're arrested.

373
00:24:38,388 --> 00:24:41,308
The cops could have 'em right now
at the station, sweatin' 'em down.

374
00:24:41,428 --> 00:24:45,058
They don't know our names, but they
could be singin' about this place.

375
00:24:52,988 --> 00:24:56,738
I swear to God,
I think I'm fuckin' jinxed.

376
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,738
What?

377
00:25:00,488 --> 00:25:03,618
Two jobs back,
it was a four-man job.

378
00:25:03,618 --> 00:25:06,038
We discovered one of the team
was an undercover cop.

379
00:25:07,998 --> 00:25:09,668
No shit?

380
00:25:10,838 --> 00:25:13,338
Thank God we discovered in time.

381
00:25:13,418 --> 00:25:16,548
We had to forget the whole thing,
just walk the fuck away from it.

382
00:25:17,588 --> 00:25:19,798
So who's the rat this time?

383
00:25:19,798 --> 00:25:21,758
Mr. Blue?

384
00:25:21,888 --> 00:25:23,638
Mr. Brown?

385
00:25:23,768 --> 00:25:27,808
Joe? Joe set this whole thing up.
Maybe he set it up to set it up.

386
00:25:27,938 --> 00:25:31,478
I don't buy it.
Me and Joe go back a long time.

387
00:25:31,478 --> 00:25:34,818
I can tell you definitely, Joe didn't
know a thing about this bullshit.

388
00:25:34,898 --> 00:25:39,488
I know Joe, and me sayin' he definitely
had nothin' to do with it is ridiculous.

389
00:25:39,618 --> 00:25:42,738
I can say I definitely didn't do it,
'cause I know what I did or didn't do.

390
00:25:42,828 --> 00:25:46,288
But I cannot definitely say that about
anybody, 'cause I don't definitely know.

391
00:25:46,288 --> 00:25:48,458
For all I know, you're the rat.

392
00:25:48,458 --> 00:25:50,878
For all I know,
you're the fuckin' rat!

393
00:25:50,878 --> 00:25:53,248
All right, now you're usin'
your fuckin' head.

394
00:25:53,378 --> 00:25:55,878
For all we know, he's the rat.

395
00:25:55,878 --> 00:25:59,218
That kid in there is dying
from a fuckin' bullet I saw him take...

396
00:25:59,298 --> 00:26:01,388
so don't you be calling him a rat!

397
00:26:01,388 --> 00:26:03,808
Look, I'm right, okay?

398
00:26:03,888 --> 00:26:06,308
Somebody's a fuckin' rat.

399
00:26:11,108 --> 00:26:13,688
Where's the commode in this dungeon?
I gotta take a squirt.

400
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:19,448
Go down the hall, make a left,
go up the stairs...

401
00:26:19,528 --> 00:26:21,408
and make a right.

402
00:26:29,118 --> 00:26:32,878
- By the way, how's Alabama?
- Alabama?

403
00:26:32,998 --> 00:26:36,548
I haven't seen Bama
in over a year and a half.

404
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:39,128
But I thought you two
were a team.

405
00:26:40,178 --> 00:26:42,178
We were for a little while.

406
00:26:42,178 --> 00:26:45,808
Did about four jobs together,
then decided to call it quits.

407
00:26:45,928 --> 00:26:47,478
Why?

408
00:26:50,598 --> 00:26:54,358
You push that woman-man thing too long
and it gets to you after a while.

409
00:26:54,478 --> 00:26:56,568
What's she doin' now?

410
00:26:56,648 --> 00:27:00,198
She hooked up with Frank McGar.
They've done a couple jobs together.

411
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:02,408
Hell of a woman.
Good little thief.

412
00:27:06,158 --> 00:27:09,788
- So explain the telegram.
- Five-man job.

413
00:27:09,908 --> 00:27:12,078
Bustin' in and bustin' out
of a diamond wholesaler's.

414
00:27:12,208 --> 00:27:15,128
Can you move the ice afterwards?
I don't know nobody that can move ice.

415
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:17,508
No problem.
We got guys waitin' for it.

416
00:27:17,508 --> 00:27:20,838
What happened to Marcellus Spivey?
Didn't he always move your ice?

417
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:23,338
He's doin' 20 years in Susanville.

418
00:27:23,468 --> 00:27:26,678
Twenty years? Holy God.
What for?

419
00:27:26,808 --> 00:27:28,268
Bad luck.

420
00:27:28,268 --> 00:27:30,138
I guess you can say that again.

421
00:27:31,058 --> 00:27:32,938
What's the exposure like?

422
00:27:33,058 --> 00:27:35,978
Two minutes, tops.
But it's a tough two minutes.

423
00:27:35,978 --> 00:27:39,398
Daylight, during business hours,
dealing with a crowd.

424
00:27:39,528 --> 00:27:42,028
But you'll have the guys
to deal with the crowd.

425
00:27:42,028 --> 00:27:44,948
- How many employees?
- I'd say around 20.

426
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:46,828
Security pretty lax.

427
00:27:46,828 --> 00:27:49,198
They most usually
just deal in boxes.

428
00:27:49,328 --> 00:27:52,328
You know, uncut stones
from the diamond syndicate.

429
00:27:52,458 --> 00:27:57,048
But on this day, they're getting a
shipment of polished stones from lsrael.

430
00:27:57,128 --> 00:27:59,418
They're like a way station,
you know?

431
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:02,878
-They get picked up and sent to Vermont.
-No, they're not.

432
00:28:06,298 --> 00:28:08,308
What's the cut, poppa?

433
00:28:08,388 --> 00:28:12,058
Juicy, junior.
Real juicy.

434
00:28:14,648 --> 00:28:17,268
Look, man, you do what you want.

435
00:28:17,358 --> 00:28:20,188
I'm outta here, man. I'm gonna
check into a motel for a few days.

436
00:28:20,188 --> 00:28:23,198
You know, I'll lay low
and I'll call Joe--

437
00:28:23,318 --> 00:28:25,908
Shit. Did he fuckin' die on us?

438
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:30,198
Huh? ls he dead or what?

439
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:34,578
- He ain't dead.
- What is it?

440
00:28:34,668 --> 00:28:37,378
I think he's just passed out.

441
00:28:37,378 --> 00:28:41,548
He scared the fuckin' shit outta me.
I thought he was dead for sure.

442
00:28:41,548 --> 00:28:44,378
Without medical attention,
he will die for sure.

443
00:28:45,508 --> 00:28:48,428
What are we gonna do, man?
We can't take him to the hospital.

444
00:28:50,098 --> 00:28:53,978
Without medical attention,
he might not live through the night.

445
00:28:54,058 --> 00:28:56,898
The bullet in his belly
is my fault.

446
00:28:56,898 --> 00:29:00,728
While that might not mean jack shit
to you, it means a hell of a lot to me.

447
00:29:00,858 --> 00:29:04,608
First things first, okay?
Stayin' here's goofy. We gotta book up.

448
00:29:04,698 --> 00:29:07,318
So what do you suggest we do?
Go to a hotel?

449
00:29:07,408 --> 00:29:11,578
We got a guy who's shot in the belly,
who can't walk, bleeds like a stuck pig.

450
00:29:11,578 --> 00:29:13,998
And when he's awake,
he screams in pain.

451
00:29:15,038 --> 00:29:16,998
You got an idea, spit it out.

452
00:29:17,128 --> 00:29:18,878
Joe could help.

453
00:29:18,998 --> 00:29:23,798
If we could get in touch with Joe,
Joe could get him to a doctor.

454
00:29:23,878 --> 00:29:26,798
Joe could get a doctor
to come to see him.

455
00:29:26,928 --> 00:29:31,098
Assuming we can trust Joe,
how we gonna get in touch with him?

456
00:29:31,098 --> 00:29:35,058
He's supposed to be here, but he ain't,
which makes me nervous about bein' here.

457
00:29:35,138 --> 00:29:38,898
Even if he is on the up and up, I don't
think he's gonna be too happy with us.

458
00:29:39,018 --> 00:29:41,608
He planned a robbery and
he's got a bloodbath on his hands now.

459
00:29:41,608 --> 00:29:45,068
He's got dead cops, dead robbers,
dead civilians.

460
00:29:45,068 --> 00:29:47,778
I tend to doubt he's gonna have
a lot of sympathy for our plight.

461
00:29:47,858 --> 00:29:52,578
If I was him, I'd put as much distance
between me and this mess as possible.

462
00:29:56,328 --> 00:29:59,128
Before you got here,
Mr. Orange...

463
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:02,878
was askin' me to take him
to a doctor, to a hospital.

464
00:30:04,758 --> 00:30:08,008
I don't like the idea of
turnin' him over to the cops...

465
00:30:08,088 --> 00:30:10,798
but if we don't,
he's gonna die.

466
00:30:10,928 --> 00:30:13,718
He begged me to do it.

467
00:30:13,848 --> 00:30:17,688
Well, all right.
Then I guess we take him to a hospital.

468
00:30:17,808 --> 00:30:19,978
If that's what he said,
let's do it.

469
00:30:20,098 --> 00:30:22,818
Since he don't know nothin' about us,
I say it's his decision.

470
00:30:22,818 --> 00:30:24,478
He knows a little about me.

471
00:30:27,608 --> 00:30:30,948
What? Wait, wait.
You didn't tell him your name, did you?

472
00:30:30,948 --> 00:30:34,078
I told him my first name
and where I was from.

473
00:30:34,158 --> 00:30:35,538
Why?

474
00:30:37,078 --> 00:30:39,708
I told him where I was from
a few days ago.

475
00:30:39,788 --> 00:30:42,498
It was just
a natural conversation.

476
00:30:42,628 --> 00:30:45,628
What was tellin' him your name
when you weren't supposed to?

477
00:30:45,628 --> 00:30:47,218
He asked.

478
00:30:48,758 --> 00:30:52,298
We had just gotten away from the cops.
He just got shot.

479
00:30:52,428 --> 00:30:55,848
It was my fault he got shot.

480
00:30:55,848 --> 00:30:58,348
He's a fuckin' bloody mess.

481
00:30:58,348 --> 00:31:00,848
He's screamin'.

482
00:31:00,848 --> 00:31:04,108
I swear to God, I thought he was
gonna die right then and there.

483
00:31:04,188 --> 00:31:08,068
I'm tryin' to comfort him,
telling him not to worry...

484
00:31:08,148 --> 00:31:11,818
everything's going to be okay,
I'm gonna take care of him.

485
00:31:11,818 --> 00:31:14,198
And he asked me
what my name was.

486
00:31:15,868 --> 00:31:20,578
I mean, the man was dyin' in my arms.
What the fuck was I supposed to do?

487
00:31:22,038 --> 00:31:26,838
Tell him I'm sorry? I can't
give out that fuckin' information?

488
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:29,838
It's against the rules?

489
00:31:29,968 --> 00:31:32,888
I don't trust you enough?

490
00:31:32,968 --> 00:31:36,218
Maybe I should've,
but I couldn't.

491
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,728
Fuck you! Fuck Joe!

492
00:31:38,808 --> 00:31:42,058
- I'm sure it was a beautiful scene.
- Don't fuckin' patronize me!

493
00:31:42,148 --> 00:31:44,558
I have one question. Do they have
a sheet on you where you're from?

494
00:31:44,558 --> 00:31:46,938
- Yeah!
- That's that, then.

495
00:31:47,068 --> 00:31:49,858
I mean, I was worried about
mug shot possibility as it was.

496
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:54,238
He knows A, your name, B, your face,
C, your hometown and D, your specialty.

497
00:31:54,368 --> 00:31:57,578
They're not gonna have to show him a lot
of pictures for him to pick you out!

498
00:31:57,698 --> 00:32:01,248
You didn't tell him anything else
so they could narrow down the selection?

499
00:32:01,328 --> 00:32:04,878
If I have to tell you again to back off,
we're gonna go 'round and 'round.

500
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:07,918
We ain't takin' him to a hospital.

501
00:32:07,998 --> 00:32:09,668
If we don't, he's gonna die.

502
00:32:09,798 --> 00:32:12,798
And I'm very sad about that, but
some fellas are lucky and some ain't.

503
00:32:12,928 --> 00:32:15,508
What the fuck are you
touchin' me for, man?

504
00:32:20,928 --> 00:32:23,018
I'll show you
who you're fuckin' with!

505
00:32:23,138 --> 00:32:25,228
You wanna shoot me,
you piece of shit?

506
00:32:25,308 --> 00:32:28,438
I didn't create this situation,
I'm dealin' with it!

507
00:32:28,438 --> 00:32:32,198
You're actin' like a first-year thief!
I'm actin' like a professional!

508
00:32:32,318 --> 00:32:35,108
If they get him, they could get you,
they could get closer to me...

509
00:32:35,238 --> 00:32:37,198
and that can't happen!

510
00:32:37,198 --> 00:32:39,908
You're lookin' at me like it's my fault?
I didn't tell him my name!

511
00:32:40,038 --> 00:32:42,538
I didn't tell him
where I was from!

512
00:32:42,618 --> 00:32:45,248
Shit! Fifteen minutes ago
you almost told me your name!

513
00:32:45,328 --> 00:32:47,538
You're gonna get stuck
in a situation you created!

514
00:32:47,628 --> 00:32:50,958
So if you wanna throw bad looks around,
throw 'em at a mirror!

515
00:32:51,088 --> 00:32:54,008
You kids shouldn't play so rough.

516
00:32:54,088 --> 00:32:56,928
Somebody's gonna start cryin'.

517
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,678
Mr. Blonde.

518
00:33:00,768 --> 00:33:03,058
Shit. You're fuckin' kickin' me.

519
00:33:07,858 --> 00:33:11,608
What happened to you?
Figured you were dead.

520
00:33:15,278 --> 00:33:17,988
Hey, you okay?

521
00:33:19,238 --> 00:33:21,618
Did you see what happened to Blue?

522
00:33:21,618 --> 00:33:25,288
We didn't know what happened to you.
That's what we were wonderin' about.

523
00:33:27,378 --> 00:33:30,088
Look, Brown is dead,
Orange got it in the belly.

524
00:33:30,168 --> 00:33:32,458
Enough! Enough!

525
00:33:32,458 --> 00:33:35,588
You better start talkin', asshole.

526
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:38,508
'Cause we got shit
we need to talk about.

527
00:33:38,638 --> 00:33:40,388
We're already freaked out.

528
00:33:40,388 --> 00:33:43,848
We need you actin' freaky
like we need a fuckin' bag on our hip.

529
00:33:44,678 --> 00:33:46,638
Okay, let's talk.

530
00:33:46,768 --> 00:33:49,148
We think we got
a rat in the house.

531
00:33:49,268 --> 00:33:51,228
I guarantee we got
a rat in the house.

532
00:33:51,358 --> 00:33:53,108
What makes you say that?

533
00:33:53,228 --> 00:33:55,188
Is that supposed to be funny?

534
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:58,028
Look, we think
this place ain't safe.

535
00:33:58,108 --> 00:34:00,828
This place ain't secure anymore.
We're leavin' and you should go with us.

536
00:34:00,948 --> 00:34:03,118
Nobody's goin' anywhere.

537
00:34:04,078 --> 00:34:06,788
Piss on this fuckin' turd.

538
00:34:06,868 --> 00:34:09,998
- We're outta here.
- Don't take another step, Mr. White.

539
00:34:09,998 --> 00:34:12,838
Fuck you, maniac!

540
00:34:15,628 --> 00:34:17,628
It's your fuckin' fault
we're in this trouble!

541
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:20,218
What's this guy's problem?

542
00:34:20,338 --> 00:34:23,258
What's my problem?
Yeah, I got a fuckin' problem!

543
00:34:23,348 --> 00:34:26,178
I got a big fuckin' problem...

544
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:29,188
with any trigger-happy madman
who almost gets me shot!

545
00:34:31,058 --> 00:34:34,818
- What the fuck you talkin' about?
- That fucking shooting spree!

546
00:34:36,068 --> 00:34:38,278
In the store! Remember?

547
00:34:38,278 --> 00:34:43,078
Oh, fuck 'em. They set off the alarm.
They deserve what they got.

548
00:34:43,158 --> 00:34:45,158
You almost killed me!

549
00:34:46,198 --> 00:34:47,538
Asshole!

550
00:34:49,958 --> 00:34:53,918
If I knew what kind of guy you were, I
never would've agreed to work with you.

551
00:34:55,458 --> 00:34:59,008
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

552
00:34:59,128 --> 00:35:01,088
or are you gonna bite?

553
00:35:01,088 --> 00:35:03,298
What was that?

554
00:35:05,808 --> 00:35:09,768
I'm sorry, I didn't catch it.
Would you repeat it?

555
00:35:09,768 --> 00:35:13,518
Are you gonna bark all day,
little doggie...

556
00:35:14,768 --> 00:35:16,648
or are you gonna bite?

557
00:35:16,728 --> 00:35:19,648
You two assholes, calm the fuck down!
Hey, come on!

558
00:35:19,778 --> 00:35:23,318
What, are we on a playground here?
Am I the only professional?

559
00:35:23,408 --> 00:35:25,828
You're actin' like
a bunch of fuckin' niggers!

560
00:35:25,828 --> 00:35:29,158
Ever work with niggers? Always sayin'
they're gonna kill each other.

561
00:35:29,248 --> 00:35:31,118
You said yourself
you thought about taking him out.

562
00:35:31,248 --> 00:35:33,748
- You fuckin' said that?
- Yeah, I did, okay?

563
00:35:33,838 --> 00:35:37,588
But that was then. Right now, this guy
is the only one I completely trust.

564
00:35:37,588 --> 00:35:40,428
-He's too homicidal to be with the cops.
-You takin' his side?

565
00:35:40,508 --> 00:35:43,548
Fuck sides, man!
What we need here is solidarity!

566
00:35:43,548 --> 00:35:47,518
Somebody's stickin' a red-hot poker
up our ass, and I want to know who.

567
00:35:49,268 --> 00:35:52,398
Fuck. Look, I know
I'm no piece of shit.

568
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:56,358
I'm pretty sure you're okay, and I'm
fuckin' positive you're on the level.

569
00:35:56,478 --> 00:36:00,238
So let's try and figure out
who the bad guy is, all right?

570
00:36:02,608 --> 00:36:04,408
Wow.

571
00:36:04,488 --> 00:36:06,578
That was really exciting.

572
00:36:08,448 --> 00:36:11,498
I bet you're a big
Lee Marvin fan, aren't ya?

573
00:36:13,788 --> 00:36:16,788
Yeah, me too.
I love that guy.

574
00:36:18,458 --> 00:36:23,258
My heart's beatin' so fast,
I'm about to have a heart attack here.

575
00:36:23,258 --> 00:36:28,178
I got somethin' outside that
I'd like to show you guys, so follow me.

576
00:36:28,178 --> 00:36:30,058
Follow you? Where?

577
00:36:31,098 --> 00:36:32,638
To my car.

578
00:36:33,898 --> 00:36:36,308
Did you forget your French fries
to go with the soda?

579
00:36:36,308 --> 00:36:40,148
No, I had them already. I got somethin'
I think you might wanna see, though.

580
00:36:40,148 --> 00:36:42,148
- What?
- It's a big surprise.

581
00:36:42,238 --> 00:36:45,278
I'm sure you'll like it.
Come on.

582
00:36:55,168 --> 00:36:57,458
We still gotta get
outta here, you know.

583
00:36:57,588 --> 00:36:59,958
No. We're gonna stick around
and we're gonna wait.

584
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:03,418
- What for? The cops?
- No. Nice Guy Eddie.

585
00:37:03,508 --> 00:37:08,008
Nice Guy Eddie? What makes you think he
isn't on a plane halfway to Costa Rica?

586
00:37:08,098 --> 00:37:11,428
Because I spoke to him on the phone
and he said he's on the way down here.

587
00:37:11,558 --> 00:37:14,688
You talked to Nice Guy Eddie? Why
didn't you say that in the first place?

588
00:37:14,768 --> 00:37:17,608
- 'Cause you never asked me.
- Hardy-fuckin'-har.

589
00:37:17,688 --> 00:37:20,818
- What'd he say?
- He said stay put.

590
00:37:20,938 --> 00:37:23,438
So in the meantime...

591
00:37:23,528 --> 00:37:26,158
I'll show you guys somethin'.

592
00:37:30,738 --> 00:37:32,288
Jesus Christ.

593
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:35,418
Maybe our boy in blue here
can answer some of these questions...

594
00:37:35,538 --> 00:37:38,878
about this rat business
you've been talkin' about.

595
00:37:38,958 --> 00:37:41,878
You're a piece of work,
my friend.

596
00:37:41,998 --> 00:37:43,968
Let's get him
the fuck outta here.

597
00:37:46,378 --> 00:37:48,678
Hey, Sid, will you relax?

598
00:37:48,758 --> 00:37:51,058
I've known you a long time.
I'm not worried.

599
00:37:51,058 --> 00:37:53,558
I know you'll pay me back.

600
00:37:53,678 --> 00:37:57,438
Don't tell me what I already know.
Don't embarrass me.

601
00:37:57,518 --> 00:38:01,608
So you had a few bad months.
You do what everybody else does.

602
00:38:01,688 --> 00:38:06,608
I don't care if it's J.P. Morgan
or lrving the tailor. You ride it out.

603
00:38:06,608 --> 00:38:09,198
- Vic Vega's outside.
- Hold on.

604
00:38:09,318 --> 00:38:11,278
- Who?
- Vic Vega.

605
00:38:11,488 --> 00:38:14,198
Tell him to come in.
I gotta go.

606
00:38:14,198 --> 00:38:16,708
- Come on in.
- A friend of mine's outside.

607
00:38:16,828 --> 00:38:19,418
I'll be talkin' to you.
Don't worry.

608
00:38:24,008 --> 00:38:26,418
Hey, welcome home, Vic.

609
00:38:27,548 --> 00:38:29,838
How does freedom feel, huh?

610
00:38:29,838 --> 00:38:33,098
- It's a change.
- Ain't that the sad truth.

611
00:38:33,178 --> 00:38:36,098
Sit down, take your coat off,
make yourself at home.

612
00:38:36,228 --> 00:38:38,098
- Have a little drink?
- Yeah.

613
00:38:38,188 --> 00:38:41,228
How about a little Remy Martin?

614
00:38:41,228 --> 00:38:43,188
Sure.

615
00:38:43,318 --> 00:38:45,278
Who's your parole officer?

616
00:38:46,648 --> 00:38:48,738
Seymour Scagnetti.

617
00:38:48,818 --> 00:38:51,318
How is he?

618
00:38:51,448 --> 00:38:53,328
He's a fuckin' asshole.

619
00:38:53,408 --> 00:38:55,408
Won't even let me
leave the halfway house.

620
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:57,998
It never ceases to amaze me.

621
00:38:58,118 --> 00:39:02,288
A fuckin' jungle bunny goes out there,
slits a woman's throat for 25 cents...

622
00:39:02,378 --> 00:39:05,208
he gets Doris Day
for a parole officer.

623
00:39:05,298 --> 00:39:08,968
A good fella like you
winds up with a ball-bustin' prick.

624
00:39:10,928 --> 00:39:14,468
I want you to know I appreciate all
the packages you sent me on the inside.

625
00:39:14,468 --> 00:39:16,468
What the hell
was I supposed to do?

626
00:39:16,468 --> 00:39:18,428
Forget about you?

627
00:39:18,558 --> 00:39:21,478
I just want you to know
that it meant a lot to me.

628
00:39:21,478 --> 00:39:25,108
It was the least I could do. I wish
to hell I could've done a lot more.

629
00:39:25,228 --> 00:39:28,148
Thanks a lot, Joe.

630
00:39:28,238 --> 00:39:29,698
Ah, Vic.

631
00:39:32,948 --> 00:39:34,908
Toothpick Vic.

632
00:39:36,578 --> 00:39:40,538
So tell me your story, kid.
What are your plans?

633
00:39:40,668 --> 00:39:44,088
You son of a bitch. I see you
sittin' there, but I don't believe it.

634
00:39:44,208 --> 00:39:46,588
- How you doin', Toothpick?
- Hey, Eddie.

635
00:39:51,508 --> 00:39:54,638
Listen, I'm sorry.
I should've picked you up myself.

636
00:39:54,718 --> 00:39:57,348
I was-- My fuckin'--
This week's been crazy.

637
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:59,638
I've had my head up my ass
the whole time.

638
00:39:59,728 --> 00:40:02,848
Funny you say that, 'cause that's what
me and your daddy were talkin' about.

639
00:40:02,978 --> 00:40:04,858
That I should've picked you up?

640
00:40:04,938 --> 00:40:07,568
No, that you had
your head up your ass.

641
00:40:09,858 --> 00:40:11,948
I walk in the door, he's like,
"Vic, Vic...

642
00:40:12,028 --> 00:40:15,698
I'm so glad somebody's finally here
who knows what's goin' on.

643
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:18,408
My son Eddie's a fuck-up.

644
00:40:18,488 --> 00:40:21,538
He's ruining the business.

645
00:40:21,538 --> 00:40:25,498
I mean, I love the guy, but he's
flushin' everything down the toilet."

646
00:40:25,498 --> 00:40:28,708
That's what you said, right, Joe?
Tell him yourself.

647
00:40:28,708 --> 00:40:31,548
Eddie, I hate for you
to hear it like this...

648
00:40:31,628 --> 00:40:35,388
but Vic came in
and asked me how business was.

649
00:40:35,508 --> 00:40:38,428
You don't lie to a guy who's
just done four years in the slammer.

650
00:40:38,508 --> 00:40:39,678
That's very true.

651
00:40:45,098 --> 00:40:47,478
All right, enough of this shit!
Break it up!

652
00:40:47,608 --> 00:40:49,898
Come on, this ain't a playground!

653
00:40:53,858 --> 00:40:58,948
You guys wanna roll around on the floor,
you do it in Eddie's office, not mine.

654
00:40:58,948 --> 00:41:01,868
- Daddy, did you see that?
- What?

655
00:41:01,868 --> 00:41:03,958
The guy got me on the ground,
he tried to fuck me.

656
00:41:04,078 --> 00:41:06,668
- You wish.
- You sick bastard, Vic.

657
00:41:06,788 --> 00:41:09,298
You tried to fuck me
in my father's office.

658
00:41:09,298 --> 00:41:12,508
Look, Vic, whatever you wanna do
in the privacy of your own home...

659
00:41:12,628 --> 00:41:14,928
go to it,
but don't try to fuck me.

660
00:41:14,928 --> 00:41:17,098
I don't think of you that way.

661
00:41:17,218 --> 00:41:21,268
I like you a lot, buddy,
but I don't think of you that way.

662
00:41:23,268 --> 00:41:27,858
Listen, if I was a butt cowboy,
I wouldn't even throw you to the posse.

663
00:41:27,938 --> 00:41:31,398
No, you wouldn't.
You'd keep me for yourself.

664
00:41:31,398 --> 00:41:35,778
Four years fuckin' punks up the ass,
you'd appreciate a piece of prime rib.

665
00:41:35,858 --> 00:41:39,198
I might break you in, Nice Guy,
but I'd make you my dog's bitch.

666
00:41:39,328 --> 00:41:40,868
Ain't that a sad sight, Daddy?

667
00:41:40,988 --> 00:41:44,208
A man walks into prison a white man,
walks out talkin' like a fuckin' nigger.

668
00:41:44,328 --> 00:41:47,328
You know what?
I think it's all that black semen...

669
00:41:47,328 --> 00:41:49,838
pumped up your asshole, now it's
backed into your fuckin' brain...

670
00:41:49,958 --> 00:41:52,758
and it's comin' out your mouth!

671
00:41:52,878 --> 00:41:56,718
Eddie, you keep talkin' like a bitch,
I'm gonna slap you like a bitch.

672
00:41:56,838 --> 00:41:59,638
Enough of that shit!
I'm sick of it!

673
00:41:59,758 --> 00:42:01,928
Now both of you, sit down.

674
00:42:07,148 --> 00:42:09,228
Now, Eddie...

675
00:42:09,358 --> 00:42:12,278
when you came in here,
we were talkin' some serious business.

676
00:42:13,528 --> 00:42:15,398
Vic here's got a parole problem.

677
00:42:15,488 --> 00:42:18,408
- Who's your P.O.?
- Seymour Scagnetti.

678
00:42:18,528 --> 00:42:21,118
Scagnetti. Fuck.

679
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:25,198
- I hear he's a motherfucker.
- Oh, he's a fucker.

680
00:42:25,408 --> 00:42:28,538
Won't even let me leave the halfway
house unless I get some shitty job.

681
00:42:28,618 --> 00:42:30,918
You're comin' back
to work for us, right?

682
00:42:34,458 --> 00:42:36,468
Well, I wanna.

683
00:42:36,548 --> 00:42:39,388
But first I gotta prove to,
uh, ass-head...

684
00:42:39,468 --> 00:42:42,808
that I can get a regular,
you know, job-type job...

685
00:42:42,928 --> 00:42:46,058
before I can move out on my own.

686
00:42:46,138 --> 00:42:49,478
I can't come back to work for you guys
if I gotta worry about, uh...

687
00:42:49,478 --> 00:42:51,978
makin' some silly-ass
10:00 curfew...

688
00:42:51,978 --> 00:42:53,978
every fuckin' night.

689
00:42:54,068 --> 00:42:57,398
We can work this out,
can't we, Eddie?

690
00:42:57,528 --> 00:42:59,408
This ain't all that bad.

691
00:42:59,608 --> 00:43:02,618
We can get you
a lot of legitimate jobs.

692
00:43:02,618 --> 00:43:05,538
I'll get you down in Long Beach
as a dockworker.

693
00:43:05,538 --> 00:43:08,868
I don't wanna lift
no fuckin' crates, Eddie.

694
00:43:08,998 --> 00:43:12,418
You ain't gonna lift shit.
You don't even work there.

695
00:43:12,538 --> 00:43:15,548
But as far as the records
are concerned, you do.

696
00:43:15,668 --> 00:43:19,508
I call Matthews and tell him he's got
a new guy, boom, you're on the rotation.

697
00:43:19,628 --> 00:43:23,468
You get a time card. It's clocked
in and out for you every day.

698
00:43:23,598 --> 00:43:28,178
At the end of the week you get a nice
paycheck. Dockworkers do very well.

699
00:43:28,268 --> 00:43:30,898
You can move into a halfway decent place
without Scagnetti goin'...

700
00:43:30,978 --> 00:43:33,188
"Where the fuck's
the money comin' from?"

701
00:43:33,268 --> 00:43:36,818
And, if he decides
to make a surprise visit...

702
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:41,198
that's the day we sent you to Tustin
to pick up a load of shit.

703
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:44,448
If he comes back again, hey,
"Sorry, Seymour.

704
00:43:44,528 --> 00:43:46,118
You just missed him.

705
00:43:46,198 --> 00:43:49,748
We had to send him to the Taft airstrip
five fuckin' hours away.

706
00:43:49,748 --> 00:43:52,578
We had a load of shit he had to
pick up there and bring back here."

707
00:43:52,668 --> 00:43:56,208
Part of your job is goin' different
places. That's the beauty of it.

708
00:43:56,208 --> 00:43:58,838
We got places all over the place.

709
00:43:58,918 --> 00:44:01,218
See, Vic?
Did I tell you not to worry?

710
00:44:01,338 --> 00:44:05,178
- Vic was worried.
- I'll take you to Long Beach tomorrow.

711
00:44:05,298 --> 00:44:09,268
We'll get you fixed up with Matthews,
I'll tell him what's what.

712
00:44:10,728 --> 00:44:13,648
You know, I really appreciate
what you guys are doin'...

713
00:44:13,648 --> 00:44:16,358
but I'd like to know
when I can come back...

714
00:44:16,438 --> 00:44:18,738
you know, do some real work.

715
00:44:18,858 --> 00:44:21,148
Well, it's hard to say.

716
00:44:21,238 --> 00:44:24,068
It's kind of a strange time now.

717
00:44:24,068 --> 00:44:26,578
Things are kind of--

718
00:44:26,658 --> 00:44:29,698
They're a little fucked up,
is what they are.

719
00:44:29,788 --> 00:44:32,828
We're just gettin' ready for
a big meetin' right now in Vegas.

720
00:44:32,918 --> 00:44:37,498
Look, just let Eddie for now
set you up at Long Beach.

721
00:44:37,628 --> 00:44:40,838
Get you a job,
give you some cash...

722
00:44:40,968 --> 00:44:44,088
and get this Scagnetti fuck
off your back...

723
00:44:44,178 --> 00:44:47,428
and then we'll talk
to you, all right?

724
00:44:47,428 --> 00:44:48,558
Huh?

725
00:44:48,678 --> 00:44:52,228
Dad, I got an idea.

726
00:44:52,308 --> 00:44:55,148
Just hear me out.

727
00:44:55,148 --> 00:44:58,688
I know you don't like usin'
the boys on these jobs...

728
00:44:58,778 --> 00:45:03,278
but Vic here-- I mean, he's only
been nothin' but good luck for us.

729
00:45:03,278 --> 00:45:06,278
The guy's a fuckin' rabbit's foot,
for cryin' out loud.

730
00:45:07,528 --> 00:45:09,738
I'd like to have him in.

731
00:45:09,828 --> 00:45:13,578
You know he can handle himself, and
you damn sure know you can trust him.

732
00:45:15,168 --> 00:45:17,248
All right, Vic...

733
00:45:17,338 --> 00:45:21,418
how would you feel about pullin'
a job with about five other guys?

734
00:45:24,008 --> 00:45:26,088
I'd feel great about it.

735
00:45:30,888 --> 00:45:34,558
K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

736
00:45:34,638 --> 00:45:36,728
If you're the 12th caller...

737
00:45:36,848 --> 00:45:40,268
you'll win two tickets to
the monster truck extravaganza...

738
00:45:40,398 --> 00:45:43,608
being held tonight
at the Carson Fairgrounds...

739
00:45:43,738 --> 00:45:48,738
featuring Big Daddy Don Bodine's truck,
"The Behemoth."

740
00:45:48,738 --> 00:45:53,618
The 12th caller wins on the station
where the '70s survived.

741
00:45:58,838 --> 00:46:02,298
Hey, Dov, we got
a major situation here.

742
00:46:02,378 --> 00:46:05,838
I know you know that. I gotta talk to
Daddy and find out what he wants done.

743
00:46:13,638 --> 00:46:18,148
All I know is what Vic told me.
The place turned into a bullet-fest.

744
00:46:18,228 --> 00:46:20,728
He took a cop hostage
just to get the fuck outta there.

745
00:46:20,728 --> 00:46:22,728
Get up! Get up!

746
00:46:25,858 --> 00:46:28,028
Do I sound like
I'm fuckin' jokin'?

747
00:46:28,158 --> 00:46:30,528
He's fuckin' drivin' around
with a cop in his trunk!

748
00:46:35,248 --> 00:46:37,208
I don't know who did what!

749
00:46:37,328 --> 00:46:40,458
I don't know who's got the loot.
I don't know if anybody's got the loot.

750
00:46:40,458 --> 00:46:44,418
I don't know who's dead, who's alive,
who's caught, who's not.

751
00:47:00,058 --> 00:47:03,068
I will know.
I'm practically there now.

752
00:47:04,228 --> 00:47:07,148
But what do I tell
these guys about Daddy?

753
00:47:09,318 --> 00:47:12,578
All right.
You sure that's what he said?

754
00:47:14,038 --> 00:47:16,198
Okay, that's what I'll tell 'em.

755
00:47:16,328 --> 00:47:18,288
Huh? Fuck you!

756
00:47:18,408 --> 00:47:20,918
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

757
00:47:20,998 --> 00:47:22,588
You like bein' a fuckin' hero?

758
00:47:25,798 --> 00:47:28,628
You're gonna suffer
for nothin', pal.

759
00:47:28,628 --> 00:47:31,008
You hear me?
'Cause you're gonna fuckin' talk.

760
00:47:31,138 --> 00:47:34,058
- I don't fucking know anything!
- You fuckin' know.

761
00:47:34,138 --> 00:47:36,638
You know. Look at me.
You fuckin' know.

762
00:47:36,768 --> 00:47:39,268
What in the Sam Hill's
goin' on here?

763
00:47:39,268 --> 00:47:42,398
- Nice Guy, we got a cop.
- Where the fuck is Joe?

764
00:47:43,648 --> 00:47:45,608
Holy shit. Orange is dead.

765
00:47:45,728 --> 00:47:49,568
No, he's not dead, but he will be
if we don't get him taken care of.

766
00:47:49,698 --> 00:47:52,068
We were set up.
The cops were there waitin' for us.

767
00:47:52,198 --> 00:47:54,488
What? Nobody fuckin'
set anybody up.

768
00:47:54,578 --> 00:47:56,238
The cops were there
waitin' for us.

769
00:47:56,238 --> 00:47:57,908
- Bullshit.
- Fuck you, man!

770
00:47:58,038 --> 00:48:01,368
You weren't there, we were,
and the cops had that store staked out.

771
00:48:01,458 --> 00:48:04,788
Okay, Mr. Fuckin' Detective,
you're so fuckin' smart.

772
00:48:04,788 --> 00:48:08,128
- Who did it?
- We've been askin' each other!

773
00:48:08,258 --> 00:48:11,258
What'd you come up with?
You think I fuckin' set you up?

774
00:48:11,378 --> 00:48:14,098
I don't know, but somebody did.

775
00:48:15,348 --> 00:48:18,888
Nobody did. You fuckin' assholes
turned the jewelry store--

776
00:48:18,978 --> 00:48:22,018
- Don't you call me an asshole!
- You fuckin' idiot!

777
00:48:22,098 --> 00:48:24,108
Turned the jewelry store
into a wild west show...

778
00:48:24,188 --> 00:48:26,608
and you wonder why
the fuckin' cops show up?

779
00:48:28,148 --> 00:48:29,608
Where's Joseph?

780
00:48:29,738 --> 00:48:31,898
I don't know.
I ain't talked to him.

781
00:48:32,028 --> 00:48:36,408
I talked to Dov. He says Daddy's comin'
down here and he's fuckin' pissed.

782
00:48:36,488 --> 00:48:38,908
He's pissed?
I told you he'd be pissed.

783
00:48:38,998 --> 00:48:40,458
What'd Joe say?

784
00:48:40,578 --> 00:48:42,458
I told you,
I ain't talked to him!

785
00:48:42,538 --> 00:48:45,458
- All I know is he's pissed.
- What are you gonna do about him?

786
00:48:45,588 --> 00:48:49,628
Give me a fuckin' chance to breathe.
I got a few questions of my own here.

787
00:48:49,628 --> 00:48:51,218
You ain't dying. He is.

788
00:48:51,218 --> 00:48:54,758
All right, Mr. Fuckin' Compassion,
I will call somebody!

789
00:48:54,838 --> 00:48:56,508
Who?

790
00:48:56,638 --> 00:49:00,058
A fuckin' snake charmer!
Who do you think? I'll call a doctor.

791
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:04,018
They'll fix him right up.
What happened to Brown and Blue?

792
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:06,308
Brown's dead.
We don't know what happened to Blue.

793
00:49:06,438 --> 00:49:08,318
Brown's dead? Are you sure?

794
00:49:08,398 --> 00:49:12,358
I'm sure. I was there.
He took one in the head.

795
00:49:12,488 --> 00:49:14,778
Nobody's got a clue
what happened to Mr. Blue?

796
00:49:14,778 --> 00:49:16,948
Either he's alive or he's dead...

797
00:49:17,078 --> 00:49:20,078
or the cops got him
or they don't.

798
00:49:22,998 --> 00:49:25,628
I take it this is the bastard
you told me about.

799
00:49:25,628 --> 00:49:27,588
Why are you beatin' on him?

800
00:49:27,588 --> 00:49:29,998
Maybe he could tell us
who set us up.

801
00:49:30,088 --> 00:49:34,258
You beat this prick long enough, he'll
tell you he started the Chicago Fire.

802
00:49:34,378 --> 00:49:37,178
Now that don't necessarily
make it fuckin' so!

803
00:49:37,298 --> 00:49:39,468
Come on, man, think!

804
00:49:39,468 --> 00:49:42,928
All right,
first things fuckin' last.

805
00:49:43,018 --> 00:49:47,518
Who's got the stones? Please, somebody
tell me one little fuckin' favor.

806
00:49:47,518 --> 00:49:49,068
I got a bag.

807
00:49:49,188 --> 00:49:53,238
Okay? I stashed it 'til we could be sure
this place wasn't a police station.

808
00:49:53,358 --> 00:49:55,658
Good for you.
Now let's go get it.

809
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:59,908
First we gotta get rid of those cars.
It looks like Sam's Hot Car Lot outside.

810
00:50:00,028 --> 00:50:00,948
Okay.

811
00:50:01,078 --> 00:50:04,908
Blondie, stay here
and baby-sit them two.

812
00:50:05,038 --> 00:50:07,748
White and Pink,
take a car each.

813
00:50:07,828 --> 00:50:11,378
I'll follow you. You ditch 'em.
Pick up the stones.

814
00:50:11,498 --> 00:50:14,628
While I'm followin' you, I'll arrange
some sort of a doctor for our friend.

815
00:50:14,718 --> 00:50:16,588
You can't leave these guys
here with him.

816
00:50:16,718 --> 00:50:20,138
- Why not?
- Because he's a fuckin' psycho.

817
00:50:21,308 --> 00:50:23,468
And if you think
Joe's pissed off...

818
00:50:23,598 --> 00:50:26,518
that ain't nothin' compared
to how pissed off I am at him...

819
00:50:26,518 --> 00:50:28,808
for puttin' me
in the same room as that bastard.

820
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:33,398
You see what I've been
puttin' up with, Eddie?

821
00:50:33,398 --> 00:50:38,488
I fuckin' walked in here,
I told these guys about stayin' put.

822
00:50:38,608 --> 00:50:41,618
Mr. White whips out his gun,
he's stickin' it in my face...

823
00:50:41,618 --> 00:50:45,498
callin' me a motherfucker,
sayin' he's gonna blow me away...

824
00:50:45,578 --> 00:50:47,788
and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

825
00:50:47,868 --> 00:50:51,208
He's the reason the joint
turned into a shootin' spree.

826
00:50:51,338 --> 00:50:53,838
What are you,
a fuckin' silent partner?

827
00:50:53,918 --> 00:50:55,798
Tell him!

828
00:50:55,798 --> 00:50:58,428
He went crazy in the store,
but he seems all right now.

829
00:50:59,548 --> 00:51:03,428
This is what he was doin':
bam, bam...

830
00:51:03,508 --> 00:51:06,228
bam, bam.

831
00:51:06,348 --> 00:51:08,638
Yeah, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.

832
00:51:08,638 --> 00:51:11,768
I told 'em not to touch
the fuckin' alarm, they did.

833
00:51:11,858 --> 00:51:16,358
If they hadn't have done what I told 'em
not to do, they'd still be alive.

834
00:51:18,108 --> 00:51:20,198
My fuckin' hero.

835
00:51:21,868 --> 00:51:23,948
Thanks.

836
00:51:23,948 --> 00:51:26,788
That's your excuse for going
on a kill-crazy rampage?

837
00:51:26,868 --> 00:51:28,868
I don't like alarms, Mr. White.

838
00:51:32,498 --> 00:51:34,798
What does it matter
who stays with the cop?

839
00:51:34,798 --> 00:51:36,878
We ain't lettin' him go.
He's seen everybody.

840
00:51:37,008 --> 00:51:39,088
I haven't been looking at you guys.

841
00:51:39,178 --> 00:51:41,588
Shut the fuck up, man!

842
00:51:41,588 --> 00:51:44,508
You guys should never have taken him
outta the trunk in the first place.

843
00:51:44,598 --> 00:51:48,678
- We tried to find out about the setup.
- There is no fuckin' setup!

844
00:51:48,678 --> 00:51:50,438
Now here's the news!

845
00:51:50,558 --> 00:51:53,558
Blondie, you stay here,
take care of these two!

846
00:51:53,688 --> 00:51:55,978
White and Pink, you come with me,
'cause if Joe gets here...

847
00:51:56,068 --> 00:51:58,148
and he sees all these
cars parked outside...

848
00:51:58,278 --> 00:52:01,278
I swear to you he's gonna be
just as mad at me as he is at you.

849
00:52:01,408 --> 00:52:03,488
Fine. Let's go.

850
00:52:24,218 --> 00:52:26,098
Alone at last.

851
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:49,998
Guess what.

852
00:52:49,998 --> 00:52:52,708
I think I'm parked in the red zone.

853
00:52:57,918 --> 00:53:00,628
Now, where were we?

854
00:53:02,088 --> 00:53:05,428
I told you, I don't know anything
about any fuckin' setup.

855
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:08,968
I've been on the force
for only eight months.

856
00:53:09,058 --> 00:53:11,268
They don't tell me anything.

857
00:53:12,808 --> 00:53:15,858
Nobody tells me shit.
You can torture me all you want.

858
00:53:15,938 --> 00:53:18,148
Torture you?
That's a good--

859
00:53:18,228 --> 00:53:21,358
That's a good idea.
I like that one, yeah.

860
00:53:22,948 --> 00:53:26,068
Even your boss said
there wasn't a setup.

861
00:53:27,618 --> 00:53:30,748
- My what?
- Your boss.

862
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:33,788
Excuse me, pal.

863
00:53:33,788 --> 00:53:37,838
One thing I wanna make clear to you:
I don't have a boss.

864
00:53:37,958 --> 00:53:40,958
Nobody tells me what to do.
You understand?

865
00:53:41,088 --> 00:53:43,588
You hear what I said,
you son of a bitch?

866
00:53:43,668 --> 00:53:46,718
All right, all right, all right,
you don't have a boss.

867
00:53:49,718 --> 00:53:51,928
Get that fuckin' shit off.

868
00:54:00,148 --> 00:54:03,278
Look, I'm not gonna
bullshit you, okay?

869
00:54:04,738 --> 00:54:07,988
I don't really give a good fuck
what you know or don't know...

870
00:54:09,328 --> 00:54:11,948
but I'm gonna
torture you anyway...

871
00:54:13,908 --> 00:54:15,498
regardless.

872
00:54:15,578 --> 00:54:17,788
Not to get information.

873
00:54:19,458 --> 00:54:21,418
It's amusing to me...

874
00:54:21,548 --> 00:54:23,918
to torture a cop.

875
00:54:23,918 --> 00:54:27,178
You can say anything you want
because I've heard it all before.

876
00:54:28,718 --> 00:54:31,008
All you can do is...

877
00:54:31,008 --> 00:54:33,218
pray for a quick death...

878
00:54:35,808 --> 00:54:38,438
which...

879
00:54:38,518 --> 00:54:40,728
you ain't gonna get.

880
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:57,708
Oh, God.

881
00:55:05,968 --> 00:55:10,008
You ever listen to K-BILLY's
"Super Sounds of the '70s"?

882
00:55:13,348 --> 00:55:15,638
It's my personal favorite.

883
00:55:21,898 --> 00:55:26,488
Joe Egan and Gerry Rafferty
were a duo known as Stealer's Wheel...

884
00:55:26,608 --> 00:55:30,658
when they recorded this Dylanesque,
pop, bubble-gum favorite...

885
00:55:30,778 --> 00:55:33,908
from April of 1974.

886
00:55:33,908 --> 00:55:35,868
That reached up to number five...

887
00:55:35,998 --> 00:55:39,328
as K-BILLY's "Super Sounds
of the '70s" continues.

888
00:56:28,338 --> 00:56:30,428
Hold still.

889
00:56:30,508 --> 00:56:32,588
Hold still, you fuck.

890
00:56:53,028 --> 00:56:55,528
Was that good for you too?

891
00:56:56,278 --> 00:56:58,038
Hey, what's goin' on?

892
00:56:58,158 --> 00:56:59,618
You hear that?

893
00:57:10,128 --> 00:57:12,548
Don't go anywhere.
I'll be right back.

894
00:58:56,698 --> 00:58:59,198
Don't! Stop! Stop!

895
00:59:00,578 --> 00:59:03,488
- What? What's the matter?
- Don't do this.

896
00:59:04,748 --> 00:59:06,708
That burn a little bit?

897
00:59:07,538 --> 00:59:09,208
Don't! Stop!

898
00:59:12,128 --> 00:59:13,918
Please stop.

899
00:59:13,918 --> 00:59:16,218
Just stop. Stop.

900
00:59:16,218 --> 00:59:18,178
Just talk to me.
Don't. Please.

901
00:59:18,298 --> 00:59:19,838
Don't burn me, please.

902
00:59:23,098 --> 00:59:26,638
I don't know anything about
any of you fucking guys.

903
00:59:26,848 --> 00:59:28,728
I'm not gonna say anything.

904
00:59:30,808 --> 00:59:32,068
No! Please, no.

905
00:59:32,148 --> 00:59:33,728
- You all through?
- Stop!

906
00:59:33,728 --> 00:59:34,858
You all through?

907
00:59:34,858 --> 00:59:38,398
Please.
I got a little kid at home.

908
00:59:39,028 --> 00:59:40,198
You all done?

909
00:59:40,198 --> 00:59:42,158
- Don't!
- Have some fire.

910
01:00:46,308 --> 01:00:48,268
Oh, shit.

911
01:00:50,348 --> 01:00:51,808
Hey, you.

912
01:00:54,648 --> 01:00:56,938
What's your name?

913
01:01:00,148 --> 01:01:01,398
Marvin.

914
01:01:03,488 --> 01:01:04,658
Marvin what?

915
01:01:08,908 --> 01:01:10,498
Marvin Nash.

916
01:01:16,958 --> 01:01:18,918
Listen to me, Marvin.
I'm a--

917
01:01:21,628 --> 01:01:24,678
Listen to me, Marvin Nash.
I'm a cop.

918
01:01:26,548 --> 01:01:28,308
Yeah, I know.

919
01:01:30,808 --> 01:01:32,388
You do?

920
01:01:33,518 --> 01:01:36,858
Yeah.
Your name's Freddy somethin'.

921
01:01:37,898 --> 01:01:39,478
Newendyke.

922
01:01:40,738 --> 01:01:42,698
Freddy Newendyke.

923
01:01:46,448 --> 01:01:48,738
Frankie Ferchetti...

924
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:52,708
introduced us
about five months ago.

925
01:01:55,628 --> 01:01:58,038
I don't remember that at all.

926
01:02:01,258 --> 01:02:03,128
I do.

927
01:02:06,178 --> 01:02:08,548
Freddy.

928
01:02:16,808 --> 01:02:18,768
How do I look?

929
01:02:21,478 --> 01:02:22,938
What?

930
01:02:30,578 --> 01:02:33,498
I don't know what to tell you,
Marvin.

931
01:02:37,038 --> 01:02:38,708
That fuck.

932
01:02:41,208 --> 01:02:43,588
That sick fuck!

933
01:02:43,718 --> 01:02:46,628
That fuckin' bastard!

934
01:02:48,508 --> 01:02:51,928
Marvin, I need you to hold on.

935
01:02:52,058 --> 01:02:54,978
There's cops waiting to move
a block away.

936
01:02:56,098 --> 01:02:59,148
What the fuck
are they waiting for?

937
01:02:59,228 --> 01:03:02,478
This fuckin' guy,
he slashes my face...

938
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,988
and cuts my fuckin' ear off!

939
01:03:05,068 --> 01:03:07,278
I'm fuckin' deformed!

940
01:03:07,278 --> 01:03:08,948
Fuck you!

941
01:03:10,278 --> 01:03:12,288
I'm fuckin' dyin' here!

942
01:03:12,368 --> 01:03:14,448
I'm fuckin' dyin'!

943
01:03:22,918 --> 01:03:26,878
They're not to make a move
'til Joe Cabot shows up.

944
01:03:26,968 --> 01:03:29,798
I was sent in to get him.

945
01:03:29,798 --> 01:03:31,468
All right?

946
01:03:31,468 --> 01:03:34,468
You heard 'em.
They said he's on his way.

947
01:03:34,468 --> 01:03:36,978
Don't pussy out on me now,
Marvin.

948
01:03:38,848 --> 01:03:41,148
We're just gonna sit here
and bleed...

949
01:03:41,268 --> 01:03:44,688
'til Joe Cabot sticks
his fuckin' head through that door.

950
01:04:05,458 --> 01:04:07,628
Say hello to a motherfucker
who's inside.

951
01:04:07,758 --> 01:04:10,548
Cabot's doing a job.
He wants me on the team.

952
01:04:10,678 --> 01:04:13,178
This better not be a joke.

953
01:04:13,178 --> 01:04:16,928
This ain't a joke.
I'm in. I'm up his ass.

954
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:27,438
Nice Guy Eddie tells me
Joe wants to meet me.

955
01:04:27,568 --> 01:04:31,408
He says I should just wait
for a phone call.

956
01:04:31,528 --> 01:04:35,908
After waiting three days he calls me
last night and says Joe's ready.

957
01:04:35,908 --> 01:04:38,908
- He'll pick me up in 15 minutes.
- Who picked you up?

958
01:04:39,038 --> 01:04:41,618
- Nice Guy. We get to a bar.
- What bar?

959
01:04:41,748 --> 01:04:43,288
Smokey Pete's in Gardena.

960
01:04:43,838 --> 01:04:44,878
We get there...

961
01:04:44,958 --> 01:04:47,878
and I meet Joe
and a guy named Mr. White.

962
01:04:48,088 --> 01:04:49,968
Phony name.
My name's Mr. Orange.

963
01:04:50,088 --> 01:04:52,798
- Mr. Orange?
- Mr. Orange.

964
01:04:54,048 --> 01:04:56,008
Okay, Mr. Orange.

965
01:04:56,008 --> 01:04:59,768
- You ever see this motherfucker before?
- Who? Mr. White?

966
01:04:59,768 --> 01:05:01,438
Yes. Mr. White.

967
01:05:02,188 --> 01:05:07,068
No. He ain't one of Cabot's men either.
He's gotta be from out of town.

968
01:05:07,188 --> 01:05:09,278
- Joe knows him good.
- How can you tell?

969
01:05:09,358 --> 01:05:12,408
The way they talk.
You can tell they're buddies.

970
01:05:12,488 --> 01:05:14,568
- You two talk?
- Me and Joe?

971
01:05:15,408 --> 01:05:16,658
Mr. White.

972
01:05:16,778 --> 01:05:18,328
- A little.
- About what?

973
01:05:18,328 --> 01:05:19,498
The Brewers.

974
01:05:19,498 --> 01:05:20,828
Milwaukee Brewers?

975
01:05:20,958 --> 01:05:24,078
They won the night before.
He made some money off them.

976
01:05:24,168 --> 01:05:28,958
Good. If this crook's a Brewers fan,
he's gotta be from Wisconsin.

977
01:05:29,088 --> 01:05:31,798
And I'll bet you everything...

978
01:05:31,878 --> 01:05:35,008
they got a sheet in Milwaukee
on this Mr. White's ass.

979
01:05:35,138 --> 01:05:39,388
So I want you to go through
everybody in Milwaukee...

980
01:05:39,388 --> 01:05:42,848
with a history of armed robbery
and put a name to the face.

981
01:05:42,938 --> 01:05:45,438
- Nice work, Freddy.
- Thank you, my man.

982
01:05:46,688 --> 01:05:49,188
- How was Long Beach Mike's referral?
- Perfect.

983
01:05:49,188 --> 01:05:53,488
His backing me up went a long way.
I told them I played poker with him.

984
01:05:53,568 --> 01:05:56,488
Nice Guy checked it out
and said it was A-okay.

985
01:05:56,618 --> 01:05:59,538
Said I was a good thief,
I didn't rattle...

986
01:05:59,618 --> 01:06:01,908
and that I was ready to move.

987
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:04,748
He's a good guy.
I wouldn't be inside without him.

988
01:06:06,708 --> 01:06:09,128
Long Beach Mike
is not your friend.

989
01:06:09,208 --> 01:06:11,508
Long Beach Mike
is a fucking scumbag.

990
01:06:11,508 --> 01:06:13,508
He's selling out his friends.

991
01:06:13,588 --> 01:06:16,428
That's how nice he fuckin' is.

992
01:06:16,428 --> 01:06:18,388
I'll take care of his ass...

993
01:06:18,508 --> 01:06:22,348
but you get that scumbag out of mind
and take care of business.

994
01:06:22,348 --> 01:06:24,018
Gone.

995
01:06:29,768 --> 01:06:31,728
Use the commode story?

996
01:06:31,858 --> 01:06:35,278
- What's the commode story?
- It's a scene. Memorize it.

997
01:06:37,158 --> 01:06:40,488
- A what?
- Undercover cops gotta be Brando.

998
01:06:40,618 --> 01:06:43,828
To do this job you gotta be
a great actor, naturalistic.

999
01:06:43,828 --> 01:06:46,668
You gotta be naturalistic as hell.

1000
01:06:46,668 --> 01:06:51,668
If you're a bad actor,
that's bullshit in this job.

1001
01:06:51,748 --> 01:06:53,128
What is this?

1002
01:06:53,128 --> 01:06:56,048
That's an amusing anecdote
about a drug deal.

1003
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:02,388
Something funny that happened to you
while you were doing a job.

1004
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:05,848
I gotta memorize all this?
There's four pages of this shit.

1005
01:07:05,938 --> 01:07:08,648
Think about it like it's a joke.

1006
01:07:08,648 --> 01:07:11,898
Memorize what's important.
The rest you make your own.

1007
01:07:11,898 --> 01:07:13,858
You can tell a joke,
can't you?

1008
01:07:15,028 --> 01:07:16,898
Well, pretend you're Don Rickles...

1009
01:07:16,988 --> 01:07:18,868
and tell a joke, all right?

1010
01:07:18,988 --> 01:07:21,778
The things you gotta remember
are the details.

1011
01:07:21,778 --> 01:07:23,868
The details sell your story.

1012
01:07:23,868 --> 01:07:26,998
This particular story
takes place in a men's room.

1013
01:07:26,998 --> 01:07:29,708
You gotta know
all the details--

1014
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:33,588
whether they got paper towels
or a blower to dry your hands.

1015
01:07:33,668 --> 01:07:37,338
You gotta know if the stalls
ain't got no doors or not.

1016
01:07:37,428 --> 01:07:40,468
You gotta know if they got liquid soap
or that pink, granulated shit...

1017
01:07:40,548 --> 01:07:42,558
they used in high school.

1018
01:07:42,558 --> 01:07:45,558
You gotta know if they got
hot water or not, if it stinks...

1019
01:07:45,558 --> 01:07:49,018
if some nasty, lowlife,
scum-ridden motherfucker...

1020
01:07:49,018 --> 01:07:51,398
sprayed diarrhea
all over one of the bowls.

1021
01:07:51,518 --> 01:07:54,938
You gotta know every detail
there is to know about this commode.

1022
01:07:54,938 --> 01:07:59,858
What you gotta do is take
all them details and make 'em your own.

1023
01:07:59,948 --> 01:08:03,828
While you're doing that, remember
that this story is about you...

1024
01:08:03,908 --> 01:08:07,158
and how you perceived
the events that went down.

1025
01:08:07,248 --> 01:08:09,118
The only way to do that...

1026
01:08:10,288 --> 01:08:12,168
is keep sayin' it...

1027
01:08:12,248 --> 01:08:14,668
and sayin' it and sayin' it.

1028
01:08:18,088 --> 01:08:23,008
This is during
the L.A. marijuana drought, 1986.

1029
01:08:23,008 --> 01:08:26,428
I still had a connection,
which was insane 'cause...

1030
01:08:26,428 --> 01:08:28,638
you couldn't get any weed
anywhere then.

1031
01:08:30,188 --> 01:08:34,148
Anyway, I had a connection with
this hippie chick in Santa Cruz...

1032
01:08:34,148 --> 01:08:36,148
and all my friends knew it.

1033
01:08:36,228 --> 01:08:38,858
They call me and say,
"Hey, Freddy--"

1034
01:08:40,528 --> 01:08:42,698
I say, "Hey, dude.

1035
01:08:43,948 --> 01:08:46,868
You gettin' some?
Can you get some for me too?"

1036
01:08:46,988 --> 01:08:51,788
They knew I still smoked,
so they asked me to buy some for them.

1037
01:08:51,788 --> 01:08:53,248
It got to be--

1038
01:08:58,878 --> 01:09:03,338
Every time I bought some weed
I was buyin' for four or five people.

1039
01:09:03,338 --> 01:09:07,928
Finally I said, fuck this shit.
I'm makin' this bitch rich.

1040
01:09:08,058 --> 01:09:11,388
She didn't even have to
meet these people.

1041
01:09:11,478 --> 01:09:13,478
I was doing all the work.

1042
01:09:13,478 --> 01:09:17,858
That got to be a pain in the ass,
people calling all the time.

1043
01:09:17,938 --> 01:09:21,608
I couldn't even rent a tape
without six fuckin' interruptions.

1044
01:09:21,698 --> 01:09:23,778
"When's the next time
you're gettin' some?"

1045
01:09:23,908 --> 01:09:26,278
"Motherfucker, I'm tryin'
to watch The Lost Boys.

1046
01:09:26,408 --> 01:09:28,288
When I get some,
I'll call you."

1047
01:09:29,408 --> 01:09:31,828
Then these rink-a-dink
potheads come by.

1048
01:09:31,828 --> 01:09:34,328
They're my friends and everything,
but still--

1049
01:09:34,418 --> 01:09:37,748
I got it laid out in 60-dollar bags,
they don't want 60 dollars worth.

1050
01:09:37,878 --> 01:09:41,218
They want ten dollars' worth,
and breaking it up wasn't easy.

1051
01:09:41,298 --> 01:09:44,968
I don't even know
what ten dollars' worth looks like.

1052
01:09:44,968 --> 01:09:47,138
This was a very weird situation.

1053
01:09:48,388 --> 01:09:50,598
Remember back in '86...

1054
01:09:50,598 --> 01:09:52,978
there was a major
fuckin' drought.

1055
01:09:53,098 --> 01:09:54,438
Nobody had anything.

1056
01:09:54,558 --> 01:09:57,898
People were livin' on resin,
smokin' the wood in their pipes.

1057
01:09:57,978 --> 01:10:01,858
This chick had a bunch
and she's beggin' me to sell it.

1058
01:10:01,938 --> 01:10:04,858
So I told her I wasn't gonna be
Joe the pot man anymore...

1059
01:10:04,988 --> 01:10:08,828
but I would take a little bit
and sell it to my close friends.

1060
01:10:08,948 --> 01:10:11,448
She agreed and we kept
the same arrangement as before--

1061
01:10:11,538 --> 01:10:13,408
ten percent
and free pot for me...

1062
01:10:13,538 --> 01:10:15,498
if I helped her
that weekend.

1063
01:10:15,498 --> 01:10:18,838
She was sellin' a brick of weed
and didn't wanna go to the buy alone.

1064
01:10:18,838 --> 01:10:22,378
Her brother usually goes with her,
but he's in County unexpectedly.

1065
01:10:22,508 --> 01:10:23,548
What for?

1066
01:10:23,628 --> 01:10:25,428
His traffic tickets
gone to warrant.

1067
01:10:25,508 --> 01:10:29,388
They stopped him, found warrants
on him, took him to County.

1068
01:10:29,388 --> 01:10:32,308
She doesn't wanna walk around alone
with all that weed.

1069
01:10:32,388 --> 01:10:36,148
I don't wanna do this.
I have a very bad feeling about it.

1070
01:10:36,268 --> 01:10:38,228
She keeps asking me, asking me.

1071
01:10:38,358 --> 01:10:41,278
Finally I said okay
'cause I'm sick of hearing it.

1072
01:10:41,278 --> 01:10:43,568
- So we go to the train station--
- Wait.

1073
01:10:43,648 --> 01:10:46,698
You're goin' to the train station
with the weed on ya?

1074
01:10:46,778 --> 01:10:48,868
The guy needed it right away.

1075
01:10:48,988 --> 01:10:51,368
Anyway, we get to
the train station...

1076
01:10:51,368 --> 01:10:53,368
and we're waitin' for the guy.

1077
01:10:53,368 --> 01:10:55,958
I'm carryin' the weed
in a carry-on bag.

1078
01:10:56,078 --> 01:11:00,748
I gotta take a piss, so I tell her
I'm goin' to the boy's room.

1079
01:11:05,048 --> 01:11:08,048
So I walk into the men's room
and who's standing there?

1080
01:11:09,638 --> 01:11:13,058
Four Los Angeles County sheriffs
and a German shepherd.

1081
01:11:15,268 --> 01:11:18,808
- They're waitin' for you?
- No, they're just talkin'.

1082
01:11:18,898 --> 01:11:21,818
When I walked in,
they all stopped talkin'...

1083
01:11:21,938 --> 01:11:24,318
and they looked at me.

1084
01:11:24,438 --> 01:11:27,158
That's hard.
That's a fuckin' hard situation.

1085
01:11:28,198 --> 01:11:29,868
German shepherd starts barking.

1086
01:11:31,618 --> 01:11:33,198
He's barkin' at me.

1087
01:11:33,288 --> 01:11:35,908
I mean, it's obvious
he's barkin' at me.

1088
01:11:37,788 --> 01:11:41,538
Every nerve ending, all of my senses,
the blood in the veins was screamin':

1089
01:11:41,628 --> 01:11:45,588
"Take off, man. Just bail.
Get the fuck outta there."

1090
01:11:45,718 --> 01:11:48,218
Panic hits me
like a bucket of water.

1091
01:11:48,298 --> 01:11:49,758
Bam! Right in the face.

1092
01:11:49,888 --> 01:11:54,768
I'm drenched in panic and these cops
are lookin' at me and they know it.

1093
01:11:54,888 --> 01:11:58,228
They can smell it,
sure as that fuckin' dog can.

1094
01:11:58,308 --> 01:12:00,308
They can smell it on me.

1095
01:12:01,148 --> 01:12:02,688
Shut up.

1096
01:12:04,068 --> 01:12:07,198
So anyway,
I got my gun drawn.

1097
01:12:07,278 --> 01:12:10,198
I point it at this guy
and I tell him...

1098
01:12:10,198 --> 01:12:12,698
"Freeze.
Don't fuckin' move."

1099
01:12:12,828 --> 01:12:15,748
This little idiot's
looking right at me and saying...

1100
01:12:15,828 --> 01:12:17,618
"I know, I know."

1101
01:12:17,708 --> 01:12:21,168
But meanwhile his right hand
is creepin' toward the glove box.

1102
01:12:21,248 --> 01:12:26,048
I scream at him, "Asshole!
I'm gonna blow you away right now!

1103
01:12:26,168 --> 01:12:28,258
Put your hands on the dash."

1104
01:12:28,258 --> 01:12:31,388
He's still looking at me,
nodding his head.

1105
01:12:31,388 --> 01:12:33,758
"I know, buddy, I know."

1106
01:12:33,758 --> 01:12:37,518
Meanwhile his hand is still
going for the glove box.

1107
01:12:37,638 --> 01:12:39,308
And I said...

1108
01:12:39,308 --> 01:12:43,268
"Buddy, I'm gonna shoot you
in the face...

1109
01:12:43,268 --> 01:12:45,978
if you don't put your hands up."

1110
01:12:47,528 --> 01:12:51,608
Then this guy's girlfriend,
this real sexy Oriental bitch...

1111
01:12:51,698 --> 01:12:54,948
she starts screaming at him:
"Chuck, what are you doin'?

1112
01:12:54,948 --> 01:12:58,288
Listen to the officer!
Put your hands on the dash!"

1113
01:12:58,368 --> 01:13:02,538
So then the guy snaps out of it
and puts his hands on the dash.

1114
01:13:02,668 --> 01:13:03,998
What was he goin' for?

1115
01:13:04,128 --> 01:13:06,418
His fucking registration.

1116
01:13:07,668 --> 01:13:09,338
- You're kidding.
- No, man!

1117
01:13:09,338 --> 01:13:12,968
Stupid citizen doesn't know how close
he came to gettin' blown away.

1118
01:13:13,088 --> 01:13:14,548
That close, man.

1119
01:13:48,128 --> 01:13:50,088
You knew how to handle
that situation.

1120
01:13:50,088 --> 01:13:53,008
You shit your pants,
dive in and swim.

1121
01:13:55,638 --> 01:13:57,598
Tell me more about Cabot.

1122
01:13:57,718 --> 01:13:59,468
I don't know.

1123
01:13:59,598 --> 01:14:01,558
He's a cool guy.

1124
01:14:03,348 --> 01:14:05,938
He's funny.
He's a funny guy.

1125
01:14:06,768 --> 01:14:08,978
You remember
the Fantastic Four?

1126
01:14:10,028 --> 01:14:11,898
Yeah, with that invisible bitch...

1127
01:14:11,988 --> 01:14:13,988
and "Flame on"
and shit, right?

1128
01:14:15,108 --> 01:14:16,368
Thing.

1129
01:14:16,988 --> 01:14:18,368
Motherfucker...

1130
01:14:18,448 --> 01:14:20,328
Iooks just like the Thing.

1131
01:14:24,618 --> 01:14:27,208
Hey! Showtime!

1132
01:14:27,208 --> 01:14:30,128
Grab your jacket.
I'm parked outside.

1133
01:14:30,248 --> 01:14:32,128
I'll be right down.

1134
01:14:33,588 --> 01:14:34,838
He'll be right down.

1135
01:15:54,798 --> 01:15:57,008
Don't pussy out on me now.

1136
01:15:57,008 --> 01:15:58,968
They don't know.

1137
01:15:58,968 --> 01:16:01,258
They don't know shit.

1138
01:16:01,258 --> 01:16:04,388
You're not gonna get hurt.
You're fuckin' Baretta.

1139
01:16:04,518 --> 01:16:07,938
They believe every fuckin' word
'cause you're super cool.

1140
01:16:15,358 --> 01:16:16,818
There goes our boy.

1141
01:16:16,818 --> 01:16:19,948
The guy has to have rocks in his head
the size of Gibraltar...

1142
01:16:20,028 --> 01:16:21,488
to work undercover.

1143
01:16:21,618 --> 01:16:24,538
- You want one of these?
- Yeah, give me the bear claw.

1144
01:16:40,588 --> 01:16:42,548
I know what I'm talking about.

1145
01:16:42,548 --> 01:16:45,258
Black women ain't the same
as white women.

1146
01:16:45,258 --> 01:16:46,718
There's a slight difference.

1147
01:16:46,848 --> 01:16:49,558
Very funny.
You know what I mean.

1148
01:16:49,638 --> 01:16:53,108
What a white bitch will put up with,
a black bitch wouldn't for a minute.

1149
01:16:53,188 --> 01:16:56,028
If you cross their line,
they fuck you up.

1150
01:16:56,108 --> 01:16:58,738
I gotta go along with Pink
on that.

1151
01:16:58,738 --> 01:17:01,528
Okay, Mr. Expert,
if this is such a truism...

1152
01:17:01,528 --> 01:17:06,038
why is it that every nigger I know
treats his woman like a piece of shit?

1153
01:17:06,118 --> 01:17:09,578
I'll bet those same niggers
who show their ass in public...

1154
01:17:09,658 --> 01:17:12,578
when their bitches get 'em home
they chill the fuck out.

1155
01:17:12,578 --> 01:17:15,708
- Not these guys.
- Oh, yeah. Those guys too.

1156
01:17:15,838 --> 01:17:17,798
Tell you guys a story.

1157
01:17:17,918 --> 01:17:22,718
In one of Daddy's clubs there's
a black cocktail waitress named Elois.

1158
01:17:22,718 --> 01:17:24,798
- Elois?
- Yeah, Elois.

1159
01:17:24,888 --> 01:17:28,428
E and Lois.
We called her Lady E.

1160
01:17:28,558 --> 01:17:30,438
Where was she from?
Compton?

1161
01:17:32,518 --> 01:17:33,978
She's from Ladora Heights.

1162
01:17:34,058 --> 01:17:36,478
Ladora Heights.
The black Beverly Hills.

1163
01:17:37,608 --> 01:17:39,898
It's not
the black Beverly Hills.

1164
01:17:39,898 --> 01:17:42,528
It's the black Palos Verdes.

1165
01:17:42,608 --> 01:17:44,408
Anyway...

1166
01:17:44,488 --> 01:17:48,868
Lady E, she was a man-eater-upper.
Un-fuckin'-believable.

1167
01:17:48,868 --> 01:17:53,788
Every guy who ever saw her
had to jack off to her at least once.

1168
01:17:53,788 --> 01:17:56,788
You know who she looked like?
Christie Love.

1169
01:17:56,788 --> 01:17:58,798
Remember that TV show
Get Christie Love...

1170
01:17:58,798 --> 01:18:01,168
about the black female cop?

1171
01:18:01,168 --> 01:18:04,088
She always used to say,
"You're under arrest, sugar! "

1172
01:18:06,298 --> 01:18:09,098
- Who played Christie Love?
- Pam Grier.

1173
01:18:09,098 --> 01:18:12,138
No, it wasn't Pam Grier.
Pam Grier was the other one.

1174
01:18:12,138 --> 01:18:14,098
Pam Grier did the film.

1175
01:18:14,098 --> 01:18:18,818
Christie Love was like
a Pam Grier TV show without Pam Grier.

1176
01:18:18,898 --> 01:18:22,148
- So, who was Christie Love?
- How should I know?

1177
01:18:22,148 --> 01:18:24,108
Great. Now I'm totally
fuckin' tortured.

1178
01:18:24,108 --> 01:18:27,448
Whoever it was,
she looked exactly like Elois.

1179
01:18:27,578 --> 01:18:28,908
Anne Francis.

1180
01:18:29,038 --> 01:18:31,748
No. That was Honey West.

1181
01:18:31,828 --> 01:18:33,498
Anne Francis is white.

1182
01:18:33,618 --> 01:18:37,878
I'm tryin' to tell a story here.
She looked exactly like Elois.

1183
01:18:37,998 --> 01:18:40,508
We come into the club
one night...

1184
01:18:40,588 --> 01:18:42,468
and there's Carlos,
the bartender.

1185
01:18:42,588 --> 01:18:45,718
He's a wetback.
He's a friend of mine.

1186
01:18:45,798 --> 01:18:48,428
I says to him,
"Carlos, where's Lady E tonight?"

1187
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,558
Apparently Lady E...

1188
01:18:51,638 --> 01:18:54,978
was married to real piece
of dog shit, a real animal.

1189
01:18:54,978 --> 01:18:57,188
He used to do things to her.

1190
01:18:57,268 --> 01:18:59,268
Like what?
What would he do?

1191
01:18:59,358 --> 01:19:01,028
Beat her up?

1192
01:19:01,778 --> 01:19:03,948
I don't know.
He just did things.

1193
01:19:04,068 --> 01:19:07,698
So anyway, one night
she plays it real cool.

1194
01:19:07,818 --> 01:19:10,118
She waits for him to get drunk.

1195
01:19:10,328 --> 01:19:13,248
He falls asleep
on the fuckin' couch.

1196
01:19:13,248 --> 01:19:17,498
She sneaks up on him,
puts some glue on his dick...

1197
01:19:17,628 --> 01:19:19,788
and glues his dick
to his belly.

1198
01:19:20,958 --> 01:19:22,628
Jesus Christ!

1199
01:19:22,708 --> 01:19:25,548
I'm serious, man.
I'm dead serious.

1200
01:19:25,628 --> 01:19:28,968
They had to call the paramedics
to cut the prick loose.

1201
01:19:30,218 --> 01:19:32,218
Was he all pissed off?

1202
01:19:34,178 --> 01:19:38,478
How would you feel if you had to do
a fuckin' handstand to take a piss?

1203
01:19:42,728 --> 01:19:46,698
You guys like to tell jokes
and giggle and kid around, huh?

1204
01:19:46,818 --> 01:19:49,738
Giggling like a bunch of girls
in the schoolyard.

1205
01:19:49,738 --> 01:19:51,698
Well, let me tell a joke.

1206
01:19:52,738 --> 01:19:55,458
Five guys
sittin' in a bullpen...

1207
01:19:55,578 --> 01:19:57,328
San Quentin...

1208
01:19:57,458 --> 01:20:00,378
wonderin' how the fuck
they got there.

1209
01:20:00,458 --> 01:20:03,798
"What did we do wrong?
What shouldn't we have done?

1210
01:20:03,918 --> 01:20:05,798
It's your fault, his fault--"

1211
01:20:05,878 --> 01:20:07,678
All that bullshit.

1212
01:20:07,678 --> 01:20:09,428
Finally somebody says...

1213
01:20:09,548 --> 01:20:11,718
"Wait a minute.

1214
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:13,808
While we were
planning this caper...

1215
01:20:13,928 --> 01:20:16,428
we just sat around
tellin' fuckin' jokes."

1216
01:20:16,518 --> 01:20:18,188
Got the message?

1217
01:20:20,478 --> 01:20:22,478
I don't mean to holler at ya.

1218
01:20:23,938 --> 01:20:27,068
When this caper's over,
and I'm sure it'll be successful...

1219
01:20:27,148 --> 01:20:30,488
we'll go down to Hawaiian lslands,
I'll laugh with all of youse.

1220
01:20:30,618 --> 01:20:32,698
Find me a different character
down there.

1221
01:20:32,698 --> 01:20:35,078
Right now it's a matter
of business.

1222
01:20:36,248 --> 01:20:38,618
With the exception
of Eddie and myself...

1223
01:20:38,748 --> 01:20:40,498
who you already know...

1224
01:20:40,628 --> 01:20:43,418
we're gonna be using aliases
on this job.

1225
01:20:43,418 --> 01:20:45,918
Under no circumstances...

1226
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:49,258
do we want any one of you
to relate to each other...

1227
01:20:49,258 --> 01:20:51,468
by your Christian names.

1228
01:20:51,548 --> 01:20:55,928
And I don't want any talk
about yourself personally.

1229
01:20:56,058 --> 01:20:59,888
That includes where you been,
your wife's name...

1230
01:21:00,018 --> 01:21:01,978
where you might've done time...

1231
01:21:01,978 --> 01:21:05,858
or a bank maybe you robbed
in St. Petersburg.

1232
01:21:05,938 --> 01:21:09,818
All I want you guys to talk about,
if you have to...

1233
01:21:09,898 --> 01:21:12,528
is what you're gonna do.

1234
01:21:12,618 --> 01:21:14,828
That should do it.

1235
01:21:14,828 --> 01:21:17,328
These are your names--

1236
01:21:17,328 --> 01:21:20,328
Mr. Brown, Mr. White...

1237
01:21:20,328 --> 01:21:22,748
Mr. Blonde, Mr. Blue...

1238
01:21:22,828 --> 01:21:25,038
Mr. Orange and Mr. Pink.

1239
01:21:25,128 --> 01:21:28,798
- Why am I Mr. Pink?
- Because you're a faggot! All right?

1240
01:21:30,548 --> 01:21:33,048
- Why can't we pick our own colors?
- No way.

1241
01:21:33,048 --> 01:21:35,758
No way. Tried it once.
It doesn't work.

1242
01:21:35,758 --> 01:21:39,228
You get four guys all fightin'
over who gets to be Mr. Black.

1243
01:21:39,308 --> 01:21:42,768
They don't know each other,
so nobody wants to back down.

1244
01:21:42,848 --> 01:21:45,148
No way. I pick.
You're Mr. Pink.

1245
01:21:45,268 --> 01:21:47,358
Be thankful
you're not Mr. Yellow.

1246
01:21:48,478 --> 01:21:50,778
But Mr. Brown,
that's too close to Mr. Shit.

1247
01:21:50,898 --> 01:21:52,778
Mr. Pink
sounds like Mr. Pussy.

1248
01:21:52,858 --> 01:21:54,738
How about Mr. Purple?

1249
01:21:54,868 --> 01:21:56,828
That's sounds good.
I'll be Mr. Purple.

1250
01:21:56,948 --> 01:21:59,328
You're not Mr. Purple.

1251
01:21:59,448 --> 01:22:03,618
Some guy on some other job
is Mr. Purple. You're Mr. Pink!

1252
01:22:03,708 --> 01:22:05,498
Who cares what your name is?

1253
01:22:05,588 --> 01:22:09,258
Easy for you to say. You're Mr. White.
You have a cool-sounding name.

1254
01:22:09,258 --> 01:22:13,008
If it's no big deal to be Mr. Pink,
you wanna trade?

1255
01:22:13,088 --> 01:22:15,798
Nobody's tradin' with anybody.

1256
01:22:15,928 --> 01:22:19,058
This ain't a goddamn fuckin'
city council meeting, you know.

1257
01:22:20,928 --> 01:22:22,888
Now listen up, Mr. Pink.

1258
01:22:22,888 --> 01:22:25,398
There's two ways you can go
on this job--

1259
01:22:25,518 --> 01:22:27,818
my way or the highway.

1260
01:22:27,818 --> 01:22:29,898
What's it gonna be, Mr. Pink?

1261
01:22:30,738 --> 01:22:33,648
Jesus Christ, Joe.
Fuckin' forget about it.

1262
01:22:33,648 --> 01:22:36,368
It's beneath me.
I'm Mr. Pink. Let's move on.

1263
01:22:36,448 --> 01:22:39,368
I'll move on
when I feel like it.

1264
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:42,408
Do all you guys
got the goddamn message?

1265
01:22:43,958 --> 01:22:47,918
I'm so goddamn mad hollerin'
at you guys, I can hardly talk.

1266
01:22:49,378 --> 01:22:51,458
Let's go to work.

1267
01:22:51,588 --> 01:22:54,378
Let's go over it.
Where are you?

1268
01:22:54,378 --> 01:22:58,048
I stand outside and guard the door.
I don't let anybody go in or out.

1269
01:22:58,758 --> 01:23:00,968
- Mr. Brown.
- He waits in the car.

1270
01:23:00,968 --> 01:23:04,518
I give him the signal,
he pulls up in front.

1271
01:23:04,598 --> 01:23:06,808
Mr. Blonde and Mr. Blue.

1272
01:23:06,898 --> 01:23:10,568
Crowd control. They handle
the customers and the employees.

1273
01:23:10,568 --> 01:23:13,778
- That girl's ass.
- Sittin' right here on my dick.

1274
01:23:16,278 --> 01:23:18,158
Myself and Mr. Pink?

1275
01:23:18,368 --> 01:23:22,448
You two take the manager
and make him give you the diamonds.

1276
01:23:22,538 --> 01:23:24,618
We're there
for those stones, period.

1277
01:23:24,748 --> 01:23:28,168
Since no display cases are being
fucked with, no alarms should go off.

1278
01:23:29,418 --> 01:23:32,458
We're out in two minutes,
not one second longer.

1279
01:23:33,588 --> 01:23:36,508
What if the manager
won't give you the diamonds?

1280
01:23:37,678 --> 01:23:41,098
A store like this
is insured up the ass.

1281
01:23:41,218 --> 01:23:44,138
They're not supposed to give you
any resistance whatsoever.

1282
01:23:44,228 --> 01:23:47,978
If you get a customer or an employee
who thinks he's Charles Bronson...

1283
01:23:48,098 --> 01:23:50,398
smash their nose with your gun.

1284
01:23:50,478 --> 01:23:52,978
Drops him right to the floor.
Everyone jumps.

1285
01:23:53,108 --> 01:23:56,028
He falls down screaming,
blood squirts out of his nose.

1286
01:23:56,028 --> 01:23:58,948
Freaks everybody out.
Nobody says fuckin' shit after that.

1287
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,578
Some bitch might
talk shit to you.

1288
01:24:02,698 --> 01:24:06,658
Give her a look like she's next.
Watch her shut the fuck up.

1289
01:24:07,788 --> 01:24:10,418
If it's the manager,
that's different.

1290
01:24:10,498 --> 01:24:12,798
The managers know not
to fuck around...

1291
01:24:12,798 --> 01:24:15,208
so if he's giving you static...

1292
01:24:15,208 --> 01:24:19,468
he probably thinks he's a real cowboy
so you gotta that bastard in two.

1293
01:24:19,468 --> 01:24:23,428
If he won't tell ya something,
cut off one of his fingers.

1294
01:24:23,428 --> 01:24:26,768
The little one.
Then tell him his thumb's next.

1295
01:24:26,888 --> 01:24:29,808
After that he'll tell you
if he wears ladies underwear.

1296
01:24:33,778 --> 01:24:35,738
I'm hungry.
Let's get a taco.

1297
01:24:51,378 --> 01:24:52,338
Fuck.

1298
01:25:10,898 --> 01:25:12,558
Jesus.

1299
01:25:12,648 --> 01:25:14,858
I'm blind, man.
I'm fuckin' blind.

1300
01:25:14,938 --> 01:25:17,358
No, you just got
blood in your eyes.

1301
01:25:30,578 --> 01:25:31,828
Is he dead?

1302
01:25:33,288 --> 01:25:35,168
Did he die or not?

1303
01:25:36,418 --> 01:25:37,798
Let's go.

1304
01:26:12,498 --> 01:26:14,788
Hold it! Get out!

1305
01:26:16,458 --> 01:26:18,338
Get out of the fuckin' car!

1306
01:26:33,898 --> 01:26:36,058
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, Larry.

1307
01:26:37,108 --> 01:26:39,108
I can't believe she killed me.

1308
01:26:39,188 --> 01:26:40,778
Who'd have fucking thought that?

1309
01:26:40,778 --> 01:26:43,488
Hey, just cancel that shit
right now.

1310
01:26:43,488 --> 01:26:46,408
You're hurt.
You're hurt real fuckin' bad.

1311
01:26:46,488 --> 01:26:48,278
But you ain't dying.

1312
01:26:49,538 --> 01:26:52,458
All this blood's scaring
the shit out of me, Larry.

1313
01:26:53,788 --> 01:26:55,668
I'm gonna die.
I know it.

1314
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:32,288
What the fuck happened?

1315
01:27:32,368 --> 01:27:36,328
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1316
01:27:37,578 --> 01:27:39,788
What? I didn't hear you.

1317
01:27:39,878 --> 01:27:41,338
I said...

1318
01:27:43,128 --> 01:27:44,668
Blonde went crazy.

1319
01:27:44,798 --> 01:27:50,098
He slashed the cop's face, cut off
his ear and was gonna burn him alive.

1320
01:27:50,098 --> 01:27:51,348
This cop?

1321
01:27:56,478 --> 01:27:58,558
He went crazy?
Something like that?

1322
01:27:58,648 --> 01:28:00,728
Worse or better?

1323
01:28:00,728 --> 01:28:03,988
Eddie, he was
pulling a burn, man.

1324
01:28:05,238 --> 01:28:07,198
He was gonna kill
the cop and me.

1325
01:28:07,318 --> 01:28:11,158
When you guys walked in, he was gonna
kill you and run with the diamonds.

1326
01:28:11,778 --> 01:28:12,948
What'd I tell ya?

1327
01:28:12,948 --> 01:28:16,578
That sick piece of shit
was a stone-cold psycho.

1328
01:28:16,578 --> 01:28:19,828
You should've asked the cop,
not just killed him.

1329
01:28:19,918 --> 01:28:23,588
He talked about what he was gonna do
when he was slicing him up.

1330
01:28:25,128 --> 01:28:26,918
I don't buy it.

1331
01:28:26,918 --> 01:28:28,378
Doesn't make sense.

1332
01:28:32,638 --> 01:28:35,138
Makes perfect fuckin' sense
to me.

1333
01:28:35,138 --> 01:28:38,688
You didn't see how he acted
during the job. We did.

1334
01:28:38,808 --> 01:28:40,978
He's right.
The ear's hacked off.

1335
01:28:41,108 --> 01:28:45,278
Let me just say this out loud,
'cause I wanna get this straight.

1336
01:28:46,188 --> 01:28:48,198
You're saying that Mr. Blonde...

1337
01:28:48,198 --> 01:28:49,318
was gonna kill you...

1338
01:28:49,448 --> 01:28:52,658
and then when we got back
he was gonna kill us...

1339
01:28:52,658 --> 01:28:54,658
take the diamonds and scram.

1340
01:28:54,738 --> 01:28:57,868
I'm right about that, right?
That's your story?

1341
01:28:58,618 --> 01:29:00,578
I swear on my mother's soul...

1342
01:29:00,578 --> 01:29:02,248
that's what happened.

1343
01:29:03,208 --> 01:29:06,208
The man you killed
just got released from prison.

1344
01:29:06,208 --> 01:29:09,338
He got caught at a company warehouse
full of hot items.

1345
01:29:09,338 --> 01:29:12,048
He could've fuckin' walked.

1346
01:29:12,048 --> 01:29:16,218
All he had to do was say my dad's name,
but he didn't; he kept his mouth shut.

1347
01:29:16,348 --> 01:29:19,478
He did his fuckin' time
like a man.

1348
01:29:19,478 --> 01:29:21,768
He did four years for us.

1349
01:29:21,848 --> 01:29:24,268
So, Mr. Orange...

1350
01:29:24,358 --> 01:29:27,398
you're telling me
that this good friend of mine...

1351
01:29:27,398 --> 01:29:30,198
who did four years
for my father...

1352
01:29:30,318 --> 01:29:35,198
who, in four years, never made a deal,
no matter what they offered him...

1353
01:29:35,328 --> 01:29:38,328
you're telling me that
now that he's free...

1354
01:29:38,448 --> 01:29:41,368
and we're making good
on our commitment to him...

1355
01:29:41,458 --> 01:29:46,048
he's just gonna decide,
out of the fucking blue...

1356
01:29:46,168 --> 01:29:48,128
to rip us off?

1357
01:29:49,798 --> 01:29:53,138
Why don't you tell me
what really happened.

1358
01:29:53,258 --> 01:29:54,928
What the hell for?

1359
01:29:56,058 --> 01:29:57,928
It'd just be more bullshit.

1360
01:30:00,138 --> 01:30:02,018
This man set us up.

1361
01:30:03,268 --> 01:30:06,398
Dad, I'm sorry,
but I don't know what's happening.

1362
01:30:06,398 --> 01:30:10,148
- It's all right. I do.
- What are you talking about?

1363
01:30:10,238 --> 01:30:13,908
That lump of shit's workin'
with the L.A.P.D.

1364
01:30:15,238 --> 01:30:18,578
I don't have the slightest
fucking idea...

1365
01:30:18,698 --> 01:30:20,038
what you're talking about.

1366
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:23,708
Joe, I don't know what you think
you know, but you're wrong.

1367
01:30:23,788 --> 01:30:25,588
Like hell I am.

1368
01:30:25,668 --> 01:30:28,798
Trust me on this.
You've made a mistake.

1369
01:30:28,798 --> 01:30:30,588
He's a good kid.

1370
01:30:30,588 --> 01:30:33,178
I understand
you're super-fuckin'-pissed.

1371
01:30:33,298 --> 01:30:35,048
We're all real emotional.

1372
01:30:35,178 --> 01:30:39,348
But you're barking up the wrong tree.
I know him. He wouldn't do that.

1373
01:30:39,428 --> 01:30:41,018
You don't know jack shit!

1374
01:30:41,018 --> 01:30:42,268
I do.

1375
01:30:42,268 --> 01:30:44,228
The cocksucker
tipped off the cops...

1376
01:30:44,348 --> 01:30:46,438
and got Mr. Brown
and Mr. Blue killed.

1377
01:30:46,518 --> 01:30:49,438
- Mr. Blue is dead?
- Dead as Dillinger.

1378
01:30:49,568 --> 01:30:51,528
How do you know all this?

1379
01:30:51,648 --> 01:30:55,068
He was the only one
I wasn't 100 percent on.

1380
01:30:55,068 --> 01:30:58,408
I should have my head examined,
going ahead when I wasn't 100 percent.

1381
01:30:58,528 --> 01:31:02,288
- That's your proof?
- With instinct, you don't need proof.

1382
01:31:02,368 --> 01:31:04,668
I ignored it before,
but no more.

1383
01:31:06,958 --> 01:31:09,378
Have you lost your fuckin' mind?

1384
01:31:09,378 --> 01:31:12,168
I'm not gonna let you make
a terrible mistake.

1385
01:31:12,298 --> 01:31:15,218
Come on, guys.
Nobody wants this.

1386
01:31:15,298 --> 01:31:17,178
We're supposed to be
fuckin' professionals.

1387
01:31:18,138 --> 01:31:20,008
Larry, look...

1388
01:31:20,008 --> 01:31:21,968
it's been quite a long time.

1389
01:31:22,098 --> 01:31:23,428
A lot of jobs.

1390
01:31:23,558 --> 01:31:26,558
There's no need for this, man.

1391
01:31:26,688 --> 01:31:29,068
Let's just put our guns down...

1392
01:31:30,228 --> 01:31:31,978
and let's settle this...

1393
01:31:31,978 --> 01:31:33,648
with a fucking conversation.

1394
01:31:33,778 --> 01:31:37,198
Joe, if you kill that man,
you die next.

1395
01:31:37,318 --> 01:31:39,488
Repeat: you kill him,
you die next.

1396
01:31:39,618 --> 01:31:42,828
Larry, we have been friends.

1397
01:31:42,948 --> 01:31:45,118
You respect my dad
and I respect you...

1398
01:31:45,248 --> 01:31:47,128
but I'll put bullets
in you.

1399
01:31:47,208 --> 01:31:49,418
You put that fuckin' gun
down now.

1400
01:31:50,248 --> 01:31:52,548
Goddamn you, Joe...

1401
01:31:52,628 --> 01:31:54,088
don't make me do this.

1402
01:31:54,088 --> 01:31:56,718
Larry, you stop pointin' that gun
at my dad!

1403
01:33:43,568 --> 01:33:45,448
I'm sorry, kid.

1404
01:33:47,868 --> 01:33:49,828
Looks like we're gonna...

1405
01:33:51,208 --> 01:33:53,078
do a little time.

1406
01:33:59,628 --> 01:34:01,508
I'm a cop.

1407
01:34:03,298 --> 01:34:05,258
Larry...

1408
01:34:06,508 --> 01:34:08,518
I'm sorry.

1409
01:34:09,638 --> 01:34:11,438
I'm...

1410
01:34:11,518 --> 01:34:13,598
so sorry.

1411
01:34:16,518 --> 01:34:18,938
I'm a cop.

1412
01:34:36,038 --> 01:34:37,498
I'm sorry.

1413
01:34:49,178 --> 01:34:50,638
I'm sorry.

1414
01:34:52,188 --> 01:34:53,978
I'm...

1415
01:34:53,978 --> 01:34:55,228
sorr--

1416
01:34:58,018 --> 01:34:59,068
Freeze!

1417
01:34:59,188 --> 01:35:01,148
Drop the fucking gun, buddy!

1418
01:35:01,148 --> 01:35:03,148
- Now!
- Put the gun down!

1419
01:35:03,238 --> 01:35:06,068
- Don't do it!
- Drop the gun, man!

1420
01:35:06,158 --> 01:35:09,408
- Drop the fucking gun!
- We're gonna blow you away!
