00:02:31,092 --> 00:02:32,814
GUNS SMUGGLED INTO HONG KONG

2
00:02:37,801 --> 00:02:39,657
Is your wife worried about you?

3
00:02:39,797 --> 00:02:43,463
She's used to it, but she still prays
every time I'm on a job.

4
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:44,494
Be good to her.

5
00:02:44,504 --> 00:02:50,364
WUEN LOI RESTAURANT

6
00:02:53,622 --> 00:02:55,345
Good morning. Up so early?

7
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:59,246
–How many Playboys are you reading?
–I don't read the articles.

8
00:02:59,286 --> 00:03:00,279
Be serious.

9
00:03:00,531 --> 00:03:02,058
Are the “bird men” here?

10
00:03:02,098 --> 00:03:05,345
–Three are, but not the “bird king”.
–Keep watch.

11
00:03:27,605 --> 00:03:29,859
<i>Lionheart, can you hear me?</i>

12
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,983
<i>What's happening over there?</i>

13
00:03:32,024 --> 00:03:33,588
<i>Something big.</i>

14
00:03:34,594 --> 00:03:35,787
<i>Stay alert.</i>

15
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:38,029
<i>This is the real thing.</i>

16
00:03:45,842 --> 00:03:46,915
Sponge pudding.

17
00:03:47,971 --> 00:03:50,224
Have you thought about emigrating?

18
00:03:51,024 --> 00:03:52,348
I haven't.

19
00:03:52,590 --> 00:03:55,374
This is my home.
I want to be buried here.

20
00:03:55,603 --> 00:03:57,591
I can't adjust to life abroad.

21
00:03:58,053 --> 00:04:00,505
You can't get dim sum in the morning.

22
00:04:02,110 --> 00:04:05,623
–You can get dim sum abroad.
–We've got the original.

23
00:04:14,804 --> 00:04:16,882
Your son must be growing up.

24
00:04:17,776 --> 00:04:19,825
He's seven now.
I'll show you a photo.

25
00:04:19,865 --> 00:04:20,858
OK.

26
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,840
–We've been waiting.
–We were in Shenzhen.

27
00:04:23,962 --> 00:04:24,842
Sit down.

28
00:04:29,064 --> 00:04:31,914
–I've got some good stuff.
–Is it any good?

29
00:04:31,996 --> 00:04:33,719
Don't pay if it's no good.

30
00:04:33,924 --> 00:04:35,123
I can't find it.

31
00:04:51,839 --> 00:04:55,087
One shot and the cops
won't know what's hit them.

32
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:58,417
–Really?
–It's a bargain.

33
00:04:58,628 --> 00:05:02,123
The bullet can go through two
oil barrels and still kill someone.

34
00:05:02,163 --> 00:05:04,893
Are they really that great?

35
00:05:05,296 --> 00:05:07,682
<i>We have nothing but the best.</i>

36
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:26,288
We'll get rich together.

37
00:05:34,097 --> 00:05:35,251
My treat.

38
00:05:48,438 --> 00:05:49,591
Freeze! Police!

39
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:51,384
Stay where you are!

40
00:05:52,294 --> 00:05:53,127
Move!

41
00:06:12,378 --> 00:06:14,263
–Are you OK?
–I'm fine.

42
00:06:45,478 --> 00:06:46,671
Move, you bastard!

43
00:06:47,888 --> 00:06:48,802
Move!

44
00:06:50,057 --> 00:06:51,336
Get down!

45
00:07:41,554 --> 00:07:42,958
Old bastard!

46
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,158
Move!

47
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,310
Get down! Get down!

48
00:08:24,735 --> 00:08:25,775
Don't come in!

49
00:08:59,562 --> 00:09:01,207
Are you OK?

50
00:09:07,957 --> 00:09:09,216
Get out of the way!

51
00:10:23,796 --> 00:10:26,367
You're really quite something.

52
00:10:27,572 --> 00:10:31,019
Every time you fire a gun,
you never waste a bullet.

53
00:10:36,008 --> 00:10:37,797
Do you know who you killed?

54
00:10:39,542 --> 00:10:40,470
I'll tell you…

55
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:44,352
We were investigating them
until we had enough evidence!

56
00:10:47,978 --> 00:10:50,497
Thanks to you,
we don't have anything!

57
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:51,648
–What a pity.
–Mr Woo.

58
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:55,464
–What a pity.
–What is?

59
00:12:56,037 --> 00:12:58,158
That we didn't catch the triads.

60
00:13:00,455 --> 00:13:03,985
I remember you were
so sensitive in cadet school.

61
00:13:04,472 --> 00:13:05,731
Now you're so hard.

62
00:13:08,328 --> 00:13:09,767
Did I go too far?

63
00:13:11,703 --> 00:13:13,161
No, they went too far.

64
00:13:17,166 --> 00:13:18,730
I lost a good partner.

65
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,249
We have to make sacrifices.

66
00:14:56,905 --> 00:14:59,064
Long, I…

67
00:15:02,690 --> 00:15:05,301
Mr Hui wants to know
why you betrayed him.

68
00:15:05,341 --> 00:15:06,334
Long,

69
00:15:06,626 --> 00:15:08,715
I didn't betray Mr Hui.

70
00:15:08,750 --> 00:15:09,674
Yes, you did.

71
00:15:38,962 --> 00:15:40,951
Do you remember what happened?

72
00:15:41,413 --> 00:15:44,417
It happened so quickly.
It was like a dream.

73
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:49,718
What's going on?

74
00:15:49,768 --> 00:15:52,459
He's been dead two hours.
Close range shot.

75
00:15:52,499 --> 00:15:53,692
Very professional.

76
00:15:54,267 --> 00:15:56,520
–Have you found the gun?
–Not yet.

77
00:15:56,677 --> 00:15:59,460
I've seen the deceased
on the wanted list.

78
00:18:08,752 --> 00:18:10,476
I want it in half an hour.

79
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:13,651
The deceased
was a Malay Chinese terrorist.

80
00:18:14,015 --> 00:18:17,469
Arms dealing in Asia
and North Africa from 1978 to 1981.

81
00:18:17,509 --> 00:18:20,359
Wanted by
Malaysia, Thailand and Singapore.

82
00:18:20,361 --> 00:18:22,450
Joined the triads
in Hong Kong in 1985.

83
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:25,605
He was Mr Hui's
right hand man in arms dealing.

84
00:18:25,623 --> 00:18:27,347
Bought out by Johnny Wong.

85
00:18:27,431 --> 00:18:30,484
The murderer used a.32 Filipino gun.

86
00:18:30,519 --> 00:18:31,911
His style was unique.

87
00:18:32,251 --> 00:18:34,330
We have no further clues.

88
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:39,482
What? HK$3,000 per square foot
in Sha Tau Kok!

89
00:18:39,522 --> 00:18:41,007
I can't afford that!

90
00:18:43,378 --> 00:18:46,302
If I don't buy a flat,
Madam won't marry me!

91
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:51,992
I can't get government housing
because I'm unmarried.

92
00:18:52,657 --> 00:18:54,505
I'm going to be on the streets.

93
00:18:54,545 --> 00:18:55,824
Stay at the YMCA.

94
00:18:56,272 --> 00:18:58,723
HK$300 for one day
and discounts for a month.

95
00:18:58,763 --> 00:19:00,488
That's not bad!

96
00:19:00,852 --> 00:19:02,499
I'll sleep at the Jazz Bar.

97
00:19:02,539 --> 00:19:05,190
That's perfect.
You can play before bed.

98
00:19:06,315 --> 00:19:09,608
Shall we investigate
who's sending flowers to Madam?

99
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,101
–It's been happening a lot.
–So what?

100
00:19:22,704 --> 00:19:25,103
–Madam, flowers for you.
–Thank you.

101
00:19:52,951 --> 00:19:54,105
Master,

102
00:19:54,879 --> 00:19:56,478
please help me.

103
00:19:57,048 --> 00:20:00,495
Madam and I have had a few problems.
Please help me.

104
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,614
I'd appreciate a flat, too.

105
00:20:14,562 --> 00:20:17,806
Have you been sick?
You've had so many flowers.

106
00:20:17,976 --> 00:20:19,621
I'm sick alright.

107
00:20:20,226 --> 00:20:21,951
Don't lose hope,

108
00:20:22,515 --> 00:20:24,305
we might get back together.

109
00:20:24,684 --> 00:20:28,396
I don't think so. I was stupid
and I've wasted my youth.

110
00:20:28,942 --> 00:20:30,334
You like white roses?

111
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:33,682
–You didn't know?
–Have you told me?

112
00:20:33,722 --> 00:20:37,056
I haven't even told him!
How could he have known?

113
00:20:37,092 --> 00:20:37,936
The lyric.

114
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:45,572
He's asking if you're lonely
and if you need a man.

115
00:20:45,612 --> 00:20:47,932
I just want to know how to sing it.

116
00:21:12,485 --> 00:21:13,612
It's not “re re”.

117
00:21:14,695 --> 00:21:17,060
It's “la la ti le do”.

118
00:21:17,707 --> 00:21:19,467
–Is that all?
–Yes.

119
00:21:22,889 --> 00:21:25,048
Do you want some soup? No.

120
00:21:27,308 --> 00:21:28,462
Your underwear.

121
00:21:35,382 --> 00:21:37,436
Madam likes to get white roses.

122
00:21:37,471 --> 00:21:38,464
Really?

123
00:21:38,957 --> 00:21:40,190
I just found out.

124
00:21:40,443 --> 00:21:43,054
If you likes them,
you should buy her some.

125
00:21:43,094 --> 00:21:44,818
Let's see how she behaves.

126
00:21:46,348 --> 00:21:47,867
What song is this?

127
00:21:55,346 --> 00:21:57,071
I can sing if I what.

128
00:22:26,035 --> 00:22:27,189
What is it, boss?

129
00:22:28,927 --> 00:22:30,650
Any news on the arms case?

130
00:22:32,462 --> 00:22:35,067
Sorry, we don't have anything yet.

131
00:22:37,684 --> 00:22:38,564
Keep at it.

132
00:22:48,088 --> 00:22:48,967
Big Guy.

133
00:22:49,373 --> 00:22:50,898
<i>–Come here!
–OK.</i>

134
00:22:52,627 --> 00:22:53,826
Have some tea.

135
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,452
–What is it, Mr Hui?
–Eat.

136
00:22:57,487 --> 00:23:01,623
–We've eaten a lot already!
–You can't work if you don't eat!

137
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,039
Hi, Long!

138
00:23:07,449 --> 00:23:08,329
Mr Hui.

139
00:23:10,341 --> 00:23:11,335
Beef jerky.

140
00:23:14,278 --> 00:23:15,957
You did well.

141
00:23:17,050 --> 00:23:19,500
–So-so.
–I left the gun there, you know!

142
00:23:19,540 --> 00:23:20,420
Very clever.

143
00:23:20,745 --> 00:23:22,310
I told him to eat more!

144
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:26,522
Mr Hui treats us like children!

145
00:23:27,935 --> 00:23:29,740
I'm an old man…

146
00:23:30,185 --> 00:23:32,969
Loyalty is the most
important thing to me.

147
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,735
Is that right or wrong?

148
00:23:38,821 --> 00:23:41,075
We wouldn't respect you otherwise.

149
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:46,731
Long, if I did something wrong,

150
00:23:47,538 --> 00:23:49,062
how would you treat me?

151
00:23:50,711 --> 00:23:52,832
There are worse people than you.

152
00:23:53,885 --> 00:23:57,265
When you're free,
we'll go to Hawaii for a holiday.

153
00:23:57,901 --> 00:24:00,486
If you like it,
you can move out there.

154
00:24:00,834 --> 00:24:02,358
Leave Hong Kong behind.

155
00:24:04,248 --> 00:24:06,899
I do want to see out
my remaining years…

156
00:24:07,944 --> 00:24:11,508
but I still have
a lot of responsibilities here.

157
00:24:13,045 --> 00:24:13,973
I can't leave.

158
00:24:16,018 --> 00:24:18,139
I just want you to take it easy.

159
00:24:19,994 --> 00:24:21,399
–Siu!
–Morning.

160
00:24:22,485 --> 00:24:23,365
–Mr Hui.
–Hi.

161
00:24:23,730 --> 00:24:25,295
You're all dressed up.

162
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:28,950
Know who's on your side.
Be careful of him.

163
00:24:29,233 --> 00:24:31,925
Sorry I didn't bring
anything with me.

164
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:32,918
Don't worry.

165
00:24:33,933 --> 00:24:34,813
Long.

166
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:36,854
What is it?

167
00:24:38,070 --> 00:24:39,955
Johnny wants to talk to you.

168
00:24:49,679 --> 00:24:52,451
We don't have enough arms
for South America.

169
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,480
We'll get them somewhere else.

170
00:24:55,022 --> 00:24:56,907
No one's tougher than us.

171
00:24:58,155 --> 00:25:01,810
Don't do anything.
Let the restaurant incident die down.

172
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:02,977
This way, please.

173
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:06,099
Johnny, can we trust Long?

174
00:25:07,113 --> 00:25:08,306
It's worth a risk.

175
00:25:08,398 --> 00:25:11,182
We need to replace Sam
now that he's dead.

176
00:25:12,656 --> 00:25:14,495
Hi, Johnny. Sorry I'm late.

177
00:25:15,990 --> 00:25:17,909
–Johnny.
–This is Long.

178
00:25:18,199 --> 00:25:21,895
–You know each other already.
–We haven't had a chance to talk.

179
00:25:21,935 --> 00:25:22,995
I'm anti-social.

180
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,334
Have a seat.

181
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:28,957
I really admire you.

182
00:25:29,969 --> 00:25:32,156
–Are you happy with Mr Hui?
–Yes.

183
00:25:33,664 --> 00:25:35,719
You have to look to the future.

184
00:25:36,235 --> 00:25:38,224
You have the talent to go far.

185
00:25:40,493 --> 00:25:43,177
I make money wherever there's a war.

186
00:25:43,626 --> 00:25:47,317
Many things go out of fashion,
but not wars.

187
00:25:48,406 --> 00:25:50,461
You know how much money I make.

188
00:25:52,142 --> 00:25:54,130
We all know you're successful.

189
00:25:54,311 --> 00:25:55,703
Will you work for me?

190
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,085
I'm loyal to Mr Hui.

191
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:03,237
That's honourable.
That's what I like about you.

192
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:12,508
I paid a fortune
to get Jimmy to work for me.

193
00:26:12,548 --> 00:26:14,603
He organized a big deal for me.

194
00:26:16,324 --> 00:26:17,583
But you killed him!

195
00:26:22,992 --> 00:26:26,438
I can only admire your talent.
I won't take revenge.

196
00:26:29,780 --> 00:26:30,775
I respect that.

197
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:37,073
I came here to be your friend
but I'm not here to discuss business.

198
00:26:37,091 --> 00:26:39,809
Fine. You're honest.
I'll be your friend.

199
00:26:42,112 --> 00:26:45,824
–You got a lot of counterfeit goods.
–All thanks to you.

200
00:26:50,668 --> 00:26:52,633
Who did this?

201
00:26:52,918 --> 00:26:56,828
–Wait till I get that bastard!
–I'll kill his whole family!

202
00:27:01,996 --> 00:27:05,891
GANGSTERS AND POLICEMEN
DIE IN SHOOT-OUT

203
00:27:06,133 --> 00:27:09,378
TRIADS' ILLEGAL GUN TRADING—
SMUGGLERS SUSPECTED

204
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:17,530
Stop!

205
00:27:19,630 --> 00:27:20,510
You bastard!

206
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,318
Who do you think you are?

207
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,862
–What are you doing?
–Get lost!

208
00:27:27,262 --> 00:27:31,192
Your men killed my partner
at the Wuen Loi Restaurant.

209
00:27:31,922 --> 00:27:33,201
He was my friend.

210
00:27:34,011 --> 00:27:36,794
Your men also killed
many innocent people.

211
00:27:37,465 --> 00:27:38,619
I'm onto you.

212
00:27:40,398 --> 00:27:42,850
I'll arrest you one day, you bastard.

213
00:27:44,736 --> 00:27:45,809
Remember me.

214
00:27:48,793 --> 00:27:50,072
Hey.

215
00:27:50,601 --> 00:27:51,514
Remember me.

216
00:27:56,907 --> 00:27:58,630
This is not the best time.

217
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:01,717
Leave it.

218
00:28:40,089 --> 00:28:41,243
What a waste!

219
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:43,314
Was it not big enough?

220
00:28:44,106 --> 00:28:45,712
I'm waiting for a big one.

221
00:28:45,753 --> 00:28:48,271
You know your stuff.
That's expensive.

222
00:28:49,046 --> 00:28:51,125
–How much?
–HK$100,000.

223
00:28:51,657 --> 00:28:54,706
The police doesn't have much money.
HK$20,000.

224
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:58,044
I'm risking my life.
People are pointing guns at me.

225
00:28:58,084 --> 00:29:00,537
–That's not worth 100,000?
–Spare me.

226
00:29:00,776 --> 00:29:02,101
Take it or leave it.

227
00:29:03,989 --> 00:29:06,508
My mum told me
to stay away from cops.

228
00:29:07,805 --> 00:29:08,685
An address.

229
00:29:09,131 --> 00:29:11,781
Johnny is raiding
Hui's cache tonight.

230
00:29:13,108 --> 00:29:16,032
That bastard is ruthless. Be careful.

231
00:29:18,089 --> 00:29:21,601
Find me at the Jazz Bar
if you find Johnny's arsenal.

232
00:29:21,744 --> 00:29:22,624
OK.

233
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,932
I put your mum into the nursing home.

234
00:29:29,095 --> 00:29:30,088
Thank you.

235
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:31,334
Go and see her.

236
00:29:34,719 --> 00:29:37,237
I'll go
after I've achieved something.

237
00:29:40,101 --> 00:29:42,222
Hey, your money's in the bucket.

238
00:29:53,357 --> 00:29:55,213
Madam, more flowers for you.

239
00:30:18,021 --> 00:30:21,401
Call the armoury
and ask them to make preparations.

240
00:30:21,515 --> 00:30:24,609
–We need them for tonight.
–Shall we ask the boss?

241
00:30:24,649 --> 00:30:25,709
Say it's for me.

242
00:30:27,742 --> 00:30:29,741
Hello, armoury.

243
00:30:30,714 --> 00:30:33,165
My boss wants you
to prepare some guns.

244
00:30:33,205 --> 00:30:36,769
We'll come down later.
Don't ask so many questions.

245
00:30:56,583 --> 00:31:00,162
–Shall we call more people to help?
–No, it's alright.

246
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,046
You two, go outside.

247
00:31:06,505 --> 00:31:09,558
Someone's stolen an officer's gun.
This is your case.

248
00:31:09,598 --> 00:31:11,984
Don't worry about the arms case, OK?

249
00:31:14,579 --> 00:31:19,218
I've been working on it for so long
and you're telling me to leave it?

250
00:31:20,644 --> 00:31:22,434
Can't you listen just once?

251
00:31:23,577 --> 00:31:25,096
Do you have to shout?

252
00:31:27,674 --> 00:31:28,873
Enjoying the show?

253
00:31:30,687 --> 00:31:32,735
This is my office.
Can't you respect me?

254
00:31:32,775 --> 00:31:35,700
So what?
The whole station is mine! Listen…

255
00:31:41,894 --> 00:31:43,862
Do you have to get so worked up?

256
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:46,686
If you need a shit,
just go to the toilet!

257
00:32:10,574 --> 00:32:12,893
Hello? Wait a minute. It's Long.

258
00:32:14,069 --> 00:32:14,949
Hello?

259
00:32:15,234 --> 00:32:17,355
<i>I need your help tonight.</i>

260
00:32:18,166 --> 00:32:19,974
<i>You won't regret coming.</i>

261
00:32:20,014 --> 00:32:21,819
<i>OK. I'll come.</i>

262
00:32:22,866 --> 00:32:24,987
I'll get someone to pick you up.

263
00:33:31,234 --> 00:33:32,227
Hurry up.

264
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:55,697
–Are we raiding my boss' cache?
–Yes, and I want you to kill him.

265
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:59,448
I won't force you.
I want to know if we can be partners.

266
00:34:02,325 --> 00:34:04,004
I've always admired you.

267
00:34:07,185 --> 00:34:10,433
Either we're in this together
or you can kill me.

268
00:34:11,604 --> 00:34:12,483
No regrets.

269
00:34:13,773 --> 00:34:14,701
I have my own.

270
00:35:04,787 --> 00:35:05,667
It's a raid!

271
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:45,849
Run!

272
00:37:14,252 --> 00:37:16,091
Come here!

273
00:37:16,220 --> 00:37:17,579
Get the guns!

274
00:37:18,751 --> 00:37:19,824
Hurry!

275
00:37:35,542 --> 00:37:36,741
Load up the car!

276
00:37:37,671 --> 00:37:38,550
Hurry!

277
00:37:45,905 --> 00:37:46,432
Long,

278
00:37:46,468 --> 00:37:49,073
I've done my part,
it's your turn now.

279
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:54,092
You've already ruined him.
Let the old man go.

280
00:37:54,622 --> 00:37:56,743
Do you think he would let me go?

281
00:37:57,353 --> 00:37:58,233
No.

282
00:37:59,482 --> 00:38:02,214
In this world,
the one with the gun always wins.

283
00:38:02,254 --> 00:38:05,568
The old bastard is in the way.
I have to kill him.

284
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,239
He might not
want to make money, but I do.

285
00:38:08,279 --> 00:38:10,730
His low prices
are pushing down the market.

286
00:38:10,770 --> 00:38:12,049
Don't blame me.

287
00:38:13,702 --> 00:38:16,950
People admire success,
not how you made it there.

288
00:38:28,364 --> 00:38:29,437
Load it up.

289
00:38:37,723 --> 00:38:39,322
It all depends on you.

290
00:38:43,508 --> 00:38:46,159
When Mr Hui gets here,
if you can't do it,

291
00:38:46,199 --> 00:38:47,478
I'll do it.

292
00:38:51,863 --> 00:38:53,188
You know what to do.

293
00:38:58,250 --> 00:38:59,403
Let's go!

294
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,557
Don't move!

295
00:40:33,892 --> 00:40:35,457
Don't come any closer!

296
00:40:44,175 --> 00:40:45,368
Long, you traitor!

297
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:47,740
How dare you? I'll kill you!

298
00:40:48,112 --> 00:40:49,040
Drop your gun!

299
00:40:50,803 --> 00:40:52,608
Drop it!

300
00:41:01,408 --> 00:41:02,402
Drop your guns.

301
00:41:04,099 --> 00:41:05,013
Drop them.

302
00:41:07,232 --> 00:41:08,226
Drop your guns!

303
00:41:13,258 --> 00:41:14,137
Long…

304
00:41:14,905 --> 00:41:16,495
I know I'll die tonight.

305
00:41:28,321 --> 00:41:29,235
Mr Hui.

306
00:41:29,807 --> 00:41:33,917
You've dropped your guns.
Are you giving up or are you scared?

307
00:41:34,387 --> 00:41:35,586
Drop them.

308
00:41:37,319 --> 00:41:39,604
Drop them!

309
00:41:40,131 --> 00:41:41,969
Drop your guns! Drop them!

310
00:41:47,241 --> 00:41:48,474
Johnny,

311
00:41:48,727 --> 00:41:50,516
it doesn't matter if I die,

312
00:41:50,655 --> 00:41:52,445
but will you let my men go?

313
00:41:54,110 --> 00:41:57,914
–Do you want them all to die?
–It's not up to me.

314
00:41:59,372 --> 00:42:01,161
You do what you want to do.

315
00:42:03,429 --> 00:42:05,668
Johnny, you're smart.

316
00:42:06,562 --> 00:42:08,088
I need to speak to Long.

317
00:42:08,129 --> 00:42:09,122
Is that OK?

318
00:42:10,418 --> 00:42:12,141
What's the use of talking?

319
00:42:22,951 --> 00:42:23,831
Long…

320
00:42:24,196 --> 00:42:25,429
life is like this.

321
00:42:28,896 --> 00:42:32,506
Sometimes you have to do things
you don't want to do.

322
00:42:37,171 --> 00:42:39,292
Like I want to quit but I can't.

323
00:42:40,505 --> 00:42:43,076
I knew this day
would come in this business.

324
00:42:43,116 --> 00:42:45,435
I didn't think you would betray me.

325
00:42:45,968 --> 00:42:49,679
I trusted the wrong person.
There's nothing left to say.

326
00:42:50,426 --> 00:42:52,614
I beg you, please let the men go.

327
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,686
I'm happy to die.

328
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:59,428
It's better than dying
at the hands of those bastards.

329
00:43:00,469 --> 00:43:02,114
Long, do as I say.

330
00:43:02,678 --> 00:43:04,323
–Mr Hui.
–Shoot.

331
00:43:09,788 --> 00:43:10,668
Shoot!

332
00:43:10,953 --> 00:43:11,833
Just do it!

333
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:15,810
If you don't kill me, I'll kill you!

334
00:43:19,670 --> 00:43:21,268
–Mr Hui!
–Don't move!

335
00:43:21,517 --> 00:43:23,356
–Mr Hui!
–Don't move!

336
00:43:29,872 --> 00:43:33,162
Mr Hui! Mr Hui!

337
00:44:48,082 --> 00:44:49,805
–Boss…
–Kill that bastard!

338
00:45:16,360 --> 00:45:17,114
Kill him!

339
00:45:17,284 --> 00:45:18,358
You go, boss.

340
00:45:20,377 --> 00:45:22,982
–Let me kill him!
–It's not worth it.

341
00:45:26,363 --> 00:45:27,489
–Be careful.
–OK.

342
00:50:20,480 --> 00:50:22,045
Who is he?

343
00:50:23,814 --> 00:50:25,670
How come he didn't shoot me?

344
00:50:25,903 --> 00:50:28,289
I told you to leave this case alone.

345
00:50:28,474 --> 00:50:29,913
Tell me who he is!

346
00:50:32,129 --> 00:50:33,786
–A criminal.
–A criminal.

347
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:36,539
You say he's a criminal,

348
00:50:36,588 --> 00:50:38,112
I hope he's a criminal.

349
00:50:39,520 --> 00:50:42,091
Next time I bump into him,

350
00:50:42,292 --> 00:50:43,571
I won't hold back.

351
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:46,397
Hold on. Stay where you are!

352
00:50:50,044 --> 00:50:54,294
Legally, I'm not obliged
to tell you anything.

353
00:50:54,624 --> 00:50:56,712
But I have to tell you something.

354
00:50:56,753 --> 00:51:00,597
If I hadn't run out of bullets,
I would have killed a cop.

355
00:51:00,689 --> 00:51:02,288
You're overreacting.

356
00:51:03,662 --> 00:51:05,186
Back at the restaurant…

357
00:51:06,273 --> 00:51:07,277
you did kill a cop.

358
00:51:07,317 --> 00:51:08,471
Yes, I did.

359
00:51:08,723 --> 00:51:11,043
Cops have killed other cops before.

360
00:51:11,575 --> 00:51:12,614
You're wrong.

361
00:51:12,901 --> 00:51:16,556
You should have said, he wasn't
the first cop to sacrifice his life.

362
00:51:16,596 --> 00:51:17,750
Sacrifice?

363
00:51:17,922 --> 00:51:19,579
Is that what you call it?

364
00:51:20,854 --> 00:51:24,148
You better tell me who the cops are
and who the triads are…

365
00:51:24,188 --> 00:51:26,176
and why you want us both dead?

366
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,609
Why do you have so many questions?

367
00:51:30,655 --> 00:51:31,785
You're a cop.

368
00:51:31,820 --> 00:51:34,869
Your job is to obey orders,
not question them!

369
00:51:35,074 --> 00:51:36,466
You want to know why?

370
00:51:37,082 --> 00:51:38,739
You can't always ask why.

371
00:51:39,774 --> 00:51:42,955
Why do we need search warrants
and triads don't?

372
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:47,807
Why do we have to write reports when
we use a gun and the triads don't?

373
00:51:47,848 --> 00:51:50,830
Why are suspects innocent
until proven guilty

374
00:51:50,860 --> 00:51:54,355
and why does the burden of proof
lie on us, not on them?

375
00:51:54,395 --> 00:51:55,834
Why?

376
00:51:56,082 --> 00:51:58,251
If I knew that, I'd be in your place.

377
00:51:58,292 --> 00:51:59,525
Alright?

378
00:52:00,782 --> 00:52:03,101
I'll say this.

379
00:52:03,232 --> 00:52:05,964
I lost my friend, Lung,
at the restaurant.

380
00:52:06,004 --> 00:52:08,053
I don't care whether I die or not…

381
00:52:08,093 --> 00:52:11,009
but I swear I'll arrest
that bastard Johnny.

382
00:52:11,949 --> 00:52:14,640
God help anybody
that tries to stop me.

383
00:52:14,676 --> 00:52:15,520
Stop!

384
00:52:21,027 --> 00:52:24,591
If something bad happens
because of you…

385
00:52:25,968 --> 00:52:28,288
it won't be enough for you to quit.

386
00:52:28,780 --> 00:52:30,013
I'm shaking!

387
00:52:31,632 --> 00:52:34,685
That's a cop's life for you.
You're never good enough.

388
00:52:34,725 --> 00:52:37,537
I asked myself
if I should do the right thing.

389
00:52:37,577 --> 00:52:41,421
But every time I read the newspaper,
I felt uncomfortable.

390
00:52:41,594 --> 00:52:43,582
I felt I had a responsibility.

391
00:52:44,606 --> 00:52:47,228
After the job,
I forgot about being shouted at.

392
00:52:47,269 --> 00:52:50,069
–And if you didn't solve a case?
–I was suicidal.

393
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,708
–That bad?
–Yes.

394
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:56,255
You should have given me a better
drawing. It turns out I know him.

395
00:52:56,296 --> 00:52:57,983
He lives at Clearwater Bay.

396
00:52:58,023 --> 00:53:00,148
How can I thank you?

397
00:53:00,835 --> 00:53:02,227
With better drawings.

398
00:53:05,253 --> 00:53:06,006
So?

399
00:53:06,338 --> 00:53:10,513
If Superintendent Pang says he's
a triad, then he's undercover.

400
00:53:11,198 --> 00:53:13,037
If you speak to him,

401
00:53:13,367 --> 00:53:17,218
tell him there's no need
to get killed to solve a case.

402
00:53:23,008 --> 00:53:27,304
–Have you got a cop called Vodka?
–He's called Tequila.

403
00:53:27,427 --> 00:53:28,946
He's a tough cop.

404
00:53:30,439 --> 00:53:33,422
I don't care who he is.
Tell him to back off.

405
00:53:33,532 --> 00:53:36,182
He'll ruin everything.

406
00:53:36,465 --> 00:53:38,917
Do you want to go to another funeral?

407
00:53:39,076 --> 00:53:40,229
Don't worry,

408
00:53:40,682 --> 00:53:41,836
I'll stop him.

409
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:44,707
And get that export license.

410
00:53:44,860 --> 00:53:47,776
I need that shipment
to find Johnny's cache.

411
00:53:49,439 --> 00:53:50,632
Give me a day, OK?

412
00:53:50,966 --> 00:53:52,804
I'll deal with customs.

413
00:53:53,215 --> 00:53:55,706
–Wait for my call.
–And my Swiss bank account?

414
00:53:55,746 --> 00:53:56,625
It's sorted.

415
00:53:56,830 --> 00:53:58,638
What about the house in Guam?

416
00:53:58,678 --> 00:54:00,438
Does it have a garden?

417
00:54:00,486 --> 00:54:02,010
Don't bother with that.

418
00:54:02,092 --> 00:54:04,479
If it's too dangerous, you can quit.

419
00:54:04,944 --> 00:54:08,029
I'll hold you to that.

420
00:54:11,572 --> 00:54:13,296
I knew you'd be like this.

421
00:54:14,103 --> 00:54:16,224
You know I always do a good job.

422
00:54:19,365 --> 00:54:22,083
It's your birthday today.
Did you forget?

423
00:54:24,105 --> 00:54:24,985
It's for you.

424
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:28,760
I had forgotten.

425
00:54:29,729 --> 00:54:33,904
Birthdays aren't important
when you don't have a real identity.

426
00:54:34,670 --> 00:54:36,923
Only you know when my birthday is.

427
00:54:39,932 --> 00:54:41,496
Don't you forget it.

428
00:55:29,299 --> 00:55:32,812
What? You're still upset
and you want to get revenge?

429
00:55:46,130 --> 00:55:49,046
What are you?
It's hard to call you a triad.

430
00:55:49,545 --> 00:55:51,864
It's even harder to call you a cop.

431
00:55:52,156 --> 00:55:53,595
What rank are you?

432
00:55:54,043 --> 00:55:55,448
Sergeant?

433
00:55:55,771 --> 00:55:57,095
Inspector? Joker?

434
00:55:58,342 --> 00:55:59,667
Should I salute you?

435
00:56:00,149 --> 00:56:01,348
If you like.

436
00:56:01,515 --> 00:56:03,039
To you, I'm a criminal.

437
00:56:03,523 --> 00:56:04,915
To my mum, I'm a son.

438
00:56:05,090 --> 00:56:06,813
To the triads, I'm a boss.

439
00:56:10,031 --> 00:56:13,001
–Should I salute you?
–You've got the gun.

440
00:56:13,726 --> 00:56:16,046
I'll go and milk a cow if you want.

441
00:56:16,659 --> 00:56:18,658
Sorry, I don't drink milk.

442
00:56:24,853 --> 00:56:27,305
Why do you have so many paper cranes?

443
00:56:28,026 --> 00:56:30,026
Are you lonely?

444
00:56:30,597 --> 00:56:32,916
Do they keep you company?

445
00:56:36,141 --> 00:56:38,129
I've always hated making them.

446
00:56:40,117 --> 00:56:42,503
I make one each time I kill someone.

447
00:56:43,933 --> 00:56:45,060
Do you like them?

448
00:56:45,259 --> 00:56:46,384
I'll make you one.

449
00:56:46,424 --> 00:56:47,497
Thank you.

450
00:56:51,325 --> 00:56:53,512
Who will make yours when you die?

451
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:57,864
Let's team up

452
00:56:58,113 --> 00:57:00,035
and make one for Johnny Wong.

453
00:57:01,447 --> 00:57:02,692
You make it yourself.

454
00:57:02,733 --> 00:57:03,966
I don't have time.

455
00:57:04,661 --> 00:57:05,986
I'm meeting someone.

456
00:57:09,762 --> 00:57:11,817
I hate going to cops' funerals.

457
00:57:14,181 --> 00:57:16,036
Every time a colleague dies…

458
00:57:17,796 --> 00:57:19,320
I play a song for them.

459
00:57:19,603 --> 00:57:22,520
I don't want to have
to play a song for you.

460
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:56,081
Go! Johnny Wong's coming!

461
00:58:57,495 --> 00:59:00,147
–How do I get in touch?
–I'll send you a crane.

462
00:59:00,187 --> 00:59:02,186
Take care, mate.

463
00:59:05,810 --> 00:59:07,044
You traitor.

464
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:08,450
And that cop…

465
00:59:09,787 --> 00:59:11,706
Check the place.

466
00:59:13,603 --> 00:59:15,525
I've been after this bastard!

467
00:59:17,901 --> 00:59:22,011
I'll keep an eye out for you.
No one will dare to make a move.

468
00:59:23,645 --> 00:59:25,037
Take him to hospital!

469
00:59:31,920 --> 00:59:35,214
<i>This is my hospital.
You'll get 24 hour protection.</i>

470
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:39,231
<i>–I'll be alright.
–Don't worry. It's best to be safe.</i>

471
00:59:42,444 --> 00:59:43,324
Thank you.

472
00:59:47,988 --> 00:59:50,147
Nurse! Nurse! Nurse!

473
00:59:50,478 --> 00:59:53,129
–When did he get hurt?
–At the building site.

474
00:59:53,170 --> 00:59:54,849
Can you get a doctor?

475
00:59:55,419 --> 00:59:58,184
They'll take care of you first.

476
01:00:27,112 --> 01:00:29,167
–Is it our turn yet?
–Sit down!

477
01:00:29,362 --> 01:00:30,886
It's not your turn yet!

478
01:00:32,294 --> 01:00:35,608
–This is a deep wound.
–Nurse, can I speak to you?

479
01:00:38,561 --> 01:00:40,288
I don't want any record of this.

480
01:00:40,328 --> 01:00:42,847
I don't want
anyone to know he's here.

481
01:00:44,184 --> 01:00:45,775
<i>Siu betrayed you.</i>

482
01:00:46,434 --> 01:00:48,563
He gave your address to Hui's men.

483
01:00:48,603 --> 01:00:50,088
I'll deal with him.

484
01:00:50,732 --> 01:00:53,102
–I can handle it.
–Wait until you're better.

485
01:00:53,142 --> 01:00:55,106
I'll sort him out.

486
01:01:16,400 --> 01:01:17,990
Are you sure it was Siu?

487
01:01:18,248 --> 01:01:21,698
He's been working for the cops
while working for me.

488
01:01:22,345 --> 01:01:24,532
He told me where Hui's cache was.

489
01:01:28,129 --> 01:01:29,122
Bastard!

490
01:01:32,628 --> 01:01:35,199
He must know
where your firearms are.

491
01:01:37,930 --> 01:01:39,985
How could you tell him so much?

492
01:01:40,823 --> 01:01:43,341
I have to kill
that two-faced bastard!

493
01:01:48,495 --> 01:01:49,375
Let me do it.

494
01:02:21,514 --> 01:02:23,635
How much have you told the cops?

495
01:02:26,535 --> 01:02:30,379
There's no point killing me,
I haven't told them anything.

496
01:02:34,609 --> 01:02:35,888
You bastard!

497
01:02:36,296 --> 01:02:37,176
Stop lying!

498
01:02:39,148 --> 01:02:41,913
How come they knew about the raid?

499
01:02:46,619 --> 01:02:47,499
Why me?

500
01:02:48,909 --> 01:02:51,600
It's all about money these days,
not loyalty.

501
01:02:51,641 --> 01:02:52,834
Who can you trust?

502
01:03:01,763 --> 01:03:03,852
<i>Mr Woo, I have a good friend.</i>

503
01:03:03,892 --> 01:03:06,222
It's doesn't matter
if he's good or bad.

504
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:08,449
We're both in serious danger now.

505
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:11,153
If you were me, would you save him?

506
01:03:11,203 --> 01:03:14,450
If he was my friend,
I would definitely save him,

507
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:16,113
whether he's good or bad.

508
01:03:16,385 --> 01:03:19,629
If I was a cop,
I would still save him.

509
01:03:20,843 --> 01:03:24,157
–Then you're a martyr.
–Not me. It's Him up there.

510
01:03:28,154 --> 01:03:29,753
Siu! Siu!

511
01:03:31,006 --> 01:03:34,697
–What happened?
–Are you OK?

512
01:03:35,826 --> 01:03:38,345
–Johnny's arsenal is at…
–Where is it?

513
01:03:38,879 --> 01:03:42,489
–It's at the Maple Hospital.
–Maple?

514
01:03:44,222 --> 01:03:45,101
Siu!

515
01:03:45,266 --> 01:03:48,779
Can you ask my girlfriend
to meet me at the hospital?

516
01:04:25,033 --> 01:04:26,293
Who brought him in?

517
01:04:26,399 --> 01:04:27,526
I brought him in.

518
01:04:28,287 --> 01:04:32,662
I'm Inspector Yuen, CID. I'll
register him later. I'm responsible.

519
01:04:51,224 --> 01:04:52,103
Hold on.

520
01:04:55,763 --> 01:04:56,756
Sorry.

521
01:05:01,467 --> 01:05:03,588
–How's his blood pressure?
–Low.

522
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:05,158
80/50.

523
01:05:05,805 --> 01:05:07,130
And his pupils?

524
01:05:11,469 --> 01:05:13,228
Somewhat dilated.

525
01:05:13,999 --> 01:05:15,446
Nurse, give him some oxygen.

526
01:05:15,486 --> 01:05:18,257
<i>Boss, that cop took Siu to hospital.</i>

527
01:05:18,298 --> 01:05:19,862
What's happened?

528
01:05:20,627 --> 01:05:23,680
Siu's still alive.
That cop took him to hospital.

529
01:05:23,720 --> 01:05:24,913
He'll grass us up.

530
01:05:26,050 --> 01:05:27,707
–I'll sort him out.
–You?

531
01:05:28,139 --> 01:05:30,348
Don't worry, I'll kill him this time.

532
01:05:30,388 --> 01:05:31,648
Kill that cop, too.

533
01:05:42,760 --> 01:05:44,417
<i>I'm not convinced.</i>

534
01:05:45,251 --> 01:05:46,510
Send some extra men

535
01:05:46,577 --> 01:05:47,490
to help him.

536
01:05:50,433 --> 01:05:53,680
This patient is my witness.
How is his condition?

537
01:05:53,807 --> 01:05:56,338
Luckily,
the lighter stopped the bullet.

538
01:05:56,378 --> 01:05:58,499
–Can he talk?
–He needs to rest.

539
01:06:44,822 --> 01:06:46,147
How are you feeling?

540
01:06:47,633 --> 01:06:49,359
–Cig…
–What?

541
01:06:49,521 --> 01:06:50,675
Cigarette.

542
01:06:51,610 --> 01:06:53,735
The oxygen might explode.

543
01:06:55,707 --> 01:06:57,592
Turn it off. Turn it off.

544
01:06:58,720 --> 01:07:00,642
You're half dead and smoking?

545
01:07:00,809 --> 01:07:02,248
I'm screwed.

546
01:07:02,978 --> 01:07:06,508
I want to prove
I was one of the best before I die.

547
01:07:08,079 --> 01:07:09,964
You've proved it already.

548
01:07:15,511 --> 01:07:17,109
You've done it.

549
01:07:19,849 --> 01:07:23,906
<i>I found that Johnny's arsenal
is in this hospital's basement.</i>

550
01:07:23,946 --> 01:07:25,751
Wasn't I smart this time?

551
01:07:30,172 --> 01:07:33,288
If I solve this case,
I'll pay you the old fee.

552
01:07:34,350 --> 01:07:36,007
I won't live to spend it.

553
01:07:42,223 --> 01:07:44,675
It's up to you to put on a good show.

554
01:07:46,883 --> 01:07:48,587
Come on now.

555
01:07:48,622 --> 01:07:50,291
Don't smoke.

556
01:07:53,952 --> 01:07:55,186
Get some rest.

557
01:07:55,961 --> 01:07:57,618
–Who's been smoking?
–Me.

558
01:07:58,050 --> 01:08:00,049
It's dangerous.

559
01:08:00,580 --> 01:08:02,187
–That's why I put it out.
–Don't do it again.

560
01:08:02,227 --> 01:08:03,872
Time for your injection.

561
01:08:05,682 --> 01:08:09,611
Hey, don't let her inject me.
They might try to kill me.

562
01:08:09,940 --> 01:08:12,392
Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on you.

563
01:08:13,515 --> 01:08:15,437
The man outside gave me this.

564
01:08:27,172 --> 01:08:30,022
–Where are you taking me?
–To a safe place.

565
01:08:34,121 --> 01:08:36,166
I have a colleague here.

566
01:08:36,451 --> 01:08:38,572
–Which room is he in?
–Room 301.

567
01:09:34,375 --> 01:09:36,665
White roses again.
Was there nothing else?

568
01:09:36,705 --> 01:09:37,984
What's the problem?

569
01:09:39,798 --> 01:09:41,565
You're a bad undercover cop.

570
01:09:41,605 --> 01:09:43,444
It's a matter of taste.

571
01:09:45,542 --> 01:09:49,386
White roses every time.
Even my mum knows what's going on.

572
01:09:49,559 --> 01:09:50,439
Where's Siu?

573
01:09:50,684 --> 01:09:51,403
Next door.

574
01:09:52,009 --> 01:09:55,124
–Do you know where the firearms are?
–I forgot!

575
01:09:57,553 --> 01:09:59,276
I don't have time to joke.

576
01:10:00,605 --> 01:10:02,170
Neither do I.

577
01:10:09,402 --> 01:10:11,081
Where are the firearms?

578
01:10:18,641 --> 01:10:22,979
I let Siu go so he could find you.
I've worked hard these five years.

579
01:10:23,020 --> 01:10:24,699
The police are after me.

580
01:10:25,470 --> 01:10:28,187
I'm always worried
about getting exposed.

581
01:10:28,724 --> 01:10:29,983
I'm forced to kill.

582
01:10:30,812 --> 01:10:34,524
I don't care about dying,
I just want to solve the case.

583
01:10:34,709 --> 01:10:35,874
And you're joking with me?

584
01:10:35,914 --> 01:10:37,571
I don't know how to joke.

585
01:10:45,715 --> 01:10:48,366
So what
if you manage to solve the case?

586
01:10:49,652 --> 01:10:52,624
The police will give you money
and a passport,

587
01:10:52,664 --> 01:10:54,263
but where will you go?

588
01:10:54,753 --> 01:10:55,958
Where are you going?

589
01:10:55,998 --> 01:10:57,589
You've got an operation.

590
01:11:05,639 --> 01:11:07,078
If you die,

591
01:11:07,728 --> 01:11:10,114
they won't give you a grand funeral.

592
01:11:16,003 --> 01:11:17,236
I know that.

593
01:11:17,931 --> 01:11:19,769
That's fine, then. Come on.

594
01:11:58,220 --> 01:11:59,907
–What's going on?
–Nothing.

595
01:11:59,947 --> 01:12:01,021
Walk that way.

596
01:12:08,785 --> 01:12:11,237
–Look out for anyone suspicious.
–OK.

597
01:12:16,618 --> 01:12:17,897
Be careful.

598
01:12:24,330 --> 01:12:27,095
Let's go back up.
My colleague is coming.

599
01:12:57,911 --> 01:13:00,231
–Tequila!
–Have you been here long?

600
01:13:00,321 --> 01:13:01,515
Let's talk inside.

601
01:13:02,330 --> 01:13:03,722
Do you have any news?

602
01:13:04,338 --> 01:13:06,724
The morgue has steel reinforcements.

603
01:13:07,030 --> 01:13:10,079
<i>It took almost four months
to build it.</i>

604
01:13:12,252 --> 01:13:15,102
–Siu said that before he died.
–Siu's dead?

605
01:13:17,313 --> 01:13:18,307
I was too late.

606
01:13:21,571 --> 01:13:23,294
I forgot to introduce you.

607
01:13:23,298 --> 01:13:25,387
She's my girlfriend, Teresa Chang.

608
01:13:25,427 --> 01:13:27,747
You've been sending flowers to her.

609
01:13:31,452 --> 01:13:33,905
–The flowers were lovely.
–Thank you.

610
01:13:35,228 --> 01:13:36,753
I picked them randomly.

611
01:13:39,085 --> 01:13:42,001
–She doesn't like them.
–I want to get more.

612
01:13:42,338 --> 01:13:44,748
–Are you not getting on?
–Not really.

613
01:13:44,789 --> 01:13:48,433
Couples argue all the time.
We'll be alright.

614
01:13:50,452 --> 01:13:54,694
Call the Superintendent. Ask him
to come here. Wait for me here.

615
01:13:55,996 --> 01:13:58,366
–How will we signal her?
–With flowers.

616
01:13:58,406 --> 01:13:59,891
–Flowers?
–Yes.

617
01:14:00,173 --> 01:14:01,565
You, send me flowers?

618
01:14:02,383 --> 01:14:03,662
I taught him.

619
01:14:04,672 --> 01:14:06,031
I just picked it up.

620
01:14:06,199 --> 01:14:07,078
Thank you.

621
01:14:10,818 --> 01:14:12,740
I'll send them in 30 minutes.

622
01:14:14,032 --> 01:14:16,482
You're smart enough
to know what to do.

623
01:14:16,522 --> 01:14:18,201
Shall we go?

624
01:14:27,609 --> 01:14:28,488
B2.

625
01:14:29,818 --> 01:14:32,933
Superintendent,
can you come to Maple hospital?

626
01:14:35,602 --> 01:14:37,041
–Are you new?
–Yes.

627
01:14:37,731 --> 01:14:39,659
–What's your name?
–Ng Yue Lum.

628
01:14:39,700 --> 01:14:42,815
–I'd like to see a doctor.
–What's the problem?

629
01:14:42,913 --> 01:14:43,793
Fever.

630
01:14:46,729 --> 01:14:48,408
Who have you got there?

631
01:14:48,738 --> 01:14:52,383
Don't look, he died horribly
with his guts hanging out.

632
01:14:52,795 --> 01:14:54,119
Massive bleeding.

633
01:15:09,786 --> 01:15:15,122
–Wasn't my timing perfect?
–Not bad. Theirs was better.

634
01:15:23,765 --> 01:15:25,687
Teresa Chang, it's your turn.

635
01:15:26,778 --> 01:15:28,700
Let another patient go first.

636
01:15:31,477 --> 01:15:33,598
It's OK, I'm feeling better now.

637
01:15:36,619 --> 01:15:39,704
–You should see a doctor.
–I don't want to!

638
01:15:40,716 --> 01:15:43,036
Stay calm. Don't forget we're cops.

639
01:15:51,080 --> 01:15:52,538
<i>Where are they?</i>

640
01:15:53,771 --> 01:15:54,970
In the morgue.

641
01:16:07,589 --> 01:16:09,589
Look, these four are empty.

642
01:16:10,923 --> 01:16:12,728
J 1, 2, 3, 4.

643
01:16:42,255 --> 01:16:45,437
Are you crazy?
How are we going to get back out?

644
01:16:46,232 --> 01:16:48,419
I've got no intention of leaving.

645
01:16:49,566 --> 01:16:52,250
How's Long? Has his cover been blown?

646
01:16:53,262 --> 01:16:55,066
Everything depends on him.

647
01:16:55,591 --> 01:17:00,496
<i>I hope it's not too dangerous in
the morgue. May God keep him safe.</i>

648
01:17:00,733 --> 01:17:04,107
Tequila's there too.
You haven't even mentioned him!

649
01:17:04,147 --> 01:17:06,112
<i>He's in danger tool</i>

650
01:17:06,919 --> 01:17:10,299
You're so biased!
You're always having a go at him.

651
01:17:10,374 --> 01:17:13,025
You don't understand
nor care about him.

652
01:17:15,997 --> 01:17:18,648
<i>I didn't realize you still cared.</i>

653
01:17:23,388 --> 01:17:26,473
Really.

654
01:17:27,044 --> 01:17:29,534
–What did he say?
–He said to wait for his signal.

655
01:17:29,574 --> 01:17:32,822
When I get the flowers,
we evacuate the patients.

656
01:18:05,686 --> 01:18:08,851
How come
you can't even open a door?

657
01:18:10,466 --> 01:18:12,256
Why don't you try? Open it.

658
01:18:15,568 --> 01:18:19,279
What are you complaining about then?
You're not helping!

659
01:18:19,826 --> 01:18:21,615
This is not even your case!

660
01:18:24,606 --> 01:18:28,216
It's not my case?

661
01:18:28,703 --> 01:18:32,415
I got this far. I think
it has everything to do with me.

662
01:18:32,600 --> 01:18:34,809
If all cops were as selfish as you,

663
01:18:34,849 --> 01:18:36,440
Hong Kong would be dead.

664
01:18:38,906 --> 01:18:40,497
Don't take it out on me.

665
01:18:41,557 --> 01:18:42,949
Let me open the door.

666
01:20:02,859 --> 01:20:06,173
Which year did you graduate?
Who was your teacher?

667
01:20:07,639 --> 01:20:09,204
Are you testing me?

668
01:20:10,210 --> 01:20:12,529
I'd just like to ask your teacher

669
01:20:13,584 --> 01:20:16,633
how he managed to produce
such a stubborn cop.

670
01:20:19,208 --> 01:20:21,462
Pang said you don't waste bullets.

671
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:23,825
Are you testing me?

672
01:22:09,352 --> 01:22:10,279
What the hell!

673
01:24:05,922 --> 01:24:08,453
We killed Siu
but Long and that cop have gone.

674
01:24:08,493 --> 01:24:09,978
Call all units now.

675
01:24:10,180 --> 01:24:11,253
Sir…

676
01:24:11,505 --> 01:24:12,964
Evacuate the patients!

677
01:24:14,157 --> 01:24:16,042
I found it in my pocket.

678
01:24:16,366 --> 01:24:17,246
Get the team.

679
01:24:55,732 --> 01:24:58,979
They're in the basement.
Sorry, it was our fault.

680
01:25:29,554 --> 01:25:32,072
There are
two groups of people I hate…

681
01:25:33,169 --> 01:25:36,174
cops and those
who kill their bosses.

682
01:25:39,676 --> 01:25:40,556
You bastard.

683
01:25:41,605 --> 01:25:43,527
If your information is wrong,

684
01:25:43,774 --> 01:25:46,505
it'll cause panic
and patients could be hurt.

685
01:25:46,545 --> 01:25:48,112
–Who's responsible?
–I am.

686
01:25:48,152 --> 01:25:51,797
I'm in charge here.
The patients are my responsibility.

687
01:25:52,450 --> 01:25:55,698
I won't evacuate
unless there's a serious threat.

688
01:26:08,116 --> 01:26:09,475
What's going on?

689
01:26:10,245 --> 01:26:11,810
Calm down!

690
01:26:12,374 --> 01:26:13,766
Return to your rooms!

691
01:26:14,543 --> 01:26:18,454
Doctor, don't you have to evacuate
if there's a fire alarm?

692
01:26:33,623 --> 01:26:35,148
You said it was secure!

693
01:26:36,636 --> 01:26:38,359
–Turn the coolant on.
–OK.

694
01:27:19,938 --> 01:27:21,698
We can't fail now.

695
01:27:23,594 --> 01:27:24,793
We have no choice.

696
01:27:24,879 --> 01:27:27,651
We don't have much time.
We have to move them.

697
01:27:27,691 --> 01:27:29,130
That bastard.

698
01:27:31,386 --> 01:27:34,471
It's all up to me.
No one can challenge me.

699
01:27:34,801 --> 01:27:36,789
–What?
–Evacuate the patients!

700
01:27:37,894 --> 01:27:39,698
Over there!

701
01:27:39,902 --> 01:27:41,027
It's just a drill.

702
01:27:41,067 --> 01:27:42,592
It's just a fire drill.

703
01:27:43,517 --> 01:27:45,836
It's OK. Everyone stay calm.

704
01:27:47,012 --> 01:27:47,981
It's OK.

705
01:27:48,016 --> 01:27:49,276
It's a false alarm!

706
01:27:49,422 --> 01:27:51,150
Everyone back to your rooms.

707
01:27:51,190 --> 01:27:53,576
Are you crazy? Don't get in our way!

708
01:27:54,564 --> 01:27:56,883
I'll arrest you!

709
01:27:57,376 --> 01:28:01,949
–I'll sue you for abuse of power.
–There are 300 lives at stake here.

710
01:28:02,035 --> 01:28:02,963
I'll kill you!

711
01:28:03,522 --> 01:28:04,880
Be careful.

712
01:28:09,627 --> 01:28:10,781
Quickly!

713
01:28:11,555 --> 01:28:14,671
–Why don't you take them out?
–Everyone's gone.

714
01:28:15,211 --> 01:28:16,365
Get some help!

715
01:28:25,534 --> 01:28:27,324
Boss, all the men are here.

716
01:28:35,657 --> 01:28:36,784
We must evacuate!

717
01:28:37,143 --> 01:28:38,502
–Doctor?
–Carry on!

718
01:28:38,991 --> 01:28:40,913
The cops are up to something.

719
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:47,352
–Cut the mains. Stop them.
–OK.

720
01:28:57,710 --> 01:28:58,749
Get the babies!

721
01:29:03,735 --> 01:29:05,988
<i>–They're shooting!
–I know.</i>

722
01:29:11,407 --> 01:29:14,854
–You've caused all this!
–Take care of the patients!

723
01:29:15,424 --> 01:29:16,863
Doctor! Doctor!

724
01:29:25,386 --> 01:29:27,836
Stop! I'll shoot!
Come back! Come back!

725
01:29:27,877 --> 01:29:29,396
Get out!

726
01:29:30,247 --> 01:29:31,307
Did you hear me?

727
01:29:33,741 --> 01:29:34,621
It's OK, CID!

728
01:29:34,826 --> 01:29:36,345
Come back!

729
01:29:41,052 --> 01:29:42,510
Police! Drop your gun!

730
01:30:05,635 --> 01:30:07,624
The police have us surrounded.

731
01:30:15,838 --> 01:30:18,043
Take the patients hostage.

732
01:30:20,297 --> 01:30:23,752
They're just ordinary people
underneath their uniforms.

733
01:30:23,792 --> 01:30:25,951
They've got guns, so have we.

734
01:30:27,568 --> 01:30:29,026
They've only got .38s.

735
01:30:40,623 --> 01:30:41,502
Hurry!

736
01:30:52,673 --> 01:30:54,078
Get down!

737
01:30:54,360 --> 01:30:55,594
Don't move!

738
01:31:08,821 --> 01:31:10,107
Get out!
Put the babies down! Get out!

739
01:31:10,147 --> 01:31:11,472
Put the babies down!

740
01:31:11,954 --> 01:31:12,708
Hurry!

741
01:31:13,280 --> 01:31:14,685
Did you hear me?

742
01:31:18,221 --> 01:31:20,699
Lower your voice!
You'll scare them.

743
01:31:27,861 --> 01:31:29,940
Be good. Don't be scared.

744
01:31:51,963 --> 01:31:54,568
Now he wants to blow up the hospital.

745
01:31:55,056 --> 01:31:58,028
–How will you send the flowers?
–I already did.

746
01:31:58,068 --> 01:31:59,268
Telepathy?

747
01:32:00,077 --> 01:32:03,457
She doesn't realize
that I go through hell for her.

748
01:32:11,164 --> 01:32:13,019
Do you think you can escape?

749
01:32:16,586 --> 01:32:18,231
Long…

750
01:32:18,515 --> 01:32:19,508
I admired you.

751
01:32:20,322 --> 01:32:22,009
<i>I treated you as a friend.</i>

752
01:32:22,049 --> 01:32:24,219
<i>I never imagined you'd betray me.</i>

753
01:32:24,259 --> 01:32:25,452
You disappoint me.

754
01:32:26,227 --> 01:32:29,475
You'll be even more disappointed
when I kill you.

755
01:32:29,561 --> 01:32:30,967
<i>I've been after you.</i>

756
01:32:31,007 --> 01:32:34,180
Why the hospital?
Do you like killing the innocent?

757
01:32:34,221 --> 01:32:37,336
I like the risk.
I've got hundreds of hostages.

758
01:32:38,197 --> 01:32:40,125
<i>I've got an arms cache down there.</i>

759
01:32:40,166 --> 01:32:43,056
I'll detonate it
if you make me angry.

760
01:32:43,620 --> 01:32:45,939
–Try it.
–I mean it.

761
01:32:46,472 --> 01:32:49,717
My next arsenal
will be in a police station.

762
01:32:51,252 --> 01:32:52,246
That'll be fun.

763
01:32:57,237 --> 01:33:00,210
There are over 100 patients
being held hostage.

764
01:33:00,250 --> 01:33:02,172
The police haven't been able-

765
01:33:08,404 --> 01:33:09,929
–I'm scared!
–Get down!

766
01:33:32,466 --> 01:33:34,191
Unit 3… No filming!

767
01:33:39,013 --> 01:33:42,592
The wall's cold.
The morgue must be on the other side.

768
01:33:43,392 --> 01:33:45,551
Good, that's handy.

769
01:33:47,007 --> 01:33:49,128
Just leave me in there if I die.

770
01:33:52,510 --> 01:33:56,600
There are two of us here.
There's no time for self-pity.

771
01:33:57,290 --> 01:33:59,258
I wanted to protect the innocent.

772
01:33:59,299 --> 01:34:02,016
<i>But I've had to kill them as well.</i>

773
01:34:04,159 --> 01:34:06,081
I wanted to be a regular cop.

774
01:34:07,573 --> 01:34:09,562
There were no other positions.

775
01:34:10,345 --> 01:34:12,344
Undercover in the triads.

776
01:34:12,675 --> 01:34:14,594
Keep quiet.

777
01:34:15,929 --> 01:34:17,983
–Do you have any dreams?
–I do.

778
01:34:19,704 --> 01:34:21,626
I want to move to Antarctica.

779
01:34:22,115 --> 01:34:24,720
It's freezing there. You like that?

780
01:34:25,167 --> 01:34:27,337
At least I can come out of the dark.

781
01:34:27,377 --> 01:34:30,301
There's daylight
24 hours a day there.

782
01:34:36,013 --> 01:34:39,261
You can't just talk about it.
I have dreams, too.

783
01:34:39,267 --> 01:34:42,183
I wanted to be in a band
but I became a cop.

784
01:34:45,212 --> 01:34:47,783
All you can do is laugh. Come on.

785
01:35:26,867 --> 01:35:27,906
Don't move!

786
01:35:36,909 --> 01:35:37,983
The guy's a cop.

787
01:35:50,607 --> 01:35:52,171
Johnny, you're winning.

788
01:35:52,696 --> 01:35:56,606
Why not let the patients go?
It's just us against the cops.

789
01:35:56,954 --> 01:35:57,948
Are you scared?

790
01:35:58,962 --> 01:36:00,036
I'm not scared.

791
01:36:00,328 --> 01:36:04,901
I've been around a long time so
I know when things have gone too far.

792
01:36:05,228 --> 01:36:06,587
I don't care.

793
01:36:40,858 --> 01:36:42,663
Stop!

794
01:36:47,888 --> 01:36:49,695
–Don't move!
–Go and have a look!

795
01:36:49,736 --> 01:36:50,650
Don't move!

796
01:36:51,061 --> 01:36:53,139
Get down!

797
01:37:08,977 --> 01:37:10,541
I've got the cop!

798
01:37:19,180 --> 01:37:20,174
Bring him here!

799
01:37:20,425 --> 01:37:21,704
Go!

800
01:37:40,188 --> 01:37:41,707
Police! Get down!

801
01:37:42,357 --> 01:37:43,271
Get down!

802
01:38:11,038 --> 01:38:12,957
Go!

803
01:38:18,549 --> 01:38:19,543
Go!

804
01:38:19,714 --> 01:38:20,913
Help the patients!

805
01:38:29,154 --> 01:38:31,153
Hurry!

806
01:38:38,714 --> 01:38:40,437
I have to save the babies!

807
01:38:40,562 --> 01:38:41,689
I'll go with you.

808
01:38:56,630 --> 01:38:59,522
–There's so many of them.
–Quiet! You'll wake them.

809
01:38:59,562 --> 01:39:02,942
–Put cotton wool in their ears.
–Is that necessary?

810
01:39:33,947 --> 01:39:35,545
Be careful! I'm a cop!

811
01:39:35,995 --> 01:39:38,315
Do you want as many babies as this?

812
01:39:38,767 --> 01:39:39,960
I'm not a machine!

813
01:39:42,864 --> 01:39:43,744
Smile.

814
01:39:43,989 --> 01:39:45,381
–Are you ready?
–Yes.

815
01:39:53,027 --> 01:39:54,021
Inspector Yuen.

816
01:39:55,799 --> 01:39:57,079
Help Madam. Get the babies out.

817
01:39:57,119 --> 01:39:57,964
Over there.

818
01:39:58,088 --> 01:39:59,081
Be careful.

819
01:40:01,061 --> 01:40:04,905
I'm going to help Long.
You're in charge here. Be careful.

820
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:28,008
Upstairs.

821
01:40:32,272 --> 01:40:34,157
Madam, the exit's blocked!

822
01:40:36,128 --> 01:40:37,853
He's one of us!

823
01:40:44,082 --> 01:40:45,236
Get the babies!

824
01:40:48,018 --> 01:40:50,471
–Take the curtains down.
–Yes, Madam.

825
01:41:01,234 --> 01:41:02,227
Be careful.

826
01:41:12,963 --> 01:41:13,797
Help!

827
01:41:16,418 --> 01:41:19,003
–I'm dropping the baby!
–Pass it to me!

828
01:41:22,845 --> 01:41:25,430
–Over there.
–Put them in a safe place.

829
01:41:26,500 --> 01:41:28,899
Mun! It's OK! Mun!

830
01:42:12,172 --> 01:42:13,531
Did you get shot?

831
01:42:14,382 --> 01:42:15,906
–Can you hold on?
–Yes.

832
01:42:50,775 --> 01:42:52,054
Go!

833
01:43:04,071 --> 01:43:05,590
I just killed a cop.

834
01:43:07,726 --> 01:43:08,606
No…

835
01:43:10,297 --> 01:43:12,185
–I'm sure he was a cop.
–He wasn't!

836
01:43:12,225 --> 01:43:13,550
He had a badge!

837
01:43:14,956 --> 01:43:16,555
You were hallucinating!

838
01:43:17,166 --> 01:43:20,540
How many times do I have to say it?
He wasn't a cop!

839
01:43:20,580 --> 01:43:22,147
You're your own worst enemy.

840
01:43:22,187 --> 01:43:26,296
If you can't conquer your fears,
how can you beat anyone else?

841
01:43:29,016 --> 01:43:29,929
Take this!

842
01:43:51,992 --> 01:43:54,884
I killed a cop
in the course of this investigation.

843
01:43:54,925 --> 01:43:56,078
Pang told me.

844
01:43:57,174 --> 01:43:59,459
I didn't realize until afterwards.

845
01:43:59,986 --> 01:44:01,113
How did you feel?

846
01:44:01,271 --> 01:44:02,862
Worse than you did then.

847
01:44:04,003 --> 01:44:06,124
–Then he really was a cop?
–Yes!

848
01:44:06,453 --> 01:44:07,527
Shit!

849
01:44:51,523 --> 01:44:53,047
Go and save the babies!

850
01:45:32,214 --> 01:45:33,539
Be careful.

851
01:45:39,244 --> 01:45:41,033
–Catch!
–OK, pass it to me!

852
01:45:42,015 --> 01:45:43,008
No reaction.

853
01:45:44,586 --> 01:45:45,865
Whose baby is this?

854
01:46:04,831 --> 01:46:05,711
Go and help!

855
01:46:06,639 --> 01:46:07,567
Pass it to me!

856
01:46:09,009 --> 01:46:10,002
Catch!

857
01:46:24,393 --> 01:46:25,958
Is this your baby?

858
01:46:28,531 --> 01:46:29,658
Someone's coming!

859
01:46:46,366 --> 01:46:47,439
You bitch!

860
01:46:54,641 --> 01:46:57,292
We need help up here
to save the babies!

861
01:47:00,987 --> 01:47:02,795
–I'll go.
–I'll deal with him.

862
01:47:02,835 --> 01:47:03,669
Be careful.

863
01:47:08,138 --> 01:47:10,524
Don't be scared. We'll hide in here.

864
01:47:38,345 --> 01:47:39,224
Quickly!

865
01:47:54,332 --> 01:47:55,106
Careful.

866
01:47:56,099 --> 01:47:57,458
Go quickly.

867
01:47:59,594 --> 01:48:01,251
I left one of the babies!

868
01:48:01,442 --> 01:48:02,515
OK, I'll get it.

869
01:48:03,008 --> 01:48:04,930
–Look after her.
–Be careful!

870
01:48:06,463 --> 01:48:08,716
Put these all around the hospital.

871
01:48:30,002 --> 01:48:31,156
Madam, hold on!

872
01:48:43,298 --> 01:48:44,497
Quiet now.

873
01:48:44,664 --> 01:48:45,923
Quiet now. Be good.

874
01:48:52,256 --> 01:48:53,135
Be quiet!

875
01:48:55,790 --> 01:48:57,447
Be good. I'll rap to you.

876
01:49:18,446 --> 01:49:19,705
I know I can't rap…

877
01:49:20,575 --> 01:49:22,574
so you don't have to pretend.

878
01:49:30,416 --> 01:49:32,176
Don't watch.

879
01:49:54,638 --> 01:49:55,963
Baby…

880
01:50:06,207 --> 01:50:07,280
Sorry.

881
01:50:12,473 --> 01:50:14,602
All this bloodshed
was in a good cause.

882
01:50:14,642 --> 01:50:16,207
You're so cute.

883
01:51:23,050 --> 01:51:24,729
Nurse.

884
01:51:24,858 --> 01:51:26,316
Take the patients out.

885
01:51:28,915 --> 01:51:29,964
Go.

886
01:51:29,999 --> 01:51:30,879
Quickly!

887
01:51:37,712 --> 01:51:38,991
No!

888
01:51:59,042 --> 01:52:00,241
Are you crazy?

889
01:52:01,492 --> 01:52:02,950
Why did you kill them?

890
01:52:03,139 --> 01:52:07,049
I'll kill whoever gets in my way.
Always getting in my way…

891
01:52:54,716 --> 01:52:56,361
–Shoot!
–Drop it!

892
01:52:58,130 --> 01:52:59,250
Shoot!

893
01:52:59,898 --> 01:53:03,344
I'll blow this place up.
You want to take that risk?

894
01:53:06,164 --> 01:53:08,152
<i>We'll all die together.</i>

895
01:53:10,944 --> 01:53:13,131
I can't be beaten. You won't win.

896
01:53:17,130 --> 01:53:18,455
No!

897
01:53:20,424 --> 01:53:21,683
It's too dangerous.

898
01:53:23,196 --> 01:53:24,322
Get the baby out.

899
01:53:25,003 --> 01:53:26,660
You'll die. Come with me!

900
01:53:48,462 --> 01:53:49,456
I'm a cop, too.

901
01:53:55,331 --> 01:53:56,485
Don't go!

902
01:54:37,709 --> 01:54:39,565
Get the injured out of here.

903
01:54:48,836 --> 01:54:50,360
We're going for a ride.

904
01:55:40,654 --> 01:55:42,573
You saved the day.

905
01:55:42,863 --> 01:55:43,743
Thank you.

906
01:55:48,447 --> 01:55:49,726
Over there!

907
01:56:25,081 --> 01:56:28,166
–Tequila, any more babies?
–Thank you!

908
01:56:29,017 --> 01:56:30,743
–My baby!
–Thank you!

909
01:56:31,146 --> 01:56:32,300
Thank you!

910
01:56:33,115 --> 01:56:34,904
–Are you OK?
–Where's Long?

911
01:56:36,248 --> 01:56:37,402
Upstairs.

912
01:56:40,787 --> 01:56:42,444
There's someone upstairs.

913
01:57:07,138 --> 01:57:08,017
Get up!

914
01:57:10,432 --> 01:57:11,471
Drop your guns!

915
01:57:13,002 --> 01:57:13,605
Drop your guns.

916
01:57:13,645 --> 01:57:14,638
Drop them!

917
01:57:15,292 --> 01:57:16,251
Move back!

918
01:57:40,518 --> 01:57:41,844
The hard boiled cop.

919
01:57:42,286 --> 01:57:43,479
You're still here.

920
01:57:45,379 --> 01:57:47,217
We both lost some men.

921
01:57:47,789 --> 01:57:48,916
We're about even.

922
01:57:50,721 --> 01:57:52,366
I'll win if I kill him.

923
01:57:54,899 --> 01:57:56,463
Shoot!

924
01:57:57,992 --> 01:57:58,985
Shoot.

925
01:57:59,157 --> 01:58:00,681
I'll blow his head off.

926
01:58:04,620 --> 01:58:06,059
Don't shoot.

927
01:58:07,632 --> 01:58:08,693
You're impotent.

928
01:58:09,641 --> 01:58:13,816
I thought you were a superhero
but you're just an ordinary man.

929
01:58:15,586 --> 01:58:16,659
Slap yourself.

930
01:58:23,620 --> 01:58:24,944
And the other side.

931
01:58:32,055 --> 01:58:33,381
Say, “I'm impotent.”

932
01:58:37,317 --> 01:58:38,197
I'm impotent.

933
01:58:45,030 --> 01:58:45,909
Kneel down.

934
01:58:52,822 --> 01:58:53,750
Drop your gun.

935
01:58:55,474 --> 01:58:58,589
How often does someone
humiliate you like this?

936
01:58:59,691 --> 01:59:00,925
A .38.

937
01:59:02,825 --> 01:59:04,389
Take your trousers off.

938
01:59:04,833 --> 01:59:07,404
You bastard, eat shit.

939
02:00:11,192 --> 02:00:12,518
<i>It's for you.</i>

940
02:00:14,004 --> 02:00:15,528
<i>I had forgotten.</i>

941
02:00:16,053 --> 02:00:20,692
<i>Birthdays aren't important
when you don't have a real identity.</i>

942
02:00:21,114 --> 02:00:23,831
<i>Only you know when my birthday is.</i>

943
02:00:25,051 --> 02:00:26,840
<i>Don't you forget it.</i>

944
02:00:29,951 --> 02:00:31,719
<i>–Do you have any dreams?
–I do.</i>

945
02:00:31,759 --> 02:00:34,145
<i>I want to move to Antarctica.</i>

946
02:00:34,651 --> 02:00:37,435
<i>It's freezing there. You like that?</i>

947
02:00:37,623 --> 02:00:40,473
<i>At least I can come out of the dark.</i>
