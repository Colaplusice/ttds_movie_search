00:01:00,592 --> 00:01:03,186
Hello.

4
00:01:03,262 --> 00:01:05,628
What?

5
00:01:05,697 --> 00:01:09,098
No, I don't work today.

6
00:01:09,168 --> 00:01:11,398
I'm playing hockey at 2:00.

7
00:01:13,939 --> 00:01:17,033
Why don't you call Randal?

8
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,703
'Cause I'm fuckin' tired!

9
00:01:21,446 --> 00:01:24,711
I just closed last night.

10
00:01:24,784 --> 00:01:26,717
Jesus.

11
00:01:26,785 --> 00:01:30,050
What time do you think
you're gonna come in, 12:00?

12
00:01:32,157 --> 00:01:34,990
Be there by 12:00? Where?

13
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:38,588
Swear you'll be there by 12:00
and I'll do it.

14
00:01:38,664 --> 00:01:41,155
12:00, or I walk.

- # Ooh- hoo #
- Thanks. Have a good one.

49
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:15,077
- Do you mind if I drink this here?
- Go ahead.

50
00:05:15,148 --> 00:05:17,082
- You open?
- Yeah.

51
00:05:18,584 --> 00:05:21,178
- Pack of cigarettes.
- Are you sure?

52
00:05:21,254 --> 00:05:23,517
- Am I sure?
- Are you sure?

53
00:05:23,589 --> 00:05:26,682
- About what?
- Do you really wanna buy those?

54
00:05:26,758 --> 00:05:29,352
- Are you serious?
- How long you been smoking?

55
00:05:29,428 --> 00:05:32,193
- What is this, a poll?
- How long you been a smoker?

56
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,961
I don't know.
Since I was about 13.

57
00:05:35,034 --> 00:05:38,128
Thirteen.
Let's see, you're about 19, 20?

58
00:05:38,203 --> 00:05:41,570
- Am I right?
- What in the hell is that?

59
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,135
That's your lung.
By this time, your lung looks like this.

60
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:49,477
- You've gotta be shitting me.
- You think I'm shitting you?

61
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:51,982
- Here.
- What's this?

62
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:53,541
A trach ring.

63
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:56,815
They install it in your throat
when cancer takes your voice box.

64
00:05:56,888 --> 00:06:00,324
- This one came out of a 60-year-old man.
- Oh, God!

65
00:06:00,392 --> 00:06:02,987
He smoked until the day he died.

66
00:06:03,062 --> 00:06:05,427
He used to put the cigarette
in and smoke that way.

67
00:06:05,497 --> 00:06:07,897
- Excuse me, but...
- This is where you're heading.

68
00:06:07,966 --> 00:06:10,663
Cruddy lung, smoking through
a hole in your throat.

69
00:06:10,736 --> 00:06:13,500
- Do you want that?
- If it's already too late, I guess...

70
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:18,476
No, it's never too late. Put the cigarettes
back, and try some gum instead.

71
00:06:18,543 --> 00:06:21,513
- Here. Chewlies gum. Try this.
- It's not the same.

72
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:25,016
It's cheaper than cigarettes,
and it certainly beats this.

73
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:28,747
- Oh, Jesus!
- It's a picture of a cancer-ridden lung.

74
00:06:28,821 --> 00:06:30,845
Keep it.

75
00:06:30,922 --> 00:06:33,789
- I'll just take the gum.
- Fifty five.

76
00:06:33,859 --> 00:06:36,953
You made a very wise choice.
Keep up the good work.

77
00:06:39,531 --> 00:06:43,297
If you're gonna drink that coffee,
I think you oughta take it outside.

78
00:06:43,369 --> 00:06:47,430
- I think I'll drink it in here. Thanks.
- If you're gonna drink it here,

79
00:06:47,507 --> 00:06:49,974
I'd appreciate it if you don't bother
the customers.

80
00:06:50,041 --> 00:06:53,477
Okay.
I'm sorry about that.

81
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:58,980
- Pack of cigarettes. What's that?
- This?

82
00:06:59,051 --> 00:07:01,518
How long you been smoking?

83
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:08,317
# Kill the drummer

84
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:13,491
# Kill the bass player
Kill both bass players

85
00:07:13,566 --> 00:07:17,160
# This song is the reason
Why I'm now going deaf #

86
00:07:17,235 --> 00:07:21,172
Let's kick some ass! Yeah!

87
00:07:28,413 --> 00:07:31,280
I feel good today, Silent Bob.
We're gonna make some money.

88
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:34,285
Know what we're gonna do?
Go to that party and get some pussy.

89
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:40,621
I'm gonna fuck this bitch.
I'll fuck anything that moves!

90
00:07:40,693 --> 00:07:43,287
What the fuck you lookin' at?
I'll kick your fuckin' ass!

91
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:46,626
Shit, yeah. Don't that motherfucker
owe me ten bucks?

92
00:07:46,699 --> 00:07:51,136
Tonight we're going to rip off
this fucker's head, take out his fuckin' soul.

93
00:07:51,203 --> 00:07:55,138
Remind me if he tries to buy something.
I'm gonna shit in the motherfucker's bag.

94
00:07:55,207 --> 00:07:59,473
- [Girl laughing]
- What's up, baby? What's up, sluts?

95
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,708
Yeah. So, Bob, you're a rude
motherfucker, you know that?

96
00:08:02,782 --> 00:08:06,148
You're cute as hell.
I could go down on you, suck you,

97
00:08:06,217 --> 00:08:09,311
line up three other guys,
make like a circus seal.

98
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:12,482
Hey, you fucking faggot?
I hate guys.

99
00:08:12,558 --> 00:08:14,890
I love women!

100
00:08:14,961 --> 00:08:16,895
What you want, Grizzly Adams?

101
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,826
You're spending what, 20, maybe 30
dollars a week on your cigarettes?

102
00:08:21,933 --> 00:08:23,992
- Forty.
- Fifty three.

103
00:08:24,069 --> 00:08:27,164
Fifty three dollars a week
on cigarettes! Come on!

104
00:08:27,239 --> 00:08:29,832
Would you give somebody
that much each week to kill you?

105
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:34,107
That's what you're doing now by paying
for this so called privilege to smoke!

106
00:08:34,180 --> 00:08:36,204
We're gonna croak sometime.

107
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,776
It's that mentality that allows
the cancer producing industry to thrive.

108
00:08:40,853 --> 00:08:44,949
Of course we're all gonna die someday!
Do we have to pay for it?

109
00:08:45,024 --> 00:08:47,959
Do we have to throw hard earned
dollars on the counter...

110
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,961
and say, "Please, Mr. Merchant of Death,
sir, please,

111
00:08:51,030 --> 00:08:54,124
"sell me something that will
stink up my breath and clothes,

112
00:08:54,199 --> 00:08:57,226
- and fry my lungs!"
- [Dante] Now, wait a second.

113
00:08:57,303 --> 00:09:01,238
Here comes the speech about how he's
just doing his job by following orders.

114
00:09:01,307 --> 00:09:05,141
Let me tell you about another group
of hate mongers who followed orders.

115
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:07,645
- Who's that?
- They were called Nazis!

116
00:09:07,712 --> 00:09:09,510
- That's right.
- Friggin' Nazi.

117
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:12,142
They practically wiped
an entire nation off the Earth,

118
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:14,152
like your cigarettes are doing now!

119
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,485
- [Dante] I think you'd oughta leave.
- You want me to leave. Why?

120
00:09:17,556 --> 00:09:21,993
'Cause somebody's telling it like it is,
giving these fine people a wake up call?

121
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:25,396
No, you're loitering
and causing a disturbance.

122
00:09:25,463 --> 00:09:28,159
I'm a disturbance?
You're the disturbance, pal.

123
00:09:28,233 --> 00:09:32,603
Here, now I am a customer.
I'm gonna buy some Chewlies gum.

124
00:09:32,671 --> 00:09:36,267
I'm a customer engaged in a discussion
with the other customers.

125
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:39,106
- That's right.
- Smoke my big fat cock!

126
00:09:39,178 --> 00:09:42,943
He's scared now
'cause he sees the threat we present.

127
00:09:43,014 --> 00:09:45,710
He smells the change is coming!

128
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:49,482
You are the source in this area,
and we're gonna shut you down for good!

129
00:09:49,555 --> 00:09:51,489
For good, cancer merchant!

130
00:09:51,557 --> 00:09:54,320
[Chanting]
Cancer merchant! Cancer merchant!

131
00:09:59,197 --> 00:10:01,359
Who's leading this mob?

132
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:04,562
[Coughing]
That guy.

133
00:10:04,637 --> 00:10:06,968
- [Coughing continues]
- [Woman] Freeze!

134
00:10:13,212 --> 00:10:16,648
Let's see some credentials.
Slowly!

135
00:10:19,885 --> 00:10:22,649
- You're a Chewlies gum representative?
- [Man] Chewlies?

136
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:27,317
You're stirring up anti-smoking
sentiment to, what, sell more gum?

137
00:10:27,392 --> 00:10:29,657
Get out of here!

138
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:34,499
And you people, don't you have jobs
to go to? Get out of here. Go commute.

139
00:10:34,567 --> 00:10:38,503
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves.
A bunch of easily led automatons.

140
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:42,666
Try thinking for yourselves before you
pelt an innocent man with cigarettes!

141
00:10:42,741 --> 00:10:47,509
[Coughing, clears throat]

142
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,174
Uh, pack of cigarettes?

143
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,152
Don't you think you're taking
this too hard?

144
00:11:01,293 --> 00:11:06,196
I have enough indignities in my life and
people start throwing cigarettes at me.

145
00:11:06,265 --> 00:11:09,200
- At least they weren't lit.
- I hate this fucking place.

146
00:11:09,267 --> 00:11:11,702
Then quit.
You should be going to school anyway.

147
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,035
Veronica, the last thing I need is a lecture.

148
00:11:14,106 --> 00:11:17,040
All I'm saying is, if you're
that unhappy, you should leave.

149
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:20,044
- I'm not even supposed to be here today!
- I know.

150
00:11:20,112 --> 00:11:23,206
I stopped by your house.
Your mom told me you left, at 6:00.

151
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:26,046
The guy got sick.
He couldn't come in.

152
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:28,881
- Don't you have a hockey game at 2:00?
- Yes.

153
00:11:28,954 --> 00:11:32,219
I'm gonna play like shit because
I didn't have a good night's sleep.

154
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:34,885
- Why'd you agree to come in?
- I'm only here until 12:00.

155
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:37,155
After that, I'm gone.
The boss comes in.

156
00:11:37,229 --> 00:11:41,165
- Why don't you open the shutters?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

157
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:44,225
- You're kidding.
- Bunch of savages in this town.

158
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:53,169
- Thanks.
- How much did you leave up there?

159
00:11:53,245 --> 00:11:56,237
Three dollars in mixed change
and a couple of singles.

160
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,182
This time in the morning,
people just get a paper or coffee.

161
00:11:59,251 --> 00:12:01,845
- You're trusting.
- Why do you say that?

162
00:12:01,921 --> 00:12:05,914
How do you know they're taking the right
change or paying for what they take?

163
00:12:05,991 --> 00:12:08,687
Theoretically, people see money,
no one around,

164
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:10,695
they think they're being watched.

165
00:12:10,763 --> 00:12:12,856
Honesty through paranoia.

166
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:15,025
Why do you smell like shoe polish?

167
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:17,534
I needed shoe polish
to make that sign out there.

168
00:12:17,603 --> 00:12:20,697
- Smell won't come off.
- [Door opens]

169
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:23,173
You think anybody
can see us down here?

170
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:25,210
Why, you wanna have sex or something?

171
00:12:25,277 --> 00:12:27,370
- Can we?
- Really?

172
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:30,540
- I was kidding.
- Like you can't get enough of me.

173
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:33,983
- Typically male point of view.
- How do you figure?

174
00:12:34,053 --> 00:12:37,318
Show some bedroom proficiency,
you think you're gods.

175
00:12:37,389 --> 00:12:39,653
- What about what we do for you?
- Women?

176
00:12:39,725 --> 00:12:42,922
Women as lovers are basically the same.
They just have to be there.

177
00:12:42,995 --> 00:12:44,019
Be there?

178
00:12:44,096 --> 00:12:46,826
Making a male climax
isn't at all challenging.

179
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:50,835
Insert somewhere close,
preferably moist, thrust, repeat.

180
00:12:50,903 --> 00:12:52,837
How flattering.

181
00:12:52,905 --> 00:12:55,840
Now, making a woman come,
therein lies a challenge.

182
00:12:55,908 --> 00:12:57,466
You think so?

183
00:12:57,611 --> 00:13:00,603
A woman makes a guy come,
it's standard.

184
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:03,239
A guy makes a woman come,
it's talent.

185
00:13:03,315 --> 00:13:06,011
- And I actually date you?
- Something wrong?

186
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:10,522
I'm insulted. Believe me, Don Juan, it
takes more than that to get a guy off.

187
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:13,353
Just being there, as you put it,
is not enough.

188
00:13:13,426 --> 00:13:14,790
I've touched a nerve.

189
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:17,829
I'm astonished to hear you
trivialize my role in our sex life.

190
00:13:17,897 --> 00:13:20,525
It wasn't directed at you.
It's a broad generalization.

191
00:13:20,599 --> 00:13:23,033
You're making a generalization
about broads.

192
00:13:23,102 --> 00:13:25,161
Those are my opinions
based on the few women

193
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,535
who were goodly enough
to sleep with me.

194
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:29,699
- How many?
- How many what?

195
00:13:29,775 --> 00:13:32,471
How many different girls
have you slept with?

196
00:13:32,544 --> 00:13:35,308
- Didn't we have this discussion before?
- We might have.

197
00:13:35,381 --> 00:13:38,475
- I don't remember. How many?
- Including you?

198
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:41,144
It better be up to and including me.

199
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:44,712
- Twelve.
- You slept with 12 different girls?

200
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,758
Including you? Yes.

201
00:13:46,825 --> 00:13:48,918
- Ow! What'd you do that for?
- You're a pig!

202
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:49,983
Why'd you hit me?

203
00:13:50,062 --> 00:13:51,996
Do you know how many men
I've had sex with?

204
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:54,555
- Do I get to hit you after you tell me?
- Three.

205
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,931
- Three?
- Three, including you.

206
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:58,663
You only slept with three people?

207
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:00,672
- I'm not the pig you are.
- Who?

208
00:14:00,739 --> 00:14:03,606
- You!
- No, who are the three, besides me.

209
00:14:03,676 --> 00:14:06,839
- John Franson and Rob Stanslyk.
- Wow.

210
00:14:06,912 --> 00:14:09,779
That's why you should feel like a pig.
You men make me sick.

211
00:14:09,848 --> 00:14:13,545
- You'll sleep with anything that says yes.
- Animal, mineral or vegetable.

212
00:14:13,619 --> 00:14:15,177
Vegetable, meaning paraplegic.

213
00:14:15,254 --> 00:14:17,518
They put up
the least amount of struggle.

214
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:20,183
After dropping a bombshell like that,
you owe me big.

215
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:21,692
Name it.

216
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,695
I want you to come with me on Monday.

217
00:14:23,762 --> 00:14:25,162
- Where?
- To school.

218
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:28,461
There's a seminar about getting
back into a scholastic program

219
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,468
after a lapse in enrollment.

220
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:32,471
Can't we have a discussion
without that?

221
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:34,130
It's important to me, Dante.

222
00:14:34,206 --> 00:14:36,835
You have so much potential
going to waste in this pit.

223
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:40,640
- I wish you'd go back to school.
- Stop. You're making my head hurt.

224
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,682
- Shit! Why're you getting up?
- I have class in 45 minutes.

225
00:14:45,884 --> 00:14:47,819
Willam?

226
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:50,354
Hey, Ronni.
How you been, man?

227
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:53,288
What, do you work here now?

228
00:14:53,392 --> 00:14:56,692
No, I was visiting my man.

229
00:14:56,762 --> 00:15:00,357
Dante, this is Willam Black.
This is Dante Hicks, my boyfriend.

230
00:15:00,432 --> 00:15:04,869
- How you doing? Just the soda?
- No, and a pack of cigarettes.

231
00:15:04,937 --> 00:15:09,033
So where you been, man?
Still going to Seton Hall?

232
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:13,408
No, I transferred into Monmouth
this year. I was tired of missing him.

233
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:16,743
That's beautiful, man.

234
00:15:16,815 --> 00:15:19,045
So, you still talk to Silvan?

235
00:15:19,118 --> 00:15:22,246
I just talked to her on Monday.
We still hang out on weekends.

236
00:15:22,321 --> 00:15:24,255
Oh, that's great.

237
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:28,124
Well, you two lovebirds
take it easy, okay?

238
00:15:28,193 --> 00:15:31,186
Bye. Take it easy.

239
00:15:31,264 --> 00:15:34,926
- [Ronni] That was Snowball.
- [Dante] Why do you call him that?

240
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:38,731
Silvan made it up.
It's a blow job thing.

241
00:15:38,804 --> 00:15:40,738
What do you mean?

242
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:44,367
After the blow job, he likes to have it
spit back into his mouth while kissing.

243
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:46,377
It's called snowballing.

244
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:49,210
- He requests this?
- He gets off on it.

245
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:52,547
- Silvan can be talked into anything.
- Why do you say that?

246
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:55,052
Like you said, she snowballed him.

247
00:15:55,121 --> 00:15:59,217
- Silvan? No, I snowballed him.
- Yeah, right.

248
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:01,384
I'm serious.

249
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:05,055
- You sucked that guy's dick?
- Yeah. How do you think I knew...

250
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,897
You said you had sex with three guys.
You never mentioned him.

251
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:11,731
- Because I never had sex with him.
- You sucked his dick!

252
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:14,739
We went out a few times.
We never had sex, but we fooled around.

253
00:16:14,808 --> 00:16:17,901
Oh, my God. Why did you tell me
you only had sex with three guys?

254
00:16:17,976 --> 00:16:20,410
Because I did only have sex
with three guys.

255
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:23,915
- Doesn't mean I didn't go with people.
- I feel so nauseous.

256
00:16:23,982 --> 00:16:25,917
I'm sorry.
I thought you understood.

257
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:27,509
I did understand!

258
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:30,522
That you had sex with three guys
and that's all you said!

259
00:16:30,589 --> 00:16:32,523
- Please calm down.
- How many?

260
00:16:32,591 --> 00:16:34,855
- How many dicks have you sucked?
- Let it go!

261
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,452
Shut up and I'll tell you. Jesus!

262
00:16:36,529 --> 00:16:39,292
I didn't freak out when you told me
how many girls you fucked!

263
00:16:39,364 --> 00:16:42,266
This is different. This is important.
How many?

264
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,213
Well?

265
00:16:56,850 --> 00:17:01,377
- Something like 36.
- What? Something like 36?

266
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:04,217
- Lower your voice.
- What is that? "Something like 36"?

267
00:17:04,289 --> 00:17:06,224
Does that include me?

268
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:10,053
- Uh... 37.
- I'm 37?

269
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:13,394
- I'm going to class.
- Oh, my God.

270
00:17:13,465 --> 00:17:17,664
- 37! My girlfriend sucked 37 dicks!
- In a row?

271
00:17:17,737 --> 00:17:21,069
- Where you going?
- Listen, jerk. Until today, you never knew

272
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:23,904
how many guys I slept with
because you never bothered to ask.

273
00:17:23,976 --> 00:17:27,743
You act all nonchalant about fucking
12 girls. I never had sex with 12 guys!

274
00:17:27,814 --> 00:17:30,304
- You sucked enough dick!
- I went down on a few guys.

275
00:17:30,382 --> 00:17:33,351
- A few?
- One was you. The last one, I might add.

276
00:17:33,418 --> 00:17:37,514
Which, if you're too stupid to comprehend,
means I've been faithful since we met.

277
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:41,356
All the others I went with before I met you.
If you want to have a complex, go ahead.

278
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:44,863
Don't look at me like the town whore,
you were plenty busy before you met me.

279
00:17:44,931 --> 00:17:48,696
Why couldn't you sleep with them
like any other decent person?

280
00:17:48,767 --> 00:17:50,701
Because going down isn't a big deal.

281
00:17:50,770 --> 00:17:53,705
I liked a guy, we'd make out,
and I'd go down on him.

282
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:56,536
- But I only had sex with the guys I loved.
- I feel sick.

283
00:17:56,609 --> 00:17:58,405
I love you!
Don't feel sick.

284
00:17:58,477 --> 00:18:00,946
Every time I kiss you,
I'm gonna taste 36 other guys.

285
00:18:01,014 --> 00:18:03,812
I'm going to school.
Maybe later you'll be more rational.

286
00:18:03,883 --> 00:18:06,579
- I'm 37! I just can't...
- Goodbye, Dante!

287
00:18:09,121 --> 00:18:13,058
Hey, try not to suck any dick
on the way through the parking lot!

288
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:15,651
Hey! Hey, you!
Get back here.

289
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:25,566
I thought that place was supposed
to be open at 11:00. It's 11:20.

290
00:18:25,638 --> 00:18:29,004
I've already called his house twice.
He'll be here soon.

291
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:32,670
Hey, it's not like
it's a demanding job over there.

292
00:18:32,745 --> 00:18:35,339
I'd like to get paid
to sit on my ass and watch TV.

293
00:18:35,415 --> 00:18:38,350
I walked in the other day,
that son of a bitch was sleeping.

294
00:18:38,417 --> 00:18:41,182
- I'm sure he wasn't sleeping.
- Are you calling me a liar?

295
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:45,122
- Are you calling me a liar?
- No! He was probably resting his eyes.

296
00:18:45,191 --> 00:18:47,523
What the hell is that,
"resting his eyes"?

297
00:18:47,594 --> 00:18:51,461
- Like he's some air traffic controller?
- Actually, that's his night job.

298
00:18:51,530 --> 00:18:54,966
Wise ass too, huh?
Go ahead. Keep cracking wise.

299
00:18:55,034 --> 00:18:58,367
That's why you jockey a register
in some fuckin' convenience store

300
00:18:58,438 --> 00:19:00,701
instead of working at a steady job.

301
00:19:00,772 --> 00:19:04,539
I've got no time to bullshit around,
waiting for that son of a bitch.

302
00:19:04,611 --> 00:19:06,635
Make sure he gets that.

303
00:19:06,712 --> 00:19:11,241
The number's 812. My name's Wynarski.
I wanted a movie tonight.

304
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:13,877
If you tell me the movie title,
he'll hold it for you.

305
00:19:13,953 --> 00:19:17,888
Don't hurt yourself, buddy.
I'll go to Big Choice Video instead.

306
00:19:19,959 --> 00:19:23,053
[Door opens, closes]

307
00:19:23,129 --> 00:19:25,756
You forgot your keys.

308
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:40,341
- Guy ain't here yet.
- You're kidding! It's almost 11:30.

309
00:19:40,413 --> 00:19:45,349
- I've been here since 11:00.
- I hate it when I can't rent videos!

310
00:19:45,418 --> 00:19:48,682
I would've went to Big Choice,
but the tape I want is on that wall.

311
00:19:48,754 --> 00:19:50,780
- Really? Which one?
- Dental School.

312
00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:53,348
You came for that too?
That's the movie I came for.

313
00:19:53,426 --> 00:19:55,360
- I have first dibs.
- Says who?

314
00:19:55,427 --> 00:19:58,693
Says me. I've been here half an hour.
I'd call that first dibs.

315
00:19:58,764 --> 00:20:02,360
- Ain't gonna happen. I'm getting it.
- Like hell you are.

316
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,029
I'll bet you 20 bucks
you don't get to rent that tape.

317
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,038
- Twenty bucks?
- Twenty bucks.

318
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:10,564
All right, asshole. You're on.

319
00:20:26,958 --> 00:20:28,550
You're late.

320
00:20:28,628 --> 00:20:31,927
- What are you doing here?
- The boss called. Arthur fell ill.

321
00:20:31,998 --> 00:20:34,967
- Why are the shutters closed?
- Someone jammed gum in the locks.

322
00:20:35,034 --> 00:20:37,559
- Bunch of savages in this town.
- That's what I said.

323
00:20:37,637 --> 00:20:40,833
If I'd known you were here,
I'd have come even later.

324
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,841
- What smells like shoe polish?
- Go open the store.

325
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:52,076
- Hey, you see a set of keys around here?
- No time for love, Dr. Jones.

326
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:56,085
Fucking kids.

327
00:21:17,509 --> 00:21:20,206
Some guy just came in
refusing to pay late fees.

328
00:21:20,279 --> 00:21:23,942
Said the store was closed for two hours
yesterday. I tore up his membership.

329
00:21:24,016 --> 00:21:25,449
Shocking abuse of authority.

330
00:21:25,518 --> 00:21:28,419
I'm a firm believer
in the philosophy of a ruling class,

331
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,818
especially since I rule.

332
00:21:29,988 --> 00:21:33,720
- [Randal] Want something to drink?
- [Dante] No, thanks.

333
00:21:33,792 --> 00:21:36,057
Who was on your phone
this morning, like, 2:30?

334
00:21:36,129 --> 00:21:38,290
- I was trying to call for half an hour.
- Why?

335
00:21:38,364 --> 00:21:41,925
I wanted to use your car.
Snack cake.

336
00:21:43,069 --> 00:21:44,058
You don't wanna know.

337
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,071
- You call Caitlin again?
- She called me.

338
00:21:46,139 --> 00:21:49,404
- You tell Veronica?
- One fight a day is all I can stomach.

339
00:21:49,475 --> 00:21:52,342
- What do you fight about?
- We don't fight about anything.

340
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:55,539
She wants me to leave here, go
back to school, get some direction.

341
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:58,175
I bet the most frequent
topic of argument is Caitlin.

342
00:21:58,251 --> 00:22:00,549
- You win.
- I'm going to offer you some advice.

343
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:04,420
Let the past be the past. Forget Caitlin.
You been with Veronica how long?

344
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,754
- Seven months.
- Chick's nuts about you.

345
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,850
- How long you date Caitlin?
- Five years.

346
00:22:08,928 --> 00:22:11,419
Chick made you nuts.
She cheated on you how many times?

347
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:13,431
- Eight and a half.
- Eight and a half?

348
00:22:13,499 --> 00:22:16,832
Party at John Kay's, senior year.
I pass out in his bedroom.

349
00:22:16,903 --> 00:22:19,599
- Caitlin jumps all over me.
- So that's cheating?

350
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:23,108
- In the middle of it she called me Brad.
- She called you Brad?

351
00:22:23,176 --> 00:22:25,974
That's not cheating.
People say crazy shit during sex.

352
00:22:26,045 --> 00:22:29,105
- One time, I called this girl "mom."
- I hit the light, she freaks.

353
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:31,616
- She thought I was Brad Michaelson.
- What?

354
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,881
She was supposed to meet Brad
in a dark room. Picked the wrong one.

355
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,046
- She didn't know I was at the party.
- God.

356
00:22:37,123 --> 00:22:39,557
- Great story, huh?
- That girl was vile to you.

357
00:22:39,625 --> 00:22:42,890
Interesting postscript.
Know who wound up in there with Brad?

358
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:44,486
- Your mother?
- Alan Harris.

359
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:48,000
- Chess team Alan Harris?
- The two moved to Idaho together.

360
00:22:48,067 --> 00:22:49,056
They raise sheep.

361
00:22:49,135 --> 00:22:51,729
- Frightening.
- Different strokes to move the world.

362
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:55,501
I don't see how you could romanticize
your relationship with Caitlin.

363
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:58,339
She broke your heart
and drove men to deviant lifestyles.

364
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:00,379
- There was a lot of good.
- Oh, yeah?

365
00:23:00,446 --> 00:23:02,744
Aside from the cheating,
we were a great couple.

366
00:23:02,815 --> 00:23:06,410
That's what high school was about.
Algebra, bad lunch and infidelity.

367
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,080
- Think things will be different this time?
- They are.

368
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,420
When she calls me now, she's different.
Frightened, vulnerable.

369
00:23:12,492 --> 00:23:15,984
She's finishing college
and about to enter the real world.

370
00:23:16,062 --> 00:23:18,656
- Shit, I gotta place an order.
- Talkin' to myself.

371
00:23:18,731 --> 00:23:22,429
- I'm listening. She's leaving college...?
- And she's looking for support.

372
00:23:22,501 --> 00:23:24,800
This is leading our relationship
to a new level.

373
00:23:24,871 --> 00:23:25,929
What about Veronica?

374
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:28,940
The arguments Veronica and I have
are a manifestation

375
00:23:29,008 --> 00:23:31,101
of a subconscious desire
to break up,

376
00:23:31,177 --> 00:23:33,611
to pursue a meaningful relationship
with Caitlin.

377
00:23:33,679 --> 00:23:36,375
- Caitlin's on the same wavelength?
- It's safe to say yes.

378
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:39,543
- I think all four of you better talk it over.
- All four?

379
00:23:39,619 --> 00:23:43,885
You, Veronica, Caitlin
and Caitlin's fianc.

380
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:56,898
- Do you sell video tapes?
- Yeah. What are you looking for?

381
00:23:56,969 --> 00:24:00,064
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.
- Uh, one second.

382
00:24:00,139 --> 00:24:03,575
I'm on with the distribution house.
Let me make sure they got it.

383
00:24:03,643 --> 00:24:06,373
- What's it called again?
- Happy Scrappy Hero Pup.

384
00:24:06,445 --> 00:24:08,436
- [Child] Happy Scrappy...
- She loves it.

385
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:09,640
Obviously.

386
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:14,746
This is RST Video calling.
Customer number 4352.

387
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:17,084
I'd like to place an order.

388
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,420
I need one each of the following tapes:

389
00:24:19,492 --> 00:24:21,585
Whispers In The Wind,
To Each His Own,

390
00:24:21,662 --> 00:24:24,858
Put It Where It Doesn't Belong,
My Pipes Need Cleaning,

391
00:24:24,931 --> 00:24:28,196
All Tit Fucking Volume Eight,
I Need Your Cock,

392
00:24:28,267 --> 00:24:31,703
Ass Worshipping Rim Jobbers,
My Cunt And Eight Shafts,

393
00:24:31,771 --> 00:24:36,071
Cum Clean, Cum Gargling Naked Sluts,
Cum Buns III,

394
00:24:36,142 --> 00:24:38,975
Cumming In Socks,
Cum On Ilene,

395
00:24:39,046 --> 00:24:41,172
Huge Black Cocks
with Pearly White Cum,

396
00:24:41,247 --> 00:24:44,046
Girls Who Crave Cock,
Girls Who Crave Cunt,

397
00:24:44,116 --> 00:24:47,813
Men Alone Il: The KY Connection,
Pink Pussy Lips,

398
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:50,981
oh, yeah, and
All Holes Filled with Hard Cock.

399
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:55,084
Yup. Oh, wait a minute.
What was that called again?

400
00:24:55,161 --> 00:24:56,685
# I'm a needle, you know

401
00:24:56,762 --> 00:25:01,324
# Never want to be a haystack

402
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,666
# Don't ever want to break
Your heart in two

403
00:25:04,737 --> 00:25:08,332
# Know the crowd
Is gonna sell their soul

404
00:25:08,407 --> 00:25:11,501
# Take it anywhere I know
Well, I promise you

405
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:13,704
# It's making me sick #

406
00:25:15,715 --> 00:25:18,617
Yes, I'd like to check on
a misprint in today's edition.

407
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:20,845
Today's edition.

408
00:25:20,921 --> 00:25:24,686
It says,
"Bree to wed Asian design major."

409
00:25:24,757 --> 00:25:26,691
No, everything's spelled fine.

410
00:25:26,759 --> 00:25:29,956
I was just wondering
if the article was a misprint.

411
00:25:30,029 --> 00:25:32,725
I don't know,
a typographical error or something.

412
00:25:32,798 --> 00:25:37,565
Maybe it should say, "Caitlin Bray"
or "Caitlin Bre" with one "e."

413
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:42,473
I'm a curious party.
A curious party.

414
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,338
I'm an ex- boyfriend, and...

415
00:25:44,411 --> 00:25:47,811
I talk to her all the time and
she never mentioned this engagement.

416
00:25:47,880 --> 00:25:50,907
That's why I'm thinking
maybe it's a misprint.

417
00:25:52,518 --> 00:25:57,512
Are you sure? Maybe there's
a vindictive printer working for you.

418
00:25:57,590 --> 00:26:01,651
Meaning like, someone who asked her out
once and got shot down,

419
00:26:01,727 --> 00:26:06,256
and this is his revenge by putting
this bogus article in the paper.

420
00:26:06,332 --> 00:26:08,766
Hello. Hello?

421
00:26:15,408 --> 00:26:17,808
- [Sniffing]
- [Cat meows]

422
00:26:17,878 --> 00:26:21,678
I don't care if she's my cousin, I'm
gonna knock those boots again tonight.

423
00:26:21,748 --> 00:26:25,274
- Look. The fuckin' human vacuum.
- Scumbag, what are you doing?

424
00:26:25,352 --> 00:26:28,344
- Hanging with Silent Bob and his cousin.
- He's your cousin?

425
00:26:28,422 --> 00:26:30,514
- He's from Russia too.
- No way.

426
00:26:30,589 --> 00:26:34,457
- What part of Russia?
- Do I look like his fuckin' biographer?

427
00:26:34,527 --> 00:26:38,793
- Olaf, what part of Russia are you from?
- Moscow.

428
00:26:38,865 --> 00:26:42,800
- He only speaks Russian?
- He speaks some English, but not good.

429
00:26:42,868 --> 00:26:45,962
- Is he staying here?
- He's moving to the big city this week.

430
00:26:46,038 --> 00:26:48,303
- He wants to be a metal singer.
- [Girl] No way.

431
00:26:48,375 --> 00:26:50,968
I swear. Olaf, metal.

432
00:26:51,043 --> 00:26:54,809
That's his fucking metal face.
Olaf, girl nice?

433
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:57,543
- [Speaks Russian]
- That's fucked up, man.

434
00:26:57,617 --> 00:27:00,983
- What did he say?
- I don't know, but this guy's a character.

435
00:27:01,054 --> 00:27:04,147
- He really wants to play metal?
- He's got his own band in Moscow.

436
00:27:04,223 --> 00:27:07,819
- Called "Fuck Your Yankee Blue Jeans".
- That doesn't sound metal.

437
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:11,158
You gotta hear him sing.
Olaf, "Berserker."

438
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:14,996
- Come on, man, "Berserker"!
- Does he sing in English or Russian?

439
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:18,127
In English. Come on, "Berserker."
Girls think sexy.

440
00:27:19,572 --> 00:27:23,236
- Aah. Aah.
- Watch, he's gonna sing it. It's too funny.

441
00:27:23,310 --> 00:27:27,905
# My love for you
Is like a truck, berserker

442
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:32,178
# Would you like
Some making fuck, berserker #

443
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:35,414
- That's fuckin' funny, man.
- Did he say, "making fuck"?

444
00:27:35,488 --> 00:27:39,425
[Science fiction movie sounds]

445
00:27:39,493 --> 00:27:41,221
[Man screaming]

446
00:27:41,293 --> 00:27:42,885
[Sounds stop]

447
00:27:56,042 --> 00:28:00,536
# My love for you
Is ticking clock, berserker

448
00:28:00,613 --> 00:28:05,550
# Would you like
To suck my cock, berserker #

449
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:08,918
That's beautiful, man.

450
00:28:12,258 --> 00:28:15,159
Hold on to the counter
and I'll pull.

451
00:28:15,227 --> 00:28:18,321
Usually I just turn the can upside down.

452
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,832
Maybe we oughta soap your hand up.

453
00:28:20,901 --> 00:28:24,166
They ought to put a warning on these,
like with cigarettes.

454
00:28:24,237 --> 00:28:26,067
I think it's coming!

455
00:28:29,074 --> 00:28:32,510
Thanks. I thought I was going
to have to go to the hospital.

456
00:28:32,579 --> 00:28:35,275
I'll throw this out
as a precautionary measure.

457
00:28:35,348 --> 00:28:37,611
[Chuckling]
Stings a little.

458
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:41,848
A word of advice. Sometimes you
got to let those hard-to-reach chips go.

459
00:28:41,922 --> 00:28:43,947
- [Door opens]
- Thanks.

460
00:28:45,692 --> 00:28:48,786
That article's accurate.
Caitlin really is getting married.

461
00:28:48,861 --> 00:28:52,126
- Know what I just watched?
- Me pulling a can off some moron's fist?

462
00:28:52,198 --> 00:28:53,564
Return Of The Jedi.

463
00:28:53,633 --> 00:28:56,898
Didn't you hear me?
Caitlin is really getting married.

464
00:28:56,970 --> 00:29:00,735
What did you like better?
Jedi or The Empire Strikes Back?

465
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,832
- Empire.
- Blasphemy.

466
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:05,811
Empire had the better ending.

467
00:29:05,878 --> 00:29:09,314
Luke gets his hand cut off,
finds out Vader's his father.

468
00:29:09,382 --> 00:29:12,817
Han gets frozen, taken away by Boba Fett.
It ends on such a down note.

469
00:29:12,886 --> 00:29:16,321
I mean, that's what life is
a series of down endings.

470
00:29:16,389 --> 00:29:18,789
All Jedi had was a bunch of muppets.

471
00:29:18,859 --> 00:29:22,317
There was something else going on
in Jedi. I never noticed it 'til today.

472
00:29:22,395 --> 00:29:24,386
They build another Death Star, right?

473
00:29:24,463 --> 00:29:27,830
The first one was fully operational
before the rebels destroyed it.

474
00:29:27,900 --> 00:29:29,994
Luke blew it up. Give credit.

475
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,402
The second one was being built
when they blew it up.

476
00:29:32,472 --> 00:29:34,098
Compliments of Lando Calrissian.

477
00:29:34,173 --> 00:29:36,768
Something never sat right with me
that second time.

478
00:29:36,842 --> 00:29:39,607
I couldn't put my finger on it.
Something wasn't right.

479
00:29:39,679 --> 00:29:40,872
And you figured it out.

480
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,540
The first Death Star
was manned by the lmperial Army.

481
00:29:43,616 --> 00:29:47,178
The only people on board were Storm
Troopers, dignitaries, lmperialists.

482
00:29:47,254 --> 00:29:48,277
Basically.

483
00:29:48,355 --> 00:29:51,051
So when they blew it up, no problem.
Evil's punished.

484
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:54,787
- And the second time around?
- It wasn't even done being built yet.

485
00:29:54,861 --> 00:29:57,124
- It was still under construction.
- So?

486
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,563
A job of that magnitude would require

487
00:29:59,633 --> 00:30:02,659
a lot more manpower
than the lmperial Army had to offer.

488
00:30:02,735 --> 00:30:05,466
I'll bet they brought
independent contractors in.

489
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:08,301
- Plumbers, roofers...
- Not just lmperialists.

490
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:11,435
- Is that what you're getting at?
- To get it built quickly,

491
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,536
they'd hire anybody
that could do the job.

492
00:30:13,613 --> 00:30:16,377
Think the average Storm Trooper
can install a toilet main?

493
00:30:16,449 --> 00:30:20,976
- All they know is killing.
- So they bring in independent contractors.

494
00:30:21,053 --> 00:30:25,991
- Why are you so upset.
- All those contractors brought in are killed.

495
00:30:26,058 --> 00:30:28,822
Casualties of a war
they had nothing to do with.

496
00:30:28,894 --> 00:30:33,092
Look, you're a roofer. Some juicy
government contract comes your way.

497
00:30:33,165 --> 00:30:35,999
You got a wife and kids,
the two-story in suburbia.

498
00:30:36,069 --> 00:30:39,163
This is a government contract
which means all sorts of benefits.

499
00:30:39,239 --> 00:30:43,436
Along come these militants who blast
everything within a three-mile radius.

500
00:30:43,509 --> 00:30:46,034
You didn't ask for that.
You had no personal politics.

501
00:30:46,111 --> 00:30:49,171
- You're trying to scrape out a living.
- I don't mean to interrupt,

502
00:30:49,248 --> 00:30:52,184
- what are you talking about?
- The ending of Return Of The Jedi.

503
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,583
He's trying to convince me

504
00:30:53,653 --> 00:30:56,952
that any independent contractors
working on the Death Star

505
00:30:57,022 --> 00:30:59,616
were innocent victims
when it was destroyed.

506
00:30:59,692 --> 00:31:02,355
I'm a contractor myself.
I'm a roofer.

507
00:31:02,429 --> 00:31:04,363
"Done And Ready Home lmprovements."

508
00:31:04,431 --> 00:31:07,696
Speaking as a roofer, I can tell you
a roofer's personal politics

509
00:31:07,767 --> 00:31:10,861
- comes into play when choosing jobs.
- Like when?

510
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:14,373
Three weeks ago, I was offered a job
up in the hills. Beautiful house.

511
00:31:14,441 --> 00:31:17,376
Tons of property.
A simple re-shingling job.

512
00:31:17,443 --> 00:31:21,039
They told me if I could finish it
in one day, I would double my price.

513
00:31:21,114 --> 00:31:23,843
- Then I realized whose house it was.
- [Dante] Whose was it?

514
00:31:23,916 --> 00:31:27,876
- Dominic Bambino's.
- Babyface Bambino? The gangster?

515
00:31:27,954 --> 00:31:31,890
The same! The money was right,
but the risk was too high.

516
00:31:31,957 --> 00:31:35,985
I knew who he was, and based on that,
I turned the job over to a friend.

517
00:31:36,062 --> 00:31:38,656
- Based on personal politics.
- Right!

518
00:31:38,732 --> 00:31:42,998
The next week, the Foresci family
put a hit on Babyface's house.

519
00:31:43,069 --> 00:31:46,436
My friend was shot and killed.
Didn't even finish re-shingling.

520
00:31:46,506 --> 00:31:47,666
No way.

521
00:31:47,741 --> 00:31:51,767
[Man] I'm alive because I knew the risk
involved in that particular client.

522
00:31:51,845 --> 00:31:53,778
My friend wasn't so lucky.

523
00:31:53,847 --> 00:31:57,908
Any contractor working on that
Death Star knew the risk involved.

524
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,578
If they got killed,
it's their own fault.

525
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:03,679
A roofer listens to this,
not his wallet.

526
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:18,198
They say so much, but they never
tell you if it's any good.

527
00:32:21,274 --> 00:32:24,539
Are either one of these any good?

528
00:32:24,611 --> 00:32:26,545
- Sir?
- What?

529
00:32:26,613 --> 00:32:30,379
- Are either one of these any good?
- I don't watch movies.

530
00:32:30,450 --> 00:32:33,816
[Sighs] Well, have you heard anything
about either one of them?

531
00:32:33,886 --> 00:32:37,151
I find it's best to stay out
of other people's affairs.

532
00:32:37,222 --> 00:32:41,159
You mean you haven't heard anybody
say anything about either one of these?

533
00:32:41,227 --> 00:32:43,161
Nope.

534
00:32:43,228 --> 00:32:45,163
[Sighs]

535
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:50,667
- Well, what about these two?
- They suck.

536
00:32:50,737 --> 00:32:54,173
[Sighs]
These are the same two movies.

537
00:32:54,239 --> 00:32:57,698
- You weren't paying any attention.
- No, I wasn't.

538
00:32:57,777 --> 00:33:00,041
I don't think your manager
would appreciate...

539
00:33:00,113 --> 00:33:03,344
- I don't appreciate your ruse, ma'am.
- I beg your pardon?

540
00:33:03,416 --> 00:33:07,010
Your ruse.
Your cunning attempt to trick me.

541
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:11,352
I was only pointing out that
you weren't paying any attention.

542
00:33:11,423 --> 00:33:13,358
And I hope it feels good.

543
00:33:13,426 --> 00:33:16,657
- You hope what feels good?
- I hope it feels so good to be right.

544
00:33:16,729 --> 00:33:19,061
Nothing's more exhilarating
than pointing out

545
00:33:19,132 --> 00:33:21,032
the shortcomings of others, is there?

546
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:24,366
[Heavy sigh] Well, this is
the last time I rent here!

547
00:33:24,437 --> 00:33:27,702
- You will be missed.
- Screw you!

548
00:33:29,876 --> 00:33:34,313
- You're not allowed to rent here anymore!
- [Jay] Yeah!

549
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:36,314
Screw me?

550
00:33:49,229 --> 00:33:51,857
You'll never believe what this
unruly customer said.

551
00:33:51,931 --> 00:33:53,421
- Wait.
- She in here?

552
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,593
This guy's going through all the eggs.

553
00:33:55,668 --> 00:33:57,966
This has been going on
for 20 minutes now.

554
00:33:58,037 --> 00:34:00,938
- What's he looking for?
- Said he has to find the perfect dozen.

555
00:34:01,007 --> 00:34:03,840
- Perfect dozen?
- Each egg has to be perfect.

556
00:34:03,910 --> 00:34:06,174
- The quest isn't going well?
- Obviously not.

557
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:09,613
- Look at the cartons that didn't make it.
- Why doesn't he mix and match?

558
00:34:09,682 --> 00:34:12,173
- I told him that, and he yelled at me.
- What'd he say?

559
00:34:12,252 --> 00:34:15,517
He said it's important to have standards.
No one has pride anymore.

560
00:34:15,587 --> 00:34:17,817
It's not like
you laid the eggs yourself.

561
00:34:17,891 --> 00:34:20,860
I give him five more minutes.
After that, I'm calling the cops.

562
00:34:20,927 --> 00:34:23,919
I don't need this.
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

563
00:34:25,265 --> 00:34:27,199
Two packs of cigarettes.

564
00:34:29,936 --> 00:34:33,463
- I'm as puzzled as you.
- I've actually seen it before.

565
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:36,304
- You know him?
- No, but I know the behavior.

566
00:34:36,376 --> 00:34:38,503
He's looking for the perfect
carton of eggs?

567
00:34:38,578 --> 00:34:39,806
[Randal] How'd you know?

568
00:34:39,879 --> 00:34:43,645
- I'll bet you he's a guidance counselor.
- [Dante] Why do you say that?

569
00:34:43,716 --> 00:34:47,743
I saw it happen in Food City, last year.
Different guy, though.

570
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:50,653
Stock boy said he looked through
cartons for half an hour,

571
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:52,816
doing all sorts
of endurance tests and stuff.

572
00:34:52,892 --> 00:34:56,225
I asked him why nobody ever called
the manager, and he said it happens...

573
00:34:56,296 --> 00:34:58,196
two, three times a week, sometimes more.

574
00:34:58,264 --> 00:35:00,494
- Get out of here.
- No, I kid you not.

575
00:35:00,567 --> 00:35:03,968
They call it shell shock. Seems to
only happen with guidance counselors.

576
00:35:04,037 --> 00:35:06,767
They used to make a big deal of it.
They just let it go now.

577
00:35:06,839 --> 00:35:10,002
They always pay for whatever they break.
They never bother anybody.

578
00:35:10,076 --> 00:35:11,635
Why guidance counselors?

579
00:35:11,711 --> 00:35:15,010
If your job was as meaningless
as theirs, wouldn't you go crazy too?

580
00:35:15,081 --> 00:35:18,574
- My guidance counselor was worthless.
- See?

581
00:35:18,651 --> 00:35:21,085
It's important to have a job
that makes a difference.

582
00:35:21,154 --> 00:35:26,353
That's why I manually masturbate caged
animals for artificial insemination.

583
00:35:28,928 --> 00:35:31,863
# Go your own way

584
00:35:31,931 --> 00:35:37,130
# You can call it
Another lonely day #

585
00:36:00,893 --> 00:36:04,659
Did you ever notice
that all the prices end in "9"?

586
00:36:04,731 --> 00:36:06,665
Damn, that's eerie.

587
00:36:06,733 --> 00:36:09,531
Know how much the average
jiz-mopper makes per hour?

588
00:36:09,602 --> 00:36:10,660
What's a jiz-mopper?

589
00:36:10,737 --> 00:36:14,002
The guy that cleans up the nudie booths
after each guy jerks off.

590
00:36:14,073 --> 00:36:16,166
- "Nudie booth"?
- Yeah, nudie booth.

591
00:36:16,242 --> 00:36:18,837
- You ever been in a nudie booth?
- Guess not.

592
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:20,105
Oh, man, it's great.

593
00:36:20,179 --> 00:36:23,342
You go into a booth, and there's
glass between you and these chicks.

594
00:36:23,416 --> 00:36:26,682
- They put on a show for you for ten bucks.
- What kind of a show?

595
00:36:26,753 --> 00:36:29,847
Think of the weirdest, craziest shit
you'd like to see chicks do.

596
00:36:29,922 --> 00:36:33,620
These chicks do it all. They insert
things into any opening on their body.

597
00:36:33,694 --> 00:36:36,127
- Any opening.
- Can we not talk about this now?

598
00:36:36,196 --> 00:36:39,289
The jiz-mopper's job is to clean it up
after each guy shoots a load.

599
00:36:39,365 --> 00:36:41,424
Everybody does it right on the window.

600
00:36:41,501 --> 00:36:44,732
I don't know if you know this,
cum leaves streaks if you don't clean it.

601
00:36:44,804 --> 00:36:47,830
- I will never come to this place again.
- Excuse me?

602
00:36:47,907 --> 00:36:51,775
Using filthy language in front of
the customers. You both should be fired.

603
00:36:51,844 --> 00:36:55,371
Oh, I'm sorry.
I guess we kinda got carried away.

604
00:36:55,448 --> 00:36:58,474
I don't know
if sorry can make up for it.

605
00:36:58,551 --> 00:37:01,350
You've highly offended me.

606
00:37:01,422 --> 00:37:04,481
Well, if you think that's offensive,
check this out.

607
00:37:04,557 --> 00:37:06,422
Oh!
[Screaming]

608
00:37:06,492 --> 00:37:09,223
- You can see her kidneys.
- Why do you do things like that?

609
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:12,163
- You know he's going tell the boss.
- Who cares?

610
00:37:12,231 --> 00:37:15,166
He's an asshole. Everybody
that comes in is way too uptight.

611
00:37:15,234 --> 00:37:18,170
This job would be great
if it wasn't for the fucking customers.

612
00:37:18,237 --> 00:37:21,503
- I'm gonna hear from the boss tomorrow.
- Would you loosen up?

613
00:37:21,575 --> 00:37:24,669
You'd feel better if you'd
rip into the occasional customer.

614
00:37:24,744 --> 00:37:27,680
Why? I don't bother them
and they don't bother me.

615
00:37:27,747 --> 00:37:32,446
Liar! Tell me there aren't customers that
annoy the piss out of you on a daily basis.

616
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:35,113
- There aren't!
- How can you lie like that?

617
00:37:35,188 --> 00:37:40,785
Why don't you vent? Vent your
frustrations. Who pisses you off?

618
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:44,296
Well, I guess it isn't
customers in particular.

619
00:37:44,364 --> 00:37:47,128
Maybe just a group of customers.

620
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:51,500
- Well, let's hear it.
- Well, the Milk Maids.

621
00:37:51,571 --> 00:37:53,505
The Milk Maids?

622
00:37:53,574 --> 00:37:57,475
The women that go through every gallon
of milk, looking for that later date,

623
00:37:57,544 --> 00:38:00,637
as if somewhere beyond all the
gallons is a container of milk...

624
00:38:00,713 --> 00:38:03,409
that won't go bad for like a decade.

625
00:38:03,483 --> 00:38:07,648
You know who I can do without?
The people in the video store.

626
00:38:07,721 --> 00:38:09,847
- Which ones?
- All of 'em.

627
00:38:09,923 --> 00:38:13,619
What would you get for a six-year-old
boy who chronically wets his bed?

628
00:38:13,693 --> 00:38:16,491
So, do you have any new movies in?

629
00:38:16,562 --> 00:38:21,227
Do you have that one with that guy who
was in that movie that was out last year?

630
00:38:21,301 --> 00:38:23,234
They never rent quality flicks.

631
00:38:23,302 --> 00:38:26,500
They always pick the most intellectually
devoid movie on the racks.

632
00:38:26,573 --> 00:38:29,098
Oooh! Navy SEALS!

633
00:38:29,176 --> 00:38:32,667
In order to join they have to have an I.Q.
Less than their shoe size.

634
00:38:32,745 --> 00:38:36,773
You think you get stupid questions?
You should hear the barrage that I get.

635
00:38:36,850 --> 00:38:39,317
There's no ice?
I've got to drink this coffee hot?

636
00:38:39,385 --> 00:38:42,786
So, how much is this thing anyway?

637
00:38:45,024 --> 00:38:47,720
Do you sell hubcaps
for a '72 Pinto hatchback?

638
00:38:47,794 --> 00:38:49,728
Ooh! Mini-Trucker magazine.

639
00:38:49,796 --> 00:38:52,788
- See? You vented. Don't you feel better?
- No.

640
00:38:52,865 --> 00:38:55,959
- Why not?
- My ex-girlfriend is getting married.

641
00:38:56,035 --> 00:38:59,436
You got a one-track mind.
It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin.

642
00:38:59,505 --> 00:39:01,440
Veronica!

643
00:39:03,377 --> 00:39:06,641
- What happened to home by 12:00?
- Boss hasn't shown up yet.

644
00:39:06,713 --> 00:39:09,146
- How come you're not in class?
- Got canceled.

645
00:39:09,215 --> 00:39:12,651
- So I brought you some lunch.
- What is it?

646
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:15,812
Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts
cut off. What do you think?

647
00:39:15,888 --> 00:39:18,653
- It's lasagna.
- Really?

648
00:39:18,725 --> 00:39:21,158
Oh, you're the queen.

649
00:39:21,228 --> 00:39:24,163
I'm glad you calmed down a bit.
Hi, Randal.

650
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:27,165
- Thirty-seven?
- Shut up!

651
00:39:27,234 --> 00:39:30,669
Yes, I've calmed down.
I'm not happy, but I'll be able to deal.

652
00:39:30,737 --> 00:39:32,500
[Sucking sound]

653
00:39:32,573 --> 00:39:34,938
Why don't you go back
to the video store?

654
00:39:39,346 --> 00:39:42,941
- You had to tell him?
- I had to. He put it into perspective.

655
00:39:43,016 --> 00:39:45,950
- What did he say?
- He said at least he wasn't 36.

656
00:39:46,018 --> 00:39:47,952
And that made you feel better?

657
00:39:48,021 --> 00:39:51,457
And he said most of them were college
guys I never even seen or met before.

658
00:39:51,525 --> 00:39:54,619
- The ostrich syndrome: If you don't see it...
- It isn't there. Yes.

659
00:39:54,695 --> 00:39:57,959
- Thank you for being rational.
- Thank you for the lasagna.

660
00:39:58,030 --> 00:39:59,895
- Couldn't get the shutters open?
- No.

661
00:39:59,966 --> 00:40:03,300
I called the locksmith. The earliest
he can be here is tomorrow morning.

662
00:40:03,370 --> 00:40:05,964
Bummer. Well, I gotta
head back for the 1:30 class.

663
00:40:06,039 --> 00:40:10,066
- What time you get finished?
- 8:00. I have a sorority meeting 'til 9:00.

664
00:40:10,142 --> 00:40:12,805
I'll see you when you close.
Can we go out for coffee?

665
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,814
- Sure.
- Good.

666
00:40:14,881 --> 00:40:17,146
See you when you close.
Enjoy the lasagna.

667
00:40:17,217 --> 00:40:20,653
[Door opens, closes]

668
00:40:25,224 --> 00:40:28,353
[Sucking sound]

669
00:40:34,467 --> 00:40:36,401
Vermont?

670
00:40:36,470 --> 00:40:39,633
No, that can't be.
I just talked to him this morning.

671
00:40:39,706 --> 00:40:42,402
He left at what time?

672
00:40:42,476 --> 00:40:46,742
He really went to Vermont? When
the hell was someone going to tell me?

673
00:40:46,813 --> 00:40:49,576
He promised me he'd be here by noon!

674
00:40:49,649 --> 00:40:53,915
Jesus, when does he get back? Tuesday?
You've gotta be fucking kidding me!

675
00:40:53,986 --> 00:40:56,421
I've got a game at 2:00,
the shutters are jammed.

676
00:40:56,489 --> 00:41:00,256
And he's in Vermont?
I'm not even supposed to be here today!

677
00:41:00,327 --> 00:41:02,760
[Sighing]

678
00:41:03,830 --> 00:41:06,195
So I'm stuck here until closing?

679
00:41:06,265 --> 00:41:10,259
Oh, this is just great.
I can't fucking believe this.

680
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:16,877
No. No, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to yell at you.

681
00:41:16,877 --> 00:41:19,310
Yeah, I know.

682
00:41:19,380 --> 00:41:22,975
No, I'll be all right.

683
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:25,813
Well, that's all I can do, right?
Yeah.

684
00:41:25,885 --> 00:41:28,820
- All right, thanks. Bye.
- Vermont?

685
00:41:28,889 --> 00:41:31,914
- Can you fucking believe this?
- He didn't mention that to you?

686
00:41:31,991 --> 00:41:34,755
Not a word!
Not a fucking word, that slippery shit.

687
00:41:34,828 --> 00:41:37,093
- So, what? You're stuck here all day?
- Fuck!

688
00:41:37,163 --> 00:41:39,097
- Why'd you apologize?
- What?

689
00:41:39,166 --> 00:41:41,930
I heard you. Why?
You had every reason to be mad.

690
00:41:42,002 --> 00:41:45,096
- I know!
- That seems to be the leitmotif in your life.

691
00:41:45,172 --> 00:41:47,264
- Ever backing down.
- I don't back down!

692
00:41:47,341 --> 00:41:49,934
You always back down.
You assume blame that's not yours.

693
00:41:50,009 --> 00:41:52,773
You come in on your day off.
You buckle like a belt.

694
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:55,782
- Know what pisses me off?
- That I'm right about your buckling?

695
00:41:55,850 --> 00:41:58,443
- I'm going to miss the game!
- Because you buckled.

696
00:41:58,518 --> 00:42:01,784
- Shut up with that shit. It ain't helping!
- Don't yell at me, pal.

697
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:04,120
- I'm sorry.
- See? There you go again.

698
00:42:04,191 --> 00:42:08,059
- I can't believe I'm going to miss the game.
- At least we're stuck here together.

699
00:42:08,128 --> 00:42:10,461
You got a customer.

700
00:42:10,530 --> 00:42:13,124
What?
What do you want?

701
00:42:17,037 --> 00:42:20,131
I can't fucking believe this.

702
00:42:20,207 --> 00:42:23,300
Yeah, hello, Sanford.
Dante.

703
00:42:23,376 --> 00:42:27,313
I can't play today.
I'm stuck at work.

704
00:42:27,381 --> 00:42:31,316
Yeah, I know I'm not scheduled today...
Forget it.

705
00:42:31,385 --> 00:42:36,084
Point is, I can't play today.
Neither can Randal. He's working too.

706
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:41,291
Wait a second.
Do we have to play at the park?

707
00:42:41,362 --> 00:42:44,091
Hold on.
You feeling limber?

708
00:42:54,542 --> 00:42:57,443
- Pull my laces tighter, man.
- I've got to tell you,

709
00:42:57,511 --> 00:42:59,945
this is one of the ballsiest moves
I've been privy to.

710
00:43:00,014 --> 00:43:02,948
I never thought you capable of such
a disregard of store policy.

711
00:43:03,017 --> 00:43:05,952
- I told him I had a game. It's his own fault.
- No arguments here.

712
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:09,114
- Insubordination rules.
- I just want to play hockey.

713
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:10,555
I'm gonna grab a Gatorade.

714
00:43:10,623 --> 00:43:12,615
If you grab one,
then everybody will.

715
00:43:12,693 --> 00:43:14,957
- So?
- Who's gonna pay for these Gatorades?

716
00:43:15,029 --> 00:43:17,964
- What do you care, motherfucker?
- I have a responsibility.

717
00:43:18,032 --> 00:43:20,966
- Everybody can't grab free drinks.
- What responsibility?

718
00:43:21,035 --> 00:43:23,970
- You're closing the store to play hockey.
- He's got a point.

719
00:43:24,038 --> 00:43:26,631
Will you let me maintain
some semblance of control?

720
00:43:26,706 --> 00:43:29,141
If you're gonna be insubordinate,
go the full nine,

721
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:31,143
not pussy out
when it comes to free shit.

722
00:43:31,212 --> 00:43:33,271
As if we're going to have a run
on Gatorade.

723
00:43:33,346 --> 00:43:35,907
- Fuckin' A.
- All right! Jesus, you fuckers are pushy!

724
00:43:35,983 --> 00:43:38,144
I hear Caitlin's marrying
an Asian drum major.

725
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,210
- Design major.
- Can we not talk about this?

726
00:43:40,286 --> 00:43:44,417
Fine, but you're living in denial
and suppressing rage, motherfucker.

727
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:47,255
- You gonna lock the store?
- You gonna lock the video store?

728
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:50,263
Look who you're asking here.
How're we gonna block the street?

729
00:43:50,331 --> 00:43:54,062
- We're not playing in the street.
- Then where are we gonna play?

730
00:44:00,207 --> 00:44:02,401
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em!

731
00:44:14,854 --> 00:44:18,290
[Yelling]

732
00:44:27,968 --> 00:44:30,960
I got it! I got it!
It's mine, it's mine!

733
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,081
Yeah!

734
00:44:43,183 --> 00:44:45,617
[Yelling continues]

735
00:44:50,658 --> 00:44:52,592
Hit 'em!

736
00:44:54,662 --> 00:44:56,823
All right, here we go.
I got it.

737
00:44:56,897 --> 00:44:59,092
- When is this period over?
- Eight minutes.

738
00:44:59,166 --> 00:45:01,929
What, are you shitting me?
I wanna get cigarettes.

739
00:45:02,002 --> 00:45:05,437
- Just wait a few minutes.
- I'm gonna break my neck on this ladder.

740
00:45:05,506 --> 00:45:08,703
Lose the skates, Dorothy Hamill,
and open the fucking store!

741
00:45:08,776 --> 00:45:10,209
- Where are you?
- He's busy!

742
00:45:10,277 --> 00:45:11,266
- In a second!

743
00:45:11,344 --> 00:45:15,111
Fuck "in a second"!
Oh, look at you. You can't even pass.

744
00:45:15,182 --> 00:45:18,276
- [Dante] I can pass!
- How about covering the point? You suck!

745
00:45:18,352 --> 00:45:21,788
- Who are you to make assessments?
- I'll assess all I want, pal!

746
00:45:21,855 --> 00:45:25,621
- Dante, you in or out?
- Don't pass to this guy. He sucks.

747
00:45:25,693 --> 00:45:28,286
- You're any better?
- I can whip your ass any day.

748
00:45:28,362 --> 00:45:31,297
- Easy to say over there.
- Give me a stick, pretty boy!

749
00:45:31,365 --> 00:45:34,528
I'll knock your fucking teeth out
and pass all over your ass!

750
00:45:34,601 --> 00:45:36,432
- You open?
- Yeah, you open?

751
00:45:36,537 --> 00:45:39,802
- No!
- No!

752
00:45:39,873 --> 00:45:42,501
There's a stick.
You're shooting up against this goal.

753
00:45:42,576 --> 00:45:44,908
Hey, Redding! Come on.
Get this fucker!

754
00:45:57,558 --> 00:45:59,150
Oh, man! Hey!

755
00:45:59,226 --> 00:46:02,218
Come on. Let's go, let's go!
Come on, come on. Get him!

756
00:46:02,296 --> 00:46:04,287
Come on. Get him, get him!

757
00:46:18,011 --> 00:46:21,276
- Give me another ball.
- There are no more.

758
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:23,942
What are you talking about?
How many balls you bring?

759
00:46:24,017 --> 00:46:27,612
I brought the orange one
and... the orange one.

760
00:46:28,155 --> 00:46:30,055
Hey, any balls down there?

761
00:46:30,124 --> 00:46:34,060
[Jay] About the biggest pair
you ever seen, dingleberry.

762
00:46:34,128 --> 00:46:37,325
- You only brought one?
- I thought Redding brought all the balls.

763
00:46:37,398 --> 00:46:40,231
- [Redding] Dante had the balls.
- Nobody has another ball?

764
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:41,767
Shit!

765
00:46:41,835 --> 00:46:46,568
We got what, 12 minutes of a game
and it's over? Fuck!

766
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:50,406
Fuck, fuck, fuck!
I'm not even supposed to be here today.

767
00:46:52,312 --> 00:46:55,179
I still get free Gatorade, right?

768
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:09,087
- Be careful.
- I'm trying.

769
00:47:09,163 --> 00:47:13,100
You know, the insides of those has
got stuff that can give you cancer.

770
00:47:13,167 --> 00:47:15,602
- So I'm told.
- Yeah.

771
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:19,435
I had a friend that chewed glass
for a living. In the circus.

772
00:47:19,506 --> 00:47:22,942
And he got cancer
from chewing fluorescent bulb glass?

773
00:47:23,010 --> 00:47:26,776
- Got hit by a bus.
- Oh. Can I help you?

774
00:47:28,849 --> 00:47:33,549
Well, uh, that depends.
You got maybe a toilet in here?

775
00:47:33,621 --> 00:47:36,714
- Yeah, but it's for employees only.
- I understand.

776
00:47:36,790 --> 00:47:40,226
But I, uh, thought maybe
you'd let me use it anyway.

777
00:47:40,294 --> 00:47:44,560
I'm not so young anymore and I'm,
how do you say, a little incontinent.

778
00:47:44,631 --> 00:47:48,727
- Sure. In the back, through the cooler.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

779
00:47:58,812 --> 00:48:02,680
Say, uh, what kind of toilet paper
you got back there?

780
00:48:02,750 --> 00:48:05,912
- The white kind.
- I didn't ask about the color.

781
00:48:05,986 --> 00:48:09,581
I mean, is it rough
or is it cottony?

782
00:48:09,656 --> 00:48:12,489
- Actually, it's kinda rough.
- Oh, boy!

783
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:15,926
It's gonna knock the hell
out of my hemorrhoids.

784
00:48:15,996 --> 00:48:19,261
I thought maybe you could
let me have a roll of the soft stuff.

785
00:48:19,333 --> 00:48:21,927
I see you sell
the soft stuff back there.

786
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:24,767
- Yeah, but...
- Come on, boitshik! What's the difference?

787
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:28,172
You said yourself
you have the rough stuff in the back.

788
00:48:28,242 --> 00:48:30,938
- Yeah, sure. Go ahead.
- Thank you, sonny boy.

789
00:48:31,011 --> 00:48:32,945
You're a lifesaver.

790
00:48:41,622 --> 00:48:44,216
Say, young fella,
I hate to bother you again,

791
00:48:44,291 --> 00:48:47,887
but, uh, maybe I could have something
in the back there to read?

792
00:48:47,961 --> 00:48:49,896
A paper or something?

793
00:48:49,963 --> 00:48:52,227
Sometimes it takes me a while,

794
00:48:52,300 --> 00:48:55,097
and I like to have something
to read while it's going on.

795
00:48:55,169 --> 00:48:57,103
[Dante] Yeah, sure, go ahead.

796
00:48:57,170 --> 00:49:00,401
[Man] One of the magazines you got
in the back behind the counter.

797
00:49:00,474 --> 00:49:03,739
- The porno mags?
- Yeah!

798
00:49:03,810 --> 00:49:06,245
I like the cartoons.
They make me laugh.

799
00:49:06,313 --> 00:49:09,749
They draw some of the biggest titties
you ever saw.

800
00:49:09,816 --> 00:49:12,751
Not this one. Maybe the one
you got underneath this one.

801
00:49:12,820 --> 00:49:15,253
- They got bigger titties in there.
- Here.

802
00:49:15,323 --> 00:49:18,087
- Now leave me alone.
- Oh, thank you, sonny boy.

803
00:49:18,158 --> 00:49:20,092
I appreciate it.

804
00:49:23,764 --> 00:49:25,288
Hell of a game.

805
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:29,426
One ball? I close the store, they come
all the way here, for one ball?

806
00:49:29,503 --> 00:49:31,699
Hockey is hockey.
At least we got to play.

807
00:49:31,773 --> 00:49:34,707
Twelve minutes is not a game.
It's hardly even a warmup.

808
00:49:34,775 --> 00:49:39,372
- Bitch, bitch. Want something to drink?
- Yeah, a Gatorade.

809
00:49:39,447 --> 00:49:44,406
- Hey, what happened to all the Gatorade?
- Exactly. They drank it all.

810
00:49:44,484 --> 00:49:48,148
- [Randal] Know what Sanford told me?
- [Dante] I can't believe she's marrying.

811
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,779
- Julie Dwyer died.
- Yeah, right.

812
00:49:49,856 --> 00:49:51,950
- No, I'm serious.
- Oh, my God!

813
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:55,119
Sanford's brother dates her cousin.
He found out this morning.

814
00:49:55,195 --> 00:49:57,629
- How? When?
- Embolism in her brain. Yesterday.

815
00:49:57,698 --> 00:50:00,633
She was swimming in the pool
in the YMCA when it happened.

816
00:50:00,702 --> 00:50:04,535
- She died mid-backstroke.
- I haven't seen her in, like, two years.

817
00:50:04,605 --> 00:50:07,734
Correct me if I'm wrong, but wasn't she
one of the illustrious 12?

818
00:50:07,809 --> 00:50:11,471
- Yeah, number six.
- You've had sex with a dead person.

819
00:50:11,545 --> 00:50:14,208
- I'm gonna go to her wake.
- No, you're not. It's today.

820
00:50:14,348 --> 00:50:17,340
- [Dante] What?
- [Randal] The next show's at 4:00.

821
00:50:17,418 --> 00:50:20,716
- [Dante] What about tomorrow?
- [Randal] She's buried in the morning.

822
00:50:20,787 --> 00:50:23,221
- You gotta watch the store. I gotta go.
- Wait.

823
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,520
Has it occurred to you
I might be bereaved?

824
00:50:25,592 --> 00:50:26,719
You hardly knew her.

825
00:50:26,793 --> 00:50:29,194
True. Do you know how many people
will be there?

826
00:50:29,263 --> 00:50:32,232
- All her old classmates.
- This is beneath even you.

827
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:35,394
I'm not gonna miss what's probably
the social event of the season.

828
00:50:35,470 --> 00:50:38,734
- You hate people!
- But I love gatherings. Isn't it ironic?

829
00:50:38,806 --> 00:50:41,570
Stop being an asshole.
Someone's gotta watch the store.

830
00:50:41,643 --> 00:50:43,735
- If you go, I go.
- She meant nothing to you!

831
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:46,405
She meant nothing to you neither
'til I told you she died.

832
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:48,415
- I'm not taking you.
- I'm going with you.

833
00:50:48,483 --> 00:50:52,077
- I can't close the store.
- You just closed the store to play hockey.

834
00:50:52,152 --> 00:50:56,112
Which means I can't close it for another
hour just so we can both go to a wake.

835
00:50:56,724 --> 00:50:58,123
You were saying?

836
00:50:58,192 --> 00:51:02,094
Thanks for putting me in
such a tough spot. You're a good friend.

837
00:51:03,831 --> 00:51:07,096
- She was pretty young, huh?
- Twenty- two. Just like us.

838
00:51:07,168 --> 00:51:10,933
- Embolism in a pool.
- What an embarrassing way to die.

839
00:51:11,004 --> 00:51:13,496
That's nothing compared to
how my cousin Walter died.

840
00:51:13,573 --> 00:51:14,598
How did he die?

841
00:51:14,676 --> 00:51:17,769
- He broke his neck.
- That's embarrassing?

842
00:51:17,844 --> 00:51:20,609
He broke his neck
trying to suck his own dick.

843
00:51:20,682 --> 00:51:22,774
- Shut the hell up.
- I swear.

844
00:51:22,849 --> 00:51:24,783
- Stop it.
- Bible truth.

845
00:51:24,851 --> 00:51:29,117
- Oh, my God!
- Haven't you ever tried to suck your dick?

846
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:32,057
- No.
- Yeah, right. You're so repressed.

847
00:51:32,126 --> 00:51:35,720
- Because I never tried to suck my dick?
- No, because you won't admit to it.

848
00:51:35,796 --> 00:51:39,062
As if a guy's a fucking pervert
'cause he tries to go down on himself.

849
00:51:39,132 --> 00:51:41,896
You're as curious as the rest
of us, pal. You've tried it.

850
00:51:41,968 --> 00:51:44,904
- Who found him?
- My cousin? Mom found him.

851
00:51:44,972 --> 00:51:48,737
It was a mess. He was on his bed,
his legs doubled over himself.

852
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,743
Mom freaked out.

853
00:51:50,812 --> 00:51:53,406
# You know that you are
A shooting star #

854
00:51:53,481 --> 00:51:57,075
- Made it, huh? Dick in his mouth?
- Yeah.

855
00:51:57,150 --> 00:51:59,914
Balls resting on his lips.

856
00:51:59,986 --> 00:52:03,582
- Wow. He really made it.
- Yeah, but at what a price.

857
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:09,095
- I can never reach.
- Reach what?

858
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:11,597
- You know.
- What, your dick?

859
00:52:11,665 --> 00:52:15,762
Yeah. Like you said, I guess everybody
gets curious and tries it sometime.

860
00:52:15,837 --> 00:52:17,770
I never tried it.

861
00:52:20,007 --> 00:52:21,941
Fucking pervert.

862
00:52:23,978 --> 00:52:28,438
# Suddenly everyone loved
To hear him play his songs

863
00:52:28,516 --> 00:52:33,715
# Watch the world go by
Surprising it goes so fast

864
00:52:33,788 --> 00:52:38,724
# Johnny looked around him and said
Hey, I've made the big time at last #

865
00:52:40,795 --> 00:52:44,231
- I knew this was a bad idea.
- Listen to you.

866
00:52:44,297 --> 00:52:48,234
I can't help it. At least on the roof,
I could see if anybody wanted to go in.

867
00:52:48,302 --> 00:52:50,394
Nobody's there.
It's 4:00 on a Saturday.

868
00:52:50,470 --> 00:52:53,268
How many people ever come to the store
at 4:00 on a Saturday?

869
00:52:55,076 --> 00:52:57,010
Let me in!

870
00:53:14,327 --> 00:53:16,353
[Crashing sound, woman screaming]

871
00:53:22,836 --> 00:53:26,363
# Do you know your place

872
00:53:26,674 --> 00:53:29,438
# In the big charade

873
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:34,004
# Are you more than dead

874
00:53:34,182 --> 00:53:37,948
# Leaders and followers
Leaders and followers #

875
00:53:38,019 --> 00:53:40,385
- [door closes]
- I can't fucking believe you.

876
00:53:40,454 --> 00:53:42,388
I'm telling you, it wasn't my fault.

877
00:53:42,456 --> 00:53:46,187
- You knocked the casket over!
- I was leanin' on it. It was an accident.

878
00:53:46,260 --> 00:53:48,557
Like someone knocks a casket over
on purpose!

879
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:51,894
- So the casket fell over. Big deal.
- Her fucking body fell out!

880
00:53:51,965 --> 00:53:55,231
I put her back in it. It's not like
it matters if she breaks something.

881
00:53:55,303 --> 00:53:58,739
- Just go open the video store.
- [Jay] Open the video store!

882
00:53:58,805 --> 00:54:01,240
Shut the fuck up, junkie.

883
00:54:03,344 --> 00:54:07,144
- Would you just go open the video store?
- Yeah, you cock-smokin' clerk.

884
00:54:07,214 --> 00:54:10,184
How many times have I told you
not to deal in front of the store?

885
00:54:10,250 --> 00:54:12,082
I'm not.
What're you talking about?

886
00:54:12,153 --> 00:54:14,451
- Have you got anything, man?
- What you want?

887
00:54:17,158 --> 00:54:20,093
- Let me borrow your car.
- I don't want to talk to you.

888
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:23,597
- Fine. Just let me borrow your car.
- Why should I loan you my car?

889
00:54:23,663 --> 00:54:25,928
- I want to rent a movie.
- You want to rent a movie.

890
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:27,092
I want to rent a movie.

891
00:54:27,167 --> 00:54:28,601
- [Sighs]
- What's that for?

892
00:54:28,668 --> 00:54:32,298
- You work in a video store!
- I work in a shitty video store.

893
00:54:32,373 --> 00:54:36,605
I want to go to a good video store
so I can get a good movie.

894
00:54:37,778 --> 00:54:39,870
And a pack of cigarettes.

895
00:54:39,947 --> 00:54:42,939
- Cute cat. What's its name?
- Annoying customer.

896
00:54:43,017 --> 00:54:44,951
Fucking dickhead.

897
00:54:47,455 --> 00:54:50,389
Can you imagine being halfway decent
to the customers?

898
00:54:50,458 --> 00:54:52,892
- Let me borrow your car.
- May I be blunt with you?

899
00:54:52,959 --> 00:54:53,949
If you must.

900
00:54:54,028 --> 00:54:57,896
We are employees of Quick Stop
Convenience and RST Video, respectively.

901
00:54:57,964 --> 00:55:01,332
We have obligations that, although
they may seem cruel and unusual,

902
00:55:01,402 --> 00:55:04,235
- mean manning the store until closing.
- I see.

903
00:55:04,305 --> 00:55:07,900
So playing hockey and attending wakes
are standard operating procedures?

904
00:55:07,975 --> 00:55:12,412
Those are obligations that couldn't
have been met at any other date.

905
00:55:12,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Renting videos, that's gratuitous, and
illogical, since you work at a video store.

906
00:55:17,318 --> 00:55:19,252
- Are you open?
- Yes.

907
00:55:19,319 --> 00:55:21,015
I don't care for your rationale.

908
00:55:21,088 --> 00:55:23,921
It's gonna have to do,
being it's my car up for request.

909
00:55:23,991 --> 00:55:26,254
- Can I help you?
- A pack of cigarettes.

910
00:55:26,327 --> 00:55:29,922
- What's your point?
- You're a clerk, paid to do a job.

911
00:55:29,997 --> 00:55:33,524
You can't just do anything
you want while you're working.

912
00:55:33,601 --> 00:55:37,628
"Space alien revealed
as head of Time-Warner.

913
00:55:37,704 --> 00:55:40,731
Report stock increase."

914
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:43,538
They print any kind of shit
in this paper.

915
00:55:43,611 --> 00:55:45,545
They certainly do.
Three dollars.

916
00:55:45,613 --> 00:55:48,103
- Your argument is title dictates behavior.
- What?

917
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,549
You won't let me use your car
because I have a title and job description.

918
00:55:51,619 --> 00:55:53,883
- I'm supposed to follow it, right?
- Exactly.

919
00:55:53,955 --> 00:55:57,321
I saw one one time that said,

920
00:55:57,391 --> 00:56:00,053
"The next week,
the world is ending."

921
00:56:00,127 --> 00:56:02,561
In the next week's paper, they said,

922
00:56:02,630 --> 00:56:05,394
"We were miraculously saved
at the zero hour

923
00:56:05,466 --> 00:56:08,902
by a koala-fish mutant bird."

924
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:10,130
[Laughing]
Crazy shit.

925
00:56:10,204 --> 00:56:14,971
I'm no more responsible for my decisions
here than a death squad soldier in Bosnia?

926
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:18,068
You're not being asked to slay children
or anything.

927
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:20,739
- Yeah, not yet.
- And I remember one time...

928
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:25,751
I'm gonna break your fucking head,
you fucking jerk!

929
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:28,414
- I'm sorry. He meant to hit me.
- Well, he missed.

930
00:56:28,489 --> 00:56:31,423
Here, let me refund your money
and we'll call it even.

931
00:56:31,492 --> 00:56:33,517
I'll never come in here again.

932
00:56:33,594 --> 00:56:38,691
And if I see you again,
I'm gonna break your fucking head open!

933
00:56:41,435 --> 00:56:43,699
- What the fuck did you do that for?
- Two reasons.

934
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:47,639
One, I hate it when people can't shut up
about the stupid tabloid headlines.

935
00:56:47,708 --> 00:56:51,200
And two, to prove a point.
Title does not dictate behavior.

936
00:56:51,278 --> 00:56:54,714
- What?
- If title dictated my behavior as a clerk

937
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:57,717
I wouldn't be allowed to spit water
at that guy, but I did.

938
00:56:57,785 --> 00:57:00,379
My point is that people
dictate their own behavior.

939
00:57:00,453 --> 00:57:03,890
Even though I work in a video store,
I choose to rent movies at Big Choice.

940
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,220
Agreed?

941
00:57:05,292 --> 00:57:07,283
You are a danger
to the dead and the living.

942
00:57:07,361 --> 00:57:09,794
I like to think
I'm a master of my own destiny.

943
00:57:09,864 --> 00:57:12,890
- Please get the hell outta here.
- You know I'm your hero.

944
00:57:18,639 --> 00:57:21,005
Sounds like somebody
needs to hit the gym.

945
00:57:21,075 --> 00:57:22,064
Excuse me?

946
00:57:22,143 --> 00:57:24,168
You strained
when you picked up that milk.

947
00:57:24,245 --> 00:57:27,237
- It only weighs seven pounds.
- I didn't strain. I sighed.

948
00:57:27,314 --> 00:57:29,612
I don't think so.
That was a grunt.

949
00:57:29,683 --> 00:57:33,175
A deep inhalation of oxygen
to aid in the stretching of muscles.

950
00:57:33,254 --> 00:57:37,418
I'm a trainer. I know what that
sound signifies. You're out of shape.

951
00:57:37,491 --> 00:57:40,722
- What? There's no fat on my body.
- No fat!

952
00:57:40,795 --> 00:57:43,195
No tone either.
You don't get enough exercise.

953
00:57:43,264 --> 00:57:45,289
- You open?
- Yes.

954
00:57:45,366 --> 00:57:48,062
- Just the paper.
- Thirty-five.

955
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:51,798
Hey, uh, let me ask you a question.
Think this guy's out of shape?

956
00:57:51,872 --> 00:57:53,806
Can't really tell from here.

957
00:57:53,874 --> 00:57:56,707
- He is.
- I am not!

958
00:57:56,777 --> 00:57:58,711
How much can you bench?

959
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:01,748
- I don't know.
- I'd say about 60, 70, tops.

960
00:58:01,816 --> 00:58:03,750
I know I can bench more than that.

961
00:58:03,818 --> 00:58:06,582
- Three-fifty, four.
- No way!

962
00:58:06,654 --> 00:58:08,589
Feel that.

963
00:58:08,656 --> 00:58:11,523
Hey, that's tight.
Solid.

964
00:58:11,592 --> 00:58:13,787
Now feel this.
Roll up your sleeve, chief.

965
00:58:13,861 --> 00:58:16,386
- Oh, for God's sakes!
- See, you're ashamed.

966
00:58:16,464 --> 00:58:17,863
You know you're out of shape.

967
00:58:17,932 --> 00:58:19,991
Here.
Take my card.

968
00:58:20,067 --> 00:58:22,467
I can get you on an aerobics,
free weights program.

969
00:58:22,536 --> 00:58:25,506
- Are you open?
- [Dante] Yes. I'm not out of shape.

970
00:58:25,573 --> 00:58:27,507
Excuse me.
Have you been here all day?

971
00:58:27,575 --> 00:58:30,704
- Yeah, since 6:00 this morning.
- He's got those love handles.

972
00:58:30,778 --> 00:58:32,713
I don't have love handles!

973
00:58:32,780 --> 00:58:34,975
- Were you working here about 4:00?
- Yes.

974
00:58:35,049 --> 00:58:38,018
- It's from being around this food every day.
- Oh, I know.

975
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:41,646
If I had to work here all day,
I'd be bloated and out of shape too.

976
00:58:41,722 --> 00:58:44,452
- I'm not out of shape.
- Can I have your name, please?

977
00:58:44,525 --> 00:58:46,891
Dante Hicks. Why?
What's this all about?

978
00:58:46,961 --> 00:58:51,091
You're Dante Hicks? Oh, my God.
I didn't even recognize you.

979
00:58:51,165 --> 00:58:53,656
- Because he's out of shape!
- Do I know you?

980
00:58:53,734 --> 00:58:56,294
Do you remember Alyssa Jones?
She used to hang out...

981
00:58:56,370 --> 00:58:58,167
- With Caitlin Bree!
- I'm her sister.

982
00:58:58,239 --> 00:59:00,174
You're Alyssa's sister Heather?

983
00:59:00,241 --> 00:59:02,368
- Yeah.
- You, uh, say Caitlin Bree?

984
00:59:02,443 --> 00:59:04,502
- Yeah.
- Pretty girl?

985
00:59:04,578 --> 00:59:07,103
A little taller than her?
Gorgeous body?

986
00:59:07,181 --> 00:59:09,172
- Yeah.
- And you're Dante Hicks.

987
00:59:09,250 --> 00:59:11,275
You went to the same school,
played hockey.

988
00:59:11,353 --> 00:59:14,014
- How did you know that?
- You still goin' out with her?

989
00:59:14,088 --> 00:59:16,249
- No, she's getting married.
- To you?

990
00:59:16,323 --> 00:59:18,292
No. To an Asian design major.

991
00:59:18,359 --> 00:59:20,293
Aw, shit!

992
00:59:20,361 --> 00:59:23,661
Don't take this the wrong way,
but, uh, I used to fuck her.

993
00:59:23,731 --> 00:59:26,199
- What?
- Yeah, about two, three years ago.

994
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:29,065
While you two were dating.
I drove a black Trans Am.

995
00:59:29,136 --> 00:59:31,162
- You're Rick Derris?
- Yeah.

996
00:59:31,239 --> 00:59:33,173
- You know him?
- Yeah.

997
00:59:33,240 --> 00:59:35,765
- Caitlin talked about him all the time.
- Really?

998
00:59:35,844 --> 00:59:39,940
Wait a second. You used to fuck
Caitlin Bree while I was dating her?

999
00:59:40,015 --> 00:59:42,778
Don't let it bother you.
That was a long time ago.

1000
00:59:42,850 --> 00:59:45,148
I'm surprised you didn't
know about it.

1001
00:59:45,219 --> 00:59:47,847
Everybody in school knew about it.
Even in my class.

1002
00:59:47,922 --> 00:59:49,890
Jesus Christ! What next?

1003
00:59:49,957 --> 00:59:51,891
- Here you go.
- What's this?

1004
00:59:51,959 --> 00:59:53,722
- A fine for $500.
- What?

1005
00:59:53,795 --> 00:59:55,762
Five hundred bucks?
For what?

1006
00:59:55,830 --> 01:00:00,425
For violation of New Jersey Statute,
Section 2A, Number 170l51.

1007
01:00:00,501 --> 01:00:03,095
Any person who sells
or makes available tobacco,

1008
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:06,731
or tobacco-related products,
to persons under the age of 18,

1009
01:00:06,807 --> 01:00:08,104
is regarded as disorderly.

1010
01:00:08,175 --> 01:00:12,509
- What are you talkin' about?
- An angry mother called the state

1011
01:00:12,580 --> 01:00:14,548
and claimed
that a Quick Stop employee

1012
01:00:14,615 --> 01:00:17,709
sold her four-year-old daughter
a pack of cigarettes today.

1013
01:00:17,785 --> 01:00:20,652
The Division of Taxation
called the Board of Health

1014
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:22,655
and sent me down to issue a fine.

1015
01:00:22,724 --> 01:00:26,251
You claimed you were working here
all day. Hence, the fine is yours.

1016
01:00:26,328 --> 01:00:28,818
The fine is doubled
due to the young age of the child.

1017
01:00:28,896 --> 01:00:31,023
But I didn't sell any cigarettes
to any kids!

1018
01:00:31,098 --> 01:00:34,090
You sold cigarettes to a four-year-old?
What a scumbag!

1019
01:00:34,168 --> 01:00:36,261
That's sick, Dante.

1020
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:38,567
I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids!
I swear!

1021
01:00:38,639 --> 01:00:40,232
The due date is on the bottom.

1022
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:43,470
This summons cannot be contested
in any court of law.

1023
01:00:43,544 --> 01:00:47,378
Failure to remit will result
in a charge of criminal negligence,

1024
01:00:47,448 --> 01:00:49,609
and a warrant
will be issued for your arrest.

1025
01:00:49,683 --> 01:00:51,082
Have a nice day.

1026
01:00:51,151 --> 01:00:55,588
But I didn't sell cigarettes to any kids.
Hey, wait a minute!

1027
01:00:55,656 --> 01:01:00,218
Forget it. I don't wanna deal with a guy
that sells cigarettes to four-year-olds.

1028
01:01:00,294 --> 01:01:02,592
Can I, uh, give you
a lift somewhere?

1029
01:01:02,664 --> 01:01:05,564
Sure. How 'bout the beach?

1030
01:01:05,633 --> 01:01:07,568
I like the way you think.

1031
01:01:12,439 --> 01:01:14,373
Jesus! What next?

1032
01:01:14,441 --> 01:01:17,934
- [Woman] Dante?
- What? Caitlin!

- Just now.

1035

I can't believe it.
I haven't seen you in so long.

1036
01:01:47,509 --> 01:01:49,601
Dante, you have a customer.

1037
01:01:53,214 --> 01:01:55,546
I just saw Alyssa's
little sister outside.

1038
01:01:55,617 --> 01:01:58,586
- She was with Rick Derris.
- Let's not talk about her.

1039
01:01:58,652 --> 01:02:01,177
- How'd you get home?
- Train. It took eight hours.

1040
01:02:01,256 --> 01:02:03,746
- I can't believe you're here.
- Excuse me. Do you...

01:02:03,824 --> 01:02:06,020
Back behind the oil.
How long you staying?

1042
01:02:06,094 --> 01:02:09,085
Until Monday.
Then I have to take the train back.

1043
01:02:09,163 --> 01:02:11,256
Pack of cigarettes.
Congratulations.

1044
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:13,266
I saw the announcement
in today's paper.

1045
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,199
She's marrying
an Asian design major.

1046
01:02:15,269 --> 01:02:17,237
So I'm told.

[# hip- hop plays]

1048
01:02:46,201 --> 01:02:48,395
You're just gonna close
the store?

1049
01:02:48,469 --> 01:02:51,030
I wanna talk to you,
and I don't wanna be disturbed.

1050
01:02:51,106 --> 01:02:53,130
Something I read in the tabloids.

1051
01:02:53,208 --> 01:02:55,199
- You saw it.
- Very dramatic, I thought.

1052
01:02:55,276 --> 01:02:57,403
- It's not what you think.
- Oh, it's not.

1053
01:02:57,479 --> 01:03:00,346
What? You're pregnant
with the Asian design major's child?

1054
01:03:00,415 --> 01:03:02,406
- What's goin' on here?
- I am not pregnant.

1055
01:03:02,484 --> 01:03:05,078
Were you gonna tell me,
or send me an invitation?

1056
01:03:05,153 --> 01:03:08,087
I was gonna tell you,
but we were getting along so well.

1057
01:03:08,155 --> 01:03:09,783
You could've broken it gently.

1058
01:03:09,858 --> 01:03:13,385
You could've told me you had a boyfriend.
I told you I had a girlfriend.

1059
01:03:13,461 --> 01:03:17,488
I'm sorry, but when we started talking,
it was like I forgot I had a boyfriend.

1060
01:03:17,564 --> 01:03:19,965
- And then he proposed last month.
- You said yes.

1061
01:03:20,034 --> 01:03:21,968
Well, kind of. Sort of.

1062
01:03:22,035 --> 01:03:24,834
Is that what they teach you in school?
"Kind of," "sort of"?

1063
01:03:24,905 --> 01:03:27,636
Everybody knows!
Do you know how humiliating that is?

1064
01:03:27,709 --> 01:03:30,644
I would've told you,
and you would've stopped calling me.

1065
01:03:30,711 --> 01:03:32,680
- How do you know that?
- I know you.

1066
01:03:32,746 --> 01:03:35,442
You prefer drastic measures
to rational ones.

1067
01:03:35,516 --> 01:03:37,815
- So you're really getting married?
- No.

1068
01:03:37,886 --> 01:03:40,184
- You're not really getting married?
- [Scoffs]

1069
01:03:40,255 --> 01:03:44,588
The story goes like this: He proposed,
I told him I had to think about it,

1070
01:03:44,658 --> 01:03:46,717
and he insisted
that I wear the ring.

1071
01:03:46,794 --> 01:03:49,263
Then my mother told the paper
we were engaged.

1072
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:51,764
- I don't like her.
- Then my mother called

1073
01:03:51,833 --> 01:03:54,300
to let me know the announcement
was in the paper.

1074
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:57,497
I hopped a train to come here,
because I knew you'd be a wreck.

1075
01:03:57,572 --> 01:04:00,200
- Thanks for the vote of confidence.
- Was I right?

1076
01:04:00,274 --> 01:04:02,209
"Wreck" is a harsh term.

1077
01:04:02,277 --> 01:04:04,642
"Disturbed" is more like it.
"Mildly disturbed".

1078
01:04:04,712 --> 01:04:07,943
I love a macho facade.
It is such a turn-on.

1079
01:04:08,016 --> 01:04:11,884
- What smells like shoe polish?
- So you came here to comfort me?

1080
01:04:11,952 --> 01:04:15,150
The last thing I needed was
for you to think I was hiding something.

1081
01:04:15,223 --> 01:04:17,417
- But you were!
- No, I wasn't! Not really.

1082
01:04:17,491 --> 01:04:19,356
I told you
I'd been seeing other people.

1083
01:04:19,426 --> 01:04:21,987
But not seriously.
You're ready to walk down the aisle.

1084
01:04:22,063 --> 01:04:24,657
That constitutes something
more than seeing somebody.

1085
01:04:24,732 --> 01:04:27,758
- What's going on?
- I'm giving him his ring back.

- What?
- [Sighs] I don't want to marry him.

01:04:30,337 --> 01:04:33,306
I don't want to get married now.
I'm on the verge of graduation.

1088
01:04:33,373 --> 01:04:36,831
I want to go to grad school after this,
and then I want to start a career.

1089
01:04:36,910 --> 01:04:38,036
I don't want to be a wife

1090
01:04:38,111 --> 01:04:40,978
and then worry about
when I'm gonna fit in the other stuff.

1091
01:04:41,048 --> 01:04:43,278
I have come way too far
and studied too damn hard

1092
01:04:43,351 --> 01:04:46,911
to let my education
go to waste as a housewife.

1093
01:04:46,987 --> 01:04:48,921
And I know
that's what I'd become.

1094
01:04:48,990 --> 01:04:52,619
Sang's just signed with a major firm,
and he's gonna pull in a huge salary,

1095
01:04:52,693 --> 01:04:54,924
which would give me
no reason to work.

1096
01:04:54,996 --> 01:04:56,930
- He's very traditional.
- Wait a minute.

1097
01:04:56,998 --> 01:05:00,365
- His name is "Sang"? Past tense?
- Stop it. He's a nice guy.

1098
01:05:00,435 --> 01:05:03,029
Well, if he's so nice,
why aren't you marrying him?

1099
01:05:03,104 --> 01:05:06,267
- I just told you.
- There's more to this, isn't there?

1100
01:05:06,341 --> 01:05:09,105
Oh! Why, Mr. Hicks,
whatever do you mean?

1101
01:05:09,176 --> 01:05:12,374
- I don't have something to do with it.
- You have nothing to do with it.

1102
01:05:12,447 --> 01:05:14,574
- You lie!
- Look how full of yourself you are!

1103
01:05:14,649 --> 01:05:16,617
I believe in giving credit
where it's due.

1104
01:05:16,684 --> 01:05:19,118
I believe I'm the impetus
behind your refusal to wed.

1105
01:05:19,187 --> 01:05:23,214
If I'm so nuts about you, then why am I
having sex with an Asian design major?

01:05:23,291 --> 01:05:25,486
Oh, Jesus. You're so caustic.

1107
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:28,188
I had to knock you down
from that cloud you were on.

1108
01:05:28,263 --> 01:05:30,696
When I say I don't want to get married,
I mean that.

1109
01:05:30,765 --> 01:05:33,757
I don't want to marry anybody.
Not for years.

Who's asking?
I don't want to marry you.

1111
01:05:36,104 --> 01:05:38,629
Well, good.
Keep in that frame of mind.

1112
01:05:38,706 --> 01:05:42,197
- Well, let's date.
- Oh, I think Sang and... Veronica,

1113
01:05:42,277 --> 01:05:44,142
they'd love that.

1114
01:05:44,211 --> 01:05:46,237
We can introduce them.
They may hit it off.

1115
01:05:46,314 --> 01:05:48,441
You're serious?
You wanna date again?

1116
01:05:48,516 --> 01:05:50,450
I wanna be your boyfriend, yes.

1117
01:05:50,518 --> 01:05:53,043
It's just the shock of seeing me
after three years.

1118
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:56,056
- Believe me, you'll get over it.
- Give me a bit more credit.

1119
01:05:56,123 --> 01:05:58,058
I think it's time
we got back together.

1120
01:05:58,126 --> 01:06:01,151
I'm more mature, you're more mature.
You're finishing college.

1121
01:06:01,229 --> 01:06:03,992
- I'm already in the job market.
- You work in a market.

1122
01:06:04,065 --> 01:06:06,260
Tell me you wouldn't
wanna go out with me again

1123
01:06:06,334 --> 01:06:09,565
- after all the talking we've done.
- The key word here is "talk."

1124
01:06:09,636 --> 01:06:12,470
I think the idea,
or the conception of us dating,

1125
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,407
is a lot more idyllic than
what actually happens when we date.

1126
01:06:15,476 --> 01:06:18,410
What are we supposed to do?
Pretend over the phone we're dating?

1127
01:06:18,479 --> 01:06:20,912
I don't know.
Maybe we should just see what happens.

1128
01:06:20,982 --> 01:06:23,280
- Let me take you out tonight.
- On a date?

1129
01:06:23,351 --> 01:06:25,876
Yeah, a real date.
Dinner and a movie.

1130
01:06:25,954 --> 01:06:28,320
Oh, the "Dante Hicks
Dinner and Movie" date.

1131
01:06:28,388 --> 01:06:32,587
- I think I've been on that one before.
- Do you have a better suggestion?

1132
01:06:32,660 --> 01:06:34,593
Well, how about the "Caitlin Bree

1133
01:06:34,662 --> 01:06:38,462
Walk On The Boardwalk, Then Get
Naked Somewhere" kind of private date?

1134
01:06:38,533 --> 01:06:41,001
- I hear that's kind of a popular date.
- Jerk!

1135
01:06:41,069 --> 01:06:44,505
Here I am, throwing myself at you,
succumbing to your wily charms,

1136
01:06:44,571 --> 01:06:46,938
and you're calling me a slut
in so many words.

1137
01:06:47,008 --> 01:06:49,306
- What about Sing?
- Sang!

1138
01:06:49,376 --> 01:06:51,971
- He's not invited.
- He's your fianc.

1139
01:06:52,046 --> 01:06:55,174
I'm offering you my body,
and you're offering me semantics.

1140

you haven't gotten the drift

from Ohio...

1142
01:07:01,756 --> 01:07:04,316

to become single again.

You are the inspiration
for this bold and momentous decision

1145
01:07:10,631 --> 01:07:13,760
that will probably get me ostracized
from both school and home.

1146
01:07:13,835 --> 01:07:16,235
You ask me who I choose.

1147
01:07:16,304 --> 01:07:18,738
I choose you.

1148
01:07:18,806 --> 01:07:21,331

- You are such an asshole.

1149
01:07:21,409 --> 01:07:25,072
- I'm just kidding!
- I can already see this is not gonna work.

1150
01:07:25,146 --> 01:07:28,172
- I'll ask Randal to close up.
- Where is he, anyway?

1151
01:07:28,249 --> 01:07:30,410
I thought he'd be at your side
like a lapdog.

1152
01:07:30,485 --> 01:07:32,646
He went to go rent a movie.
He isn't back yet.

1153
01:07:32,720 --> 01:07:34,813
I'll close up and leave him a note.

1154
01:07:34,889 --> 01:07:38,483
You are too responsible.
But no, I have to go home first.

They don't even know
I've left school yet.

1156
01:07:40,928 --> 01:07:43,419
I should break the disengagement news
to my mother,

1157
01:07:43,498 --> 01:07:46,625
which is gonna cause quite a row
considering she loves Sang.

- I got fined for selling cigarettes to a minor.
- No way.

- Five hundred dollars.
- Bullshit.

1269
01:13:35,549 --> 01:13:37,710
My legs are still shaking.

1270
01:13:39,620 --> 01:13:41,953
- It wasn't me.
- [Scoffs]

1271
01:13:42,023 --> 01:13:44,458
Yeah, right.
Who was it, then? Randal?

1272
01:13:44,525 --> 01:13:46,790
- Was it you?
- I was up here the whole time.

1273
01:13:46,862 --> 01:13:49,989
- You two better quit it.
- I'm serious.

1274
01:13:50,064 --> 01:13:52,589
Oh, so we didn't
just have sex in the bathroom?

1275
01:13:52,667 --> 01:13:54,691
No.

1276
01:13:57,773 --> 01:13:59,707
Stop it.
This isn't funny.

1277
01:13:59,774 --> 01:14:02,709
I'm not fooling around.
I just came in from outside.

1278
01:14:02,778 --> 01:14:05,303
- This isn't fucking funny.
- I'm not kidding.

1279
01:14:05,379 --> 01:14:07,438
- Who went back there?
- Nobody. I swear.

1280
01:14:07,515 --> 01:14:10,007
- I feel nauseous.
- Sure there was someone there?

1281
01:14:10,085 --> 01:14:12,485
Well, I didn't just fuck myself!
Jesus Christ!

1282
01:14:12,554 --> 01:14:14,988
- I'm gonna be sick.
- You just fucked a stranger?

1283
01:14:15,057 --> 01:14:16,991
- Shut up.
- I can't believe this.

1284
01:14:17,058 --> 01:14:18,992
- Call the police.
- No, don't!

1285
01:14:19,060 --> 01:14:20,995
A stranger just raped Caitlin.

1286
01:14:21,063 --> 01:14:23,553
- She did all the work.
- Will you shut the fuck up?

1287
01:14:23,632 --> 01:14:25,929
Who the fuck's in our bathroom?

1288
01:14:26,902 --> 01:14:28,994
[Woman]
Who is he?

1289
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:32,233
[Dante] I don't know. He came in
and asked to use the bathroom.

1290
01:14:32,306 --> 01:14:34,275
- What time was this?
- I don't know.

1291
01:14:34,341 --> 01:14:36,310
What time did hockey end?

1292
01:14:36,377 --> 01:14:38,311
Um, like 3:00, 3:30.

1293
01:14:38,379 --> 01:14:41,177
- What time we get back from the funeral?
- 4:00, I think.

1294
01:14:41,248 --> 01:14:43,615
- Wait. Who was working here?
- Just me.

1295
01:14:43,684 --> 01:14:46,619
You said you went to play hockey
and then went to a funeral.

1296
01:14:46,688 --> 01:14:49,121
- Yeah, we did.
- Who was operating the store?

1297
01:14:49,191 --> 01:14:52,126
- Nobody. It was closed.
- With this guy locked in here?

1298
01:14:52,193 --> 01:14:55,526
Everything happened quickly,
I guess I forgot he was back there.

1299
01:14:55,730 --> 01:14:58,164
- [Man] Can we take it now?
- Go ahead.

1300
01:15:03,672 --> 01:15:05,866
Was he alive when Caitlin...

1301
01:15:05,940 --> 01:15:08,501
No. I place the time
of death about 3:20.

1302
01:15:08,577 --> 01:15:11,546
Then how could she... you know.

1303
01:15:11,613 --> 01:15:14,911
[Coroner] The body can maintain
erection after expiration for hours.

1304
01:15:14,983 --> 01:15:17,075
Did he have the adult magazine
when he came in?

1305
01:15:17,151 --> 01:15:21,452
No, I gave it to him.
He asked me for it.

1306
01:15:21,523 --> 01:15:25,458
I can't say for certain,
but my guess is he was masturbating,

1307
01:15:25,526 --> 01:15:28,462
his heart seized and he died.
That's when the girl found him.

1308
01:15:28,530 --> 01:15:31,123
[Sniffing]
Something smells like shoe polish.

1309
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,464
This has got to be the weirdest thing
you've ever been called in on.

1310
01:15:34,536 --> 01:15:39,269
I had to tag a kid that broke his neck
trying to put his mouth on his penis.

1311
01:15:39,341 --> 01:15:41,274
What about Caitlin?

1312
01:15:41,342 --> 01:15:44,574
[Coroner] Shock trauma.
She's gonna need years of therapy.

1313
01:15:44,646 --> 01:15:47,911
My question is, how did she come
to have sex with a dead man?

1314
01:15:47,983 --> 01:15:50,610
She thought it was me.

1315
01:15:50,684 --> 01:15:53,778
What kind of convenience store
do you run here?

1316
01:16:01,595 --> 01:16:06,465
[Siren blaring]

1317
01:16:13,275 --> 01:16:17,371
[# Humming "Theme from Jaws"]

1318
01:16:20,648 --> 01:16:22,115
Salsa shark.

1319
01:16:22,184 --> 01:16:24,516
We're gonna need a bigger boat.

1320
01:16:26,054 --> 01:16:29,512
Man goes into cage,
cage goes into salsa.

1321
01:16:29,591 --> 01:16:33,391
Shark's in the salsa.
Our shark.

1322
01:16:33,795 --> 01:16:37,060
What's with you, man? You haven't
said anything for 20 minutes.

1323
01:16:37,132 --> 01:16:38,929
What the hell's your problem?

1324
01:16:39,000 --> 01:16:40,899
- [Sighs] This life.
- This life?

1325
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:43,335
Why do I have this life?

1326
01:16:43,405 --> 01:16:45,338
Have some chips.
You'll feel better.

1327
01:16:45,406 --> 01:16:49,070
I'm stuck in this pit,
working for less than slave wages,

1328
01:16:49,144 --> 01:16:50,610
working on my day off.

1329
01:16:50,678 --> 01:16:53,273
The goddamn steel shutters
are closed.

1330
01:16:53,348 --> 01:16:57,682
I deal with every fuck on the planet.
I smell like shoe polish.

1331
01:16:57,752 --> 01:17:00,619
My ex-girlfriend is catatonic
after fucking a dead guy,

1332
01:17:00,689 --> 01:17:04,056
and my present girlfriend
has sucked 36 dicks.

1333
01:17:04,125 --> 01:17:05,114
Thirty seven.

1334
01:17:05,192 --> 01:17:08,650
My life's in the shitter, and if you
don't mind, I'd like to stew a bit.

1335
01:17:09,096 --> 01:17:12,863
- [Man] You open?
- Yeah.

1336
01:17:12,934 --> 01:17:15,903
[Randal] That's all bullshit.
Know what the real problem is?

1337
01:17:15,971 --> 01:17:17,370
I was born?

1338
01:17:17,439 --> 01:17:20,465
- You should shit or get off the pot.
- Shit or get off the pot.

1339
01:17:20,541 --> 01:17:23,010
- Yeah.
- What are you talking about?

1340
01:17:23,078 --> 01:17:26,707
This thing you have, this inability
to improve your station in life.

1341
01:17:26,781 --> 01:17:28,408
- Fuck you.
- It's true, man.

1342
01:17:28,483 --> 01:17:31,077
You blame life for dealing you
a cruddy hand,

1343
01:17:31,152 --> 01:17:33,985
never once accepting
responsibility for your situation.

1344
01:17:34,054 --> 01:17:37,387
- What responsibility?
- If you hate this job and the people...

1345
01:17:37,458 --> 01:17:40,826
and the fact that you have to
come in on your day off, why not quit?

1346
01:17:40,894 --> 01:17:43,489
- Like it's that easy.
- It is. You just up and quit.

1347
01:17:43,564 --> 01:17:45,965
There's other jobs.
They pay better money.

1348
01:17:46,034 --> 01:17:49,333
You're qualified for at least one.
So what's stopping you?

1349
01:17:49,404 --> 01:17:51,497
- Leave me alone.
- You're comfortable?

1350
01:17:51,573 --> 01:17:54,406
This is a life of convenience
and any attempt to change it

1351
01:17:54,475 --> 01:17:57,912
would shatter the pathetic microcosm
you've fashioned for yourself.

1352
01:17:57,979 --> 01:17:59,469
Like your life's any better.

1353
01:17:59,547 --> 01:18:04,712
I'm satisfied with my situation for now.
You have been bitching all day.

1354
01:18:04,786 --> 01:18:07,016
Thank you.
Go back to the video store.

1355
01:18:07,088 --> 01:18:09,112
- Same with Veronica.
- Leave her out.

1356
01:18:09,190 --> 01:18:12,886
You date Veronica because it's
convenient and she's low maintenance.

1357
01:18:12,960 --> 01:18:14,825
But all you do is talk about Caitlin.

1358
01:18:14,896 --> 01:18:17,421
You carry a torch for a girl
you dated in high school.

1359
01:18:17,498 --> 01:18:19,797
High school, for God's sakes.
You're 22.

1360
01:18:19,868 --> 01:18:23,395
- Leave me alone.
- If you want Caitlin, be with Caitlin.

1361
01:18:23,471 --> 01:18:25,962
If you want Veronica,
then be with Veronica.

1362
01:18:26,041 --> 01:18:28,235
But don't pine for one
and fuck the other.

1363
01:18:28,309 --> 01:18:30,574
Man, if you weren't
such a fucking coward...

1364
01:18:30,645 --> 01:18:32,374
If I wasn't such a fucking coward.

1365
01:18:32,447 --> 01:18:35,644
It must be great to have
this ability to simplify things.

1366
01:18:35,717 --> 01:18:37,650
- Am I right or what?
- You're wrong.

1367
01:18:37,719 --> 01:18:41,155
Things happened today
that ruined my chances with Caitlin.

1368
01:18:41,222 --> 01:18:44,521
Oh, what, the dead guy?
She'll get over fucking a dead guy.

1369
01:18:44,592 --> 01:18:48,392
Shit, my mom's been fucking a dead guy
for 30 years. I call him Dad.

1370
01:18:48,462 --> 01:18:50,795
Caitlin and I can't be together.
It's impossible.

1371
01:18:50,864 --> 01:18:54,493
Melodrama coming from you seems
as natural as an oral bowel movement.

1372
01:18:54,568 --> 01:18:57,834
What do you want me to say?
"Yes, some things you say are true"?

1373
01:18:57,906 --> 01:18:59,965
Things are not going to change.

1374
01:19:00,041 --> 01:19:02,566
- Make 'em change.
- I can't, all right?

1375
01:19:02,644 --> 01:19:04,271
Jesus, will you leave me alone?

1376
01:19:04,346 --> 01:19:07,406
I can't make changes in my life
like that. If I could, I would.

1377
01:19:07,482 --> 01:19:10,508
But I don't have the ability
to risk the comfortable situations

1378
01:19:10,585 --> 01:19:12,415
on the big money and fabulous prizes.

1379
01:19:12,487 --> 01:19:15,979
- Who are you kidding? You can so.
- Jesus H. Christ! I can't.

1380
01:19:16,057 --> 01:19:20,858
So you're gonna be miserable 'cause
you don't have the guts to face change?

1381
01:19:20,929 --> 01:19:24,558
My mother told me once
that when I was three years old,

1382
01:19:24,632 --> 01:19:26,098
my potty lid was closed,

1383
01:19:26,167 --> 01:19:29,193
and instead of me lifting it,
I shit my pants.

1384
01:19:29,270 --> 01:19:31,033
Lovely story.

1385
01:19:31,106 --> 01:19:33,403
The point is,
I'm not the type of person

1386
01:19:33,475 --> 01:19:36,933
who'll disrupt things
just so I can shit comfortably.

1387
01:19:50,492 --> 01:19:53,984
- [Door opening]
- # Noise, noise, noise, Smokin' weed

1388
01:19:54,295 --> 01:19:57,924
# Doin' coke, drinkin' beers #
Pack o' "rass," my good man.

1389
01:19:57,999 --> 01:20:00,797
Time to kick back, drink some beers
and smoke some weed!

1390
01:20:01,102 --> 01:20:04,196
- Done poisoning the youth?
- Hell, yes, whatever that means.

1391
01:20:04,271 --> 01:20:07,139
Now it's time to head over to Atlantic,
drink some beers,

1392
01:20:07,208 --> 01:20:09,108
get ripped and, hopefully, get laid.

1393
01:20:09,177 --> 01:20:12,738
- [Dante] $1.79.
- Pay the good man.

1394
01:20:12,814 --> 01:20:15,305
- Yeah, you close soon?
- In half an hour.

1395
01:20:15,383 --> 01:20:17,044
We get off the same time every day.

1396
01:20:17,118 --> 01:20:19,848
- We should hang out. You get high?
- I should start.

1397
01:20:19,921 --> 01:20:23,254
Wanna come to this party?
There's gonna be some pussy.

1398
01:20:23,324 --> 01:20:27,590
- With you? I don't think so.
- "I don't hang out with drug dealers."

1399
01:20:27,662 --> 01:20:30,495
- Nothing personal.
- What happened with that old guy?

1400
01:20:30,565 --> 01:20:33,898
- He died in the bathroom.
- I heard he was jerkin' off.

1401
01:20:33,968 --> 01:20:36,096
I don't know.
I wasn't watching.

1402
01:20:36,171 --> 01:20:39,629
He saw that Caitlin chick. I know
I felt like beatin' it when I saw her.

1403
01:20:39,707 --> 01:20:41,732
Come here, bitch.
You like this? Huh?

1404
01:20:41,810 --> 01:20:43,675
- This what you want?
- Knock it off.

1405
01:20:43,746 --> 01:20:46,976
- That used to be my girlfriend.
- Oh, you used to go out with her?

1406
01:20:47,048 --> 01:20:49,312
I thought we might
be starting again.

1407
01:20:49,385 --> 01:20:52,945
- Don't you already have a girlfriend?
- [Dante] Yeah, Veronica.

1408
01:20:53,021 --> 01:20:56,252
- You're gonna dump her for Caitlin?
- Maybe.

1409
01:20:56,324 --> 01:20:57,451
I don't know, dude.

1410
01:20:57,525 --> 01:21:00,892
Caitlin's nice, but I see Veronica
doing shit for you all the time.

1411
01:21:00,962 --> 01:21:03,795
I saw her rubbing your back,
brings your food.

1412
01:21:03,865 --> 01:21:05,890
Didn't I see her change your tire once?

1413
01:21:05,967 --> 01:21:09,835
I jacked up the car. All she did was
unloosen the nuts and put the tire on.

1414
01:21:09,905 --> 01:21:13,465
- All I know is she does a lot for you.
- She's my girlfriend.

1415
01:21:13,541 --> 01:21:17,841
I had some girlfriends too, but all
they wanted from me was weed and shit.

1416
01:21:17,912 --> 01:21:20,278
My grandmother would say,
"What's better?

1417
01:21:20,349 --> 01:21:23,283
A good plate with nothing on it?"
No, wait. I fucked up.

1418
01:21:23,351 --> 01:21:25,444
"What's a good plate
with nothing on it?"

1419
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:28,455
- Meaning?
- I don't know. She was senile.

1420
01:21:28,523 --> 01:21:32,653
She used to fuckin' piss herself
all the time, and shit herself.

1421
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:36,686
Come on, Silent Bob.
Let's get out of this fuckin' gyp joint

1422
01:21:36,764 --> 01:21:39,995
with this fuckin' faggot Dante.
You cock smoker.

1423
01:21:41,402 --> 01:21:44,394
There's a million fine-lookin' women
in the world, dude,

1424
01:21:44,472 --> 01:21:48,932
but they don't all bring you lasagna
at work. Most just cheat on you.

1425
01:21:49,011 --> 01:21:50,773
[Jay]
Come on, limp dick!

1426
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:53,370
[Silent Bob]
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1427
01:21:54,782 --> 01:21:56,773
He's right.

1428
01:21:56,851 --> 01:21:59,411
I love her.

1429
01:21:59,721 --> 01:22:03,418
That's it. He doesn't love you anymore.
He loves Caitlin.

1430
01:22:03,491 --> 01:22:05,585
And he told you all of this?

1431
01:22:05,660 --> 01:22:09,960
Pretty much. All except the latent
homosexuality part. That's my theory.

1432
01:22:10,031 --> 01:22:12,397
I don't know what to say.

1433
01:22:12,467 --> 01:22:16,335
Don't hold it against him. He just
never got Caitlin out of his system.

1434
01:22:16,404 --> 01:22:19,430
It's not your fault.
It's Dante.

1435
01:22:20,075 --> 01:22:22,475
Look. I don't know thing one
about chicks.

1436
01:22:22,544 --> 01:22:25,513
So if you gotta cry or something,
I can get out of here.

1437
01:22:25,580 --> 01:22:27,980
- I'm not sad.
- You're not?

1438
01:22:28,049 --> 01:22:29,744
What did you do that for?

1439
01:22:29,817 --> 01:22:32,980
If you didn't wanna go out with me,
why didn't you say so?

1440
01:22:33,054 --> 01:22:35,523
Instead you pussyfoot around
and see that slut!

1441
01:22:35,590 --> 01:22:37,854
- What?
- You've been talking to her for weeks!

1442
01:22:37,926 --> 01:22:39,053
Only a few times.

1443
01:22:39,127 --> 01:22:42,324
Then you freak out because
I've gone down on a couple of guys.

1444
01:22:42,397 --> 01:22:43,386
Oh, a couple?

1445
01:22:43,465 --> 01:22:47,798
I'm not trying to patch up with my ex,
sneaking around behind your back!

1446
01:22:47,869 --> 01:22:49,838
If you think 37 dicks are a lot,
just wait.

1447
01:22:49,904 --> 01:22:53,305
I'm going to put the hookers
in Times Square to shame!

1448
01:22:53,374 --> 01:22:55,137
- Will you let me explain?
- What?

1449
01:22:55,210 --> 01:22:59,236
How you've been waiting until the time
was right to dump me for her?

1450
01:22:59,314 --> 01:23:01,407
- It isn't like that!
- Damn right!

1451
01:23:01,483 --> 01:23:04,849
I won't let it be like that.
You want your slut? Fine.

1452
01:23:04,920 --> 01:23:07,445
- I don't want Caitlin.
- You don't know what you want!

1453
01:23:07,522 --> 01:23:10,787
But I'm not going to hold your hand
anymore until you figure it out!

1454
01:23:10,858 --> 01:23:12,417
I've tried with you, Dante.

1455
01:23:12,494 --> 01:23:16,088
I've encouraged you to get out of this
fucking dump and go back to school,

1456
01:23:16,164 --> 01:23:18,029
to take charge and find direction.

1457
01:23:18,099 --> 01:23:21,626
I transferred so maybe you'd be more
inclined to go back if I was with you.

1458
01:23:21,703 --> 01:23:25,161
Everyone said it was a stupid move,
but I didn't care because I loved you

1459
01:23:25,240 --> 01:23:27,673
and wanted to see you
pull yourself out of this funk

1460
01:23:27,743 --> 01:23:30,906
that you've been in since that whore
dumped you so many years ago.

1461
01:23:30,980 --> 01:23:33,413
You wanna go back to her
so she can fuck you over more!

1462
01:23:33,482 --> 01:23:35,712
- I don't wanna go back...
- Of course. Not now.

1463
01:23:35,784 --> 01:23:38,753
You're caught,
and now you're trying to snake out.

1464
01:23:38,820 --> 01:23:43,120
I want you to follow through so you
can find out what an idiot you are.

1465
01:23:43,192 --> 01:23:45,956
And when she dumps you again,
and I promise you, she will,

1466
01:23:46,027 --> 01:23:48,723
when she dumps you again
I want to laugh in your face

1467
01:23:48,796 --> 01:23:51,924
so you realize what you gave up
our relationship for.

1468
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,834
I'm glad Randal had the balls
to tell me since you couldn't.

1469
01:23:54,902 --> 01:23:58,394
Having him tell me was
the weakest move ever. You're spineless.

1470
01:23:58,473 --> 01:24:01,704
- Veronica, I love you.
- Fuck you!

1471
01:24:02,477 --> 01:24:05,469
[Gong ringing]

1472
01:24:17,225 --> 01:24:19,160
Dante?

1473
01:24:21,229 --> 01:24:24,893
# Our problems seem a world away

1474
01:24:26,134 --> 01:24:28,126
# Close your eyes

1475
01:24:28,203 --> 01:24:31,070
# And they'll all go away

1476
01:24:31,139 --> 01:24:35,804
# Close the night and listen

1477
01:24:35,878 --> 01:24:40,007
# Close your eyes to me

1478
01:24:40,081 --> 01:24:42,515
# And sell the lie

1479
01:24:42,583 --> 01:24:45,211
# My face

1480
01:24:45,287 --> 01:24:47,846
# Shall live

1481
01:24:47,922 --> 01:24:50,687
# You'll all be replaced #

1482
01:24:50,759 --> 01:24:53,056
How's your eye?

1483
01:24:53,127 --> 01:24:56,358
The swelling's not that bad,
but the F.D.S. Stings.

1484
01:24:57,832 --> 01:25:01,496
- How's your neck?
- It's kind of hard to swallow.

1485
01:25:02,537 --> 01:25:04,505
You didn't have to choke me,
you know.

1486
01:25:04,572 --> 01:25:07,939
Why did you tell Veronica I was
gonna dump her to go with Caitlin?

1487
01:25:08,009 --> 01:25:10,978
- I thought I was doing you a favor.
- Oh, Jesus.

1488
01:25:11,045 --> 01:25:13,606
You're always saying
how you can't initiate change.

1489
01:25:13,682 --> 01:25:17,276
- I thought I'd give you a hand.
- Thanks.

1490
01:25:17,351 --> 01:25:19,285
You still didn't have to choke me.

1491
01:25:19,353 --> 01:25:22,289
Oh, please.
I'm surprised I didn't kill you.

1492
01:25:22,357 --> 01:25:24,222
- Why do you say that?
- Why do I say that?

1493
01:25:24,292 --> 01:25:26,055
Forget it.

1494
01:25:26,127 --> 01:25:28,186
No, really.
What did I do that was so wrong?

1495
01:25:28,262 --> 01:25:29,661
What don't you do?

1496
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:32,929
Sometimes I think you come to work
to make my life miserable.

1497
01:25:33,001 --> 01:25:35,366
- How do you figure?
- What time did you get to work?

1498
01:25:35,436 --> 01:25:37,837
Like 10:00, or ten after.

1499
01:25:37,906 --> 01:25:40,966
You were half an hour late.
And then all you do is come in here.

1500
01:25:41,043 --> 01:25:44,843
- Yeah, to talk to you.
- Which means the video store is closed.

1501
01:25:44,913 --> 01:25:48,609
- It's not like I'm miles away.
- Unless you're out renting videos.

1502
01:25:48,683 --> 01:25:51,550
Hermaphrodites. I rented it
so we could watch it together.

1503
01:25:51,619 --> 01:25:53,087
You get me slapped with a fine.

1504
01:25:53,155 --> 01:25:56,215
You argue with the customers,
and I have to patch everything up.

1505
01:25:56,291 --> 01:25:59,089
You get us thrown out of a funeral
by violating the corpse.

1506
01:25:59,161 --> 01:26:02,494
To top it off, you ruin my relationship.
What's your encore?

1507
01:26:02,563 --> 01:26:06,260
Do you, like, anally rape my mother
while pouring sugar in my gas tank?

1508
01:26:08,771 --> 01:26:12,069
You know what the real tragedy
about all of this is?

1509
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:14,268
I'm not even supposed
to be here today!

1510
01:26:14,343 --> 01:26:17,744
Oh, fuck you!
Fuck you, pal!

1511
01:26:17,812 --> 01:26:19,939
Jesus, there you go,
trying to pass the buck.

1512
01:26:20,014 --> 01:26:21,948
I'm the source of all your misery.

1513
01:26:22,017 --> 01:26:25,646
Who closed the store to play hockey?
Who closed the store to go to a wake?

1514
01:26:25,721 --> 01:26:28,086
Who tried to win back
his ex-girlfriend

1515
01:26:28,156 --> 01:26:31,148
without even discussing
how he felt with his present one?

1516
01:26:31,226 --> 01:26:33,387
You wanna blame somebody?
Blame yourself.

1517
01:26:33,462 --> 01:26:35,521
"I'm not even supposed
to be here today."

1518
01:26:35,597 --> 01:26:37,360
You sound like an asshole!

1519
01:26:37,432 --> 01:26:39,456
Jesus, nobody twisted
your arm to be here.

1520
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:41,593
You're here of your own volition.

1521
01:26:41,670 --> 01:26:44,604
You like to think the weight
of the world rests on your shoulder,

1522
01:26:44,673 --> 01:26:47,039
like this would fall apart
if Dante wasn't here.

1523
01:26:47,108 --> 01:26:50,805
Jesus, you overcompensate for having
what's basically a monkey's job.

1524
01:26:50,878 --> 01:26:55,509
You push fuckin' buttons. Anybody
could waltz in here and do our jobs.

1525
01:26:55,584 --> 01:26:58,848
You're so obsessed
with making it seem so much more epic,

1526
01:26:58,920 --> 01:27:01,321
so much more important
than it really is.

1527
01:27:01,390 --> 01:27:05,985
Christ, you work in a convenience store,
Dante, and badly, I might add.

1528
01:27:06,060 --> 01:27:09,326
I work in a shitty video store,
badly as well.

1529
01:27:09,397 --> 01:27:13,334
That guy Jay's got it right.
He has no delusions about what he does.

1530
01:27:13,402 --> 01:27:16,200
We like to make ourselves
seem more important

1531
01:27:16,271 --> 01:27:19,365
than the people that come in
to buy a paper or cigarettes.

1532
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:22,001
We look down on them
as if we're so advanced.

1533
01:27:22,077 --> 01:27:25,877
Well, if we're so fuckin' advanced,
what are we doin' workin' here?

1534
01:27:44,432 --> 01:27:47,891
Hey, the floor looks pretty clean.
I put the cat next door.

1535
01:27:47,970 --> 01:27:51,406
- Need a ride home?
- No, I got one. Just pulled up.

1536
01:27:52,006 --> 01:27:55,408
- You workin' tomorrow?
- Same time. What about you?

1537
01:27:55,477 --> 01:27:58,913
I'm callin' out.
Goin' to the hospital and visit Caitlin.

1538
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:01,415
And then I'm gonna
try to talk to Veronica.

1539
01:28:01,483 --> 01:28:05,647
You wanna grab a bite to eat when you're
done with that and I get off work?

1540
01:28:05,721 --> 01:28:08,655
- I'll give you a call, let you know.
- All right.

1541
01:28:08,723 --> 01:28:10,692
Hey, good luck with Veronica.

1542
01:28:10,758 --> 01:28:12,886
I can talk to her,
try to straighten...

1543
01:28:12,961 --> 01:28:15,623
No, thanks.
I think I can handle it.

1544
01:28:15,697 --> 01:28:18,427
We have a lot of shit to talk about.

1545
01:28:18,500 --> 01:28:21,492
- Hell of a day.
- To say the least.

1546
01:28:21,569 --> 01:28:24,505
Want me to do anything
before I get out of here, man?

1547
01:28:24,573 --> 01:28:26,200
Why don't you wrangle for me?

1548
01:28:26,275 --> 01:28:28,937
- [Scoffs] No.
- Come on. Just wrangle out the door.

1549
01:28:29,011 --> 01:28:31,707
- No. No, no, no.
- Come on.
